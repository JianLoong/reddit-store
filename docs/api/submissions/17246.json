That ability does not make me a mechanic.", "NTA- Everyone has different views on AI \"Art\". But at the end of the day, it's your gallery and you get to choose whether or not you feel the art has earned it's place there. (Personally, I think anything AI creates is NOT art. The literal definition of art includes the fact it comes from human imagination etc. Not to mention, it steals from actual human artists and mashes their hard work together to 'create' a 'new' piece.)", "NTA.\n\nAi steals content from other artist", "NTA: you\u2019re actually setting yourself and the kid up for some backlash by accepting this Ai work as art. I really recommend reading the article about the Ai photograph that won a contest. I personally think Ai can be used as a tool like how we use photoshop now. \n\nIn this case however, given that the work is completely Ai made I wouldn\u2019t call this original art by the kid. This work should not be presented unless you want to disclaim it.\n\nHowever, again you\u2019re setting that kid up for some major backlash if you do that. The art world is not happy that Ai programs sample other artists work to create other works. It\u2019s been an on going hot topic in this world.\n\nThis will be a growing issue for you and galleries going forward. \n\nyou need to make guidelines about Ai art. It\u2019s only going to more common as time goes on. Take this as a sign and start taking steps to address it.\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-my-ai-image-won-a-major-photography-competition/?amp=true", "Nta, AI not onky isnt real art, but its stealing from real artists to make those images without their consent.

If I were operating a gallery,  or even a coffee house that features local artists,  my policy for submissions would be that AI generated images will not be considered.

AI art generates images by stealing the work of existing artists and mashing it together. It's theft, and honestly you'll be doing the kid a favor by teaching him that shit won't fly in the industry NOW. Maybe he'll learn and actually create his own work.", "NTA.

But, this is going to come up more and a definitive policy about AI art is needed.", "NTA\n\n\nThe models that generate AI art are often trained on art made by human artists without those artists' permission.  Using AI art to make money or get recognition as an artist is pretty much the same thing as tracing someone else's work in my mind.", "NTA \nAI art is something artists have very strong feelings about, most of us being against it. It would potentially alienate you from the community you are trying to showcase", "NTA. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA and you need to create policies on AI art", "NTA. Unless that kid created EVERY piece of art used for the \"training Data\" of that AI, it's stolen work .", "NTA do not allow any ai art all it does is 1 steal from artists and 2 devalues your entire group imo it devalues the artists and tells them they are on par with ai art and that it has a \"place\" in these communities when it shouldnt.it also sets him up more so for failure imo as he will use the easy way out (ai art) rather then try to actual tune an ability and hone his skill. I understand he's a child but you'd be opening up your organization to backlash and hate and with how ai is a buzzword rn I really feel it could be detrimental if people get hung up on it.", "NTA. *AI ART IS NOT REAL ART*. The way it works is by stealing and basically mashing up ACTUAL artists art.", "NAH\n\nThe jury is still out on just how much AI art is the product of the person who sets up the prompt and makes the tweaks and selects the final image. The kid and you come down on opposite sides of the debate. No shame, no assholes.", "I don't quite know how I feel about AI generated artwork myself BUT I do want to note that every \"new\" artform wasn't accepted at the time it started. \n\nAbstract painters were accused of being talentless, for example, and in a more recent setting; digital painting/drawing still doesn't get the appreciation it deserves. \n\nIt's not because it doesn't require talent in the sense that we know that it doesn't require talent at all. \n\nPersonally, i'd give the kid a chance. In doing so you stimulate him to keep exploring art and you might end up being on the right side of history with this one. \n\nPlus, you like the designs, so I see at least 3 reasons to give it a go and 0 reasons not to.\n\nYWNTA as it is your gallery and your choice, but i'd advice against it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
