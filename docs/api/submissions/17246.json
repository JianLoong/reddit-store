If you state that something is AI generated then maybe it's not as bad.  This, in reality, is a brand new form of art, IMO.  Considering everything, this is potentially going to be part of the future.  We all need to figure out how these things are going to be seen and categorized. Art shouldnt be censored. (I know, this is a tough one) When the camera became an artistic tool some people thought it was a bad thing. Im not here for a debate, but it just seems like no one's going to be able to stop it.  So how do we categorize it?  NAH. Bring it.", "NTA\n\n\nIsn\u2019t there some questionability of AIs using parts of copyrighted images?", "NTA like ai art might make some cool things and art is really just about creativity using all sorts of mediums. Sure kid typed in some words that may be creative and someone else won't be able to replicate what they made(maybe). I feel like art should remain human. It just seems kind of lame for someone to try and get into an art gallery where other people have spent insane amounts of time and effort to get into. Even for a kid, it's pretty lame. At most it took kid maybe 10 minutes to come up with some cool keywords.", "While i think you are NTA, also you are better equipped than any of us to judge", "NTA, I definitely have mixed feelings about AI generated images and text. But just like with all new technology it's here wether we are ready for it or not. \n\nCould you maybe, if you have space, make a section where you display it and be clear that it is AI generated. While I don't think AI art is as impressive as traditional art it's still pretty impressive with some of the images they come up with. Mabey AI images will not be as bad if we start separating it early on from traditional art, being clear how the art was created. That in of itself could benefit traditional art, a little bit of inform next to the art on how it was made, the methods and how long it took.", "NTA but I\u2019m a biased starving artist", "He's not an artist and didn't submit art, he submitted AI generated garbage based on thefted art from actual artist. NTA, the kid is.", "NTA if the kid didn\u2019t create the image from scratch with their own hands (either traditional, digital etc) then they are not an artist.", "NTA.  In fact you WOULDBTA if you accepted it.  It's not his art.  It's a computer program's art.  If he wants to be an artist he needs to do his own work.", "I think this is def a learning opportunity. \n\nExplain to the young artist that while there is a level of creation it might not what you\u2019re looking for to include into your gallery. However, if he figures out a way to apply the generated images into some type of design, or artwork (craft, collage et al.) you\u2019d be more than happy to include the pieces. \n\nYou can always explain that ai generated images are still too new of a technology / tool and you haven\u2019t properly been able to assess it. Unfortunately you won\u2019t be able to in the foreseeable future as well. \n\nLet him down easily and provide options would be the best route. Good luck!\n\nNTA.", "AI generated images doesn't make you an artist any more than ordering from a restaurant makes you a chef. The algorithms also steal from real artists, it would be a slap in the face to display this \"work\".", "I wonder how this differs from collage using images created by other artists.", "Well I mean technically AI art does come from human imagination, its just the imagination that was used for other artworks are used to create this one. I'd call it art but it's art that belongs to the owners/artists of the art that is part of the data set. Arts just needs to create emotion. There's been some pretty cool AI art but it just means the data set artworks are just as cool.", "\ud83d\udcaf Art theft", "AI \u201cart\u201d is generated from existing artists work. It is literally stolen. It is NOT art. The only \u201ctalent\u201d involved is typing a few keywords into the computer.", "Typing some words into a computer and having the program steal from the work of real artists is in no way \u201cart.\u201d There\u2019s nothing tough about it.", "I think that is the best course of action here. Rejecting AI-generated art is not the same as rejecting the kid's dreams of becoming an artist, and I think that needs to be made very clear to him.", "Sounds like your curator needs an education as well!", "I absolutely agree. Its definitely not in any way the same.  My point is it isn't going away. It shouldn't be compared to real works of art, it should be compartmentalized differently,  separately.", "I would for sure.  As an artist myself, I wouldn't want to se AI artwork included in a gallery like that.\n\nI would let them know that's your decision for all submissions, and if he has any actual artwork, you'd be happy to consider it.", "NTA.\n\nSome kids actually have talent that is developed after years of practice, painting and learning.
