I\u2019m autistic, it took years to learn how to talk to people, and I do honestly think most people would find what she said abrupt and rude.

And if she has lots of these idiosyncratic preferences, it might in fact be hard to live with her, just like you said.

I laugh because it's such a small issue. It bothers me yes, but do I think my girl is an AH? No, she's a woman and in my experience, women wear men's clothing when they want to.
