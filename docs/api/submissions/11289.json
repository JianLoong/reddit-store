I\u2019m autistic, it took years to learn how to talk to people, and I do honestly think most people would find what she said abrupt and rude.

And if she has lots of these idiosyncratic preferences, it might in fact be hard to live with her, just like you said.

I laugh because it's such a small issue. It bothers me yes, but do I think my girl is an AH? No, she's a woman and in my experience, women wear men's clothing when they want to.

She was already being patient and kind by reiterating she doesn\u2019t want you wearing her clothes more than once. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have room for your stuff in your suitcase then you should\u2019ve just told her that if you\u2019re unable to wear her things to make space then she\u2019d need to pay to check baggage for her clothes.", "This is an easy one. \n\n\u201cHey I realized you were really upset when I put on your jacket. I didn\u2019t think it would be an issue but I realize now it was.\u201d\n\u201cYes I\u2019m mad.\u201d\n\u201cTotally hear you. Since we\u2019re moving in together, I\u2019d love to understand more about why that upsets you so we can make sure we don\u2019t get in an argument like that again.\u201d\n\nOP, just because it wouldn\u2019t upset you doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t upset her. It would do you well to address the actual issue, rather than blow it up into a bigger picture \u201cmassive problem.\u201d", "Maybe because of shipment costs. OP said they live in different countries. It could be that OP lives in the same country the store is in, so it's cheaper to ship it there and for OP to take the clothes with him to girlfriend.", "Don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting downvoted. I guess tone in text messages is often hard to read, but I also read the text as very curt and kinda rude in the context of being sent to someone who you\u2019ve been dating for awhile who is doing you a big favor. That being said, I think this case is more ESH than N-T-A because OP suddenly escalating the conversation to, yeah well maybe I don\u2019t want to live with you anymore, is pretty darn shitty.", "Is she really inconveniencing him by asking him not to wear her clothes?\n\nIt's not like she demanded that he fold it and pack it a certain way.  She literally just asked him not to wear it.", "So do you! But only one of us is unhappy about it.", "Setting boundaries is good for everyone.  You're doing both of you harm if you don't set boundaries, too, and are basing your decisions on her needs without considering your own", "I don't think you are the AH. I think there's a lot of immature people here that don't have relationship experience. \n\nI've dated about a dozen girls between 15-30 and am in a 5 year relationship currently. I have not met a single woman that respects my boundary of \"please don't wear my sweatshirt/jacket/etc.\" \n\nIn fact, I actually bickered with my fiance last night briefly because she stole my favorite jacket because she looks good in it lmao. \n\nSo I'm over here and reading all the replies and all I can think of is: wear that fucking jacket OP. Wear it twice. I think you're being bashed here because you're a man. Find me a woman who won't steal a shirt or sweatshirt from their man and I'll change my mind, but holy shit the gender roles here are very unbalanced on Reddit.", "You are NTA. It absolutely IS weird that she got all bizarre about you trying on her clothes for a joke. She sounds controlling, but because she is a woman, Redditors are assuming you are a man (me too, honestly), and therefore it couldn't possibly be that you have finally snapped at a controlling and dominating woman. Reddit is bullshit, dear. See a counselor and get some good advice. The fact that you actually want to see a counselor leads me to believe it's her not you. Don't take Reddit's word for it and end up enduring years of this woman's obnoxious behavior.", "Unfortunately on Reddit you can't say this without being a \"sexist, misogynistic abuser\" who doesn't respect boundaries. \n\nI've been with a woman just like this and let me tell ya, you'll find it very hard to convince anyone that what she is doing is controlling and abusive, but it is just that by textbook definition.", "Good NTA. \n\nSorry for all the comments saying you are. My husband puts on my clothes all the time (he\u2019s not a cross dresser he just likes to put them on as a joke then take them off). And we are definitely different sizes. If there was ever something I didn\u2019t want him to ruin I let him know. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t take me seriously but it\u2019s not a dealbreaker. It just seems like this whole situation got out of hand and became more serious than it needed to (could it be because of deep rooted issues that need to be discussed?)", "Yea, that does seem to be a bit too much. But as to the actual issue, she did ask you politely not to wear her clothes, even if you're in a relationship she's allowed to ask that. You could also politely ask that she not ship clothes to your place that you have to then cart over to her in a different country, but that's a different issue.", "OK, stupid question, but what do you do on the way home? Unless you have some way of vacuum sealing on the go?", "Ok that's good. Thanks for that! I'm gonna try to talk to her about this in a few days when she and I both have had some time to think about what happened and why", "But what about GF? Is she even thanking OP or acknowledging she\u2019s asking a massive favor? She should have said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry i guess I ordered too much stuff. I didn\u2019t think it would take up so much space. However, I\u2019d prefer you not wear the jacket. Just in case I need to return it. Maybe you can carry it on in a backpack?\u201d OP\u2019s  doing her a favor. Her tone doesn\u2019t sound nice.", "That's good advice. Thank you. I should keep me in mind too... But usually it's like I genuinely don't care if I have to do things slightly differently for her. It does get too much sometimes. Especially when I'm constantly being told how to do things or how she wants things done", "There are definitely some issues that we need to talk about, but whenever I bring this up her response is \"yeah, I'm difficult, I told you in the beginning, and you said it's fine\". Well yes, I did but I didn't realise the extent to which this would be true. I'm not sure she will change tbh... She's quite stubborn usually - I'm ok with this since I think I can bend myself for her.   \n\n\nAnd yes, thank you! I was maybe also being a little funny putting on her jacket (which fit me perfectly, so I wasn't ruining the shape or anything). And she came back with a stone-cold \"get off my property\" kind of statement. Ok I'm exaggerating but just so you see my point  \n\n\nTo be clear, I love her to bits, we have the best time together, we laugh a lot and just feels amazing, even the everyday routine (the boring part of a relationship) sometimes feels amazing. But I'm starting to think it's partly because I just bend to her every need and want.", "It\u2019s just a bag, like a big ziploc bag. You put the clothes in it flat and roll it up to take the air out then you unroll it again and the clothes are flat, not puffy. They are usually called space bags", "Having calm conversations about hard topics is so important in relationships. I've only been married 3 years, but I've been living with my husband for 7. We've learned that text is the absolute best way to miscommunicate. If you are ever questioning tone in text, give your GF a call. Ask how she meant the message to come across, tell her why the text rubbed you the wrong way, then discuss. Why did it upset you? What made it sound rude? Is there a way to avoid this in the future? Relationships are a struggle sometimes, but if you can work through the kinks along the way, you end up with something beautiful.", "Yeah I get that.  I think that's the problem with being flexible without considering yourself.  It becomes a habit, and before you know it, you've agreed to more than you wish you had.  Can your gf handle it when you say you want to do something differently than her?", "Oh thank you! My mind was muddled with images of some huge device I saw in infomercials in my youth.", "Sometimes, yes, but usually no. She is uncomfortable the entire time and then ends up having a bad mood. And then when I finally cave, she's like \"AH THANK YOU!\"   \n\n\nWe both have to do things with each other that the other person enjoys more, and I think that she never does that...", "There are bags you can use with a vacuum hose still around lol", "Have you guys had a conversation about how that makes you feel?", "We have, but it usually just ends in her saying \"yeah, I'm a control freak and I told you I'll be hard to live with\"  \n\n\nWhile that's true, I think she doesn't really recognise my feelings... We have had this once or twice before but just ended up moving on without REALLY addressing it.  \n\n\nEven with this little argument, I think both people are to blame to some extent, but she will never admit her mistake. She doesn't see her mistake ever - it's always mine. I agree in this case, maybe it was? But it's never 100% - 0%, you know?"]}
