And if she has lots of these idiosyncratic preferences, it might in fact be hard to live with her, just like you said.

I laugh because it's such a small issue. It bothers me yes, but do I think my girl is an AH? No, she's a woman and in my experience, women wear men's clothing when they want to.

Whatever her reasoning is for not wanting people to wear her clothes, she very calmly and politely told you not to wear her clothes. She set that boundary.

My thing is that no matter who you are, you will never get along 100% with a person you live with.  Doesn't matter who they are or how long you have known them.  There are things they will do that will drive you crazy and there are things that you do that will drive them crazy.  The most important thing is how you handle those situations.  That is what determines whether living together will work or not. From the sounds of it, you are probably not going to handle things appropriately.  At least not if you treat those situations like this one.  It will be better for both of you if you figure out how to deal with (or if you are even able to deal with) her \"little quirks\" before you make the leap to move in together.

If not, let me know why you made the joke so I can give better advice.\n\nEven though I don\u2019t want to because I feel like this is a petty argument you guys had and could be fixed with like a little more respect from you, YTA.", "This is clearly one of many situations that the OP os concerned about.", "She can be more mad. No one is saying OP has to please her with every action taken. But the gf is also allowed to say if something makes her uncomfortable. \n\nDon\u2019t we all have our own weird preferences and wouldn\u2019t we all like our partners to respect our preferences to some degree ? \n\nI don\u2019t like people wearing shoes in my house and especially don\u2019t like people putting shoes on my furniture. I don\u2019t see why it would be different for me to say to my partner or friend \u201cplease don\u2019t wear your shoes in my house. I don\u2019t like when people do that\u201d", ">OP is right. This is a pretty weird way to phrase it instead of saying, you know, something human like \"oooo nooo don't wear that, your broader frame might ruin it lol\". \n\nThat sounds way ruder to me.", "Your way or the highway eh?", "Yes but there is no reason to think that what op did is a habit they have of borrowing clothes from the girlfriend for their self pleasure, it was a response to a practical problem which does not cross boundaries, because op's not getting personal use of the jacket", "Jesus, exaggerate a little more. He put on a loose-fitting jacket to make a good natured joke about how full his suitcase was. Nothing was ruined and he wasn\u2019t disrespecting her time and money, but she clearly has no regard for his. What about the time and effort it takes him to receive and unbox all of her deliveries, figure out a way to pack all of it up while still having room for his own clothes, then travel internationally with all her stuff? Instead of saying something like \u201cI really appreciate you bringing my stuff to me, but can you please not wear it? If the jacket won\u2019t fit can you please just bring it with you next time (or some alternative solution)?\u201d It\u2019s incredibly rude and dismissive to see that her clothes are taking up so much room that they can\u2019t all fit, and her only response was \u201cplease don\u2019t wear them\u201d.", "And how do you respond to this? Do you tell her you don\u2019t want to watch her choice on Netflix or that you don\u2019t want her to micromanage you? You are not required to meet her needs, but it\u2019s unfair of you to not communicate your needs and keep letting this stuff secretly bother you", "Yeah they do sound single af lol\nIt's kind of a thing in relationships to borrow each other's things, like it's sooooo cute and sexy if a girlfriend wears her boyfriend's t-shirt or sweatshirt but it's not okay for OP to put on his girlfriends jacket and take a pic? \nMy husband and I don't even ask each other lol I just go into his wardrobe and grab his socks or his hoodie, and he's worn my pajama pants and other stuff. I mean OP handled his gf's boundaries very poorly but still lol. For a normal  and happy couple I'd say sharing is a very very common thing.", "Absolutely she\u2019s allowed to have preferences and feel upset! OP stated a few times in the comments that she has said herself that she\u2019s a control freak and would be hard to live with. The difference is, if someone was coming into your house, you\u2019d probably say \u201chey, shoes off!\u201d before they came into your house and the potential problem would be solved before it even began", "OP could also ask for that even if it\u2019s not offered. Either way, seems reasonable.", "I agree with your comment except she already explained that she just doesn\u2019t like when other people wear her clothes. It\u2019s not an attack on OP it\u2019s just a statement of fact. \n\nOP. If the space is a problem just ask her about paying for an additional bag, separating the clothes into multiple trips since you said you go there, not having the clothes delivered to your house anymore if this is going to be a problem for you,", "In that context they weren't wearing the jacket for fun, it was a way of doing her a favor or a kindness, just like baking cookies. The point is that there are many ways of responding to that, this way is a little bit cold and passive-aggressive imo, given the context.", "Plus, what if gf needs to return it? She can't if OP is sweating in it and ruining it.", "I don\u2019t see what difference it makes if I said it the second they got to my house, or maybe I\u2019m in the rest room when they arrived and I notice it 30 min later. \n\nI don\u2019t see why it\u2019s so hard for some people to hear other peoples boundaries as if it\u2019s a deep personal criticism. It\u2019s not an insult to OP. It\u2019s just \u201cI don\u2019t like other people wearing my clothes\u201d", "Maybe they don\u2019t ship to the country she lives in though", "No, because you should look at OP's point of view. It goes both ways. All the clothes she is buying are taking up too much space in his suitcase. You don't get to have someone do something for you, because it's more convenient for you and less money to spend and get mad at what they are trying to compromise. I agree with OP's girlfriendnot wearing the jacket and like the gf said, wrap it around you. But if it's to the point where it's too much of a hassle for OP to be always taking her clothes to her. On top of that, causing an issue.  What OP needs to do is, have her pay for the extra luggage then or stop sending it over to OP's house, period. It's that easy and simple.", "No no, her calf\u2019s were, and still are,  glories and she was also really tiny everywhere else. So her shirts were smaller I had chicken legs.", "Okay, well let\u2019s expand the example to fit the vibe a little better. Say you have your friends over for a dinner party. They arrive, you\u2019re in the bathroom for some reason and they come inside. You immediately say \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t wait until I came out of the bathroom to enter!!\u201d, they apologize. Then, you critique how their hair looks, and they nervously laugh it off and suggest everyone plays a game. You **hate** this idea. You planned on everyone talking and catching up! Now your mood is ruined, and you act visibly miserable making everyone uncomfortable. Then\u2026 you notice it\u2026 the shoes are on in your house!! You look over, and say \u201cTake your shoes off in my house. Thank you I hate when people wear shoes in my house\u201d \n\nPretty sure no one would want to come back to your house again for a dinner party. Maybe no one will verbally say that, but maybe they will. It depends how often you act like that towards your friends. A lot of times people let things bubble up until they pop, and that seems like what happened for OP", "it is that simple, but what OP needs to do is sit down and have a conversation about it like an adult, rather than flipping out and making it about how she's going to be \"hard to live with\". also, you absolutely can ask someone to do something for you and get mad when they try to compromise if they compromise by steamrolling your boundaries and THEN asking about it.", "Honestly, it was probably as unobtrusive as it was going to be in the condition it was shipped in.", "Yes, in your example, maybe people wouldn\u2019t wanna come back to my house if I acted like that and I think that\u2019s fair. I also think it would be fair for my friends to say it to my face, or even ghost me if they are that uncomfortable with confrontation. People are not required to tolerate behavior that makes them feel bad, regardless of how anyone else sees the validity of their reasoning. \n\nI also feel like the example you gave here is way passed setting one boundary like in OPs example. It would be comparable if it stopped at the bathroom part of this scene you\u2019ve lain out here. \n\nGf says \u201cplease don\u2019t wear my clothes\u201d; OP could say;\n\n\u201coh okay, I won\u2019t, but I dont have room to fit the jacket so I\u2019ll have to leave it behind then\u201d or \n\n\u201coh my bad I was trying to be funny but I didn\u2019t realize that this was something that makes you feel uncomfortable. I won\u2019t make jokes like this in the future if it bothers you\u201d or even \n\n\u201cok I\u2019ll respect your boundary, but I don\u2019t really understand it\u201d \n\nI\u2019m not saying OP has to obey gf\u2019s commands or something, but I can\u2019t see what was offensive about her setting that boundary.", "That literally shouldn't even be required. \n\nWho tf is out here just wearing other people's stuff all willy nilly??\n\n\"They don't live in the country, I'm gonna do what I want with their stuff!\"\n\nLike is common decency just not a thing anymore? Plus. She didn't send them to a friend. She shipped it to her partner/spouse's place. \n\nMy sister lives 9 hours away from me, and I could have a package arrive at her house tomorrow if I wanted. SHE WOULDNT EVEN OPEN THE BOX WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST. THE FUCK????", "The fuck? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f OK I'm not going to keep arguing with you. You have your own opinions and I have mine. Have a good day.", "which wasn't included in the original, and completely changes the story, but doesn't change the fact that OP can talk to his partner about this like an adult instead of lashing out.", "Her moods are not your responsibility. She can be in a bad mood and if you don\u2019t like that kind of negative energy in your life, you are not forced to keep it. \n\nHowever, leaving relationships is hard, and it would be EASIER if she was easy going in the same exact way that you are, but she\u2019s not.", "Yeah no I added those extra details based on info from OPs comments, I wasn\u2019t just blindly assuming she constantly acts like that. I agree tho & hopefully he does have a serious convo with her and things either change or they separate because wow what a dumb argument", "I feel like it\u2019s also an issue of interpreting the texting.\n\nOP read: \ud83d\ude31Please don\u2019t wear my clothes. \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude21Thank you \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude44 I don\u2019t like when other people wear my clothes. \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2f\n\nGirlfriend meant: Please don\u2019t wear my clothes. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a I don\u2019t like when other people wear my clothes.\n\nSometimes if you just imagine the person saying the text, it shifts the tone in your brain and instead of thinking it\u2019s a negative thing, suddenly you realize it\u2019s actually fine. I have a feeling the girlfriend wrote a very neutral statement but it was interpreted as an attack.", "Did OP even ask? Lol\n\n\nSuper YTA", "Hi. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m a woman who wouldn\u2019t steal clothes from my boyfriend. I do, because he doesn\u2019t care, but if he did care, I wouldn\u2019t. Even as it is, by \u201csteal,\u201d I mostly actually mean \u201cask to borrow.\u201d\nYour fianc\u00e9e may not be an asshole overall, but it is indeed an asshole move to just keep dismissing your desire for her to not wear your clothes. It sucks that you\u2019ve apparently never dated a single woman who wouldn\u2019t do that. \ud83d\ude15", "Yes you should for sure get petty when someone tells you something they don't like. Just because your significant other is doing you a favor doesn't mean you become a mute doll. YTA.", "EXACTLY THIS!!!!", "If they\u2019re a stranger, no, of course not. \n\nIf they\u2019re also my romantic partner, then yes, absolutely!\n\nHard to imagine why I would share my life, home and body with someone, but not my clothes or food.", "Lol hell ya I can get delivery tax fries, unless asked specifically not to but then I might want something more for getting the food. We could have a whole discussion about it where we work something out. \n\nInstead of fighting OP just needed to discuss options with her like paying bag overage fees", "I\u2019m not saying her boundary was wrong but the words she used made it seem as if she was talking to her boss, or like he said a stranger, it was overly formal, while not necessarily rude if your partner talks to you like that you would prolly be weirded out because you\u2019re supposed to be comfortable with your partner", "Okay fair enough it was formal I\u2019ll give you that. \n\nBut like to immediately go all the way to \u201cwow you\u2019re difficult to deal with should we really even live together\u201d (paraphrasing of course) is kind of bonkers. That would send me for a loop if my partner said that to me for being a bit short but still polite while crossed. If she is anything like me she\u2019s probably being overly polite/formal because she\u2019s pissed enough that the alternative is to come across ass an angry asshole. \n\nObviously from OPs other comments they don\u2019t seem to be that compatible personality wise. So\u2026", "The words are literally in the text", "IMO she wasn't rude, just direct. People expect women to couch things in \"niceness\" and apologies, especially when they're expressing a boundary. When we don't, they often think we're being \"rude\" or \"aggressive.\" \n\n\nI think it's entirely fair for the gf to say \"please don't wear my clothes.\" He's the one doing something that could damage the clothes, why should she have to act like \"don't wear my clothes\" is asking him a favour? If OP gets offended and decides \"well f*ck you I'm not gonna bring any of your clothes to you if you're gonna be like that about it\" that's pretty immature and it's not healthy to be that vindictive towards someone you supposedly love.\n\n\n If OP has a problem with the whole arrangement of taking the deliveries and bringing them to the GF, he should say so and they can address it together, whether that means GF pays for an extra suitcase, or whatever they both agree on. Like adults.", "I still struggle to see how \"*Please* don't do x. *Thank you.* This is something that bothers me\" is considered rude and not patient.", "Ok but would you ever think you need to say \"also, please don't wear my clothes\" to your spouse?  \nPre-stating is great when you can anticipate what you're stating the preference about.", "I have to disagree with this as someone who buys men's pants.  My cargo shorts are going oh year 6, and they're just from old navy.  my REI camping pants are on their 4th year.\n\nI wonder if this is a garment care issue?  I am meticulous about how I wash/dry/store clothing.", "When I text my SO something that has both \"please\" and \"thank you\" (unless its literally \"please and thank you\" - that exact phrase, and only that) or goes unexpectedly formal, it means I'm either pissed or on the verge of a meltdown (autistic woman) and its honestly pretty passive aggressive. I'm working on it. But no, short sentences like that which are formal (not \"plz\", \"thanks!\", \"Thank you babe!\", etc) do not translate as being polite to me. They translate to \"you are fucking pissed about something. Let me give you time to cool down - approach with caution\"", "On the other hand, she ordered so many clothes that it takes up most of the suitcase, & did so without asking first.  That's a little off putting to me.. what should OP do if they don't have enough space for their own necessities?  Honestly I think they're both in the wrong here", "He should tell her not to have stuff delivered to his house anymore then. His boundary is not taking up all his space in his suitcase with someone else's clothes.", "I\u2019m not sure OP is a man. \n\nIf he is, most men are larger than their girlfriends, so a woman wearing her boyfriend\u2019s jacket wont stretch it out, but a man wearing his girlfriend\u2019s will.", "Good for you.

Because it's a big favour! Traveling with a guitar is a pain in the ass.", "Having them shipped/delivered to her own place instead of OPs in a different country would make more sense. Shipping can be cheaper than some airlines checked bag prices.", "Yeah but I mean there\u2019s a lot of stuff we don\u2019t know, and he said she\u2019s done this before, plus they\u2019re long distance which doesn\u2019t usually work out anyway", "70% of autistic woman don't know they are autistic don't even suspect it", "For some reason I really love your username", "Is that an emotional support \ud83e\udd9c?

They think saying please and thank you make it sound like a nice request when it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve definitely had people use that tone with me.\n\nOf course OP doesn\u2019t have a right to wear other peoples clothes, but at the same time I feel like when you don\u2019t know that\u2019s a boundary, going straight to that kind of tone is rude. And I feel like it\u2019s very normal for couples to play around each other\u2019s clothes. The boyfriend shirt fashion became a thing for a reason. But I feel like a more normal response for summer not knowing they were overstepping would\u2019ve been like: \u201c hey I don\u2019t really like it when you are my clothes, so can you not wear it on the planet ride?\u201d do you know what you could just be a think that a lot of people don\u2019t like people using their new things before them. I don\u2019t like it but I also wouldn\u2019t have use the tone she implied with her text. I probably would\u2019ve said \u201chey you know that\u2019s kind of new. I don\u2019t really like it that you\u2019re using something that\u2019s new that I never got to try.

That's just rude, mate... Come on, read between the lines...", "You should still say please and thank you to your SO, your family, anyone you have a bond with. They deserve politeness.", "Its not rude you are just insecure. If you want to be in a mature relationship you have to communicate which is what she did. YTA", "Insecure? She literally had clothes delivered to my house and ordered me to bring them to her. How is wearing her jacket that big a deal that she has to say this"]}
