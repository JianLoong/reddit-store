Its a risk that I\u2019d rather not take", " Important: Under no circumstances should the other end of the black cable be connected to the negative terminal, but rather to the body of the broken down vehicle. For this, a strong, unpainted metal component in the engine compartment of the vehicle, for example the engine block, is suitable. Connection directly to the negative terminal of the broken down vehicle is not recommended, as this can cause sparking, which can damage the battery. In the case of old lead-acid batteries, there may even be an escape of battery acid, which could endanger people in the vicinity. There is also a risk that hydrogen could ignite, so it is advisable to wear protective glasses.\n\n\nhttps://batteryworld.varta-automotive.com/en-gb/jump-start-car#:~:text=First%20the%20clamp%20of%20the,terminal%20of%20the%20assisting%20battery.", "Really? The guy who called me a bad mechanic is fine but when I respond asking for any source for their claim I\u2019m the one reacting badly?", "Is not recommended, that is correct. But, I think you severely overestimate the risks of an explosion. These aren\u2019t movie cars where a bump makes them explode. Yes, technically a spark could if ignite escaping gasses so you move the negative away from the battery.

She was trying to help him.

Is it defensiveness? You asked for a source, they provided one. Why would you risk it either way? Wtf point are you trying to make here?", "Well, you were connecting a dead battery and worried out the spark. You get the same spark installing a new battery....... mechanic lol", "I think you'll find that most mechanics wang 'er on the negative terminal and fire 'er up", "That's common here. People who have grudges against the OP tend to be very aggressive in their line of questioning interrogating until they find something to shit on them with", "Do you know what a jump start entails? You have to start the donor car to charge the battery on the dead car. That is a sparking risk directly on the battery if you attach it to the negative terminal rather than a metal ground bit away from the battery.\n\nChanging the battery doesn't involve such a sparking risk. \n\nNice job proving you have no idea what you are on about", "Grudges? It's not that, it's like they get off on questioning every little motive of the OP to rile OP up", "The \"help\" was dangerous bro reacted to what he saw could have been a deadly situation. Shouldn't have outright banned them but snapping in that moment is understandable considering the, at least, perceived danger", "Helping a mechanic jump his own car when he didn\u2019t ask for or need her help.

I have a 160amp alt on an agm that's also my starting and jumping battery, then I have a 320 amp alt charging a 128ah of lithium. Sounds like I may have a little more electrical experience huh....", "Those people are just people who are mad about OP being a \"big bad controlling man\" who are trying to make up facts to make him look like a bad mechanic.", "There is nothing deadly about hooking jumper cables up this way....", "And that proves your point about sparking when changing batteries how?", "Like I said, at least perceived. If you think something is dangerous would you just sit by and wait to see what happens?  He thought there was a real danger so he reacted accordingly, still disagree with the banning though", "You make zero sense. 12v is 12v, and a 12v spark is a 12v spark. There is nothing deadly nor dangerous unless you are an idiot and reverse the cables. By your logic, my truck should have blown up when I was running a 3 battery bank. I mean, I had 3 batteries, all positive to positive and negative to negative, and nothing ever blew up. Of course, their were sparks when placing the fuses because that's what happens when a live circuit is complete."]}
