OP, think hard about this relationship if she has an alcohol problem.\n\nWhy does someone being drunk make them **A** drunk? I know plenty of people (myself included) who've had a few too many from time to time but that doesn't make them an alcoholic.", "You sounds adorable.  :-D", "Have you considered, the amount of things you've never seen but still happen every day?", "It seldom happens, but it can (and is impressive when it does).  Similar to many other directions made to prevent a possible bad outcome, just because it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean the directions aren't there for a good reason.", "So when you connect batteries in a circuit it tries to equalize the voltage but there is a differential voltage between them if one is really dead (14v to like 10v).\n\nThis causes heat to build up in one or both batteries very quickly due to a few factors I'm not 100% on and can absolutely cause damage or an explosion. That's why you connect one to ground so that the differential is neutralized.", "It can damage the CPU at most\n\nIt does not damage the battery at all", "INFO: How will it avoid sparking?  (I'm not being facetious, I honestly want to know.)", "I too have always connected positive to positive and negative to negative and never had a problem.", "All good mate, thanks for commenting", "Read modern jumper cable instructions: terminal is the suggested location, and has been for years.", "Victim is a strong word in this context.", "Was the only other option violence?", "He can take them from her hands lmaooo if she\u2019s that drunk I doubt she has a very strong grip", "Imo everyone who pays attention in high school knows a few things about batteries. I understand OP didn't want a drunk person mess with his car - who would? Also, I don't exactly blame him for yelling but he still has no right to make rules about his gf's car and he does have some pretty weird hangups.\n\nI do think he is NTA but I'm like 99% sure I couldn't stand him irl. People have a hard time separating the two (myself included).", "I want you to know that I've decided this is the best comment, ever.", "And everyone who pays attention to biology knows how to make a baby. Does that mean anyone opinions is equal to an OBGYN ?", "Ahh, better to take a risk rather than offend some drunken chick who thinks she knows everything. /s", "It\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be done. When you\u2019ve got a perfectly sober mechanic there trying to fix the car, why would you risk something that isn\u2019t recommended? Especially on a car that isn\u2019t your own. \nDoesn\u2019t really matter if OP overestimated the risk. The point is that there was a risk, and OP took steps to avoid the risk. Then some random person comes along trying to tell a mechanic how to do his job, and attempts a risky manoeuvre.. it\u2019s not unfair for OP to stop said random person. It\u2019s not their car, and even if they could get the job done with the risk, it\u2019s OP\u2019s prerogative to not take such risks. \n\nBet you wouldn\u2019t be arguing this if an explosion did occur because of what the friend did. \ud83d\ude12", "He gave you a source. Good Lord. \n\nHow about you post a video of yourself hooking up jumper cables the same way the drunk chick wanted to and get back to us.", "Who cares if it\u2019s not a literal explosion? It could still do damage to the car that will be expensive to fix. It wouldn\u2019t be like a little dent.", "I think there's a tad bit of difference between the complexity of a common car battery and human biology.", "That's cause they are on a fishing expedition. The OP is a guy and by unspoken aita rules you must go fishing in this scenario to justify some inane reason for calling them an AH else you are not doing it right in this subreddit.", "At the end he is a specialist and even if the risk isn't huge, it's still exist so maybe people who are not mechanic shouldn't be talking to him as if he is an idiot especially since he brought the proof of what he was saying. \n\nBut I have others : does anyone who has done a cake is qualify to be smart ass towards a pastry chef ?", "Any and all insane reaches in logic are fair game. \n\nI bet if OP says that he is a mechanic and doesn't recommend driving in the rain with bald tyres someone who wants to dunk on OP for being a man will try and claim that bald tyres are fine", "Not where I work. Dunno about others", "She was DRUNK. He didn\u2019t need her help. She could have damaged his car. She grabbed the cables out of his hand. \n\nReverse the genders and see how it looks.", "Jesus... I said I understood OP and his reactions. I wouldn't let drunk people mess with my car either no matter their education.\n\nI still think most people understand how a battery works because basic education covers it. I don't have to be a mechanic to know how to start up a car with a dead battery. Been there, done that, more than once, with more than one method.", "I've worked with and visited many professional mechanics and amateur/hobby mechanics and I've never seen anyone connect the negative to the battery. I never really knew why until today, but I was always told to put it on unpainted metal and not the battery and I never really questioned it. Even in the more sketchy shops I've seen them put it on unpainted metal. These people are full of shit lol.", "Been there done that too, yet he is the specialist so I'm going to listen to what he says.", "I\u2019ve had a woman who graduated with honors argue with me for ten straight minutes because her battery was dead and she refused to understand that. \n\n\u201cCars don\u2019t have batteries they run on gas.\u201d \n\nThis woman was in her mid 20\u2019s. You SEVERELY overestimate the intelligence of the average citizen."]}
