So I and best friend (who we will call Kate) along with 30 other applied for the position. there is a limited number of spots, 14 in total and I got one of the top position while Kate got an email to state she was rejected from the work programme. Now Kate has done nothing but talk about how she got the job to friends and family while telling them I had little chance as I didn't have \"friends in the right places\" so to say she was gutted when she got the email was an understatement, she called HR to rage to them about it and said they made a mistake and that they had to fix it at once as she demanded that she be but on to the first flight available. While I went out for dinner with my Bf to celebrate the good news. at this point I didn't have Kate told I was going, only my Bf and my father knew about it. \n\nSo Kate came over to talk to me and I knew it was about her not getting the position, while she was over she was so mad at the HR telling her she wasn't suited for the program. Kate then went on to talk about how I didn't get the job so she didn't feel as bad, it was in the moment I turned to Kate and told her I got the position and I was just waiting to start the process for my visa. Kates anger turned in to pure utter rage when I told her this. she began to scream and throw things at me which included a mug of fresh tea. After she started to calm down she began begging and crying asking me to turn down the position so that she could go instead of me. Kate then went on a rant of how she deserved it more then I did and it wasn't right for someone like me to go when it was rightfully hers.\n\nKate has gotten her family involved in the situation telling them I am the reason she can't go cause I took her spot and that I am being selfish and that I haven't put in enough work this year to get this. she has also started to tell people I slept with my manager to get a good recommendation from him for this position. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nso would I be the asshole for taking this job?", "created_utc": 1685804843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zflza/wibta_for_taking_a_job_that_my_best_friend_wanted/", "score": 1073, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stay above and keep your hands clean. Let Kate sink her own ship.", "well its going to be easier to ignore her half way across the world.", "I think me moving half way across the world for 6 months is gonna make it easier for me. but as of right now we are not on speaking terms", "I am going. it doesn't matter what she says or do. I got the job for a reason. people in the comments have helped me see that and I'm so thankful. cause I felt like an asshole for wanting the job", "I am heading to New South Wales. I have been told it gets very hot during the season", "thank you so much!!!!!!!! <3", "well I do understand where HR is coming from, they can't just believe what everyone tells them with out proof. so now that I have people going in with proof they can do something about her", "I'm astounded she's still employed, given how she behaved just towards the company after she was not selected.\n\nNTA.  Enjoy Australia!!", "At least you told them. Create a paper trail if you can. Let them know if she does something else. Cover your six because nothing is too low for Kate and you'll want people to know not to trust her word over yours.\n\nI hope this is all my paranoia and you won't actually need it, but safe is better than sorry.", "Yeah she\u2019s creating a toxic work environment. You\u2019ve done all the right things now go to Australia with a clear conscious.", "You should thank Kate for creating the perfect situation to make you want to put thousands of miles between the two of you! \ud83d\ude02", "Yep NSW can get hot - but its won't be as bad as North Queensland (Cairns). \n\nAfter a year or two you will get used to the heat - and be wary of the sun.", "I feel it might be just enough distance\ud83e\udd23", "My best friend and I both applied for the same job, I got it, she didn\u2019t, we are still best friends 5 years later \n\nThe way she\u2019s acting is not best friend material \n\nGo to Australia, it\u2019ll be amazing and you\u2019ll make plenty new friends", "Here\u2019s a theory: She was hired as a favor to someone high-up in the company, but was never considered particularly qualified. As such, she was never even seriously considered for the Australia job. \n\nI base this on nothing but my observations of behavior I\u2019ve seen from other individuals who got their jobs through \u201cconnections.\u201d At this point, the person who got her in either doesn\u2019t know what has happened or she\u2019s lied to them about it. They\u2019re going to hear about the scenes she\u2019s making and quickly move to disavow their sponsorship.", "NTA. Don't make career decisions based on  what friends want, period. Also, she was told she was not qualified, she would not get the position even if you were to step down. She got the job in the first place because of connections, not qualifications.

Go to Australia.  Kate is not your friend.", "NTA\n\nI suspect her blowing up to HR because she didn\u2019t get the job, explains why she was found to be \u201cunsuitable\u201d. I suspect that even if you now turned it down, she would not get the vacant place.\n\nI know it will mean that you have lost a friend, but a true friend would have congratulated you.\n\nA friend I knew who worked for a different local authority, and I, both applied for the same position as Deputy head of section. We aren\u2019t aware that we were in competition until the day of the interview - for me it would have been an internal promotion. We both found it hilarious. He was successful, and I ended up reporting to him. \n\n2 years later, I was head of a Department elsewhere, he had left to start his own business in the same area and I was able to give him the contract for our outsourced work.", "NYA and you need to report her to HR immediately as she is trying to get you fired by spreading roomers.", "NTA but she is a toxic AH and definitely not a friend. You need to go to management and relay to them the harassment and lies she is telling.  Enjoy your new position and go NC with Kate and anyone else who is badmouthing you", "NTA Kate is being an entitled jerk, she is NOT acting as your friend. Do not set yourself on fire to keep her warm.\nEdit: Maybe you should send her a gentle, civilised email or text stating that you are sorry she feels hurt about not getting the job. With any luck she will either smarten up, or send you a response that will be sufficient for HR to act on.", "NTA - she sure doesn't sound like your friend. She sounds like she tests you like garbage. Take the job and find better people to be around. Friends should build you up and celebrate your successes", "NTA, Kate is the asshole. It\u2019s one thing to be bitter and jealous and upset, it\u2019s a whole other thing to *throw things at you* including a mug of tea that could burn you and seriously injure you. We do not accept this energy from \u201cfriends\u201d.\n\nI almost went into your field and instead ended up in a very small, equally competitive animal related field. There have been many occasions when my friends and acquaintances have applied for the same positions that I have. It can be really difficult to compete with the people you love and even harder to resist the urge to be jealous and be happy for them when you feel you\u2019re being left behind. But that\u2019s part of being an adult. \n\nIf Kate continues this aggressive behavior I would be saying something to management. It\u2019s not your fault she wasn\u2019t given the position, especially when there were 14 spots. It\u2019s not like you beat her out of the only opening, there were 13 other people that were also a better fit. Where\u2019s her resentment towards them? Also, pretty bold of her to assume they would choose her if you dropped out of the program. Sounds like they know a little bit about her behavior and she wasn\u2019t chosen for a reason. \n\nYou have to be done with Kate. This person is not your friend and judging by the way she talked about you to others, she never really was. Block her on everything, stay professional, and make your move to Australia babe.

Enjoy and prosper!", "First of all CONGRATULATIONS!  You have EARNED that job though your hard work. Kate is entitled and enabled. You have been more than kind and generous to someone who is acting like an unhinged backstabbed.  I\u2019m glad HR is involved. Who knows what she might do. Don\u2019t walk down any flights of stairs in front of her. You are NTA, NOT AT ALL.", "Omg NTA. This girl is an absolute brat who thinks just because she knows people she deserves a job. You are clearly qualified and even if you gave up your spot I doubt it will go to her. Congratulations on the job and I hope you have a great time in Australia. You'll make plenty of new friends who don't tear you down as you succeed", "Why are you friends with this girl? Your post does not list a single good quality for er- she comes off as selfish, spoiled, petty and vindictive.\n\nI would let your manager and hr know immediately about the rumors she is trying to start.

She\u2019s an entitled brat", "NTA\u2026.if you back out, how does Kate  know she will get that spot?  There were other applicants.

You are going to love it. \n\nYou would be crazy to not take the job both for the job and the 7500 or so miles that you would put between yourself and Kate. It doesn't appear that you and she were actually in contention for the same positions so, if you were to decline the offer, Kate would not get it anyway. \n\nKate sounds a bit unstable. Ok, a lot unstable. After taking her entitled ass to HR and raging at them about not being selected, does she really think that they would even consider her even if a position that she was qualified for opened up? \n\nOne las thing, I am sorry that you are losing a friend. It does sound like it was a little bit of a lopsided relationship however.", "Nta. I would keep an eye on her, she sounds desperate and may go even further to sabotage you.  Send HR proof of her harassing you.\nBTW, congratulations on the promotion! Sounds like a great opportunity for you!", "NTA. HR told her that she wasn\u2019t a good fit for the position. She throws a fit and then blames you. I think her mental instability and lack of self control is the reason. She is not your friend. She is in competition with you.", "YTA for living through that and then typing it all out thinking it\u2019s even a remote possibility that you are the a-hole\n\nYou will be an even bigger a-hole if you don\u2019t do everything in your power to never speak to her again and if you don\u2019t report her to your employer immediately", "NTA but your \"friend\" sure the he'll is. Go enjoy your time in Australia. Watch out for those redbacks.", "NTA... as the HR says, she isn't suited for that job... or any job if she feel so entitled to a position and throw a temper tantrum when things don't go her way, also throwing you dangerous objects and tarnishing your image is vile... I hope you consider your friendship done with this childwoman.\n\nEdit: Typos and grammar mistakes.\nEnglish is not my first language.", "NTA.\n\nI'd like to clarify that she is NOT your best friend. Under no circumstances does someone you're close to have that kind of reaction if they care about you. Whatever the last 8 years have been for her are not the same for you. She's liked having you around because in her mind she's better than you and that feeds her power complex.\n\nHave fun in Australia!!", "NTA - her behavior is definately the reason she didnt get the job and on top of it with all that she did screaming at HR etc im surprised she isnt fired yet.  you go and take this job u deserve it by having earned it.", "First of all, this is not how a \"best friend\" acts (talking about her, not you, to be clear.)  She sounds like a horrible friend, and that is before she THREW A FRESH CUP OF TEA AT YOU. I honestly don't see how you would want anything to do with her going forward. Take the job, leave her behind, and move on with your life and career. \n\nYWNBTA.", "YWNBTA and I'm sorry to say that Kate is not your friend, 'best' or otherwise.\n\nNo need to be too cut up about it though: you're about to leave her sorry ass in the dust for a new life in Australia.\n\nThere'll be dust there too, but it'll be friendly dust.", "NTA Kate is...unhinged to say the least. And who knows, if you turn down the job, she might not even be offered it instead? It could go to someone more stable.", "NTA.\n\nIt is sad that this happened but you cannot put your life on hold just because you friends wants you to.\n\nIt is just one of the situations where you have to weight in what you want, what you stand to lose and gain and whether you will be able to live with the choice comfortably.", "NTA \n\nKate is not, nor has ever been, your friend. Take the job, enjoy your life, forget about Kate.", "NTA. The only asshole here is the entitled woman you're foolish to consider a friend.\n\nHer connections got her into the company but her entitlement kept her from the new job.\n\nThe audacity to think if you stepped out it would mean she could go. It means she's good enough for the entry-level job but you've proven your worth to the company and they see that you have what it takes to grow with them.\n\nDon't you dare step down for Miss Uncongeniality. She has shown you what a spoiled brat she is; you're probably one of few who didn't realize how horrid she is.\n\nYour friendship is over so no need to consider her; anyone who throws things at you is not a friend, nor would a friend demand you not take a promotion on their behalf.\n\nLittle Miss won't get an opportunity like that after going to HR and making threats. They're quite right to exclude her.", "NTA. She is a bi*ch. Take the job and take lots of pictures while there. Then post the pictures and tag her in them.", "This is not your BF\u2026", "NTA. Take the job and file a complaint with HR.", "NTA. Take the job you deserve it. Kate. Is. Not. Your. Friend. So stop calling her that.", "NTA. Stand back and watch her get fired. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll take too long. Kate sounds like an embarrassment and it\u2019s only a matter of time before it affects the business.", "NTA you have to take it because you need to get as far away from Kate as possible. But seriously, if you did not take the job, she would not then get it.", "NTA\n\nKate is unhinged and not a real friend. She\u2019s selfish as hell. Don\u2019t back down and catch the next flight to Australia", "She threw a mug of fresh tea at you. I'm assuming it was hot. She can go stick it and her massive ego where the sun don't shine.", "Hmm I wonder why she didn't get the position. Yelling at HR, making demands, spreading rumors that could cost a lot of people a lot of trouble. All because she didn't get the promotion after she was hired as a favor to someone.\n\nNext time she goes off on you, ask her if she would hire and pro ote someone that makes demands, threats, goes off on coworkers etc. And when she inevitably laughs and says no, then ask well why do you expect to be hired when you wouldn't hire yourself?\n\nNTA", "NTA\nShe threw tea at you?  This is going to be one of those friendships that do not make the long haul.  Have fun in Australia and forget about this girl", "NTA! Buh\\~bye Kate. I have been on hiring committees. Sounds like you earned the position, and K surely telegraphed her character during the application and interview process. Go and succeed.", "NTA - Take the job and ditch Kate from your life for good, she isn't your friend", "NTA. Go to HR *right* now and tell them how she raged at you. Threw things at you, had her family harass you. They didn't pick her probably because of her attitude.", "An added benefit of the move is that you get to be half a planet away from Kate.

NTA", "That's how the world works. People don't get every job they want. Of *course* you shouldn't turn it down to appease her. It's not like there's a guarantee she'd even get it if you did.", "The main reason I didn\u2019t tell people I applied was I didn\u2019t want no one to know if I didn\u2019t get the job, Kate had everyone told she had the job cause of her connections and made it seem like that\u2019s what you need to get a job in there. But I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t reply on someone else. I made a name for myself (in a good way) now and people know who I am and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of myself.", "She got the job from her fathers friend who had some pull in the company. And she was working well last year but as of this year she kinda pulled back a bit as if she has enough already. She kept telling people how her connections were going to get her an easier job. But the job for Australia was harder then what we are doing.", "Kate is in with HR on Monday to discuss her future with the company, so Kate is going to have fun with that.", "I only recently told all my friends as Kate told all of them and each and everyone of them were happy for me.

I understand that she may be feeling left behind but I would always have done my best to make sure she in the loop of everything. This job can be very competitive as you want to work to the best of your ability daily and constantly throughout the season. Working hard in this job is what give you huge advantages and opportunities. But I feel after all is said and done if she was given a spot she wouldn\u2019t take it out of spite.

But as a friend said we have both never been going for stuff that could change our careers and futures. So maybe she was feeling left behind. It\u2019s not like she will talk about it anyway so I\u2019ll never know.", "That\u2019s the part she doesn\u2019t want to understand.

There is zero chance they'll call her back now either way.", "Um. Since you're asking if you're the AH or would be... your 'friend' literally threw a mug of (presumably) hot tea at you and is telling people you slept with your boss to get a job she wanted and wasn't qualified for, in addition to calling HR and hassling them.\n\nNTA, but you really, really need to reconsider this friendship because all of this is horrific behavior on her part.", "Even if she would have gotten it if you rejected it, it\u2019s unlikely that would still be the case after her behavior from the initial rejection. If I worked in HR and had you reject the position I definitely wouldn\u2019t be offering it to the person who threw a tantrum over their initial rejection. Her behavior doesn\u2019t indicate that she would be able to keep her cool through situations or work well with others when there are disagreements. Even if you went back and rejected it now she definitely wouldn\u2019t be considered as the next person to offer the position to.\n\nShe is taking her frustration out on you and that\u2019s unkind and unfair. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this, it\u2019s okay for her to be upset, but her behavior is not okay. It\u2019s also incredibly condescending that she assumed you wouldn\u2019t get the job and that she was pretty much shit talking you until she realized that you got the job, and now she\u2019s acting like you don\u2019t deserve it. You clearly do well at work and earned your spot, she\u2019s just too self absorbed and looks down on you. I\u2019d reconsider the friendship if I were you, you don\u2019t deserve friends who will talk down to you and about you. You deserve friends who will be supportive, kind, and happy for you.\n\nCongrats on the new job!! It sounds exciting and like a great opportunity!", "She threw tea at you. She thinks she\u2019s better than you and is really vocal about it. She belittles you.\n\nGo to Australia, have an amazing experience and cut Kate out of your life. Nobody needs \u201cfriends\u201d like her.\n\nOh, and tell your bosses and Hr.

So, likely she was happy to be friends as long as you were *her* backup, but shes not interested in supporting *you*.\n\nShe isnt your friend.

If she was that willing to throw you under the bus **and maim you** like that for a *job*, then I'd be concerned of what she has said behind your back for the past 8 years.

I very much doubt she\u2019s number 15 on the list and would be the next called up if something happened. I also don\u2019t think she\u2019d cope overseas without having mummy and daddy to take up her fights and bail her out.

I hope you have an amazing time!", "I certainly believe you, but regardless of how she was feeling, everything you described about her reaction even before you told her you got the job doesn't sound like something a friend would do. Honestly, it doesn't sound like something an acquaintance would do. \n\nI'm a teacher, and let's say for the sake of discussion a colleague and I were both applying to replace our supervisor if they left. If I found out I didn't get the job, I wouldn't think for a second about going to talk to my colleague and saying \"well, it's not that bad because you didn't get the job either.\" And if I found out they got the job, I would be disappointed, but I would at the very least pretend to be happy for them.

It\u2019s pretty great here and you\u2019ll make lots of new friends who value hard work over connections!\n\nIt sounds like your friend isn\u2019t a great cultural fit for Australia anyway, if she\u2019s the type to brag about friends in high places and being more worthy than others. Aussies would laugh her right out of the HR department and then the town \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Ditch this \"friend\".", "NTA and I think you need to go to HR and tell them what she's saying. That's totally unnacceptable. She was counting on getting in NOT on her own merit, and you did, and even if you did step down, she wouldn't get it. Congratulations, but report her. Document it all.", "NTA", "YWNBTA. On behalf of everyone in Australia, we don't want your friend here. \n\nEmbrace this opportunity and make the most of it. Your friend wouldn't last 5 minutes on a stud over here with that attitude anyway.", "Kate sounds like a fucking nightmare, NTA. Go and be far away from this insufferable asshole.\n\nI\u2019d honestly be looking for a lawyer to send her a cease and desist over the slander. Talk to HR as well.", "Don\u2019t do this. Humility and grace will take you further. It\u2019s fun to talk about being petty over drinks with the friends, but it\u2019s rarely advantageous to be it.", "Honestly just ghost her. She is -NOT- safe. Stop talking to her/ go very low contact & block her when you\u2019re out of the country. She does not deserve any formal goodbyes from you. She clearly loathes you. She\u2019s entitled, spoiled, & unhinged. She won\u2019t listen to anything you have to say about the situation. Keep yourself safe & protect your peace. \n\nHave fun in Australia!", "It would have been comedy gold if she came to Australia. Australian's love to cut people back down to size. I think I'd buy tickets to that show.\n\nI hope you have a wonderful time.", "OP doesn\u2019t say she\u2019s in the states", "I agree as well, she is creating a hostile work environment and needs to be dealt with ASAP. I recently had to stop talking to a \u201cfriend\u201d of mine due to her ignorance of being privileged and believing anyone (including I) that didn\u2019t travel like she did (she\u2019s in her early 20\u2019s) around Europe or the world was \u201cuncultured\u201d\n\nBest decision I\u2019ve made in awhile mentally and emotionally", "Consider asking that friend or any others for possible evidence they can provide. I can imagine Kate is currently going through a slander campaign to turn anyone against you. If she tries to approach you again be ready to secretly record any interaction with her. Or maybe even have your boyfriend text her to incite some of those slanderous claims again.", "She doesn\u2019t realize that having gotten the job through nepotism she\u2019s probably one of the least qualified people. She didn\u2019t earn her original job, she was just born to people who knew people. Also the idea of her suing the company is laughable. If they have studs of 2 continents (I suspect actually three of more) then they have more money than she can imagine. Racehorses cost money. Buying retired racehorses to stand at stud costs lots of money. Maintaining the animals and the property- even more money!", "I doubt whichever country OP is from particularly wants to keep Kate either"]}
