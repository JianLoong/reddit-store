Now Kate has done nothing but talk about how she got the job to friends and family while telling them I had little chance as I didn't have \"friends in the right places\" so to say she was gutted when she got the email was an understatement, she called HR to rage to them about it and said they made a mistake and that they had to fix it at once as she demanded that she be but on to the first flight available. While I went out for dinner with my Bf to celebrate the good news. at this point I didn't have Kate told I was going, only my Bf and my father knew about it. \n\nSo Kate came over to talk to me and I knew it was about her not getting the position, while she was over she was so mad at the HR telling her she wasn't suited for the program. Kate then went on to talk about how I didn't get the job so she didn't feel as bad, it was in the moment I turned to Kate and told her I got the position and I was just waiting to start the process for my visa. Kates anger turned in to pure utter rage when I told her this. she began to scream and throw things at me which included a mug of fresh tea. After she started to calm down she began begging and crying asking me to turn down the position so that she could go instead of me. Kate then went on a rant of how she deserved it more then I did and it wasn't right for someone like me to go when it was rightfully hers.\n\nKate has gotten her family involved in the situation telling them I am the reason she can't go cause I took her spot and that I am being selfish and that I haven't put in enough work this year to get this. she has also started to tell people I slept with my manager to get a good recommendation from him for this position. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nso would I be the asshole for taking this job?", "created_utc": 1685804843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zflza/wibta_for_taking_a_job_that_my_best_friend_wanted/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

F sake! \n\nGlad you\u2019ve got good people in your life not willing to allow a brat to through a tantrum! I hope this gets sorted for you soon. Enjoy Australia!", "I am lucky enough not to work in the same section of the company as Kate so we only see each other when we planned to meet up. HR has been told and they have said they will need to see it in writing or hear come out her mouth before they can take serious actions", "she has a meeting with HR on Monday so  we can only hope that something is done as I have people who have proof of all these things she has said going in to HR as well.", "I have people who Kate told these things to going to speak with the HR on Monday for me. they said it wasn't right and that they want to see something done about this cause it isn't fair on me or my manager.", "NO. Stay above and keep your hands clean. Let Kate sink her own ship.", "well its going to be easier to ignore her half way across the world.", "I think me moving half way across the world for 6 months is gonna make it easier for me. but as of right now we are not on speaking terms", "I am going. it doesn't matter what she says or do. I got the job for a reason. people in the comments have helped me see that and I'm so thankful. cause I felt like an asshole for wanting the job", "I am heading to New South Wales. I have been told it gets very hot during the season", "thank you so much!!!!!!!! <3", "well I do understand where HR is coming from, they can't just believe what everyone tells them with out proof. so now that I have people going in with proof they can do something about her", "I'm astounded she's still employed, given how she behaved just towards the company after she was not selected.\n\nNTA.  Enjoy Australia!!", "At least you told them. Create a paper trail if you can. Let them know if she does something else. Cover your six because nothing is too low for Kate and you'll want people to know not to trust her word over yours.\n\nI hope this is all my paranoia and you won't actually need it, but safe is better than sorry.", "Yeah she\u2019s creating a toxic work environment. You\u2019ve done ask the right things now go to Australia with a clear conscious.", "You should thank Kate for creating the perfect situation to make you want to put thousands of miles between the two of you! \ud83d\ude02", "Yep NSW can get hot - but its won't be as bad as North Queensland (Cairns). \n\nAfter a year or two you will get used to the heat - and be wary of the sun.", "I feel it might be just enough distance\ud83e\udd23"]}
