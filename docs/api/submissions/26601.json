You wanting clarification makes sense, but she also has the right to think: *No sh\\*t, Sherlock*; she is right to feel that your question was condescending.\n\nThe thing that you should think about is that your wife was expressing that she was behind schedule when you checked in with her. The best thing you could have done was ask if it would help her by picking up the groceries and bringing your other kid's swimming needs to help her speed things up.", "NTA it's valid to ask.\n\nI didn't hear your conversation, BUT the way you wrote it could come off as condescending and since this seems to be a somewhat reoccurring thing, maybe you should think about how you word things.
