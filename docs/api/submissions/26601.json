Does he keep track of if his wife has taken a swimsuit with her or not?\n\nReddit is basically shit. Everyone is assuming that he's using some sort of talking down to her or patronizing tone to justify calling this guy TA, but that's just their bias to immediately jump in front of any truck aimed at a female. \n\nThis is just basic relationship level stuff, everyone does this - I get this a lot from my own wife and I just respond with some sarcasm and call it a day. Wife needs to cool her head because if someone is anxious like OP, their way of speaking is going to always be driven this way. That's why my wife does it - she's a naturally anxious person and that anxiety often ends up flowing out of her mouth in the form of dumb questions.", "I'm not bot, just a neuro divergent individual with electrical engineering degrees and the stereotypical personality to go with them. Then again maybe I am a robot.\n\nAlso, I went back and read the thing again and see that I misunderstood or skipped something but I'm in a similar relationship with me being the logical creature and my wife being the emotional one and we go to a counselor and basically after 10 years of being told how I do everything wrong and I don't speak correctly and whatever it turns out that she ascribes emotion to things she should not ascribe  emotion to. There's also that thing about being a mind reader.\n\nIf you call me from the grocery store and you tell me you're going to the lake house with friends, I'm going to be really confused why you aren't bringing the groceries home first especially after you tell me to not put food out for you. That's all kinds of red flags, but assuming is never a good idea and so I'm not going to assume you're going to bring the groceries home especially if I need them.", "Sure did read that and the fact that she\u2019s AWARE of how SHE is and she is making no effort to work on her temper leads me to believe she\u2019s manipulating him.\n\nInstead of working on her temper she\u2019s throwing it off on him and accusing him of being condescending. There\u2019s a lot of finger pointing at each other and no one is fixing their issues.", "She asked him to stop and he also asked her to stop getting angry it\u2019s disrespectful she didn\u2019t stop and he doesn\u2019t have to stop it\u2019s his natural way of talking. Maybe he needs the assurance that she\u2019ll bring it home even if it might be a given to her. Like mums that ask stupid questions because they\u2019re worried. Maybe he\u2019s like that and he finds it disrespectful the way she answers", "This isn\u2019t an English exam. Even if he knew it\u2019s not 100% given she wasn\u2019t gonna do it ,he could still ask it in that way maybe that\u2019s just the way he asks his questions no need for her to cry about it", "He's also blaming her for causing the issue. It's 'her temper' not him being a jackass.", "Yeah 100% my ADHD self would ask that with the thought process of \"kid doesn't need food, so naturally that means she/wife aren't coming home. But wait, the groceries?\"", "True. I just know I say dumb stuff like this sometimes because my brain goes stupid on me. I actually thought as I read it, \u201cIs she not going to bring the groceries home first?\u201d It was the way it was phrased. But if I said that to my husband, he would tease me about thinking he was that irresponsible, I would admit it was a dumb thing to say, it would end with us laughing, and neither of us would remember it with annoyance later. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d as one of a frequent list of complaints if it ends with laughing. Does that make sense?", "Exactly, if my husband said this I\u2019d be like \u2018nah I\u2019m gonna dump them in the lake\u2019 and we\u2019d both laugh\u2026but he doesn\u2019t make a habit of speaking to me like I\u2019m dumber than a box of rocks, and it sound like OP does.", "This is exactly the dumbass type of thing I\u2019d say without thinking and then realize how idiotic I sound. \ud83d\udc80", "Well, then there is the risk of some things freezing.", "That\u2019s one of the few things I miss about living in upstate New York during grad school. I would work all day, run to the grocery store, go to a three hour class, and then take my groceries home. It was terrible weather otherwise, but damn if it wasn\u2019t convenient once a week.", "Sure if you're a professional victim you could take it as insulting, but she could have behaved like an adult and realized she changed plans on him last minute and her sudden change of plan may have caused him confusion, especially when preoccupied with a child, causing him to ask a stupid question. \n\nYou'll say we'll she's asked him not to talk to her like that before. That's doesn't matter because because as I said she could be a professional victim and just takes offense in anything he says. To me it doesn't seem like this guy is an asshole but more of a pushover. Wife is the asshole.", "She changed plans on him last minute, maybe he was confused and asked a stupid question. She's a professional victim and an asshole", "Who are you responding to? I said I am more polite to a pet than OP was to his spouse. I don't have a wife. I value my family immensely. And I am not OP.", "Can you kindly explain how it\u2019s disrespectful to ask a question ?", "yikes, i hope you get the help you so desperately need.", "And if it's this much of a problem, then maybe he needs to change the way he asks questions instead of crying about it.\n\nThis is another flavor of \"that's just the way I am.\" The way you are is no excuse if the way you are is an asshole.", "Husband in the streets, wife in the sheets", "My husband says stupid shit like this occassionally, it's a brain hiccup and he owns it immediately. OP is just an ass.", "You\u2019re reaching \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f If you\u2019re okay with your significant other always being condescending then good for you but most people aren\u2019t and it doesn\u2019t make them a \u201cprofessional victim\u201d if they get upset about it. She\u2019s probably behaved like an adult repeatedly and asked him to stop but he hasn\u2019t which led to her reaction. Does he seriously think his wife is stupid enough to just leave groceries in her car all afternoon?? It doesn\u2019t matter if she changed plans or not. How does changing plans lead him to think that she would do something that stupid?? Maybe he should think before he speaks since this has been an ongoing problem.", "Seems like you\u2019re working really hard to make this her fault. He admits she\u2019s asked him not to ask her questions that make it sound like he thinks she\u2019s an idiot, then describes himself doing exactly that. Your reaction is \u2018well provably she\u2019s just over sensitive and making it up all the time\u2019. . .even though there\u2019s a concrete example right here.", "When she divorces him over the dishes, just know it\u2019s *wasn\u2019t about the dishes*", "Because she\u2019s told him multiple times this kind of things bothers her.\n\nWhen you tell your partner that something bothers you and they continue to do it anyway, it\u2019s disrespectful.

You are a hypocrite and more than likely a professional victim just like this asshole lady.", "Not at all, I'm making an assumption just like you people are.... you are doing the exact same thing I am.....", "I'll know it's because she's an asshole", "So if your partner tells you multiple times questions bother them. Would you stop asking questions all together. When it\u2019s an unreasonable request, ofc he\u2019s not gonna follow it. That\u2019s the way he is and if she can\u2019t accept it she can F off. He also finds it disrespectful that\u2019s she\u2019s getting angry at such a small thing so she should stop throwing tantrums over nothing", "Ik she didn\u2019t ask that but I\u2019m saying stupid requests for him to stop asking questions in a particular way which is natural to him", "Yeah okay bud the only \u201cassumption\u201d I made was that she acted like an adult in the past when asking him not to say condescending shit and I came to that conclusion based on the fact that he never once said she reacted like this in the past. If she had a history of this he would\u2019ve said that. So yeah anyone with common sense would come to the same conclusion. You on the other hand pulled \u201cprofessional victim\u201d out of thin air and have nothing to base that claim on. That doesn\u2019t even fit this scenario considering everyone agrees he was condescending and they would be mad too.

That\u2019s the same card that narcissists and abusers use to justify their behavior and refusal to be a better person: \u201cthat\u2019s just who I am so deal with it.\u201d\n\nYou should be able to communicate open with your partner.

That\u2019s his own fault. He is 100% responsible for this. \n\nShe\u2019s angry because he was disrespectful. She\u2019s angry that he doesn\u2019t listen to hear, or take her feelings into account.
