If an 11yo is old enough to have a phone then they\u2019re assumed old enough to be responsible with said device. She knew what she was doing and now there are consequences for her actions", "NTA\n\nGotta love natural consequences! You're their aunt, not their parent. If your sister hasn't made sure the 11yr old understands the responsibility of having the phone, that is on her.", "NTA. Her daughter is 11. That's more than old enough to understand the consequences of deliberately destroying something.", " NTA. Her kid broke her own phone. Now she has to reap the consequences.", "INFO: are you being paid to babysit?", "YTA but you don't need to buy a new phone. You are an AH tho because you should have stopped the younger kids from tormenting Skye. You should talk to sky and apologize to her and commit to her that next time you are watching her, if the younger ones start to torment her, they will be punished or put in time out. \n\n> says I could've stopped it from getting broken but didn't.\n\nI agree. You could have stopped it. All you needed to do was stand up for Skye. \n\nWhy have a baby sitter if its just going to be Lord of the Flies while you're there?", "INFO: are you getting paid for all this labor you \u201chave to\u201d do?", "I do wonder if it was at all helpful to try to \u201ccalm her\u201d when OP could have tried to get the boys to stop. The kid acted irrationally because she was cornered. OP sat back and let it play out. I still say they\u2019re not responsible for paying for a new one but damn, why were those kids not actually ever put in time out? Why was that an empty threat?", "NTA\n\n\n>an 11 year old is old enough to have consequences to her actions.\n\nNo just that an 11 yo its not old enough to have a phone! Any socialmedia \"allow\" kids under 12/13", "Best comment :)", "I came here to say the exact same thing. Let her figure out and pay for a new babysitter. The child is old enough to face consequences of her own actions. It is not OP fault. I would stop helping all together if this is how I was being treated. Some people need to understand you don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you.", "Yes, because she had no help. It was literally her only way to end the torment. No adult was helping her at all. Since it was her only way of ending the torment (or the only thing her 11 year old brain could think of), can we actually judge that she was wrong to do it?", "OP did nothing to deescalate the situation. They threatened a time out and never followed through. When Skye got upset about being pestered she was told to calm down. In her kid mind she had no other options.", "Scrolled down way too far for this. OP threatened time outs for the boys and did nothing but sit back and watch and try to \u201ccalm down\u201d the girl who was being harassed. Why was the time out an empty threat? Why did OP let it escalate to that point? That kid probably saw no other out since OP did nothing to help her.", "Not OPs kids", "If you don't mind me asking, what is the relevance of her being paid or not?", "Na I disagree especially if OP didn't want to babysit. I'm a younger siblings so when I was forced to I kept them feed safe and alive. I tried to keep them respectful of each other and all that responsible things. But if they were annoying each other I'd tell them to stop. Short of picking them up and moving them I couldn't do anything.", "As a parent, I'd say OP has to do better than that....BUT she's their 19yr old aunt. Sounds like sister needs to direct her anger at the kid who threw it.", "Is she getting paid for all this forced childcare? Is it really her problem that these children haven't been raised better?", "OP said she did try to get the boys to stop.  My rule of thumb is if kids can't stop fighting over an item, I take it away and hold on to it.  End of fight.  Might be a good strategy for OP.in the future.", "Op thought it was funny, did nothing. that makes them culpable. YTA", "You can have a cellphone without having social media \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I lied about my age to Neopets back in the day. Makes sense kids today would lie to Tiktok.", "I had a phone at 10. Why? Because I started going to sleepovers and the skating rink with friends and my parents wanted a way to keep in touch with me just like I wanted to be able to easily talk to my friends. \nHaving a phone \u2260 having social media, so why would the appropriate age of having a phone have anything to do with when social media sites say you\u2019re old enough to join?", "Because theoretically, if op is getting paid, an arguement could be made that she is partially responsible, as its her job to monitor and control the children and she didnt do it well. If op is doing their sister a favour, they are absolutely not responsible, because you get what you pay for.", "So because you were  bad babysitter is okay if other people are too?", "How is it forced childcare?   I didn't read anything abt coercion , kids being dumped at her doorstop, etc.", "Please quote the section of the post that communicates this information.", "OP didn't think it was funny; the brothers thought it was funny.", "I know, but you think a kid will be out?", "Yes, you can but SM is a trend and the \"popular\" kids have SM and it's a big way of communication. I(17f) have never been a fan of SM besides Tik Tok and Discord. She is 11, and she wants to be cool around her friends and have Snap and/or Insta.", "I know, i lied to, to play when i was a kid, thats why i know we all do", "At 10 when your parents gived you the phone, you will be doing what the ops nice did?\n\nAre kids and kids! Its there the parent need to be ready (idk how to say in english but listos o poner atencion)", "I see, respectfully I disagree but our opinions are our own.", "I wasn't a bad babysitter I just never got physical with the kids. If the daughter didn't have anger issues she could have gone to a different room and locked the other kids out, while OP talked to the kids.", "Yep, and I  say this as a parent of a child that is old enough for a cellphone, but not old enough for social media.", "I said theoretically. I personally wouldnt find op responsible, but it would make her sisters viewpoint more understandable.", "Yes! X2 not parent but an aunt how act like the other who its not present, i make sure know what they are looking", "That's fair enough. I won't argue with your theory. I personally just don't see it making sense, and that is just me personally. If you and others understand the point of view, that's great."]}
