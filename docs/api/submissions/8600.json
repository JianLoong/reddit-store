She\u2019s already using you for not having to spend money for babysitting, she can kicks rocks about this.", "NTA. If she\u2019s old enough to have her own phone, she\u2019s old enough to take responsibility for breaking it WHEN SHE DID.", "NTA - It's 100% up to your sister to pay for the consequences of her daughter's actions. It's not on you at all. You're not the parent. You're the much younger, not-too-experienced aunt. You did the best you could.", "OP is 19. Pretty sure she doesn\u2019t have money to replace a phone. I don\u2019t think she should because obviously the 11 yo isn\u2019t responsible enough to have one. What responsible person throws a phone out of a window? You say she did it because she was cornered. That just means she lacks emotional maturity to take care of anything of high value and, as such, it\u2019s just going to be a waste to get another phone. Bring the Nokias back and get this kid one so she can\u2019t destroy it.", "OP is 19 watching 3 children\u2026. This is insane. She is not responsible. If 30F wants professional care then she should look for a professional.", "When kids are going at it you're often trying to put out both sides of the fire at once. \"You, stop yelling.  You, leave her alone.\" \"You, come to me if you're having a problem. We don't hit. And you, give them back their toy.\"\n\nThis is 0% the aunt's fault.  Mom knows it. She's just frustrated and out a phone", "YTA for not considering she may be a single SAHM through no fault of her own. My husband died leaving me to raise 4 special needs children by myself on disability. If I hadn't had family that had my back we would have never been able to make it.\nFor the record, though, I agree that OP should not replace a deliberately destroyed phone.", "If she\u2019s old enough to have the phone, she\u2019s old enough to have the responsibilities of the phone, NTA", "The fact that kids were fighting or made a bad choice doesn't mean they're being raised badly.  It's not OPs fault, but regular kids make dumb decisions.", "Nope.", "Nope, you are NTA. Your niece is old enough to understand that actions have consequences. Unfortunately your sister doesn\u2019t realize that either.", "Get her a Nokia from 2001\u2026.there you replaced it. NTA", "NTA.\n\n1. You never have to babysit. That\u2019s not something your sister is owed, especially if she\u2019s not paying you. Free labor is never owed to anyone. \n2. Your niece decided to break her possession to spite her brothers. Now none of them can play games on it. Niece got what she wanted. \n3. If your sister wants to replace Skye\u2019s phone, then it should be Skye\u2019s financial responsibility to do neighborhood chores to earn enough to replace what she broke. If Skye doesn\u2019t want to replace her phone, that\u2019s up to her.", "Nta. Old enough for the item, old enough for the responsibility.", "NTA...should not have to pay to replace", "NTA - this is what happens when give kids expensive technology and they are old enough to understand the consequences of their own actions. All 3 kids should be helping pay for the phone through chores and such since they all had a part in it getting broken", "NTA.  And since you\u2019re such a terrible babysitter, I\u2019d end that as well.", "Esh. The CAUSE of the problem was the two boys being pains, and then your nieces over-reaction. But you played a role - Why didn\u2019t you shut the boys down, send them away from your niece.\n\nTell sister that if they (the boys and your niece) each do  ~8 hours of chores (mow your or her lawn, load the dishwasher\u2026) you will pay.", "Nope. How in the ever-loving-hell were you to stop her child from breaking their phone?\n\nSounds like no more babysitting for you. Aww shucks.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is why you don't give expensive electronics to children. Her daughter broke her own phone.", "NTA", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if the kid is two years old or 20 you still wouldn\u2019t be liable for the damage. The mother decided to get a kid a phone When that\u2019s a risk of them breaking it and 11 years old is more than old enough to know not to break their own stuff.", "YTA if you were in charge, you should have handled the situation way before it got to an 11yo throwing the phone out of the window. I think that you should go halves given that this was a deliberate act on your niece\u2019s part rather than an accident.", "NTA, and my guess is that this isn\u2019t the first time the younger sibling have pestered the older one for the phone.  I\u2019m also going to guess that normally the mom makes some half hearted attempt to redirect, and then when they keep at it makes the older sibling \u201cshare\u201d the phone  \n\nUnless the 11 year old is just seriously spoiled, this isn\u2019t a normal reaction to the situation, this is how someone who is at the end of their rope reacts\u2014she seems like shes so sick of dealing with their pestering that she\u2019d rather just not have the device at all.  My guess is that this is just going to keep happening until the younger sibling have devices of their own.  And, personally, I don\u2019t think kids that young should be getting \u201cscreen time\u201d for games without parental supervision and strict time limits, and there certainly shouldn\u2019t be tolerance for begging/nagging/whining/pestering once someone has said no. 11 is old enough to know better than to smash a phone, but 5 and 6 are also plenty old enough to know that no means no, not keep asking me incessantly until I give in. \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling guilty about it, you could offer to buy a cheap flip phone so that the 11 year old still has a way to contact home if needed, but by no means are you responsible for replacing a smart phone.", "NTA. Who buys an 11 year old an expensive phone in the first place?", "NTA, it\u2019s clearly the child\u2019s tantrum that caused it - she needs to learn from it, not be rewarded with a new phone.", "Stopp babysitting. They are her kids, her problem. NTA", "NTA yeah not your fault.", "NTA an 11 y.o. shouldn\u2019t even have a phone imo, especially if they aren\u2019t responsible enough to not throw it out of a two-story window. i don\u2019t think the phone should be replaced in general, let alone by you.", "NTA - even if OP was 30 she would be NTA.  11 year old has learned a valuable lesson of why you keep your anger in check, older sister has now learned she has been failing as a parent because 11 YO should know better than to throw expensive things and break them and expect them to be replaced.  If niece want's a new phone she needs to show she is willing to work for it... and work for it she should.", "IDK this one is hard to me. She was the one babysitting and is responsible for what happens to the kids but she probably never thought she would actually break it. I don't understand why this kids weren't put on time out or why if you couldn't get the situation under control you didn't just take the phone and put it up until your sister got home.", "NTA, someone is trying to scam you to getting an upgrade", "NTA. But, OP, I would text your sister, \"Since you feel I should be responsible for all your children's actions when doing you a favor, I've decided that I can no longer babysit them. Hopefully, you can find another sitter who will be more to your liking.\"\n\nOP, you're doing her a favor and she's this entitled. Just stop helping her.", ">This is far more on your sister's head. She got an eleven year old with poor impulse control an expensive phone.\n\nAnd 5 and 6 year old rotten brats who gang up on the 11yo. \n\nFTFY", "I agree with this take. That\u2019s why I think that OP should at least pay for half of the phone. How difficult would it have been to redirect the boys, tell them to stop bothering their sister or for OP to temporarily take the phone for safe keeping?", "I expect 5 and 6 year olds to act like little demons.  I don't expect an eleven year old to fling her phone out of a window over it.  What an odd thing to \"fix\" for me.", "> Yes, because she had no help. It was literally her only way to end the torment. No adult was helping her at all. Since it was her only way of ending the torment (or the only thing her 11 year old brain could think of), can we actually judge that she was wrong to do it?\n\nYes we can. Her siblings are 5/6 years old incessantly asking her to borrow her phone, which I\u2019m sure was annoying but describing it as torment is a bit much. 11 years olds should definitely know better than to throw their phone out a window because a kid half their age is bugging them.", "This is what I want to know!  If not she should tell her sister (who decided to have multiple children she can't take care of) that obviously OP can no longer baby sit.", "My parents did this, my brother learned that he wins either way. I learned I was not worth any time or effort on their part. No justice, no fairness, no value. Bro learned there were no consequences. He wanted something of mine, either I HAD to give it to him to keep the peace, or they would take it from me. Either way, I lose.", "What i *meant*, is that the 5 and 6 year old should have been taught how to behave right along **with** the 11yo. (Age appropriate teaching, of course.) So that she wouldn't have gotten to that breaking point to start with. We can *all* do really really stupid things if we're pushed hard enough!\n\nETA: on a second reading of your comment, I think we pretty much agree. Sister needs to parent ALL of her children better!", "Because she's 11 and under stress. Shit, just being 11 is enough to make rash decisions. She doesnt get any peace with the phone there for them to bug her about, get rid of the phone and they wont hassle her, but they also dont get what they want over her.", "This is true, absolutely!\n\nIt's just that they are blaming a baby sitter for the childs behavior.", "NTA", "Nta she is definitely old enough to know better", "NTA She has children who misbehave. She is more than welcome to find a better babysitter if she so chooses. Let her fire you for not doing a better job. I am sure you can find something better to do, and probably find a job that pays more and is less stressful.", "Nta", "NTA do not pay for the phone.", "NTA, she broke her own phone", "NTA. You tried. It\u2019s your nieces fault for breaking it. Your nephews also need to be punished for not backing off. At 6 and 5 they know that stop means stop. All of the kids, though, are at a stage of development where the consequences for their actions aren\u2019t clear to them. You do not need to pay for the phone.", "Stop right here. You babysit for her and she Blames you for this? Stop babysitting girl. Your sis is ungrateful. NTA", "NTA\n\n11 year olds don't need phones anyway.", "Nta there's no reason why you need to replace the phone. Her daughter is old enough to understand that you shouldn't break stuff on purpose.", "That's a good strategy for you to not have to parent, it's a terrible one if you care about your kids. All you are teaching your children is they can't come to you if they need help. That will stick with them when other things come up that don't inbolve their siblings."]}
