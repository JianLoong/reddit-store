She has really bad anxiety and smokes to help with it. She has tried a lot of different medications and is in therapy, but it has not be helpful for her. She started smoking about a month ago after her friend suggested it. It has helped her. She is a lot more calm. I have 0 problem with her doing this. I\u2019m glad that it has been helpful for her. \n\nHere is where the problem comes in. I have my own apartment and sometimes my girlfriend stays over. I don\u2019t like for her to smoke in my apartment because it gives me migraines and I have pets and I don\u2019t want them around it. I have no issue if she goes outside to smoke and then comes back in when she\u2019s done. She\u2019s been fine with this until yesterday. Yesterday when she came over it was raining really bad. She didn\u2019t want to go outside to smoke (understandable) and was asking if she could just do it inside this one time. I told her no. She knows the reasons I don\u2019t want her to. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t drive, so I offered to drive her home so that she could (she lives 5 minutes away from me), but she said she wanted to stay with me. I told her I didn\u2019t really know what to do because I don\u2019t want it in my apartment. She ended up agreeing to go home. The rest of the night she didn\u2019t talk to me. I texted and called her several times and she ignored them. I know that she was on her phone because I saw that she was posting on Twitter. \n\nThis morning I woke up to a whole bunch of messages from her friend, her mom, and her sisters calling me terrible names and saying that I want my girlfriend to suffer and that I was being abusive for not letting her smoke to help her anxiety. I feel really bad. I don\u2019t want her to be anxious, but I also don\u2019t want it in my apartment. I really love her and I don\u2019t want her to think I don\u2019t care about her anxiety, because I do. I just feel sick whenever I\u2019m around smoke. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t specify but she is smoking weed. I\u2019m sorry if I worded it wrong. I don\u2019t really know the right words to use when talking about it.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the advice. My girlfriend answered me and I\u2019m going to go get her so that we can talk.", "created_utc": 1675173813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pzus9/aita_for_not_wanting_my_girlfriend_to_smoke_in_my/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps she should think of a less obnoxious way of getting the drug that she needs in to her system.", "NTA you even offered to drive her home so she could. Did she go home and trash talk you to all her friends and family? Because that's fucked. Anxiety doesn't give her the right to be a dick.", ">I woke up to a whole bunch of messages from her friend, her mom, and her sisters calling me terrible names and saying that I want my girlfriend to suffer and that I was being abusive for not letting her smoke to help her anxiety\n\nQuick tip: if you have a reasonable boundary and someone does this to you when trying to violate it, it's a colossal red flag.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd maybe cut your losses if she's unwilling to be reasonable here. Most non-smokers don't want the stench of smoke in their homes.", "NTA\n\nSmokers smoke in the rain. Your girlfriend made the decision to start smoking a month ago, I don't know what she was thinking but she needs to get with the program. In this day and age, smokers smoke in the rain.\n\nEdit: Even (especially) when they're in relationships or in households with non-smokers.", "NTA - \n\nFirst of all, setting the boundary of not smoking in your apartment due to your migraines/pets is 100% reasonable. She knew you had this boundary, she knew it was raining, and she came over anyway. The whole argument could have been avoided if she had respected your boundaries and took responsibility for her own needs by smoking before going to your place. So why didn't she just smoke before leaving her own home? Probably because she is hoping to slowly chip away at this boundary with \"special circumstances\" like bad weather until you let her smoke at your place whenever she wants. \n\nSecond, her setting her flying monkeys after you over a disagreement is immature and a major red flag. The argument itself I could chalk up to a bad day and a bit of selfishness on her part. But involving her friends/family to the point that they are attacking you takes it to another level. I would be seriously questioning the relationship if my partner pulled that on me\n\nThis whole situation screams that she doesn't respect you or the boundaries you want to set. She is willing to manipulate and bully you to get what she wants. It also speaks to a level of immaturity and unwillingness/inability to work things through with you as a partner.", "Definitely NTA. The last paragraph gives me the creeps, sorry that happened to you.", "NTA. Passive smoking (inhaling the air from a Smoking person next to You) can damage you quite heavily. Also you are responsible for your pets and their health. You explained it to her often/more than once so she knew about it. Also you offered to drive her home. \nIn my opinion You did nothing wrong. You didn't forbid it totally but you offered a solution she accepted in the end.", "I have anxiety and your girlfriend sounds like a brat, she's making a shitty excuse for a nicotine addiction she's self inducing.\n\nYou're NTA, I smoke and even I don't like what smoking indoors does, it's bad for the house and everyone inside of it. Her demanding to smoke indoors is inconsiderate of your health.", "NTA. She can find a covered area outside to smoke or use an umbrella. I\u2019m a heavy smoker and would never disrespect someone\u2019s home by insisting on smoking inside. I don\u2019t even regularly smoke inside my own.", "NTA and she really should not have picked up such a toxic habit to deal with anxiety. This is so unhealthy. For everyone. There are so many other things she could try. \n\nAlso, most rentals do not allow smoking inside. Check your lease agreement and I am sure you will see a clause in there about it. It\u2019s a pain in the ass to try to get smoke smell out of walls. Yuck. \n\nDoes she have an exercise routine? Can she focus on a hobby? Start a mediation practice? Does she have a balanced diet? How are her sleep habits? \n\nOne of the first things a practitioner will tell someone with uncontrolled anxiety is to cut the caffeine, limit alcohol consumption, stop smoking, and eat a balanced diet. \n\nNo one should be encouraging this habit. You should not feel bad. She needs to find another coping mechanism to deal with her anxiety that does not hurt her health or potentially yours.", "NTA not her place she needs to respect your boundary.", "NTA.  Sooo nta.  I don't get the attitude of smokers who seem to think people should just accommodate their habit that has been scientifically proven to adversely affect health?  It's the most selfish behavior in my opinion.  You gave her option...she could go outside or go home.  She chose to make you feel like sh*t instead.  This is not a good long term relationship.", "NTA the second someone brings in people to gang up on you it's a sign that it is time to get out.", "NTA\n\nYour boundary for keeping your place smoke free is reasonable. Your girlfriend is unreasonable for expecting you to bend the rules for her, especially since she knew the reason behind the boundary. Having her friends and family go after you for enforcing your boundary is also unreasonable.\n\nYour girlfriend just threw up so many red flags that I think you should really consider whether or not it\u2019s wise to be in a relationship with her.", "NTA: From an exsmoker whose then boyfriend was not a smoker: Common courtesy dictates you smoke outside, away from the windows. I used to go out onto the balcony but his roommate's bedroom was right there and it bothered him. So I went into the parking lot. If it was raining I used an umbrella.", "NTA but I'm going to be honest with you. Smoking pot does not help with anxiety, it puts a Band-Aid on those feelings for a little bit but they will come back in full force. Therapy and medication is a long road but they can result in real progress while smoking doesn't actually fix anything.\n\nTake a cold hard look at her and her parents behavior and ask yourself is this healthy and is it worth it?", "Hell no. NTA. Anxiety is not an excuse to smoke in your home.", "NTA. The smell of smoke is strong as hell. It also gives you migraines.", "NTA\n\nShe needed the smoke so badly that you took her home.  She couldn't ignore her habit for the evening, and you have a hard rule against it where you live.\n\nYou mentioned your pets and your migraines, but there is also getting that smell everywhere.   There is also not getting your security deposit back if your complex doesn't allow smoking in it.\n\nNo one smokes in any house or apartment I've had in my name.  That smell permeates furniture, the walls and ceilings, the carpet, and your clothes.  F that.  Even I, who enjoy the occasional cigar, take that shit outside my home and keep the ashtray outside.  If it rains or is stupid hot/cold, no cigar for me.\n\n\" I was being abusive for not letting her smoke to help her anxiety\"\n\nUtter bullshit.  She could go out in the rain to smoke.  She could take an umbrella.  She had options.  Die on this hill, OP.", "NTA.  She can stand outside and smoke like everyone else.", "NTA. Your expectations are reasonable.", "NTA I smoked my whole life until last year when I had to quit due to health reasons. Yes, my lungs are shot thanks to smoking. I would not recommend anyone start smoking. Please suggest she stop before she is addicted. See a doctor for anxiety. So PSA aside, I have not smoked inside my house for over a decade. Reasons are it smells and it sticks on everything. Over time a film will develop on everything. It's yellow and sticky. Your clothing will reek of cigarettes. I do have a covered porch and it does suck to smoke outside in the dead of winter, but it keeps my house clean. If you have cats I would not recommend subjecting them to the second hand smoke.", "if she has to leave your apartment and she cannot stand not smoking for a few hours they can really indicate that she\u2019s developing a dependency on it and smoking too much.\n\nIf you smoke too much too often it makes your anxiety worse. I was smoking daily and frequently and it caused me to have the worst panic attack of my life. You can develop a dependency on it to the point where you cannot manage your anxiety at all unless you\u2019re high.\n\nDoctors can prescribe THC but they\u2019re going to be prescribing her a specific dosage. I really think that using marijuana add medication for anxiety really needs to be done under supervision of a medical health care professional. \n\nShe is not a doctor she should be seeing one to help her anxiety because perhaps they would prescribe a completely different treatment plan.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your boundaries are sensible, and she ought to respect them. The fact that she tried to get you to bend the rules and then presumably went home and trash talked you to her friends and family when you wouldn't budge is ridiculous. Not letting her smoke in your apartment is not abusive, and her friends and family need to buzz off.", "NTA. Time to leave the girlfriend. She\u2019s being manipulative and the minute you stood your ground about a totally reasonable request/boundary (you probably will lose money on your apartment if someone smokes in it, btw) she runs to all her friends and relatives to get them to harass you. Smoking is a habit that lends itself to being very inconsiderate. It stinks, it\u2019s bad for your health, and it permanently damages property and your health and that of anyone around you. \n\nThis girl is not worth it. She\u2019s shown she has no real care for you, your health, and your things if there\u2019s a conflict with what she selfishly wants. She CAN smoke in the rain. She didn\u2019t want to.

What kind of a jerk thinks it's okay to just light up *inside* someone else's home? And then gaslights you into thinking that you're being abusive for saying no? You might love her, but she is not treating you like she loves you.", "NTA. This is a new habit for her and you have every right to not allow it in your house. But her getting friends and family involved in this is pretty alarming. She's 25, she's not respecting your boundary and she's getting others to bother you about it (and calling you abusive???). I assume you're talking about weed, but research is mixed on whether it helps with anxiety (high-THC products have been found to make anxiety worse in some studies). She could consider gummies if she wants a smokeless alternative. But I'd be wary of someone who wants to bend a rule like this in someone else's home, especially when it causes the homeowner to have migraines.", "Woah woah, NTA.\n\nI smoke too sometimes to just get a break from my anxiety. I would never ever dream of doing it inside someone else's home. I don't even smoke inside my apartment, lol. \n\nIt stinks, is not good for pets, and you don't smoke.

It\u2019s your home, you get to decide what takes place in it. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation, clearly, but that doesn\u2019t really change this particular point.

It sounds like she has a lot more maturing to do.", "NTA, \nYour house your rules.\nAlso, her smoking is casing you medical issues (her not smoking is causing her medical issues that probably need a doctor to review) and you shouldn\u2019t have to put up with that.", "NTA! I also smoke partly for the same reason partly because I enjoy it. I'm not allowed to smoke it in anyone else's home other than 1 friend. Everyone is OK with me taking it outside, and I have NEVER asked otherwise. If it's raining, well then too bad. Deal with it, or don't smoke for a bit until it calms down.

Cigarettes or pot? If its pot, is it legal where you are? Have you checked your lease? Sometimes there a no smoking policy because it definately is something that can affect other residents. When i smoked in our apartment, the WHOLE building knew and the hallway STUNK. \n\nIm a smoker but my hubby and i go either to the garage, outside or downstairs with an air purifier on high. Smoke sticks to EVERYTHING. clothes, pet hair, eventually it can absolutely leave residue on the walls.

I'd talk with her about that", "NTA. \n\nBesides, smoking actually makes anxiety worse. It\u2019s the withdrawals that makes the anxiety come back, and then you smoke more to resolve the feeling, and so on. She should quit for multiple reasons.

Your girlfriend should respect your boundaries within your space and the way she behaved when you told her no is actually a pretty big red flag.

She needs to get a vape pen then, smoking flower indoors is basically the same issues for someone who doesn't want it.
