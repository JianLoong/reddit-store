{"id": 16614, "submission_id": "13at3be", "title": "AITA for blocking my in laws?", "selftext": "My husband and I have 3 kids and one on the way. I ran in to severe complications and I'm on full bed rest/need surgical procedures done to save myself/baby. I've had 3 treatments and they were so expensive (partially covered by insurance) that we needed to reach out for help. I only have one treatment left before baby is here (scheduled C-section at 36 weeks) and we don't even have a portion of the cost to cover it (1200). Again, we reached out to his and my family for help and wouldn't have done so if we had any other option. Not a single person helped. I've had my help page up for 3 weeks and had 3 donations- from my friends. \n\nMy SILs dog however was just taken to the emergency vet with hind leg issues. The dog needs a procedure done (for $2900) to get her leg fixed and then will need PT afterwards, and she has stated in her help page that she will need help covering PT cost as well but has no estimate on cost as of currently. Within 8 hours they raised $2150 and when you go through the donations, it's ALL family (husband's). From the same people who said to us \"Sorry hunny, we wish we could help\". So basically, a dogs hind leg is more important to these people than a surgery needed to save a baby. And I guess it was even more of a hit because of the fact that my husband and I are ALWAYS the people that they run to for help whenever they need anything (moving, rides, groceries, event planning, etc). \n\nI didn't even speak to my husband about it first because I was so hurt but I went on and blocked all of them on social media, on my phone and from my eldest daughters phone. This was last week. I have since told my husband that they were all dead to me. He just held me and said he understands. Well, my MIL just got a hold of my husband and asked why she couldn't contact me and said she wanted to ask me how I was. He told her why and stated that I wanted nothing to do with them and that he was on my side. She flipped and told everyone and people have been blowing up my husband saying that they can't believe I am \"selfish enough to make comparisons\" and that they dogs surgery was an emergency and where I'm so close to the due date, they feel my surgery is unnecessary and I shouldn't expect people to help when it's not a definite that something will go wrong, like it was with the dog. AITA?\n\nETA: details on surgery and procedures: at 23 weeks they found tearing near the placenta and I have had to have several shots in my stomach to prevent me from going in to early labor (I've started going in to early labor 4 times since). The tear in the placenta has been causing multiple traveling blood clots and the procedures I've had to get done are to remove the blood clots so they don't travel to my heart. I've been put on several meds to try and prevent clotting but it's not that effective because I'm drug resistant due to other medical issues that I've had since birth. The dogs surgery is correct a mobility issue, as she is losing mobility in her back leg. They called it something specific, though I can't remember the name. I want to say \"drop foot\" but I could be wrong. It's not life threatening. It's a \"quality of life\" procedure.\n\nETA again: we were completely well off prior to this. I don't care to hear some mumbo jumbo of \"don't have kids you can't afford\". I stated we were good prior to this. We were able to pay for all the procedures out of pocket prior to the last one needed. And for those saying the quoted statement above- I could say the same about the dog. Don't have a dog if you can't afford one. As I said, I've had 3 procedures paid for out of our pocket. My SIL can't even get a partial first payment for the first procedure for her dog but has 6 kids of her own.", "created_utc": 1683472654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13at3be/aita_for_blocking_my_in_laws/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
