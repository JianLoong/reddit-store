{"id": 16614, "submission_id": "13at3be", "title": "AITA for blocking my in laws?", "selftext": "My husband and I have 3 kids and one on the way. I ran in to severe complications and I'm on full bed rest/need surgical procedures done to save myself/baby. I've had 3 treatments and they were so expensive (partially covered by insurance) that we needed to reach out for help. I only have one treatment left before baby is here (scheduled C-section at 36 weeks) and we don't even have a portion of the cost to cover it (1200). Again, we reached out to his and my family for help and wouldn't have done so if we had any other option. Not a single person helped. I've had my help page up for 3 weeks and had 3 donations- from my friends. \n\nMy SILs dog however was just taken to the emergency vet with hind leg issues. The dog needs a procedure done (for $2900) to get her leg fixed and then will need PT afterwards, and she has stated in her help page that she will need help covering PT cost as well but has no estimate on cost as of currently. Within 8 hours they raised $2150 and when you go through the donations, it's ALL family (husband's). From the same people who said to us \"Sorry hunny, we wish we could help\". So basically, a dogs hind leg is more important to these people than a surgery needed to save a baby. And I guess it was even more of a hit because of the fact that my husband and I are ALWAYS the people that they run to for help whenever they need anything (moving, rides, groceries, event planning, etc). \n\nI didn't even speak to my husband about it first because I was so hurt but I went on and blocked all of them on social media, on my phone and from my eldest daughters phone. This was last week. I have since told my husband that they were all dead to me. He just held me and said he understands. Well, my MIL just got a hold of my husband and asked why she couldn't contact me and said she wanted to ask me how I was. He told her why and stated that I wanted nothing to do with them and that he was on my side. She flipped and told everyone and people have been blowing up my husband saying that they can't believe I am \"selfish enough to make comparisons\" and that they dogs surgery was an emergency and where I'm so close to the due date, they feel my surgery is unnecessary and I shouldn't expect people to help when it's not a definite that something will go wrong, like it was with the dog. AITA?\n\nETA: details on surgery and procedures: at 23 weeks they found tearing near the placenta and I have had to have several shots in my stomach to prevent me from going in to early labor (I've started going in to early labor 4 times since). The tear in the placenta has been causing multiple traveling blood clots and the procedures I've had to get done are to remove the blood clots so they don't travel to my heart. I've been put on several meds to try and prevent clotting but it's not that effective because I'm drug resistant due to other medical issues that I've had since birth. The dogs surgery is correct a mobility issue, as she is losing mobility in her back leg. They called it something specific, though I can't remember the name. I want to say \"drop foot\" but I could be wrong. It's not life threatening. It's a \"quality of life\" procedure.", "created_utc": 1683472654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13at3be/aita_for_blocking_my_in_laws/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is definitely not a smart cookie.\n\nAt this point they will be very lucky to even be able to see their grandchildren anymore.\n\nNTA\n\nYeah and also stop helping people who don't deserve.

They literally had more than twice what you were asking that they could spend on desperate family members in serious medical conditions and told you to fuck yourself.\n\nKeep them blocked and I wish you all the best with your pregnancy.", "NTA... its their money and they can decide how to spend their money.  Then fast forward 18 years and the family is lamenting why they have no relationship with their grandkid/cousin/niece/nephew, years after the dog died of natural causes.  Choices have consequences.", "NTA- one of the most appalling things I've read here. \nDon't let them flip the situation. They're horrible people. \nGood luck with everything!", "NTA.

Also, where did they get a degree, and the right to tell you better than your doctors what surgery is or isn't unnecessary? \n\nThey say you find out who your real friends are when you are struggling, or are in need. Seems like you just saw with your own two eyes what happens when you have a struggle around these people. Can't say I blame you for blocking them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
