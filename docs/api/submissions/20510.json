She has been on a strict diet to look her best for our wedding. I understand that she wants to feel confident and beautiful and I fully support her decision to make positive changes to her lifestyle. However, things have started to get a little tense between us and I'm not sure if I'm to blame.\n\nShe has been getting increasingly upset whenever I eat normally around her. She's expressed that it's difficult for her to resist temptation when she sees me enjoying desserts or indulging in treats. I've tried to be understanding and accommodating, but I also believe that I shouldn't have to alter my eating habits completely just because she's on a diet. I work a very physical job and have an active lifestyle. I've never had the most healthy eating habits but because of how active I am it's never been a problem for me.\n\nTonight was the breaking point. On my way home, I stopped by Chick-fil-A, which happens to be one of my fianc\u00e9e's favorite fast food places. I thought I'd surprise her with a treat since she's been doing so good on her diet. When I got home and told her, she absolutely exploded. She called me selfish and unsupportive, saying that I was intentionally trying to sabotage her progress.\n\nI never meant to hurt her and I genuinely thought I was doing something nice by bringing home her favorite food. But now I'm questioning whether I've been insensitive throughout this whole process. Should I have refrained from eating certain things around her even if they're not part of her diet? Am I really the selfish one here?", "created_utc": 1687663690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ibmnc/aita_for_bringing_a_treat_for_my_fianc\u00e9e_who_is/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Diet culture sucks. 1) You totally should be able to eat whatever you want and not be beholden to your partner's low calorie choices- this is basic bodily autonomy. 2) It sounds like your fiancee has \"an all or nothing\" approach to the diet and I don't think you're an AH for not knowing that. (aside: Dieting in that way is actually ineffective for achieving long-term weight loss). 3) It also is sad that your fiancee is trying so hard to lose weight that it is leading to conflict between you both, and I imagine she feels pretty crappy moment to moment.", "ESH.  She can't expect everyone to abstain from eating things she won't eat.  But bringing her favorite forbidden food as \"a treat?\"  That's a dick move.  You know she's trying to abstain, and you decide that she needs a treat?  That seems an awful lot like sabotage.", "YTA. Regardless of whether her diet makes sense or you agree with her need to lose weight or whatever, you need to respect her wishes. Her wishes are not to be tempted by foods that will derail her goals. \n\nIt's not fair of her to ask or demand you to hide your own food choices from her, but it would be considerate of you to try not to flaunt your snacks that you know are temptations for her. A big part of long term relationships is respecting each other's boundaries and being considerate of these small things.\n\nIf you go by Freud, we have the \"id\" (the selfish toddler that just wants to indulge itself constantly) the \"ego\" and the \"superego\" (the conscience and the self control to do things in our long term best interest). You knew her \"id\" would like the Chick Fil-A but you need to focus on appealing to her superego. I have the same issue with my husband who does all the grocery shopping, and buys me snacks to make me happy. Except I'm trying to eat healthier and it's a lot harder to make good choices when I know that those snacks and treats are sitting in the pantry. I understand his impulse because he wants to provide for me, but he has to learn to respect my desire to eat healthier (we're making progress slowly).", "Next time, just ask\n\nAs for this weight loss or health journey, join her. \nI would get upset too, if in trying to better myself and the people around me know it, yet they bring something home for me that doesnt help. At this point she could also practice discipline but it would be more helpful if you join along side her. Diets should not be restrictive though, otherwise one may binge.", ">She's expressed that it's difficult for her to resist temptation when she sees me enjoying desserts or indulging in treats.\n\nNo, your fiance can't make everyone adjust to her diet because she can't control herself.\n\n>I thought I'd surprise her with a treat since she's been doing so good on her diet.\n\nIf you know she doesn't want to be tempted why would you buy her tempting food?\n\nESH, but more so your fiance for shaming your way of eating. You're an asshole for trying to get her to cheat on her diet though I understand there were good intentions.", "Why would you reward her with the very thing she's trying to avoid? That's like saying, hey, you're doing great with your drug rehab! Have some drugs to celebrate! YTA", "It sounds like maybe you are trying to sabotage her progress? She's told you explicitly that she's struggling to stay in her diet and your response is to bring her something she doesn't want to eat? YTA.", "ESH - you\u2019re intentions were okay so I wouldn\u2019t say AH. But understanding that weight loss for others can be a battle is kind of key. \n\nIf she isn\u2019t imposing on you and you can avoid tempting her by not eating right in front of her, it\u2019s not more than an ordinary marital compromise.\n\nNo reason to not support her. Once she forms a healthy habit, it\u2019ll be easier for her to not be tempted.", "YTA - this sounds like you are intentionally trying to sabotage her diet.", "YTA \n\nYou shouldn't have brought that fast food home, especially since she's been telling you not to tempt her. Aside from that, if you want to be considerate then eat your junk food when you're out instead of at home. Honestly, you might give healthy eating a go, at least at home, like healthy snacks and fruit etc.", "YTA. Why does the reward for her progress have to be food? Why couldn't you get her a book she's been wanting or flowers or basically anything else?", "NTA I feel like your finance doesn\u2019t actually understand basic nutrition. You don\u2019t have to eat boring meals 247 and it\u2019s okay to have a treat here and there.\n\nShe should find ways to fit it into her daily macros or just do some extra cardio. Crash diets don\u2019t work and result in train wrecks like this.", "ESH \n\nyou should be allowed to eat whatever you want without her getting at you for it but i still feel you went a little to far by bringing her some she said she didn\u2019t want to eat. i feel you need to talk to her about how it\u2019s affecting you because you\u2019re probably walking on eggshells. i think maybe eating in a separate room would probably be the best route to go so she doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s in her face though.", "I mean I dunno. Am I selfish to say that she was the one to decide to be on diet, Why try to drag you along? Though ppl do tend to be more snappy and short tempered when they are on diet...", "YTA. You don\u2019t celebrate not doing something (eating unhealthily, heroine, whatever) by doing that thing. That is stinkin thinkin. You are to eat your fast food before you get home and do not offer her a \u201ctreat\u201d. You are welcome not to support her by joining her on the health kick but you eat you drive thru alone.", "NTA. I'm thinking she might be hangry and that's clouding her judgement and spoiling her temper. Soft y.t.a. for bringing her a treat when you know she's been strict about her diet. You guys should discuss this at length, though... *after* a meal.", "ESH \n\nShe's struggling to commit to a diet (which if you are struggling this hard I advise picking a better diet for you. If it's weight loss just a small calorie deficit for most people will work) and she tells you repeatedly even seeing you eat food makes it harder for her. So you bring her the food. She doesn't want it, she craves it and doesn't wanna give in. It's unsupportive and ignorant to do that.\n\nHowever, she is pushing a lot of her stress onto you and that's not fair.\n\nOverall, I think you guys need to talk more about the efficacy of her dieting plan and maybe if she needs to make some adaptations. This sounds like it's far too stressful to justify. The wedding will be over in a day, your life and mental health continues. Starting the marriage with her stressed out of her mind about food will probably not help the beginning of the marriage.", "Nta shes just hangry. Diets suck and I\u2019m not going to lecture on that. As a woman who has had this happen before due to hangryness my suggestion is to eat your treats away from her. If you want to treat her like you did today with chik fil a tell her early in the day so she can plan her meals out and \u201cafford\u201d the calories. Ofcourse she\u2019s going to go off if she has counted and planned her meals and by dinner only had idk say 400 calories left for the day and you show up with mouthwatering chicken and fries that would add 800+ calories in. Keep in mind this is ONLY OKAY in short term dieting for the wedding, this is not a healthy way to live life.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds like she needs a Snickers.", "NTA: This seems a little controlling on her part. I'm sorry it is difficult for her to resist temptation, but that's for her to figure out. \n\nAlso, accusing you of sabotaging is a bit outrageous. Perhaps, communicate next time beforehand but I don't think you were acting on ill intent at all with that either.", "NAH - its wedding jitters, not the food.", "You are not selfish", "nta. you\u2019re not responsible for her diet. i get that eating yummier food around her could be kinda hard for her bc obviously she\u2019d rather the burger than the salad(i would too lmao) but it\u2019s still not fair for you to have to change your diet so she can sustain hers. it\u2019s not this like was a diet you guys decided to do together, P.S even tho she\u2019s on the diet she still could\u2019ve have the treat. weight loss isn\u2019t always ab WHAT food you eat it\u2019s the portions and the cals. her having one treat won\u2019t stop her progress.", "ESH\n\nWhen i was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, i drastically changed my diet to help my gut heal. When my partner didn\u2019t change his eating habits at all, i felt unsupported (and not just in this instance). I didn\u2019t expect him to be exclusively on my diet, but i was doing the cooking and i had to cook two meals cuz I couldn\u2019t eat complex carbohydrates or complex sugars. If he had at least attempted to be supportive of my diet, i would have felt so \u2026..loved, heard, cared for. Didn\u2019t happen. Do something to help her feel supported. Stop eating sugary and greasy things in front of her. You can have them when she\u2019s not around. Be sure to compliment her, too.

Unless you are and she is still getting mad? You weren't very clear about that part. \n\nIf you're being stubborn and eating it infront of her knowing that she can't resist it, then it does seem a tad unsupportive and maybe you should just take it in the other room. Maybe it seems unnecessary in your mind, but why poke the bear?", "I think she is plain hungry and starting to obsess over her diet, which isn't healthy in the first place.  It doesn't sound like it is good for her, mentally or physically. She is starting to view food as \"good\" or \"bad\" which can have major effects down the line. I think you might suggest gently that she talk about it with her doctor or possibly get a referral to a nutritionist. The important thing is that she is healthy for your wedding, not her weight.", "Ya never know, maybe she secretly wants your pants to fall down while at the alter.  \n\nBut what about her dress.

This is not something that you really need to do around her. \n\nDo you have the right to eat what you want, even if she\u2019s on a diet? Yes. Do you have the right to eat it wherever? Yes. Is it kind of you to do it in front of her? Not especially, but you didn\u2019t realize that until she told you. \n\nYou could maybe cut back on unhealthy meals around her, as a show of support. You can still eat what you want, though. Just consider her feelings before you indulge in something you could easily eat in your car or another room.\n\nDeciding your fianc\u00e9e should get a treat from a fast food place was pretty presumptuous. When I used cut back on things I shouldn\u2019t be eating due to health reasons, I felt better treating myself based on whether I felt I deserved it - other people didn\u2019t make that decision for me.\n\nSometimes my mom will want to pick up a treat for me, but because of my recent digestive issues, she\u2019ll ask if I\u2019m allowed to eat it first (my restrictions vary, so it\u2019s hard for her to remember what I can or can\u2019t eat.) I really appreciate that she asks before just buying something for me.\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9e is this tense about her diet, though, don\u2019t ask if she would like to indulge in the thing she\u2019s trying to not indulge in. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking this very seriously - maybe too seriously - but her feelings about her weight matter. \n\nYou could think she\u2019s the most gorgeous girl ever, and think that her losing weight is unnecessary, but she wants to do this so she can feel better about herself. \n\nIf she\u2019s going to change her mind and realize that she\u2019s happy with the weight she is, it won\u2019t be because you told her that *you\u2019re* happy with her weight, so she should be, too. A person\u2019s self-image runs very deep.", "I don't want to say you're the ass because you have good intentions but you aren't taking your fiancees concerns(diet and dress fitting) seriously.\n\nI can understand her being upset with you temping her with her favorite fast food place but you should absolutely be able to eat whatever you want and if you want to be considerate you could do it away from your fiancee while she's on her diet which sounds like is only temporary.", "YTA. There's absolutely no reason to eat crappy fast food anyway. If you want to be nice and supportive at the same time, try to understand the rules of the diet and cook something nice for both of you within the bounds of the diet. See it as an opportunity for you to make better choices for yourself too.", "Nta, diet culture is insanity and can easily bring people down. Bringing her a treat was a great idea and very nice of you to do. People have cheat days, and one unhealthy meal won't sabotage her process.  There seems to be more underlying problems. It sounds like to me she is struggling with body image. It very well could explain why she exploded on you. Make sure you communicate with her and truly listen to her side and her feelings.", "NAH.

I mean that genuinely as someone in therapy lol", "I can understand people saying ESH or NTA, but people saying YTA are brain dead lmfao.\nYou had no ill intent but you know you shouldn\u2019t have done that, but she literally blew up at you for basically no reason.

It\u2019s actually very controlling of her to try to force you to not eat anything she likes near you.", "YTA. Youndont get her a \"treat\" if she doesn't want it.
