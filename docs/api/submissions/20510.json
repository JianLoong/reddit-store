I've tried to be understanding and accommodating, but I also believe that I shouldn't have to alter my eating habits completely just because she's on a diet. I work a very physical job and have an active lifestyle. I've never had the most healthy eating habits but because of how active I am it's never been a problem for me.\n\nTonight was the breaking point. On my way home, I stopped by Chick-fil-A, which happens to be one of my fianc\u00e9e's favorite fast food places. I thought I'd surprise her with a treat since she's been doing so good on her diet. When I got home and told her, she absolutely exploded. She called me selfish and unsupportive, saying that I was intentionally trying to sabotage her progress.\n\nI never meant to hurt her and I genuinely thought I was doing something nice by bringing home her favorite food. But now I'm questioning whether I've been insensitive throughout this whole process. Should I have refrained from eating certain things around her even if they're not part of her diet?

Diet culture sucks. 1) You totally should be able to eat whatever you want and not be beholden to your partner's low calorie choices- this is basic bodily autonomy. 2) It sounds like your fiancee has \"an all or nothing\" approach to the diet and I don't think you're an AH for not knowing that. (aside: Dieting in that way is actually ineffective for achieving long-term weight loss). 3) It also is sad that your fiancee is trying so hard to lose weight that it is leading to conflict between you both, and I imagine she feels pretty crappy moment to moment.", "ESH.  She can't expect everyone to abstain from eating things she won't eat.  But bringing her favorite forbidden food as \"a treat?\"  That's a dick move.

Regardless of whether her diet makes sense or you agree with her need to lose weight or whatever, you need to respect her wishes. Her wishes are not to be tempted by foods that will derail her goals. \n\nIt's not fair of her to ask or demand you to hide your own food choices from her, but it would be considerate of you to try not to flaunt your snacks that you know are temptations for her. A big part of long term relationships is respecting each other's boundaries and being considerate of these small things.\n\nIf you go by Freud, we have the \"id\" (the selfish toddler that just wants to indulge itself constantly) the \"ego\" and the \"superego\" (the conscience and the self control to do things in our long term best interest). You knew her \"id\" would like the Chick Fil-A but you need to focus on appealing to her superego. I have the same issue with my husband who does all the grocery shopping, and buys me snacks to make me happy. Except I'm trying to eat healthier and it's a lot harder to make good choices when I know that those snacks and treats are sitting in the pantry. I understand his impulse because he wants to provide for me, but he has to learn to respect my desire to eat healthier (we're making progress slowly).", "Next time, just ask\n\nAs for this weight loss or health journey, join her. \nI would get upset too, if in trying to better myself and the people around me know it, yet they bring something home for me that doesnt help.

If it's weight loss just a small calorie deficit for most people will work) and she tells you repeatedly even seeing you eat food makes it harder for her. So you bring her the food. She doesn't want it, she craves it and doesn't wanna give in.

Ofcourse she\u2019s going to go off if she has counted and planned her meals and by dinner only had idk say 400 calories left for the day and you show up with mouthwatering chicken and fries that would add 800+ calories in.

This is not something that you really need to do around her. \n\nDo you have the right to eat what you want, even if she\u2019s on a diet? Yes. Do you have the right to eat it wherever? Yes. Is it kind of you to do it in front of her? Not especially, but you didn\u2019t realize that until she told you. \n\nYou could maybe cut back on unhealthy meals around her, as a show of support. You can still eat what you want, though. Just consider her feelings before you indulge in something you could easily eat in your car or another room.\n\nDeciding your fianc\u00e9e should get a treat from a fast food place was pretty presumptuous. When I used cut back on things I shouldn\u2019t be eating due to health reasons, I felt better treating myself based on whether I felt I deserved it - other people didn\u2019t make that decision for me.\n\nSometimes my mom will want to pick up a treat for me, but because of my recent digestive issues, she\u2019ll ask if I\u2019m allowed to eat it first (my restrictions vary, so it\u2019s hard for her to remember what I can or can\u2019t eat.) I really appreciate that she asks before just buying something for me.\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9e is this tense about her diet, though, don\u2019t ask if she would like to indulge in the thing she\u2019s trying to not indulge in.

There's absolutely no reason to eat crappy fast food anyway.

Bringing her a treat was a great idea and very nice of you to do. People have cheat days, and one unhealthy meal won't sabotage her process.  There seems to be more underlying problems.

She struggles with something that comes easy to you, and you don't respect her goals. She is asking for your support while she does this difficult thing, to be her best for your wedding. Eat anything, just not right near her. You not only don't support her efforts, you actively sabotaged her, and called it a treat. That's just mean. You're not listening to her and you're making a hard time harder. A good marriage is a lot of just being kind and helpful to your partner, and helping them be the person they want to be.

She\u2019s expressed something is important to her and your entire post is minimizing it and looking down on it. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s easy for you, this is hard for her.

Your fiance is under enormous pressure to fit under certain beauty and societal standards. She doesn't feel good enough, pretty enough, thin enough, etc. Losing weight is HARD. \n\nI have no idea how she's dieting, but cutting out processed foods isn't silly and is recommended by most reasonably respected nutrition plans. For HER, seeing YOU eat sugary treats is a TRIGGER. \n\nYOU could SUPPORT HER by NOT eating those things in front of her. Yes, it's hard. Yes, it seems unfair. She probably needs therapy to deal with this, but while she figures that out, it's a pretty simple request that she's verbalized more than once to you. \n\nSo in response you go and BUY HER FAST FOOD. \nThis comes across as uncaring, unkind, tone deaf, and as a violation of the boundaries she has set with you & with herself. She has every right to be mad at you. You are not listening to her. \n\nThis isn't about the food. It's about you not listening to her. \n\nListen to her. Hear her. She is telling you plainly what she needs from you. You do not know better than her what she needs for herself. Do not patronize her. \n\nSo many relationships break down because partners just do not listen when the other talks. She's not asking you to read her mind, she literally told you what not to do. And you did it anyway. \n\nSo yes, you're an asshole here. Apologize. Ask her how else you can support her. Empathize. And LISTEN.", "YTA buddy, read the room. Can you not do this in front of your fianc\u00e9? I will predict an early divorce since you are so self absorbed.", "YTA I hate diet culture, but read back everything you wrote and then ask yourself where you thought she\u2019d appreciate you trying to get her to break her diet, did you think she\u2019d eat it and then give up on the diet and therefore wouldn\u2019t be on your case about food anymore?", "Yes, soft YTA.  \nBoth bringing her a treat and actively eating food around her you know she finds hard to resist is sabotage. You really can't enjoy these treats at work and try to be healthier at home? Though not sure you're doing it completely conciously.  \n\n\nI would say - if you have concerns about her diet, such as its impact on her health, mental welbeing, or even your relationship (maybe you don't get to eat together like you used to and its bothering you) - it's completely legitimate to address them head on.", "YTA.  She's trying to lose weight for YOUR wedding and to look the best for you.  \n\nYou are sabotaging her intent to look the best for the wedding.", "YTA\n\nDieting is tough even without factoring in other life circumstances, let alone right before a wedding! The months leading up to my own (relatively small) wedding were still so incredibly stressful with all the planning, I couldn\u2019t imagine trying to throw a restrictive diet on top of things and not be irritable and short tempered. Beauty standards are a hell of a thing, and many women put a lot of pressure on themselves to have the best body possible for their wedding day. \n\nSo sure, she\u2019s definitely being irrational by getting upset with you for eating snacks around her. What is utterly confounding to me is how you would, with the above in mind, somehow think that *presenting her with her favourite junk food* would be some sort of reward?! She gets upset even just being around you eating junk food! You know this! This is an almost profound level of cluelessness, my guy.

It\u2019s not okay to respond like that. Even if she had talked to you before it\u2019s not acceptable treatment. Frustration is understandable, but gotta find healthier ways to express it.\n\n\nI\u2019m like you, I\u2019ve always been physically active and can eat whatever I want (except gluten, dairy, egg, beef) and I look fit. My partner struggles and puts in more effort diet/exercise wise and looks overweight because they are. What helped me understand this is think of a goal/objective/job that you need more time and focus on finished by end of day. How difficult does it become when multiple people start asking you to help them with their tasks, and offer their incorrect unsolicited input frequently about the thing you are working on. Or you are given the wrong tools/materials to do the job when you keep requesting for the one or two tools/materials you need to get it done by end of day. Think of this but every day for a longer duration but it\u2019s food/dieting and weight loss. Because that\u2019s what it\u2019s like with a little extra difficulty added to it. Your partner is working this job (weight loss) every day, probably keeps getting unsolicited advice (most people love to tell people how to diet or lose weight or discourage it or to just eat this it\u2019s fine and have a lot of misinformation or non-applicable information) and keeps being offered/given the wrong information/materials (food not in meal plan, temptations of food that just exist because life) when she has specified what she needs.\n\n\nWhat you need to understand is your partner is doing something they are struggling with and have asked for your support. She has mentioned how she is having difficulties with you eating what you want but hasn\u2019t restricted you from eating it (which is fair you should be able to eat what you want, but I don\u2019t blame her for commenting/complaining).\n\n\nSo what do now? Sit down with your partner. Tell her you love her and want to be supportive of her goals. Tell her that you will not bring any snacks home for her unless she has a pre-approved list she can leave on the fridge or in your phone notes of snacks she would be comfortable eating (like halo-halo frozen dessert or something? I don\u2019t know just make sure it\u2019s pre approved) that you could pick up for her once every 2-3 weeks as a \u201cI love you have something delicious that won\u2019t totally blow your hard work out the window this week because this is how I express love.\u201d Talk about if?she is having difficulties with what you are eating if you should eat separately and not talk about what you ate or if she just wants to vent and don\u2019t comment about how good it is when she does this. If she has any easy requests that don\u2019t put you out or only would be a slight inconvenience I would consider doing it, but open the dialogue for what you can do as a partner to help. My partner really values sharing a meal, but because of my food sensitivities and their weight loss goals we have to eat different meals. What we do is we share roast veggies and salads as sides so we still have that something in common. This forms a camaraderie because we both are in this how we can be.\n\n\nIf you really want to understand her more on a logical/theory level learn about dieting. My partner sat me down after 7 years of trying to lose weight on their own to and told me they needed my full support and they need help with meal plans. I agreed because I want my partner to reach their goals. So I asked some basic questions like daily calories, caloric deficients and how often we need to alter them, what they want me to count (calories, macros, etc), what type of diet they want to follow (keto, paleo, Mediterranean, 80 20 rule, etc) and what proportions they want of things (protein, carbs, etc). I then made some mock up meal plans and got them to approve them. Doing all that work and having to research and do the calculations and planning made me realize how difficult this is. My partner is food obsessed and always hungry unless we curate their meals carefully so they get enough protein and carbs to sate them. So also having some notes for adjustments would be good as well.\n\n\nI also do not eat a lot of things I use to in front of my partner because I get this will be a temporary thing and then we can enjoy things together every once in a while when they are where they want to be. My partner also has mad food envy/jealousy and I don\u2019t want my partner to feel bad not only about not being able to eat what I\u2019m eating but feel bad about feeling that way over me enjoying something I like. We have planned at certain weights they will start doing a 80 20 rule diet and they get to chose how often and where we eat. Enjoying a meal is a bonding this for my partner and I.\n\n\nI get you love her as she is because I love my partner as they are, but they need different things for themselves to feel good than what we want for them to feel good and we need to respect that (as long as it\u2019s still healthy behaviour). So ask her how you can support her better. Do not mention getting her favourite food. Don\u2019t get treats unless you have determined that you can get specific treats for her either upon request or once every 2-3 weeks.\n\n\nI get you may not want to do any of this and that\u2019s fair. It\u2019s her struggle and it shouldn\u2019t inconvenience you. You are planning on marrying her and this is a reflection of the type of relationship you have. Why I do all these super inconvenient things for me that do t effect me specifically? Because it\u2019s so inconsequential to me at the end of the day and if it can make that big of a difference for my partner why wouldn\u2019t I want to do that for them? This is my life partner, someone I\u2019m going to have debt and bigger responsibilities with, go through serious health struggles with when we are old, someone who always looks out for me and is just as supportive when I need it. I see the effort and sacrifices my partner makes for me, so doing this diet thing for them is the least I can do to show my love and support because we will go through more together.\n\n\nSorry for this forever ramble, I still can\u2019t judge this.
