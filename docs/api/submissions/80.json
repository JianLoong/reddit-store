A and I never really got along when I was younger up because of the age gap but I love her more than anything. A has a boyfriend, S(26M) and they have a child, L(3F). \n\nMy sister had a night out with her work which was very important. Well, S was supposed to watch L while my sister went out, she wouldn't be gone all night. \n\nWell, the day before this was supposed to happen, S went out and got drunk and stole money from my sister and her friend to buy more alcohol. My sister was furious and kicked him out. The next day, she came to us and dropped L off. She was crying and I told her that it's time to break it off and that she doesn't deserve to feel like this because of him. She agreed and will be breaking up with him when he decides to get in touch since he blocked her on everything.\n\nWell, yesterday S decided to show up at our house in the afternoon to try and take L. He clearly wasn't sober. My mother had to run over to my grandparents house to help my grandmother and left me with L since she was asleep. S decided to let himself in and tried to go grab L's stuff. I stopped him and took him far away from my bedroom where L was napping.\n\nHe demanded that I let him take his daughter while I refused and threatened to call my uncle (who's in the police force) and threatened to expose his job. He is a drug dealer. He didn't like that so I ended up getting my dog (who is very well trained) and threatened to get him to attack if he didn't leave my house. He left the house, stomping out the door and slamming it which woke L up. I immediately called my mother and she came over as soon as she could.\n\nWell, today I found out that J and S are back together. He told her and she and his family are texting and calling my mother calling me an asshole and telling her to punish me and make me respect my elders. \n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1667247632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yinqpo/aita_for_kicking_my_bil_out_of_my_mothers_house/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Damn girl good job!", "NTA- OP you didn't hand a baby over to a drug dealer who stole from your sister and her friend. \n\nHonestly, you should put an anonymous tip in with the police before this gets even more out of hand, that man likely has no business being around any children. \n\nIncluding you.", "NTA.

You've even mentioned the family thinking that the sister can do no wrong, so my biggest fear is the family trying to protect them, especially with the authorities\n\nEven without any charges or jail, CPS will have a much easier time proving the environment is not safe for the child.

I dont see how its NOT believeable. Like I said, don't believe me if you want but OP wants me to update people on the situaton since she can't. I can't see how I would benefit from pretending to know her and lying about everything. What could I possibly gain from that?", "Yeah, I prefer to look at the worst outcome instead of the best so I dont get upset if something bad happens. \n\nIf the worst happens, OP and her mother will fight to have Teddy live. I recently got a bulldog puppy and she'll be trained to protect our house as well since we've had break in attempts as well. OP would die for Teddy. Tbh, we all would"]}
