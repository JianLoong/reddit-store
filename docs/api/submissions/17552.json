It is still worth remembering that nobody wants to take a child from their parents. Every effort will be made to keep families together, so for your sister have been taken from their care means there have been serious issues. While I don't know the nuances here, if they are having big enough issues to justify removing a child from their care, is it good for the child to be spending a lot of time in their care?

That way, every interaction is recorded and they can be presented to the child's case worker if necessary.\n\nYou are not a parent but you have the custody of your sister, and your mother who has some visitation rights, so that app may be a solution for you not to cut contact with your mother but still have all messages between the two of you properly recorded and ready to serve as proof, should any disagreement arise.\n\nSince I've seen redditors debate those apps in this very sub, could someone join here to clarify this, please, and help OP?\n\nThank you. \n\nOP: you're NTA.", "OP - at this point your job is to do what is best for 6.

What protections would you put in place? This is what you need to assess in your interactions to help you be more objective.\n\nFor me, the pushiness and the degradation of you and your abilities as a caretaker would be a red flag and have me pulling back.

Parents and family are a huge part of our social identity formation, how we see ourselves belonging in this world. But at the end of the day, parents and family members are just people. You don\u2019t owe them anything. Parents, on the other hand, owe their kids safety and love. Period. \n\nNow an anecdote from my work, as a pediatric nurse: I have a patient who struggles with substance use. Her mother was a chronically ill alcoholic, who was non adherent to treatments. This patient cared for her mother and her younger sister since she was 8 years old. The whole family is pretty unstable, and no one stepped up to support this, now, teenager and her school aged sister. Recently the patients mother died, and the patient spiraled, as blames herself for her mother\u2019s death because she felt responsible for her care.

The only choice that matters is your choice to do right by her and keep her safe.  It's already such a big, kind thing you've decided to do.", "FWIW, I didn\u2019t attend supervised visits between my 3 grandkids and their parents.  And it all came down just as I knew it would.  Dad showed up drunk or drugged up with a girlfriend the kids didn\u2019t even know - and mom tried to play mind games with them *in front of their caseworkers*.  In the long run this helped so much when we went to court because the caseworkers were fabulous witnesses.  It also helped the caseworkers get the kids hooked up with the mental health services they needed.  And in the long run the parents didn\u2019t get - or ask for - visitation.  That alone made life around here easier.", "Please considering reminding your mother that if you were to help her break the rules by allowing her sleep overs and extended visitation times, that you could get in trouble and potentially have your sister removed from your care as well.

Most social workers see parents acting up every day and know exactly how to document such things. It can only help op in court to set up such visits."]}
