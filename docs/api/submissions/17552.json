I don't have any experience raising children, I admit that, but I don't think anyone does going into it. My dad (46M) hasn't contacted me since, but that isn't really unusual for him. \n\nThe problem is that my mother is pushing for a lot of visitation, and wants my sister to stay at her house every weekend and to see her every day after school. Visitation is allowed but at mine and the social worker's discretion, and I think that it's too much. I've tried offering a lower level of vistation but she won't have it. I feel bad taking my sister away from our mother but I honestly believe it's for the best. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for your kind words.

I'm petty as hell and have ZERO patience or tolerance for abusive and neglectful parents personally (lots of history there).

Controversial as it may be to say, sometimes, it is NOT best for a child to be with their parent or see them.

If you continue contact with your mother (about other things), just keep a script of \"you will need to call your case worker to arrange that.\" Any time she asks about visits. You can set up calls and video calls with your sister and your mom for check-ins, but depending on the reason for removal, your sister may not want much contact with your mom and/or dad. \n\nPlease put your sister's interests first in this situation. I know it's very difficult to navigate your own relationship with your parents and then manage your sister's relationship, but if it helps you, imagine yourself not as her sister or your mom's daughter, but instead a third- party guardian (foster parent) who's only interest lies with the well- being of the child. She is 6 and this is a crucial time in her development. You are 22 and your mom is 46, you two will be able to rebound much better from this situation. \n\nThank you for taking care of your sister.
