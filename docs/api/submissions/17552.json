Focus on caring for your sister and you can't go wrong.", "NTA-I want to offer being a mom for a minute and tell you that I\u2019m very proud of you OP!! You are doing a great job!", "You are not taking her away from anyone.  Your parents obviously did something very wrong.  You are doing the right thing, protect your sister. NTA.", "NTA- First off, how the hell does your mom say that you are young and stupid? Ain't that hypocritical, you wanna call your child stupid but at the same time get your child taken away by CPS? Good on you for taking care of your sister, as you should. They should be at least thankful that they know their kid is safe with someone they know, let alone other family.", "NTA. There was a reason she was taken away and it is amazing that you can and are able to take her in. Don't let your mom make you feel guilty about this. She is likely the cause that put her in this situation. Based on what you have said, i wouldn't allow any type of visitations right now.", "NTA. You're doing a great thing for your sister by taking her in. And you will probably mess things up but so do all parents. And obviously, your parents must have messed up quite a bit to lose custody. Your mother's reaction to the situation is unrealistic and like others say, prioritize how you can best care for your sister, first. Try not to add too much stress to yourself or spread yourself too thin so that you can't provide good care. \n\nWhat does the social worker suggest? It would seem to me that while it would be normal for your sister to miss your mom because that's all she knew, but now, keeping her on a normal routine in a safe and stable environment would be much better for her well being. She probably will have some ptsd to get over in the meantime.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is trying to steamroll you because to her, you are her child that has to do what she says. Time to shine up your spine and only go through the social worker for communications. Also, look into the definition of harassment and what it takes to send a cease and desist letter", "NTA\n\nYour number one concern should be your sister's well-being. Obviously it is. You are caring for her under the guidance of a social worker. There's a reason you have been awarded custody. You give her the best chance at a normal life.", "NTA. Talk to the social worker about her harassment and demands. They'll have guidelines for what they deem appropriate. It's not up to your mom.\n\nThat's way too much visitation. I would ask your sister if she wants to see your mom and if so, have supervised visitation at a place, no more than an hour or two every other week.\n\nSister was removed from the home for a reason and there's no reason for her to see your mom if she doesn't want to right now.\n\nIs she in therapy?", "NTA. Can you mention the pressure you're getting from mom next time you talk with the social worker? They might be able to offer support navigating that, such as the social worker asking her to simmer down, contact happening through a monitored app instead of regular messages, etc. It sounds like your mom wants BARELY less contact with your sister than before she was removed; if that was safe for your sister she probably wouldn't have BEEN removed. It's OK to tell your mom that you're offering X and she can take that or accept nothing, that this isn't a negotiation and she doesn't get to make demands anymore. It's an incredibly difficult situation to navigate, especially given your age (as in you haven't been out of the house long enough to have had to have many of this kind of boundary conversation with her before now on top of being thrust into parenting) but it sounds like you're handling it as well as anyone could. Good luck!", "You're 22 and too stupid to raise a kid but apparently her being 24 and raising a kid is fine? \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 NTA you're doing great! Keep your sister safe", "Jesus yes. They should be on their knees thanking God their child got custody because otherwise she\u2019d be in foster care, like you mentioned. OP should bring that up:\nHOW DARE YOU TAKE CUSTODY?\nSooo\u2026I should just give her to the state? You realize that you would get to see her WAAAY LESS if that were the case? Shall I surrender her? Is that what you\u2019re telling me? You\u2019d prefer her to be with strangers who may only be doing this for the money given to them than her sister who loves her?\nDon\u2019t bring up the fact she only has herself to blame, she will not accept blame without intervention.\nNTA and good luck OP. From one mom: be present and be firm. Your sister will push you to discover boundaries so establish them immediately. And make sure she knows you love your sister. It\u2019s gonna be tough but you got this. And talk to a lawyer about how to deal with your mom. THAT is above our pay grade and you need a professional for this.", "Your comment has been removed because it does not address the OP in good faith.\n\nIf you suspect a post breaks one of our rules, please report it instead of commenting. \n\nContinuing to post comments like this will lead to a ban.\n\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "In this situation, would it be allowed for OP to direct her mother to only contact her through the social worker?  So OP blocks her, forcing mom to contact social worker to arrange visitation.", "Setting boundaries now will be much better than later.  Coordinate everything through social services.  The child was removed for a reason.  Unsupervised or excessive visitation at this point could jeopardize your custody entirely as the child is not being sheltered from those who abused or neglected her.  Good luck, OP.  You are changing a life.", "Try thinking of it not as cutting contact, but as taking a break to reset. \n\nYou and your sister need to do a reset and get used to what your lives look like now. Your mom needs to do a reset to acknowledge what she needs to do to get her relationship with her kids back on track. Taking a short break where you don\u2019t communicate as often might be the best way to get that reset started.", "You can love from a distance. Your mother needs to acknowledge her part in the situation and do better", "I didn\u2019t know apps like this exist but it\u2019s a bloody brilliant idea. I hope OP sees your comment!", "The school may actually already know some of what\u2019s happened. Several members of my family are teachers, and they\u2019ve all been involved in at least one CPS investigation for a student, so I feel like some of the school staff have probably already been involved. \n\nBut it\u2019s definitely worth having a conversation with the principal and the office staff about who is and is not allowed to pick sister up from school. You don\u2019t have to be super specific about what\u2019s happened or why, but they should know \u201cI now have primary custody of Sister, and no one but me and (insert possible other emergency contact type person) should be allowed to pick her up from school.", "Try googling for \"apps for custody communication\" and you'll find several apps on the list, some of them free. The top result offers recorded messages, phone and video calls, shared calendar, etc. Other apps allows adding professional contacts to the convo, like a mediator or therapist, or notes for medical appointments, school details or ongoing medication, etc", "Well, that is good news. Thank you for taking the time to answer my question.", "The struggle comes because your mom has been in charge of you for most of your life, but she's not in charge now - she's not even in charge of her younger daughter! That you are the one who calls the shots is not a situation that she will accept gracefully - and it's going to be fairly tough on you too.  \n\nThere is a key thought to keep uppermost: you are in charge of your life and your household - your mom has no decision-making power over you. This advice is useful even without your sister in the picture.\n\nu/PotatoLover-3000 has great advice - compartmentalize the interactions so that she doesn't get to manipulate you to get her way.  She's had most of your lifetime learning how to get you to do what she wants. Some guard-rails are warranted.", "If you can manage it with your budget and your schedule, it might be good for you and your sister to start seeing counselors. You\u2019ve both been through a lot, and talking to a professional might help you get straight on what the best thing to do is."]}
