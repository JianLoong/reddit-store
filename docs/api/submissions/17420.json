After she got engaged she started telling me she was going to take the kids away and move them to the city where her now husband lives and that\u2019s caused some tension these last couple of months.\n\nThis last Friday, she called and asked me if the kids can stay with her this weekend since it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day (it was my weekend) and I said okay. When I went to pick up my kids that evening from their after school program, my youngest (7) immediately ran to me and began crying saying he didn\u2019t want to go with his mom this weekend to her wedding. I had NO clue she planned on getting married this weekend, this had been the first I heard anything about it. My kid was inconsolable so I had him call his mom and talk about it with her. He cried and told her multiple times that he wasn\u2019t going and after she tried a while to get him to change his mind, she finally said okay and that she\u2019d just take our older (10). Our older then went to the phone and said he didn\u2019t want to go either and was very firm in saying so. Their mom was pissed and hung up on them both, then minutes later our oldest (in their 20s) called yelling at me saying I should be forcing them to go. The kids both started crying at this point saying they didn\u2019t want to and I said that it was up to them and I wasn\u2019t going to force them when they were so upset. They ended up not going and how my oldest is refusing to talk to me and saying I said something to change the kid\u2019s minds about going. I do feel bad that they missed the wedding but they were both so upset and I had no clue it was going to happen so I didn\u2019t really have much time to talk to them about it.", "created_utc": 1684272506, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jhssm/aita_for_letting_my_kids_skip_their_moms_wedding/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And hopefully some form of agreement over the kids' long-term custody, residency, etc.\n\nYes, it's healthy and proper for the kids to be at the wedding and celebrating with their mom, but their not wanting to be there isn't--based on what you've said--your fault.  \n\nI worry that your ex hasn't been putting the kids at the forefront if this is where things are right now.", "NTA. And get an attorney. She can\u2019t just declare that she\u2019s moving with your children. That\u2019s not how it works.", "NTA, but this is a mess. \n\nForcing upset children to go to the wedding would have been distressing for them, their mother, and guests. \n\nDo you know how much notice your children had of the wedding? Do they know about their mother wanting to move them to a different city?\n\nYou need to speak to a lawyer about your ex\u2019s plans to move your children to another city, if you have not already done so.", "It sounds like something very wrong is happening at your ex's house if the kids are behaving this way.\n\nNTA. Talk to your kids about what is going on, and try to get whatever your ex is saying about moving the kids in writing, and CALL YOUR LAWYER.", "Your younger children don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. It was clearly difficult for them and you provided a solution that made them more comfortable. I\u2019m my opinion, that means you\u2019re NTA. \n\nI admit I\u2019m biased because I grew up in a divorced household and hated being forced into things like that. \n\nI think as long as you\u2019re putting your kids first because you love them and not out of spite, you\u2019re probably not going to be the AH.", "NTA. If your kids were that upset about it then her wedding likely would have turned out disastrous and it would have been another traumatic memory to scar their psyches. You did the right thing and if they're not already in counseling perhaps you should consider it for the both of them, this divorce sounds like it's having a particularly stressful impact on them and it might stop long term anxiety/depression in them before it starts (and trust me when I say that when you suffer from depression in your pre-adolescent and teenage years it's ESPECIALLY difficult to overcome).", "NTA. Sounds like your eldest is being poisoned against you by your ex, which I'm pretty sure can affect custody", "NTA. Your Ex's new marriage is off to a good start. The idea your kid had to tell you. Be ready with open ears and heart for your kids. Sounds like she might try forcing the family card.", "NTA, how could you have said something to encourage them not to go when you didn't even know about it?", "NTA.  Kids don\u2019t want to go and seems like it\u2019s because your ex wife just railroads over what they want for her own wishes.", "NTA. I don't know what yr custody arrangement is, but many have something along the lines of not taking children on a trip w/o the ex's knowledge. \n\nFrom what you say, it sounds like the kids themselves did not want to go (maybe you want to look into why?) and nothing you said to them. Shame that your oldest doesn't believe you. Also sounds like you should speak w/your ex about why she didn't notify you about the wedding; getting married might effect whatever alimony arrangements you may have. If she doesn't want to deal w/you, she can always go thru a lawyer/advocate.", "NTA - Your job is to protect your young children, both physically and emotionally. Clearly there is a bigger issue which needs to be looked into as to why they reacted so strongly, but lacking time for that you absolutely made the right call for your children. I am also very concerned that your ex felt it was appropriate to hang up on her young children, I hope you have an attorney you can talk to about possible changes to your custody agreement, if need be.", "INFO: Are mother's and father's days not addressed in the parenting plan/custody arrangement? If it is and it is her weekend, you should comply with the agreement. I know you said it was negotiated, but I'm just surprised it wasn't in the agreement.\n\nI'm going to go with NTA. Their mother should have planned her wedding to be specifically on the days she has the kids if she wanted them to be there. It was completely within her control to do that, and she chose not to, instead planning her wedding on your weekend and using Mother's day as an excuse to get her kids to attend her wedding instead of being open and honest with everyone.", "NTA, and it is good that you stand up for your kids. Their mother is doing everything right if she wants the relationship with their step parent to be as broken as it can be.", "NTA \n\nYour kids do not want, feel happy and/or comfortable to go. You are doing what's best for your children. They were clearly distressed. They should not be forced to do something they clearly do not want to do. You are protecting your children.", "NTA", "Info: do they not want to go to the wedding because you told them her intentions of moving out of town?", "NTA and you need to get back in front of a court for parental alienation immediately. Your kids clearly believe she's taking them away if she gets married, and she's already turned the oldest against you. Get that custody agreement tightened up.", "NTA.  Contact a lawyer and have him ready for the attempts to take them across state lines and to try to move them from home area.", "NTA. Good job standing up for your children. Do you have a court-ordered visitation and custody arrangement? If not, please find an attorney asap. It sounds like your ex has said enough around your children that they are scared to go with her.", "NTA - likely doesnt need to be said, but be sure all of this is documented and the ole layer is well informed", "INFO: what does your custody order/agreement say about switching weekends?", "Something feels missing about this entire story. Your kids were having very oversized reactions here, which seems to indicate either:\n\n* Your oldest was right and you DID say something to stir the pot with your kids to cause them to not want to go, OR\n* Your ex-wife has behaved in an abusive manner towards the kids, so they are afraid to spend time with her, which is a very serious situation and needs to be investigated immediately, OR\n* You and your ex-wife have done a monumentally poor job of managing the divorce for the kids, so they are terrified of the wedding and not at all able to adjust to the idea of it - meaning you need to get your kids into therapy to address the damage that has been inflicted.\n\nIn 2 of 3 of these situations you are contributing to being TA, so I'm going to go with ESH.", "INFO\n\nHow did you have no clue she was getting married? What is this co-parenting situation?\n\nWho is she marrying? Why were the kids this upset?", "Info - did you try to talk to your kids to determine why they were reacting this way? At 7 and 10, this reaction may not be them being upset about the wedding itself. Heck, there are kids that go over the top like this just because they want to stay home to watch TV or hang out with friends.", "Soft ESH and I'll explain. People can disagree with me, but I'm speaking from my personal experience of being that kid. First the ex is hugely the A H here. Who doesn't tell their co-parent they're getting married!?! You both should have been unified in your communication this whole time and it seems like she was hiding that info from you.  \n\nHowever, like i said, I've been in your kids' shoes. I remember crying to my dad about my mom's wedding. What I needed from him, and what he gave me, was assurance that he would be there for me, that no one would replace him, and that it was a big change and it would all be ok. For your kids, the change is coming no matter what. You could have comforted and assured your kids and maybe they would have changed their mind about the wedding (as I did). But I can't imagine making my kid go to something they were so freaked out about either, so I see that you were in a bind. \n\nOf course the fun part was that it was all a lie and my dad ghosted me not long after my mom got married. My stepdad turned out to be a gem of a human who raised me as his own till his dying day. So if you can assure your kids and mean it, then you'll all be the winners here.", "Soft YTA here\u2026I\u2019m not for forcing kids to do things that they don\u2019t want to do but this is an important milestone. It is messed up that she didn\u2019t mention the wedding but by not having them attend such an important event it strains the relationship with their mother. \n\nThe kids have a new stepfather, it is crucial for them to understand and accept this so they don\u2019t grow up in a broken family. As their father, you should also show your support because you are becoming a blended family. I appreciate that you listen to their concerns but you should have had a conversation with them about why they didn\u2019t want to attend and how that would make their mother feel by not going. \n\nNow, if there is something happening behind closed doors that is causing them to be so upset about being with their mom, that needs to be addressed but if they don\u2019t want to go simply because they don\u2019t want to see their mom get married to a new man and you just let them, you\u2019re giving in to entitled behavior and have a hand in straining the relationship further.\n\nThink about if you were to get married, would you want your children to attend?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is actively trying to help her mom move the kids away.", "Our agreement doesn\u2019t have anything about holidays. In the past if it falls on the other\u2019s weekend we\u2019ve always let the kids go and celebrate with their parent.

It\u2019s been incredibly hostile since she\u2019s announced she wants to move, even a couple weeks ago I called my older and asked if he wanted to go to orientation for the new middle school he\u2019d be starting in the fall and in the background his mom started yelling \u201che\u2019s not going you idiot, we\u2019re moving!\u201d So I imagine things like that are not helping.", "I feel like there are far more than 3 options.

The only reason I even knew she was engaged was because she called me a couple months ago saying she was engaged, moving to where her fianc\u00e9 lives and is taking the kids with her.\n\nI do worry that she is being emotionally abusive/manipulative with them.

Wtf", "After reading other comments by OP, my guess is kids are flipping out bc the mom wants them to move with her now that she's gotten married and they don't want to move. To their little brains they have to move bc mom got married.", "Omg. No. You absolutely need to do everything you can to keep those children with you.

I think at this point they were having trouble with mom marrying someone new and the fact that she wants to move them away.", "Yeah I didn\u2019t want to go there because I didn\u2019t want to assume, but that\u2019s definitely a possible concern that needs to be eliminated.", "It's literally in his first paragraph.  Threatening to take this kids 4 hrs away since she's been engaged.  He also commented he oldest is also trying to help the mother fo this.  Don't be do naive. She was gonna ise this to take them.
