After she got engaged she started telling me she was going to take the kids away and move them to the city where her now husband lives and that\u2019s caused some tension these last couple of months.\n\nThis last Friday, she called and asked me if the kids can stay with her this weekend since it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day (it was my weekend) and I said okay. When I went to pick up my kids that evening from their after school program, my youngest (7) immediately ran to me and began crying saying he didn\u2019t want to go with his mom this weekend to her wedding. I had NO clue she planned on getting married this weekend, this had been the first I heard anything about it. My kid was inconsolable so I had him call his mom and talk about it with her. He cried and told her multiple times that he wasn\u2019t going and after she tried a while to get him to change his mind, she finally said okay and that she\u2019d just take our older (10). Our older then went to the phone and said he didn\u2019t want to go either and was very firm in saying so. Their mom was pissed and hung up on them both, then minutes later our oldest (in their 20s) called yelling at me saying I should be forcing them to go. The kids both started crying at this point saying they didn\u2019t want to and I said that it was up to them and I wasn\u2019t going to force them when they were so upset. They ended up not going and how my oldest is refusing to talk to me and saying I said something to change the kid\u2019s minds about going. I do feel bad that they missed the wedding but they were both so upset and I had no clue it was going to happen so I didn\u2019t really have much time to talk to them about it.", "created_utc": 1684272506, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jhssm/aita_for_letting_my_kids_skip_their_moms_wedding/", "score": 574, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s not how it works.", "NTA, but this is a mess. \n\nForcing upset children to go to the wedding would have been distressing for them, their mother, and guests. \n\nDo you know how much notice your children had of the wedding?

If your kids were that upset about it then her wedding likely would have turned out disastrous and it would have been another traumatic memory to scar their psyches. You did the right thing and if they're not already in counseling perhaps you should consider it for the both of them, this divorce sounds like it's having a particularly stressful impact on them and it might stop long term anxiety/depression in them before it starts (and trust me when I say that when you suffer from depression in your pre-adolescent and teenage years it's ESPECIALLY difficult to overcome).", "NTA.

Shame that your oldest doesn't believe you. Also sounds like you should speak w/your ex about why she didn't notify you about the wedding; getting married might effect whatever alimony arrangements you may have. If she doesn't want to deal w/you, she can always go thru a lawyer/advocate.", "NTA - Your job is to protect your young children, both physically and emotionally.

Their mother should have planned her wedding to be specifically on the days she has the kids if she wanted them to be there.

Your kids were having very oversized reactions here, which seems to indicate either:\n\n* Your oldest was right and you DID say something to stir the pot with your kids to cause them to not want to go, OR\n* Your ex-wife has behaved in an abusive manner towards the kids, so they are afraid to spend time with her, which is a very serious situation and needs to be investigated immediately, OR\n* You and your ex-wife have done a monumentally poor job of managing the divorce for the kids, so they are terrified of the wedding and not at all able to adjust to the idea of it - meaning you need to get your kids into therapy to address the damage that has been inflicted.\n\nIn 2 of 3 of these situations you are contributing to being TA, so I'm going to go with ESH.", "INFO\n\nHow did you have no clue she was getting married? What is this co-parenting situation?\n\nWho is she marrying? Why were the kids this upset?", "Info - did you try to talk to your kids to determine why they were reacting this way? At 7 and 10, this reaction may not be them being upset about the wedding itself. Heck, there are kids that go over the top like this just because they want to stay home to watch TV or hang out with friends.", "Soft ESH and I'll explain. People can disagree with me, but I'm speaking from my personal experience of being that kid. First the ex is hugely the A H here. Who doesn't tell their co-parent they're getting married!?! You both should have been unified in your communication this whole time and it seems like she was hiding that info from you.  \n\nHowever, like i said, I've been in your kids' shoes. I remember crying to my dad about my mom's wedding. What I needed from him, and what he gave me, was assurance that he would be there for me, that no one would replace him, and that it was a big change and it would all be ok. For your kids, the change is coming no matter what. You could have comforted and assured your kids and maybe they would have changed their mind about the wedding (as I did). But I can't imagine making my kid go to something they were so freaked out about either, so I see that you were in a bind. \n\nOf course the fun part was that it was all a lie and my dad ghosted me not long after my mom got married. My stepdad turned out to be a gem of a human who raised me as his own till his dying day. So if you can assure your kids and mean it, then you'll all be the winners here.", "Edit to change judgement from Soft Y  T  A  to soft ESH as I believe it is more fitting\u2026I\u2019m not for forcing kids to do things that they don\u2019t want to do but this is an important milestone. It is messed up that she didn\u2019t mention the wedding but by not having them attend such an important event it strains the relationship with their mother. \n\nThe kids have a new stepfather, it is crucial for them to understand and accept this so they don\u2019t grow up in a broken family. As their father, you should also show your support because you are becoming a blended family. I appreciate that you listen to their concerns but you should have had a conversation with them about why they didn\u2019t want to attend and how that would make their mother feel by not going. \n\nNow, if there is something happening behind closed doors that is causing them to be so upset about being with their mom, that needs to be addressed but if they don\u2019t want to go simply because they don\u2019t want to see their mom get married to a new man and you just let them, you\u2019re giving in to entitled behavior and have a hand in straining the relationship further.\n\nThink about if you were to get married, would you want your children to attend?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Record face to face interactions with your ex and daughter if you are allowed to do so.\n\nYour kids seemed traumatized at the thought of going to the wedding, that's not normal. \n\nGet in touch with a lawyer, let them know everything that's been going on, explain the threat to move the kids, the harassing calls from your daughter, the kids reaction to going to the wedding...and everything else that's been going on that you have not mentioned. Clearly the little ones aren't poisoned against you yet, but if she's manipulating your daughter, then you want to cover your ass here.", "I'll bet she wasn't planning on actually telling anyone when she moved. I get the feeling the plan was to move immediately after the wedding, and she threatened the kids to make sure they didn't tell you. You need to lawyer up and find out why the kids had such an extreme reaction ASAP.\n\nYour eldest is a legal adult, and sadly, it looks like your ex has already poisoned their mind.", "Yes, but is there something in writing that says neither parent can leave the state with the children without the other parent\u2019s consent?", "any way she can frame it as in their best interests?", "If Mom has told them she's planning to move them away from you after the wedding, or even if they've overheard something to that effect, it could easily cause them to freak out about the wedding.", "Yeah she's *told* him. Like you said, it's literally in the first paragraph. So if she's brought it up, there's no indication she was going to do anything the day of the wedding, especially when they have a custody agreement.", "Yes there is, she can\u2019t move them 50+ miles without judge\u2019s approval by proving its in children\u2019s best interest.", "I don\u2019t think so. Not anything that would trump getting to be with both parents regularly at least. We already live in a good area with good schools and they have a lot of family here.", "Yes, she\u2019s been telling them that. Any conversation I\u2019ve had with them over the phone too while they\u2019re with her she\u2019ll yell in the background saying she\u2019s moving them. She did it a couple weeks ago when I tried talking to my older child about going to middle school orientation here since he\u2019ll be starting in the fall. She started screaming in the background saying he\u2019s not going because they\u2019re moving.", "I don't underestimate crazy.", "I bet the kids know about her plan to move them away, and that's why they were freaking out.  They were afraid they'd never see Dad again after the wedding.", "Thank goodness for that!", "Doesn't mean she won't try and be sneaky about it.", "Do you think that the kids believe that she\u2019s going to live them after the wedding? Because that may be the plan, legal or not. \n\nNTA.", "And what have you done about it?", "According to them, she\u2019s said they\u2019d move over the summer and they\u2019d start their new schools in a new town in the fall. She hasn\u2019t gone to the court though and requested to move them, which she would need to do at least 45 days prior to the planned move. At least if she tries something illegally I can get the law involved and basically guarantee myself full custody but I\u2019m hoping it doesn\u2019t go that far.", "I\u2019ve posted a few times that I have a lawyer, she hasn\u2019t put in a request to move the kids yet though.", "I wonder if the kids thought they were going to move that weekend.  She has told them she\u2019s moving them like it or not, so maybe they thought this was now?  They seemed very upset- also possible she told them again this is where they were moving and it set them off.  Something to do with this marriage and moving.  It wasn\u2019t the wedding- got to be the supposed move.", "NTA. Also, if you don\u2019t have an attorney already, now\u2019s the time to get on that. My husband\u2019s ex tried to move my stepdaughter across the country with her new husband, and we had to fight her Notice of Relocation (luckily required by the state) in court. After eight months and the best $2500 I\u2019ve ever spent, the judge ruled in our favor. \n\nBut you need to nip this in the bud NOW. Get a concrete custody order that prevents relocation in place ASAP, before she possibly feels froggy enough to move the kids without notice.", "YTA. You felt blindsided that your ex wife was getting remarried that you couldn\u2019t see your kids missing that event is huge. Kids say they don\u2019t want to do shit all the time, using that as an excuse for why you didn\u2019t force them to go is odd. Maybe you aren\u2019t ready to tell them \u201cyour mom found new love and it\u2019s something to celebrate and be a part of\u201d etc etc and didn\u2019t want to be alone on that day while all of your kids and ex wife welcomed a new man into their lives. Either way, as a parent you should\u2019ve set your personal feelings aside and had the kids not miss that major event. I get the family drama aspect, you and wife not splitting on best terms, eldest clearly seeing you and your past mistakes (this is just another one for her to pile on), and you feeling like you can never do right by them. That part sucks and sorry you gotta go thru all that mess.", "NTA. I don't think that two \"inconsolable\" kids would do much for the atmosphere at her wedding. She could force them to go but she couldn't force them to be happy about it. \"If you don't stop crying you will be sorry\" wouldn't accomplish what she wants.", "RED FLAG.  \nNTA. Do you know \\*why\\* your kids don't want to go there?  \nIs it because it's your wife or is it more because of her husband?", "NTA\n\nAs a child of abuse, I beg of you to please ask more questions.  That strong of a reaction shows some seriously big emotions. Parents who physically fight their children need to be checked.   That is not appropriate in any way.   Also, your daughter should not know anything about your child support,  and kids past 12 or 13 can choose where they live.\n\nP.s.\n\nCounseling and therapy sounds like it is so needed for all of you.   Being treated less than by family regardless of who it is \ud83d\udcaf hurts everyone in some way.   You are being a good dad.", "NTA.  This sounds fishy.  You need to talk to the lawyer handling your custody case immediately.\n\nYour kids are clearly traumatized at the thought of being taken that far away from you.  I don't know where you live, but I doubt she can take them that far without your permission.  She's clearly trying to sell them on the idea, because she's probably going to lose this guy if she can't take them away.  He's probably not going to be willing to wait until she's finished raising them with you, so it's very likely that she's probably going to have to give him up.  She will be very resentful, but too bad.  You need to be near your kids too.\n\nI don't want to scare you, but I'm assuming your kids aren't old enough to have a say in court, so I'd be wary about them disappearing suddenly during her custody time because she wants it all.  Lawyer consult, ASAP!", "NTA, sounds like there's a lot more to this story that your ex isn't telling you just based on your kids' reactions being so severe!\n\nI don't see how forcing them to go would help anyone or make your kids retain their trust in you.", "NTA \n\nI do agree their is a more as why both kids didn\u2019t want to go.\n\nSit down with them and ask hey kids can we talk as to reasons why.\n\nIt should of been mentioned to you hey we are getting married on this date can we both talk to the kids about it.", "NTA\n\nSomething about the whole thing smells fishy and sounds suspicious.\n\nYou should definitely check into this because it gives the impression that she ia trying to replace YOU as their father and the younger ones are not pleased at all.", "NTA", "NTA, but it sounds like you need a lawyer, like last week.  Make an appointment.  An urgent one.", "I'd also add that there's no reason to bend over backwards for an ex who just told you she plans to take your kids away from you for her convenience. She bombed any chance at a peaceful and working co parenting relationship. He should really be doing all communication through a lawyer at this point for his own security.", " Your kids clearly believe she's taking them away if she gets married, and she's already turned the oldest against you. Get that custody agreement tightened up.", "Eh. I\u2019m calling BS. Sounds like \u201cmissing reasons\u201d to me.", "Not necessarily. They could simply be against the changing of their family dynamic. It could be that they don't like the idea of them having to move to the city, moving away from their friends and what they know - the wedding symbolises this. \n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that \"something very wrong\" has happened. This is just normal family growth after a divorce that they could be reacting to.", "For real. OP said that was something his ex was probably going to do. I wonder if she\u2019s trying to get the to see her new partner as a new \u2018dad\u2019 or something. Idk how she brainwashed the eldest. I would keep them away from the other two in case they try to bring them away to their mom", "The oldest is an adult in their 20s hardly mom can turn the adult against OP at this stage.", "I thought the same. Maybe it's because there's not much backstory but the kids running out crying out of the blue is weird, also the way the eldest reacted seems off, and there's no explanation for it.\n\nEdit : doesn't mean there's not also something going on at the mother's house, or that the kids don't want the change.", "Definitely agree. No matter what\u2019s going on, they\u2019re seven and ten years old\u2026..as a parent you are supportive and stern about them respecting new additions to a split household and place some value on it too. Having them miss it and not really doing much to get them to see the \u201cbright side\u201d was a mistake.", "Agreed. It\u2019s setting off my spidey senses.", "I\u2019m curious about her relationship with you. All your comments deflect and say things about mom, daughter, kids etc. But never really your relationships and past mistakes you\u2019ve made or things you\u2019ve done in the past. Just seems very one sided going thru this thread and need more pieces of the puzzle. (Why is daughter mad about CS, did you not pay in the past, why does she not like you so much, what relationship did she see that you and mom had, what side of you did she see that the younger two don\u2019t see, etc.)", "I'm sorry to hear this. I had a close family member poisoned against me as well. I suggest you don't take it personally. For me it just became noise on the phone. 3 years later she realizes our mutual grandma was the problem. She apologized. We're cool now", "How do you know?", "They are literally seven and ten years old. How many things do kids say they don\u2019t want to do at that age and with some support from parents end up doing and at the end of the day feel just fine about it. It\u2019s a bit toxic to already create a boundary for them with the new man in the family by separating him and saying \u201cher husband\u201d. That adds turmoil to a rocky situation already and breeds contempt and resentment. it\u2019s time to separate the ugly divorced parents drama from the kids\u2019 lives in OP and his ex\u2019s relationship. They clearly involve the kids WAY too much in their arguments, disagreements and honestly overall drama that is not healthy for either of them (kids). Arguing over the phone, fighting over this, emotionally charged kids at young ages, and zero family peace (hell even the older one is arguing with the rents all the time) has got to stop for any of this to be resolved. Cause let\u2019s be real, this is ONE issue of probably hundreds OP and ex wife have had over the years and they still haven\u2019t gotten it together for the sake of the kids.", "My daughter and I have always had a great relationship. After she turned 18 I paid her rent at every place she\u2019s lived up until last year when she turned 21. I just couldn\u2019t afford it anymore and she didn\u2019t like that, so she moved in with her mom and didn\u2019t talk to me much for a while. After moving in with her mom though she went to not talking to me much to calling me to just say random rude things to me, mostly having to do with her mom and the kids and me not giving them enough child support even though we share 50/50 custody and I do pay over $300 per month for them both. Recently, I discovered my son\u2019s tablet is somehow connected to my phone because my ex was able to see an email notification from Venmo that I paid my girlfriend $600. My ex told my daughter and my daughter called me screaming saying if I can send my girlfriend $600 then I should be able to pay more child support. I let her know that I was paying my girlfriend back because she let me borrow the money so I could pay to have my daughter\u2019s car fixed when it broke down. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not perfect but I\u2019ve done my best and have always been there for my daughter, especially at times when her mom wasn\u2019t.\n\nMy relationship with her mom was fine but she was also verbally abusive toward the end and the way she spoke to me is now the way our daughter speaks to me.", "Thanks for the context. I def can see a clearer picture of your situation and while my recent comment was on YTA  cause major life event etc. I can see WHY you made the decisions you did now. I was going too hard for devils advocate here when really your daughter is just being told negative things about you and making your ex wife\u2019s problems her own, def involving her in your guys\u2019 drama just to have people on her side it seems (which is very sad). I also stated having kids miss a life event like that is wrong but honestly them being around your ex wife seems like the right move \u2620\ufe0f this is hella drama OP and I hope you don\u2019t get too bogged down in it. You\u2019re trying and there for your kids which is the most important thing @ the end of the day.", "NTA.  It was your weekend.  You were going to be nice and let them go over for MD.... but they told you what was really going on. She should have had the courtesy of telling you. \n\n  Normally I'd day those ages don't get to choose of they go or not (most courts would require them to be older) HOWEVER my spidey senses are going off and I think you may have just prevented your ex from taking your kids.", "NTA. Keeping the wedding secret from you is so sketchy! You had no advanced notice of the wedding, it was your weekend, and your kids refused to go. You didn't do anything wrong here. Their mother played games and lost.", "What's the bet the wedding was the move as in ex lied to get OP to hand over the kids willingly. \n\nOP NTA, but I would be double checking your custody agreement in relation to long term long distance swap arrangements because something feels funky here and you need to make sure you don't get denied contact with your kids. I would also be trying to find out why your kids reacted the way they did, it's almost sounds like they were scared they would never see you again after the wedding.", "OP needs clause in the agreement that she can't take them out of state without OP's agreement(Since she hasn't yet moved).", "> don't like the idea of them having to move to the city, moving away from their friends and what they know - the wedding symbolises this.\n\nand this could be the \"very wrong\"  how you approach these changes can be \"very wrong\" and very wrong can be as simple as dropping on them \"we are moving and there is nothing more to discuss\" because yeah telling kids (especially kids who are processing divorce) that they have to also loose their school. their friends, their trusted teachers, their extracurricular activities, their time with the other parent with no discussion is \"very wrong\"", ">\u201cmissing reasons\u201d\n\nmissing missing reasons is generally around why the parent who has children gone no contact is failing to recognize that they have been told why their children have gone no contact despite being told point blank the reasons.\n\nOP is not the parent that the children want to not be in contact with (at least for the wedding, not implying they want complete no contact with mom)  so I am not convinced he would be rug sweeping the reasons his children don't want to go to their mother's wedding.  That is why I think *something* (and again I don't mean something bad it could be as simple as mom told them \"we will all be moving away after the wedding\") is going on at moms", "I think as long as you\u2019re putting your kids first because you love them and not out of spite, you\u2019re probably not going to be the AH.", "You might be surprised at the power a manipulative parent can hold.", "Missing reasons implies a parent is perpetuating an alternative (to the truth) narrative to explain the issues in their relationship with their older children, which OP has. \n\nMaybe he\u2019s being forthright, but this cockamamie story doesn\u2019t really pass the smell test.", "Eldest is in their 20s tho", "She didn\u2019t even tell him it was happening - how supportive should he be about an event he only found out about because his kids were refusing to go? She lied about her reasons for wanting to have them for the weekend. So weird.", "It doesn\u2019t need to pass your smell test, this is AITA lol nothing more.", "Maybe, but the what OP asked about was around his younger childrens desire to not attend their mother's wedding and if he was wrong in supporting them", "Who cares about the relationship with the older child, what does that have to do with him not making his kids go somewhere.", "lol Yeah that pretty much solidified my suspicion.", "Yes those 2 things are definitely unrelated. /s", "Get a trusted friend or IT person to go through phone and the kids' tablets (their phones, too, if they have them).  And go through all your accounts, Venmo, Phone, email, etc.  She may have more access to things than you think - even if it's just viewing, not using.", "It definitely sounds like manipulation. She\u2019s mad you won\u2019t pay her rent so her mom is like oh he\u2019s got money and doesn\u2019t want to help any of us. Their \u201cbonding\u201d is just an attempt to bash you. I\u2019m sure your ex is using your daughter\u2019s calls and outbursts as a way to have a \u201cwitness\u201d to take your sons away. I recommend a lawyer asap. Your daughter sounds unstable and if she\u2019s living with your ex, your sons might be in an unstable environment. Get custody of your sons. Your wife is constantly lying.", "so ... you connect\n\n1) older daughter is pissed at OP\n\n2) younger children don't want to attend mom's wedding\n\nso two diametrically opposed reactions are caused by the same thing and OP is the source of that thing?\n\nYou are really building a narrative out of ... nothing."]}
