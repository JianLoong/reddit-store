We keep contact via texting and video calls but we've never seen each other face-to-face since they moved. They decided to travel to the city I live in so we can spend time together. We had all choosen a lot of things to do in the 2 weeks they're supposed to spend here. The conflict is that I don't want them to stay at my aparrment (like, sleep there overnight) while they're here, but they don't have family or other friends in this state or close by that they can stay with which means they'd have to pay for a hotel. A day ago, when they arrived, we were talking and I asked them which hotel they picked. They were confused and Ana (26F) asked what I meant. They thought they were going to stay at my apartment with me. We hadn't discussed where they would stay before they came here, and I assumed they knew they were going to stay at a hotel since they have never stayed at my home like that and they know I don't let anyone stay over like that. Not even my parents or my boyfriend. They said they thought I had changed my mind about these things, but I never said I had, they just assumed I did. I live at an apartment alone and even though there isn't a guest room I have my old mattress that I could put on the living room or on my hobbies's room, or they could sleep on the couch. But I refused to do so and to pay or help pay for the hotel. They're both very annoyed with me and think I'm being selfish but James (25M) is furious. He thinks I am being ridiculous. Ana accepted to pay but James wants to either go back or make me let them stay in my apartment. They're staying at a hotel at the moment and we didn't do what we planned to yesterday. Ana texted me that she's trying to convince James to stay in the hotel, and maybe she will but nonetheless they both think I should change my mind.\n\nThe reason I don't want them, or anyone, to stay over is because it makes me very uncomfortable to have someone in my home while I am asleep or not there. I hate the ideia of someone touching my things without my permission or seeing something I'd rather they not see, or even stealing something. And they know that, but thought I had become more lenient about it.\n\nI asked my parents and other friends what they think and the general consensus is that it would be nice of me to let them stay but since I am know to be quite neurotic between our friends and family and it's not like I told them I changed my view nor implied they would stay, I wouldn't be in the wrong if I don't allow it.", "created_utc": 1686243672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144eq8h/aita_for_not_letting_my_friends_stay_over_at_my/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nah, I think they didn't want to risk having Op say no so they didn't bring it up until they got there and it would be awkward to say no.", "NTA. Nobody should ever assume they are staying over at your place without confirming with you first - that's incredibly rude of them!", "They never asked about staying with you, right?\n\nDid you invite them to come and visit? I'm just trying to understand where the confusion would have happened.\n\nIf you asked them to come and visit, I get the issue. There is an underlying social invitation there, where ideally you would clarify \"I'd love to see you but I realize the cost of a hotel for the visit would be a lot so I get it might not make sense.\"\n\nBut even if you said, it would be great if you came out- that would be on them. They should have asked if they could stay with you.\n\nSince it sounds like you didn't invite them, NTA. I imagine this is an issue of them, particularly James, being embarrassed. They know you don't do guests and didn't ask the obvious question about housing. Maybe because they were hoping you would feel guilty and just give in. Who knows. It doesn't matter.\n\nThe polite thing to do might be to offer to help Ana look online for an inexpensive place for her to stay.

I am amazed an adult would go on a two week trip without confirming arrangements. This is not something that should be assumed. That's nutty behaviour indeed. But if you suspected that they might want to stay at yours, you should have asked the hotel question before they arrived. I find it nearly improbable that you made all these plans and never had a clue they figured they would stay at yours.", "ESH - Everyone involved made assumptions about a major aspect of this entire trip without talking about it. Yes, you're not obligated to let them stay with you, and they aren't entitled to stay there, but would it really be so bad to put a mattress down when you literally can to do a favor for your friends who traveled to see you? If so, then don't it, but I don't think your friendship will be the same after this. Based on James, he might say this is the end of the friendship.", "ESH. WHY wouldn't you all talk about this beforehand??

I mean, do you know how much it's going to cost them to book two weeks of hotel at the last minute?\n\nYou're kind of a shitty host and I would probably go home and not visit you again if you did this to me.

If you know them, why would you be worried about them stealing or being in the same space as you sleep? That's not very fair to them.\nIs knowingly being neurotic a good reason to behave this way? Is choosing not to try to be less neurotic acceptable?\nThis is a question I cannot answer for you. I am not in a position to judge it. Being neurotic doesn't make you bad, but I also don't think it's a helpful trait to have in excess. \nBetter communication, as others have said, would have prevented this.

They are now in a situation where they\u2019re stuck paying a huge amount of money to visit *you*. You could help out financially or be more flexible and allow them to stay at least a few nights. If you don\u2019t do that, expect this to be the last time they ever want to visit you.\n\nI also really hope you\u2019re in therapy, because being so neurotic that your close friends and boyfriend would steal from you or invade your privacy isn\u2019t normal.", "Your friends knew about your quirk, yes? you still should have been up front as a reminder.

Ultimately it's their responsibility to confirm their trip and what they were doing.

They didn't book a hotel a month in advance.", "What exactly did they book?", "Yes, so they brought it up and then assumed. NTA. They should have asked if you had room for them.", "Have you ever tried to address your issues with therapy? Regrets are not always fun, but the mistakes you make in life are how you learn and figure out who you are. You're missing out on so much by the sounds of it.", "Then why even get married? That\u2019s weird.", "Would your future husband want that ? To live separately after marriage ? If you\u2019re just going to live separate lives with separate homes and the related costs to that.. what\u2019s the point in getting married at all ?", "Even if I didn\u2019t explicitly invite, if I\u2019ve agreed with their discussion about visiting, I\u2019m going to clarify whether or not they\u2019re welcome to stay with me during the course of the conversation or while planning. So I\u2019m definitely side-eyeing OP on that.\n\nBut the others aren\u2019t off the hook either so I say ESH because no one can communicate.", "i read it as they booked the *trip* a month in advance.", "That's a bit more fair. I'm just not the type to assume I'm welcome to spend the night at someone's house. Especially if I'm the one that brings up coming out for a visit. It seems entitled to me. Plus, OP is known among their friends and family for not having people spend the night. The friends just assumed OP changed their mind. In that case, I find OP less TA than the friends by a long shot. They invite themselves to visit, decide that since OP didn't specifically ask about accomodations (when they already knew OP's stance) that because OP didn't specify, OP obviously changed their mind.", "I can see that, but since our comments were about hotel prices, I read it as booking a hotel.", "Yeah I see that. Putting myself in the couple\u2019s shoes, I\u2019m definitely so uncomfortable with the idea of showing up in a foreign city without absolute confirmation that I\u2019m welcome to stay with my friend.\n\nEveryone here is so bizarre to me."]}
