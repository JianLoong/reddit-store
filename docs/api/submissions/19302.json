We keep contact via texting and video calls but we've never seen each other face-to-face since they moved. They decided to travel to the city I live in so we can spend time together. We had all choosen a lot of things to do in the 2 weeks they're supposed to spend here. The conflict is that I don't want them to stay at my aparrment (like, sleep there overnight) while they're here, but they don't have family or other friends in this state or close by that they can stay with which means they'd have to pay for a hotel. A day ago, when they arrived, we were talking and I asked them which hotel they picked. They were confused and Ana (26F) asked what I meant. They thought they were going to stay at my apartment with me. We hadn't discussed where they would stay before they came here, and I assumed they knew they were going to stay at a hotel since they have never stayed at my home like that and they know I don't let anyone stay over like that. Not even my parents or my boyfriend. They said they thought I had changed my mind about these things, but I never said I had, they just assumed I did. I live at an apartment alone and even though there isn't a guest room I have my old mattress that I could put on the living room or on my hobbies's room, or they could sleep on the couch. But I refused to do so and to pay or help pay for the hotel. They're both very annoyed with me and think I'm being selfish but James (25M) is furious. He thinks I am being ridiculous. Ana accepted to pay but James wants to either go back or make me let them stay in my apartment. They're staying at a hotel at the moment and we didn't do what we planned to yesterday. Ana texted me that she's trying to convince James to stay in the hotel, and maybe she will but nonetheless they both think I should change my mind.\n\nThe reason I don't want them, or anyone, to stay over is because it makes me very uncomfortable to have someone in my home while I am asleep or not there. I hate the ideia of someone touching my things without my permission or seeing something I'd rather they not see, or even stealing something. And they know that, but thought I had become more lenient about it.\n\nI asked my parents and other friends what they think and the general consensus is that it would be nice of me to let them stay but since I am know to be quite neurotic between our friends and family and it's not like I told them I changed my view nor implied they would stay, I wouldn't be in the wrong if I don't allow it.", "created_utc": 1686243672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144eq8h/aita_for_not_letting_my_friends_stay_over_at_my/", "score": 3789, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nah, I think they didn't want to risk having Op say no so they didn't bring it up until they got there and it would be awkward to say no.", "NTA. Nobody should ever assume they are staying over at your place without confirming with you first - that's incredibly rude of them!", "They never asked about staying with you, right?\n\nDid you invite them to come and visit? I'm just trying to understand where the confusion would have happened.\n\nIf you asked them to come and visit, I get the issue. There is an underlying social invitation there, where ideally you would clarify \"I'd love to see you but I realize the cost of a hotel for the visit would be a lot so I get it might not make sense.\"\n\nBut even if you said, it would be great if you came out- that would be on them.

I am amazed an adult would go on a two week trip without confirming arrangements. This is not something that should be assumed. That's nutty behaviour indeed. But if you suspected that they might want to stay at yours, you should have asked the hotel question before they arrived. I find it nearly improbable that you made all these plans and never had a clue they figured they would stay at yours.", "ESH - Everyone involved made assumptions about a major aspect of this entire trip without talking about it. Yes, you're not obligated to let them stay with you, and they aren't entitled to stay there, but would it really be so bad to put a mattress down when you literally can to do a favor for your friends who traveled to see you? If so, then don't it, but I don't think your friendship will be the same after this. Based on James, he might say this is the end of the friendship.", "ESH.

I mean, do you know how much it's going to cost them to book two weeks of hotel at the last minute?\n\nYou're kind of a shitty host and I would probably go home and not visit you again if you did this to me.

If you know them, why would you be worried about them stealing or being in the same space as you sleep? That's not very fair to them.\nIs knowingly being neurotic a good reason to behave this way? Is choosing not to try to be less neurotic acceptable?\nThis is a question I cannot answer for you. I am not in a position to judge it. Being neurotic doesn't make you bad, but I also don't think it's a helpful trait to have in excess. \nBetter communication, as others have said, would have prevented this.

They are now in a situation where they\u2019re stuck paying a huge amount of money to visit *you*. You could help out financially or be more flexible and allow them to stay at least a few nights.

The reason was his cousins, and the fact that they would spy on me when my husband worked out of town. They would tell him all kinds of lies and when he came back to town, we would fight. So we moved away to get away from the pressures of his family lying to him.\n\nLife was great in california, but he kept telling these people that they could visit anytime they wanted. I knew they didn't have a lot of money and kind of thought they would never visit us. But, one day, chugging up the street came an ancient rv. It pulled into our driveway. And out of it got, I kid you not, 11 people! Three generations from the elderly grandmother to the nephews of his cousins. And they had come to stay with us. Yay.\n\nI wanted to know who the fuck gave them our address. \n\nApparently, they had gotten a very large tax refund that year and wanted to use it to go to the amusement parks that were all around us. You know, disneyland, Magic Mountain, Knott's Berry farm. Okay, I was all for that. Go to the amusement parks and go home.\n\nAt first they stayed in a hotel about a mile from us. I was very relieved because I did not want them in my house. We didn't have any living room furniture yet. We had only lived there a few months. But, the day came when the \"leader\" of this group, who weighs over 300 pounds, discovered that he was too big to ride most of the rides at the parks. Especially the roller coasters, the ones he really wanted to ride the most.\n\nSelfish asshole that he was, he decided that if he couldn't go to the parks and ride the roller coasters, nobody could. So the plans changed. The money was no longer allocated to parks and fun. They stayed in the hotel for about 2 weeks and the money started to run out. Then, they moved into our house. Literally. Since they were low on money they made arrangements to have the grandmother's and the wife's (of the 300 lb asshole) Social Security checks mailed to our address so that they would have some more money to work with. I wish they had just gone home.\n\nMy husband was a truck driver and subject to random drug tests. That didn't matter to any of them. Life at our house became very similar to their life at home. Get up in the morning, go out and buy a large amount of pot, sit around and let \"leader of the pack\" dole it out in bong hits like candy to trick-or-treaters. When that pot ran out, they'd go buy more.\n\nI was furious when I discovered my husband had taken some of our money to go in on the pot. He used money needed for bills. His excuse was that he had to contribute so he could have some. \"Besides,\" he told me rudely. \"I'm earning it, not you!\" Gee, I wonder where that wisdom-filled platitude came from. \ud83d\ude12 No, I told him. They were staying at our house, using our water to shower, and I was cooking huge meals to feed them. Of course that didn't fly. They made a huge deal out of being \"insulted\" that I \"made them feel unwelcome.\" And they stopped showering except a couple of times when they trooped en masse to a local truck stop to use free showers my husband had accumulated with fuel points. They still ate us out of house and home. \n\nI knew that my husband had to go back to work and take a load out to Texas. I was really hoping they'd leave. They didn't. The day I knew he was due to leave, he and all of our adult \"guests\" except the elderly grandmother disappeared. I kept expecting him to come say goodbye to me, but late that afternoon I discovered that he had left with them that morning, saying nothing to me. Since I was so \"disrespectful\" to them, I didn't deserve a kiss goodbye or even an acknowledgment from my husband. Yeah. \n\nI was pissed but decided to deal with it when he got back. In the meantime I had 4 little boys and a little girl who were bored. Their parents never gave them any enrichment. I set grandma up with the baby for the day, bundled those kids into my truck and took them to the Griffith park observatory. It was free admission, and these kids had never seen anything like it.\n\nI went from \"the bitch who didn't like them\" to \"auntie who can tell us about all this cool stuff,\" at least for a few hours. They did all the interactive things they could and we saw a small star/light show. They loved it! They had so much fun! We ordered pizza and played some games to keep them occupied the rest of the time I had them. They talked nonstop about the observatory for days, until the adults came home.\n\nAs the kids excitedly told them what they had seen and done, I saw all the adults' eyes turn cold and resentful. Did I get a \"thank you for watching our kids and keeping them entertained? Oh hell no! Instead I heard,\" you know, you're a real asshole! You wait until we leave to take the kids to see something like that. Why didn't you wait for all of us to get back?\" Even my husband was pissed at me!\n\nI told them. \"You did not ask my permission to go off and leave your kids with me. You didn't even tell me you were leaving! They were bored. I took them to do something fun, which by the way I suggested we all do a week ago and you said it sounded stupid!\" I told them we could all go again and the kids were all for it. \"No! You ruined it now! Fuck you!\" Yeah, that's what I got for watching their kids (for 5 days) and helping them to have fun. Then they yelled at grandma for letting me take the kids, and made her cry. But, I was the asshole.\n\nI said, \"if you didn't want me to take them anywhere, why didn't you tell me instead of sneaking out like that? You knew I would say no to watching them.\" Apparently I should have known better. Yeah, nobody ever takes visiting kids in their charge off to do fun things. I was out of line. /s\n\nAnyway, that proved to be the last straw with me as far as they were concerned. I could not be trusted, my attitude was shitty and I could no longer be tolerated. They left two days later, still in a huff over the observatory. \n\n***THANK FUCKING GOD!***\n\nThey had been there a month.\n\nIt took me about a week to get my ex to admit that he'd given them permission to come. Before that he insisted he was as surprised as me to see them. As far as other shit he pulled, I guess you know why he's an ex. \n\nGirl, stick to your guns. Don't let people stay in your house.

You never once asked what area of town they\u2019d be staying in? \n\n\nI also don\u2019t like people staying with me, but if my friends showed up and there was that miscommunication, I wouldn\u2019t expect them to get a hotel especially because were in our mid 20\u2019s and don\u2019t have money like that\u2026 Also, to each their own, but if you can\u2019t even let a significant other stay at your house, this problem may be OCD (I have it too so no judgment) because that\u2019s 100% going to affect your quality of life and future relationships and become a problem. I would honestly suggest that you seek out a professional who specializes in stuff like that", "Nope, I'm accommodating af, but don't come here for 2 weeks unless I told you it's ok. Some of my friends don't even stop by unannounced, even after telling them that they can.", "If they can't afford a hotel, then at the very least they need to ASK if they can stay over at someone's house. I love when my friends visit me, and for 1-2 nights, it is fun with them staying in my home (because I OFFER that and we discuss it ahead of time), but it disrupts everyone in the home's schedule, including the dog, so having people longer than that is not really feasible. It's not because I don't love my friends, it's because who I am as a person needs way more space/alone time than others. Do not guilt OP for knowing what their limits are. NTA", "That's cool and all that you would do that but she's not comfortable with it and she pays the bills. I don't even expect to stay with my brother when I go and visit. I either get a hotel room or stay with my best friend because I know my brother is weird about having overnight guests. Our mother doesn't even stay with him.", "A social norm can be violated. A norm just means something the majority like to do. That doesnt mean you have to do it that way. And her friends KNOW her boundaries and that they dont conform to the norm. Violating boundaries is worse than violating social norms.", "I'm mid 40s. In my 20s, I'd have allowed /assumed guest would stay over and vice versus. Now, it definitely wouldn't be an assumption either way, and I'd much rather get a hotel myself.

Everyone is different, but I know quite a few my age that feel the same.", "I'm 35 and I would hire movers now but I always invite friends to stay at my place if they are visiting. I encourage it even. That's the whole purpose of having a guest room.", "Absolutely. They all needed to communicate more clearly. It\u2019s sad, but hopefully they can all grow through it instead of fracture.", "Considering OP won't answer that question, the answer is yes", "Because she never changes her mind and she hasn't put it in writing yet?", "It absolutely is a nightmare for an introvert. I once said that in a pinch a friend can stay with me while she finds other accommodations, and a couple weeks later she was asking when she could move in. Not if, *when*. And her idea of adequate time to prepare was 3 weeks. Evidently she and her previous roommate were not getting along and she wasn't officially on the lease, so she was the one to go.\n\nSo I've had my rather extroverted friend from high school living out of my guest room for the last 6 months, and it has been a challenge. Her cleaning  standards are significantly lower than mine, she brought five cats with her, and she's often up till 2:00 in the morning talking to her girlfriend that lives several states away.", "That is what good friends typically do when they Come to visit a friend. **but not without talking about the accommodation first tho**. \n\nOP is definetly not the asshole, THO her reasonings show  0 trust considering she is talking about her close friends. I personally couldnt consider anyone close, if I had to be scared that they might steal from me etc.", "Many would be happy with friends staying for TWO WEEKS since the trip was specifically to see OP. It's not like they were planning to do mainly couples things and were only trying to use OP for freebies. \n\nThese people all lack planning and social skills. It is bizarre that the friends never confirmed with OP that they could stay. They all extensively discussed activities but accommodations never once came up? In OP's shoes, I would definitely have offered hotel suggestions to make it clear in a somewhat subtle way that friends should not expect to stay with me during the planning stage.", "Are these two people strangers or are they close friends traveling from out of state specifically to spend those two weeks with you?", "Any 25 year old who has a spare mattress AND a \u201chobbies room\u201d is not living in a small city apartment.", "I invited a friend to town for a wine festival weekend and they still ASKED if they could stay at my place.

Especially when you **know** that they've never been okay with it in the past?\n\nIt's the visiting couple who has failed here. They knew that OP did not host overnight visitors, but they just hoped they could show up and guilt-trip her into giving in.\n\n\"Friends\" who would do something like that are friends I would seriously consider dropping.", "Right? Mid 30\u2019s is when you actually have space to host your visiting friends.

It doesn't sound like it (certainly not to her tiny 1 bedroom apt). The OP states that these people \"decided to travel to the city where I live,\" not that she invited them.", "I have a lot of empathy for OP. I\u2019m also hyper-private and do not like having guests, much less out of town overnight company. I get it \u2014 I am creeped out by the idea of someone being in my home or touching my stuff when I\u2019m away. I\u2019ve had to work (HARD) at it, but as I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve forced myself to be more willing to have overnight guests (not for 2 weeks, but for a few nights). I\u2019m still not100% comfortable with it, but I\u2019ve just come to accept that it\u2019s a social norm I need to make peace with to preserve some special relationships. OP, I just want you to know that I get it and that at some point your position on this may change.\n\nThat said, I do think these two friends absolutely are gaslighting her. They knew she\u2019d say no, that they\u2019d be stuck with a big hotel bill, and they decided that they. would just act like everyone assumed they\u2019d be staying at OP\u2019s place all along and make it really awkward and uncomfortable for OP to say no, to basically bully her into providing their crash pad. They purposely and deliberately didn\u2019t have the conversation with her. I\u2019m proud of her for standing her ground.", "They absolutely assumed she'd cave. Air BnBs are very reasonable and for them to not even try shows their entitlement. If I was the OP id let them go home.

And her kids dont live at home anymore so they were all available. I practically grew up at her house. Shes more of a mom to me in some ways than my actual mom. She tells people Im the daughter she never had.  I *still* checked with her about staying with her before we even got plane tickets.

So it's irrelevant.", "There's a difference between being kind and empathetic when communicating forthrightly and some passive round about tip toeing. Being direct--where do you plan to stay?

It's the unwritten trade-off we've made: I'm the one who always travels to visit her, not the other way around, because of my more flexible schedule/life, while she's the one who hosts. The only reason I ever visit this particular area is to see her, anyway. The last time I visited, we just stayed at home the entire time and played board games and watched movies. Visits are usually about two weeks long since I'm traveling halfway across the country. The last time I stayed for \"only\" a week and she lamented that it was too short lol. \n\nOf course, it doesn't sound like OP has a similarly close relationship with the friends in question here!

Don't like your friend's answer then dont visit.", "OP mentioned they are neurotic about people in her home. \n\nThey may or may not have some sort of OCD or paranoia related thing but that is irrelevant. \n\nPeople are allowed to be weird.

OP is clear NTA here. \n\n>But OP doesn\u2019t have severe PTSD (she would have stated so)\n\nNo, there is no reason why she would. A simple \"I do not want people to stay overnight in my home\" is enough. You don't need to provide a reason. \"No\" is a complete sentence.", "Yeah I'm thinking they didn't bring it up on purpose.

This failure to communicate is a 2 way street.  It was very presumptive of the friends to just assume they would stay with OP, especially given the self admitted neurotic tendencies that are apparently wel known.
