We keep contact via texting and video calls but we've never seen each other face-to-face since they moved. They decided to travel to the city I live in so we can spend time together. We had all choosen a lot of things to do in the 2 weeks they're supposed to spend here. The conflict is that I don't want them to stay at my aparrment (like, sleep there overnight) while they're here, but they don't have family or other friends in this state or close by that they can stay with which means they'd have to pay for a hotel. A day ago, when they arrived, we were talking and I asked them which hotel they picked. They were confused and Ana (26F) asked what I meant. They thought they were going to stay at my apartment with me. We hadn't discussed where they would stay before they came here, and I assumed they knew they were going to stay at a hotel since they have never stayed at my home like that and they know I don't let anyone stay over like that. Not even my parents or my boyfriend. They said they thought I had changed my mind about these things, but I never said I had, they just assumed I did. I live at an apartment alone and even though there isn't a guest room I have my old mattress that I could put on the living room or on my hobbies's room, or they could sleep on the couch. But I refused to do so and to pay or help pay for the hotel. They're both very annoyed with me and think I'm being selfish but James (25M) is furious. He thinks I am being ridiculous. Ana accepted to pay but James wants to either go back or make me let them stay in my apartment. They're staying at a hotel at the moment and we didn't do what we planned to yesterday. Ana texted me that she's trying to convince James to stay in the hotel, and maybe she will but nonetheless they both think I should change my mind.\n\nThe reason I don't want them, or anyone, to stay over is because it makes me very uncomfortable to have someone in my home while I am asleep or not there. I hate the ideia of someone touching my things without my permission or seeing something I'd rather they not see, or even stealing something. And they know that, but thought I had become more lenient about it.\n\nI asked my parents and other friends what they think and the general consensus is that it would be nice of me to let them stay but since I am know to be quite neurotic between our friends and family and it's not like I told them I changed my view nor implied they would stay, I wouldn't be in the wrong if I don't allow it.", "created_utc": 1686243672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144eq8h/aita_for_not_letting_my_friends_stay_over_at_my/", "score": 1004, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nah, I think they didn't want to risk having Op say no so they didn't bring it up until they got there and it would be awkward to say no.", "NTA. Nobody should ever assume they are staying over at your place without confirming with you first - that's incredibly rude of them!", "They never asked about staying with you, right?\n\nDid you invite them to come and visit? I'm just trying to understand where the confusion would have happened.\n\nIf you asked them to come and visit, I get the issue. There is an underlying social invitation there, where ideally you would clarify \"I'd love to see you but I realize the cost of a hotel for the visit would be a lot so I get it might not make sense.\"\n\nBut even if you said, it would be great if you came out- that would be on them.

They know you don't do guests and didn't ask the obvious question about housing. Maybe because they were hoping you would feel guilty and just give in. Who knows. It doesn't matter.\n\nThe polite thing to do might be to offer to help Ana look online for an inexpensive place for her to stay.

I am amazed an adult would go on a two week trip without confirming arrangements. This is not something that should be assumed. That's nutty behaviour indeed. But if you suspected that they might want to stay at yours, you should have asked the hotel question before they arrived. I find it nearly improbable that you made all these plans and never had a clue they figured they would stay at yours.", "ESH - Everyone involved made assumptions about a major aspect of this entire trip without talking about it. Yes, you're not obligated to let them stay with you, and they aren't entitled to stay there, but would it really be so bad to put a mattress down when you literally can to do a favor for your friends who traveled to see you? If so, then don't it, but I don't think your friendship will be the same after this. Based on James, he might say this is the end of the friendship.", "ESH. WHY wouldn't you all talk about this beforehand??

I mean, do you know how much it's going to cost them to book two weeks of hotel at the last minute?\n\nYou're kind of a shitty host and I would probably go home and not visit you again if you did this to me.

If you know them, why would you be worried about them stealing or being in the same space as you sleep? That's not very fair to them.\nIs knowingly being neurotic a good reason to behave this way? Is choosing not to try to be less neurotic acceptable?\nThis is a question I cannot answer for you. I am not in a position to judge it. Being neurotic doesn't make you bad, but I also don't think it's a helpful trait to have in excess. \nBetter communication, as others have said, would have prevented this.

They are now in a situation where they\u2019re stuck paying a huge amount of money to visit *you*. You could help out financially or be more flexible and allow them to stay at least a few nights.

Ultimately it's their responsibility to confirm their trip and what they were doing.

That sounds exhausting!", "If you're asking someone to travel to see you, then it's *extremely* normal and expected for there to be some level of reciprocation in grown up friendships.  Either helping with costs, picking up the tab for food, tickets to see something, etc.  Travel is expensive and having someone come visit you is a BIG favor to ask for.", "That's all fair. I think the issue for me comes in where they are the one doing the traveling, and OP couldn't even be bothered to do the work to confirm all of this as the one in the \"host\" city. \n\nI would be mortified, but I have always operated under the assumption that the one not traveling goes to extra effort to ensure the ones who do have a good trip. Maybe it's because I'm over 10 years older than OP but that has always been normal in my circles.\n\nI stand by my \"ESH\" but you make good points!", "No, it's incredible normal. Good friends always offer you to stay with them. Especially if you have the spacem i live in Kansas, none of my friends or family live here m when they visit, they stay with me, no questions asked. Because they would and have done the same when i visit. \n\nI say ESH for the lack of communication. OP needed to set better and more explicit boundaries. And both parties should have confirmed plans before commiting to the trip. \n\nBut it's completely normal for people to offer their homes to friends and family visiting.

I pretty much assume that when people say they\u2019re coming to my town for a visit and there\u2019s no other reason to be there, that they intend to stay with me. OP has definitely failed in the sense that she didn\u2019t say anything to them because of her assumption of them already knowing she was like this. Especially because two weeks is a LONG time to be either staying in your home/paying for accommodations. I know for a fact I\u2019d not want my friends to stay in my apartment for a full two weeks and would say that.

Hell, i let my best friend stay at my house, known this dude since i was 8 (was 24 at the time) and he lasted one week before my husband caught him in our closet touching and taking our things. This was my best best friend, stood on my side when i got married, held my first born before family did, i trusted him with my LIFE. And he did me wrong.

Not so much when older.", "I can't imagine automatically assuming that I'm just staying with someone. I always check and often, the other person offers first. \n\nWhen I was a kid, my grandparents lived in Minnesota, about 1000 miles away. Any time my family would visit, there was a 50-50 chance we would stay at their house or in a hotel. My dad just didn't want to burden his parents (even if my grandma lived for hosting).

If I\u2019m going to stay with my best friend since childhood or her family, I\u2019m not even going to ask because I know they\u2019d be actually offended at the idea of not hosting me and would say it would be ridiculous for me to spend money on a hotel while there. But then again, I\u2019ve also visited them multiple times for trips of varying lengths and even when my best friend lived locally in a 1 bedroom we still shared her queen bed just like we did as kids.", "Yeah, I\u2019m not risking not having proper accommodations.", "I sorta assume I can stay at my parents house when visiting there (even if they aren't in town or I'll be spending most of my time with friends), but always double check.

It is possible that some of the conversations you had about this trip implied you are hosting them, even though you didn\u2019t initiate the invitation first. Social cues can be complicated, that is why both sides should have talked about where are they going to spend their nights. This aside, if you consider somebody a close friend, but don\u2019t trust them to spend a night at your house, that is a problem you will have to address on your end.

Honestly, if they are coming to the city specifically to see you, and you invited them or were welcoming, I could definitely see how they might think there was an implied invitation there, and the assumption that you'd have changed would be, 'Huh, she never really used to let people stay over, but looks like she's making an exception since we're coming to see her.' The anger is coming from having to find a hotel at the last minute - which is waaaayyyy harder and more expensive than if they'd booked it in advance, or budgeted for it.
