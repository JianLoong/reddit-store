My family is kinda split on who's right or wrong here. Names changed for the story. This is POV my aunt.   \n\nWe were having a family BBQ for the 4th of July.  I had a bake ziti in the oven and my son (13m), Mark,  was sitting in the kitchen scrolling on his phone. I asked him to take the ziti out when the oven beeps cuz a guest was lost so I had to stand out front to wait for them. When they arrived we chat for a while out front before heading inside.  \n\nWhen we went in something smelled burnt. I check the kitchen and Mark isn't in there but the pasta is burnt. Not too badly but the bottom layer was crunchy and burnt. Mark came out from the bathroom with his phone in his hand. I assume he was in the bathroom playing on his phone. He claims he didn't hear the oven beep but if he wasn't in the bathroom playing on his phone for so long he would've heard it and it wouldn't have been burnt. \n\nI ask for his phone and tell him to go up to his bedroom and I'd come get him when he can have his phone back. He turns and runs upstairs with his phone. I call out for him to bring his phone back and he ignores me. I excuse myself and tell our guests to wait in the living room or out back with the rest of the party.  \n\nI follow him upstairs and knock on his door. No answer. I try to open it but he has it locked.  \"Mark, I'm gunna take your phone for the whole night if you don't give it to me right now.\" Still no answer but I hear him muttering to himself. \"MARK!?\" I knock on his door louder. I hear his damn playstation turn on and that  made me so mad I started kicking his door til the lock broke open. He had his headset on like he was about to play videogames . I turn his TV off and demand his phone. He shouts about his broken door but I don't care. I make him hand over his phone and his playstation controllers.  Now he has no phone or games or lock on the door til I say so.  \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for breaking down my son's door? \n.\n{EDIT} \nI think I need to clarify that this story is of the POV (point of view) of my aunt not me. My aunt broke the door down of her own house of her son's bedroom while they were both upstairs.  Everyone, including myself, was downstairs and could hear what was happening. \nI plan on showing my aunt and cousin some of the comments after this post has reached its verdict.", "created_utc": 1689189450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xxure/aita_for_breaking_down_my_sons_door/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, the violence was directed at an inanimate object, but it is still asshole behavior. You could have either picked the lock, used tools to take the door off its hinges, or better yet, waited for the kid to come out before giving him consequences for his actions, which would have been more severe than before due to the door locking behavior.", "YTA - this is scary behaviour from a parent. \n\nHow can you expect a child to grow up respectful and well adjusted when this is how you (or your aunt) behave", "NTA - more kids could use a parent like you. If you truly did all you could and he was just completely ignoring you when he knows he was wrong, you\u2019re right to force the issue imo. \n\nMaybe put new locks on the doors with a master key. That way you can allow privacy like the kid should have but also not trigger the internet strangers or cops that would view your kicked in door as domestic violence. \n\n100% that kid needs to have privileges removed for a while until he learns to respect real life and be a team player with his family.", "YTA for being so out of control that you felt it necessary to kick your son's door until it broke.\n\nYou need anger management.", "NTA (if this is an isolated incident) \n\nI\u2019m seeing some misguided therapy language being used to describe this scenario. \n1.

I don't think being the first one to escalate to physical violence when dealing with a 13 year old is a great idea- and kicking in a door is still violence, it still sends the message to a kid that \"Instead of a door, this could be you.\"  But, at least, nobody kicked down a door in somebody **else's** house.\n\nIn general, if your parenting technique requires you to demonstrate your physical strength, you probably failed at using your words very well.

The results of letting this go are far worse. \n\nYou can\u2019t parent a kid if they\u2019re just ignoring you. It is necessary to enforce punishments for bad behaviour.
