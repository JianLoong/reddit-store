It sounds as though he could be depressed or going through something he doesn't currently feel safe talking to you about. I suggest trying to talk to him from a place of concern and compassion, that you've noticed he's in these moods and you're concerned about his mental health, does he need help. He may think you don't care right now, and it's hard to pull oneself out of a funk like that, often when your brain is telling you everyone hates you.
