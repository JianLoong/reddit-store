{"id": 28497, "submission_id": "1730lj6", "title": "AITA for calling my friend out for assuming that i will pay his food?", "selftext": "Hi all\n\nYesterday I (28M) went out with some friends. One particular friend of mine (27m) is always broke and hugely indebted to a bunch of different friends, but mainly his parents (more than 10k \u20ac in debt to various different people.) \n\nThis friend also owes me money, which he said he would pay at the end of the month, which was last May. The debt has only increased since then. The debt has increased cause I at one point lent him a few bucks for food, and also cause he has consistently shown up to our meet-ups with less money that he thought he had, or where he actually lost the money out of his pocket. This sounds suspicious, but i believe it is true, since he is a very \u201cdistracted\u201d person.\n\nNow this all may sound pety. To clear things, i do not mind giving food to a friend who is broke. Since the \u201cloan\u201d in May there have been multiple times where i gave him food that i didnt account for. And often it is due to him making an assumption like: \u201cYou gave  the Kebab, right?\u201d or \u201cThanks for the beers\u201d even though i did not plan for charity. \n\nHe either assumes i give the food or that the food gets added to his \u201cloan\u201d. Even though he gives no clarity at all towards paying the money back. \n\nNow this happened yesterday. We went out for drinks and went for a burger while waiting for another friend. While ordering, he said: \u201cmind if i go the the bathroom\u201d and then i paid for the food. Later we went to a bar, i paid for a round and  said: \u201cSo next round is on you, right?\u201d (I was a bit annoyed). Whereafter he becomes extremely defensive and says: \u201cYou know i have no money, why do you have to bring that up?\u201d I answered that i didnt know it, as he shamefully hides it, and asked what about the burgers? He got even more triggered and started calling me pety and rude for \u201cintently belittling him\u201d\n\nI said it was frustrating that he never said a word and took people for granted and this let to a big argument. \n\nI understand that the shame and economical stress probably limits him from saying these things out loud, but it results in people feeling robbed/disrespected. \n\nBtw. His debt is not due to major investments, but due to small loans from friends for food, smokes, weed etc and it has been building up over many years. He casually assumes people will give him stuff or at worst lent it to him and never brings it up unless confronted, he gets very triggered and defensive and every month he borrows more money and digs a deeper hole. \n\nI am honestly concerned for him, cause i see him suffer and he acts around money in a fashion that does not fit his giving spirit. I fear he has \u201cdebt addiction\u201d and i dont know how to reach him when he gets so defensive. I also feel that i am not helping him, but lenting him money. \n\nSorry for this way too long thread in advance! \n\nAITA for overinvolving myself into someone elses personal issues or am i simply too pety?", "created_utc": 1696775564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1730lj6/aita_for_calling_my_friend_out_for_assuming_that/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
