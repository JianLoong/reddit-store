{"id": 28497, "submission_id": "1730lj6", "title": "AITA for calling my friend out for assuming that i will pay his food?", "selftext": "Hi all\n\nYesterday I (28M) went out with some friends. One particular friend of mine (27m) is always broke and hugely indebted to a bunch of different friends, but mainly his parents (more than 10k \u20ac in debt to various different people.) \n\nThis friend also owes me money, which he said he would pay at the end of the month, which was last May. The debt has only increased since then. The debt has increased cause I at one point lent him a few bucks for food, and also cause he has consistently shown up to our meet-ups with less money that he thought he had, or where he actually lost the money out of his pocket. This sounds suspicious, but i believe it is true, since he is a very \u201cdistracted\u201d person.\n\nNow this all may sound pety. To clear things, i do not mind giving food to a friend who is broke. Since the \u201cloan\u201d in May there have been multiple times where i gave him food that i didnt account for. And often it is due to him making an assumption like: \u201cYou gave  the Kebab, right?\u201d or \u201cThanks for the beers\u201d even though i did not plan for charity. \n\nHe either assumes i give the food or that the food gets added to his \u201cloan\u201d. Even though he gives no clarity at all towards paying the money back. \n\nNow this happened yesterday. We went out for drinks and went for a burger while waiting for another friend. While ordering, he said: \u201cmind if i go the the bathroom\u201d and then i paid for the food. Later we went to a bar, i paid for a round and  said: \u201cSo next round is on you, right?\u201d (I was a bit annoyed). Whereafter he becomes extremely defensive and says: \u201cYou know i have no money, why do you have to bring that up?\u201d I answered that i didnt know it, as he shamefully hides it, and asked what about the burgers? He got even more triggered and started calling me pety and rude for \u201cintently belittling him\u201d\n\nI said it was frustrating that he never said a word and took people for granted and this let to a big argument. \n\nI understand that the shame and economical stress probably limits him from saying these things out loud, but it results in people feeling robbed/disrespected. \n\nBtw. His debt is not due to major investments, but due to small loans from friends for food, smokes, weed etc and it has been building up over many years. He casually assumes people will give him stuff or at worst lent it to him and never brings it up unless confronted, he gets very triggered and defensive and every month he borrows more money and digs a deeper hole. \n\nI am honestly concerned for him, cause i see him suffer and he acts around money in a fashion that does not fit his giving spirit. I fear he has \u201cdebt addiction\u201d and i dont know how to reach him when he gets so defensive. I also feel that i am not helping him, but lenting him money. \n\nSorry for this way too long thread in advance! \n\nAITA for overinvolving myself into someone elses personal issues or am i simply too pety?", "created_utc": 1696775564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1730lj6/aita_for_calling_my_friend_out_for_assuming_that/", "score": 308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Warn him that even if it\u2019s somewhere like a restaurant where you don\u2019t pay up front, he must bring cash instead of a card, and give you the cash right when he orders. If you hang out at home, he brings the weed/alcohol/takeout or you guys don\u2019t have any. Have this talk PRIVATELY AT HOME to minimize the embarrassment that causes him to get defensive. He still will, and it\u2019s not cool even if he\u2019s embarrassed, but at least this will make him more likely to listen.\n\nMake it clear that you are willing to hang out somewhere free, or if he\u2019s broke just somewhere cheaper to account for that. But that you don\u2019t have the money to keep floating him, and that you won\u2019t be lending him more until he starts paying it back. \n\nI\u2019ve been there with being so overwhelmed by debt that you almost feel paralyzed and it is constantly a huge anxious weight. It can feel like too much to even address.\n\nOr honestly, it sometimes felt like \u201conce I pay off this thing I\u2019ll be good\u201d, and then it keeps piling up\u2014 many of us fall into the trap of feeling like we have to pay everything off at once which makes it harder. No idea why, just a lot of brains work like that. It\u2019s not at all an excuse to not pay people back, but might make it easier to figure out how to deal with him. \n\nSo I think you should talk to him about not paying it back all in one payment. You\u2019ll never get it back that way. Him saying he\u2019d \u201cpay back at the end of the month\u201d suggests he\u2019s trying to do that \u201cpaying back all at once\u201d thing, which doesn\u2019t work when you\u2019re broke. So get him on a payment plan, in writing (text works), to pay back a little a time\u2026 it\u2019ll suck to not get it all quickly, but you have a better chance of actually getting it back. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about him like you say in the post, so you don\u2019t want to come across as too mean or punishing, maybe you should let him know you\u2019re here if he wants to talk. I wouldn\u2019t tell him you\u2019re worried that he has a \u201cdebt addiction\u201d, cause honestly that would be kind of rude to tell him. Just tell him in a private place (like definitely at home) that you know he\u2019s broke and struggling, and ask if he wants to talk about it. Say that you know he\u2019s probably overwhelmed by all the money pressure, and tell him that you understand and want to help him emotionally if he needs it. Still make it clear that you can\u2019t help financially. \n\nBut if you really want to step in to help with his stuff overall because you\u2019re worried (which you have ZERO obligation to do or offer), you could help him come up with a budget and a payment plan for paying off debt. It\u2019s a huge relief to sit down with someone to help you figure a plan for something out that seems overwhelming. My bank lets you have multiple bank accounts for your one customer account, which takes two seconds to set up online. He can set up one section for bills, one for weekly spending, (this will be the one attached to his bank card), and one for extra money. Once he figures out a budget, he can figure out how much money per paycheck he would need to pay necessities/a spending budget (if he budgets too harshly, he\u2019ll just go over it habitually, so sectioning out spending money is important). For a weekly paycheck put a quarter of a month\u2019s worth of spending & bills in each, then everything else goes in the extra. Once he pays rent (to be safe), then he can portion out the extra for debt repayment each month.\n\nAnd in the future, I have a policy: Don\u2019t lend out more than you\u2019re willing to lose, and don\u2019t lend out money if you need it back by a certain time. If someone borrows from you, make it clear that they won\u2019t be receiving anything else from you until they pay it back (or at least start). If they don\u2019t pay back within a couple months, never let them borrow again. Learned this policy from a friend and it\u2019s helped a ton! \n\nI understand the want to help him cover stuff here and there, but he\u2019s going to just keep doing it. So for now at least, he pays up front or meets for something free, and he goes on a payment plan. Sorry you\u2019re being taken advantage of\u2014 I know you don\u2019t want to be a dick who won\u2019t help a friend.
