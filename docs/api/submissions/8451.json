I'd be more sympathetic when schools were shut for the pandemic, but the older kids could be off at school now for part of the day and give mom a break. Even the younger ones could go to preschool or smart start, or even a daycare one or two days a week. \"Oh mom will take care of all the kids all the time\" is NOT an adequate childcare strategy when you're planning a family.", "Maybe I\u2019m too nice and naive, I\u2019m going to give her the benefit of doubly and guess that 10 years ago when the first was born, she was younger, more energetic and healthier.

And I can see that though she likely worsened over the years, she couldn\u2019t imagine not \u201csticking to the plan\u201d of 4 kids plus homeschooling. However, now that she\u2019s obviously quite ill and her husband is an asshole, she should really send the older two to school. It\u2019s (likely) free and would give her a huge break.

Paying for a babysitter is a better option than hubby calling out sick. FMLA saves his job,  but many sales jobs are commission only - meaning he has to produce and work to get paid.

I worked for two separate companies which had opposite methods.  First was employee sick days only and sick kids was vacation day.  Second job was specifically listed as employee or family sick days and you could take both.

Those who do, though, can almost universally use it to take care of sick dependents, and generally sick family members as well, I believe.\n\nIf the company's sick policy allows it, I definitely think it's reasonable for OP to ask her husband to take sick days to take care of her on her worst days (which implicitly would include taking care of the kids as well).

The hospital isn't going to do much of anything for you, because you're not in danger of dying; you know perfectly well what's wrong with you. In fact, if you do go to the hospital every time you feel this bad, you risk gain a reputation as a time-wasting patient and having much worse trouble if and when you actually do need emergency care, because \"feeling this bad\" is going to happen somewhat regularly.

Use the sick days that he loses every year; or 2. Hire some help.\n\nI think using the sick days is perfectly legitimate. No one would question a woman using these days for her children or a sick spouse or her ailing parents. People just accept that this is what women do. It is not unreasonable for your husband to use them in a similar way. He\u2019s not using them to get out of work, and while many commenters here seem to think doing so would endanger your livelihood, his family IS his responsibility. Responsibility doesn\u2019t stop with a paycheck. And it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that he could even do some level of remote work while you are ill. The workplace has changed since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIf he\u2019s not willing to do this, that\u2019s fine as he is the one holding the job, but he needs to budget for outside help. It\u2019s admittedly more complicated given that you can\u2019t predict when you will be ill, but if he\u2019s not willing to step in, someone else has to do so.\n\nYou are not unreasonable for demanding what a paid worker would automatically be permitted. Honestly (in the US, anyway) workers are given the absolute minimum consideration, basically enough to prevent lawsuits. \n\nIf you staying at home was a mutual decision, all that you ask is fair. If you come from a traditional gender role background where it was assumed you would stay home, definitely dig in your heels.

Don't fuck with the husband's job.", "This! It would be so much more manageable to be a SAHP if they didn\u2019t homeschool.
