No. Am I saying you are less important to the success of the family? Not at all. It only works because of you.

Put some kids in school, or start a new policy where you homeschool for a few years but then they go to school in 4th grade or whatever. Hire a sitter or a mother's helper. Stop having babies. It helps to know that in XYZ years, you'll be past a very difficult stage. Know when you'll be ringing the curtain down on this lifestyle that you may very well love and that may be best for your family, but that undeniably takes all your strength.\n\nBTW, if you do hire a sitter or a mother's helper regularly, like a couple times per week, if you can afford it, you might be able to rest enough to make the other days better.
