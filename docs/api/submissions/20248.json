I am getting the vibe that you are from Asia. As in eastern culture the first child has much more responsibility. At the same time I think it is not fair and just stupid to put so much burden on a single child.

You're essentially the \"head of household\" by default. You're working like crazy to support a family that you didn't create or specifically choose (as compared to like a married couple with children, which is how I'd typically see this dynamic, in the U.S. anyway).  You've gotten injured and have been having a hard time with sleep.\n\nYour mother was made aware of the circumstances and still decided to wake you. Even if they cleaned, so what? I'm a SAHM, but I'm also big on the division of labor - including mental. Normally, I expect my husband to help with household things; childcare, etc. When he is home and able. BUT if he is sick, hurt, or just needs a BREAK, that's different. \n\nSomeone else should have gone. Or they should have ordered a delivery (if available). Or just waited. It was rude to wake you considering the circumstances. Unless you became violent or verbally abusive, I don't see how you're in the wrong. Even then, it would be an everyone sucks situation.", "NTA, you are working hard, shouldering a lot of responsibility by the sounds of it, and you made it clear that you must not be disturbed. As you have 2 other siblings, your mother could and should have asked them to do it, whether or not they had cleaned - that is irrelevent.
