Anyway, OP didn\u2019t want to go out and then decided to scream at her, tell her to \u201cget the eff out\u201d and then reveal private information in an attempt to humiliate her and alienate her from her friends. \n\nWow. Just wow OP. YTA. I suspect you are often with a hot head like that. That\u2019s unreal. Have you considered anger management and therapy? I\u2019m not snarking at you, I mean that very genuinely. You have some underlying issue with her, sounds like bitterness. Are you uncomfortable with your boyfriend hanging out with her? Is she an ex? What is going on here? I would never speak to you again, even if I hated her, because you can\u2019t be trusted and you can\u2019t control your anger.

I can\u2019t stand when people come to an event and then try to change it to shut their wants. But I honestly feel it is just a really shitty thing to do when arguing to bring up that everyone else secretly hates and talks shit about that person. It is a move designed to make someone feel like no one likes them, half the time people are exaggerating or sharing something those people never intended to convey publicly and it\u2019s just unnecessary.

She started to move the party to other place, where holder of the party and most important person of the day(for who came to her birthday( I consider it should be like that)) don\u2019t want to go.
