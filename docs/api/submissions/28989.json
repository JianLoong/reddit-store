I asked what happened and she said she had her period that day and it had stained her underwear and jeans very badly. \n\nI said that it's unhygienic to be washing period blood in the kitchen sink. If it was her own apartment then whatever, but especially since she has a housemate who uses the same kitchen to cook. Her roommate was away at the time and didn't know. I asked what his reaction would be and she said it could go either way. She also said that she didn't wash it in the bathroom sink because it's too small and the stain was too big. \n\nSo here's the question: Am I the asshole for being disgusted about her washing her period blood in the kitchen sink or is this normal?

To each their own of course, but I don't see the big deal if you can just clean the sink after you're done. \n\nA blood stain needs to be pre-treated, you gotta get in there and scrub, soak, etc. If the bathroom sink is too small, the only option besides the kitchen sink is a shower which is very impractical for the job.
