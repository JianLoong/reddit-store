She has been having trouble in school making friends, and she vents to me about it every day. I never know what to say, except for \"Sorry to hear that.\" I happen to be an introvert, so not having friends is kind of expected and not that much of a bother since I can get my daily dose of interaction through Reddit (kek). Yesterday, she came to my room (I live with her and my brother) to vent about it, and I asked her if she wanted me to be honest or to comfort her. She chose the truth, and I told her nobody owes her anything, and that nobody is obligated to be her friend for any reason. I told her she needs to respect that, or else it would be a very entitled way to go through life. I told her that nobody needs friends anyway because they can betray you, and we hugged.\n\nLater today, when she came home from school, she looked pretty happy so my brother asked if she made a new friend. She told me what I told her, except the way she said it made me look like a jerk. He sent her over to her grandpa's apartment downstairs, and my brother got back inside and started yelling and asking why I would say something like that to a little girl. I told him that I was just being honest, and that she is not entitled to friendships just because she demands them. He asked me where I got that mindset from, and I just kind of froze and said personal experience. He said I should consider staying the night with a friend because he did not even want to look at me. I told him I have none, and he said, \"I wonder why.\"\n\nSo with all that, I feel like I will set him off if I leave my room.

You're an AH for thinking that that's the whole truth here, the beginning and end of the conversation on this subject. And your \"nobody needs friends anyway because they can betray you\" belies your attempt to portray yourself as rational, indifferent, and sensible. You are none of these things . . . you are hurt, self-isolating, and avoiding human connection in order to avoid more hurt, and *you're an AH for trying to teach your trauma to a 9-year-old as though it were a healthy approach to life*. Until you can recognise and name your own vulnerabilities, you shouldn't be giving advice to other vulnerable people.\n\nYou're an AH because you told the truth but not the WHOLE truth. You told only the part of the truth that served your unhappy narrative. Because friends can betray you but they can also love and support you and lift you up, and provide strength when you're weak. And no one is obligated to be your niece's friend . . . but given that she seems like a lovely, kind child, *there's no reason why anyone should NOT be her friend, either*. And you didn't tell her THOSE parts of the whole. \n\nIf a child comes to you, trusts you, seeking connection and full of hope, and all you have to give them is your bitterness, and all you have to teach them is to give up hope, to isolate themselves and avoid even trying to seek human connection lest it not go ideally, then the child isn't the one broken, you are . . . you need therapy. And for your hurt, you are not an AH, but for trying to TEACH THAT BITTERNESS TO A CHILD seeking solace, then 100%, YTA.", "YTA. I kinda understand the first thing you said because, yes, we have to respect if people don't want to be our friends. You could have teach her how to be careful and not to do certain things just because someone calls themselves a friend. Stuff like that.\nInstead, you decided to be an ahole and say this:\n\n\n>nobody needs friends anyway because they can betray you, and we hugged.\n\nIt's always good to have someone outside from our family who we can rely upon, and shares interest and stuff with us.

What you did was insensitive and honestly, thoughtless. \n\nYour experiences are yours and not an accurate depiction of others. It is fine if you're happy to be the kind of person that has no friends, but not everyone wants to live that way and it certainly isn't healthy for most. \n\nIt just isn't appropriate.", "Honestly, you were half way there. You're right that nobody is entitled to someone else's friendship and that feeling that way is going to lead her through life being entitled and jaded when she doesn't get what she feels she's owed, but the resolution shouldn't be \"you don't want friends anyways because they'll only betray you,\" it should be \"work on becoming the kind of person people *want* to be friends with and on *making* friends, instead of worrying about what you are or aren't owed and just expecting to be given friends.\"\n\nIt sounds like a lesson you could do well to learn yourself.", "Holy heck\u2026.you don\u2019t lack friends because you\u2019re an introvert.

She's a 9 year old kid trying to learn how to fit in and make friends. You were not wrong, but that was phrased the way you would when speaking to an adult or at least an older teen.\n\nBeing the uncle and giving her advice is fine but you need to temper it in age appropriate ways.", "YTA\n\nThat was really your response to a 9-year-old who is having trouble making friends? To essentially tell her to give up and that friends are not worth anything anyway? What a terrible response. I don't care if she said she wanted the truth. She is 9. Didn't know what she was getting herself into and you shouldn't have put her in that position anyway. Friends are good and for most people, bring a lot happiness. You should not be discouraging her because of your own unresolved issues.", "YTA, especially for this:\n\n> I told her that nobody needs friends anyway because they can betray you", "YTA. She's 9. The hell is wrong with you?", "YTA - You gave her your perspective, but you're a young adult sharing a jaded view with a 9 year old child. As you grow older, you'll do best to remember that context and moderation are important. Betrayals and entitlement are concepts that most 9 year olds can recognize, but they can't articulate them like you can. \n\nDon't beat yourself up over this, but also tread lightly when giving life advice to a little kid.", "YTA cause you basically told her her needs/wants for socializing are wrong just because you don't seem to have them. It's like someone telling you they're really hungry cause they haven't eaten in days and you, not hungry, go on about how food is overhyped and not that important. It's not a great thing to invalidate other people's needs just because you can't relate.", "YTA\n\nYour brother was right, that is probably why you don't have friends. No one owes anyone friendship- this is true but you could have said to your niece \"not everyone is going to be your friend, and that's okay. you will find others who will be more like you and want to be your friend\" but you can't say that because it's not your experience. So what, are you staying at a hotel tonight?", "Well, the important lesson is you got to mansplain to a 9 year old girl, right?\n\nYTA.", ">I told her that nobody needs friends anyway because they can betray you\n\nThis isn't something that you tell a nine year old. YTA for this specifically.", "YTA: how the heck could you even consider saying that to a 9-year-old child?  Are you so miserable in life that you have to project it onto a 9-year-old child? Are you understanding what I'm saying?  \n\nYou're supposed to nurture children, not deter them.  Friendship is key growing up. People will hurt you yes, But it's not the end of the world.  You should take your brother's advice. Go outside and be around people. See human interaction.", "YTA- I don't have children, don't have the most amazing outlook on life, and am an introvert with not a lot of friends myself... but even I know there's a way to go about talking to a child about issues such as making friends. The way that you had gone about it is completely negative.  \nI have lived in that attitude for a good majority of my life and I'm not here to tell you not to believe what you want to believe, but by sharing this extremely negative \"advice\" you are now setting her up to be hurt and to expect it. She clearly showed that making friends was important to her in some aspect and may think the advice you gave her is helping, but in reality is actually not what she may have wanted.  \n\n\nI understand you wanted to help your niece and lay what you understand to be the truth of making friends down for her, but your wording needs to be chosen carefully. You can't deliver a one-sided aspect on life to someone so impressionable. She has her own paths to chose and telling her only one path to take could lead her in the wrong direction. You are not too much younger than me, but from your age to mine there are a lot of life lessons and developing that continue to happen through early adulthood. Here's an example of what I would have told her:  \n\n\n\"The truth is, not everyone will be your friend, but that's okay. You will find the right people for you if you continue to be yourself. You'll come across *a lot* of people you think are your friends, but not all of them will be your friend forever or always be nice. You just keep the ones who *really* care about you and love you. Now, you might not have a lot of those kind of friends, but they make up for it for how much they show they care. Right now might be hard to make friends, but there are *so* many people out there who are also looking for friends, it just takes time. If you really want to make friends you have to keep trying and not give up, but learn to move on too. Having friends tires me out, so I don't really have any, but that's because I choose to take care of myself instead (insert any other reasons here). Whatever you choose to do is up to you, friends or no friends, just know I'll be there for you either way.\"  \n\n\nFind a way to explain your outlook better, but keep the door to positivity open as well... There is some right to your advice, but can be taken very... very wrong...  \nHopefully you can make it up to your brother and maybe learn from this experience when your niece may need you again. It seems that she really relies on you for emotional support.", "No. Its a fact.", "I think more information is needed and it\u2019s not the kind of information that you can give anyone who wasn\u2019t in the room when you were talking to your niece. \n\nIf the message was, no one is obligated to be your friend and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be kind, but also don\u2019t stress if not everyone likes you- that\u2019s reasonable. If it was more a \u201cwe all die alone\u201d kind of thing than yeah, 9 is too young. \n\nIf the way she repeated it made you sound like a jerk, it\u2019s probably how she understood it, so a follow up conversation is likely warranted (with her brother involved if he is really responsible for her.) \n\nI think anyone who spends any significant time around kids either says something that is misinterpreted or is just not the right thing to say. The proper thing is to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry- I don\u2019t want you to think X,  but I hate to see you sad and wanted you to be able to protect yourself. It seems like maybe I didn\u2019t explain myself very well.\u201d Being part of a kids life means cleaning up your messes, so even if you were a little bit of an AH, I don\u2019t think it was on purpose and the most important thing is to be there for her and make it right if you led her the wrong way.", "NTA.  Sounds like the advice you gave her took the pressure off.  Maybe if she doesn't worry about making friends, she'll actually make a few.", "NTA - You did this kid a favor.  I wish someone would have told ME that when I was younger.  You were honest, sure could have worded it a tad better, but blowing sunshine up someones butt about how friends are what life is ALL ABOUT is crap!  In life friends come and go, some are close, like super close you call them family, but still they come and go.", "NTA. However, you could have phrased it better, like saying people will want to be friends if they want to, and tell your niece not to get too caught up about people who don't want to. Friends will come in time.\nAs for your brother, he took it too far to attack you personally like that. Just because he has friends doesn't mean he is better in any way and can talk to you so disrespectfully like that.\nI suggest you apologise for telling your niece too bluntly about life, but have a talk with your brother about his attitude. Let him know although you made a mistake, it is not an excuse to look down on a person on his lifestyle choices. Cheers.", "NTA.

A 9-year-old can't understand a lot of adult ideas like that.", "NTA.  I wouldn't have gone into betrayal... you're projecting a bit at that point... but she asked for some advice and you gave her yours.", "NTA children need to be taught this and she actually was happier for it. Not the best delivery but parents like to raised entitled brats as they can\u2019t see beyond their own children\u2019s feelings. \n\nYou was real with her and she will probably respect you for that in the future.", "NTA. Friends are nice and make life more fun, but it's not something that can be forced. I think you should have been more careful as talking about betrayal can close her up to prospective friends. Teach her self-love and how to enjoy herself on her own, without avoiding people that are friendly and can afterwards become friends.", "Nta....my sister and I tell my niece the same thing all the time and she is 7. My niece has a very outgoing personality (introvert queen here my sister is outgoing but she balances me out so I'm good)....my niece likes to make sure no one is left out but the problem i have is they don't care if they hurt her feelings and it pisses me off...so we've already taught her one basic life rule: you don't make friends they are acquaintances.....and by the time you reach a decent age in adult life you will be able to count on one hand who your real friends are.  And I told her that you will not need more than 2 friends that will have your back no matter what bs goes on in life....as far as your brother goes ...he sounds like mine...always trying to be friends with everyone but when sht goes down not one single so called friend is there for him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Way to give this little girl trust issues! \n\nThere are a lot of positives about being on one's own, and it is true that you can't automatically expect friends. But the way you talked about it did not effectively cover these things. Plus, you're kind of missing the point of her question. She actively wants to make friends. Telling her she's not entitled to them does not help this, and makes it seem like she'll never have friends. Especially since she was not talking about a specific person not liking her, but not having friends in general. There's a big difference between \"why doesn't \\_\\_ want to be my friend\" and \"why can't I find friends?\" \n\nInstead, you could have explained to her that sometimes it's hard to find people with the same interests as you since everyone is so different, but she should stay open to meeting new people and be patient if she wants to make friends one day. Same message, but more appropriate to what she's actually looking for. 9 is too young to just give up on making friends if that's what she wants.", "YTA yours view is good for you if it suit you well but you have to acknowledged that it is far on the extreme side to be legit advice/talk for a 9 years old.\n\nIf her presence is a littlle bit too much and her question is too serious / hard, deflect to their parent or if the niece won't talk about this with their parent you can.

Interested is interesting, join some extracurriculars with people of the same interests etc. Is there a reason she can identify why it's not happening. Not to victim blame but sometimes we can all do things inadvertently that put people off. \n\nI get that as an 18 year old introvert this may have been hard for you to do but then you could have just NOT had a conversation about something you know little about to an impressionable child. \n\nHowever, the don't make friends they will be betray you nonsense wasn't an acceptable thing to say.

I was not only bullied but abused. Repeatedly, throughout my life, from a shockingly young age, never by family but by a number of different people I trusted. By rights I shouldn't ever trust anyone.\n\nBut by the same token, if I never trusted anyone, I never would have been able to disclose my abuse to someone who was able to help me. I never would have been able to trust the therapists who helped me work through it. And most importantly, I never would have - slowly, reluctantly, and with MUCH hesitation and need for a LOT of reassurance and evidence of their good intentions - learned to trust the people who made my life worth living again, made me feel less alone, made me realise that friendship didn't just have to mean \"people tolerating my presence so they could take advantage of and humiliate me\" but could actually mean \"people genuinely caring about and appreciating me for who I am\". I'm still learning to trust that, but I have a very small group of friends who have PROVEN to me that I can count on them, that I am worthy of being loved . . . and every human deserves that. \n\nWe should NEVER teach children that they can \"only trust themselves\". We should absolutely teach them to \"trust but verify\" . . . or better yet, to be wary before trusting. Teach them the signs of someone who doesn't care about them but is using them; teach them that not everyone has their best interests at heart; teach them to trust their instincts that someone isn't their person.\n\nBut teaching them that NO ONE can be trusted except themselves? That's no way to live.

I've had people get mad at me for ghosting them because I don't have the energy to talk to them every. Single. Day.

You kind of have to tailor your words differently or if you don't know what to tell her at all, even telling her, \"I don't know what to say right now, but I'm sorry, I hope it gets better.\", is an okay truth to let her know too since sometimes talking to kids can be a lot.
