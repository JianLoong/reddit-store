I'm 26, female, and my mother is a textbook narcissist. To her, I was born to give her nonstop validation, attention, and adoration. The earliest age I remember this is age 3. One of her main ways of getting this supply was pretending to be hurt, sick, or scared. If I didn't validate her the right way or enough, she'd sob and sob how I didn't love her, and then I'd have to give her even more validation and attention to \"fix it.\" Another of her main techniques was to pretend to be scared of something and scream, or pretend to slip/fall and scream. Then everyone would have to literally come running and \"make sure she is okay.\" I got to the point where I could tell when my mom was going to let loose a blood curdling shriek from somewhere, it would be a time where someone else was getting attention or the focus wasn't on her. \r  \n\r  \nI was not allowed to have any wants, needs, or feelings. She only permitted the ones that validated her. IF I was the one who was hurt / sick, that was a prime opportunity for her to get supply from others. I remember getting a relatively minor injury as a child, and listening to her sobbing and wailing on the phone all night as she called everyone she knew to wail about how hard it was for her. Many times in my childhood, she'd spend all night sobbing and wailing TO me about things I had zero control over. Then sleep like a baby while I laid awake with fear and anxiety.\r  \n\r  \nSince I wasn't allowed any wants, needs, or feelings, I became extremely self-sufficient as a child. Not only would my mom not help me meet them, she would have a woe-is-me meltdown if she even knew I was trying to meet them. I take care of me and I have done that for my entire life. I date other independent people. I'm also EXTREMELY wary of people who behave like my mom. Yes, most people like validation or comfort time to time, but when it's habitual / common for you, I can't be the person you go to for that. I especially resent when my mom used to put her fear about things I couldn't control onto MY back, relieving her own anxiety while giving me crippling anxiety. Or go LOOKING for things to be upset about .\r  \n\r  \nI was dating my ex, Will and he slowly revealed he was a doomscroller. If someone chooses to doomscroll, it is a choice and I don't want to be the one they contact when they're upset. There are millions of horrible things happening in this world. I can't control them and my brain can't cope with every horrible thing on this planet. So I'm not seeing them out, and if you do seek them out, don't come to me afterwards. I told Will this but he continued to doomscroll and then continued to contact me in the night telling me how upset, anxious and desperate he was over X, Y, and Z horrific thing he found online.

That really sucks that you went through all of that.  I only say this as the last paragraph, which had the crux of the issue, stood on its own.  Your ex sounds like a piece of work.   And so does your mom.  But if you were feeling you needed to put all that back story to provide some sort of excuse as to why you may have been \"mean\" to your ex,  it wasn't necessary.

Don't go looking for trouble because you are sure to find it. It is very juvenile to get upset about each and every thing you read about on the internet. It doesn't do anybody any good. If you are not going to be a force for improving something, don't focus on it or spend any energy on it. So far I'm with you.\n\nWhat would concern me for your future is whether your mum has managed to remove your capacity for empathy from you? If your SO came to you with a real personal problem and needed you to care about that, would you be able to? If you had a child yourself, would you be able to give that child the emotional support that you never received yourself, or have you been hardened so much by your childhood that you would expect everybody else to be as self sufficient as you have been forced to become?

That is why I don't actively look for them. I also try to distance myself from those feelings. For 1 reason, what good does it do to anyone for me to feel sad and anxious about something I can't fix? \n\nWhen I read sad things, I always try to think of something I can do to help. But I also realize I am not God or something to save the world. With that in mind, I also don't go out of my way to make my SO feel miserable. I wouldn't, for instance, call them at night to tell them I was sad about something I read only on purpose to feel sad. I could do something like that happening only if like it was something monstruos, and for some reason, it made me feel very sad. But I don't actively look for it, and even when I am sad, I don't feel the need to bring everyone down with me. What I do, for example, is talk to people to change mindsets or to make someone see something they don't see. But only if they welcome that kind of talk.\n\nI am telling you this because I can be very sensitive. And still wouldn't do what your ex did.\n\nIt could be that your ex needs psychological help, that he is letting those things intrude in his life too much. But you told him you don't like that kind of thing, and he didn't care he just kept calling you to make you feel miserable with him. The thing is, does he really feel miserable? A psychologist once told me that certain people seem to find some kind of sick pleasure on suffering, no I am not talking about BDSM, I am talking of people that can't seem to live without having something to agonize over and they like others to validate their feelings. Some sense of martyrdom.\n\nIf he were really that sensitive, he wouldn't have called you frigid because you didn't want to suffer every night because he enjoys reading sad things.\n\nYou are not sick, or broken, or anything. You just don't enjoy wallowing on sad things. You think that you are less sensitive than \"normal,\" but I dare say you are probably more sensitive than \"normal.\" There are many people who could listen to your bf without letting what he says affect them. There are people who wouldn't need to post here to know they are in their right for not wanting that in their life.\n\nIf you haven't, I would go to therapy because having to grow up with a parent like that has given you the feeling you don't deserve your boundaries and wants. No one needs a reason to break up. You had a valid one, and yet you feel unsure.\n\nAnd a general rule of thump, most cases someone calls someone else frigid, they are in the wrong and they are trying to hurt the other party.\n\nNTA."]}
