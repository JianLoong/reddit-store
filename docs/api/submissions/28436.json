She said she felt moreso confused by just why i got so pissed off when she told me to stop, and she is right, i had no right to be that pissed.\n\nI also apologized for referring to her as the hot cheeto girl, she said that she didnt care that much about me calling her that, and really was just confused for why i thought she was that obnoxious, but even then i still apologized because it was a racial steryotype (she is a black woman just fyi), she said it was fine. She described calling someone a \"hot cheeto girl\" as like calling somoene a \"karen\". She said the reason she did think i was being racist was because she thought it was a microagression, which tbf makes a lot more sense.\n\nI didnt become friends with her or anything, but I did at least try to work things out, and idk if i need to do anything else, i talked to her, we talked abt everything, i apologized for acting like an ass, and she said it was fine.\n\nThank you for all of the feedback :)\n\n ", "created_utc": 1696687917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1727br4/update_aita_for_calling_a_girl_a_bitch/", "score": 65, "replies": ["I\u2019m glad to see you were genuinely open to the feedback.
