(The main symptoms don't include psychiatric symptoms, but they do include confusion.)\n\nMake sure you have a carbon monoxide detector, and if you don't get one and make sure it is checked.\n\nPlease tell us you've booked an appointment with a doctor for tests. \n\nAnd no, NTA for contacting the landlord without discussing it with Mia. For one, if Mia has been more significantly affected by something hazardous within your home, her decision making is questionable. For another, if you'd waited to speak with Mia after doing your online research, that would have added further delay before you could have chance to contact the landlord. \n\nAnd if the landlord doesn't take action, contact whatever inspection services you have in your area who can check the safety of the property.\n\nThe issue is, you have enough awareness of the potential cause to stay out of the property, but if Mia is in denial she won't see a danger from staying put.", "I\u2019m not offering a judgement here but please also get a carbon monoxide alarm as soon as you can. They\u2019re not expensive", "NTA your safety is more important than her beliefs. \n\nYou were responding to your symptoms, not just hers, so you weren\u2019t exactly \u201cquestioning her relationship with God\u201d. If she really is receiving messages from God, protecting yourselves from mold toxicity won\u2019t get in the way of that. And if it turns out it was the mold, well, I\u2019m sure the realization that she cant talk directly to god will be disappointing, but her delusions aren\u2019t your problem. And you certainly shouldn\u2019t be risking lifelong health consequences to protect them.\n\n(Also, I\u2019m no expert, but this sounds more like carbon monoxide poisoning than black mold, so I would get that checked out if you haven\u2019t already)", "NTA\n\nYou were experiencing symptoms and need it checked out before this experience brings you both a LOT closer to God. ykwis?", "NTA you\u2019re checking the safety of you house and your health.", "NTA - you are just taking care of your health.  Clearly, Mia isn't thinking rationally.", "Did you do anything wrong ? No.\nNTA OP\u2026..but yeah you could have been more diplomatic but that is a Life Skill that comes from experience .Which this has been one .\nLive long and Prosper OP.", "Tell your roommate that God wants you both to be healthy and the inspection will go forward and if some cleaning or repairs need to be made, they *will* happen. And she doesn\u2019t have to like it, but she will not interfere or there will be consequences from the school. \n\n I can tell you I would be asking for a different roommate, nonetheless. I thought maybe she was drugging you or something, with you feeling dizzy and weird. NTA", "This sounds very much like carbon monoxide poisoning. You should get a tester right now because that can be fatal.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Black mold drove me crazy for about 4 months. I thought it was bad anxiety, a psychotic episode. We moved and within 2 weeks I was back to myself.", "NTA tell her that her dreams were God warning her that there is something potentially harmful going on and that He came to you and told you, as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've learned that it's easier to go with the crazy and let them think what they want. Either way, you guys need to be safe.", "NTA. One of your reasons for thinking you are the AH is that you didn't talk to Mia but realistically what good would that have done? She would have reacted the same way and might have tried to interfere with the landlord's visit because she didn't want to be proven wrong about the source of her dreams. You didn't call her crazy like she claims and you weren't questioning her religion; you were worried that something that could be affecting both your health in dangerous ways and acted accordingly. She can't expect you to ignore a potential health risk to appease her belief that she is communicating with god.", "Nta.
