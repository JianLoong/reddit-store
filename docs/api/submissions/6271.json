You have to get the granddaughter from point A to point Z, and it is one of the highest priorities of the business in the long term. If it's handled badly, the business will fold and every employee will be out on their rear end.\n\nThere's no iron rules and every situation is different. Treating her too gently is a bad idea. If she shows up in a Porsche, yeah, employees are going to be pissed. But so is not incentivizing the granddaughter to stick with it and learn the business. Keep in mind, she's going to have to put up with her family trying to steal her business from her for the rest of her life. That's something worth compensating.", "No, they can't. I worked at a number of businesses as an IT consultant. And I saw plenty of folks detonate the family business through incompetence. It's practically a meme in business that the idiot child or grandchild CEO gets a coke habit or worse. \n\n The kid is 16. Giving her a couple extra bucks is not a big deal. It incentivizes her to put in the extra work. She needs to learn all parts of the business, and is going to (hopefully) be taking training/education, going to industry events, doing mandatory social events, etc. Those have costs. \n\nIf nothing else, she deserves compensation on the fact that her family sounds like they're going to be pestering her for money.", "Right. And you don't think it's a bit insane to make a 16yo with 9 months part time work experience the heir not just to OPs possessions (which, fine, that's how it works sometimes) but to the position in the company?\n\nThat doesn't sound like being held to higher standards than a stranger. That sounds like skipping every usual interview and training process. In the best case scenario, OP is going to live a long life and train the granddaughter properly before she takes over. In which case she'll probably be qualified, but come into this position without having done anything to deserve it necessarily.\nIn the worst case, it'll leave an incompetent person in charge of the business, to her own detriment and that of any other employees.", "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others, or so I hear", "Who says she's working the same job as someone else? It seems to me that she is being trained to take over the business. So she's kind of like a manager trainee. They make more money than regular employees.", "\"Had the option\" to take the job is deliberately ambiguous. It could mean:\n\n1. The job was always implicitly open (because \"it's family\"), but never expressly offered. \n\n2. The founder told his son that he would offer the grandson a job if the latter wanted one, but never spoke with the grandson directly.\n\n3. The founder directly offered the grandson a job.\n\nThe founder reports further reports \"he said they didn't know the conditions of this job.\" Again, ambiguity: who is \"he\" and \"they\"? The grandson? The son?\n\nRegardless, the fact that the conditions of the job were never clearly set out suggests that option (1) or (2) is really what is at stake here. Who offers someone a job without disclosing the salary and benefits? Any \"offer\" was inchoate and illusory, not specific enough to accept.\n\nMy interpretation of the ambiguity is that the founder never clearly convened the existence of the offer, much less the terms, to the grandson.", "All the son has said is there is favouritism, but he hasn't actually given any evidence of this or answered the questions to him.", "He's less than a year from adulthood. It's not like he's 7. His 16-year-old cousin had no issue approaching grandpa about a job of her own volition. Now 17-year-old feels like he missed out and... asks his dad to deal with it.", "So what? Why should the grandson get the job after showing no interest until finding out about the pay? It\u2019s OP\u2019s decision how to recruit, and of 4 people mentioned, it seems like only one person actually took OP up on it & it worked out for OP and the granddaughter.", "That's useful too. If an employee is pissed that a 16 year old is given a flexible schedule, you don't want them as an employee.", "And the co-workers probably wouldn't know she sets her own hours, unless she frequently walks in and out on a whim. \"It's getting busy in here, bye!!\"", "IDK my aunt is in this situation and definitely feels this way. She is well taken care of and appreciated. Does she get the money family members get, no but they respect and compensate her work ethic very nicely. That's the key.", "It's nice for the little guy to know that the masters are doing well.", "If they are bitter they can quit.", "TY!", "Right. If she was 25 and a full time employee working 15 hours that would be an issue. But she\u2019s a kid learning the ones and being groomed to take over. Flexibility is a must in this situation. I don\u2019t see an issue with that. Fair pay is fair pay though. I\u2019m not sure I know what a bit more is or how available that information is. But it could be an issue.", "I said this multiple times ITA", "For me it is. If my boss's business is unstable, so is my job!", "Lacking a person paid a lot more and given better conditions for the same work might not be a massive hindrance.", "NTA. Your granddaughter took the initiative and asked about working with you. Now she's doing a good job. Meanwhile, your grandson apparently only became interested once he knew how well you're paying her and what her schedule is. The complaint is that she gets paid more for an easier job... as if grandson is entitled to be given the same as a gift. Grandson couldn't even talk to you himself; his dad had to do it. \n\nIt's not about fairness. It's about interest in the company, initiative, and hard work.", "NTA.

Your grandson made a choice. Your granddaughter made a choice. You made a choice. Now your son and grandson are upset. \n\nDecisions have consequences. Your grandson has now learned.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t want the business if it was going to be inconvenient and hard work but since it turns out it\u2019s easier than they thought with a great schedule and pay, now they want a part of it. Sorry, your business so it\u2019s your decision who gets it. Sounds like your granddaughter took the initiative to ask you to teach her the business and she\u2019s reaping the benefits. Smart girl!!", "NTA. They all had the exact same opportunity, but only one took you up on it. Being your business still, you can work out whatever terms between you and your employee - that includes schedule, pay, benefits, etc. The fact that the others are now butt hurt over their percieved slight tells everyone they're only in it for the money and would drive it into the ground after you gave them full ownership. So no, you are doing absolutely right in giving the one person in family who was interested the only position available.", "She's going to take over the business anyway.  It's simply not an option available to the other employees.", "I'm.sufe giving the business to the 16 year old is a brilliant idea", "Hindsight is 20/20! You and your son missed an opportunity that was offered to apparently anyone in the family. I don't see the favoritism, just a couple spoiled little boys. No one is being punished. You snooze, you lose", "Lmao what? Yea man when it comes to a job  most people are in it for the money lol.", "Have to disagree, sorry. Details of what the job entails, the duties, the hours, (and ideally but less commonly) the pay etc should all be in the job advert, if they're not it shows a lack of professionalism from the company. If you don't list at least the duties and the hours, how does anyone know whether or not to apply?\n\nYou don't see job adverts saying \"Microsoft are hiring, please apply.\" They say \"Microsoft are hiring a Marketing Assistant, full time hours, duties include..., pay is...\".", "That\u2019s a really sad assessment, if you don\u2019t decide when your 16 then your screwed.  No where does the grandpa say he specifically talk to anybody about a job, just that they all knew.  I would say that if it\u2019s only a one person business than sooner or later there would have been a problem.  Maybe that\u2019s why the sons moved on.  It\u2019s seems a little weird that gramps is on here saying tough luck to his 17yr old grandson.  Might be the best not to work for him.", "Then maybe you should just say that and not tell part of the story.  Do you even like your grandson?   Did you tell people they could work for you?", "Yes and no, especially when it comes to small businesses. If grandpa is thinking of leaving the business to a family member, better make sure the family member actually likes the business, not just the money since the owner can\u2019t just easily find a new job like when you are the employee.\n\nAdditionally, while the vast majority of people work to live, not live to work, the hope is that you are doing something you enjoy, and aren\u2019t stuck in a soul sucking monotonous drag.", "> That will smack of favoritism and mess everyone else up.\n\nFavoritism is justified sometimes.\n\nLike when a grandchild is the only person who visits an elderly person before they die, elderly person leaves most/all of their estate to grandchild.  Makes a lot of sense, right?  That's favoritism, and it's justified.\n\nHow is it \"fair\" or \"kind\" to granddaughter-who showed interest in OP's company and has helped run it for nearly a year now-to give a portion of the company to someone who specifically only wants to work there for $$ and less work?  Think about what a person like that may do to the business.", "Again  what do you want? Your father to create a position thar doesn't exist to make your son's life easier? To fire his granddaughter and hire your son? I think it's best cause you are both entitled and wouldn't understand that although he is his grandfather at the job he is his boss. Imagine you creating caos everything your son didn't like something your father did.", "If your son is so interested, then maybe he should have approached his grandpa himself rather than having you try to intervene with this \"it isn't fair\" routine.", "That extra equality makes them extra delicious. Bacon, pork chops, ham, sausage, tenderloin....", "I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cthat\u2019s just life\u201d.  That\u2019s an excuse when your reason is not what is said.  why come on here bragging about it.  It\u2019s your family and your bashing grandson for not asking to work there.  I get the feeling grandpa is bitter his sons didn\u2019t want it and now he likes to be the center again.  And why is he bragging about letting his granddaughter pick her hours just because?  I guess that\u2019s life also!  Why even bring up that he pays her more than others that work there?", "You either have unusual teenagers or none.  It is below the average for a 16yr old to have decided a lifetime plan and commit to it.  There is more to this family dispute than is known.", "Hilarious", "Lmao Yea she has more then enough experience to run the company now", "A year away from legal adulthood is not the same as mental adulthood. And still a year away. \n\nHow many people do you know that knew what they wanted to do in the future and made the right choices for it? How many people changed their ideas, plans, dreams, studies. Barely any 17 year old knows what they want from the future. \n\nAnd yeah, teenagers ask their parents to broach difficult conversations with family members. Teenagers don\u2019t take responsibility and start professional conversations, they just ask mom or dad. Especially if grandpa is very strict and hard on mistakes. \nThe kids dad had a terrible way of holding the conversation with grandpa, that was a mistake. The kid definitely could and should have asked grandpa himself. But its no surprise a teenager asked their dad to talk to a family member. \n\nMost of all its just not fair to hold a 17 year old to such responsibilities for their future. Kids make mistakes, we all did.", "Well your son had this opportunity and didn't take it. Now it's too late.", "Working for your grandfather isn\u2019t really a lifetime plan though, is it?

It\u2019s so pocket-watchy to suddenly want to be involved when you see someone else succeeding in something that they had no interest in - and by all means it\u2019s totally ok that nobody else was interested and wanted to pursue other things, but they can\u2019t get salty when it seems to work out for another grandkid.", "You should know", "He's giving her the bussiness they will figure it out", "Tons of 17 year olds are in the middle of picking universities, applying for scholarships or already working, driving cars, able to enlist in the military reserves(country dependent).

I also agree about how to deal with it for the grandson.  He\u2019s being drug through it when it\u2019s the son and grandpas issue.", "Yeah there\u2019s plenty of exploitative business owners", "I'd say NTA. He had a shot and turned it down. Granddaughter took the leap and gets the reward. This is called life, and saying \"its not fair!\" doesnt always mean you get a second chance. It wouldnt be fair to GDaughter to promote GSon up to her level, would it? She wants to do the work because she likes the work. GSon wants the job because it pays more than he thought it would. Who do you want running your business in ten years, someone with a similar passion to yours or someone in it for the money?", "YAH. Passing a business it's not easy. Sons should get an egual part of it. U should sit in a table with all your sons and talk about what is the best for the business and for the family. granddaugheter spent more time or have ideato increase the business income or had the stigmate leader.

I notice people keep saying that the grandson was offered the job and rejected it. As per OP that is not true, and he never rejected the job because he was never offered the job. No one was offered the job, they just knew it was available, apparently. \n\nHonestly I think you and your son are both TA. He should not have gotten mad and asked for a job on his sons behalf, especially since his son was unaware any of this was happening.(I'm aware OP claims the son put his father up to this btw) And I think you're TA because you're clearly still upset that neither of your sons followed in your footsteps and I think that's playing a role in your decision making. After all you wanted your sons to follow in your footsteps, but now you don't want the business spilt between multiple people? So was your original idea to give one son the business and tell the other to kick rocks? It sounds like you wanted them both involved, but now it can only be the granddaughter and there's no room for the grandson? Sure maybe you changed your mind, you're allowed to do so, but don't punish your grandchild just cause you have unresolved issues with his father.", "NTA and the only one favoring one child over the other is your son. Your granddaughter asked for a job and showed interest and dedication, while your grandson didn't want the job in the first place. You offered your granddaughter a perspective.

I\u2019m happy for you that your granddaughter wants to take it over. \n\nYou offered, she\u2019s accepted. That\u2019s it.", "Actually..i think YTA\n\nNot for not giving your grandson a job, but you say that your granddaughter is now getting the business?   So the rest of your children/grandchildren will get nothing?\n\nThat isn\u2019t fair and will certainly fracture the family after you go.\n\nYour granddaughter has shown the right initiative and that should be recognised, but to give her your business while the rest get nothing is wrong.   You need to come up with a fairer way to distribute your income.  Ie maybe she gets the business, the others get more money or a greater share of your home.", "   NTA.

Your granddaughter, who sounds more mature than any of the \"guys\" in the family, is working for you and is doing well, learning the job.\n\n   Stick to your plan. Don't create another job for the 17 yo, don't try to \"make it up\" to him.  That ship has sailed, and he's not part of the crew. *(TBH, I think his dad wants the kid to be supported by Grandpa's business, not have to actually work hard & learn a job.)*", "Sorry, but that sounds odd. He was \"interested in the job\", but he \"decided to try a few more jobs before choosing\"? That's not how things work. Your father had a job offer and your son denied it. What exactly did he expect? That your father waits for how long exactly? 6 months? 1 year? How many other jobs did he want to try out before gracefully accept the job offer? 3? 4? Granddaughter asked and went for the job. Where's the favouring in that?", "Customs around job posting must be a little different between where I live and where you live.\n\nHere a job posting typically will have if it is full time, part time or casual hrs but not the specific schedule on how you are going to get those hrs .. so is it always Mon-Fri 8pm-4pm? Is it night shifts? Is it evenings 3pm-11pm? Do you have to work weekends? Is your schedule the exact same every single week? Work Holidays? Can your schedule change or is it fixed? or in this case can you make up your schedule as long as you are putting in the hrs and getting the work done. Typically if you want to know the exact work scheduled, you have to ask that during the interview; it's not something posted in a job ad. The Son & and Grandson are upset that they didn't know if the Grandson had of taken the job he could of made his own work schedule ... here that's typically a question the candidate have to ask during an interview. I am currently taking University Course, it was my responsibility to ask my current employer during my interview process if they could accommodate my school schedule...not the employers responsibility to post an ad saying they were willing to accommodate students. If I hadn't of asked the question, I would of never of known that they would accommodate me and they would of never of known I needed accommodations.\n\nAs far as pay goes. It isn't uncommon for it not to be listed or if it there is a union at the work site it listed with a range as per union collective agreement. Personally I don't like when employer's don't list wages because I think it's a waste of time.. If it's to low I am not going to take the job .. so why are we wasting my time and their time with an unnecessary job interview .. but unfortunate it's not something uncommon you have to ask during the interview.\n\nSo under duties on the job posting .. you often see specific qualification and main duties they want you to do .. but it's not exactly uncommon for not every duty or details of every duty to be listed. You might also see \"and additional duties as employer see fit\" or something along those lines. Example one of the duties listed might be clean office .. but what cleaning the office entails might not be listed on the job posting, you have to ask during the interview..they don't usually list sweep the office floor, mop office floor, empty office garbage can etc you discuss and ask those things during the interview process.", "Let me get you some paint so you can cross out \"4 legs good, 2  legs bad.\"", "Op already said they are giving the business to the 16 year old who hasn't graduated highschool who has only worked 9 months part time", "The male isn\u2019t much older, only 17, was given the same offer and declined.
