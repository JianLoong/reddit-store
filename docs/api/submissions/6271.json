When you have discord and tension in a workplace, you get less work and more dissatisfaction out of the employees and that can ruin a place. \n\nI'd be cautious with that.", "NTA. \n\nYou owe your grandson absolutely nothing, he had the opportunity to take the job and rejected it. \n\nYour son acting you like you do makes him come off as entitled.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou gave the option and it was rejected by the grandson.  \nNow they are having the buyers remorse, and thinking that the grass is greener on the other side.  \n\n\nI would suggest ignore the son and the grandson", "NTA.  I'm sorry but it is clear your son and grandson are only thinking about money so you may have to talk to them in a language they will understand.  Threaten to disinherit and they will clam up.", "It\u2019s your business do what you want. They are just mad your granddaughter is successful and doing well and want a piece of that. You sound like a responsible business owner and I\u2019m sure the reason you feel confident in her isn\u2019t because of family but because of her aptitude for the job. NTA", "NTA. You aren't giving her anything, she is earning it.", "NTA, your son is an asshole, glad things are going well with your granddaughter!", "The entitlement is high\u2026. Obviously NTA and why are they already fighting about inheritance? So undignified and rude.", "NTA \n\nThey all had the opportunity to learn & work at the business & chose not to for their own reasons. You didn't just give her the job & agree to give her the business to get her to work there. SHE has an interest in the work & she's doing what is needed to take over which is something none of them wanted to do until they heard the money involved. \n\nFact is that you aren't playing favorites nor just giving her everything. She's earning what she's being given which is the right way to do it. It's ironic that the ones whining about it are the ones wanting to have things handed to someone who obviously wasn't interested & wouldn't be good for the business due to that alone. \n\nStick to your guns & cover the business, your granddaughter, & yourself legally so they can't try to do something to take the business from her claiming something like inherentance rights for example. \n\nDon't listen to anyone telling you that you're wrong. You're being a good boss, business owner, & grandpa. They had their chances & it's not yours nor your granddaughter's fault that they didn't take it when offered.", "NTA. Your business, your rules. Stand your ground. Your granddaughter exhibited the incentive first and deserved the job. Be careful with the nepotism though.

Now both want a reward from you after they missed out on it.", "NTA. It's your business, you found someone who is happy to work in it and might at some point take over your business.

Seems weird that your grandson has to go through his parents to talk to you about the job. Feels like there is something being left out of this story. But at the same time, it seems like you chose the person who really wanted the job, not the person chasing an easy job with a big paycheck. NTA", "Was coming here to say this. OP is very much within his rights to not employ his grandson and give his granddaughter the business, but she should not be getting more benefits than present or future employees. It will be counterproductive for her as well, because people will just refuse to help her when she needs it.", "'and since she is my granddaughter I pay her more than I would pay an stranger, also she gets to set her own schedule so basically I'm more flexible with her'\n\nDoesn't really seem responsible to me.", "I didn't offer the job to anyone but everyone knew it was on the table and granddaughter was the only one who took it", "May I ask how he's favoring her? \n\nThere was one job & he knew about it while choosing not to take it until now which you aren't disputing. Saying that he always wanted a daughter, explaining that your son's still trying to find his interest, & claiming he's being punished isn't proof of what you're saying. \n\nWas the job available & known to everyone like OP said or not? (I'm not talking about the pay or benefits. Just the job.) Did he have the opportunity to work there & chose not to until now? Is he actually interested in the business like she is or just the pay/benefits?\n\nIf the answers to the above questions are yes, then I'm sorry to tell you that you're wrong because he had the chance & missed it. Your dad doesn't have to hire him or make a position for him now that he's decided he might be interested & there's no guarantee that he'll stay interested even if he did get a job.", "He can have as much time to decided what job he would like to have for sure. But what he can't have is expecting any job to wait for his decision, it's not a punishment it's how the world works. Your niece not only showed interest but also commitments before your son did. And the job is taken by an employee who've proven herself to the owner of the business. \nIf your son is still interested, nobody is stopping him from looking for jobs in the same industry.\n\nOP is NTA. You're being unreasonable.", "Not but I know that he asked his dad to talk to me about this", "I work for a family business. A persons generosity is going to be greater with family. He has wanted to pass the business for generations which means he has been looking... It's alright to be envious if her but is he's is good at her job you can't ignore that either he said so himself", "My son is more interested than her. She has admitted that she only loves the money. My dad even likes to brag about it and say she is smart for choosing this. He is paying for her hobbies like her guitar classes. He basically told us that we were not smart enough, that we went after the jobs we loved so now we don't earn much money, she went after the high paying job she doesn't like and now she gets enough money to do the things that she likes.", "Well, I mean there is a lot of truth to this - having the foresight to do something you dislike for monetary gain is kinda a big deal in life & will get you far. Also it\u2019s not like these are little kids, they\u2019re at an age that they can make big decisions for themselves (like go to college).\n\nAlso\u2026. Why is not giving your son a job punishment? He\u2019s not entitled to this job, and there isn\u2019t even a job left to be entitled to\u2026 it\u2019s been filled. I honestly think YOU fucked up by not telling your kid to take this opportunity if you\u2019re going to bitch about it on the backend."]}
