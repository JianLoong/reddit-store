Our relationships have been entirely platonic outside of those instances, and there is no reason to disclose that to a new partner. It is unnecessary and pointless.\n\nI have friends with whom I have been in a brief relationship, years and years before. I am not disclosing that either. It isn't relevant.\n\nThings look differently when you are 19 or 20, and everything feels very recent. When you are in your late twenties or early thirties and you had a short-lived sexual relationship with a friend, more than ten years ago, it doesn't matter.", "I am in my 50s and disagree with you.
