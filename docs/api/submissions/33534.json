Your SIL should be doing that but is dropping the ball.", "NAH. You can spend every moment of your life however you want. But if you want to have and maintain meaningful relationships with other humans, you will be required to do unpleasant things from time to time out of consideration for those people. I think your reaction is a little bit outsized, though my opinion is based on very little knowledge and holds no authority whatsoever, obviously. A few things to consider: \n\n- MIL is done hosting, doing multiple events, etc. She's ready to pass the responsibility torch to the next generation. Help her do that however you want.\n- It's just an evening, not a week or even a full day. This isn't the only thing you will be doing \"for Christmas\" this year. It's the length of many other forced social events, like office holiday parties. And the social pressure will be low stakes because her b's family are of little consequence in your life.\n- The additional people (her bf's family) will work in your favor. If it were going to be only the 5 of you, that could get uncomfortable. But the additional people will allow you to avoid her for a large part of the evening. \n- Does the level of discomfort you would experience at this gathering outweigh the level of sadness your husband and his mother would experience being denied the opportunity to share a Christmas celebration together?\n\nYou didn't describe any significant transgressions on her part. It sounds like she's very preoccupied with her weight, but you didn't tell us her \"judgements\" about your weight- which makes me think that it would be easy to take her preoccupation with her weight personally (i say this as a fat autistic person who constantly misinterprets people). For example, if she's constantly making comments about how terrible it is to eat x or how she's gained 5 lbs and that's pathetic, or it would be the end of the world if she went from a size 3 to a size 5, it would be very easy to be insulted by every one of these if you eat x, recently gained 20 lbs, or are a size 12. Do you know what i mean? Her comments could have nothing to do with you, but logically, you could very reasonably be insulted. (*again, my opinion only)\n\nIt sounds like you guys just don't get along and don't really have a relationship, which is fine. That's pretty unremarkable. Many people don't get along and just civilly tolerate each other. Because you didn't mention anything that would warrant actual avoidance for such a small amount of time, I think that you're fine to not like her, but that you'd be unnecessarily unkind to you're husband and MIL to not attend, in this circumstance. \n\n*this comes from an autistic misanthrope who actually had to have things like \"the value of various human relationships, how they work, and how to operate them,\" explained to me in detail; and I still have to work really hard at it. So, maybe view my comment through that filter. \n\nMerry Christmas!", "NTA,", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But don\u2019t expect a mom to choose you over her own children (daughters).  Unless her children were awful people, I feel moms will mostly side with them.", "Yes, you have to change your plans, but your new plans don't have to line up with theirs.  The mom wants to go to her daughter's house for a change, and that's her right.  She doesn't owe you a continuation of what you have been doing.  Make your own plans like an adult and stop whining about it.  And your biggest problem is not your SIL or MIL, it's your spineless husband.  He needs to put on his big boy pants and deal with his mommy like a man instead of a child.  I'm going with a soft YTA because you want everyone else to accommodate what you want instead of you adapting to the change one way or another.", "NTA", "NTA.  Just respond.  \"We are sorry to miss Christmas with you.  Let us know when you have time for us.  We can come to yours.  Or you can come here.  Just let us know.  We would love to see you.

He knows that you can be relied on to tolerate their insults and silently sit in discomfort all day, to make his life easier.\n\nHe doesn't even have to 'confront' them. He can just politely say that going to SIL's house doesn't work for him, and arrange another time to see his parents.\n\nBut it is easier to ruin your Christmas than to act in your defence.", "I agree with you, thanks!", "That's what I was thinking: MIL doesn't want to be in charge of anything anymore if she's getting older which is completely fair. OP, I think the question is how much you and your husband want to see your MIL vs how much you hate SIL. Would you be able to put up with SIL (maybe just gray rock her the whole time) for your MIL's sake?", "I'm an NT extrovert, and I think you did a great job of explaining the nuances of \"the value of various human relationships, how they work, and how to operate them\", as well as the pertinence to OPs situation.\n\nNAH, I think. I grew up in Western U.S.A., so an hour's drive is negligible to me, so my experience may differ from yours. Your situation with an annoying SIL doesn't mean that MIL is not right about wanting to have SIL host instead of MIL. That sentence was complicated, sorry, what I mean is: you are right to be irritated by your SIL, but MIL is also right to want to hand off the hosting to her daughter. Hosting is hard! So much cleaning! \n\nIs your SIL right to talk about her weight loss journey? Probably! She may feel proud about her accomplishments and want to share that with her family! Is she right to talk about YOUR weight? You didn't say that she was criticizing you explicitly, so I'm not sure she did that. Did she call you fat? What happened? Was she just saying that she was skinny and you took that as a criticism of you? \n\nYes, her boyfriend's family will be there. Of course they will! It's a family holiday party, at his house, and they are his family. Maybe you will find a new friend!\n\nUltimately, you are allowed to not go. You are a grown-up person. It is too late in the calendar to try to get your MIL to allow you to host a holiday party at MIL's house (this is too complicated), especially if MIL doesn't want the hassle.", "The memories I have of smiling and wish I could be elsewhere.  All the time wasted with people I didn't particularly like or know.  Spend Christmas doing whatever you enjoy and not putting up with that twit.  Happy holidays.  \ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f\ud83e\udd9c", "Very well put. I completely agree. And it's just an evening, not a week.\n\nAlso, I think the larger number of people that will be in attendance could work in her favor. If it was going to be just the 5 of them, that would be one thing. Though, with so many extra people, she might reasonably be able to avoid SIL for the majority of the evening. It's probably going to be like any other semi-forced social setting, like a work party; but the social pressure would be low-stakes because these people are of no consequence in her life. I'm an autistic misanthrope, and even I could passably shuffle my way through that evening."]}
