I kindly said no thank you and rushed to the back of the bus stop because a food stand was firing up the grill and a thick amount of smoke came our way. The bus comes and the same lady sits behind me. It\u2019s an empty bus as our stop is the start of the route and only one other passenger boards. The lady then taps me again and says I have something in my hair. Then asks if she can take it out but she says it in a not so friendly and stern tone. I told her no, it\u2019s okay I\u2019ll deal with it when I get home. The same woman taps me again and offers a pamphlet. My hands are full as I have my daughter in one hand and a very heavy grocery bag in the other but I decided to just tell her to drop the pamphlet in. I really wanted to tell her no thank you. She asks me to lift my bag. It\u2019s obviously heavy and the woman looks like she is getting a kick out of me lifting the bag. Instead of just dropping the pamphlet in she keeps saying \u201chigher, oh a bit higher\u201d. Then finally puts it in. I thought it was the end but she reaches over to push the pamphlet further in my bag. When I was approaching my stop I got up, put my grocery bag on the chair, took the pamphlet out, &crumbled it so she could see. I tossed it in the public trash. AITA for just wanting to stay to myself. Initially I thought the woman was trying to be kind but constant taps really just started to irk me.
