What does she want your parents to do? Go into financial hardship to keep up with her dad's contribution? If her answer is yes, I think you might have married someone who isn't very nice.\n\nIf she has an expectation of tit for tat in your relationship, you're in for quite a ride. Good luck.", "NTA - my boyfriend and I are in a kind of similar situation. My family is very wealthy and his is not. My parents shower us both (my boyfriend and I have been together for 16 years so they love him like their son) with expensive gifts and money on holidays and often show up with lavish gifts for both of us just to be nice (they LOVE to spoil us and gifts are my mummy's love language) but we never share the actual amounts or draw comparisons when his family purchases gifts for him. For your parents 10 grand is a massive gift when you think of what it means for them. 10 grand is a down payment on a rental property for them to generate income or a downpayment on a nicer car or whatever else. They chose to give you a large amount of money that for them will be difficult to replace. You are not an asshole for taking the amount of money they actually have access to into account.", "NTA but dude. Good luck with that princess.", "NTA.\n\nYou focus a lot on how her parents have a lot, and yours do not.  Honestly, its not important.  Neither set of parents owe either of you anything.  Both gifts are equally valid.  Both gifts are significant and should be cherished.\n\nYou may find your new wife has some growing up to do.  I highly suspect she has some significant entitlement and you may find it difficult to live up to her expectations.  I recommend dealing with this issue as soon as you can.\n\nI would focus on the fact that money is not important.  Family and loving each other is what makes life worth living.  Having parents (on both sides it seems) that love and support you and are expressing it is what is valuable.  If she cannot see that, you may be in for a rough ride.", "So when I got married. my millionaire dad gave me $300. \n\nShe\u2019s entitled and rude.

I don\u2019t think my parents gave me more than 100.00 for my wedding and I never expected more. Our wife sounds spoiled and entitled.", "NTA. \nNot a great way to start a marriage.", "NTA. In our middle class family you get $500 as a wedding gift from your parents. Your fiance has no understanding of reality", "NTA.\nRed flags, buddy.", "NTA   Are you sure you want to marry someone like that, who doesn't recognize that it's the thought and the intent behind a gift that matters? Your parents did what they could and that's an honorable thing. So did hers, It's no one's fault that those two things weren't equal. It's all relative to what each is able to give.", "NTA. Hope you didn't marry a snob, and also that your income is comparable to her dad's within the next 10 years or so.\n\nCould be issues otherwise.", "NTA if she wants the gifts to be equal then she can return the house for a $10k contribution from her parents; everyone wins!", "I agree except surely NTA? She is being pretty gross IMO.", "This cracked me up- but if she's as entitled as she comes off, could also be bribery to take her off her family's hand.", "Of course the person who thinks Melkor was right would say this...", "It feels nice to be noticed \ud83e\udd18", "NTA. Lebanese woman here! I'm so over the old traditions of giving people money as a gift then comparing the amounts on both families. Your family gave what they could when they didn't even have to. It's not some set law. Any money should be appreciated and she should be empathetic and understand how financially difficult it is for many Lebanese people right now. My parents lost everything they had because of it.\n\nYou my friend married a golddigger. Good luck.", "NTA.  A wedding gift should be seen as a surprise windfall, graced not deserved.  There's no call for wife to dismiss your folks' gift as not being enough.  Recommend you have a long talk with her about this.", "NTA if she ever brings this shit up again just tell her \"I'm sorry my family is poor I don't know what you want from them.\" Because it's insane to be expecting more???", "10,000 based on ur lower middle class parents situation seems like more proportionally than the 350,000.", "NTA\n 10 G is a generous gift.  No offense, but your wife is a little bougee.", "NTA. Sorry to be so blunt, but your wife sounds like a spoiled, discontented, misguided little ingrate with zero knowledge of how the world works. I\u2019m afraid you are going to come to realize that you married the wrong woman. Sorry.", "ESH why is it a competition", "This so much!", "And keep the receipt.", "NTA. It sounds like you two may not be aligned on your core values. Those are both very generous gifts and you're both fortunate to come from families who were able to support you both emotionally and financially.", "This a HUGE warning flag.\n\nYou are aware re your parents can not gift the same way your partners parents can. 10k Is pretty sweet for  most people.  \n\nThink about it.", "NTA - it\u2019s a gift. It\u2019s not owed. They don\u2019t have to give you anything and that they gave you as much as they could is very meaningful. \n\nI\u2019m glad you can appreciate that.

Holy shit!", "NTA but now you know what you are married to.", "Wow. Shame you already married her. She should recognize the significance of your parents gift and be happy \nNTA", "NTA 10,000 dollars would mean the world to 99 percent of the population, your wife needs a serious reality check about how much disposable income most people have and the answer is not much. I hope you show your wife these comments and she realizes how entitled, ungrateful and stuck up she sounds. I hope to god your parents never find out she said that because Im sure they would be devastated.", "NTA- if your gf continues to push this bs, that should be easily solved with a little simple math.  Add up your parents assets and income, then her parents assets and income, and figure out what percentage each of the gifts is. Heck, do it purely on income and I'd bet money your parents gift was a bigger sacrifice.", "Who thinks like this?", "I know.  She seems gross and entitled", "INFO why is she angry?\n\nIs she thinking you're saying her dad didn't give her a thoughtful gift? Or that you are looking down on her dad's present as something that was easy for him to give, instead of being grateful?\n\nIs she mad because of the disparity or something?", "If a billionaire gives $1m and a homeless unemployed person gives $5, the latter was more generous. \n\nNTA.", "Why are you married to this person?\n\nYour wife sounds like the sort of person that always wonders why she has no friends.", "I wouldnt accept 10k from my parents.", "Someone who has much can give much and it's barely a blip on their radar \u2013 they didn't need the money, so they don't miss it, and barely notice its loss.

It absolutely makes a difference, and OP is NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is acting terribly.", "Tell her to look at it from a percentage perspective. It might be your parents were the generous ones after all. Also, your wife is the asshole, obviously. That kind of money grubbing is unattractive in everyone\u2019s culture.

They\u2018ve done enough for me.", "NTA 10,000 is a great deal of money and proportionally high against their earnings and assets. I doubt the 350 is proportionally high to her parents money and assets. Which is what I think you meant. Your parents gave a larger percentage of what they had, compared to her parents. So what they have was huge and what her parents gave they could probably just brush off.", "NTA your parents gift was very generous especially given their financial circumstances.  The comparison by your wife was unfair and entitled.  I hope she\u2019s never said anything about it to them.", "NTA. You should calculate what the equivalent gift from her parents in terms of percentage of assets is, and tell her that to be considered equal her parents\u2019 gift needs to add up to that. \n\nJust kidding of course. Both families\u2019 gifts are entirely over the top.", "Both are equally generous.\n\nI'm sure a lot of people would appreciate $1m from a billionaire much more than they would $5 from a homeless unemployed person.", "A shocker."]}
