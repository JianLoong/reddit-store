What does she want your parents to do? Go into financial hardship to keep up with her dad's contribution?

Good luck.", "NTA - my boyfriend and I are in a kind of similar situation. My family is very wealthy and his is not. My parents shower us both (my boyfriend and I have been together for 16 years so they love him like their son) with expensive gifts and money on holidays and often show up with lavish gifts for both of us just to be nice (they LOVE to spoil us and gifts are my mummy's love language) but we never share the actual amounts or draw comparisons when his family purchases gifts for him. For your parents 10 grand is a massive gift when you think of what it means for them. 10 grand is a down payment on a rental property for them to generate income or a downpayment on a nicer car or whatever else. They chose to give you a large amount of money that for them will be difficult to replace. You are not an asshole for taking the amount of money they actually have access to into account.", "NTA but dude. Good luck with that princess.", "NTA.\n\nYou focus a lot on how her parents have a lot, and yours do not.  Honestly, its not important.  Neither set of parents owe either of you anything.  Both gifts are equally valid.  Both gifts are significant and should be cherished.\n\nYou may find your new wife has some growing up to do.  I highly suspect she has some significant entitlement and you may find it difficult to live up to her expectations.  I recommend dealing with this issue as soon as you can.\n\nI would focus on the fact that money is not important.  Family and loving each other is what makes life worth living.  Having parents (on both sides it seems) that love and support you and are expressing it is what is valuable.  If she cannot see that, you may be in for a rough ride.", "So when I got married. my millionaire dad gave me $300. \n\nShe\u2019s entitled and rude.
