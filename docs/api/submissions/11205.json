There are plenty terrible parent-child relationships, but your mother's reaction to your haircut is beyond the pale.  If we're looking at levels of maturity, your mom is on Level 0.

I understand being upset about it, but to that extent is over dramatic and unnecessary", "I am so sorry! NTA of course.  \nMy mother loved my long hair and I finally cut it short (bobbed) the month before I left for university. She cried when she saw it and refused to speak to me for a week - she would pretend to be deaf if I spoke to her. She has never apologised or admitted she was in the wrong and it\u2019s been over thirty years. You were never going to win this battle however you told her - my mother has claimed she was upset that I didn\u2019t give her a heads up first, but that\u2019s just an excuse. It sounds more reasonable to blame you for being secretive or deceitful than to blame you because you cut your own hair.  \nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything you can do other than wait for her to speak to you again - which sounds awful, doesn\u2019t it? I tried talking to my mother at the time - I was so upset and angry. - and it just entrenched her into that position and made her even more stubborn.  \nHave another place to go lined up for the Easter break and if she still isn\u2019t speaking to you, tell your Dad you will go there - don\u2019t be stroppy about it; just say this is making you miserable. Maybe he will have a word if he knows her behaviour is literally keeping you away.  \nAgain, I am so sorry but this is NOT your fault", "ESH. \nYour mother is being psychotic about another person\u2018s hair.

Well, we'll add it just in case I forgot. \n\nSERIOUSLY, who does that? Like yeah, if you want to call and tell someone about your haircut, then cool! Flex it up! But there's no requirement to do so, and it's ridiculous that your mom is so attached to YOUR hair that she needs \"time to process\"... unless there's a religious/spiritual/cultural aspect to it, but even THEN you're 18 and an adult.

I stopped making the decisions about my daughters hair when she expressed her desire to make the decisions when she was 9. If she wanted short, it was short, wanted long, it was long. She wanted rainbow hair when she was 13 so she got rainbow hair. It is her hair, her body, her mind. Just because I gave birth to her body does not mean I own her body because it is exactly that\u2026 her body. Is the same for you, body autonomy is a thing, it is yours. You are also an adult and she was snarky about you doing it when you went to uni but you just took her at her word lol. Your mother is a child so do not feel guilty about not catering to a sulky child.", "For some perspective:  I never even bother telling my husband if I\u2019m getting a change in hairstyle.

I respect his opinion, but ultimately, the decision is mine.\n\nYou\u2019ve chosen to embrace bodily autonomy about 80% of the way, so now go that extra 20% and own it completely.  This means you tell both your parents they don\u2019t get a vote on what you do with your hair, and if they have a problem with that, they need to keep it to themselves or they\u2019ll risk not seeing you at all.
