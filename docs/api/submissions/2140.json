I ended up getting into a pretty heated argument with him.\n\nTo give some family background -- my dad, a divorced American man with four children, had me with my Irish mum. Their relationship turned sour before my birth and my mother ended up going back to Limerick to give birth to me, and she gave me her own last name.\n\nMy dad had to establish his paternity and work out custody from overseas. At one point, he was flying to and from Ireland to see me three days a week for a six-month period. So there has been a lot of bad blood between my parents and my dad has wanted me to take his last name as an adult, which I did not end up doing for a number of reasons. I don't think my brother is lying about me being disinherited, but I also don't believe my father would disinherit me for that reason. I don't believe he was of sound mind when he made this will.\n\nMy father had stage-3b lung cancer for the last five years of his life. He died of some sort of saprophytic infection in a collapsed lung, which was misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. At the end of his life, he was very confused and did not even remember his own children at times. He was living with another one of my brothers at the time -- who was also managing his multifamily rentals --  and I suspect that they may have been unduly influencing him to disinherit me.\n\nMy father disinheriting me means that each of my 4 siblings receive around 800 thousand dollars *more* in liquid cash than they would have received if I was included, and that's not even counting his properties. My dad also owned a couple of acres in a rural valley in Western Norway, right in between the mountains.
