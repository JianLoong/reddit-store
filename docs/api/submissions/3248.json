{"id": 3248, "submission_id": "z4vv30", "title": "AITA for confronting my cousin in front of the whole family for stealing for my house?", "selftext": "Title pretty much sums it up, but if you need more details....\n\nI(Late 30s Male) hosted Thanksgiving at my house. My husband(50s Male) and I have a nephew(16) who stays with us part-time. He has a bedroom on the second floor, and my bedroom is on the third floor. It's a sweet Suite, with a sitting room living room, two walk-in closets and the bedroom. When you walk up the stairs you walk into the sitting room, then there's a small living room, then the bedroom and then you go into either one of the closets from the bedroom. \n\nI have a nephew who is five, and is exhibiting signs of autism. His mother (27 F) is my second cousin. She came, along with her two brothers, and their mother. So everyone's taking turns entertaining my 5 year old nephew because he requires a little bit of extra attention.\n\nAt one point I leave the living room on the first floor, and I see him on the stairs, playing with a toy car and what looks like a watch. I look closer and I see the watch belongs to my husband. And it's a pretty expensive watch to be smashing into a toy car. I asked my nephew where he got it, and he said uncle's (29 Male) backpack. I asked him if he could show me.\n\nHe leads me to the piano room, where everyone put their jackets and whatnot, and my one cousin's backpack. My nephew opens the front portion of the backpack, and I see some other jewelry in there....\n\nI was really pissed off, so I grabbed his backpack, and grab my nephew and went into the living room. I dumped the backpack out onto one of the coffee tables and ask my cousin what the heck was going on with the fact that two of my husband's watches, and a necklace that belong to my mother were in his bag. \n\nI dumped out the bag, and the nephew who lives with me, his Switch was in there. The cousin who's backpack it was freaked out. Saying clearly my autistic nephew put stuff in there that he had taken from upstairs.\n\nI know that's not the case, because he's not tall enough to get to the dresser where the jewelry was. Nor do I think he would even wander that far from everyone else.\n\nAm I the asshole for confronting him in front of everyone?\n\nEdit 1 - cut some things out for the character limit. So when I dumped the bag out, the cousin who stole the stuff, was white as a sheet. His sister asked me later on Earth I would do that in front of everyone?  The man who stole from me, his mother said that what he did was wrong, but I don't need to point it out to everyone, because everyone's going to be looking at him when he comes over their house. That's why I'm wondering if I'm the asshole.\n\nEdit 2 - Added ages. Fixed some typos. \n\nFor those asking, I don't think he's an addict, but in all fairness, I didn't think he was a thief either. I don't think he's a career criminal, because he didn't take the expensive watches, just the midgrade ones. The necklace was just gold plated, so probably only worth 100 or 200 dollars. The point is, there were much more expensive things he could have taken out of the drawers he was in. \n\nI'm second cousin's with the thief's mother. I'm just \"Uncle OP\" to the little guy, because it is a lot easier than, \"second cousin twice removed OP\".", "created_utc": 1669430549, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4vv30/aita_for_confronting_my_cousin_in_front_of_the/", "score": 3731, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
