{"id": 3248, "submission_id": "z4vv30", "title": "AITA for confronting my cousin in front of the whole family for stealing for my house?", "selftext": "Title pretty much sums it up, but if you need more details....\n\nI hosted Thanksgiving at my house. My husband and I have a nephew who stays with us part-time. He has a bedroom on the second floor, and my bedroom is on the third floor. It's a sweet, with a sitting room living room, two walk-in closets and the bedroom. When you walk up the stairs you walk into the sitting room, then there's a small living room, then the bedroom and then you go into either one of the closets from the bedroom. \n\nI have a nephew who is five, and is exhibiting signs of autism. His mother is my second cousin. She came, along with her two brothers, and their mother. So everyone's taking turns entertaining my 5 year old nephew because he requires a little bit of extra attention.\n\nAt one point I leave the living room on the first floor, and I see him on the stairs, playing with a toy car and what looks like a watch. I look closer and I see the watch belongs to my husband. And it's a pretty expensive watch to be smashing into a toy car. I asked my nephew where he got it, and he said uncle's backpack. I asked him if he could show me.\n\nHe leads me to the piano room, where everyone put their jackets and whatnot, and my one cousin's backpack. My nephew opens the front portion of the backpack, and I see some other jewelry in there....\n\nI was really pissed off, so I grabbed his backpack, and grab my nephew and went into the living room. I dumped the backpack out onto one of the coffee tables and ask my cousin what the heck was going on with the fact that two of my husband's watches, and a necklace that belong to my mother were in his bag. \n\nI dumped out the bag, and the nephew who lives with me, his Switch was in there. The cousin who's backpacker was freaked out. Saying clearly my autistic nephew put stuff in there that he had taken from upstairs.\n\nI know that's not the case, because he's not tall enough to get to the dresser where the jewelry was. Nor do I think he would even wander that far from everyone else.\n\nAm I the asshole for confronting him in front of everyone?\n\nEdit 1 - cut some things out for the character limit. So when I dumped the bag out, the cousin who stole the stuff, was white as a sheet. His sister asked me later on Earth I would do that in front of everyone?  The man who stole from me, his mother said that what he did was wrong, but I don't need to point it out to everyone, because everyone's going to be looking at him when he comes over their house. That's why I'm wondering if I'm the asshole.", "created_utc": 1669430549, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4vv30/aita_for_confronting_my_cousin_in_front_of_the/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everybody SHOULD be looking at Cousin Stickyfingers if they invite him over!  You did them all a favor.", "NTA\n\nYou should have called the police.\n\nAnd why *shouldn't* you embarrass him? He's not just a thief, but one who steals from family members.

That's reaching down for another level of low, that's very very low.", "NTA - You did everyone a favor by calling him out in front of them so they know they would be taking a risk by allowing him into their home. His mother and sister are enablers. The Mom's more concerned that her precious baby will be looked at differently now than the fact that he steals from people! Unbelievable.", "NTA\nThose family members who think you are need to stop being in denial, stealing from relatives indicates there is something more going on. That being said you guys really should find out why he\u2019s begun stealing things in case he has much bigger problems than stealing from his family, like gambling/drugs.", "As for OP's edit: \n\n>The man who stole from me, his mother said that what he did was wrong, but I don't need to point it out to everyone, because everyone's going to be looking at him when he comes over their house.\n\n*Good*! That's the point! He's a thief and a liar and everyone *should* be looking at him whenever he goes to their houses since he clearly has no reservations about using the opportunity to snoop around and steal his family members' valuables. His mother is delusional if she can't recognize that the rest of the family watching him like hawks whenever he's at their places is a natural consequence of his own shitty, *literally criminal* behavior.", ">shit-i-tude\n\nMy new favorite word. May I borrow in extreme circumstances?", "I agree, the cousin is obviously the biggest asshole for being a thief, and then blaming an innocent child. But wow, his mother is just as bad for enabling this and trying to put any sort of blame on OP. OP handled it PERFECTLY. And everyone needs to know what a thief he is because I can guarantee you this is not the first or last time he will steal from family members. NO ONE starts off by stealing a bunch of expensive jewelry and a child's switch.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "I don't think he'll be invited over for next thanksgiving.", "YUP. OP, you actually did everyone a favor. Now they're aware that your cousin is a thief and can make appropriate decisions as to whether they want to maintain any sort of relationship with him or not...NTA", "To be honest, I didn't even think about calling the police. I probably should have. \n\nI'm pissed off he took the jewelry, but I'm really pissed off he took my nephew's switch. I literally got my nephew out of an environment where he was being stolen from by his parents, and I just feel like trash because he's in another environment where he almost got stolen from again.", "The room was split 50/50.", "You are right. It is a matter of time when OP's cousin will end up worse for wear if he stole from a victim who fought back and defended their property from him", "Cousin Stickyfingers? I can use that nickname onto someone in extreme circumstances. That Cousin Stickyfingers should be called the Stickyfingers who stole Thanksgiving and OP stole it back and save it", "He shouldn\u2019t be invited over period. Anyone who gives you a hard time about it isn\u2019t welcome either. You\u2019re protecting your family, they can house the thief. It also sounds like the mother and sister knew he does this but kept it to themselves", "OP, you should and need to report him because he won't stop stealing. He will steal from someone else not related to you guys next. He needs to see that his actions are not okay. If he stole from me, I would report and press charges on him quickly", "I didn't even think of that. Now I wonder how long this has been going on?", "He literally brought a backpack so he could steal more stuff.", "My guess? A long time. From the mother\u2019s reaction, they kept it quiet so he would still be included and not \u201clooked at\u201d differently. I say this because they\u2019re not overly upset or concerned that he stole, but that it outed in public.", "I agree. May be OP's cousin has been stealing from his mother and sister's social circles and their neighbours all along"]}
