My husband and I have a nephew who stays with us part-time. He has a bedroom on the second floor, and my bedroom is on the third floor. It's a sweet, with a sitting room living room, two walk-in closets and the bedroom. When you walk up the stairs you walk into the sitting room, then there's a small living room, then the bedroom and then you go into either one of the closets from the bedroom. \n\nI have a nephew who is five, and is exhibiting signs of autism. His mother is my second cousin. She came, along with her two brothers, and their mother. So everyone's taking turns entertaining my 5 year old nephew because he requires a little bit of extra attention.\n\nAt one point I leave the living room on the first floor, and I see him on the stairs, playing with a toy car and what looks like a watch. I look closer and I see the watch belongs to my husband. And it's a pretty expensive watch to be smashing into a toy car. I asked my nephew where he got it, and he said uncle's backpack. I asked him if he could show me.\n\nHe leads me to the piano room, where everyone put their jackets and whatnot, and my one cousin's backpack. My nephew opens the front portion of the backpack, and I see some other jewelry in there....\n\nI was really pissed off, so I grabbed his backpack, and grab my nephew and went into the living room. I dumped the backpack out onto one of the coffee tables and ask my cousin what the heck was going on with the fact that two of my husband's watches, and a necklace that belong to my mother were in his bag. \n\nI dumped out the bag, and the nephew who lives with me, his Switch was in there. The cousin who's backpacker was freaked out. Saying clearly my autistic nephew put stuff in there that he had taken from upstairs.\n\nI know that's not the case, because he's not tall enough to get to the dresser where the jewelry was. Nor do I think he would even wander that far from everyone else.\n\nAm I the asshole for confronting him in front of everyone?\n\nEdit 1 - cut some things out for the character limit. So when I dumped the bag out, the cousin who stole the stuff, was white as a sheet. His sister asked me later on Earth I would do that in front of everyone?  The man who stole from me, his mother said that what he did was wrong, but I don't need to point it out to everyone, because everyone's going to be looking at him when he comes over their house. That's why I'm wondering if I'm the asshole.", "created_utc": 1669430549, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4vv30/aita_for_confronting_my_cousin_in_front_of_the/", "score": 1068, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He stole from you, the rest of the family have to know the truth, because its posible he doit in theirs houses again.

Don\u2019t let him come to your house again.", "NTA. Everyone SHOULD be looking at this klepto every time he comes over.", "NTA. Clearly.    I do commend OP for how she handled the interaction with the child. She didn\u2019t accuse him of wrong doing but asked where he got the watch.", "NTA and of course mommy became defensive. It should be exposed and confronted. I wonder what else they took from other people.", "He\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t call the police.  Everyone in the family needs to know that he\u2019s a thief.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I think you missed the part where you called the police to report this cousin and banned him and his immediate family from ever stepping foot in the house again. What you actually did was far short of what he deserved.", "NTA\nEveryone should be warned and keep their eyes open around him.", "Clearly NTA, but never let him near you again. A thief through and through", "Nta. I would calculate the cost of everything you found in the backpack and respond with the amount to anybody who is trying to guilt you.", "Nta the whole family SHOULD be watching him at their homes from now on. I bet she is just embarrassed that now everyone knows who\u2019s been stealing from them to", "NTA, everyone should be watching him when he visits, he is a theft and can't be trusted.", "NTA. My mothers husband whole family was that way.  Every holiday or gatherings \"things\" would go missing after they all left.  \n\nWhen her husband died, his other family members had actually broke into the house and stole what they wanted, when another \"family\" member took mother grocery shopping.\n\nIt was \"owed\" to them, since he didn't leave them any of the things he promised he would....", "NTA if you don't want people to look at you like you're a thief, don't be a thief", "NTA call the police", "NTA If you don't want people to find out about the bad things you do, don't do bad things.", "NTA. Everyone SHOULD be looking at him when he comes over to their house.", "Is it a suite sweet", "NTA. Make sure any extended family who weren't present for this get-together are aware that he's a sneak thief so they can know what they're getting into should they invite him over. Start a family group chat if need be. Make it very clear to everyone why he and his mother are not welcome in your home or your life before they spread some other story to make the rest of the family not believe you and/or blame you for the event. And if anyone else has had him over recently and realizes that their \u201cmisplaced\u201d goods weren't simply misplaced all the better. \n\nHe should be looked at differently. He stole from your husband and you as well as your nephew that you house. He stole from a CHILD and tried to blame it on another CHILD who has developmental disabilities for fucks sake. He's not a good person and should face whatever consequences that earns him within the family. He's earned being ostracized and so has his mother.", "You caught a liar and thief red handed. Who cares if his mother says now everyone won't treat him the same or trust him again. He stole from family and tried to blame a child for it. Definitely NTA.", "NTA Everyone should be looking at him when he comes to their house.", "NTA. You were protecting your family, including the ones defending your thief of a cousin. \n\nWhat kind of AH has the audacity to rob his own family? Does he have a drug problem? Hopefully he can get some help now that everyone knows their stuff isn't safe around him.", ">everyone's going to be looking at him when he comes over their house\n\nAs they should. You are NTA and you did a favour to your other family members that may be hosting/ having him over in the future, if they were even to invite him.", "NTA. This is the perfect way to handle a thriving family member. Now everyone knows to watch their stuff when he is around.", "NTA. HE STOLE FROM YOU. He is only upset because he got caught. His sister and mother are upset because he got caught and their family got embarrassed. There is the possibility that they know he does it and have been protecting their reputation for who knows how long. You don't mention how shocked they acted. Everyone needs to be watching their things when he comes around. Who knows how long he's been stealing from others. He needed called out publically. You would have been within your rights to call the police on him. $2,000.00 or more is felony theft. That's not local misdemeanor, that's big time. You did him a favor only calling him out in front of the family.", "NTA. And honestly it was best to confront him in front of everyone, so you can avoid him making up lies about what happened when you confronted him and manipulating everyone even further.", ">because everyone's going to be looking at him when he comes over their house.\n\nAs they should. NTA of course. He should be glad you didn't have him arrested", "he is a theft, period.", "NTA - They\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t press charges. Everyone should be warned to watch out for their valuables if he is at their house. \n\nAnyone protecting the thief and not getting them help is the real AH in this situation. \n\nThank goodness the 5 year old nephew exposed the thief before he made it out of the house with possibly thousands of dollars worth of stuff.", "NTA. Everyone should be looking at him. He's a thief!", "NTA. It\u2019s also a suite.", "NTA\n\nGood. This is probably not the first time, and next time they will know who did it.", "NTA. He deliberately climbed 2 flights of stairs to go into rooms and rummaged through your things to take what he considers valuable. \n\nHe didn't just see the switch, watches or necklace just sitting around as an opportunity. He did it with intent. And with his reaction I'm going to assume this is the 1st time he has been caught with evidence and no way to excuse it.\n\n If you did it alone or with his mom they would've tried to dismiss or \"not make it a big deal\". Embarrassment is a great way for ppl to learn and humble themselves or else they will continue to do it cuz they kept getting away with it.", "ESH\nYou have assumed that your cousin stole. You can't know for sure.You are not likely to get the whole truth by acting in the way you did.\n\nIf he did steal, then the family needs to know but not in a public humiliation.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Because, sadly, it's easier to convince reasonable people to drop something than to tackle the one whose moral is already corrupted.", "[removed]", "So - your theory is that the cousin might have been framed? Someone stole it and, for reasons unknown, put the stolen items in the cousins backpack?", "No, putting them on the spot in public is by far the *best* way to get at the truth.\nSee what their first reaction is. Don't give them time to coordinate with their enablers/co-conspirators what their false witness statement is going to be.\n\nThe baseless and provably false accusation against a specific child is a red flag. Innocent people just don't come up with that. Innocent people would much sooner think their own young child was simply trying to steal by putting stuff in their back pack, which would be a far far more likely explanation than that somebody was trying to frame them. And if they thought somebody was trying to frame them, they would think it was somebody cunning with a motive against them, not a handicapped child too young to even know what framing is (but isn't verbal enough to defend themselves against such an accusation very well).", " I wonder how many people think they've just lost their jewelry.
