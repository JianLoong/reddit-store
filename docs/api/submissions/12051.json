She's not getting any better at it. In fact, they even look worse now because she started doing nail art like how a toddler would.\n\nNow, I really couldn't care less whether she paints her nails or not, but I do think that if she decides to do them herself, then she needs to do it right, otherwise they just looks bad and unprofessional. So when she told me yesterday that she thinks she finally mastered her techniques (not even close), I told her what I really think of her nails. She got really upset and said that she can't afford going to the nail salon every two weeks, and if I care so much about how her nails look, then I should be paying for it. I told her that she's a full-grown adult so I shouldn't be paying for her manicures, and that if she can't afford it then she either needs to stop painting her nails or learn how to do it properly. Heck, I'm sure that even I could do a better job than her after watching a few tutorials. We're now on slightly better terms, but she's still kind of mad at me and doesn't want to talk about it.
