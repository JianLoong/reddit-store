Caregiver fatigue is real.", "OP should definitely not be confronting or attacking the husband, but they\u2019ve said Tara can walk unaided over short distances and has a job. It sounds like she wants more independence and mobility. It doesn\u2019t sound like the level of support required for caretaking tasks would supersede Tara\u2019s need to be able take care of herself and do things on her own.\n\nI\u2019m definitely NOT trying to imply that Tara\u2019s husband is in any way abusive, but I was in an abusive marriage when I first became disabled, and I tried to justify the abuse to myself with the \u201ccaretaking is hard\u201d argument. I wish I hadn\u2019t, because my basic needs (food, security, physical safety) went out the window. The relatively basic needs of a disabled person (like being able to go outside, or go to a shop) are very important, and a loving spouse should be willing to negotiate compromises to make this work.\n\nI mean, maybe they\u2019re in the process negotiating of this, we don\u2019t know (which is why OP is\u2014gently\u2014the asshole), but time has passed since the accident and both Tara and her husband already appear to have a great degree of independence. They\u2019re both working and bringing in an income, they\u2019re social with their friends. It does not seem like caretaker support should be a big factor in this anymore. He can still get the social and emotional support of his family from a couple of hours away.", "Tara works too (from home) and she told me they could afford it. She is definitely not in danger and she is not abused, but I'm afraid of her becoming depressed (if she is not already) as she talked about feeling like a prisoner so much.\n\nI'm just worried for my friend and want to support her, but this wasn't the way to go about this...", "Would Tara be able to come visit you for a few weeks after you move and have settled in? That way she can maybe get a better idea if it truly would be easier? Also, it may allow her to interact with individuals who could connect her with better resources in the area.", "NTA. Despite these comments I DO think Tara is being abused. Her husband is trying to keep her against her will in an area that she is dependent on him. I find it hard to sympathize with the \"care giver burnout\" excuse, since he is actively trying to keep her in a place that she requires MORE care, and LESS independence, when she wants to go to a place that is the opposite. He keeps her \"reasons\" why they \"can't\" go, like \"we won't know anyone\", and as soon as that excuse is no longer valid he gives her a different one. He either is SO selfish and prioritizing his wants over her needs, or he wants to keep her dependent on him and \"in her place\" so he doesn't want her to gain any independence. Either way, NTA. Good on you for backing your friend up. I would be worried about what happens to her when the people who advocate for her are leaving tho :/", "Ugh. I\u2019m not here to pass judgement because this is a real life, gritty situation with no finite solution. \n\nFirst off, this sounds like a conversation they\u2019ve had in private on numerous occasions. I think, by pressing him and advocating for your friend, you inserted yourself into a private argument. That\u2019s a really uncomfortable situation to be in. \n\nSomething to consider - based off this conversation, it sounds like she would have a set of friends in the city, not him. I\u2019m sure you consider yourself as friends, but reading the room this presents as the kind of couple-friends that are driven by a primary friendship (eg you and her.) I don\u2019t fault her at all thought for presenting this as a favourable for moving to the city!  \n\nSecondly, I know she\u2019s fortunate enough to be independent ie can WFH, stand on occasion and such. But presumably there is a level of domestic duties that she reasonably cannot be expected to due. Think of all the ordinary household tasks you and your partner split that would be a challenge, such as grocery shopping, cleaning, gardening, household maintenance, putting the rubbish out, cleaning the car, defrosting the freezer. Honestly, with her mobility she can probably do almost all of these tasks but would it be reasonable for her to shoulder the load 50:50 as before her accident? God no! it takes so much longer to complete tasks when your mobility is compromised, not to mention that this is a disability she\u2019s presumably still learning to navigate. No doubt this is where her husband and family contribute more. And I bet this fact is both accepted, but still a prickly reality to both of them. \n\nThird - living in the city is incredibly more expensive than urban living. And honestly, the sense of community (in my experience) is tighter in country locales. having said that, she may want to make friends within the disabled community, in which case urban living makes sense. As for cost of living - do you know their financial breakdown? IE who contributes more, has her potential for earnings diminished since her accident, who manages the household finances? yes, partnerships is never equal but these can be contributing factors. \n\nFourth - is her mobility likely to improve with further rehab and time? I hope this don\u2019t wishful thinking on my behalf, but just throwing this out there in case this is a factor for or against moving to the city either as a temporary or permanent measure.\n\nFifth - will you have a spare room and can she visit you for weekends / long weekends / holidays? \n\nSixth - have we considered this from the perspective of the kids? No doubt this has been a really challenging period for them, with an absent potentially gravely injured Mum in hospital, followed by rehabilitation period at home, and no doubt their relationship with Mum is different, at least in physical terms. Is a move to the city, away from friends, the right thing for them right now? \n\nFinally, city living is not a perfect solution. it certainly has benefits, but it also comes at literal and metaphorical costs. I presume the situation of this couple is very nuanced and, and whilst advocating for your friend (go you!) you\u2019ve accidentally stepped into a private conversation. \n\nMy best recommendation is to discuss the hypothetical move with your friend privately. If you want to support her, equip her with the arguments and logic for a move so she can advocate for herself. Don\u2019t insert yourself into this private discussion unless you think there is a level of abuse or selfish inconsideration, especially as he potentially could leverage her disability to his advantage. \n\nI\u2019m curious - what is your partner\u2019s thoughts on this topic and the conversation itself? \n\nWishing your friend a really positive future as she continues to move on from this event!", "Soft YTA. Of course you want to help Tara, but you can disagree with an action or approach without labelling someone's entire character as cruel. If you take something to extremes, you'll get a strong reaction. Then you lose the opportunity to have a rational conversation that (might) help your friend.", "NTA: This is abuse. She can't leave her house for months out of the year. In the city, she could go anywhere. I bet the city has busses that can take wheel chairs. Might have some accessible buildings. He is keeping her dependent on him intentionally. It's gross.", "NAH imo.  It sounds like husband and family are all wanting her to stay, and while tiring they put in the effort for her so that they can.   She doesn't feel like the effort she's getting is the effort that she actually wants because no one wants to be dependent on someone else.  She needs another voice on her side.  You were asked to butt out, so I wouldn't push it now, just be an ear/shoulder for her, especially once you move.  \n\nThe idea of moving... It was brought up by your friend, and you were not stopped or asked to stop discussing it until you said it was cruel.  Maybe hearing it from someone besides Tara rattled him.  Tara didn't disagree with you.  While you may have no idea what he is going through, he clearly isn't as aware of what she's going through as he should be, and she clearly was glad to have someone on her side of things for a change.", "NTA dont understand how you're to butt out when they're the ones that started the conversation in non-privacy? You're also allowed to advocate and defend your friend. Her quality of life does matter just as much as his. It sounds like they need some kind of compromise and its alarming the feeling like a prisoner part.", "YTA.\n\nHe depends on their family and friends to do what she cannot. She won\u2019t be abled magically on the city. He will have just as much to do for her, with less support.", "YTA\u2014it\u2019s not your fight, your life, or your decision, so you should butt out. I understand you\u2019re worried for your friend feeling isolated, but perhaps there\u2019s something you can actively do to  help her be less isolated? \n\nMoving to the city doesn\u2019t solve all the wintertime logistical frustrations for wheelchair users. Many snowy places don\u2019t clear their sidewalks frequently/well enough for wheelchair users to use safely. Handi-transit is often underfunded  and over capacity, so you\u2019re not always guaranteed a spot on an accessible bus. Regular transit is often hard to access for wheelchair users because it requires you to be able to get to the stop\u2014which may be blocked by ice and snow. There are lots of things that keep people with mobility issues isolated during the winter even in cities.", "YTA. Not your marriage not your problem. \n\nAlso Tara's husband is her caretaker now and the caretaker of their kids most likely.

It's a really walkable European city with cars even being banned from the city center.\n\nI admit, I don't know a lot about mobility aids, but Tara's desire to move to the city seems to make a lot of sense to me.", "Then hey should have it In private not at a dinner with others.", "How about spouses confined to wheelchairs who live in mountain communities?  Do their opinions matter?  As OP says, it\u2019s very difficult to get around in a wheelchair in this mountain community in the summer and impossible in the winter.

Advocating for her friend was right, but calling her friend\u2019s partner cruel is incredibly insulting as, presumably, the two of them have made a lot of sacrifices over the past two years. The only difference is that he had a choice, whereas hers were determined by her disability. I think the topic of moving to the city is a lot more nuanced than what was discussed at the table.", "Something her and her husband could consider (if feasible and desired) is  a trial run and a temporary move. Depending on their jobs, they could spend the summer in the city to see if not having friends and family to provide care could even work. (You don't say how old her kids are - is a large part of the care needs for the kids?) IF the summer went well they could rent somewhere for a year (renting out thier place in the mountains) and reevaluate at the end of the year. They might find they did need more care assistance than they could easily obtain in the city, and it was too much for the family to deal with, or they might fi d it offer up more freedom and I dependence for the whole family. They also might find that she is happy in the city, but he isn't regardless of care needs, which could lead to a whole new set of problems.\n\nThe thing is though its not your business. Its something for them to solve. What would have been appropriate is for you to suggest couples counselling both to deal with the adjustments of the past 2 years and how that has forever altered their relationship as well as navigating opposing desires re moving to the city.", "I\u2019ve commented elsewhere, but I do think it could be easy to misinterpret independence as \u201cadjusted to life like before.\u201d Yes she likely can do most if not all of the domestic duties pre-accident, but would she be as efficient and is it even remotely reasonable to expect her to do so? I\u2019m admittedly reading between the lines here, but this is a big life change and I have to presume he (or family) is likely shouldering more domestic duties.\n\nThe next point I\u2019m going to broach makes me feel uncomfortable just writing. I do not want to imply that she should accept anything other than a loving and supporting partner, but it is a statistical reality that marriages often fail when a female partner becomes disabled, whereas when genders are reversed, women are more ready to support disabled male partners. Ugh, it\u2019s so horrible. I don\u2019t think she should tread lightly around her needs or wants, but I do think it\u2019s important to consider this conversation holistically eg what are the disadvantages and advantages of moving for them as respective individuals and as a couple or family unit, and would it add further strain to their relationship. If a move to the city is counterproductive, could it add, or potentially further, strain to their marriage. Even putting aside gender, acquired disability can challenge the foundations of a relationship. \n\nHonestly, looking objectively at what has been relayed by you, I think you were wildly inappropriate by calling him \u201ccruel\u201d straight off the bat, without trying to better understand their position on this topic. In terms of him knowing people in the city to motivate him to move, I\u2019d suggest he now considers this total to be zero. \n\nBut I also really appreciate you batting for your friend. I just think this needs more of a gentle considered approach than bulldozing your perspective.", "I wouldn\u2019t call it sarcasm.

Be completely reliant on spouse and family that complains about what it costs and how much work it is because where they live she needs constant help, basically held hostage by your disability and limitations of your family.... or abandon your children, divorce your spouse, and leave your family so that you can do things on your own, and not listen to someone complain about having to take care of you... But now you're alone and if something happens you don't have even a little of the support you did.  \n\nOr compromise and find a middle ground where you move somewhere you can be more independent, you won't need as much support, and everyone can have a better quality of life even if there's a period of transition that isn't as great.", "If she leaves the kids might be ruled to stay with him for custody.", "Abusive people do & say plenty to keep their victims in place. \"This is your fault.\" \"You deserve this.\" \"You're a bad person for wanting something else.\" \"I'll get full custody because you're disabled and I'll make sure you don't see the kids again.\" \"I'll k*** myself if you leave me\" \n\nPersonally, I think she should get out. Its harder than \"just leave then\" especially when kids are involved. I hope op can provide a safe place if her friend needs to get out tho.", "I don\u2019t see anything about him being abusive.

I cannot tell you how strongly my family and friends believe in this environment for me. \n\nWould I rather be in a 4th floor walkup from 1928 somewhere in the Hills? Absolutely. But the amount of freedom my location and proper ADA accomodations afford is truly staggering. I feel deeply for Tara as I can imagine how frustrating her day to day must be and how much easier it's possible for her to have it. If her husband was truly her partner in this he'd not only hear what you both have to say, but work on getting Tara somewhere she can flourish. Please give her a high five or finger guns from me. Whichever is preferred. She deserves it. \n\nETA: Everyone concerned for her husband's \"caregiver burnout\" needs to consider that he wouldn't have that if she was able to take care of herself in a more liveable environment.

At home, where everything is adapted to my needs, I \u201cnotice\u201d my disability maybe three times a year (and I lived alone for about three of those five years).

Caretaking is hard because you are one person doing the bulk of the work of just BEING ALIVE for two or more people. If your partner can be alone for extended periods, works, has a social life, has the use of their arms and can stand to transfer themselves, and wants to be able to go out and run errands or see friends unassisted, then that\u2019s just being married to someone with a disability.

The lack of accessibility in public places and adequate medical care are 75% of my problem. Anyone interested in why this is the case should explore the \"social model of disability.\" \n\nTara is living the social model of disability. She cannot live her fullest life because of where she lives and the systemic (and environmental barriers) to living that life. Barriers also include ableist attitudes and assumptions.\n\nI spent 6 months inside a first-floor apartment after major reconstructive surgery to one of my legs. I was in a wheelchair for much of that time. It was a very bad winter where I was living. The snowplow eventually had nowhere else to push snow and it piled up taller than the windows. I spent that winter essentially buried alive in that apartment with the exception of doctor's appointments. I cannot imagine living like that for years on end.\n\nThe husband may well take on more of certain chores and provide some care to Tara. However, he would probably be able to give up some of those responsibilities if Tara were in a place conducive to her free movement. In a city, she could go by herself to appointments, or run errands, or pick up the kids from school, as there are sidewalks, elevators, cabs, and public transportation. In her current environment, even if she gets out of the house, once she gets to another location, she isn't able to enter if there are stairs.\n\nThe husband would benefit from her being more independent. His refusal to move means he is actually choosing to have Tara be more reliant on him than she would otherwise need to be.

At minimum that sounds abusive in a dismissive way but holding her hostage and then blaming her for being a burden is really not great.", "NTA. You\u2019re never the AH for calling out abuse.

If they didn't want other people to be involved, they should talk it through privately. To be honest, I feel like if disability wasn't involved and if you stayed silent, people here would call you a bad friend - because Tara clearly told you that she wants to move and feels bad there. Also, why do I get the feeling that the judgement of many people here would be a bit different and not so strong if you supported the husband...\n\n2) Moving is not easy in no shape and form, but to me, his reasoning is weird and there's probably something else going on, some other reasons why he doesn't want to move. Imo, it's contradictory to say that they can't move because they need help, when in fact, moving would make Tara more independent and needing less help. I think many people here are not understanding of the fact that words like \"disabled\" or \"in a wheelchair\" doesn't necessarily mean 24/7 care and based on your description, it seems like Tara is in a shape where she can take care of herself and other things very week when it's made accessible for her (works from home, also the ability to stand up and walk a few steps makes a big difference in many tasks too). It doesn't seem like her husband would need to be constantly at her reach, especially if they lived in an accessible city, yet people seem to throw around the whole caregiver and caregiver fatigue and burnout stuff a lot, instead of looking at least for a second at her situation. I know it's likely because many able-bodied people are able to have empathy and understanding more for the role of caregiver as it's easier for them to imagine than imagine being disabled, but anyway... people should look at Tara's situation too. I've been both in the disabled and caregiver role (sh*t happens) and honestly, it's disheartening how much more people care about the \"caregiver\" part compared to \"disabled\" part.", "Lightly,  ESH.  We simply do not have all the information and is probably well beyond the limitations of this sub... Or any sub. It sounds like your friend is not fully capable of taking care of herself, or may need an assistant to ensure she isn't putting herself into an unsafe situation.  The husband is probably pretty stressed out and the family is doing more to keep things running than you or your friend realize.\n\nLook I was hit by a truck, my leg was crushed so was my arm and multiple bones in my body.  I was confined to a wheelchair for a while, even told that I would probably never walk unassisted again.   I wanted to make big changes, and did not realize myself how much my family and my girlfriends family were doing beyond what I was focusing on, to keep things smooth and safe for me.  Not just to support me, but also my GF, and those helping me out. Hindsight is a real eye opener in the long run here. I had people who did not have the whole picture trying to urge or help me to change and do this or that.  They sounded intelligent and affirmed what I wanted to do.  And much of what they pitched... honestly wasnt that great of idea, when I look back on things with the knowledge I now have. Not to mention... It would have really only been trying to run from my problems. \n\n I completely understand feeling helplessly trapped and hoping that someplace else will bring freedom. But it could very well be freedom for her and a trap  to him and their kids.  This is something you should let them work out.  Maybe they need to see a professional. Maybe their family needs to see a professional.  Maybe he just needs to lay it flat out what exactly his support system is and why it would be a burden on him to move.  Either way it's between them, not you.", "Right? I'm not saying they shouldn't move, but I can definitely see how the thought of leaving the current support system could feel overwhelming to the husband. Even if Tara could do more if they move, I feel like the fear would be there. \"What if it doesn't help as much as she thinks and now I have to do even more than I do now without the friends and family I have here that help so much?\" I'm sure people will think that's selfish, and to an extent maybe it is, but I think it IS a valid fear. Especially if he's already stretched thin.\n\nTara is romanticizing the idea of so much more freedom and mobility in the city, and maybe she's right, but there will still be things she simply can't do. And I say this as a disabled mother! I mean, maybe the husband is being controlling or cruel, I don't know. But there is a possibility that he is just afraid to leave an entire network of assistance and end up worse off for it. Whether this is a realistic fear or not is hard to say from the little information we (or OP) have. But I get it.", "So you believe that Tara moved to the city, she could be 100% self sufficient to take care of herself, the kids a house etc?\n\nThe bottom line isnt for us to decide how much care Tara needs.

That makes her an AH for getting involved in a couples discussion when she doesn\u2019t understand the full situation.", "How is it abuse? It sounds like he has legitimate reasons for not wanting to move.\n\nYour downplaying of his reasons for not wanting to go doesn't make any sense. Because 1 of his wife's friends will be there, that doesn't seem to even like him or know anything about him (in her own words), negates moving away from all his friends and both their family?", "i agree. & she was backing up her friend. she needs support in this time, especially when her husband is being so isolating", "exactly.

It does sound abusive. She\u2019s trapped- if she left him she almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to take the kids alone. So what choice does she have?", "Imo, when you chose your spouse they go before anyone else in your family (besides children) his responsibility is her and children not whoever else is there. Although I do agree it\u2019s not her place or business to stick her nose into them moving", "If you live with someone disabled, most likely you are their caregiver on some level even if she has some mobility. At the very least I, assume her husband has to do all the food shopping since she can't leave home on her own to do so, so care is being given on that level of him at least doing things outside of the house for her, I assume he drives her places, etc. \n\nOtherwise I agree with you, this is kind of bad signs here.", ">Tara's desire to move to the city seems to make a lot of sense to me.\n\nYeah, it makes a lot of sense *to you*. And you admit you don't really know their day-to-day situation.\n\nI also don't understand why EVERYONE here, including you and the people rightfully voting YTA, assumes that packing your shit and moving to a different city is easy. It's not, especially if you have children. There was a time when, because of my parents' jobs, my family would move frequently. I wish this didn't happen, because it made making friends incredibly difficult and I still have a hard time making friends.\n\nAlso - just because Tara can walk to the bathroom and back, it doesn't mean she can do any household chores. Can she stand up for long enough to wash the dishes? Can she take the kids to and from school? Can she vacuum the house?\n\nAnd also - just because your husband managed to get a job elsewhere, it doesn't mean anyone has similar opportunities. Many jobs are location-specific. Tara works from home. Great. Her husband probably doesn't. Can he find a job elsewhere easily? Because if, for example, he is a ski instructor or something like that, it's very likely that he can't. Is Tara willing to support her entire family if they move? Can she do that?\n\nCan the family afford moving? Because that's not cheap.\n\nAnd do you actually think moving for the sake of Tara would be worth it for their entire family? Would ripping her husband out of his entire support system and their children out of their friend circle be worth it?", "No, we o ly live 1 1/2 hours away and it makes a huge difference between how much help you get. I am the dusabled person which means my kids dad is stuck taking care of things. He gets frustrated which is fair. I was a caretaker twice before so I know where he is coming from but in both cases I lived close to family that could help. We don't. They help when they can but even an hour away means tou are pretty much on your own most of the time.", "I would agree with you if they didn't have kids. But they do. It is not easy to take care of someone, even if this person is somehow independent and take care of kids at the same time.", "Maybe.\n\nBut if husband drops dead of a heart attack 6 months after they move, can Tara be 100% self sufficient taking care of herself, the kids, a house, etc?\n\nThe judgement isn\u2019t on the husband, OP didn\u2019t know that he relied on family help and doesn\u2019t know his motives for not wanting to move.

You act like it is so easy to just pick up and move to the city. Would your friends husband even be able to get a job in the city? Cities tend to be more expensive to live in. Would any job he got in the city pay enough for them to actually afford to live there? H\n\nLet's say they move to the city but he keeps his current job. How long would his commute be? Besides less time with his wife and for doing things around the house it would infinitely increase his burnout rate. You say you get a lot of snow. If he keeps his current job, what happens if the weather turns bad and he gets stuck? I'm sure he could stay with family. But what about Tara? \n\nYou mention accessibility. Tara can only stand for short periods of time and walk a few steps. But it sounds as if she is able to navigate around her current home. How many homes in the city would there be that she could successfully manage to navigate? Homes fitted for disabilities are often a LOT more expensive. Can they afford that?\n\nDo they own where they live? If so, they would probably need to sell it. You live in an old town in the mountains that gets a lot of snow. I highly doubt there are a ton of people just clamoring to move there. So could they even sell it? Don't know where you live. If it's in the US then I can guarantee they have a shitload of medical debt. Moving may just not be financially viable.\n\nBeing a caretaker is exhausting. It's overwhelming. It's neverending. Caretakers need physical and emotional support too. They need breaks and me time. Tara's husband needs his own support system and people he can lean on when it just all feels too much. Which is what his friends and family provide.\n\nMoving to the city will leave him feeling isolated. He will be the only support person for Tara. Sure, you'll be there.

How much time are you actually willing to devote?\n\nYou also mention they have kids. How old? If they're younger and still need a lot of caretaking, then I'm sure being around family is a real help. Still a big help I'm sure even if they're school age. What would uprooting the kids do? Moving them away from all of THEIR friends and THEIR family? \n\nYou're extremely cavalier about your friends family picking up and moving. It's NOT that easy.

Ultimately if she really wants to move to the city she can always leave him and do that.", "NTA. It was harsh but I felt like he needed to hear it and Tara needed a friend to back her up. You're a good friend but I don't see you gaining any brownie points with her husband for a long time.", "NTA Your friend is practically a prisoner in her home when there\u2019s snow on the ground. That\u2019s no way to live and clearly the husband doesn\u2019t care, so someone needs to speak up for her.", "Done please upvote me", "YTA \n\nYou don't have all the facts and it's not actually your business to interfere.  It's quite likely that Tara's husband is heavily dependent on practical and financial support from family and friends - and he would lose support that if they moved to the city.  Tara may feel that she would be able to contribute more and rely less on her husband if they lived in the city but this would be a gamble.\n\nWhat you could do is see if Tara wants to take a trip to a city with you, to give her husband a break and for Tara to see if city life would actually be easier.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nHer husband is right, you should mind your own business. I completely sympathise with Tara wanting more freedom, having mobility issues in a steep, step filled mountain range must be hell. But its between THEM to sort out, because you're only hearing Tara's side of the argument and her husband very well may have good points too.\n\nMaybe he relies on family to support him/the kids given Tara's disability, maybe yes they could afford to move but the husband has a better pay/a better job where he is and he's worried about long term finances. Maybe HIS friends are just as important to him as you are to Tara. \n\nI reckon they probably both have very reasonable arguments on either side and it's a super tough call, I'm not saying the husband is automatically right, but it's for THEM to decide without outside influence.", "NTA", "Nta", "Just to play devil's advocate here. I'm disabled, I have 5 chronic conditions that will eventually lead to me being in a wheelchair and potentially bed bound. Luckily, atm, I can walk short distances with my cane. \nMy mum is constantly telling me and my partner that we should move closer to town. I don't want to and neither does he. If we were to ever move it would probably be into a bigger town than the one we do now and we would look for somewhere closer to the town centre. However, my partner, bless his soul, is happy to be \"the bad guy\" talking about how much money we have poured into our house (not a lie, we have spent a lot) and that it would be wasted if we were to move now.\nIt is entirely possible that this is what is occurring here.\nRegardless, this isn't something for a friend to be commenting on and certainly not at a dinner get together.", "He's very right and YTA - you're implying to him he doesn't care about his wife.", "12 years ago I got cellulitis so bad it almost killed me.  It left me with a lot of health issues and limited mobility that has gradually deteriorated to the point I live 24/7 in a chair.  I can't stand up on my own and can only walk a few steps, even with a walker.  I worked remote for as long as I could (Software Engineer for 30 years) but, after I got sick, I fall asleep during the day and wake hours later not remembering when I fell asleep.  Eventually I couldn't concentrate long enough to work.  I was devastated.  My wife had to become the primary bread winner but is no where near my old earning potential.  I get disability now and she works full time.  We barely make ends meet.  Now that I'm unable to even stand up alone, she has also become responsible for all the housework and caring for me.  I hate that she has to take on all this.  I do what I can.  I used to do most of the cooking, I still do as much meal planing, prep, and online grocery shopping (grocery delivery is a blessing).  I do what ever I can.  I said all this because I understand your friends situation.  NAH, but you need to understand that, while she is still your friend and she wants to do more, her husband has taken on a huge amount of responsibility taking on the lion's share of everything.  He is doing the best he can and needs the help of family and friends.  You visit your friend, talk to her and decide his reluctance to moving is cruel to your friend.  Your intentions are good but wrong.  You need to stay out of their business and not make his job harder.  Support your friend but her care is her hsuband's responsibility, not yours.", "YTA for the way you handled this. I\u2019m sure he felt attacked by what you said at dinner. Also you do not have all the information to make assumptions.", "It sure would be nice to know these answers. \nI would describe my mobility much the same way. \n\nI do 99% of the parenting and inside and outside household chores due to the division of labor that was necessary for us. My husband is a great cook, too, so he enjoys stepping in when he has time or on nights I\u2019m coming home late or when the schedule simply demands or because I need to be in three places at the sams time. \n\nWe do live in a medium sized city and having access to Instacart for groceries has been amazing. I could certainly do the shopping but anything we don\u2019t have to physically do makes a difference and it\u2019s more time to spend on something else. \n\nCooking, cleaning, giving baths and doing kid activities or bill pay or even seeding the lawn from a seated position is not that complicated.. but everyone is different. \n\n(Vehicles also are easily adaptable to be driven using hands and tossing in a WC). \n\nMy experiences are pretty worthless without knowing Tara\u2019s exact needs.. but optimizing what an already capable person can do as a partner in the household should be a priority and I hope they make it happen.", "Being a caregiving is hard but it\u2019s 10x harder to be the actual disabled person. Her husband is keeping her from having her actual accessible needs met. His family being close by is not a need, just a nice thing to have.", "OP walked right into this one and should not have. Tara was quite obviously fishing for support so I'm afraid she doesn't get off scot-free either. ESH.", "There\u2019s no indication she actually requires a caregiver given that she\u2019s clearly often home alone.

NTA\n\nEveryone is ignoring the fact that Tara (you know the one with the disability) is the one that wants to move!!! \n\nTara wants to be able to get out of the house on her own, which is physically impossible in mountain terrains without help. There would also be more resources for Tara and their family in the city so they wouldn't need to rely so heavily on their families. \n\nI do think OP definitely could have handled this better, though. OP, please don't let this argument isolate you from Tara she needs all the emotional support she can get, and she needs to know you have her back and that you hear what she is saying when she talks.", "But Tara clearly thinks they can. She would know. And it\u2019s harder to be Tara than her husband", "It's not just that. OP herself is moving away cause of her husband's great job opportunity but does her friend's husband has the same thing too? And op seems to forget the husband is not just caring for Tara but the kids as well. Who will provide support to the kids?", "The way that OP only thinks about how her friends feel and not consider, kids, finance and support network says more than enough that she's not equipped to handle this conversation, much less insult the primary care taker.\n\n\"Our kids can be their kids friends too\"\n\nTheir kids having friend might not be the priority concern right not. Who is going to wash, feed and finance them? Her whole argument is over simplified.", "Why are you and so many people there assuming Tara has not considered this when she\u2019s been looking into this for an extended period of time?", "To give a person with a disability more agency? Absolutely. Disabled people are still people and don\u2019t have to sacrifice themselves to make everyone else\u2019s lives easier.", "You can definitely vacuum and do the dishes from a wheelchair. YouTube is your friend when learning to do things with a disability. \n\nAnyways.. not OP\u2019s place,  but staying somewhere that is utterly inaccessible would be a miserable nonexistence. If it were me, I would leave. It\u2019s amazing how a city can open up opportunities even just by putting things closer together. Really pretty weird that he wouldn\u2019t want to optimize the capability of the entire household..", "This is a really thoughtful post. Thanks for making it.", "People really hate disabled people to the degree that they feel they should suffer to make everyone else\u2019s lives easier. You are more concerned if the kids have enough friends after they move (they couldn\u2019t make more or anything) than a woman who has very limited freedom. Going on about her husband\u2019s potential depression, how depressed do you think she is now? FFS.", "Y\u2019all really think Tara would be suggesting that if she knew?? Or the husband wouldn\u2019t bring this up?? Why is everyone acting like Tara is a child that wants a toy??", "As a disabled person who moved from the mountains to the city yes it will allow more independence I assure you.", "Needing someone around doesn\u2019t make them a caregiver?

Disabled people always know more than our caregivers (and I\u2019ve been both before you try if)", "Her individual care needs aren\u2019t the issue. The household management and childcare are most important here.\n\nThat said, no, disabled people don\u2019t \u201calways\u201d know more than caregivers. That\u2019s a ridiculous statement.", "\"This crap about him being a caregiver, being unable to find a job, or needing to make plans is all a distraction\" \n\nThis is a really bizarre take. For a regular move any non-millionaire would need to undertake significant financial planning, job research and research about the area and facilities. When someone has additional needs, there's a lot more planning to make sure a house, local area and public transport is equipped to accomodate their needs.\n\nTara doesn't need to say; she may elect to leave her partner if he wants to stay in that town. But arguing planning and important aren't important is a strange take.", "I grew up in a mountain area and left because I\u2019m disabled.
