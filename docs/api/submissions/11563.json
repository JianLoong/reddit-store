She is able to stand for short amount of times and take a few steps, so she is pretty self-sufficient, but she needs her wheelchair. Especially, when she wants to leave the house.\n\nThe problem is that we live in an old town in the mountains that wasn't build with disabled people in mind. It's hard for Tara to get around during the summer and it's nearly impossible during the winter, since we get a lot of snow here. Tara tells me a lot how she wants to move out of the mountains, to the city, but her husband doesn't want them to, because all their family and friends are here.\n\nMy husband got a great job opportunity in the city, so we are moving there. We were having a dinner with Tara and her husband and we were talking about us moving. Tara seemed happy, she said that if they move there too, it will be so good that we will already be there and their kids would have friends there too (our kids). She told her husband that now they don't have to worry about being alone and not knowing anyone there.\n\nHer husband shut her down saying that they already talked about this and they need the help their families are providing them here and they can't move away. Tara said they wouldn't need so much help if she could move around more freely in the city. I took Tara's side and the conversation went on, until I started getting frustrated and told Tara's husband that he is cruel for forcing his wife to live in the mountains where her mobility is so limited.\n\nHe got angry, told me I have no idea how hard it is for him even with all the help and I should mind my own business.\n\nHe is right that I don't know how it is for him.

It doesn't cost a lot to charge the battery either, so for an initial outlay it's very economical.  \n\nGetting around a city is harder than getting around our closest town due to the volume of people and traffic.

Yes, caregivers can have burnout, but she would like to be an individual who can be independent. She's lost enough.  Her quality of life should also be important, especially with kids she wants to continue raising like before.", "> Caregivers need a support system too. \n\nSo. True. Caregiver fatigue is real.", "OP should definitely not be confronting or attacking the husband, but they\u2019ve said Tara can walk unaided over short distances and has a job. It sounds like she wants more independence and mobility. It doesn\u2019t sound like the level of support required for caretaking tasks would supersede Tara\u2019s need to be able take care of herself and do things on her own.\n\nI\u2019m definitely NOT trying to imply that Tara\u2019s husband is in any way abusive, but I was in an abusive marriage when I first became disabled, and I tried to justify the abuse to myself with the \u201ccaretaking is hard\u201d argument. I wish I hadn\u2019t, because my basic needs (food, security, physical safety) went out the window. The relatively basic needs of a disabled person (like being able to go outside, or go to a shop) are very important, and a loving spouse should be willing to negotiate compromises to make this work.\n\nI mean, maybe they\u2019re in the process negotiating of this, we don\u2019t know (which is why OP is\u2014gently\u2014the asshole), but time has passed since the accident and both Tara and her husband already appear to have a great degree of independence. They\u2019re both working and bringing in an income, they\u2019re social with their friends. It does not seem like caretaker support should be a big factor in this anymore. He can still get the social and emotional support of his family from a couple of hours away.", "Tara works too (from home) and she told me they could afford it. She is definitely not in danger and she is not abused, but I'm afraid of her becoming depressed (if she is not already) as she talked about feeling like a prisoner so much.\n\nI'm just worried for my friend and want to support her, but this wasn't the way to go about this..."]}
