Yes, caregivers can have burnout, but she would like to be an individual who can be independent. She's lost enough.  Her quality of life should also be important, especially with kids she wants to continue raising like before.", "> Caregivers need a support system too. \n\nSo. True. Caregiver fatigue is real.", "OP should definitely not be confronting or attacking the husband, but they\u2019ve said Tara can walk unaided over short distances and has a job. It sounds like she wants more independence and mobility. It doesn\u2019t sound like the level of support required for caretaking tasks would supersede Tara\u2019s need to be able take care of herself and do things on her own.\n\nI\u2019m definitely NOT trying to imply that Tara\u2019s husband is in any way abusive, but I was in an abusive marriage when I first became disabled, and I tried to justify the abuse to myself with the \u201ccaretaking is hard\u201d argument. I wish I hadn\u2019t, because my basic needs (food, security, physical safety) went out the window. The relatively basic needs of a disabled person (like being able to go outside, or go to a shop) are very important, and a loving spouse should be willing to negotiate compromises to make this work.\n\nI mean, maybe they\u2019re in the process negotiating of this, we don\u2019t know (which is why OP is\u2014gently\u2014the asshole), but time has passed since the accident and both Tara and her husband already appear to have a great degree of independence. They\u2019re both working and bringing in an income, they\u2019re social with their friends. It does not seem like caretaker support should be a big factor in this anymore. He can still get the social and emotional support of his family from a couple of hours away.", "Tara works too (from home) and she told me they could afford it. She is definitely not in danger and she is not abused, but I'm afraid of her becoming depressed (if she is not already) as she talked about feeling like a prisoner so much.\n\nI'm just worried for my friend and want to support her, but this wasn't the way to go about this...", "Would Tara be able to come visit you for a few weeks after you move and have settled in? That way she can maybe get a better idea if it truly would be easier? Also, it may allow her to interact with individuals who could connect her with better resources in the area.", "NTA. Despite these comments I DO think Tara is being abused. Her husband is trying to keep her against her will in an area that she is dependent on him. I find it hard to sympathize with the \"care giver burnout\" excuse, since he is actively trying to keep her in a place that she requires MORE care, and LESS independence, when she wants to go to a place that is the opposite. He keeps her \"reasons\" why they \"can't\" go, like \"we won't know anyone\", and as soon as that excuse is no longer valid he gives her a different one. He either is SO selfish and prioritizing his wants over her needs, or he wants to keep her dependent on him and \"in her place\" so he doesn't want her to gain any independence. Either way, NTA. Good on you for backing your friend up. I would be worried about what happens to her when the people who advocate for her are leaving tho :/", "Ugh. I\u2019m not here to pass judgement because this is a real life, gritty situation with no finite solution. \n\nFirst off, this sounds like a conversation they\u2019ve had in private on numerous occasions. I think, by pressing him and advocating for your friend, you inserted yourself into a private argument. That\u2019s a really uncomfortable situation to be in. \n\nSomething to consider - based off this conversation, it sounds like she would have a set of friends in the city, not him. I\u2019m sure you consider yourself as friends, but reading the room this presents as the kind of couple-friends that are driven by a primary friendship (eg you and her.) I don\u2019t fault her at all thought for presenting this as a favourable for moving to the city!  \n\nSecondly, I know she\u2019s fortunate enough to be independent ie can WFH, stand on occasion and such. But presumably there is a level of domestic duties that she reasonably cannot be expected to due. Think of all the ordinary household tasks you and your partner split that would be a challenge, such as grocery shopping, cleaning, gardening, household maintenance, putting the rubbish out, cleaning the car, defrosting the freezer. Honestly, with her mobility she can probably do almost all of these tasks but would it be reasonable for her to shoulder the load 50:50 as before her accident? God no! it takes so much longer to complete tasks when your mobility is compromised, not to mention that this is a disability she\u2019s presumably still learning to navigate. No doubt this is where her husband and family contribute more. And I bet this fact is both accepted, but still a prickly reality to both of them. \n\nThird - living in the city is incredibly more expensive than urban living. And honestly, the sense of community (in my experience) is tighter in country locales. having said that, she may want to make friends within the disabled community, in which case urban living makes sense. As for cost of living - do you know their financial breakdown? IE who contributes more, has her potential for earnings diminished since her accident, who manages the household finances? yes, partnerships is never equal but these can be contributing factors. \n\nFourth - is her mobility likely to improve with further rehab and time? I hope this don\u2019t wishful thinking on my behalf, but just throwing this out there in case this is a factor for or against moving to the city either as a temporary or permanent measure.\n\nFifth - will you have a spare room and can she visit you for weekends / long weekends / holidays? \n\nSixth - have we considered this from the perspective of the kids? No doubt this has been a really challenging period for them, with an absent potentially gravely injured Mum in hospital, followed by rehabilitation period at home, and no doubt their relationship with Mum is different, at least in physical terms. Is a move to the city, away from friends, the right thing for them right now? \n\nFinally, city living is not a perfect solution. it certainly has benefits, but it also comes at literal and metaphorical costs. I presume the situation of this couple is very nuanced and, and whilst advocating for your friend (go you!) you\u2019ve accidentally stepped into a private conversation. \n\nMy best recommendation is to discuss the hypothetical move with your friend privately. If you want to support her, equip her with the arguments and logic for a move so she can advocate for herself. Don\u2019t insert yourself into this private discussion unless you think there is a level of abuse or selfish inconsideration, especially as he potentially could leverage her disability to his advantage. \n\nI\u2019m curious - what is your partner\u2019s thoughts on this topic and the conversation itself? \n\nWishing your friend a really positive future as she continues to move on from this event!", "Soft YTA. Of course you want to help Tara, but you can disagree with an action or approach without labelling someone's entire character as cruel. If you take something to extremes, you'll get a strong reaction. Then you lose the opportunity to have a rational conversation that (might) help your friend.", "NTA: This is abuse. She can't leave her house for months out of the year. In the city, she could go anywhere. I bet the city has busses that can take wheel chairs. Might have some accessible buildings. He is keeping her dependent on him intentionally. It's gross.", "NAH imo.  It sounds like husband and family are all wanting her to stay, and while tiring they put in the effort for her so that they can.   She doesn't feel like the effort she's getting is the effort that she actually wants because no one wants to be dependent on someone else.  She needs another voice on her side.  You were asked to butt out, so I wouldn't push it now, just be an ear/shoulder for her, especially once you move.  \n\nThe idea of moving... It was brought up by your friend, and you were not stopped or asked to stop discussing it until you said it was cruel.  Maybe hearing it from someone besides Tara rattled him.  Tara didn't disagree with you.  While you may have no idea what he is going through, he clearly isn't as aware of what she's going through as he should be, and she clearly was glad to have someone on her side of things for a change.", "NTA dont understand how you're to butt out when they're the ones that started the conversation in non-privacy? You're also allowed to advocate and defend your friend. Her quality of life does matter just as much as his. It sounds like they need some kind of compromise and its alarming the feeling like a prisoner part.", "YTA.\n\nHe depends on their family and friends to do what she cannot. She won\u2019t be abled magically on the city. He will have just as much to do for her, with less support.", "YTA\u2014it\u2019s not your fight, your life, or your decision, so you should butt out. I understand you\u2019re worried for your friend feeling isolated, but perhaps there\u2019s something you can actively do to  help her be less isolated? \n\nMoving to the city doesn\u2019t solve all the wintertime logistical frustrations for wheelchair users. Many snowy places don\u2019t clear their sidewalks frequently/well enough for wheelchair users to use safely. Handi-transit is often underfunded  and over capacity, so you\u2019re not always guaranteed a spot on an accessible bus. Regular transit is often hard to access for wheelchair users because it requires you to be able to get to the stop\u2014which may be blocked by ice and snow. There are lots of things that keep people with mobility issues isolated during the winter even in cities.", "YTA. Not your marriage not your problem. \n\nAlso Tara's husband is her caretaker now and the caretaker of their kids most likely.

It's a really walkable European city with cars even being banned from the city center.\n\nI admit, I don't know a lot about mobility aids, but Tara's desire to move to the city seems to make a lot of sense to me.", "Then hey should have it In private not at a dinner with others.", "How about spouses confined to wheelchairs who live in mountain communities?  Do their opinions matter?  As OP says, it\u2019s very difficult to get around in a wheelchair in this mountain community in the summer and impossible in the winter.

Advocating for her friend was right, but calling her friend\u2019s partner cruel is incredibly insulting as, presumably, the two of them have made a lot of sacrifices over the past two years. The only difference is that he had a choice, whereas hers were determined by her disability. I think the topic of moving to the city is a lot more nuanced than what was discussed at the table.", "Something her and her husband could consider (if feasible and desired) is  a trial run and a temporary move. Depending on their jobs, they could spend the summer in the city to see if not having friends and family to provide care could even work. (You don't say how old her kids are - is a large part of the care needs for the kids?) IF the summer went well they could rent somewhere for a year (renting out thier place in the mountains) and reevaluate at the end of the year. They might find they did need more care assistance than they could easily obtain in the city, and it was too much for the family to deal with, or they might fi d it offer up more freedom and I dependence for the whole family. They also might find that she is happy in the city, but he isn't regardless of care needs, which could lead to a whole new set of problems.\n\nThe thing is though its not your business. Its something for them to solve. What would have been appropriate is for you to suggest couples counselling both to deal with the adjustments of the past 2 years and how that has forever altered their relationship as well as navigating opposing desires re moving to the city.", "I\u2019ve commented elsewhere, but I do think its could be eas to misinterpret independence as \u201cadjusted to life like before.\u201d Yes she likely can do most if not all of the domestic duties pre-accident, but would she be as efficient and is it even remotely reasonable to expect her to do so? I\u2019m admittedly reading between the lines here, but this is a big life change and I have to presume he (or family) is likely shouldering more domestic duties. \n\nThe next point I\u2019m going to broach makes me feel uncomfortable just writing. I do not want to imply that she should accept anything other than a loving and supporting partner, but it is a statistical reality that marriages often fail when a female partner becomes disabled, whereas when genders are reversed, women are more ready to support disabled male partners. Ugh, it\u2019s so horrible. I don\u2019t think she should tread lightly around her needs or wants, but I do think it\u2019s important to consider this conversation holistically eg what are the disadvantages and advantages of move for them as respective individuals and couples, and would it add further strain to their relationship. If a move to the city is counterproductive, could it add, or potentially further, strain to their marriage. Even putting aside gender, acquired disability can challenge the foundations of a relationship. \n\nHonestly, looking objectively at what has been relayed by you, I think you were wildly inappropriate by calling him \u201ccruel\u201d straight off the bat, without trying to better understand their position on this topic. In terms of him knowing people in the city to motivate him to move, I\u2019d suggest he now considers this total to be zero. \n\nBut I also really appreciate you batting for your friend. I just think this needs more of a gentle considered approach than bulldozing your perspective.", "Egh, i wouldn\u2019t call it sarcasm. just a clumsy way of saying they empathise with Tara the most.

But now you're alone and if something happens you don't have even a little of the support you did.  \n\nOr compromise and find a middle ground where you move somewhere you can be more independent, you won't need as much support, and everyone can have a better quality of life even if there's a period of transition that isn't as great.", "If she leaves the kids might be ruled to stay with him for custody.", "Abusive people do & say plenty to keep their victims in place. \"This is your fault.\" \"You deserve this.\" \"You're a bad person for wanting something else.\" \"I'll get full custody because you're disabled and I'll make sure you don't see the kids again.\" \"I'll k*** myself if you leave me\" \n\nPersonally, I think she should get out. Its harder than \"just leave then\" especially when kids are involved. I hope op can provide a safe place if her friend needs to get out tho.", "I don\u2019t see anything about him being abusive.
