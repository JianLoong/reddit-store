Was there something that triggered that behaviour? It sounds like she might benefit from therapy.", "It sounds like your wife has a hoarding problem. It can bubble out of control if the two of you don't find a way to deal with it (see \"extreme horders\" on youtube or A&E)\n\nYou're NTA. Its your fridge too, and spoiled perishables can contaminate other food and make you sick and even if she's the only one who gets sick, it's still kinda your problem.\n\nFind a mental health expert in your area who can help you to get a handle on the situation.", "I don\u2019t even know if this is an asshole post this ice cream in the freezer for seven years is a huge problem. This is Hoarding. Did your wife grow up in a home where they were poor and didn\u2019t have a lot of food? Was there trauma? Eating disorder? Some people hoard different things for many reasons. I would have a real live conversation about what is going on and if it is something that can\u2019t be worked out get her a cheap ass refrigerator off craigslist or Facebook marketplace even if it\u2019s a mini fridge and let her use that for things that she wants to put up . I don\u2019t really agree with encouraging this behavior, but if you want the middle ground, maybe that could be it. Her rotting food is going to affect the entire refrigerator.  It\u2019s unhealthy and frankly you shouldn\u2019t be eating old food either.", "ESH. She's being ridiculous and wasting valuable freezer space, but you are only reinforcing her insecurities by eating her special food.  She's worried she will be sad when it is gone and then you eat it and it's gone and she's sad.  How are you helping?\n\nThe solution is to eat and immediately replace. This may involve buying the replacement before you finish off the original.  If she realizes all of this food is not as special as she's making it out to be, she may soften her stance on turning your refrigerator into a time capsule.", "Let me clarify one thing: We have her/my food when we want different flavors. She'll get a pint in a flavor she likes, I'll get one in a flavor I like.\n\nIt's not like all our food is separate.", "This isn\u2019t about food, it\u2019s about control and boundaries.  I lived a similar thing for many years with my husband.\n\nFood was (and is) the most important thing in his life.  When we were first married, he ate practically everything I cooked, no matter how much I made.  I would put aside leftovers for work, and if i forgot it, he ate when he got home.  We fought about it A LOT and I couldn\u2019t make him see that he considered \u2018his\u2019 food his, and my food up for grabs.\n\n(Normal people share and have consideration, he was an only child who got everything and doesn\u2019t know what sharing MEANS.)\n\nFinally he started to ask, but in a way meant to guilt me into giving it to him - \u2018Are you going to eat that?\u2019 \u2019Yes\u2019.  \u2018When?  It\u2019s been there for 2 days.\u2018. \u2018I\u2019ll eat it when I want!\u2019  \u2018But it\u2019s going to go bad, are you sure you\u2019re going to eat it?\u2019.\n\nSeriously, it nearly ended our marriage.  I finally told him that my food was MINE and he wasn\u2019t to ask for it, or touch it and if he did, I was done.  If there was something I didn\u2019t want I would offer it, but otherwise SHUT THE F UP about it.  If something goes bad and gets tossed, LIVE WITH IT!\n\nSo OP, you may not like how your wife eats things, but that\u2019s NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.  If she buys herself something, ITS HERS.  You have no right to question how she eats, what she eats, or to take HER property.  Taking food you think she forgot is no different than taking electronics you think she doesn\u2019t use, or money that left sitting in her drawer.\n\nBottom line - ITS NOT YOURS!  Stop thinking \u2018you know better\u2019, and what YOU want is more important that what SHE wants.\n\nTheres a blog post \u2018She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes by the Sink\u2019 (I\u2019d link it, but don\u2019t know how) - google it and read it.  Because YOURS is going to be \u2018She divorced me because I threw out her old ice cream\u2019.

Are you going to finish eating them?  My I have them if she says no to finish eating them  Or   May I have some", "NTA! She is your wife not your roommate, the food in the house should be shared. And I think she may have some scarcity issues that she should address with the help of a professional. I wouldn\u2019t be s bad idea to also treat her sharing issues.", "I\u2019m going to say NAH/ESH. I\u2019m a lot like your wife (I mean, I\u2019m not seven years bad, but still). What my partner and I do to combat this is that I have a set amount of time where my food is only mine (this varies, obviously a pint of ice cream is going to last longer than like fresh strawberries in the fridge or scones or whatever), and then after that time my partner can ask me if he can eat it. Or I will tell him, hey if I don\u2019t eat this by Wednesday you can have it. That kind of thing. I think if you can work out a system like this with your wife, things will go a lot smoother in your household.", "What?  Nta.  What a waste.  Nothing stays in a freezer 7 years!  \n\nSounds like something else going on for her emotionally and the food hoarding is the outlet.  Eg never had enough when she was young.. youngest of lots of siblings.. something like that maybe?", "ESH, I get you don't want to waste food and that's commendable but you and your wife have been ignoring her obvious mental health issues.\n\nAlso you both might have serious issues from eating rotten food.", "NTA, but I feel like the simplest solution here is to finish something and then replace it.   Then she has a re-stock of the thing she likes sans freezer-burn, and you get to eat her stuff and save it from going bad.  \"Hey honey, I noticed your icecream was getting pretty stale so I bought you a new pint!  Aren't I just the best!\"", "NAH, but you should probably talk to her about it.", "NAH, your life partners. You should be able to share food.", "I think you should eat the food before it goes bad because why waste it.  Although as a good partner you could replace the items with new/fresh stuff.  You know ..... like sharing", "Your wife is using food for something in her life.  Maybe as a child she was denied nice food treats, but whatever it is, sit and talk about it.  If need be, have her go to counseling.  That is wasteful and with food prices today, no one can afford to waste food.", "NTA - I think you should allow her food to sit until it reaches the expiry date. At that date, it should be good to go. \n\nNo idea why she's so possessive of food that's inedible and will probably kill her. Maybe she grew up with food poverty.", "I eat everything, my wife shares a lot so she doesn\u2019t get fat. She also know I have food security issues around not wasting anything.

I have OCD that mainly revolves around food and drinks. I am scared of food be contaminated or the possibility of it making me sick so I\u2019ll often enjoy things for a couple days, a week and then I can\u2019t eat it anymore but I also feel bad throwing it away. Me and my partner have a system, he won\u2019t touch my special snacks I but for a bit so I have enough to eat when I do (he tends to eat more than I do so he could finish off a bag of chips in a day that I would munch on for five days) however, he knows my limits, he knows when I won\u2019t eat it anymore and swoops in and will clean it off. Basically it\u2019s a system where after a certain period of time food becomes fair game so maybe y\u2019all could communicate a fair game point in food so she doesn\u2019t feel like she can\u2019t eat something she wanted but food won\u2019t go to waste either.", "There's your/my food because she buys a pint in a flavor she likes, and I buy a pint in the flavor I like.", "Almost sounds like hoarding honestly, she is attaching some sort of important meaning to something that has none, it can be replaced.

Replacing everything over and over again just so that it isn't gone does absolutely nothing but reinforce the hoarding, the food waste and the waste of money.", "I agree", "Perhaps it should be - get a second fridge for yourself, apologize for touching her food and tell her you'll never open her fridge or touch her food again, but she is also not to touch the food in your fridge.  Let her keep her stuff for as long as she wants, and you can eat iced cream that is not 7 years old.  As long as she doesn't fill her fridge with garbage and start asking to put food in yours, great, no problem.  The second she has enough stuff in there that she asks to put something in your fridge, she is keeping too much crap and has to throw stuff away, she cannot keep more than an entire full refrigerator of food that you're not supposed to touch nor expect you to share when she will not.\n\nOf course that is a mildly insane solution to an insane problem and therapy for whatever is making her like this might be better, but she may not accept that and we play the hand we're dealt.

It not that difficult to respect such a simple boundary.", "maybe instead of just eating it, tell her that it's been there a while and offer to replace it after you eat it? or buy a new tub in the same flavour and replace it before eating it.\n\nI agree it's infuriating my wife does the same but the problem is when the food is gone and she doesn't know why, more than that the food is gone. In some ways I think she is still in her single girl mindset and hasn't quite adjusted to living in a house with other people... we've been living together for 14 years and have two kids.", "By \"pint\" I mean pint of ice cream.", "Fair enough - I suppose if you guys keep chatting you will get there"]}
