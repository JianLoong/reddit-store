This is Hoarding. Did your wife grow up in a home where they were poor and didn\u2019t have a lot of food? Was there trauma? Eating disorder? Some people hoard different things for many reasons. I would have a real live conversation about what is going on and if it is something that can\u2019t be worked out get her a cheap ass refrigerator off craigslist or Facebook marketplace even if it\u2019s a mini fridge and let her use that for things that she wants to put up . I don\u2019t really agree with encouraging this behavior, but if you want the middle ground, maybe that could be it. Her rotting food is going to affect the entire refrigerator.  It\u2019s unhealthy and frankly you shouldn\u2019t be eating old food either.", "ESH. She's being ridiculous and wasting valuable freezer space, but you are only reinforcing her insecurities by eating her special food.  She's worried she will be sad when it is gone and then you eat it and it's gone and she's sad.  How are you helping?\n\nThe solution is to eat and immediately replace. This may involve buying the replacement before you finish off the original.  If she realizes all of this food is not as special as she's making it out to be, she may soften her stance on turning your refrigerator into a time capsule.", "Let me clarify one thing: We have her/my food when we want different flavors. She'll get a pint in a flavor she likes, I'll get one in a flavor I like.\n\nIt's not like all our food is separate.", "This isn\u2019t about food, it\u2019s about control and boundaries.  I lived a similar thing for many years with my husband.\n\nFood was (and is) the most important thing in his life.  When we were first married, he ate practically everything I cooked, no matter how much I made.  I would put aside leftovers for work, and if i forgot it, he ate when he got home.  We fought about it A LOT and I couldn\u2019t make him see that he considered \u2018his\u2019 food his, and my food up for grabs.\n\n(Normal people share and have consideration, he was an only child who got everything and doesn\u2019t know what sharing MEANS.)\n\nFinally he started to ask, but in a way meant to guilt me into giving it to him - \u2018Are you going to eat that?\u2019 \u2019Yes\u2019.  \u2018When?  It\u2019s been there for 2 days.\u2018. \u2018I\u2019ll eat it when I want!\u2019  \u2018But it\u2019s going to go bad, are you sure you\u2019re going to eat it?\u2019.\n\nSeriously, it nearly ended our marriage.  I finally told him that my food was MINE and he wasn\u2019t to ask for it, or touch it and if he did, I was done.  If there was something I didn\u2019t want I would offer it, but otherwise SHUT THE F UP about it.  If something goes bad and gets tossed, LIVE WITH IT!\n\nSo OP, you may not like how your wife eats things, but that\u2019s NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.  If she buys herself something, ITS HERS.  You have no right to question how she eats, what she eats, or to take HER property.  Taking food you think she forgot is no different than taking electronics you think she doesn\u2019t use, or money that left sitting in her drawer.\n\nBottom line - ITS NOT YOURS!

It isn\u2019t actually about doing the dishes, and yes there is a reason behind that warning.", "OP, hubby and I do this with a lot of snacks, we have yours, mine, ours (adults only) and family (we have 3 kids). \n\nOur rule for the yours and mine is that you have a week to eat it then the other gets to ask for some whenever they want but if it's still there two weeks after that, then it's up for grabs (naturally this is flexible depending on the expiry time on the snack), but the key is to always ask permission before having any snack that isn't yours or finishing a shared snack so that when the other goes to get some they don't find it gone.\n\nMaybe you and your wife need to sit down and have a conversation like adults and come up with some ground rules because stealing food isn't any better than wasting food.", "It\u2019s not bad - it\u2019s just easier if everyone shares", "If she only eats a few bites here and there and then forgets about it to the point it goes bad, it\u2019s absolutely wasting money.", "That\u2019s absolutely not the least bit valid.", "When your mind runs on 'I have to make EVERYTHING last' logic, you don't see the stash as waste, because in a pinch, you would still eat it. That he considers it wasted once it's sub par doesn't mean she does.\n\nIt's a typical mindset for anyone from poverty (or other food scarcity backgrounds) and is really hard to break out of. Even if sensible brain knows you probably don't want crunchy, crystally ice-cream, stash brain says it will come in handy when you're having a tough day.", "If not for that, then at the very least she's still an asshole for getting mad at OP for eating that food that she was wasting.\n\nI also disagree with the other person who responded to you. A 'stash' based mindset might explain why she's doing this, but it doesn't mean she's not an asshole for wasting food.", "This is not the way to matrimonial harmony. No grown woman with her own money is going to defer to this.", "yeah ruin your marriage and demean your wife over it, epic idea. reddit gold to you sir", "Thank you for the word \u201csnaffles\u201d.", "So you read the post, decided that it painted the wife as an AH so you didn't want to believe it, invented your own reality that conveniently blames the man and then decided to go with that? \n\nWhy is AITA so desperate to shit on husbands", "Why surely? He's telling you how it works. It's totally normal and fine for couples to have some of their own treats.", "Do you mind me asking why you think that?\n\n(I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s a habit I should pick up as well)", "Yeah idk. I encourage my husband to eat the stuff I\u2019m not finishing in time. Food waste is horrible, and in this economy (i realize you may have a different economic situation but just in general) money waste is maddening. Too many people don\u2019t have enough money to pay for dinner for their kids and your wife is throwing food away because she cant learn to share or eat her food before it goes bad.", "Tbh I think technically you can keep some frozen foods longer than 3 months but I just like to start with a clean slate on a regular basis. I'm just a regular declutterer and minimalist in general, I'm like this in all areas of my home, work and life so it's pretty much a constant busy churn for me. \n\nI think the point I was making with that comment is that it must be impossible to work out exactly how long ANYTHING has been in that freezer if you're digging out half-eaten 7-year-old tubs of ice-cream. And if this kind of situation extends out into other areas of the OP's partner's physical space and life in general then she may well have an issue with hanging onto stuff, as other commenters have pointed out.", "My mom has an extra place for her treats and there is one place ffa. If she would put her treats in ffa, she wouldn't get any. Pa and me would eat them too quick. But if she had her treats too long in her place, she would put them in ffa. So nothing goes bad.\n\nIf your wife buys the snacks with HER money, not yours combined or whatever, then she can do what she wants with them. Still waste of food and space.\n\nAnd like others said: talk with her.\n\nAnd because I can't decide, i will say ESH (everyone sucks here? Correct me, if i am wrong.)", "Nah, if she doesnt eat it then someone else should. Common sense", "NAH what if, when she buys a snack for herself she labels it with a date that you can eat it and a date it should be thrown out?  That way she feels respected and you don\u2019t feel like you are wasting food.", "NTA. A refrigerator has limited space. If she is keeping expired cheese, milk, yogurt, etc, there will be less room for fresh items. Items that need to be refrigerated generally can also cause illness if eaten too long past due date. I would not appreciate getting food poisoning if my spouse made us dinner with a product that was spoiled. Although freezing food reduces the risk, the longer you keep frozen food, the greater the likelihood of a power outage that cycles it between frozen/thawed, which again could be dangerous to eat. In my opinion, food safety comes before ownership of the food. Limited refrigerator space being taken up with expired food is also an unfair use of space, as well as spoiled food can drip onto good food and contaminate the good food. \n\nYou could give her the choice of you either eating her food right before its due date, or you can throw it out. Keeping spoiled and long-expired food in the refrigerator is not an option.\n\nMy mother-in-law has spices in her cupboard from the 1980s so I feel some sympathy for you.", "Throw that \"ice cream\" out. \n\nIf it's 7 years old, then it is by no means safe to eat probably.", "NTA at the very least she is wasting space. Also she\u2019s insane", "Two Simple solutions, \n\n1. Remind your wife if you notice something is going out of date. Then ask her if shes okay with you eating it. \nSometimes people buy things because they crave them at the time then forget they are there, especially if they have a stressful day, are super busy or the person is anxious. \n\n2. If you eat something replace it. Make sure its the same as the one you ate, do not eat fancy cake from a specialised store then replace it with grocery store generic whatever.\n\nIf your wife doesn't like either of these options then there's a bigger issue here and one that may need to be talked through.", "If it's a treat that makes her feel good about having available so she doesn't eat large amounts at once, leave it alone. If you want some, ask. Open your mouths and talk already.", "INFO - Does your wife have any experience with food insecurity?", "YTA  \nYour wife has a weird quirk about hoarding food.  Maybe there is trauma, maybe she starved in a past life.  We all have quirks.  Why can\u2019t you just leave it alone rather than constantly go after her food?  You\u2019re annoying AF.\n\n  \nYou aren\u2019t starving.  Maybe learn to be accepting of a quirk instead.  Leave her food alone.", "If she's spending her own money on special food just for her than yea yta", "Not just money, but food!", "She needs therapy if she seriously kept a container of ice cream for SEVEN YEARS. That's bizarre.", "Oh my lord the \"one or two bites\" left annoys the ever loving hooey out of me. I throw it out. My husband says \"it's still good\" then NEVER goes back to it. I toss it, wash it and ignore any complaints. I have spoken til I am blue that it's disrespectful to leave one bite of ice cream. It disappoints the next person ffs lol.", "> when I see she's completely forgotten about something that I know she'll just let go bad, I eat it.\n\nIf you see she's completely forgotten about something ... why not ask her about it? Then she can either remember about it and eat it herself, or give you permission to eat it. \n\nI grew up with some level of food insecurity. We usually had enough to keep us fed, but rarely snacks outside of that. I would hoard my Halloween candy and ration it out to last the whole year because I didn't know if I would get any other candy (even though by the end of the year some of it was downright gross). I still do that with some things I'm particularly fond of. Having someone throw away (or eat) a treasured item is jarring and hurtful when you could just use your words.", "Cf Iranian yogurt.", "I would actually question the quantity of food that she \u2018wastes\u2019. I mean who \u2018wastes\u2019 more food, a person who buys fresh ice cream each week or the woman that has kept a freezer-burnt ice cream for the last 7 years by eating a little bit at a time.", "She\u2019s had the same tub of icecream for SEVEN YEARS!! Even seven months is an extremely long time to keep a single tub of icecream. There is eating in moderation and making your food last, and then there is this extreme. She needs therapy", "This. My husband will eat ALL of anything unless I specifically tell him that I bought it for me. That has limits though, and if I haven\u2019t finished it in a week it becomes fair game (he usually asks first). I think OP needs to have a talk with his wife about her food hoarding tendencies.", "Because if you ask its \"I'm saving it for later\" and then later never seems to come.", "I think you're a bit confused here. What you've written is a possible explanation for this behavior. However, an explanation is not the same thing as an excuse. You can do an asshole thing that is very explainable based on your background. It's still an asshole thing to do.", "Every post here is biased because it's one person's perspective and they can only give one side of the story. Him giving the 7 year old ice cream story shows me just how far he's willing to twist things to make himself look better. It really doesn't have shit to do with the gender of the parties involved, but if it makes you feel better to think so because you want to believe the obviously false narrative, go for it. LOL!", "I'm not convinced privately purchasing a not-excessive amount of treat food and then not eating it at a satisfactory pace is an asshole behaviour though.\n\nAnnoying, sure. Disordered, probably but asshole? She's not actually hurting anyone, or causing harm incidentally. She's just being an oddball in a way that isn't all that uncommon.", "I get not liking food waste, but a little of her $5 pint of ice cream going bad isn't why people are going hungry.", "I didnt mean to imply it was. Merely that his wife is being selfish and wasteful for no real reason"]}
