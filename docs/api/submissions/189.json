Now back to the matter at hand, as the triangle guard, they're known to be the ones with the weapons and they eliminate the rule breakers or the players who fail their task, that's literally their job, so I wanted to be more into the role of the character and I got a nerf gun, the model is the Fortnite BASR-L Bolt Action that I spray painted black and have added some pink, logos, symbols, even a quote from the show on it. However, my stepdad says that if I bring it with trick or treating, I'll be putting his grandkid in danger because it looks too much like a real gun. Well, its supposed to look like a gun first of all, second, I've customized it and I doubt anyone will see a squid game soldier with a black and pink gun with paper logos taped onto it threatening. My mom takes his side like always and she tells me I need to leave it.\n\nHere's the thing, I'm currently jobless without any income because I was in the hospital 3 different times from emotional distress, I wont go into detail because this post is long enough, and this gun with the supplies costed over $40 and I have very little money but I wanted this Halloween to be just as fun as my other ones with my costumes but this $40 is a lot of money to me with no income, since it was already painted, I can't return it and it's basically $40 completely wasted.\n\nI've asked my step sister and she says it's fine and her husband is actually encouraging me to bring it, I've told a friend and she says that I'm in the right to be upset and that I'm old enough and I don't need to be told what to do by my parents. But I want to see what other people will think, maybe I'm in the wrong and if I am, I need help understanding why. So, am I the asshole if I bring a nerf gun trick or treating?\n\nAlso the area we live in is mostly LDS families and college students, so It's not like there's sketchy activity or anything like that.\n\nEdit: Just from the few comments from the last few minutes alone have helped me see why its a bad idea, I'm going to leave the gun at home and I'm going to apologize to my mom and step-dad for thinking their concerns were invalid.

When you cosplay, there are all sorts of rules around weapons that you have to follow, especially these days. Every convention will have a weapons policy with very clear instructions on how to make it exceedingly clear that your weapon isn't real. And they will still require you to get the weapon prop checked out by security. \n\nThese policies are in place for everyone's safety.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you're following the standard gun protocol (orange tip). There's no security force that's going to be looking for a tag that it's approved. There's just people out in the dark who will see a person in a jumpsuit & hood with her face obscured carrying a gun. There is absolutely a chance that someone will mistake it for a real gun in the dark. (Or, hell, in the light too.)
