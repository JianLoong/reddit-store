Why the fuck should you tip this person? Sure, they may have to pay a chair fee and incur other costs (hair products, equipment, etc.), but still, they're making good money on price alone, don't need a tip. \n\nAmerica's tip culture is insane and has only gotten worse since the pandemic.

You continue going to him I assume because he does a good job and you like his service. So you should reflect that in the tip. Tipping $1 is definitely an insult.

It's the perfect way to express your opinion on the quality of service you receive.

Reducing it because you're already paying him more for the same service anyway is also ok.  \n\nMaybe it's beyond his control.  Maybe he's just an employee who doesn't keep a direct percentage of what he's charging and just gets a flat rate, and thus he depends more on the tip.  But in that case, the price increase is an issue he needs to take up with his employer as it's costing him money.  He doesn't need to be harassing you about it.  He's probably frustrated because other customers are responding the same way, and he's seeing his pay effectively cut as a result, which is worse since inflation is just making it worse on both ends (his money is worth less, and people probably are tipping less because of it)\n\nAnd don't be afraid to shop around for a new barber if that's how you're being treated.", "NTA..

Neither of your perspectives are necessarily wrong, but it would have been nice if he opened up communications in a less aggressive way, especially considering that you\u2019re a long-time customer. Then again, he may consider you to be a stingy customer who has a history of not tipping well, and so he\u2019s expressing his frustration with what he thinks is deliberate rude behavior on your part. \n\nI\u2019m a hairstylist, and most of my customers tip $5-10 per haircut. I work at a chain salon, where haircuts are $20, and my hourly wage is $12. The number of haircuts I do each hr depends a lot on traffic flow, but if at minimum I get one haircut with $5 tip per hr, then that brings my hourly wage to $17, which is mostly livable. So, while I won\u2019t begrudge one or two customers that leave no tip, it\u2019s not great, and a whole day of low tips can impact my finances. For a regular customer that requests me, I\u2019d expect to to at least leave a $5 tip, if not more. A frequent customer that leaves a $0-1 tip is kind of confusing and frustrating, like, it seems like they like my work, but not enough to give a non-negligible tip? And then everytime they request me, I know I\u2019ll essentially be losing out on a tip, since the time I spend on them could have gone to another customer that would tip better.\n\nYour barber is charging twice as much as I do for haircuts, which could mean that he\u2019s providing a higher level of service than chain salons. I\u2019m pretty sure most of his customers tip 25-50%. Does he own his own salon, rent a chair in someone\u2019s salon, or is he still being paid a lower hourly wage? If he doesn\u2019t own the salon, then the $45 goes partly to the salon owner and he may be more reliant on tips.\n\nIf you want, just talk with him about what he thinks is fair for tipping. Explain your reasoning for how you\u2019ve tipped in the past, and ask him if that\u2019s how he sees tipping for hairstylists should go. And then if you don\u2019t mind going more with what he wants, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be happy to continue having you as a customer. Most hairstylists are reasonable ppl who deal with a wide range of customers\u2019 personalities, so you probably aren\u2019t the worst customer they\u2019ve seen that week, or even that day, lol. And if your finances are such that you can only tip on the lower end, then maybe he\u2019ll be alright with it once you give him some background. You aren\u2019t obligated to explain yourself to your barber, but sometimes just hearing that a customer appreciates your work and didn\u2019t mean to be stingy/rude, can make things alright.", "YTA. You should tip your barber. And he\u2019s right, $1 tip is like you\u2019re mocking him. Give him a real tip or don\u2019t", "NTA, this tipping bullshit is getting out of control! Unless he's making under minimum wage, there's no reason to tip! Tipping is a courtesy, not a requirement!", "NTA take his advise and just dont tip at all if he's gonna message like that", "I get a father and son haircut for me and the boy, it's \u20ac33 and I round to 35.  And my barber always says thanks. \n\nI'd just never, ever use a barber or any service taht Valle dme out on a tip but then again we have a vastly different culture on this in Europe.", "I pay about $60 CAD for hair and beard, and that's the price at every decent barber in Vancouver and surrounding suburbs. That comes out to almost exactly $45 USD. Just the way the world is now.", "Sometimes it\u2019s worth it if you find a good barber tbh. I\u2019m not from the US so I can\u2019t speak about that, but where I\u2019m from a hair cut is like 300, and trimming facial hair is like 100, 200 at most. I pay 300 for trimming facial hair only, and if I want a haircut it\u2019s another 900 which is insanity.\n\nBut I\u2019ve never been to a barber as good as him, and people kept messing up my hair and facial here, so it\u2019s worth it to me.", "He already started charging more.", "Anyone that has ever worked in the service industry where tips are customary, it's not about wanting more money necessarily. It's just that getting a 1 dollar tip is seen as almost an insult and it's better for a customer to just not leave a tip, especially if they're a regular.\n\nIf OP goes once every 2 weeks, then that 1 dollar tip means the barber gets an extra 26 dollars a year from OP, which is pretty much negligible in the grand scheme of things.", "UK here, get my (woman's) hair cut for \u00a315 and no expectation of a tip. Admittedly, I have a simple style and it doesn't take long, but there seems to be a lot of people paying a lot of money for haircuts.", "German here. I always tip my hairdresser.", "Yeah I'm not giving out any judgment here, just weirded out by tipping culture as usual", "43 dollars for a haircut is high? damn as a woman i frequently spend $80+ getting my hair cut", "And by that logic restaurant waiters don't have to go to school, so that means should not tip waiters", "As someone from the UK who has recently come back from an all inclusive holiday we would never have dreamed of tipping the staff each time we got a drink. As someone else has said it has to be exceptional service to warrant a tip. We did give a tip at the end of our two week holiday to one specific bar tender who remembered our order everyday. So therefore gave us exceptional service. The tipping culture in the US is just bizarre to us!", "How is not tipping messing with their income? They knew when they started the job that tips are exactly that a tip. Not to be expected. When you work in the service industry you shouldn't base your life on tips. Not everyone will.", "Where I live that's over 17e and way above the min wage.", "50 FOR A TIP WTF", "Out of curiosity, what country are you from because in Australia you would really only tip that much at a restaurant?", "So charge what your license is worth? Why would you surrender yourself to the kindness of others to get what you deserve?", "Sorry but what currency is this?", "You're paying 1.2k for a beard trim and haircut?", "It may sound stupid, but sometimes, no tip is better than a incredibly small tip. I've been taught to never leave spare change as tip, as it can be insulting or demeaning to the servers.", "F that, at this point he has two options, tip more or find another barber. The two people you don't fuck with are the people cooking your meal and the people cutting your hair.", "Why should he tip at all? Why isn't salary built into the cost of the cut?", "Tips are for service above and beyond.\n\nHe's not even providing a level service.", "Yeah, and he's being paid well for it. What's your point?", "Tip me money for taking time to reply to you aswell then you moronic incel\nTipping is the dumbest invention ever. Youre already paying for the service, whats this gratitude pay? Laughable\n\nI guess youre american", "Sorry. Do you tip your plumber? Dental hygienist? Therapist? All those people went to school and don't have tipping policies nor expectations.\n\nOP, I was told that if the stylish has their own business, nor someone working for a larger salon, you don't tip. Being their own business owner means they set their rates and can adjust accordingly. He did as much when he raised his rates. I'd follow his advice and not tip.", "Literally do not understand your attitude on this at all. He should charge what he thinks his service is worth. Problem solved.", "And that\u2019s exactly why his prices, the things he has control over and can decide for himself, can be increased to reflect all that. \n\nA tip is an entirely voluntary thing a customer CAN choose to provide based solely on what they experienced. It isn\u2019t mandatory or an obligation, it\u2019s something to be provided on top of the price of something to demonstrate someone going above and beyond the clients expectations. \n\nThe barber shouldn\u2019t even be getting a tip if they\u2019ve been late, therefore not even fulfilling the basic requirements of the appointment, let alone getting arsey and asking for more!", "There are tons of jobs that people went to school for. There are tons of jobs that require a trade. They get paid, they don\u2019t beg for tips. And if the barber works 40 hour weeks all year, at $45 a cut, he\u2019s making 90k. There are people with doctorates that make less than that.", "Yeap and all of those people in my country set their own wages if they own the business. Tipping is as  dumb as your mums offspring", "Sounds like they went to school for the wrong thing if they\u2019re still scrounging for tips. I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll go to school to be a server or a taxi driver.", "Someone also put their prices up 50%", "omg, where do you go? I got my hair trimmed a couple of years ago and it was \u00a335! I've been doing it myself ever since, at least I can still eat afterwards even if I don't like it, haha.", "Me too, but just if they do a really good job. Most of my hairdressers also know me being a student. Some don't even accept my tip.", "Lol I wish it was only $80. These guys are crying over $50? Lololololol.", "It shouldn't exist. Its holdover form the post slavery days when white people didnt want to give black people a wage. Hence tipping culture for waiters and bartenders\n Its been kept because it means business owners dont need to pay their staffs living wage.\n There are places in the US where the min wage is under $2.50. It's a disgusting practice, and it shouldn't be allowed to make it's way over here.", "I\u2019m a bartender. We get paid waaay less than minimum wage because it is expected we will be tipped. In some states, the server/bartender wage is $2.13/hour. We also HAVE to tip bar backs/doormen/hosts a percentage of what we sell- whether we get tipped or not. If a table with a big bill stiffs me, I basically have to pay for waiting on them.\n\nI don\u2019t know the pay rate for barbers, but usually if it is customary to tip, there\u2019s a very good reason.\n\nI know it\u2019s not a great system, but don\u2019t take it out on people who are working hard to make a living and provide you services. Most of us are not doing these jobs because it was our childhood dream. We\u2019re trying to survive. We\u2019re not degenerates or losers. I did very well in school- but I graduated during the 2008 housing collapse.\n\nMust be nice to sit on your high-horse with your health care and 401k and get to feel superior to everyone who makes your life more convenient.", "$50 total, I believe they meant.", "Whereas for us in England, you generally just round up to the nearest pound or fiver. \n\nHow can any tip be an insult? Extra mo wy is extra money.", "Whoever is insulted by \"spare change\" is an idiot. Even a fraction of the currency as a tip, is something you gained without working, since a tip is not your salary, it's extra money.", "I was also taught this, although lately I rarely use cash, and many business have tip screens, or even provide tip percentages on the receipt.  I leave a lot of change that way. It's easier to hit the one button than punch in a whole dollar amount.\n\n\nI", "Yeah one time the service was horrendous (like we had to wait hours for drinks and stuff) and my grandma gave a 2 euro tip on a 300 euro bill just to let them know (we live in europe where tippinh isn't mandatory as servers get proper wages", "Also the barber might have to pay chair fees and those might have gone up which made him increase his prices just so he could make the same as before (my sibling is a barber and just recently had to do this.)\n\nBut the barber shouldn\u2019t be late, and I couldn\u2019t imagine texting someone about a tip.", "His lack of proper English grammar in the text he sent is evidence he lacks professionalism or any type of culture.", "Sounds like it to me. Barber has a cheek!", "Do you get a haircut every two weeks? That is what OP does.", "Pink tax!\n\nAlso, the client before you might have been more demanding/taken longer than expected. A haircut can take longer than expected, just like a doctors appointment. No way for him to control it. You don\u2019t get to pay the doc less for being late- and they usually are.", "servers only make 2.15 an hour in most states  so yeah it is there salary , if youre leaving loose change as a tip dont go out to eat at a sit down place goto McDonalds", "And?!", "Then he should charge more and be on time, not late every single time", "Or... you don't pay the dr at all if you don't live in the usa AND in this case, I agree that you can't be upset at delays.\n\nIf you pay someone handsomely and they are late, they should offer a discount. Whether it is a chef or a surgeon. It is called customer service.", "But you never tip your doctor, even when he saves your life.", "You\u2019re welcome to feel that way, but that\u2019s not reality for customers in the US. It\u2019s shitty to not pay people for helping you, even though they principally should be fully paid by employers.", "And the cycle continues and employers continue to get away with not paying their workers properly.", "We are talking about a barber, not a waiter. That barber makes $43 per 45 minunes. Also fir the waitstaff, as another commenter already said, if you keep tipping to supplement their non-existent salary, the bosses will never pay them what they deserve and frankly, the waitstaff will never care to fight for rightful compensation.", "Who says he doesn't own it", "Please let me know if your country will let me immigrate.\n\nSeriously. Would love to see a Dr.\n\nSometimes the train is late/too crowded to board too- does the subway/bus system give you a discount on the fare in your country? \n\nI\u2019ll move tomorrow.", "Not trying to be rude. I apologize if it came off that way.\n\nI really do want to gth out of here.", "He/she is also likely extravagantly rich, unless they\u2019ve mishandled their funds.\nTips are for those who don\u2019t make $500,000/year.\nHaven\u2019t had my life saved by a doctor (knock on wood), but have been talked down to, dismissed, and insulted. Still had to pay the full bill- no discount for terrible service. Much bigger bill than the barber too.", "yee for sure screwing over waitstaff and wasting there time fore sure changes labor laws for tipped labor keep it up champ", "the parent comment of the reply im replying to literally says servers in it", "The barber doesn\u2019t make the price he charges unless he\u2019s the owner, and if he\u2019s the owner he has to pay rent and other bills. He may have no say in what he charges.", "Better to let bosses continue to mistreat their workers and do nothing about it. Tipping culture instead of wages is a uniquely American thing, sort it out like the rest of us do and don't shame people for not wanting to subsidise the profits of buisness owners.", "Yes, servers, not waitstaff. Hair cuts are a service. \"Server\" has a broad meaning", "yea show those waiters whos boss i guess ?", "you tell someone your a server what do they think they mean?", "How about shaming the bosses and the industry itself as they the ones too cheap to pay their staff properly!"]}
