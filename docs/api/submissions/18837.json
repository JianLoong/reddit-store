Yes cost of living went up. For everyone, not just him. Your costs to.", "NTA and anyone saying different is a leech , 43 dollars for a regular haircut is high but unfortunately the going rate , your tip at making it 45 is FAIR , why should you be expected to tip 20% ?the cost of living has gone up for EVERYONE not just the barber . You should be able to get your haircut without it being a 50 dollar endeavor every time . Let\u2019s not forget op said he comes in LATE, If anything money should be taken off your cut , if op was late he wouldn\u2019t even get his deposit BACK. Why is it different for him? and op is expected to add a tip on top of it ? Hairdressers need to stop this shit , they\u2019ll tack on a late fee if your 10 minutes late but these mfs can be 30 minutes to an hour and you get no accommodation for it just a sorry , I\u2019ve had it happen to me numerous times , it\u2019s bs . An guess what? they ain\u2019t get no fcking tip after it . He\u2019s also rude asf no matter if he doesn\u2019t like the tip it\u2019s distasteful to text you that, find a new barber who\u2019s on time , and respectful .", "NTA.

We all noticed that their wrist bands were a different colour from ours, all of us couldn\u2019t figure out why.  Went to dinner that evening and we (without them) were discussing the difference in the bands still trying to figure it out when a couple next to us said it because they are from the UK and their culture is not to tip, the bar staff knows who they will get tips from.  I was shocked, never told the couple because I thought it was insulting and so incredibly wrong.", "You need to tip your barber? What? If he wants more money, he can just up his prices, can't he? \n\nSeems so weird to me, but then I'm not living in the USA so that's probably why.", "NTA", "NTA. This tipping culture has outlived its purpose. You are paying a pretty penny already for the service.", "NTA - A regular haircut at the barber I go to is $26 in a medium-high cost of living city. $43 for a 45 minute regular haircut is INSANE. That comes to a little over $57 an hour, or an annual salary of roughly $119K a year (based only on a regular haircut, anything extra would obviously increase this amount). Why the fuck should you tip this person? Sure, they may have to pay a chair fee and incur other costs (hair products, equipment, etc.), but still, they're making good money on price alone, don't need a tip. \n\nAmerica's tip culture is insane and has only gotten worse since the pandemic. Next thing you know you'll need to tip your electrician, plumber, gardener, accountant, mechanic and anyone else who provides a service.", "They almost doubled their prices for the same service, I\u2019d consider that their tip. NTA.", "NTA i dont think you need to tip when he sets his prices. \n\nBut I do have a question for all the people saying y t a out of total curiosity, you say he should tip because the barber went to school to learn how to do it. So in that case do you tip your accountant at the end of every session? Or your divorce lawyer? Or your doctor? Or your bus driver? Or your dentist? They all had to go to school/get training etc? Genuine question.", "YTA  that's tipping like 2%. His prices have gone up over 4 years because the cost of living has gone up. He's a business not a charity. So his prices shouldn't be a factor. You continue going to him I assume because he does a good job and you like his service. So you should reflect that in the tip. Tipping $1 is definitely an insult. Isn't the generally accepted tip amount around 10%? Surely if you can afford going to a barber every 2 weeks for 4 years you can afford more than a $1 tip. Loyalty is great, but it doesn't pay the bills.", "yta, unless you are literally going broke.  that is a really, really insultingly low tip.", "YTA. Tipping should be 10-15% for good service, 20%+ if you can afford it and you really loved the service. You tipped at the rate of \"the service was crap and I hate you but feel bad not leaving anything\"", "***YTA*** No Question. $1 on a +$40 service is absolutely an insult \n\nYou shouldn't be tipping that person any less than $8. Especially if you have been going to the same person for *years*.\n\nHell, I just started with the Barber I go to about a year about. I get a Hight/Tight skin fade with a Beard trim/sculpt every 3 weeks. $40 for the Service. Straight $50.\n\n\nIf I happen to go somewhere special like a Hammer and Nails and pay for a premium Shave (straight razor, hot towel...the true works)...that alone is $80... and that person is getting $20  for a tip.\n\nYou are 31??????  Yeah, YTA.", "YTA - prices vary based on the community and economy. With inflation and going to a card system his prices went up bc he is incurring more charges elsewhere. Tipping should always be 15-20% if you can afford it and the service was good as tipping is usually their means to extra income.  If you don\u2019t like the price go elsewhere and see how someone else\u2019s service compares. You might see the value in tipping then", "YTA\n\nYada yada tipping culture sucks, yada yada. But yeah $1 is an insult. You should give him at least $50, which would still be a small tip, but wouldn\u2019t be totally insulting.", "YTA. \n\n20% is standard. Now you know.", "YTA. I tip a bartender $2 per drink. \nA proper tip for your barber who went to school, then put in over 1000 hours of work before taking exams to get his LICENSE, and now pays station rent\u2026would be $10. If that\u2019s too much, go to SuperCuts. Remember, you get what you pay for.", "Yup. YTA! Times are a'chang", "YTA. Cut your own hair if you that cheap.

However, I assume this is in NA, then there is an expected minimum level of tip depending on where you're from (yes - tipping culture is stupid af and I think people should just charge what they think they deserve for their services, but it's a deeply entrenched societal norm here). Where I'm from the barest minimum is 10-15%.  Sure, tip is voluntary, but socially it's mandatory. My personal rule is if I can't afford to pay the service price + expected tip, then I can't afford it. It's like I'm assuming the tip is part of the price. Your barber isn't wrong for feeling slighted by your tip. Previously you'd have been tipping at 10-15% but this $1 tip is a 2% tip.", "My super weird habit is if you are going to small tip at all, give them about the cost of a pack of Marlboros.

Also if you increase your price 20% the way that barber did I\u2019m considering your tip cause I\u2019m not paying 40% more for the same service I had a few months ago if you\u2019re gonna disrespect my time. \n\n\nI\u2019m just waiting for greedy assholes to destroy the tipping system, because even people who traditionally have tipped 20% or more are getting tired of the games.", "\"I charge $43 for a haircut\"\n\n\"Here you go $43, have a nice day!\"\n\n\"Where the hell do you get off only giving me what i asked for!!!\"", "Wait, since when are barbers getting tipped?

YTA.  Make space for a customer who appreciates him. This isn't just a skilled service. It's an art. You're not paying him to cut off your hair. you're paying him to know where and in what quantity and what and where to leave. Anyone can just cut off hair. 4 year Olds do it all the time.", "Respectfully, I\u2019m going to disagree. \n\nYou should tip servers and bartenders who don\u2019t make livable wages without it, absolutely. \n\n\nBut vendors who have the freedom to choose their own prices so that they can live comfortably? Absolutely should not be necessary.", "Its not food service. The barber set a fee.", "If the barber upped his price to $45, would you be saying straight $55 or straight $57?", "You said tip 15-20% if the service was good.

Yet they\u2019ll be the first ones to tack on a late fee if your running 10 mins behind , Chile please .", "Even if he tipped 0% he would still be NTA. The true trade and their skill is reflected in the amount he charges.", "I am UK, and I was taught that a tip is not a necessity but a way to show appreciation for goint the extra mile.
