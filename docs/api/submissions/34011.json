And, while we\u2019ve been trying our best to create a harmonious environment, a recent incident has caused some tension.\n\nThe other day, we had a family gathering at our house, and I took a candid photo of the event. In the background of the picture, my toddler is visible, while his big brother isn\u2019t (not on purpose; I didn\u2019t even realize my toddler was in it himself). I posted the picture on social media without giving it much thought, as it was a sweet moment.\n\nHowever, shortly after posting, my stepson approached me and expressed his hurt feelings. He told me that seeing the picture made him feel excluded and unimportant. He felt like I was intentionally highlighting his brother and neglecting him. I was taken aback by his reaction, and tried to reassure him that it was an innocent oversight/that my love for both my boys is equal, but he remained upset.\n\nNow, here\u2019s where I may have messed up: I never took down the post. Those we couldn\u2019t make it to our family event had already commented on/liked it, with my MIL having even reposted it. While I did understand my son\u2019s feelings, I didn\u2019t really see the point in deleting it, since it had already had its own fair share of traction (and, doubly: my son and I had already had our above chat).\n\nApparently, later, my son brought it up to my wife, though, and she\u2014out of curiosity\u2014decided to check my account, which still showcased the image. She (rather understandably, honestly) proceeded to get angry with me, telling me that it wouldn\u2019t have killed me to just delete the post.\n\nI did end up taking it down, but my wife still seems to think of me as the AH for not doing it straight after our son brought it up.

It takes a lot for a 12 yo boy to talk to his new stepfather. It may seem insignificant or as an oversight to you, but to him it meant more and he even came to talk to you about it.

You wanted notoriety?", "Soft YTA - should have added extra photos that included step-son", "Soooo, 12 yo stepson has a sm account and thought a \u201ccandid\u201d photo was hurtful because he wasn\u2019t in the picture but the toddler was and it made him feel \u201cexcluded\u201d \u201cunimportant\u201d and you were \u201cpurposely highlighting\u201d your son. This is pretty complex for a 12 so there a lot more going on than just this situation. Is it possible wife put these idea in 12 yo\u2019s head? These are pretty deep feelings for a kid that age unless you excluding stepson is a pattern. And then to not take it down makes me suspect there is a lot more going on here. I need more information to vote", "NTA - you're still in the process of establishing your long term relationship with your new son. That's gonna take time. Soft suggest that you maybe set up a day of the week that's specific to older son, if you haven't already (play video games, play or coach a sport he enjoys together, sign up for stuff like rock climbing, go for a drive and bullshit for a while,  etc). Your little munchkin shouldn't be too heart broken over one day of less focus at his present age, and then you can do the same with him as he gets older. But for now the one day of focus per week on older son may help him relax in to knowing you're there for him even when not actively spending time with him.\n\nIf he continues to be this upset over the general minutiae of life where sometimes you take more pictures of littles, because hey that's gonna happen with him hitting first milestones kind of yearly for a while (riding a bike, first day of school, first lost tooth, etc)... then maybe some solo and family counciling should be considered. So that your older son knows he's cared for, but not your sole focus as you have two sons. If he's used to being an only child, that can take some time to adjust to. He didn't have the 9 month lead up of his mom being pregnant to get used to the idea, instead it was nebulous until y'all moved in together and got married.", "YTA. It was an act of good faith for this 12 year old to open himself up to you instead of simply withdrawing and assuming you didn't care. Yes, you explained how you were not trying to leave him out, but he's not an adult acquaintance, he is a kid, and a new son to you, understandably vulnerable to feeling left out. You should have immediately made it better by deleting the post and/or putting something inclusive of him up in its place. You will not get endless chances to maintain trust with him\u2014and you blew this one.", "NTA. Not everything is about him, honestly. And I suspect your wife has something to do with this behavior.", "YTA. Your stepson came to you to discuss his feelings, you said you understood but your actions didn't back that up. 'I didn't see the point in deleting it'.. It made your stepson feel left out. There's the point.", "NTA. Your toddler isn\u2019t gonna be in every picture with older son and vice versa. This was a good opportunity to explain that as well as what you had already told him. Are you always gonna have to walk on egg shells when it comes to what you do with or post of your son? That\u2019s exhausting. I, as a mother, couldn\u2019t handle that personally. And he is 3, he isn\u2019t gonna be little for much longer. No way I\u2019d delete a picture of my baby that would be added to my memories.", "This is the most gentle of YTAs that I could ever say - and it is almost NAH, but the fact that this photo did what \"family\" photos tend to do around the holidays on SM (get circulated/make the rounds among family members) and you knew your stepson was insecure about it in the first place, was a preventable heartache. \n\nNone of this is done out of malice. And it is not really, I think, that you are even prioritizing your biological son - the fact that he was in this photo, was incidental. But the fact of the matter is that you have a stepson who genuinely wants to be included in your family unit (which is a huge thing, not all stepchildren are ready, now or ever, to take that step) and seems to want to have a connection to you (again, this is not something to take for granted). You should be very careful not to burn that bridge - even a second's perusal of AITA for stepchild woes can show you this is an issue that is fraught with peril. \n\nWe're coming up on the new year: consider taking a family photo and make a post on SM celebrating *all* members of your family. Spend some time one on one with your stepson. He sounds like he might be a little insecure about where he fits in your family unit and these overtures could be considered as him reaching out seeking reassurance.\n\nPlease reassure him, OP. Please help him feel valued and cherished. Think of the photo situation/conversation as a symptom of a greater condition - and you have the opportunity, now, to treat it and lay a foundation that hopefully will help ensure stability and security in the future, once he really understands that he is loved and has a space in your family unit.", "NTA.\n\n\n1st of all it wasn't a family picture where you cut him out or excluded him from.\n\n\nThis sounds like only the beginning of the issues you will have with your step son and wife.\n\nWill he always expect to be in every photo your son is in that you post? Will your wife be angry if you don't bow down to her sons emotions?\n\n\nLet's be honest,  as much as your trying to have her son be like your own, this situation shows me that she and her son, dont see your son that way.  Her son sees a toddler as a competitor for dads affection.  A toddler in the background of a candid photo shouldn't result in him getting upset and her angry making you delete it.  What happens if you want to take your son to do something just the 2 of you, and then you post a picture.  Imagine the hell that would rain down over you doing something with just your son and then posting about it.\n\nI'd have a big talk with her about expectations here.", "NTA; kid needs to man up, your wife is babying him.\n\nThere\u2019s expressing his feelings and then there\u2019s sulking and whining.", "Proud of mr 12. Been comfortable to express himself to you and tell you how your post made him feel that took courage - what did you do with knowing how you made him feel\n\nDo your actions follow your words tho.

Then you could post it up alongside the old one or have it replace the old one (if that's what the older kid was specifically asking for). There's no reason you can't send the old photo later to anyone who specifically requests it for an album or something. You married into this family. You need to start acting like a parent to both kids, not just the one.", "NTA\nHow is this prioritising your bio son? Next they will make a problem for you handling the needs of your 3 year old cause he still is too young to do some things.", "NTA. This wasn\u2019t a formal photo where he was purposely excluded. Sounds like it was a party photo your toddler happened to be in the background of. The issue isn\u2019t the photo, it\u2019s stepson feeling insecure about his place in the family with you.

You could post a photo just with the 2 of you with the caption being about how lucky you are to have such a great stepson.", "What social media is a 12 year old on?", "YTA. Your stepson let you know that he was hurt and you still kept the pic online. Take it down, apologize, and post a really nice picture of your stepson.", "NTA, but I think you need to make a concerted effort to make your stepson feel included and important. Can you take him to do something on a regular basis, just the two of you, so he feels like he's important to you?", "YTA for not taking it down. It may have had some traction, but it can always gain a lot more. By not taking it down yourself it showed to him you really didn't value his feelings. Right now when blending families you absolutely must be vigilant that he doesn't feel alienated, replaced or that there is favoritism. This is an extremely critical time.\n\nHe was being honest and open with you, that is a great sign in a relationship, but you have to respond appropriately by showing you take his feelings seriously. He needs to know that now more than ever.", "NTA.  Your stepson overreacted to a photo.  There was no intent to exclude him or even to include your bio son.  Therefore, you didn't prioritize your bio son.  \n\nYour wife is also being unreasonable, validating your stepson's overreaction and encouraging such ridiculous jealous behavior.", "NTA.\n\nBut an obvious thing to do seems to be to post a picture with him in it.", "NTA, but I'd do a special post with your stepson.  Make it not obvious like he just got new shoes or you two did something together and had fun.  Take him for ice cream and do a selfie.", "NTA, but there\u2019s no way your love for the boys is equal, and a 12 year old is old enough to realize that. You telling him that tells him that you\u2019re capable of lying to him. You don\u2019t have to falsely assure him of the equality of your love for both of them. He just has to know you love him.", "Nta\n\nNot only pictures where people are not in will happen all the time\n\nSecond, it could have been a problem to post your step son without his father's consent as well\n\nHe needs to understand that people can respect his feelings but it doesn't entitle him to block people from doing things", "NAH.\n\nI think you messed up, but not to the level of being TA.

You are blessed with a pre-teen who politely *shared his feelings with you*, and expressed hurt. Obviously, you can\u2019t stick to perfect, balanced photos of both boys forever, but *right now* your step-son was asking for extra reassurance in the fragile new family. He\u2019s having very normal pre-teen insecurity, and doing an honestly amazing job of expressing it. You just missed an opportunity to reinforce that behaviour.\n\nYou aren\u2019t TA, but definitely neither is he.

The 12 y.o.  became I think overly upset and remained so even when it was explained by you that you didn't take the picture with excluding him in mind.  That all being said, I think the picture was a catalyst for a deeper problem between you two.  Have you been favoring one over the other?  Don't know but you two need to get to the bottom of what really prompted him to get upset and remain so.

His mum is protective and perhaps also feeling a bit unsure about how everything is going to work. The only answer to this is communication. Sit down with your whole family and chat through it.

Tell them that sometimes things might not feel fair because that happens in all families. Sometimes someone gets a special experience or is more in focus on a photo, sometimes someone else gets to celebrate something important or gets a treat. It evens out in the end and everyone needs to know that when it\u2019s one person\u2019s lucky or happy moment, that doesn\u2019t mean anyone else is less loved.
