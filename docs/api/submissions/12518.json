It was hard to say goodbye, but I work at a law firm now and am extremely happy and love everyone around me. \n\nI was talking on the phone with my mom (60F) this morning and she brought up the topic of teachers getting raises. I told her I think it\u2019s amazing because teachers do so much and have to put up with even more, the least they deserve is a raise. This set her off, as she works for the state as well and thinks it\u2019s beyond unfair teachers are getting a raise and she\u2019s not because they \u201cwork for the same people.\u201d I told her that it\u2019s not fair to compare jobs and pay when they aren\u2019t even in the same department (she is a court reporter and has already had over 20 days off of her job this year, not including weekends). \n\nThe argument escalated, to the point where she was shit talking teachers saying they \u201cwine about working and get summers off so they shouldn\u2019t complain.\u201d I snapped. I yelled at her and said \u201cmom no wonder I didn\u2019t want to continue teaching. Do you hear yourself?\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything so I followed up with \u201cmom I love you, but really?\u201d The conversation came to an end and we hung up. Now she\u2019s talking even worse about teachers (it\u2019s the only thing she will talk about) and saying court reporters are treated just as badly. I never said they were treated good, only that a raise is so amazing for teachers and not to compare professions that have nothing to do with each other. \n\nI feel like an ahole because she wasn\u2019t the only reason I left teaching and that was harsh of me to put on her. However, she will not stop trying to prove her point by saying she has it so much worse off than teachers and she deserves a raise more. \n\nI\u2019m visiting both her and my dad this weekend. I don\u2019t know if I should just let her talk, or if I would be even more of an ahole for standing up for teachers, even though I\u2019m not one anymore. \n\nAITA for how I said it? Does anyone have advice on how I could word things better so maybe she\u2019ll understand? \n\nAlso I just want to say, I will always fight for teachers, especially to people who have power to make a change (my mom is not one of those people so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth my energy). Teachers are the most amazing people ever, especially with how things are going.

As others have said, explain to her that you need to agree to disagree and no longer discuss it. If she persists then politely end the conversation.
