If so, as a host he is even more obligated to shut down someone who is disrupting the event.  \n\nWho are these people offering you (unsolicited?) advise on how to handle your family situations?  Are they close relatives?  Perhaps they are close to the SIL (witch)?   I would ask them why they would think it\u2019s appropriate to give you advise in this situation and then perhaps you could then offer them specific advise about their families.  \n\nAlso who keeps going on a speech that people are telling them to stop?

I would definitely check in with the SIL if you haven\u2019t already to make sure she understands the effect her speech was having on the audience.
