It was all fine until my SIL (Mike's sister) started her speech. She started talking about Mike and the speech mentioned almost nothing about Sara. The one thing mentioned about Sara is that how she is proud Sara didn't replace Mike with Jake. She then brought up the topic of Mike's death, or more accurately how he died. \n\nSara always had nightmares and panic attacks about it. So we avoid that specific topic of him. And when my SIL started going in detail about it both she and my MIL(Mike's mom) started having panic attacks. Jake and his siblings started telling SIL to stop (Me, my siblings and Mike's brothers were to busy with Sara and MIL). She wouldn't stop.
