So during the family after ceremony party (I'm not sure what it is called abroad), a few of our family members (my dad, Mike's mom and one of his brothers, and my son) said a few speeches about her. It was all fine until my SIL (Mike's sister) started her speech. She started talking about Mike and the speech mentioned almost nothing about Sara. The one thing mentioned about Sara is that how she is proud Sara didn't replace Mike with Jake. She then brought up the topic of Mike's death, or more accurately how he died. \n\nSara always had nightmares and panic attacks about it. So we avoid that specific topic of him. And when my SIL started going in detail about it both she and my MIL(Mike's mom) started having panic attacks. Jake and his siblings started telling SIL to stop (Me, my siblings and Mike's brothers were to busy with Sara and MIL). She wouldn't stop. Long story short they finally had to kick her out of the wedding.\n\nBut all of yesterday I have had people calling me to ask me to apologize to SIL, because according to them while SIL was wrong it wasn't my husband's place to kick her out.\n\nSo AITA? because I'm still in shock after what happened I dont think I'm thinking clearly", "created_utc": 1677991662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11inupo/aita_supporting_my_second_husband_when_he_kicked/", "score": 450, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A speech about a  tragic death does not have a place at a wedding, a time of celebration.", "Absolutely NTA. Good for you for sticking up for your child and protecting her mental health on her wedding day.", "NTA. That's messed up. SIL owes everyone an apology.", "NTA.\n\nHe may not have replaced Mike, but at that ceremony Jake was there as your husband and as Sara's stepfather, and he intervened on behalf of you and your daughter.   He saw a fire that needed to be put out, and he did so.   The only person who owes anyone an apology is your SIL who clearly was being too self-absorbed to read the room.", "NTA. Your SIL is, however, TAH. She sounds unhinged. She intruded on what should have been a lovely event, and brought her own psychodrama and need for attention to it. She sounds like someone who does not deserve to be part of your or your daughter\u2019s lives. She should apologize, not you, but she sounds too self-centred and unhinged to ever consider such a thing.", "Oh my gosh, I am so sorry for the mess you had to deal with!

The only one who should apologise to everyone is your SIL.  And Jake is a good stepfather and step-SIL to Mikes mum for his actions.\n\nINFO Not that it makes a difference to my judgement but how old was Sara when you met Jake?  What sort of relationship does Jake have with Sara.  And to get further dynamics of their relationship, who walked Sara down the aisle?", "NTA - your SIL should've stopped when she was asked to.

The only choice was to remove her.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL intentionally triggered multiple family members despite being asked to stop. She saw fit to turn the wedding into a memorial which was an unkind thing to do. It doesn't matter if the wedding coordinator or the janitor had kicked her out - she needed to be removed.\n\nIf this is part of a pattern, it's even worse/more concerning.", "NTA\n\nSIL's speech was grossly inappropriate and continuing on with it despite being asked to stop after it was causing considerable distress to both Sara and her mother is several notches beyond AH behavior.  Though SIL apparently still has serious issues coming to terms with Mike's death, she should have gotten therapy to cope with them, instead of deciding that his daughter's wedding was the place to vent at the cost of reopening some old and painful wounds, ruining what should have been Sara's happiest day.\n\nWith SIL being that far out of line, it doesn't really matter who threw her out as long as it got her to stop making an even bigger mess of things, and as far as apologies owed, it's her that owes the rest of the family one, not you or your husband.", "NTA, though maybe she's still just grief stricken and can't act right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
