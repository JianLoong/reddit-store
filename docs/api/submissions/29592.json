My fianc\u00e9\u2019s step father married his mom when he was 3 and raised him like his own. His mom died from breast cancer when he was a teenager but his step dad let him stay at home until he was 26 and even trained him to be a mechanic like himself. I have a lot of respect for his stepdad raising a child that\u2019s not his own and helping us both when we needed it. He co-signed for our first place because neither of us had regular jobs and income and when we bought a place he and my fianc\u00e9 did all the renos. He is a great guy and lives with rescue 4 dogs. I\u2019m Chinese American so the idea of a step dad(it\u2019s not really in the culture) being as close as a bio dad is unfathomable but I can see that they are close as if they were blood related \n\nMy own bio father is a deadbeat to me. He dated my mom when they were both young and then left when I was born. He didn\u2019t give us money and my mom never asked which is crazy if you ask me. I found out after I as an adult that he never wanted me but she did and felt guilty because he wanted her to get rid of me. So it\u2019s not like he wanted me to exist. He visited me a few times in my childhood but never let us see his other family so I have half singling I only met when I was older. My mom and I were pretty poor growing up, we had government aid and when I got older I realized my half siblings were raised in a middle class home and my mom and I suffered for very little reason. So I have no reason to want my bio father to walk me down the aisle. When my bio father found out about the wedding he offered and I pretty rudely declined. I was mad at my mom for telling him but she think I should forgive and let him walk me down the aisle because no matter how much fianc\u00e9\u2019s stepdad helped he isn\u2019t family.

Rightfully would be the \"father figure\", but absent that would be the next best thing.\n\nNTA\n\nTrust me, if my absentee father tried to get me to let him walk down the isle, if he was lucky to ne invited at all, id react the same way.\n\nEdit: missing words", "NTA.

The moment is about love and what better way to display it with him walking you down the aisle.\n\nIgnore your mom. She grew up in a culture that ingrained into her mind that she is a doormat and unfortunately doesn't understand that it's not a good way to live. You can tell her that you refuse to eat bitter and want a better life than what your deadbeat father gave the two of you.", "NTA\n\nDon't invite your biodad to the wedding. Your wedding, your rules. You should feel safe, comfortable, and loved by everyone in attendance. If that's not true of someone, don't let them come.", "NTA\n\nLet's be real: this is a tradition that originated back when marriages were seen as a transfer of property between the bride's father and the groom.  Back then, your dad's actions wouldn't have mattered because his \"right\" to walk you down the aisle as your biological father would have remained in tact.  There are examples of Victorian weddings where the father is invited essentially JUST to walk to bride down the aisle and then immediately escorted out of the church for this reason!\n\nBut that doesn't matter any longer.  You are no one's property, and therefore NO ONE can claim the \"right\" to walk you down the aisle.  That is an honor that you can bestow to anyone or no one, and it's fully up to you how you make your decision and who you choose.  It does not have to be your biological father.  It can be your step-father, someone else's step-father, your dog, your grandpa, your mom, or even your invisible friend from childhood.  It is YOUR decision.  Pick whomever you would like!", "NTA. You don't mention if that's the case, but I got the feeling that your mother's cultural habits might have something to do with her perception of what should be done in this situation, and that she feels a wedding is a reflection of how much you are following social codes. Maybe I'm wrong, but to you it's more of a sentimental thing, and that's where the divide would be coming from. Depending on whether you two are able to discuss these things, it could be worth establishing, if only because other (smaller) conflicts could be covered by that same misunderstanding.\n\nBut in any case, it's your wedding, and you clearly have a lot of affection for that man ; he's the one who's going to be part of your life moving forward, the same way he has been for the past few years.

Stick to your guns :)", "As you said, \u201cas close as if they were blood related\u201d  your bio-dad may be blood related but has never shown you love.  He has no right to even hope to be a part of your life.

Your father in law probably knows more about you than your sperm donor dad does. Your mom should take that in consideration, especially since your father in law IS becoming family.

I'm Indian American and definitely know the pressure to go with what your parents say. And the importance of family over everything. But it sounds like your mom made her own life (and yours) more miserable than it needed to be by refusing to stand up for herself. Don't get me wrong, I empathize with it, but it still hurt both of you. And it sounds like you don't want that for yourself. It might feel rude or mean to push back on this, but at some point you're going to need to set boundaries with her if you want your life to go differently, and so you might as well start by honoring the man who actually stepped up to be a parent. \n\nAs a side note, if you are really feeling that pressured to agree to her, maybe you can instead have her walk you down the aisle? To be clear, I absolutely think you should go with your original plan. But just an alternative option for if you're finding yourself unable/unwilling to keep fighting the point", "NTA, the person you choose to walk you down the aisle should be someone you want/love/respect.

This is your day, a special day to remember as perfect and wonderful.  You put your deadbeat dad on your arm and give him any kind of honor - you will have nothing but resentment in your heart when you walk down that aisle.  And there is no place for those kind of emotions on your wedding day.", "nta, he left. theres consequences. sure you can forgive him and i encourage it because it will eat you alive if not. but that doesnt entitle him to anything. should you have been nicer about declining? probably but I dont think that affects whether or not yta", "NTA \u2014 just because your mother accepted his neglect of you doesn\u2019t mean you should.", "NTA.
