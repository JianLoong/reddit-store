It sounds like she was itching for a fight. By not giving her one, it forced her to calm down and process her feelings. I can be hotheaded, but what she said in front of your child was really tough.", "NTA. She sounds emotionally manipulative with both you and your kids. Best to not engage when she's agitated like that. It sounds like you guys might want/need to talk to somebody about things and see if they can be fixed because this is not sustainable.", "NTA. Maybe your wife was overwhelmed with feelings, but if she wanted your attention, she should have talked to you like an adult instead of screaming and scaring the 3 year old. Also you deserve more than the bare minimum on your birthday. You should not have to be used to not getting anything from your wife. At the very least, she could give you a peaceful household on your birthday.\n\nI hope she gets some help for her anger or depression.", "NTA at all, and I\u2019m sorry she acted so shitty on your birthday. Is this a common occurrence where she has outbursts like this and then picks fights with you? And was your toddler crying because of her yelling at him or something? Because that would be really shitty too (I have a son and understand the frustration of cranky toddlers, but I never went off on my son in a way that made him cry that hard). I have bipolar 2 and have mood cycles that involve irrational rage (which can be *intense*) so I\u2019m wondering if she has something mental health or personality disorder related. Whatever it is, you have no reason to feel shitty but she does. No matter what\u2019s going on she had no excuse to ignore your birthday like that and then go off on you, especially when you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. The fact you have no energy to deal with her says a lot about the state of your relationship. Frankly, you sound very unhappy. Maybe it\u2019s time to examine that.\n\nHappy belated birthday.

I think everyone deserves to have good birthdays no matter their age.", "NTA - You did the right thing giving the **both** of you space. \n\nHappy belated birthday!", "NTA:  So basically she throw thr kid at you because it was too much work for her and upset when you were done you didn't comfort her.

Sorry your birthday was treated like a normal day though.", "Brother, this is so far beyond Reddit's paygrade...\n\nYou and your wife are very clearly having a of problems that are going to require professional help. A short list:\n\n- No one got you anything for your birthday. It's clearly not the first time and clearly disappoints you. So you either have a massive failure of communication where they do not realize this, or a massive red flag within the relationship where they know but do not care.\n\n- Your wife is very clearly at her wits end with parenting, either reasonably because she's overwhelmed, your kids are objectively more of a handful than the norm, and you play too many video games [or some combo thereof], or unreasonably because you DO help and your wife is nonetheless overwhelmed with basic parenting duties or struggling with other things.\n\n- Your wife has clearly indicated that her \"emotional outbursts\" are absolutely to get your attention and she feels ignored because you...ignored her. We have no way of knowing whether you disengaging was reasonable or justified or part of larger issues.\n\nYou want to know who CAN help you sus out all of these very complex issues? A professional family therapist or couples' counselor.\n\nSince I have to give a verdict, YTA for thinking \"yeah, you want to know how I'll address these very concerning realities of my life?

I am no doctor but she is on the brink of insanity.", "NTA your wife needs severe therapy and mental help.", "There seems to be a lot of missing information here. Your wife being at her absolute last nerve really shouldn't be a complete surprise unless you haven't been paying attention.

More fun anyway.", "ESH", "ESH. Your wife is struggling. She keeps telling you she\u2019s struggling. You leave her with a screaming 3yo while she\u2019s struggling.

That\u2019s a valid complaint. When it comes to the rest of it though, you are ignoring your wife crying out very literally for help and hiding in your video games. That seems like a habit for you. It\u2019s toxic to your marriage and needs to stop. You need to do more to take the pressure off your wife with the kids, she\u2019s clearly out of emotional bandwidth. The \u201chad to spend a little more time with the little guy\u201d comment gives away the imbalance in parenting duties. That\u2019s just parenting your own kid, it\u2019s not an extra chore you did to be nice. Please look into couples counseling if you can. I know it can take forever but your wife obviously isn\u2019t coping well and you\u2019re not willing to communicate. The two of you both need help!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You both need to figure out your shit so it isn't being taken out on a three year old. If your wife needs more help with the kids, start helping more.
