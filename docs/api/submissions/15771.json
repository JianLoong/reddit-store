It sounds like she was itching for a fight. By not giving her one, it forced her to calm down and process her feelings. I can be hotheaded, but what she said in front of your child was really tough.", "NTA. She sounds emotionally manipulative with both you and your kids. Best to not engage when she's agitated like that. It sounds like you guys might want/need to talk to somebody about things and see if they can be fixed because this is not sustainable.", "NTA. Maybe your wife was overwhelmed with feelings, but if she wanted your attention, she should have talked to you like an adult instead of screaming and scaring the 3 year old. Also you deserve more than the bare minimum on your birthday. You should not have to be used to not getting anything from your wife. At the very least, she could give you a peaceful household on your birthday.\n\nI hope she gets some help for her anger or depression.", "NTA at all, and I\u2019m sorry she acted so shitty on your birthday. Is this a common occurrence where she has outbursts like this and then picks fights with you? And was your toddler crying because of her yelling at him or something? Because that would be really shitty too (I have a son and understand the frustration of cranky toddlers, but I never went off on my son in a way that made him cry that hard). I have bipolar 2 and have mood cycles that involve irrational rage (which can be *intense*) so I\u2019m wondering if she has something mental health or personality disorder related. Whatever it is, you have no reason to feel shitty but she does. No matter what\u2019s going on she had no excuse to ignore your birthday like that and then go off on you, especially when you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. The fact you have no energy to deal with her says a lot about the state of your relationship. Frankly, you sound very unhappy. Maybe it\u2019s time to examine that.\n\nHappy belated birthday. I wish it had been better. I think everyone deserves to have good birthdays no matter their age.", "NTA - You did the right thing giving the **both** of you space. \n\nHappy belated birthday!", "NTA:  So basically she throw thr kid at you because it was too much work for her and upset when you were done you didn't comfort her. Dude even if this was a regular day and not your birthday you wouldn't be an asshole", "NTA engaging would have just made things worse. Good on you for getting the little guy to bed and looking after his needs.", "INFO, what did the 3 old son do? Sometimes parents can\u2019t take it anymore so they are having an outburst.", "Happy Birthday! -- NTA - She literally screamed, get your kid. Then she blasts you...its' all about her on your birthday. This-is-sad. \n\nDo something kind for yourself.", "NTA. Sounds like you handled this fairly well. I too do not like to engage with people having an emotional outburst. Let them tantrum and calm down. \n\nMaybe you can talk to your wife when she\u2019s not upset about what\u2019s going on with her and what she needs.", "NTA. Sorry your birthday was treated like a normal day though.", "Brother, this is so far beyond Reddit's paygrade...\n\nYou and your wife are very clearly having a of problems that are going to require professional help. A short list:\n\n- No one got you anything for your birthday. It's clearly not the first time and clearly disappoints you. So you either have a massive failure of communication where they do not realize this, or a massive red flag within the relationship where they know but do not care.\n\n- Your wife is very clearly at her wits end with parenting, either reasonably because she's overwhelmed, your kids are objectively more of a handful than the norm, and you play too many video games [or some combo thereof], or unreasonably because you DO help and your wife is nonetheless overwhelmed with basic parenting duties or struggling with other things.\n\n- Your wife has clearly indicated that her \"emotional outbursts\" are absolutely to get your attention and she feels ignored because you...ignored her. We have no way of knowing whether you disengaging was reasonable or justified or part of larger issues.\n\nYou want to know who CAN help you sus out all of these very complex issues? A professional family therapist or couples' counselor.\n\nSince I have to give a verdict, YTA for thinking \"yeah, you want to know how I'll address these very concerning realities of my life? Internet strangers.\"", "There\u2019s not really enough info here on who works who does what around the house who does how much childcare. It being your birthday is kind of irrelevant really, if your wife is having emotional outbursts there must be a reason for that.", "I feel like there\u2019s a lot going on in your relationship that isn\u2019t posted here. But on the surface, NTA. Even with issues, I still try to make my wife\u2019s birthday her day. You guys clearly seem to have some communication issues to work through though. Good luck, I hope it gets better.", "NTA She must be going trough depression.\n Does she celebrates anything or just not your birthdays? \nYou need communication, there\u2019s none of that apparently, you two need to talk.\nHBD!!", "NTA, it sounds like she\u2019s using emotional outbursts to get attention, which is pretty toxic behaviour.", "[deleted]", "I think it's best to get a therapist for her. I am no doctor but she is on the brink of insanity.", "NTA your wife needs severe therapy and mental help.", "There seems to be a lot of missing information here. Your wife being at her absolute last nerve really shouldn't be a complete surprise unless you haven't been paying attention. I'm going against the grain and saying ESH. \n\nWife needs to use her words and I'm having a hard time believing that 20 mins with your other kid was the only/real problem.", "Happy birthday.\n\nYour wife seem to be on her last nerve, maybe exhausted ( how many kids you have and what ages, what wife do? did she had postpartum depression? did she recover from it already ? )\n\nseems like she really needs help or she might crash. \n\nAs for gifts - we stopped doing \"gifts\" after a while, hard to come up with more stuff since everything is being bought as needed and started doing \"experience for us\" - show, special dinner, some craft or cooking class. More fun anyway.", "ESH", "ESH. Your wife is struggling. She keeps telling you she\u2019s struggling. You leave her with a screaming 3yo while she\u2019s struggling. It\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t hear them screaming before you got up there. \u201cAnd a bunch of other stuff I don\u2019t agree with\u201d is intentionally vague. \n\nShe is an AH for the way she talks to your kid, at *minimum*. \n\nI think she\u2019d tell a different version of this story.", "ESH\n\nI\u2019m sorry your wife didn\u2019t do more for your birthday. That\u2019s a valid complaint. When it comes to the rest of it though, you are ignoring your wife crying out very literally for help and hiding in your video games. That seems like a habit for you. It\u2019s toxic to your marriage and needs to stop. You need to do more to take the pressure off your wife with the kids, she\u2019s clearly out of emotional bandwidth. The \u201chad to spend a little more time with the little guy\u201d comment gives away the imbalance in parenting duties. That\u2019s just parenting your own kid, it\u2019s not an extra chore you did to be nice. Please look into couples counseling if you can. I know it can take forever but your wife obviously isn\u2019t coping well and you\u2019re not willing to communicate. The two of you both need help!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
