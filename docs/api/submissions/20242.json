My mom pulled over and was like \"hey do you want a ride to the bus stop?\" And didn't understand why the kid was very weirded out by this.\n\nI was like \"lol mom of course he was freaked out, you're a stranger trying to get him in your car\"\n\n And she was like \"but we're neighbors? Yes of course stranger danger and all but when I was growing up you could go with neighbors like that, even if you didn't know them well.\"\n\n And I was just like \"yeah times have changed ma, if you don't know that person extremely well, you don't get in a car with them. Thats how we're all raised up now\"\n\n\nSo maybe it was just something like that, old guy didn't realize that's not ok in the modern world. I think you did fine by stopping it, and hey. He accepted your request. Grumbled a little sure, but whatever. Its in the past now.", "NTA. This is wildly inappropriate.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so odd of the other guy though. I might be tempted to take a picture of an adorable child, but wouldn\u2019t because I understand that no one else can possibly know what my motives are. When I was a child, being patted on the head by total strangers wasn\u2019t that odd. Times have changed, maybe he\u2019s still catching up? \nIn any case, there was certainly no cause for him to get butthurt about it.", "NTA, you did the right thing. Who the eff knows what goes on anymore, better safe than sorry.", "NTA\n\nTaking photos of other people's kids is, as you put it, weird.\n\nThat's not to say the guy is definitely a creep, just that he's probably a completely unaware idiot.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA....and that dude is creepy if he thinks it's ok to take a random picture of a child he has no relations to and is a stranger to you.   \nI don't know why he would think that was ok", "Eh it was a weird call on the guy's part, I would never just photograph someone's kid without even asking the parents or something. His intentions were likely innocent but he was acting slightly out of line, NTA.", "NTA.  That man is creepy AF. He's just complaining to his family to normalize his blatantly aberrant behavior in their minds.", "NTA with caveats. When you and your family are in public, you don't have any expectation of privacy. Anyone can take your photo if they want, that goes for your kids too. You may not like it, but that is the way it is. You can ASK him to stop, but that is as far as you can go. You can't demand he stop, or delete any photos he took. \n\nPeople these days are so paranoid over things like this.  We get photographed and videoed a hundred times a day any time we venture out of the house.", "NTA - you were protecting your child. Good for you!", "NTA - you protected your child and that\u2019s the right thing to do. \nProtect your children before caring about a stranger. You never know what that person was going to do with that photo.", "Was it important to mention the man's race?", "NTA\n\nTaking pictures of other peoples kids without permission is creepy.", "NTA, he's being shady.

Our two young daughters were taking pictures at one of the photo backdrops when this one older Caucasian man (late 50\u2019s/60\u2019s) stopped walking with his family/group and proceeded to pull out his phone to try and take a picture of my 2 yro daughter as she was posing. I stepped in front of his phone and turned back to ask if he was seriously going to take a picture of my daughter to which he replied \u201cwell I was gonna cause she\u2019s adorable but I can tell you don\u2019t want me to\u201d. I replied frustrated I absolutely don\u2019t want him to, so he walked off complaining to his wife/family about me being mean to him for not letting him take a picture of my very young daughter. Made my wife and I feel uncomfortable, the rest of our party at dinner agreed that was weird. Curious though is that somehow acceptable behavior of that man or AITA?
