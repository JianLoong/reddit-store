You're niece has chosen a very black and white view of the breakdown of your sons marriage, most  likely influenced by the ex-wife/best friend.  But the truth of the matter is, your son is obviously not leaving her simply because she gained weight.  There is a much bigger issue going on with the ex-wife that she refuses to get help for, and her weight gain is a side effect, who knows maybe she has long suffered from undiagnosed Postpartum Depression.

There are a lot of otherwise normal, rational adults, people I think most would consider to be perfectly sane, but who have very toxic views on family. Who might try to justify or downplay bad behavior and convince themselves it's not *really* abusive, or who just believe you always support family no matter what.

I think many of you should add your true intentions to your vows. You know the clause. Let your future spouse know how much weight they can gain. How long you'll deal with their sickness. \n\nSad thing, we don't even know the other side of the story. You know and humans are notoriously honest when it comes to admitting if they've had any error/hand in the disruption of the marriage. What if her behavior started after a major marital betrayal from the husband? And there are things he refused to clean up so her response is self harm?

Marriage, by default, indicates 2 people are willing to bond their lives together and support each other and be a team, for life. If one person stops being a partner or part of the team, the bond is broken. DIL stopped being a part of the marriage 2 years ago. She won't take care of herself, she's not taking care of the children, she's not providing support... and she could. She's not terminally ill. Right now, at least. She just stopped.

I hope things are better.", "Maybe I'm really stupid, but how can wife have PPD if the kids are 7 and 5? That's just.... depression at this point right?
