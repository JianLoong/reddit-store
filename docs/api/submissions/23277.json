The important ones in this story are my son, 25 , and my oldest niece, 25. \n\nSo anyway , my son got married at 19 while he was in the Army, to a girl he dated in highschool. He did 4 years and is out now, still a reservist though Moved close by, about a block away , so real close. His wife and him have 2 kids, 7 and 5. \n\nHis wife is..... Well, heavy. Like 300+ heavy. At about my height of 5'4. And also doesn't clean herself  very well. This just happened 2 years ago. My son has tried to get her help, she won't go to doctors or therapy, so he has had enough and left her , bringing the kids since she has trouble keeping up with them. So he's here. Issue is, my niece is her best friend since grade school and is saying nasty stuff about my son, he shouldn't leave his wife and take her kids because she is overweight and he's a jerk. I said he can stay here and she needs to stay out of it. My son got sick of having to do most of the work around the house because she isn't mobile, and doesn't take care of herself or kids . So now waiting for court about the kids. Husband agrees but wants my niece and I to stop arguing.

I think that's a completely valid reason to leave a marriage. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nHe left her because he was unhappy - for whatever reason - otherwise he would have stayed. That's how it goes. \n\nThere's nothing wrong as a parent supporting your child choices. \n\nIt's his choice, and this is your support. \n\n Would have been shittier to be on the other side and simply put peer pressure on him to be in a situation he doesn't want to be.", "A marriage is a partnership, and when that partnership breaks down and both parties are unwilling to put the work in to salvage it, than it deteriorates to divorce (obviously).  You're niece has chosen a very black and white view of the breakdown of your sons marriage, most  likely influenced by the ex-wife/best friend.  But the truth of the matter is, your son is obviously not leaving her simply because she gained weight.  There is a much bigger issue going on with the ex-wife that she refuses to get help for, and her weight gain is a side effect, who knows maybe she has long suffered from undiagnosed Postpartum Depression.  Your son can't navigate the marriage on his own, and for the kids he has chosen to do what he believes is best for them.  NTA", "NTA: \n\nit\u2019s more than reasonable to leave a partner who won\u2019t take care of themselves despite being morbidly obese. Is it painful? Yes. Does it hurt everyone involved? Yes.\n\nDoes your son deserve to spend the rest of his days being a caretaker because someone with physical and mental issues refuses help?\n\nNo.\n\nYou\u2019re being a good parent by supporting your child with his reasonable decision to not spend his life taking care of a whale who won\u2019t seek help. NTA", "If \"taking his side\" means supporting him and his kids when they're in need, then NTA. Besides that though, maybe stay out of it. It sounds like there are more than enough people involved already. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nYour son isn\u2019t leaving her because of her weight. He\u2019s leaving because she refuses to take care of herself and it has reached a point where she\u2019s unable to be an equal partner and contributor to the household if she\u2019s not mobile. \n\nThat\u2019s not a superficial reason when she refuses to seek help for her issues. It would be superficial if she was being treated and he decided he just didn\u2019t want a sick or fat wife.", "NTA. Those don't sound like superficial reasons to me. I assume it's mostly because of her mental health, not her weight. \n\nBut also, you're a 46 year old woman, don't engage in a 25 year old's drama.", "NTA your son should not stay in what sounds like a unhappy marriage.\n\nIf his wife is unable for any reason to care for the kid primarily then they should be with the parent that can.\n\nAs for your niece you need to tell her to stay out of their marriage issues. You will not turn your son and grandkids away.\n\nIf your son has offered her help and she refuses their isn\u2019t much more he can do to help her. No mater how much you love someone you can\u2019t let them drag you down with them.", "NTA. 300+ is not a few extra pounds or a little overweight. That is morbidly obese. That is a serious health issue for which she is refusing to seek help. She isn\u2019t mobile and can\u2019t/won\u2019t take care of her kids? I\u2019m sorry, no one should have to put up with that. It\u2019s like an alcoholic who refuses to get help. Your son deserves better and so do his kids. I hope for all their sakes she realizes how serious this is. It\u2019s not shallow at all.", "NTA - support your soon and give them a place to stay, but keep you opinions to yourself. \n\nPeople don\u2019t get that size because they want to, it is a result of years of negative behaviour stemming from untreated mental health issues. Your son has reached his limit and wants a better life for his kids. It\u2019s understandable that he wants to get away and protect them.", "NTA.  Stop talking to her about it. \n\nSon isn't an asshole either.  It is a reasonable expectation that your spouse takes care of themselves.  She refuses to do anything after 2 years.  At this point it's on her.", "NTA - you're supporting your son, who is looking out for the best interests of his kids and getting them out of a destructive situation.", "NTA for taking your son in or taking his side.

It doesn't matter if she lives close, tell her she is not allowed  in your home until she keeps her opinions to herself. \n\nYour soon to be ex-dil has been offered help and refuses to help herself.  Your son has spent a long time struggling to accept that his wife will not but in the hard work to be the mother needs to be. It doesn't sound like your son wanted her to do anything but to TRY to get healthy for her children. She gave up on herself and now your son has to deal with HER choice. If her children and marriage are not reason enough to try then he really doesn't have much of a choice, stay and let his children suffer or walk away.  The children will suffer by not having Mom around to play with, having to go to her chair of bed because it is too much for her to come to them. They will have to modify so much of their lives because of their mother's weight.", "NTA. You can't help somebody who doesn't wants to be helped. She apparently doesn't want to be helped, whatever the reason, even if this means she can't take care of herself or the kids. That's a very tragic but a very good reason to take yourself and your kids out of that situation.", "NTA. He\u2019s your son.

However: I don\u2019t see it as taking sides for giving him and the kids a safe place to go.\n\nHis reasons for wanting to leave do not need to be validated to anyone BUT his soon-to-be ex-wife. Everything that happens is between them.
