You're niece has chosen a very black and white view of the breakdown of your sons marriage, most  likely influenced by the ex-wife/best friend.  But the truth of the matter is, your son is obviously not leaving her simply because she gained weight.  There is a much bigger issue going on with the ex-wife that she refuses to get help for, and her weight gain is a side effect, who knows maybe she has long suffered from undiagnosed Postpartum Depression.

Don't argue, just hang up.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nDo what\u2019s best for your grandkids and son!\n\nMaybe your niece should try to convince her to get both kinds of therapy and to work hard for her babies. She is worth saving, she just doesn\u2019t see it. Maybe after losing her family, she\u2019ll get to work so she can at least have shared custody down the road. That\u2019s a good goal to work towards! I understand your son is fed-up with trying and that\u2019s ok.", "NTA", "NTA. He didn\u2019t leave because she\u2019s overweight. He left because she\u2019s unclean. She doesn\u2019t wash herself, doesn\u2019t take care of herself. She\u2019s not mobile, whether that means completely bedridden or something else.

You're never the asshole for taking your son's side, not unless he's literally killing people or something equally heinous. Even then it would still be pretty understandable.", "NTA. The reasons for him leaving are not superficial. She was not being a good partner or parent.", "Here's a solution (NTA By the way)\n\nNiece moves in with her bestie. \n\nThere. Problem solved. She's there to take care of bestie and is out of the way and you don't have to throw her out of the house for disrespecting your son.\n\nEither way, you need to have a talk with her. YOUR HOUSE. YOUR RULES. If she can't shut up about stuff that's none of her buisness she's got 30 days to find somewhere else to live.", "NTA. He didn't leave her because she was \"overweight\".\n\nHe left her because she has completely given up on everything. And would rather stay bedridden than be a mother to her children, a wife to her husband, or even take care of yourself.\n\nIt's hard enough to take care of 2 kids by yourself. It's a nightmare to take care of 2 little kids, and an adult that is incapable of taking care of themselves. And since they are married not only is he forced into being a care taker for 3 people, he cannot have a real social life or relationship because his wife refuses to get help or change her situation.", "NTA. It\u2019s entirely appropriate to leave someone for completely letting themselves go. It\u2019s not superficial to expect to be attracted to your wife and expect her to work in that as well as you do.", "NTA\n\nAnd refusing to stay married to somebody who is 300 lbs, can't share housekeeping or parenting duties because of their weight, and refuses to seek help - that's not superficial.

Your son tried to get his wife to get healthier but she refuses so he is doing this to protect himself and his kids.", "NTA. Your son didn't divorce his wife because she got fat - he divorced her because she stopped putting in effort. She was content to eat, sleep, stew in her own filth, and let your son do all the work of maintaining the household and raising the children, on top of being the sole provider. That's not what your son signed up for.", "NTA but do not say or imply anything negative about the mom if the kids are home. It would hurt your grandkids.

They married while still teenagers so it\u2019s no surprise things have changed over the years. Your niece can say whatever she wants but it\u2019s frankly not her business. Nobody outside of a relationship truly knows what it\u2019s like to be in it. She can support her friend while also minding her own business. She should try to do that.\n\nETA: wife can shut this entire line of conversation down every time by telling niece one time and one time only, \u201cI won\u2019t be discussing son\u2019s marriage or divorce with you.

Your son should tell his cousin that he\u2019ll consider returning to the home if she can convince his wife to see a mental health professional.

If she refuses to get help, that's on her.", "NTA, shes obese, doesnt take care of herself and refuses to get help for her very legit issues. Hes not leaving bc of her appearance.", "NTA", "NTA- I think we can all agree there\u2019s a difference between leaving your partner for putting on weight because they\u2019re not a teen anymore and their weight become a real and prevalent issue in their health and ability to care for the kids.", "NTA.

She ignored them.\n\nIf she cant look after herself, the home or even her kids due to her weight and she still thinks its not an issue then he has every right to have enough and go.\n\nI would be real careful with family court though.

YOU are taking care of them.", "Overweight is a euphemism, 300+ lbs at 5\u20194 is morbid obesity\n\nEven if he did leave because of her weight I\u2019d say NTA", "This! It has nothing to do with her being overweight in general \u2014 Op could have even left that part out. It\u2019s because she isn\u2019t taking care of herself, the kids, or anything around the house.", "I agree, and OP is NTA, and niece needs to stay the hell out of it. It's not her business, and she didn't have to live his life. His wife obviously has something major going on with her, but if she refuses to do anything about it, there's really not much else OP's son can do. You can't make an adult do or not do anything, it has to be up to them. Maybe this will be the wake-up call his wife needs, who knows.", "Yup, he has done what he can and had to think of the kids\u2026 plus he deserves to be happy. Honestly, it\u2019s okay to want to be attracted to your partner, but that\u2019s not the main issue like you said.", "Can\u2019t help someone who won\u2019t help themselves.

While the situation is unfortunate, if he's tried to get her help and she's refused, he has to think of his kids first. It's the same situation he would be in if her addiction was to drugs, gambling, shopping, or alcohol and she refused help. She has to be the one to decide to get better.

He should stay with her regardless if she can bathe or do housework or anything else!

And it sounds like he has tried to get her help, but she declines. Regardless if it's mental or physical health issues, or a combination of both, the son is unhappy and does not feel he has an equal partner anymore. Additionally, there's no end in sight since DIL refuses help and is immobile, per OP. So her son is a caregiver to her and their 2 children.

OP said she raised her niece as well, so her son and niece are more like siblings than cousins. So essentially OP will be cutting off her daughter while she supports her son. \n\nRegardless, NTA, OP. I understand your niece is your DIL\u2019s bestie and she wants to support her, but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to criticize you or your son in this situation, especially when she\u2019s blind to DIL\u2019s faults. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to make it *seem* like a superficial issue (and as though your son is the bad guy), but that doesn\u2019t make it one.

So just throwing my unasked opinion out there on the internet haha.

Mental health is complicated, but if everyone who loves you tells you that you need help and you refuse then that is on you. DIL ditched the marriage, not by getting fat but by abandoning all hope and leaving her husband to clean up the mess instead of doing the work so she could be a partner again.
