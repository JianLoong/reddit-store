You're niece has chosen a very black and white view of the breakdown of your sons marriage, most  likely influenced by the ex-wife/best friend.  But the truth of the matter is, your son is obviously not leaving her simply because she gained weight.  There is a much bigger issue going on with the ex-wife that she refuses to get help for, and her weight gain is a side effect, who knows maybe she has long suffered from undiagnosed Postpartum Depression.

No wonder he was miserable.", "It doesn't even sound like he's being superficial.  It sounds like your daughter-in-law has made lifestyle choices that make her a bad wife and a bad mother and refuses to change them, so he left.  That's not superficial.  Besides, he's your son.  Unless he did something truly repugnant (which this isn't) you should be taking his side regardless.  NTA.", "INFO: he had kid(s) when he was still in the army and probably away from the family. Who took care back then? If it was the mother, what has changed since?", "NTA, that level of weight is super unhealthy. She probably can't do physical things like keeping up with the kids. That's a big deal.", "NTA \nYour title is very misleading\nOne of my cousins broke off an engagement because his fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t accept to do a breast enhancement surgery : now that\u2019s superficial, and shallow, and controlling and dangerous \nAnd my cousin is a jerky jerk face \nYour son is perfectly right to leave a marriage where he is not happy and obviously the kids are not safe (in the sense where they don\u2019t have healthy eating and moving habits)\nYou\u2019re more than fine", "Sounds like an unhealthy way to live. Leaving her and establishing himself as a happy, functioning adult is the best thing he can do.", "NTA", "It sounds like the son made a genuine attempt to get his wife help. But she wouldn\u2019t do anything.\n\nTake weight out of the equation and look at how the wife takes care of her side of things. Does she help with the kids or neglect them? Does she contribute to the chores/workload or does OP do everything? \n\nWhen you take weight out the scenario and see that OP\u2019s son left because he and their children were being neglected by his wife despite his best attempts to get things fixed. He didn\u2019t abandon his kids. He brought them with him to ensure that they get taken care of.", "So why doesn't neice need to stay out of it?", "As someone that's addicted to food this is more than just that. He's not leaving her just because she's overweight. He's leaving her because she has chosen not to be mobile and help out. I'm only 5' 2\" and I weigh 280 but I still clean my house and myself. This sounds like depression and/or a different undiagnosed health issues", "NTA. You can lead a horse to water.... Your son has tried to get her help, but she refuses. He didn't call it quits after she gained a few pounds without offering help or support.\n\nHaving kids grow up in a house with a mom in that state is not good for the kids. He needs to put them first and he is. It would be a different story if she was trying her hardest to get back on track.", "The woman cant even move shes so big I think the issues likely being unable to fit into a shower rather than depression", "I disagree. I'm only 5' 2\" and I weigh 280 and I wasn't active before I gained all my weight. Mine is all fat but even with that I still clean my house and myself. This sounds like depression and/or a different undiagnosed health issues", "It's just different for everyone. I was my heaviest at around 250 at 5'4.5\". I wasn't hopping around like Lizzo, but I was still moving around doing things. My mom ,on the other hand, is 5'6 and is hovering around 260/270 rn. And although I never would have described her as lazy in the past, I couldn't even get her to walk the entirety of the 3 blocks to the post office with me.", "It does suck and unfortunately the relationship between the son and his wife was ruined becuase of this. Him staying with her would most likely make things worse because he'll be unhappy and stressed.", "Not only that, it seems people forget while in the shower, that heat makes you sweat. I recently moved to an area that gets hotter in the summer. I noticed that my pits were getting a bit ripe while brushing my teeth, a thing I do right after a shower. I toned down the water temperature and that seemed to resolve it.\n\nFactor in the physical exertion basic things take at that size, it doesn't matter if they reach the area, by the time they've rinsed off the soap, they're just as sweaty as before, if not more.\n\nEdit: a comma", "Yes, it makes SUCH a difference.\n\nThis is why falls can be so disabling for the elderly, too - use it or lose it. If you're bedbound for a couple of months, muscle rehab is brutal. They make hip op patients walk the next day.", "Not a fact.  \n\nI\u2019ve been \u201cmorbidly obese\u201d since my teens and per the intensive cardiology workup I just had done while trying to figure out why I can\u2019t breathe AND exercise at the same time at all, my cardiovascular system is PERFECT.  Not even the tiniest hint of any kind of blockage or hardening or malfunction or damage of any kind and BP is perfect.\n\nAll the women in my family have been fat, and they\u2019ve all lived to at least 90.  \n\nY\u2019all are just stuck with my fat ass for at least a few more decades!  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think it's coming from you saying that this is a NAH situation, when the conflict being asked about is between OP, who is supporting her son, and the niece who is calling her son things for getting the kids out of that situation and saying he shouldn't have done any of what he's done.", "I'm sometimes the opposite. I can hate the sound of the shower, while I do enjoy soaking in the bath tub, semi-floating in weightlessness. My skin also feels so much cleaner after a bath...\n\nOf course, I will always shower off afterwards."]}
