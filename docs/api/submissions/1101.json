I decided to record the conversation.\n\nI went to my counselor(who is the same counselor for my sister since we have the same last name), and showed him the conversation. I think he was surprised that I told him, but he thanked me anyway. Apparently, my sister is suspended for a day and she has a permanent mark on her high school record, and she came home crying. I guess my counselor did not tell her that I recorded a conversation since she didn't seem to be mad at me.

Do you hate your sister for some reason and you were getting her back?", "YTA, mind your own business.", "INFO: Why the hell would you do that?", "YTA here\u2019s the thing, her cheating has no effect on you, it\u2019s going to catch up to her one day when she ends up in a position where she needs to know something but doesn\u2019t because she cheated and she will be penalized somehow, that\u2019s just natural consequences. You inserting yourself into the situation did absolutely nothing productive. Patience is a virtue it would have caught up to her eventually.\n\nAlso it\u2019s super shitty to randomly record peoples conversations, who the hell does that", "YTA. I find it a bit disturbing that, upon eavesdropping on your sister\u2019s private conversation, your knee-jerk reaction is to pull out your phone and record it.\n\nThen, instead of bringing this to your parents and allowing them\u2014as the adults and her parents\u2014to make an informed decision on how to address it, you instead weaponized this evidence against your sister and escalated it to an authority figure legally required to report it.\n\nYour sister was wrong to cheat. But you, as a 17-year-old, know what the academic consequences are for her cheating. YTA because you made multiple, calculated choices that ultimately ensured her punishment would be the longest and most damaging it could be. Her cheating needed to be addressed, but it is NOT your place as her sibling to be judge, jury, and executioner.", "YTA \n\nGoogling answers isn\u2019t that big of a deal, it wasn\u2019t like she was plagiarizing. You should\u2019ve talked to your parents or maybe told her that she shouldn\u2019t be googling answers if it\u2019s not allowed for that class. In the grand scheme of things, it does not matter that she googled answers for a high school test. But having this mark on her permanent record and having a suspension can genuinely hurt her chances of getting into a competitive school. That was really mean. And recording her? That\u2019s such an invasion of privacy that she can\u2019t talk to friends in her own home without being recorded.", "ESH - Cheating is wrong, but why did you have to rat out your sister\u2026 tell your parents, not the school. Also don\u2019t secretly record people.", "Never record people secretly YTA", "YTA\n\nYour first instinct is to record your sister's private conversations. Then, you bypass talking to your twin or your parents and go straight to the counselor. Finally, you have no remorse for your actions. You had so many chances to handle this better, and you took the low road every time.", "With friends like you, huh.\n\nWhat makes it way worse is that it was your twin sister!\n\nYTA, I can only imagine what kind of person you will be like to work with in the future.", "Yta, what purpose did that serve? What did you gain from this?", "YTA! Record people's private conversations in their homes and give the recording to school? You must really hate your twin sister! I would have talked to the parents and let them decide since they are your guardians.", "YTA you should move out and never return home.  They are much better off without you in their life.  LITERALLY.", "YTA you could have handled that multiple better ways. \n\nYour counselor had no reason to disclose who told him nor should he have disclosed who told him. But holy crap that information not slipping out saves your home life.", "YTA. What did your sister do to you to make you hate her so?", "Info: Did you verify if she Googled this before or after the test?", "YTA, Why would you do this? you should have just let it be bro\n\nmean brother FR", "YTA. It just wasn\u2019t necessary.", "YTA jesus you sound awful and pathetic", "YTA, as someone who has struggled with math their whole life and is just the one subject they can\u2019t seem to grasp for anything, wtf is wrong with u in all seriousness? What you did was cruel.", "You illegally recorded your sister saying something incriminating (which may or may not have been true or interpreted correctly) in her own home, where she previously felt safe.\n\nYou used this recording to get her into trouble with the school administration.\n\nUnless you're an idiot, you understood that her future would potentially be ruined by this, and you coldly proceeded.\n\nYou not only sabotaged her future, you made her home into an untrustworthy place where she can't feel safe anymore.\n\nYTA YTA YTA YTA. You officially win the \"worst brother ever\" award. What the hell, bro? Do you hate your sister? Do you enjoy superiority or watching others suffer?\n\nSome things are forgivable, but not this. If I were her, I'd press charges against you and never speak to you as my brother again.", "Duh YTA, mind your own business and why are you eavesdropping? \n\nLuckily a permanent mark on a high school record means nothing.", "ESH. Technically, you were in the right. Plagiarizing/cheating has much bigger consequences when somebody is in college. Learning this lesson now could save her from getting kicked out and losing a ton of money on tuition. But you also ratted on your twin and definitely stepped out into something that wasn't your business. I'm leaning towards youre mostly not the asshole because you had good intentions. But you need to be really careful in the future. Do not assume that it will work out every time.", "YTA.  \n\nWhy did you feel this was necessary other than some kind of vindictive measure against her?  If it was that important, why not just talk with your sister before blasting her to the school counselor?\n\nPeople get ahead in life through all kinds of means, most we never even know.  A majority of them through fair means, and some are not.  The fact remains, unless you are directly inhibited by those actions and/or the offenses are so egregious they'll cause others harm... I don't see the need to \"snitch\" so to say in this specific circumstance before consulting with your sister.", "YTA. For multiple reasons. You betrayed your sister. And you told. Snitching or appealing to authorities is vindictive, pathetic stuff. Especially over something that doesn't hurt anyone. Especially over something so minor. Especially on your close family. \n\nYou got something put on her school record that might affect her future over googling some answers for a bullshit standardized test even though you had nothing to gain. Man. Wow. Have fun not being trusted ever. \n\nYou deserve it.", "YTA!! like damn, first you record a convo without telling anyone and then you decide to tattle tell? \n\nWhy did you do this? Are you in some sort of competitive relationship with ur sister or what? Does she cheat all the time and you wanted to teach her a lesson? Like??? \n\nPeople Google shit ALL THE TIME, it's not cheating to look stuff up. Sometimes you just don't know the answer and in the real world people look things up and use the answers they researched for.\n\nWhat you did could prevent colleges from taking her in. So disappointing and weird as fuck for a sibling to do.", "YTA\n\nThis wasn\u2019t about her entering a prestigious university or achieving a certain award thatd warrant such a response to your PARENTS PRIMARLY; you literally did it out of maliciousness. Is the hate that real that you\u2019d pull a phone out to record immediately upon discovering your sister did something so minor?", "YTA, snitch. One day you'll learn that academic honesty really doesn't mean anything and there's never going to be a time in your adult life where you aren't able to just look up the answers if you don't know them. You should have talked to her or your parents privately and given her a chance to improve before punishing her.", "Wow mirror said you were the lowest of them all, why tf would you do that? She shouldnt have done that but you might just have RUINED HER LIFE? WHY WHY WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?", "YTA. There was no reason to do this other than to purposely be an AH to your sister. You're a horrible brother.", "YTA\n\nAre you jealous of her grades?", "YTA 1) you should not record people without their knowledge 2) people should be able to consider their home as their safe space 3) since your sister isn\u2019t aware it was you, it\u2019s likely she will blame the friend she told, causing upset and distress 4) she might have been bragging, you don\u2019t even know how truthful it was, she might have done one and exaggerated or not done any at all but wanted to look edgy. \n\nAll in all, don\u2019t be a creep and mind your own business", "YTA. It\u2019s you\u2019re literal twin sister, you could\u2019ve talked to her first. It sounds like you\u2019re jealous of her and knew exactly what type of impact it would have on her life. I hope she finds out what you did because asshole doesn\u2019t even begin to cover what you are.", "YTA and people will always see you as this, terrible personality trait. Mind your own business next time and you'll do a lot better.", "YTA I also think cheating is wrong, but the context here makes a big difference. If you don't have any intimacy with your twin sister and you don't think twice snitching on her, you are broken. You've been extremely cold recording the conversation and not talking with her at all. You've been extremely cold observing her cry and not knowing who betrayed her. And afterwards you write on Reddit because you want to enjoy other's reactions just because you're emotionless. Of course you'll never accept any comment that will say that you're wrong because you don't actually care and you'll defend yourself just saying that cheating is wrong. But you're just mean and predictable. People like you are born bored, unsatisfied, control and malice are the only think that bring \"something\" to their life, but you can't feel happyness. Just hate, jealousy and boredom. Nowadays people like you doesn't have life that easy anymore, we are all becoming aware about toxicity and how to deal with it. The funny part is that there people like you always think he/she is the smartest but you're just delusional, pathetic, mean, a symptom of your illness. There's no therapy for people like you, you're condemned to this life, you'll never feel our happyness and love. You can only observe it from outside and say to yourself that we are weak because of our feelings. Because you despise what you cannot have.", "Info:\n\nWhy are you so jealous of your sister?", "Eh, it depends how you look at it. Tricky.\n\nIn a sense, you\u2019re TA for \u201cbetraying\u201d your sister\u2019s trust (even if she doesn\u2019t know), but NTA because it was the honest thing to do which showed your academic integrity. \n\nCheating does have real life repercussions. What do others think?", "Soft YTA - your sister will learn a very variable lesson here due to the permanent mark on her record, and it should at least make her reconsider cheating in the future. That being said, why didn't you let your parents know and have them be the ones to have this conversation with her?", "YTA - Why would you snitch to your own twin sister????? Ok I admit she was wrong to cheat but who doesn't cheat a bit in high school exams? If she find out that it was you, she will be so pissed.", "I'm probably going to get downvoted to heck for this, but academically *and* morally, you are NTA.\n\nCheating is **always** wrong, and it's better your sister learns that now, in high school, than later on in college when the consequences will be more more dire.\n\nSounds like your sister needed this lesson in **academic integrity** before it was too late to change her ways. If a person cannot understand the material well enough to pass a course without cheating, then they do not deserve to pass.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just about everyone has cheated on a test, and its not like she was stealing someone's major work. Its not like she hurt anyone if she cheated on one test. Hell, some teachers don't even care. I am pretty sure my junior math teacher new I would cheat. Cause even if we randomized sitting by randomly grabbing, my friend and I would always sit together. Granted, we didn't help each other that much, just how to worked out the problem if we could not remember (Never shared answers). Or in my senior year, rather my two of paper got lost or I forgot to turn it them in, my teacher told me he was just going to put hundreds into the grade book.\n\nYou made a much bigger deal out of it then it needed to be, and I cannot wonder why?

How is he N T A for deliberately trying to sabotage his sister\u2019s future education? Also, yes she shouldn\u2019t have cheated, but nearly everyone has cheated at least once at some point during high school. Give me a break. It\u2019s not plagiarism.", "Yeah and I find it hard to believe OP has never googled an answer. I sure have plus if I google it and answer I normally remember it pretty well. Obviously not a study technique but for the occasional question it works well.", "It\u2019s only illegal if you aren\u2019t prt of the conversation , otherwise it is legal. In the case of OP it was clearly illegal.", "Your laws are broken - it should illegal unless everybody has agreed.

It really means nothing.", "So you purposely hurt your sister, YTA instead of talking to her", "And you are proud of that?

I think OP feels guilty, but I don't think he had malicious intentions.\n\nI stand by my judgment. The argument that \"nearly everyone has cheated at least once\" is fallacious. The fact that *some* people (or even *a lot* of people) do immoral things does not make those things morally correct.", "Why do you think he feels guilty? He gives no indication of that. Of course he had malicious intentions, he wanted to get his sister into trouble. Why else would he go out out of his way to record the conversation and show it to the counselor ?\n\nThe point is, cheating on a test is not such a big deal. It\u2019s not such a horrific moral misgiving and most people do so at least once during their high school career.
