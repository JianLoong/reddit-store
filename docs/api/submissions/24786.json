But actually expecting it and getting mad about there not being mixed drinks for brunch is weird.", "While I would probably treat myself to a mimosa (or whatever specialty drink the place is offering) should I already be going out for brunch any way, it's certainly not something I would *expect* at a housewarming brunch, especially not when it's just the immediate family. Hell, I can't remember the last time we had drinks at Grandma's holiday dinners. She rarely, but does, drink. It's just not a thing for the holidays", "Right. Like I think people below saying \u201cyou only associate brunch with booze if your family is full of alcoholics\u201d are being disingenuous but that could be a cultural thing. But regardless of the context, calling your sister a bitch and saying you wouldn\u2019t have bothered to see her if, like, any particular thing wasn\u2019t present (eggs? Bagels? Whatever) is weird and bad.", "Agreed. Being in a State with Legalized Maryj, I have never heard of it referred to as Smokes...", "I've only heard it referred to in the singular. Anytime someone has said \"smokes\" (plural), they've meant cigs. If someone is saying \"smoke\" (singular), then they mean pot. At least this is the case in my area of the US.", "I'm from Michigan and my friends and I always referred to pot as smokes. We also were a friend group where no one smoked cigs but a decent amount of them smokes pot. Idk Maybe it was just us and were weird.", "I'm 28 from the US and when I hear smokes I think cigarettes too\n\nI wonder if it has to do with those who were in high school before states starting legalizing versus after", "Did you read the op?\n\nOr are you on the wrong thread?", "lol you are right, and this other person is weird. Why would any assume a sober person went and bought booze for your 11am breakfast? lmao", "Other than having gusts over for a meal. You're right.", "Or a Four Loko. Keep it extra classy", "This one way to expose alcoholics. A regular drinker won't touch the stuff but an alcoholic will take whatever swill piss you have.", "Or MD (Maddog) 20/20. There's classy and there's *classy*.", "I mean, they could just be rude and ungrateful boors. This sub throws around the \"alcoholic\" accusation very freely.", "This^ as an alcoholic (who is 14 years sober now) I concur that this behavior is very inline with being alcohol dependent.", "Thats also a possibility lol. My friends also smoked pot, and practically no one cigarettes. I'm from Massachusetts. \n\nBut weird definitely isnt a bad thing lol. Stay weird my dude! <3", "Oh, geez, thanks for the \"old\" label. Believe it or not, those of us in our 40s do know that smokes these days doesn't refer to cigarettes.", "I read it and am in the right place. I don't think you are though.", "Even better! OP, we solved your problem for future events.", "When my state was contemplating banning those, I had to try one out to see what the big deal was....\n\nWorst stomachache ever, I'd never have another.", "Did you read where her guests said they'd have brought drink if they knew she had decided that there would be no drink?\n\nNo?\n\nOK.", "Again,  not having alcohol at one meal isn't taking away anyone's choice. When people go to work and eat lunch at places that do not serve or allow alcohol,  do people complain that their job is taking away their choice to drink at lunch? Of course not.  They still have the ability to go drink, just not at that time. And only one person complained. Everyone else was fine. The issue is that one single person out of the whole party couldn't go without alcohol and threw a fit. The problem isn't the lack of alcohol, it's that one person can't go without it.", "Threw a fit?\n\nI see.\n\nI'm going to slowly back away now.  Enjoy your kool-aid", "Yeah,  he got upset there was no alcohol, called OP to complain and called her a bitch because he couldn't go one meal without a drink. Calling it a fit was being nice. He was really being an ass.  \n\n Bye!!", "Damn say you\u2019re an alcoholic without saying you\u2019re an alcoholic\u2026"]}
