People do not conform to social expectations for all kinds of reasons, all the time. Nobody should be shamed for choosing not to have alcohol at a wedding, or not providing it for an event like brunch. \"I wouldn't have gone if I knew there wasn't alcohol\" is a really silly position to take even if you're polite about it. Honestly, if someone invites you to a wedding and you realize you wouldn't go if they didn't serve alcohol, just don't go. Nobody wants to feel like they're only appreciated when booze is involved and personally I wouldn't want anyone to celebrate with me if they wouldn't do so sober.", "That's his thing.  Clearly it is not yours.  \n\nI wonder about people who really seem anxious when there is no alcohol, and give all sorts of reasons for why it SHOULD be there.\n\nCan't those folks socialize and have fun without booze?", "Yes me too! I don't drink coffee, tea, alcohol, fruit flavored water or even milk, I always take my own Cola. I also drink water, lol. (No alcohol because of medicine).", "It\u2019s totally fine and good to not have booze for everything. But to say you would -never- do it when your guests are driving doesn\u2019t make any sense for the 30% of the country who doesn\u2019t have public transportation of any kind whatsoever. So he can say that\u2019s his thing, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a weird thing because a huge portion of the population manages to have a couple drinks and drive home just fine.", "I would say that mimosas are a brunch staple, but I wouldn\u2019t expect someone who doesn\u2019t drink alcohol to serve them at a brunch they\u2019re making at their home. \n\nIf I went out to brunch & there were no mimosas, get a pitchfork, but at my sister\u2019s when I know she hasn\u2019t drank in years? Whatever.", "I dont drink either but that wouldn't stop me from providing options for other people knowing they do drink.  People typically do drink at brunch and for a lot of people mimosas are the selling point.  And with her just moving out it seems surprising that she wouldn't know her family likes to drink? They seemed pretty upfront about it so I would assume living with them it would be obvious what they like.", "With salmon! A Fancy Brunch at that. The whole point of the visit was to see the place anyways. Why should she have to coax everyone over with food, never mind mixed drinks. Yikes.", "I'm \"old\" and knew perfectly well what you meant.", "Yeah, I know people who would react the same way or worse, but this is her family. They know she doesn\u2019t drink. If I went to a friend\u2019s brunch and we spent most of our time together drinking, I\u2019d expect them to have mimosas. But if I went to my sister\u2019s house and knew she didn\u2019t drink, I\u2019d be surprised if she did provide alcohol. \n\nI don\u2019t drink, but I don\u2019t think that makes a difference.", "Yeah, this is me in pretty much any situation. I\u2019m a bartender by trade so I always expect booze but I\u2019m never mad if not present. They should have asked if there would be any Bloody Mary or Mimosa. In fact, with brunch, planning the Bloody Marys could have been a fun activity because so many people love to load them up.", "Strawberry Hill has a nice bouquet, but Boone's Farm Apple is good for long hours a steady drinking.\n\nBoth are crazy bad, but are like pure spring water compared to Mad Dog 20/20.  Did Mogen David even know just what kind of bio-weapon they had created?", "If it was 5 servings, it'd be split in 5. Thus, it's a single serving. Checkmate, temperance folks.", "B-B, were you at Washington State in the 70's?! That was exactly the booze I was swilling (or the swill I was boozing with).  The worst hangover of my long life was on Mad Dog 20/20. UGGHH!  It was easy going down, and eventually, was easy coming back up as well.  Forty-eight hours to feel like a functioning human again.\n\nThen I discovered weed . . .", "I was a freshman in college\u2014on a dry campus\u2014when they were big (and before they removed the caffeine) in 2009-2010. I can\u2019t even tell you how many kids I watched taken out of the dorms on stretchers, or kids that absolutely *should* have been taken out on stretchers but their friends were too scared of getting in trouble. \n\nIn October 2009 we had a big party at this really shitty cabin in the middle of nowhere as a joint birthday for my brother\u2019s 19th and a friend\u2019s 21st. I was a fairly experienced drinker at this point, I wasn\u2019t like \u201cI can drink anyone under the table\u201d, but I could handle a decent amount of super cheap vodka and rarely puked unless it was the end of the night and I was trying to avoid my bed spinning all night. At that party, I drank not even a half of a 4-Loko and I ended up being the first one to throw up, out of the like 50+ kids that were there. The party started the night before the actual date of the birthday, and I missed the midnight \u201ccountdown to 21\u201d because I was outside barfing. I never again touched another 4-Loko lol. They didn\u2019t even taste that good. They had like zero redeeming qualities.", "I'm a little terrified to know what's in that shit. Due to a fun genetic quirk similar to the people who taste cilantro differently but apparently more rare because I've only ever met a couple other people with this unfortunate trait, I seem to taste the 'noble rot' fungus that's part of what turns grapes into wine, and all grape wines taste moldly to me...except Boones.", "Okay but it\u2019s not about \u201conly being appreciated if you provide booze\u201d it\u2019s about creating the atmosphere you want. If you book your own wedding to have a DJ and a dance floor and go late into the night it\u2019s definitely not weird for guests to expect alcohol to be served. I had a sunset ceremony and dinner, the entertainment was low key music and a bonfire and people had fun without getting drunk. We had our reception a year later and booked a live band and a food truck, had silly yard games and people got tipsy and danced. It\u2019s a celebration, not a normal Tuesday. But you did kind of prove the point that people in this sub are eager to rant about how everyone is an alcoholic.", "I went to a champagne breakfast at a winery in Aus once after hot air ballooning but I thought it was odd and didn't drink any champagne, mostly because I was a p plater. \n\nI've seen a few bottomless brunch places in Melboirne but they're specifically advertised as bottomless brunch, not just brunch"]}
