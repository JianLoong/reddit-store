If you're accepting invites, I know a couple good recipes for NA drinks. Drinking culture is lame with the expectation that you either drink or are a small child with baby taste buds.", "I don't understand. It's lunchtime. If you throw a party in the evening, you might argue that you should inform people about there not being alcohol. But would you have to inform them there's no salmon? Or no carrot cake? If you can't survive an afternoon without alcohol, maybe it's best if you always bring your own, but it would be better if you seek help.", "I'm not trying to argue, I just don't really understand. Should I have texted them \"I have sausages, bacon and salmon. If you want ham you have to bring it.\" too? Where's the line?", "OP doesn\u2019t drink therefore doesn\u2019t keep it in the house. \n\nI rarely drink. My mum knows this. So when she comes to visit for major holidays she brings a bottle of wine or something for dinner. \n\nThat\u2019s like saying because not everyone deals drugs they\u2019re sanctimonious because they can\u2019t supply every Tom, Dick, and Harry who wants a bump at a party. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. They know OP cannot drink, anyone with a logical brain would know that means OP likely doesn\u2019t have alcohol.\n\nBut when dealing with alcoholics, logic doesn\u2019t usually come into play\u2026", "I just didn't understand for sure what you meant, English isn't my first language.", "You are always at the mercy of what a host decides to serve. Are you actually ok with her brother calling her a bitch over alcohol particularly after the big spread of food she put out? She provided other beverages. If I know someone doesn't drink, I don't then assume they will then provide me with alcohol in their home. I have served it in my home and not served it in my home, usually depending on the occasion. I was always thanked for my efforts.", "This is not unusual. A lot of meds require, or at least strongly recommend, that folks to abstain from alcohol if they take them.", "Weird. The only one i can ever think of that did was a bridal brunch. Any others no unless they were at a restaurant.  I wouldn't think of it either if i was hosting one at home and bloody Mary's are one of my favorite drinks.", "Ahhh okay that makes sense. When I said old I was referring to being an American between 40-60. You are right, it's more of a cultural difference. I lived in a state that legalized Maryj when I was in high school so that made a huge cultural shock to us. A lot of our phrases and slangs are similar to our parents but mean different things because of it.", "Oh, I\u2019m aware of that. My curiosity was more so about the type of meds & if they were long term/short term or for a sensitive reason why the family should be more considerate. None of which is my business or makes much of a difference to OPs post - just my brain doing overtime & trying to fill in gaps"]}
