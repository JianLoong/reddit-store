Any time an adult makes you uncomfortable, even if they are a close relative, you should tell a trusted adult. Proud of you! You did the right thing", "NTA. Your dad sounds like hard work. Unsure if he's a creep or just really out of touch. If he's one of those guys that likes sexual or sexist humour then he probably just sees it as talking to you as an adult. However as a daughter I would hate to hear my dad say anything gross. Keep telling him that you don't like it, it's gross and inappropriate. He will either take it on board and make efforts to change or he won't, if he doesn't you will at least be able to move away soon", "NTA, you can't be the asshole for snitching on your dad because there is no such thing as snitching. People just say that to shame actual honest individuals into keeping quiet", "NTA. What he said to you both times is inappropriate. Making sex jokes with YOUR CHILD, particularly in an accusatory way, is gross. It's an unhealthy boundary to establish for both of you. The fact that it even crossed his mind to suggest you looked like a pole dancer at 12 is kind boggling to me. \n\nMy dad used to tell my 7 years younger sister (never in my presence because I would have ripped him a new one) that she should get a job at Hooters when she grows up because she has huge boobs. \ud83e\udd2e\n\nSo I completely understand how uncomfortable your dad's comments must be making you. You did the right thing by telling your aunt. He's accusing you of snitching because he was wants to make you feel guilty for establishing a boundary. That's a him problem. Keep calling him out when he says gross stuff like that.\n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with that creepy shit.", "NTA\n\nYou should always tell a trusted adult if someone is making you uncomfortable, especially in a sexual way.\n\nYou dad should be embarrassed.", "NTA. If there was nothing wrong in what he was saying, then he wouldn't need to worry about you telling your aunt.", "NTA \n\nTRUST YOUR GUT!!!!!!! Just because he\u2019s your dad, doesn\u2019t give him a pass, lots (maybe not lots, but too frigging many) of dad\u2019s creep on their kids. \n\nHe\u2019s testing your boundaries. It\u2019s what predators do. Keep calling him out. Keep telling your aunt. Every. Single. Time!!!!! Keep yourself safe.", "Damn, it\u2019s terrible parents o\u2019clock on AITA. You are not the asshole here", "NTA, good you got your aunt involved, maybe this will make him stop. It\u2019s not snitching, you and her are just trying to protect you. It\u2019s good that you know she has your back! Your dad is definitely in the wrong here.", "NTA.  That was weird and it's ok to seek help from another adult.", "NTA\n\nYou told your dad he made you uncomfortable and he ignored you. It was the right thing for you to do to get support from your Aunt. You didn't cause any harm, you were getting help for yourself. That is never wrong. And your dad dismissing you and your aunt as fussing over nothing is very wrong of him. Hopefully he's just saying that to save face and he stops saying inappropriate things to you. But if he doesn't please don't hesitate to ask for help again.", "NTA. Your father\u2019s \u201cjokes\u201d are inappropriate for a 15 year old girl, let alone anyone. You expressed to him that you didn\u2019t like these jokes, and he continued the behavior. I think it\u2019s awesome you had the ability to reach out to someone you trust to speak about this with.", "You did the right thing. He's mad bc he got called out. If he was really unaware his reaction would be completely different. I would keep my head down and talk to my aunt about moving in with her if I didn't have any other options. Document EVERYTHING with pics, notes, video, etc. whatever you can get. You stay strong and keep sticking up for yourself. With luck he'll back off until you can get out. Listen to your gut.", "I would reach out to your school counselor. What he says to you is NOT ok. And it wouldn't be \"snitching\", It would be standing up and saving yourself from a predator. NTA", "NTA\nYour father sounds like a bad father with an immature attitude, I hope he reflects and realizes that you get uncomfortable with those comments and \"jokes\" that he makes", "NTA. You should set a boundaries with your father, this is very inappropriate...", "NTA. You're 15. Dads can be weird. It's hard to build up a good rapport, especially between daughter and father. The dad might need to learn some self-reflection skills. If something bothers you, then it's worth thinking about. It's not about getting your dad in trouble.", "NTA. Maybe he's just out of touch, but I find it creepy AF for a man to make sexual comments about/around their close female relatives. (Or vice versa, now that I think about it.) If there's any \"betrayal\" here, it's that he's making you feel unsafe.", "NTA\n\nHe is being dismissive of your feelings.

That kind of talk about someone who is that young can end up with the person making those comments in jail.", "It\u2019s not ok that your dad jokes like that, and it was really really brave of you to tell someone you trust.

Keep an open dialogue with your aunt, and any other adult you trust. Your dad\u2019s behaviour is not normal. Frankly, it\u2019s disgusting.\n\nI would even tell your aunt that he got mad at you, for expressing your discomfort. Keep bringing it up to adults you trust. And warn your dad that you will  speak your mind to your aunt, if he continues to be gross.", "NTA. Your dad certainly is one. Who the fuck talks to their 15 year old daughter like that?", "Telling your aunt was the best thing you could have done. I don't know if he's a predator or not but if he'd said the same things to an adult female coworker it would be called sexual harassment and he'd probably get fired. How dare he say it to a child! Your unease is valid. You are NTA and not a snitch either.", "NTA\n\nI'm a lot older than you, and unpacking in therapy now, the ways my dad made me feel *unsafe* in my childhood home when was your age, and how that's affected me as an adult. Basically feeling unsafe like that can rewire your brain for protection over connection which can cause you to make unhealthy decisions down the road.\n\nTrust me when I say - it is much better to have all this in the open, than swept under the rug. Silence protects him and hurts you. Continue to tell your aunt and other adults who make you feel safe. Tell her the pole dancer comment too. Keep speaking up.", "This is really worrying, my skin crawled reading this. Your dad is a huge creep. Be careful and stay close to your aunt.

It\u2019s good life advice in general, not just about your dad. \n\nThis is what it boils down to. Your dad said something that made you uncomfortable. You asked him to stop. He doesn\u2019t listen. Because he ignores you, he forces your hand to call your aunt.  Every time he makes a comment like that, call your aunt. Hopefully eventually he will get the picture. \n\nLet\u2019s be clear - you are not a snitch. Your dad is only calling you that because he\u2019s embarrassed.  You didn\u2019t spill a secret to your aunt, you just repeated a random comment. If he doesn\u2019t want to be embarrassed then he shouldn\u2019t say things like that anymore. Actions have consequences.", "I agree", "It seems like even the aunt knows that this is beyond creepy.", " I'm usually on team \"oh my god just talk to them,\" but it is definitely not a young woman's job to tell her father that he shouldn't make gross sexualized remarks about her."]}
