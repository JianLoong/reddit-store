They tried to get close but it didn't work out and somehow, things got worse between them after he allegedly accused her of taking his watch and selling it. Police were involved and she moved with her dad after paying my husband for the watch. That took place last year. She made a mistake but she had her reasons.\n\n\nI asked Stacey to come join us for christmas and have christmas dinner with us since she will be moving away to study aboard. She agreed to come but said she wouldn't feel comfortable sitting with my husband at dinning table. I tried to think of a comprpmise but couldn't find one other than yo ask my husband to eat his plate in the kitchen. He initially refused and sat at dinning table and had an attitude about it being his house but I tried to explain how this was my last chance to spend christmas with her. And it wasn't like I asked him to leave the house. I asked him again to get up and go eat dinner in the kitchen but he refused. He said it's his house and he get to sit wherever he wanted. I insisted saying he was causing Stacey to get uncomfortable and cause a scene. He still refused and sat still. Next I grabbed his plate and was going to take it to the kitchen but he took it out of my hand and sternly told me he wasn't going anywhere. A big argument ensued and Stacey and the family ended up leaving and dinner being finished before it even started. I argued with him about ruining my last christmas with my daughter but he went on about it being his house. I told him he escalated it and should've done this favor for me but chose to act stubbornly instead.

She got caught.\n\nYou\u2019ve ruined Christmas by trying to justify her actions and essentially punishing your husband for calling Stacey out. You banished him from the table. WTF is wrong with you?!!", "Jesus lady, you are messed up. YTA.", "YTA - if my spouse treated me the way you treated your husband I would be considering a divorce. Your daughter sounds horrifically entitled and unable to deal with the fall out caused by her bad behavior. I\u2019m going to guess that\u2019s because you have consistently shielded her from real world consequences.", "So she said she would come to dinner but only if her victim was not present at dinner in his house?

This question really needs to be asked?\n\nYTA, big time.", "Dysfunction doesn't even begin to cover this.    Your first paragraph is a bit confusing.  You mention the word \"allegedly\" as if the husband wrongfully accused your daughter of stealing his watch, but then a few sentences later, you say that she made a mistake.  So did she steal the watch?  And if so, did she lie about it until the point at which the police were involved and her lie was discovered?\n\nAlso, most of the post sounds as if it is just your daughter coming for dinner, but then you mention \"and family.\"  I am trying to visualize this event.  Were all of you . . . Stacey, your husband, other family members, and yourself all sitting at the dining room table, and then all of a sudden, your daughter says she is not comfortable eating in the same room as your husband . . . and you ask him to leave?  Is that how it played out because that sounds humiliating to your husband . . . especially . . . if he was not in the wrong about the watch.\n\nSome might argue that the part concerning the watch has no bearing on the Christmas dinner situation, but, for me, it does.  Establishing whether the relationship between your husband and daughter is irreparable because she stole from him, did not apologize and now holds a grudge . . . OR . . . she did not steal from him, was falsely accused, he did not apologize, and she has a grudge . . . has bearing on whether your expectations of your husband eating alone are warranted or you are coddling your daughter.\n\nIn any case, it feels like either everyone sucks or you do, primarily, simply because it sounds like all of this drama could have been 100% predicted and avoided.\n\nIf you knew that the relationship between your daughter and your husband was so terrible (and that seems likely) and one of your goals in having her over was NOT to provide an opportunity to repair it, then why did you not do one of the following:\n\n1. Celebrate the holiday with your daughter on another day, in which you could pre-arrange that your husband would not be there.\n2. Eat out at Chinese or Indian with your daughter earlier, leaving your husband behind, and then return to eat with him.  Obviously, you would have to eat smaller meals, or just do desert with him.", "[removed]", "Yeah, YTA, and to be honest, I personally would have been in contact with an attorney next business day because you obviously raised your thief of a daughter with good values and I can't see how your \"current\" husband would want to stand in the way of you and your privileged brat.", "YTA.

I\u2019d argue that you never should have invited her to your house to begin with. She *stole from your husband*. And it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s very apologetic about it.

First off, your daughter stole your husband's watch and sold it. You completely dismiss the seriousness of this by claiming that your daughter \"had her reasons\" for making this \"mistake.\" What possible reasons could your daughter have had for stealing from your husband? Don't answer that because that was rhetorical question!!! Second, your daughter has the unmitigated gall to try and dictate where your husband can be in his own fucking house after she stole from him saying his presence makes her uncomfortable? Do you know why your husband's presence makes your daughter uncomfortable OP? It's because he refused to be a doormat for your entitled, thieving daughter by laying down and not doing anything about his watch being stolen. The fact he held her feet to the fire and forced her to pay him back for what she stole from him is the ONLY reason why his presence makes her uncomfortable. He's probably been the FIRST and ONLY person who's ever made sure that girl faced consequences for her actions because it sure as hell wasn't you nor her own biological father.\n\n\"It wasn't like I asked him to leave the house,\" shit OP you might as well have because you're asking this man to accept being treated like a got damn misbehaving child by not being allowed to eat CHRISTMAS dinner with everyone at the table! I mean GOOD GOD OP, you couldn't have shown your husband, and I pray to God soon to be ex-husband that you couldn't care less about him if you tried. Now your soon to be ex-husband knows that when it comes to him or your daughter you will always choose her no matter what. This also showed your daughter that she can manipulate and guilt trip you into treating your husband any way she sees fit and you'll back her up every time. Hell, your daughter could've spit in your husband's face right there at the dinner table and there isn't a doubt in my mind that you would've told your husband to just go wash his face and cool off.

They tried to get close but it didn't work out and somehow, things got worse between them after he allegedly accused her of taking his watch and selling it. Police were involved and she moved with her dad after paying my husband for the watch. That took place last year. She made a mistake but she had her reasons.\n\n\nI asked Stacey to come join us for christmas and have christmas dinner with us since she will be moving away to study aboard. She agreed to come but said she wouldn't feel comfortable sitting with my husband at dinning table. I tried to think of a comprpmise but couldn't find one other than yo ask my hudband to eat his plate in the kitchen. He initially refused and sat at dinning table and had an attitude about it being his house but I tried to explain how this was my last chance to spend christmas with her. And it wasn't like I asked him to leave the house. I asked him again to get up and go eat dinner in the kitchen but he refused. He said it's his house and he get to sit wherever he wanted. I insisted saying he was causing Stacey to get uncomfortable and cause a scene. He still refused and sat still. Next I grabbed his plate and was going to take it to the kitchen but he took it out of my hand and sternly told me he wasn't going anywhere. A big argument ensued and Stacey and the family ended up leaving and dinner being finished before it even started. I argued with him about ruining my last christmas with my daughter but he went on about it being his house.
