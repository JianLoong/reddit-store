{"id": 28904, "submission_id": "177u85u", "title": "AITA for not telling my SIL about the life insurance policy my brother left for me?", "selftext": "7 years ago, my brother, Alan, made a seemingly rash decision to marry someone pretty suddenly, Jan. From very early on they had issues that she often brought to everyone (this is not how the family operates, and if I am being honest, she made everyone extremely uncomfortable multiple times by airing her grievances to anyone who would listen). Nothing major, no abuse or cheating or anything.\n\nDespite that, my family was warm to her because really it was Alan's life and decision. We accepted her and her child from a previous marriage and were thrilled when they welcomed a child together. I say I'm confident that, at the very least, Alan was leary of her because he called me out of the blue to remind me I was the beneficiary of his insurance policy and that he'd like me to use that money to create education funds for the kids. This conversation took place 2 years ago.\n\nWell, Alan died in an accident about 3 months ago. Jan has continued to utilize the family for help (Which is totally fine). I went through the process with the life insurance company and submitted all needed paperwork and everything seemed fine. I 100% intend to abide by Alan's wishes. Everything was OK with Jan until recently.\n\nRecently, Jan started acting outwardly hostile, accusing my and Alan's mother of \"stealing\" Alan's money. Jan, likely with the urging and help of a third party, went digging into information about life insurance and learned that there is a policy, though she could not get additional info as she is not the beneficiary. This appears to be where and when she decided to start acting hostile. She is outwardly confrontational to my mom (not me)\n\nI attempted to sit down with Jan and explain things with the help of a translator, believing that, perhaps, a language barrier and a lack of understanding of how these things work were creating problems (she is not originally from here). She went off screaming about how she's his wife and the money is hers and my mother is \"stealing\" from her. I tried to explain that my mother has nothing to do with this and I'm not \"stealing\" anything. She wants to hear none of it and seems to waffle between my mother forced my brother to make her the beneficiary (She's not on it) and there was no beneficiary (there is!). She also does not find it acceptable that this money will be going toward the children's educational needs. I don't understand why. She stormed off. I was mortified by her behavior. I left, apologized to the translator, and haven't attempted to speak with her again, although I've seen the children for already scheduled events.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not sharing this information with her initially?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Several people have mentioned Jan perhaps being concerned about finances. Her finances are fine. Additional funds have been dispersed to her and will continue to be. The children are in no danger, nor is she.

I would strongly recommend you to have a lawyer to help you and your mother to make sure you have access to your nephew. As for your brother's money, see if you can make a trust fund that the kids will have access to education but you will get to authorize their spending, because I wouldn't pass your SIL trying to take this money since she seems to think this should be hers.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your brother knew exactly what he was doing by protecting that money for his children.  \n\nDepending on the nature of his accident, Jan may be able to get some kind of settlement from that.  She may also be able to get Survivor's benefits from the government for their together.", "No, you are not.  There is not any way that it can be twisted to make you one either.  Given the money is to be used for her child that is not Alan's biological child and the child they both had together I am totally aghast why she is acting out and not grateful that your brother had the foresight and compassion to set it up this way, and with you as the person to manage it.\n\nShe does not sound like a grieving wife, but a greedy one at worst, and a controlling, irrational one at best.\n\nIf she is hesitant or afraid to be confrontational with you like she is with your mother, then just instruct your mother to avoid taking her calls when you are NOT around, and to avoid being alone with her, without you.\n\nAs nicely as possible, since children are involved and you want to maintain a relationship with them that will require her cooperation, I would write her a letter telling her these things:\n\n* That you are sure that the grief of losing your brother is causing her to react out of character in ways that are hostile to you and your mother, and that you know this is not normal for her.\n* That you and your mother are on her side and there for her and the children.\n* That you will abide by your brother's wishes and manage the money for their children's future and will provide a quarterly report on what the funds are (how they grow in whatever investments you do).\n* That when the time comes for the funds to be used you will provide documentation on how that will occur .. . . which should be direct payment of tuition and room/board so that she cannot intervene to get the money and redirect.\n\nAnd then, finally, please end the letter with you would be happy to sit down with her again and discuss things, but you will no longer tolerate her hostile behavior.\n\nBest of luck.", "It sounds like Jan just doesn't want to listen and doesn't want to understand.

Why didn't brother leave his insurance policy to his child, with you being the administrator if he wanted to cut out the wife? I mean, they're going to need money to live on before education is even an issue. Do you intend to use the money to pay for the child's expenses?", "I don't know why your brother left money to you instead of his wife. I'd be VERY upset if my husband would trust someone else more than me with education for our kids. I don't think it matters when I'd find out this kind of disappointing news.\n\nEdit: NAH", "NAH for you and SIL. Your brother was an AH though. He should have had a life insurance policy that went to his wife to help her actually get the kids to adulthood. To help pay for their home, vehicles etc. And he should have made it clear to her where his policies were going and for what reason. He omitted information and hid what would happen if he passed which has now created the current issue.", "NTA.   But was there another policy left to his wife in case of death?\nIs the house paid for? Does she work?\n\nWho knows his reasoning,  but I'd  be upset if my SIL  had insurance money sitting in savings for 15 years fir my kids college,  but I  no longer had husband's income to help with costs of raising them \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nAlan should have told Jan you were the beneficiary when he took out this policy. It's not up to you to bring it up to Jan since you're the beneficiary and it would be really random and morbid to say this stuff to someone when Alan wasn't even sick or dying. \n\nThis entire thing could have been avoided if Alan actually loved his wife and wanted to ensure that they were taken care of. He didn't do that and Jan can't be angry with a dead guy so she has to be angry with other people and that's where you, the beneficiary, comes in. \n\nJust ignore it. Set up the funds you promised to do (by the way Alan could have gone to a lawyer and done all this but he didn't and he out you in the tough spot). Alan could have made the kids the beneficiaries and because they're underage, set up a trust fund to have the funds dispersed at xyz terms. \n\nSorry you're in the shit situation your brother put you in.", "Hi so what I understand from this situation is that your In-law (Jan) recently lost her husband (your brother)  and is upset due to not being a beneficiary on what I am assuming is some sort of life insurance type of thing.\n\nNow i totally understand the woman's frustration on being left with nothing after committing to a 7 year relationship. It could possibly be frustration from grief. However, that still does not justify the fact that she is completely underestimating the feelings you could have from the loss of YOUR OWN BROTHER. I believe you are all on the same emotional boat right now but her behaviour is just not it but then again, facing the loss of someone you have known for close to a decade is tough. I recommend giving it some time. It may take a few months or maybe a few year however she cant hide the fact that the child she had with your brother has other family too. I believe from what you have written you and your family are more than willing to help her in taking care of her children. Plus the Brother could've told her about the insurance years before his death so I think it is lack of trust for Jan.\n\nTaking all this into perspective, I believe you should definitely give it some time however try to know of her and the children's well-being and I think she should grow a little warmer overtime. Just keep letting her know she has people to turn to in these tough times!\n\nI am truly sorry for your loss and I really hope you have people you can talk to as well! You are definitely NTA", "I'm in the minority but yes YTA. \n\nI mean your brother left money for his kids education. Why wouldn't you tell the mother that? That's kinda information she should know since it involves her kids. So yea I kinda get her point. In her mind you received money for her children and didn't tell her and hiding that information. Why wouldn't she believe you're trying to steal it. Not saying you are but for her that's not a huge jump in logic.\n\nEdit to add:  I'm guessing the child is 6 years or younger. Pretty sure that money would be more useful to their child now compared to waiting till college", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
