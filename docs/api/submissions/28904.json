{"id": 28904, "submission_id": "177u85u", "title": "AITA for not telling my SIL about the life insurance policy my brother left for me?", "selftext": "7 years ago, my brother, Alan, made a seemingly rash decision to marry someone pretty suddenly, Jan. From very early on they had issues that she often brought to everyone (this is not how the family operates, and if I am being honest, she made everyone extremely uncomfortable multiple times by airing her grievances to anyone who would listen). Nothing major, no abuse or cheating or anything.\n\nDespite that, my family was warm to her because really it was Alan's life and decision. We accepted her and her child from a previous marriage and were thrilled when they welcomed a child together. I say I'm confident that, at the very least, Alan was leary of her because he called me out of the blue to remind me I was the beneficiary of his insurance policy and that he'd like me to use that money to create education funds for the kids. This conversation took place 2 years ago.\n\nWell, Alan died in an accident about 3 months ago. Jan has continued to utilize the family for help (Which is totally fine). I went through the process with the life insurance company and submitted all needed paperwork and everything seemed fine. I 100% intend to abide by Alan's wishes. Everything was OK with Jan until recently.\n\nRecently, Jan started acting outwardly hostile, accusing my and Alan's mother of \"stealing\" Alan's money. Jan, likely with the urging and help of a third party, went digging into information about life insurance and learned that there is a policy, though she could not get additional info as she is not the beneficiary. This appears to be where and when she decided to start acting hostile. She is outwardly confrontational to my mom (not me)\n\nI attempted to sit down with Jan and explain things with the help of a translator, believing that, perhaps, a language barrier and a lack of understanding of how these things work were creating problems (she is not originally from here). She went off screaming about how she's his wife and the money is hers and my mother is \"stealing\" from her. I tried to explain that my mother has nothing to do with this and I'm not \"stealing\" anything. She wants to hear none of it and seems to waffle between my mother forced my brother to make her the beneficiary (She's not on it) and there was no beneficiary (there is!). She also does not find it acceptable that this money will be going toward the children's educational needs. I don't understand why. She stormed off. I was mortified by her behavior. I left, apologized to the translator, and haven't attempted to speak with her again, although I've seen the children for already scheduled events.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not sharing this information with her initially?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Several people have mentioned Jan perhaps being concerned about finances. Her finances are fine. Additional funds have been dispersed to her and will continue to be. The children are in no danger, nor is she.

It could possibly be frustration from grief. However, that still does not justify the fact that she is completely underestimating the feelings you could have from the loss of YOUR OWN BROTHER. I believe you are all on the same emotional boat right now but her behaviour is just not it but then again, facing the loss of someone you have known for close to a decade is tough. I recommend giving it some time. It may take a few months or maybe a few year however she cant hide the fact that the child she had with your brother has other family too. I believe from what you have written you and your family are more than willing to help her in taking care of her children. Plus the Brother could've told her about the insurance years before his death so I think it is lack of trust for Jan.\n\nTaking all this into perspective, I believe you should definitely give it some time however try to know of her and the children's well-being and I think she should grow a little warmer overtime. Just keep letting her know she has people to turn to in these tough times!\n\nI am truly sorry for your loss and I really hope you have people you can talk to as well! You are definitely NTA", "I'm in the minority but yes YTA. \n\nI mean your brother left money for his kids education. Why wouldn't you tell the mother that? That's kinda information she should know since it involves her kids. So yea I kinda get her point. In her mind you received money for her children and didn't tell her and hiding that information. Why wouldn't she believe you're trying to steal it. Not saying you are but for her that's not a huge jump in logic.\n\nEdit to add:  I'm guessing the child is 6 years or younger. Pretty sure that money would be more useful to their child now compared to waiting till college", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The brother calls OP out of the blue two years ago to inform him directly that, in the event something happens to him, he wants to make it clear that OP, not the brother's own wife, would be the beneficiary to the life insurance policy he had taken out on himself. This is suggestive for two reasons: for one, it suggests OP's brother felt it necessary to not only obtain a life insurance policy for himself (which in of itself isn't strange), but also to inform OP of that policy and his role within it. Secondly, it suggests that OP's brother felt imperative to make OP the beneficiary in the first place. That suggests that he did not trust his wife on the most basic level, which includes honoring his final wishes upon the event of his untimely death. That brings us to the untimely death part. Why inform his brother of the policy when he did? Calls OP up out of the blue, proclaiming him the beneficiary over his wife if he should untimely perish, then less than two years later he just so happens to have an untimely death? Then the wife comes nosing in about an insurance policy that no one knew she was aware of? Demanding it was hers?

On top of this, anger is one of the stages of grief, so she was likely going to be distortedly angry and someone eventually.  \n\nFor that, I can't call her an AH.
