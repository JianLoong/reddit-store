So for some context, I am black and tend to like to wear a lot of white and brighter colors in my day-to-day life but to get to the point quickly, I was looking at Tuxes/Suits for the wedding and was looking at a white floral-designed suit that is almost all white which felt like it would fit the more flowery and floral theme of the wedding plans.\r  \n\r  \nI was with my wife's brother just because he was going to be one of my groomsmen per my wife's requests. I was thinking that we could both figure out how to make the suits match or look well together while we were at the tailor's, but he seemed kind of weird when I wanted to buy the white suit, he said something like \"Don't you think white is more of a bride thing?\" but never thought much about it due to just knowing about grooms wearing white to their own weddings before.\r  \n\r  \nAbout 2 days after this shopping for suits time, I come home from work to my wife or future wife (whatever you want to say) and she's extremely upset and angry for seemingly no reason to me, so of course, I asked her what's wrong, thinking it was something wrong with the wedding or a wedding service not being done right. She proceeds to ask me How could I make the wedding all about myself. She told me her brother called her telling her that I wanted to buy a white suit. To be honest, after thinking about it for the past couple days, I actually wanted to just not do it and buy a normal suit to make her feel like the most important person on her special day.\r  \n\r  \nAfter letting her scream and yell her heart out at me, I was just sitting there and listening, not wanting to get upset myself regardless of her strange reaction but then she said \"You always make everything about you and I'm sick of it\". This actually struck a nerve in me because I would hear this all the time in my childhood and such about how I'm self-centered and selfish so as a adult in a relationship, I didn't want to be like this, I refused to ever let her or any other past relationship celebrate my birthday or buy me gifts for holidays or anything due to not wanting to be seen as selfish.\r  \n\r  \nFor the past week, I've been sleeping in my car since she kicked me out of our home for the time-being and wanted time to cool off. I don't have anyone to go to and don't want to have a pity-party with anyone I do know, but I have been thinking about this and kind of have been thinking that I'm truly in the wrong right now and maybe I actually am making her day about me and being selfish and the sort, so AITA for wanting to wear white?", "created_utc": 1695429140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pq9jt/aita_for_wanting_to_wear_white_to_my_own_wedding/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I personally think it would be cute for the bride and groom to match and in all honesty, the dress will always stand out more than a tux anyways so she has nothing to worry about. Also it never made sense to me that the bride gets to wear a vastly different dress from the bridesmaids, but the groom has to dress and look like the other groomsmen. It makes more sense for the bride and groom to both stand out since it is BOTH of your day, not just hers. If she wants the wedding to be all about her, tell her to marry herself.", "NTA. I would seriously consider whether this person is marriage material. Anyone who starts screaming & having that reaction before anything is even finalised sounds desperately unhinged.", "Welp. One thing is for sure. You should reconsider this wedding.  If you can't have a conversation about the color of your suit without being thrown out and sleeping in your car then you two aren't ready. NTA it doesn't sound like you were trying to upstage her and her reaction is unreasonable.", "NTA but, if you do get married, I see a divorce on the horizon.", "Nta and like, isn't the day Also About You, the groom? You know, the groom that's getting married too? Don't let her manipulate you. It's absolutely also about you! She's giving off some red flags, pay attention!", "ESH, but I'm not really sure about that. You guys need to figure out your shit BEFORE you get married.  If the story is exactly as you said then this is not a normal or healthy reaction and you should really be thinking hard if this is the type of person you want to spend your life with.  I am thinking there is a LOT of background and a whole different perspective we are missing here though.", "NTA. Or more precisely, you are not wrong for wanting to wear white, but your choice of bride really sucks. As you're falling asleep in your car tonight, consider whether this is the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with, because her temperament is not likely to get better once the honeymoon period wears off.", "NTA seems like a weird thing to be to get upset about. She could have just asked you not to. I think it would look nice provided the brides dress is also white. If hers is like champagne or rose or something, then it might look weird.", "NTA A wedding should be about both people not just the bride. I think her outburst is just the excuse you need to run from her as quickly as possible. You don't want to be a part of this family and you deserve to find someone who wants to celebrate you.", "First, NTA.  Your girlfriend sounds unhinged.  That said, sometimes brides get super weird about things, and you don't know how her brother framed it.  What's missing here is you and your GF having a conversation.  Think about what you want in a relationship, prepare yourself and what you need and what boundaries, and sit down and talk seriously about your future, the wedding, etc.  You don't know where you stand right now.", "Nothing wrong with wearing a white tux/suit, especially to your own wedding. It's a bit of a worry that she kicked you out of your house for this; are you sure you want to get married to her? It's also a bit worrying that you have no friends/family to ask for help in this situation. I don't think you're selfish for wanting to wear a white suit when you get married. I thought your fiance's proclamation sounded a bit like a diva trying to guilt trip when really she's just a hypocrite that wants all attention on her even thought you're *both* getting married, but the no friends situation gives me a bit of doubt about this.", "Edit: changed to NTA based on below comment. \n\nBUT, you need to halt this wedding.

You've been sleeping in your car over the color of a suit???? That's not ok dude. Are you really sure you want to marry someone who would that to you???", "NTA... She will absolutely dictate more things in your life that she doesn't approve of... Run away as fast as you can and don't look back", "NTA. The wedding is about BOTH of you.", "NTA. Major overreaction. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting a white suit and if she took issue with it, she could have discussed that with you like a rational person.\n\nI want to suggest therapy based on the way you talk about yourself at the end there. It\u2019s possible that you have a selfish streak, but it\u2019s also possible that you\u2019ve internalized some negative things said about you when you were a kid. Either way, there\u2019s got to be a balance that doesn\u2019t require you to make yourself small. You can celebrate holidays and accept gifts from people who care about you without being a bad person. Having someone to talk this all out with might help you figure out what\u2019s actually true here.", "NTA, dude, you have such a sweet heart, this is your day too. Its not hers, it's yours as a couple. \n\nI hate to say it but if that's how she reacted to something you wanted, fuck her brother for not being supportive or scared of an item of clothings colour. My heart goes out to you as you genuinely seemed excited and had an idea of what you wanted. Your (ex?) Fianc\u00e9e should be excited about you wanting to look at suit options but instead is being an asshole. I'm sorry but brides for think the day is just about them are worse than assholes. \n\nI hope you find happiness and rest and do not feel selfish but listened to and loved completely for who you are", "NTA at all\nAnd it's both of your wedding!\n\nA wedding is two people it's all about the bride and groom!\n\nI have seen the \"bride & groom\" wear white at many weddings, the groomsmen wore a different color. \n\nThe Bride is being selfish, talk about redflags! You might want to rethink your future with her.", "Honey, NTA. I am guessing your family projected their own selfishness onto you. Because that\u2019s what you grew up with, that behavior probably seemed normal and caused you not to see the red flags sooner with your fianc\u00e9e.", "Get your shit and get out!", "Do you not have any close friends who can help you see who you are? Because I cant' make a judgement about whether or not selfishness is a core trait you possess without knowing you. You seem like a reasonable guy, honestly ready to take responsibility for your actions.\n\nBut to the question of the Tux, I see nothing wrong with the groom wearing a white tux, or a white tux with accent colors. This isn't just the bride's day. It's SUPPOSED to be the COUPLE's day. Most couples figure these things out together. I'm surprised you haven't been included in the plans/themes. Usually there's colors, themes that the groom and his crew carry out with the bridesmaids.\n\nIt seems your bride has gone over the top. Maybe her brother pushed her up there. I hope she calms down and you can work this out. I don't know if you are who your family accused you of being or not. But I wonder if you chose a spouse who matched the warped dynamic that your family raised you in.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour future wife reacted very strongly, but if you didn't plan to just surprise her with it then I don't see an issue. Just tell her it was a random thought but you won't wear the white suit since she doesn't want you to. Maybe ask her if you could at least wear a lighter colored suit?", "NTA. Also the phrase \"you are always making everything about yourself\" gets thrown a lot when people/women just express feelings or thoughts (especially uncomfortable) and seems to me a mechanism to shut down anyone who advocates for oneself in any situation. I think at the heart of it is a severe lack of empathy and even the lack of willingness to deal with someone else.\n\nBasically these people are invalidating your feelings and thoughts and long term this is undermining your person. If you can, I would strongly recommend to go talk with a therapist especially if this is a childhood thing.\nI was always told I'm selfish and egomaniac as a child and it cost me a lot of money and effort to realize, just wanting something or anything at all is making you a person, not self absorbed.\n \nI base this analysis on two recent examples which to me show these phrases used as a way to shut someone else up when these people feel power less/overwhelmed.\nTwo examples: due to the pandemic my PhD defense and big celebration of it was threatened to be cancelled (ultimately it was). I had been depressed for most of my life and doing a PhD was, for most of my life, the only life goal I had. just meaning to say I really had been looking forward to celebrating it for five years. When I expressed how afraid I was about it being cancelled my supervisor told me \"it's not all about you, other people are suffering as well, I for example couldn't go to a conference\". At no point had I ever said anything about my PhD being more important than other things or even people dying or anything.\n\nAnother example was when I was trying to move to Japan but having my(all) visa(s) being voided two days before the flight due to omicron suddenly emerging. I called the embassy and asked what this meant and if I really couldn't fly even though I had a job lined up and stuff. The embassy told me they didn't have information and \"you are not the only person with problems\".\n\nIn both cases I think the response was a bit unfit.\n\nSorry if this was all a bit incoherent. Please take care.\n\nTL:DR : \"it's not all about you\" is often used to shame someone for expressing a normal feeling/thing and can be long-term indicate lack of empathy and systemic invalidation", "My situation is both similar and different from yours.\n\nA few things:\n\nI'm also dark skinned (M). My wife is European. I usually wear darker clothes but she got me to appreciate wearing lighter colors for the contrast.\n\nWe also dated for a few months before I realized that she was the one and proposed.\n\nMy wife had originally planned on wearing red and asked that I dress in light colors. I found a suit I liked and she actually came upon a white dress that caught her by surprise. No biggie.\n\nWe never fussed about the wedding. We just wanted a fun time with our friends and close family. \n\nSome friends and family members tried bringing in drama with high expectations (they wanted to be treated to the typical big wedding stuff). \n\nBut my wife and I did didn't want that. So we didn't do that.\n\nAnyway, we never once fought about the wedding with each other. We were on the same page. \n\nWhen we do fight, we never kick the other person out of our home. One person might *volunteer* to sleep on the couch for a night, but that's never asked of them. \n\nThat said, ponder on this situation you're in. This person is making you sleep in your car over clothing choices. Yeah, it's a wedding, but it's also *your* wedding.\n\nIf they aren't showing you kindness in conflict, get out. Even if my wife and I disagree with each other over things, we are *never* mean to each other. We have never raised our voices to one another.\n\nSomeone can disagree with you and handle that disagreement with maturity and civility. For spouses (ie, a life partner) this is especially important.", "It's both your day, and it's not that unusual for the groom to wear white.", "So generally the wedding is more perceived as the brides day i think, even though officially its the day of both.\n\nSo in a modern world you should be able to wear what color you want to your own wedding.\n\nBut you are also marrying your wife and you should probably know what your wife would think about that. I would definitely talk with her before consider a \"exotic\" color suit. Did you not know that wearing white for anyone but the bride is frowned upon? If you did not know, tell her, say sorry and discuss your suit color preferences with her and NTA. However if you did know about white being a very tricky color on weddings and still did not consider to discuss with your girlfriend, then likely YTA, because you really should have anticipated how she might not be happy. \n\nIf there were equality in all aspects between men and women, this topic would not be an issue. But at a wedding the bride gets to decide so you probably have to live with that. \n\nHowever getting kicked out so she can cool off..  Im sorry for you man. \n\nUnless you dont mind dont let that happen maybe.. but that is much easier said than done.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. Look you need to sit down with her and figure out what she would like that would work for both of you. But her reaction is very over the top. \n\nDo you tend to make everything about you? Or did she just say that because she knew it would hurt you and get you to feel guilty? \n\nI don't know if the two of you are ready to be married yet. The fact that you make sure she is safe and don't yell back when she's yelling at you with awesome, but just take a step back and ask if this is how you want your relationship to be. People always say it's just stress from the wedding that made a person act out, but that is a good indicator for how they act under stress. And life will continue to be stressful.", "Nta - the wedding isn\u2019t just about the bride and I\u2019ve heard of many grooms who also wore white.", "Hard NTA! Your wedding day is about both of you\u2026 as a couple\u2026.to be celebrated. I guess I can see how some women feel like white is strictly bridal territory, but even if that\u2019s her opinion- being mad before she even spoke to you about it? That doesn\u2019t sit right. Don\u2019t absorb this guilt. Think hard about this marriage and if this is the person you would trust with your life if necessary.", "NTA. Whew! She came unhinged! My late husband had a white tux for his first wedding. He looked handsome. His first wife also wore white. LOTS of grooms have done it (though not super trendy recently). My point is, I think you need to step back from this wedding. Something is WAY OFF.", "Wow, this escalated quickly. There is nothing saying you can\u2019t wear a non-traditional suit or even a white suit and you\u2019re not an asshole for wanting to, but something non-traditional for either party might best be coordinated with your partner. \n\nRegardless, her reaction was uncalled for and extreme. I\u2019ve got to think there are festering issues in your relationship, and clearly with you personally. You\u2019ve been told you are selfish and self-centered, but your solution has been to refuse any celebration of you and she has been okay with that? She is also okay with you sleeping in a car? She should care more about your wellbeing. And, you both should have better communication skills. \n\nNTA based on wanting to wear white, but I would seriously consider not marrying this woman and investing in therapy for yourself.", "NTA, there are TWO people getting married here :/\n\nThe day isn't all about you, it's not all about her either, it's about both of you.", "NTA. I hate the whole \"it's her special day\" talk about brides when it's supposed to be a celebration for *both* of you. She sounds toxic AF. I would seriously reconsider marrying this woman, or at least waiting and getting some counseling first. Plus she's directing you to include her brother and then he basically tattled on you? Just no.", "It should be an OUR day situation and equally about both of you. You should BOTH wear what makes you most comfortable, shine, feel the best about yourself etc. White tuxes exist for a reason (and they were very popular for grooms in the 80s and 90s). If my partner wanted to rock a white floral suit I\u2019d be looking for a dress that would compliment it. You shouldn\u2019t be focused on settling down before you\u2019re too old but finding the person that supports and compliments you too. If your wedding can\u2019t be about you at all, perhaps you need to rethink this relationship. \n\nAlso- my husband wore a white tux.", "Y\u2019all got issues. \n\nScreaming?\n\u201cAll about you?\u201d\nTalking behind each others back? \nSleeping in your car? \n\nESH. Clothes are the least of your problems.", "NTA for wanting to wear something that sounds like a great fit.   \n\n\nBut YTA to yourself if you stay in this relationship. It sounds like you and your fianc\u00e9 have wildly different ideas about who each of you are as people. It also sounds like you can\u2019t argue in a healthy way. This relationship isn\u2019t going to be fun or easy, and how is she \u2018the one\u2019 if she and you get into screaming matches that leave you living in the car.", "NTA. It's not her special day; it's **both** of your special day. Also, I wouldn't sleep in your car. It's your home too. Is this really the woman you want to marry? She doesn't seem very loving or considerate of you.", "NTA, I think? I mean, if it\u2019s just about the suit. Men wearing white/cream at weddings isn\u2019t new. I just went to one and everyone looked great, including the bride who was fully in white. You\u2019re just contradicting her vision. But the problem with a dream wedding is at some point, another human who doesn\u2019t live in your head is involved. My mom hated the tuxes my dad picked. They\u2019ve been married 47 years lol. That said, let people celebrate your birthday. It\u2019s actually not all about you if it makes someone happy to do something for you. So either you were a little shit in your past, or someone planted this seed in your head. Either way, let it go.", "What the teetotal F*CK did I just read?\n\nMy man, you have dodged a bullet. Get your sh*t as quickly as possible and run hard in a fast direction away from this crazy person. \n\nYou sound like a great guy and can do so much better.", "So Whitney Houston WAS right :\n\nIt's all white\nBut it's okay\nI'm gonna make it anyway\nPack your bags up and leave\nDon't you dare come running back to me\nIt's all white\nBut it's okay", "Dude. Don\u2019t get married to someone you\u2019ve only known for 1.5 years. Such a bad idea. How a person acts during wedding planning is a direct reflection of how your life is going to be with that person. \n\nShe has you sleeping in your car? For what? She hasn\u2019t even bothered ASKING you what you\u2019re thinking or feeling. She just decided to go nuclear because apparently it\u2019s \u201cher\u201d day not \u201cboth your\u201d day. \n\nFuck that noise dude. \n\nSide note: expecting a birthday present and celebration does NOT make you selfish or self centered.", "I'm leaning nta, but I dunno man, having others tell you growing up that you had these issues, I'm wondering what your wife's perspective is. \n\nHer tantrum though does sound really bad as well...kicking you out for this feels VERY wrong, but I just feel we're not hearing everything.", "I don\u2019t know if OP needs to run, but it doesn\u2019t sound like they are ready to be married.", "I may be at fault for making it go so fast due to just being in love and finding her very beautiful, we knew each other for about a year before we started dating due to a mutual friend. I proposed after hearing her saying she wants to spend the rest of her life with me but maybe my judgement was unclear.  \n\n\nIn her defense also, she's not making me sleep in my car, she just said she didn't want to see me right now and said that if I don't leave, she'll leave and I don't want to put her in a unsafe environment due to driving late at night or even putting her out of our apartment. I just don't want to ask my friends to spend a couple days at their house so I decided to just sleep in my car, I still come home to shower and do some things while she's out or at work but I don't spend a lot of time there and don't go inside if I notice her car is still there.", "Time to bail out of this relationship. This is a preview of your future if you get married.", "Like I've said a comment before, it's not a huge wedding and I have went NC with all my family long ago, she said her brothers and a couple uncles should be my groomsmen to balance it out, it would be weird to have no one on my side and like 4-5 people on hers.", "Exactly this. It is about two people and their love for each other...not about the bride and her \"vision.\" \n\nBuy the suit. Ditch the fiancee. NTA", "I do agree I should have asked her before I went to the store to look at suits, I do want to clarify that I didn't actually buy the suit and was going to ask her about her opinion on which one I should buy. I was always under the impression that weddings were based around the bride since people mostly only talk about the bride or what bride looked or what the bride did. I never thought about it like truly.", "I totally get that and I do think it would be nice to get both sides but the last thing I want to do is make this even worse by telling her that I posted this online. Although tonight, you all have me thinking over my own mistakes with even being in this relationship but I'm still stuck. I wanted to type more but Reddit only allows you to post so many characters, I'm willing to answer any questions you or anyone else have as long as they're not too personal.", "I have been thinking that the attention will be mostly on her regardless, I have a couple of friends coming but most of the people are her friends and family, again it's not a huge wedding with like 200+ people, it's only less then 50 people coming. I just didn't want to draw attention to myself because I wanted her to shine, especially since her friends and family will be there.  \n\n\nI figured it'll be just like any other groom, since it seems like most people don't care much about the groom or how he looks or anything of the sort. Even in my first draft before shortening things, I was mentioning how grooms usually look basic and very similar to the groomsmen most of the time so even with a different colored suit, I didn't think too much about it but I decided that I should have just bought a normal black tux regardless but wanted to ask her what to wear anyway.", "I do want to say I didn't buy the suit yet, nearly saw some online and wanted to see some in person to see if I even wanted to buy it. I still haven't bought the suit let alone any suit yet. I planned on asking her opinion on a couple choices I was looking at since I wanted to make her feel okay with how I looked since I didn't want to upstage her or make her not feel special, I wanted to make this day the best day of her life, even at my own discomfort. If she wanted me to show up in my boxers, I would have done it, I would do anything for her but over the past couple minutes, I'm starting to get a different outlook on a lot of things regarding this.", "I'm surprisingly sharing a lot more here then I ever have before but I'll just say this since this is a throwaway, I have been to therapy before and more times the not, have had bad times with it or made certain things worst that I've talked about or tried to get help for. I sometimes talk to people about things but right now, at this moment, this seems so little compared to what other people, my friends included have to go through.", "I only was looking at a white suit and only thought of buying it but probably could have never went through with it, I was going to just let her choose what I wore because it was about her although some people on Reddit say otherwise, I'm not sure myself if it's my opinion or not anymore. I personally don't know much about actual weddings and thought the grooms always wore a black tux and nothing more. I learned about grooms wearing more then that such as blue, gold and also white, I figured it wasn't a huge deal but was going to let her choose whatever I wore since like I said, I wanted to make it all about her", "The \"refuse any celebration of me\" may have sound off but I meant I don't like birthdays of myself or receiving gifts on Christmas and the like. I have received gifts from her but I end up buying her something back because I feel bad, even on my own birthday.  \n\n\n But as I've said to a couple other comments, I only came to this decision to maybe wear a white suit over the course of three days, I didn't buy the suit nor plan on buying it that day, only to look at everything and see my opinions before asking her what she would like me to wear but maybe I should have asked her from day one what she would have liked me to wear, perhaps this wouldn't all have happened.", "It sounds like he grew up with abusive people and so he doesn\u2019t have a good instinct for love bombing and abusive behaviors.", "I do want to clarify a bit the only people who would tell me this is my egg donor and egg donor's mother. Not to get too personal, they were both very strict and overbearing  parents and caused a lot of issues for me and is the main reason why I have no family coming to the wedding. Not a excuse for anything I did do wrong as a child but still, I didn't put this in due to not having enough characters to write it all out, I'm sorry for any misunderstanding on my part.", "Get out of this relationship now.  WTF, she acts like this over what you want to wear to your wedding.  It will only go downhill from here on out.", "Dude, if they're truly your friends, they'd be horrified that you're so worried about being seen as selfish or an imposition that you can't turn to them. You sound like you have incredibly bad self esteem, starting from your upbringing, which has trained you to give way and appease.\n\nLet me tell you something. A real life partner will *lift* you up, will stand in your corner and fight for you. Proudly show you off, not shriek that they are the only one that gets attention.", "Oh, honey. Your groomspeople should be the ones you want to have stand behind you, literally and metaphorically, while you commit yourself to your spouse. They should be *your* people, whatever that means to you, and they can be friends if you don't want family. They should not be chosen by your spouse-to-be, even if she's well-intentioned.\n\nLook, it's a faux pas for *guests* to wear white to someone else's wedding in cultures where white has become a tradition. It is not a faux pas for the *groom* to because for the groom, it's not \"someone else's wedding\"! But your fiancee seems to think it's *her* wedding only, or at least that's how she's asking.\n\nThat is no way to start a lifetime partnership.", "Frankly, I agree. The brides tend to get the focus anyway, which is why I think it's worrying that she won't let you have even this thing that's important to you. Are there other aspects of the wedding that you guys have found yourselves at loggerheads for?", "Honestly, all of this is not ok. It\u2019s not just her day, it\u2019s YOUR day - you both should feel special. I don\u2019t know what happened to you in your past but you are really lacking in self worth. Please know you are worth it. Find someone who knows that too", "Ok then NTA. Take care of yourself and stay safe.", "Thank you so much for your kind words and encouragement, I just do not want to have a repeat of some high school friends of mine who did see me coming to them for help or support as a bad thing and just said I was looking for pity and attention, I'm no longer friends with those people but I rather not open the door for something like that to happen, considering what happened right now, I still think I should have just let her pick out my suit from day one."]}
