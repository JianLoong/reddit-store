My dad remarried my stepmom Layla when I was seven and they later had my half-sister Lily (12f.) Lily has been diagnosed with IED. Any little thing can make her explode. I honestly don\u2019t feel safe around her because of the things that she has done when angry and I moved out at 18 because of her. Lily goes to counseling twice a week and takes Prozac but it doesn\u2019t really help.\n\nLayla died two years ago, and my dad recently died as well. He always had health issues, but his health truly began to decline after a workplace accident last year. Since she doesn\u2019t work, my aunt has been staying with Lily at Dad and Layla\u2019s house, but she isn\u2019t able to stay and will need to return to her own family out of the state soon. Both my dad\u2019s side of the family and Layla\u2019s parents all live either across or out of the state. They agree that they are willing to take in Lily, but are begging me to become her guardian/caretaker so that she isn\u2019t forced to leave her friends, school, and previous life behind after just losing her mom and dad.\n\nI have told them all that I\u2019m sorry, but no, I am not going to take in Lily and become her new guardian. I cannot handle her. I cannot meet her needs. I don\u2019t even know how to coordinate the services that Lily needs. I would have to drop out of school and likely find a different job to live close enough. I\u2019m not going to give up my life for Lily and I shouldn\u2019t have to, no matter how much I love Layla and my dad.\n\nMy aunt, uncle, and Layla\u2019s parents told me I was a cold and callous person and sister. And accused me of not caring that I have denied Lily the chance to keep some part of her old life after her parents have died so young. I know firsthand how much losing your parents young hurts. And I have nothing but sympathy for Lily to have to go through that as a child.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I cannot handle her. Leaving her school and friends behind will be hard but she will not go into the system. Lily has family members who are willing to take her in and are better equipped to handle her condition than I am. But my aunt, uncle, and Layla\u2019s parents say that I lack any true empathy for my sister and that while my dad and Layla didn't have a choice, I chose to leave Lily young as well.
