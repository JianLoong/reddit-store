My dad remarried my stepmom Layla when I was seven and they later had my half-sister Lily (12f.) Lily has been diagnosed with IED. Any little thing can make her explode.

Lily goes to counseling twice a week and takes Prozac but it doesn\u2019t really help.\n\nLayla died two years ago, and my dad recently died as well. He always had health issues, but his health truly began to decline after a workplace accident last year. Since she doesn\u2019t work, my aunt has been staying with Lily at Dad and Layla\u2019s house, but she isn\u2019t able to stay and will need to return to her own family out of the state soon. Both my dad\u2019s side of the family and Layla\u2019s parents all live either across or out of the state. They agree that they are willing to take in Lily, but are begging me to become her guardian/caretaker so that she isn\u2019t forced to leave her friends, school, and previous life behind after just losing her mom and dad.\n\nI have told them all that I\u2019m sorry, but no, I am not going to take in Lily and become her new guardian. I cannot handle her. I cannot meet her needs. I don\u2019t even know how to coordinate the services that Lily needs. I would have to drop out of school and likely find a different job to live close enough.

And accused me of not caring that I have denied Lily the chance to keep some part of her old life after her parents have died so young. I know firsthand how much losing your parents young hurts. And I have nothing but sympathy for Lily to have to go through that as a child.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I cannot handle her. Leaving her school and friends behind will be hard but she will not go into the system. Lily has family members who are willing to take her in and are better equipped to handle her condition than I am. But my aunt, uncle, and Layla\u2019s parents say that I lack any true empathy for my sister and that while my dad and Layla didn't have a choice, I chose to leave Lily young as well.

Moving across country would be less bad for her than being responsible for her would be for you. That should matter to your family, if it doesn't you can disregard their opinions on literally everything else.", "NTA OP. I'm reading \"The Gift of Fear\" right now, and the author would tell you to listen to that intuition that makes you feel safe around her.", "NTA\n\nyou lost your parents very young too", "NTA.  An older person with more life and hopefully some parenting experience should be taking care of this challenging child, not a 22 year old who doesn't feel prepared or able to do so.  It sounds like there are plenty of relatives willing and capable of taking care of Lily -- let them do so,  It will be better both for her and for you.", "NTA. You're *22.* You're not that far out of childhood yourself, I don't know if many 22 year olds are particularly equipped to care for a 12 year old in the best of circumstances. I certainly wouldn't have been. And these are far from the best of circumstances, she's an unstable 12 year old who's just been through some traumatic events. You looking after her wouldn't be the best thing for her, let alone for you. And you shouldn't have to set yourself on fire to keep her warm.", "You know exactly what you can and cannot do, and your family is trying to force you to live beyond the boundaries you are comfortable with and capable of handling, all for the sake of someone they could probably take care of themselves if they truly cared as much as they seem to let on.  \n\n\nNTA, OP. And do remind them for me that pressing people like this is how relatives end up committed to nursing homes early with zero contact from their younger family.", "NTA you do not feel safe ith your half sister. That ALONE is cause to not take her in. And at 22, your family is asking you to give up your future to raise a pre-teen.", "Nta", "NTA you\u2019re 22 you need to stay focus on your future. Your sister has way too many problems that you\u2019re not equipped to deal with. Again you\u2019re only 22!", "This is honestly what I was thinking. Lay on the guilt so they don't have to work out how to handle the kid with explosive anger problems. The whole situation sucks for Lily regardless, but OP can have empathy and also be self aware enough to know they can't handle it, especially if they previously have ingrained trauma responses from living with her.", "NTA. They want a human sacrifice. You BET they would judge you whether you do it or not. Make your own best life.", "What in the world did I just read!?!?\n\nYou are 22. You just lost your dad. 22 is very young to lose a parent too especially since you had already lost your mom. I can\u2019t believe how heartless and cruel everyone is being towards you. \n\nEven if she was the sweetest, gentlest child that helps you do chores and tells you that she loves you, you still don\u2019t have to become her guardian. If you can\u2019t be a parent, don\u2019t. A life is too precious to mess around with and you are very mature to know that. \n\nNta. And I am so sorry for your losses.", "Clear NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDropping out of school? This is ridiculous. Do not let them guilt you.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Don\u2019t listen to them - you know you can\u2019t handle her, so taking her would destroy your life and wouldn\u2019t benefit her. I question whether these relatives are actually willing to take her or just want the credit of saying they are. That kind of behavior disorder is VERY hard to live with. Even if they fail to follow through, don\u2019t relent. Maybe she would actually get treatment if she was a ward of the state.", "NTA. From what you've said taking guardianship would be the wrong decision for both of you.", "NTA. \n\nYou can have empathy for someone without being required to make a decision that benefits them and injures you. Empathy is a tool, not a rule. And doing what's best for you now, may end up benefiting everyone the most in the future.", "NTA - no one should be pressuring you to take on that responsibility, at 22 I would encourage you not to. If you have family that is setup to help her properly but she needs to move that is far better. You need freedom and aren't at that stage of life, she needs stability", "NTA\nHow are you supposed to support Lily and yourself if you leave school? It's really not about living your life to the fullest, it's about long term planing and quality of life for both of you which would be much worse without proper education (for you)\nAnyone that expect you to quit school is AH.\n\nLet her stay with other willing relatives, even if it means moving to different state. You can always help: send money, visit, or regular phone calls to check on them.", "NTA you are not her parent. They seem to be just trying to guilt you into taking responsibility so they don\u2019t have to. Stick to your decision. They will get over it  Or they won\u2019t. Those are their opinions. \nGood for you for knowing what you can and cannot do. Best of luck", "NTA. They\u2019re not asking you to feed their birds for a weekend. They\u2019re asking you to completely uproot and change your life to be a caregiver for a special needs child. One that you already know you can\u2019t handle. Don\u2019t let them guilt you into this. It won\u2019t be good for anybody. Except them who won\u2019t have to take on the responsibility themselves.", "NTA. They have reservations about taking her in as well, that's why they are trying to make you feel like an AH.", "NTA. You are 22, you are not well equipped to handle parenting a 12-year-old with significant needs. It might be a different situation if she had absolutely no other option but foster care, but she has other family members who are willing to step in. Stay in touch with Lily and be her sister; don't try to be her parent.", "NTA. My guess is none of these people want to take in Lily either. They're probably coming down hard on you because of their own guilt and annoyance that you're making them have to face some hard truths about themselves.", ">these issues\n\nOkay first I find it hilarious the conditions acronym is IED. And second, for some reason my brain was thinking it was some sort of heart condition (I have heart issues so ig I was in that mindset??) where her heart could explode and then I had to stop confused why OP was so unsafe around an exploding heart. \n\nBut I totally agree OP isn't qualified to take her in. The resentment will not be beneficial to Lily, let alone OP.", "They don\u2019t care. They just want a warm body to take care of Lily because they truly don\u2019t want to be bothered.\n\nThey are also conveniently ignoring all of the issues, including the fact that she would have to give up her education and her future, she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to do this without a full-time job, nowhere is it mentioned how she would be supported or what the family would be willing to do to facilitate this by coming in and taking turns, and they are obviously ignoring all of the medical issues and coordination required.\n\nThank goodness that OP is levelheaded. Otherwise she might\u2019ve gotten roped into this and ruined her 20s and possibly the rest of her life to accommodate people truly lacking an empathy who are typically saying \u201csomeone else should do it.\u201d NTA", "Empathy!"]}
