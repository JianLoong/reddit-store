While it\u2019s within OP\u2019s rights to request a warrant, she also doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nIf they were there for a more serious offence, then yes, she should\u2019ve asked for a warrant and contacted a lawyer. But he was accused of shoplifting or petty theft, not murder.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a Hollywood blockbuster, where OP\u2019s stepson ends up being framed for murder or international drug smuggling. This is a very mundane and routine case for police.", "I never stole anything as a kid or even considered it, but my father still gave me the \"never talk to the police without a lawyer\" talk.  Hell, he gave my friends the same talk, and they were just as bookish as I was.", "They said \"if\". That is just steelmanning it.", "Lmao I am a younger millennial (z-lennial?) and our experiences are complete opposites lol. I didn't even know millennials actually had DARE the program in schools. Everyone I grew up with knew it as that thing that is associated with weird overprotective mom and Nancy Reagan energies and a logo on tshirts worn for sports practice or when it was 80's themed dress up days. Usually ironic or you were trying to be retro or it was just w highlighter like shade that was fun. I don't think I know anyone that remembers where those shirts came from, one of those items that just appears in your wardrobe !", "Oh, you paid attention during those?  I zoned out.

I think I heard that the program ended up doing more harm than good, but it's 1:30 in the morning and I'm not in a \"looking up statistics\" sort of mood right now.\n\nI guess the program did its job with me though: I am so completely paranoid around any sort of party or social gathering where there is even a whiff of pot smoke or anything like that.

It was dropped because it was nothing but a cop being pissy. I asked to get my medication from my car. The officer (not the pissy one) responded, \"Sure, we'll take a look around your car.\" When I declined, the officer asked if there was a reason. I asked if he had kids . He said yes.  I told him my Dad was retired LEO and asked him what he'd taught his kids about warrants and being searched. He smirked and told me my Dad was a smart man.

He knows op didn't even ask a single question or find out any information, just let the cops in, accept it's stolen and jay is at fault, screams at him, and let's him be arrested not even bothering to head over to the station with them. \n\nIn what world would any reasonable or rational person be thinking let me ask the person that literally knows the least and didn't bother to even ask for the tiniest piece of information or a warrant or any detail whatsoever and just allowed your minor son to be arrested and dragged from his home - \"what happened\" or \"what did Jay do\".\n\nHe and Jay have already spoken. He was at the station likely spoke with the cops. He was back home in a couple of hours so sounds like it was actually custodial interrogation not even an actual arrest actually. Of course jay's dad responded like this. And if there is no basis for the arrest or custody then his reaction seems totally in line with the situation. If the whole thing was nothing and op basically let the cops do whatever they wanted without any care about what was actually going on - yeah my first question would be why the fuck did you let them in the house and not call me or his other guardian before allowing my minor son to be questioned by the police and arrested ? \n\nIf Jay didn't even do anything wrong and op's first response was that line about she was taught better than covering for a criminal - I would be yeeting op the fuck out of my life so fast it would give you whiplash.", "OP doesn't have the authority to exercise her stepson's rights or not, that belongs to him and his parents. It wasn't her choice to make. \n\nAnd no, failing to demand a warrant or talk to an attorney is not reasonable at all, regardless of the reason you were arrested.
