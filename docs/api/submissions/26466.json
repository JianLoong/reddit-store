He needs help bringing his head back above water so he can see and think rationally. Are there terrible things happening, yes. Is it all some global elite cabal thing? No. I\u2019m sorry you are dealing with this. But I would look up ways to help loved ones come back from conspiracy theories. Maybe find ways for him to get information about the world that\u2019s not from grifters on TikTok. That type of propaganda is powerful", "NTA.  No way could I live with a doom-and-gloomer.

But there is a lot of danger in conspiracy theories.  Of course, 99% of them are not true. They often appeal to insecurity and fear. I remember watching American History X for the first time when I was young. Ed Norton, a skinhead, goes to prison for a hate crime against a black man. Then the neo nazis beat him up in prison and his best friend is a black dude. It is a really powerful movie about people being seduced by false narratives. Nortons character struggles financially and uses racist ideology to justify that the system is against him. During COVID times I think the obsession with hydroxychloroquine was fueled by people who felt they just had no control over it. Believing in conspiracies helps to soothe a worried mind regarding all the myriad of issues in the world that are chaotic and without reason. It helps people to make sense of the unreason of it all. Embracing uncertainty and living with courage is the best path.", "NTA  He's been programmed.", "Are we married to the same person? Lol.
