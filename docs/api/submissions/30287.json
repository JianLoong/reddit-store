I have two more sisters (29/F and 34/F), I am the last one to live at home, with our mom. She also has metastases on her liver, spleen, kidneys and pancreas and is about to start chemo next week. So it is pretty safe to say that she will not live until my birthday, coming up in late February.\n\nI have clarify that my sisters and me, all together experienced various kinds of abuse from our mother. This has led to me, not even liking my mother. I know this makes me sound like a bad person, but I gotta be honest, I really don't care about her being sick or passing away in the near future - which might be an important info for the rest of the story.\n\nYesterday one of my sisters and I went through all documents my mom has, mostly paid attention to bills, account statements and all the financial stuff. Not only did we find bills were we have no idea were they came from, insanely high amounts of insurance payments (about 1.200\u20ac just for her car every single year) and her bank account being in a minus of four figures, she also took out a loan of 50.000\u20ac. We have no idea why she did that.\n\nSo now we have my sister, who struggles with money anyway, my other sister who's currently building a house and has two small kids and me. A 19 year old student nurse, who is currently getting her license, lives with our mom (when she's not in the hospital) and has absolutely no money until I start working in December after I pass my exam. Now my sisters expect me to inherit all our mother's debt (which is now roughly around 36.000\u20ac), just so I can also inherit her car. I can not get just the car, I have to take the car and the debt. And in all honesty, I do not see a reason in being 19 years old, about to enter the job market and having debt in 5 figures, which are not even my fault. My creditworthiness means a lot to me as well. Maybe it's because I don't like her so I don't have this feeling of \"I would do anything for my family\" or it's just my future bank account screaming at me to not inherit her entire debt.\n\nAnd now I sit her, eating breakfast, wondering, AITA?", "created_utc": 1699093271, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17nip75/aita_for_not_wanting_to_inherit_my_mothers_debt/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I think in a lot of European countries it's possible to refuse an inheritance. \n\nTbh, I feel that your sisters are trying to scam you.  If I was in your position I would refuse the car, let the loan company repossess it.\n\nYour instincts are correct, don't take on the debt.  And check your own credit report.

You would be stupid to take on that amount of debt for an assets that in most cases is short lived (compared to a house or smth) and decreases in value kinda fast. The car will be gone in the next 5-7 years, the debt will not. Also a car is not something that usually has a lot sentimental value, so this seems to me like some bizarre weird stupid situation that I don't understand at all. Even if your mom was your favorite person in all world, how is inheriting crushing debt and a short lived random low sentimental value asset helping anything? Unless the car is an old fancy car in high demand with value going up each year, this would be a really really stupid move.", "NTA in my opinion, but I don't understand one thing.

Maybe we\u2019re in different countries with different rules? \n\nNTA - sorry you\u2019re going through this. Sometimes we have to mourn a relationship and not just a person. It\u2019s a weird place to be. \n\nGood luck to you", "It probably depends on the country you live in, because I didn\u2019t know you could inherit debt. \n\nI mean, it\u2019s possible, but in most circumstances, a 19 year old isn\u2019t a co-borrower on a loan (e.g. you and your mom didn\u2019t take out a mortgage together), and you\u2019re too young (and poor) to be a guarantor of someone else\u2019s loan application.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019d personally wait and see what assets can be sold, and how much of the debt can be paid off. The car should be sold to pay off the debt. You shouldn\u2019t inherit the car.  It\u2019s a weird system.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know where you live but in the U.S., all debts of the deceased go against the deceased\u2019s estate, meaning their assets. The heirs don\u2019t assume the debts personally.

Speak with a lawyer, there is the chance to not inherit someone's debt.", "Is the car worth over 36,000 euros? Assuming not, there's no way I'd take the debt on - because the price of \"inheriting\" the car, is assuming the 36k debt. So refuse it. If you wouldn't pay 36k for that car in store, then don't pay it from a familyn member.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it is up to them to decide. Neither is up to you. Bring this to a lawyer. I think the debt must be split between all of you equally after you have liquified the assets you can. Sell everything and pay the debt. If that means you have to sell the house, do that and go renting.", "Uuuum. Children do not \"inherit\" debt in the US. The estate inherits debt. If there is no estate because the person owned no assets and lived in poverty then the debt dies with them. It is never transferred to their children. \n\nThat means everything she owns comes off the top before anyone gets an inheritance. \n\nThat means....if she owns a house or any money....her debts get paid FIRST before there is anything left over to split between siblings. Sounds to me like your siblings either don't know how the laws works or don't want to pay the debt out of the estate so there will be more cash left for them.
