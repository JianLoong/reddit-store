My set schedule is M-F 8a-4p but typically I'm at work from 6a-7p a lot of nights because I'm a manager and we deal with a lot of call outs. It's a very physically demanding job, as we have to move steel lifts by hand (150+ lbs). I also have to do grocery runs nearly every night and laundry on my days off because we don't have a washer/dryer hookup in the apartment. \n\nMy wife homeschools my 3 step kids right now (14m, 13f, 9m) but only until the school system puts plans in place for online schooling in the event of school call offs due to COVID. This decision was made because since school started, 3 weeks and 5 days of it have been called off due to COVID outbreaks, during which time the school hasn't done any schooling (not even online). The kids were falling behind so she opted to just homeschool until the school figures it out. We also have a 7 week old daughter that is strictly breastfed and requires a lot of my wife's time/energy. So, we are both really busy and drained. \n\nYesterday work was one of the worst days by far. I came home with bruises and blisters on my hands, legs and stomach (4 call outs so it was only me and one other employee- who is an 18yo that doesn't do much outside of check tiktok). I was in a good amount of discomfort and just wanted to relax. I took the baby when I got home (after grocery shopping) and went to sit in front of the TV. My wife got dinner prepared+dished out. I hand the baby back to her because it's feeding time and then I eat dinner. My wife gets the baby to sleep and then starts cleaning the dishes. Well, I forgot my lunch pail in the truck and asked my wife to grab it for me and she completely spiraled. She's like \"are you going to get off your ass and do absolutely anything tonight or do you just expect me to be the maid? Want me to wipe you ass while I'm at it?\" I asked what she was on about and she said \"I homeschooled all day with a baby attached to my breast, did the dishes just to make dinner that I didn't get to eat and then washed the dishes again, just to have to put the baby down and now you're asking me to do more even though you are doing jack shit.\" I just said whatever and dismissed it because it's not worth the fight but today I texted her and asked what she was doing and she said \"everything, per usual\" so apparently she's still on her tangent. I don't ask for much but last night I wasn't willing to do anything. AITA?\n\nETA: I didn't see it as a big deal because she was going outside anyways to water her plants.", "created_utc": 1700147662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wp95a/aita_for_asking_my_wife_to_do_favors_for_me_after/", "score": 1872, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You give a lot of detail about how tough your job is, but from her point of view you came home and sat in front of the TV, letting her do everything for you while you \"held the baby\".You also slip in between two lines that \\*the baby is a newborn\\* like it doesn't maker her obvious exhaustion all that worse, lmao.

You didn\u2019t take turns with the baby so you could both eat? You got groceries after work but didn\u2019t help cook? Then after all that, and she still didn\u2019t have a chance to eat dinner, you don\u2019t even offer to help clean the dishes.

She was washing up already and has just had a baby. You're tired yes but doesn't mean you can ask her to run and fetch for you. Also you don't need to be doing food shopping every day? Not having a washing machine also seems like something to prioritise cos this situation seems untenable.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your wife is barley holding her head above water all day, every day, while you're at work. She's got a baby attached to her nearly all day long while she's got three other kids to take care of. \n\nSomething needs to give. You have two teenagers in the house, what do they do to help out?

And homeschooling. Your wife is basically doing a job of two-three people. In no way does this mean you\u2019re not doing a lot.

You want your wife to wait on you when you get home because you had a hard day and routinely go beyond your set hours, all because the person you supervise who is supposed to be doing the job WITH you spends the day on TikTok? Let\u2019s identify the source of the problem here. Oh - it\u2019s the kid you supervise who isn\u2019t doing his job.

If what you posted is true about what she does during the day, then she works much harder than you do \"as a manager\".\n\nAlso, your schedule is \"NOT SET\" if you are working more hours than what your first posted.  You're just avoiding the work at home.", "YTA wife is spending her days teaching 3 kids, cooking, cleaning and breastfeeding a newborn.  I also assume she has to spend nights also feeding and caring for the new baby.  If your contribution to the household chores is holding the baby, stopping at a store and doing laundry.  My husband also has a physical job.  She just grew and birthed a human being, her body has been through something major.  You didn\u2019t care she didn\u2019t eat.  That\u2019s your baby too.  Don\u2019t you want to make sure she is nourished so that your child can also be nourished? If your apartment is in a high rise, that would make you even more an AH.  Even if your vehicle is right outside the door, get off your butt and grab your own lunchbox or get up 10 min early and go get it yourself.  Unless you expected her to get it and also wash out the contents.  Ugh.", "YTA taking care of and breastfeeding a newborn is exhausting, and she has 3 kids to homeschool who  don\u2019t want to be home; two probably moody teens.

That\u2019s a full time job and then more. \n\nYou carry the emotional load of your job but she carries everything else, all day. \n\nAnd you dismissed her feelings when she showed her frustration. Everyone is drained and exhausted. It\u2019s not a competition about who has has the worst day, be a team and acknowledge she has the right to be tired\u2026. And to sit down and eat a meal.", "why didn't you ask one of the older children?", "YTA. I mean your wife didn't even get to eat her dinner. Why couldn't you have run out to your vehicle to get your lunch pail? Or do the dishes? By the sounds of it, while your job is hard it actually ends, and you are paid for it, and you get breaks. Your wife's job does not end, is unpaid, and she probably does not get that many breaks.", "i dont even have to read the whole post to say YTA  SHE SHOULD BE RECOVERING as she just gave birth 7 weeks ago! come on dude, seriously? step up a bit!", "YTA. Get your own pail.", "NTA. She was heading outside to water the plants so it wasn\u2019t an unreasonable ask. \n\nBut also you bust your ass working a physically demanding job Monday-Friday to take care of your family that includes 3 kids that are not yours. Where is the father of these kids? Anyone calling you lazy is absolutely ridiculous.", "YTA. She\u2019s working much harder than you - when\u2019s it her turn to sit around on the sofa?

That\u2019s very inefficient use of your time, seeing as you\u2019re both slammed.\n\nI could see her being annoyed that you just decide to relax after your long day and not help.  She doesn\u2019t get to do that.  As she said, she hadn\u2019t even eaten yet, and served you before serving herself. For her, it\u2019s work and sleep, no personal downtime.  She can\u2019t even sit in front of the tv. She\u2019s probably burning out.  You need to talk to her about how she\u2019s coping with this load day to day.

I get it you\u2019re tired, but as a manager it\u2019s you\u2019re job to manage workload and staff levels.

Or does that only apply when the person posting is a brides-maid or a mother? Because I don't see the mods stopping anyone from straight-up insulting this dude. \n\nPersonally, I think ESH. Could OP be more considerate of their wife? Absolutely. But, the wife could certainly stop acting like their husband isn't working just as hard if not harder than she is every single day.\n\n I always feel like the people who immediately discount physical labor jobs have never had to DO a physical labor job, and so convince themselves that doing laundry or dishes is the equivalent to lifting and moving 150+ lb steel ties for 9 hours a day or lifting and rolling 400lb steel pipe for the same.\n\nI'm sorry, but at the end of the day, the husband here is providing the sole financial support for their family and is doing so via extremely damaging and exhaustive physical labor. The wife is under a lot of stress, yes, but acting like the husband is the only one being inconsiderate of their partners' contributions is simply wrong.\n\nOP, if you're reading this, take some more time to consider what you can do to help around the house. Your wife deserves to eat dinner too. However, you aren't the only one at fault here no matter how angrily the other reddittors here assert you are. Nuance exists, and you are in a shitty situation all around. Just try to be more empathetic to your wife and tell you you want the same for your own work and Contributions.", "YTA\n\nYou got to come home and sit your ass on the couch.

You both have set your life up in such a way where it\u2019s basically impossible to not be stressed out to the max and at the end of your rope and cranky AF.  Having 4 kids in the best of circumstances is stressful.  But sure, let\u2019s throw in some home schooling with a newborn.  And live somewhere without a washer/dryer and dishwasher.  You guys gotta redesign your lives or you\u2019re going to burn out and not have a very peaceful home.", "YTA.", "YTA - she\u2019s homeschooling 3 kids with a 7 week old?

Wtf dude.", "ESH\n\nAnother \u201cwe had too many kids and now life is hard\u201d story. \n\nOf course it\u2019s hard. You have four kids on one income and one adult\u2019s full-time attention. You just gotta suffer through and tighten your shit wherever you can (being more organized at grocery shopping for one, and putting your kids back in school and just supplementing with limited \u201chomeschooling\u201d to catch them up as needed, and surely the older kids can start pulling their weight a little.)", "Yta - do you get paid more money for picking up the slack of others at work? Why are you busting your butt all day at work for zero recognition and zero extra compensation and then giving your wife a hard time and not doing your fair share at home where it actually matters.", "NAH.   Can the homeschooled kids do little things like this?   If not, you have a wife problem.  The hey are old enough to help with chores.  It\u2019s good for them.  They should be helping with after dinner clean up and meal prep.   This will build needed skills for adulting.  And hopefully build responsibility and respect for the work you and your wife do.", "ESH. Both of you are tired, and neither are considering the other. Y\u2019all need to sit down and have a conversation. She sees herself as doing everything because of decisions she made. You see yourself as doing a lot because of your job and grocery shopping everyday. You two need to figure out a plan for what each of you need to do. But I have questions:\n\n1. Why are you grocery shopping every day? Buy enough for the week and only go once. Run to the store in between  when you\u2019ve run out of something, which shouldn\u2019t be everyday. Going every day with that large of a family is nonsensical. By you going this late, you\u2019re delaying getting home.\n\n2. Has your wife tried pumping? It is ok for her to pump and bottle feed. She is choosing to strictly use a form of feeding that makes it hard to do anything until the kid is done eating.\n\n3. Why haven\u2019t y\u2019all gone to the school board about the school not teaching when the schools close down? Did they just completely close down  for almost a year in 2020? Probably not. They have stuff in place. They just lazy and don\u2019t want to switch to virtual learning when they close. It isn\u2019t that hard to transition.\n\n4. Who does the cleaning? If your wife does it, I can see why she\u2019s irritated. The kids should have chores and be doing some of the cleaning, like dishes, water the garden, taking out the trash, sweeping, vacuuming, moping, wiping counters, cleaning mirrors, cleaning toilets, etc. majority of chores needing done around the house can be done by 14, 13, and 8 YOs. For example, the 14 and 13 YOs should have been doing the dishes after dinner, not your wife.\n\nEdit: changed question wording", "Info : why was your wife unable to eat dinner?", "How much of a contribution are the children making? My two could help sort the clean washing and put their toys away from the age of two.\n\nYour stepchildren can do some of the cleaning, tidying, washing up, meal preparation, water the plants, change the baby, etc. Allocate jobs according to age and suitability on a rota.", "You can be sure that sometimes she doesn't want to do anything either, but someone has to do it.", "As a manager, you are failing if you  expect your staff to lift 150lb even as a pair. Surely, you can \"manage\" to buy heavy lifting equipment for health and safety reasons.\n\nThen the work will be done faster, with less damage to you and your staff, you can all get home earlier and in a better mood.  \n\nYou will be able to provide more support to your wife, who has worked at least a 12 hour day by then, frequently multitasking, without meal breaks, without pay, without appreciation.", "YTA, but its okay! I was too! My brother-in-law shared his experience that helped me. When he got home and needed time to relax, his wife just.... stopped. Dinner didn't get made, kids didn't get bathed, clothes for school the next day weren't washed... you get the picture. He inquired and was told \"If you're done with work, I'M done with work.\" Messaged received and things went more smoothly for them once he realized his hard day ended at a certain time, whike hers did not. \n\nYou specifics aside, I hope this helps.

Also... grocery shopping every single day is insane. Make a list for goodness sake. You keep pointing out how you do laundry and grocery shop like you think you should get an award for it lol Your wife is teaching 3 children all at different levels every day, feeding them all of their meals... breakfast, lunch and dinner. Doing all the cleaning from that plus taking care of a new born baby (changing diapers, breast feeding, bathing ect ) I'm going out on a limb here but I would also assume she gets up and feeds/chages the baby every 3 hours all night too so she is also sleep deprived.. do you make your lunches, or does she do that, too? Just get your own lunch box the next time. It's the least you can do. Ya, she's still pissed... I'd be extremely pissed too!!!

That was a choice.

I would suggest asking the 14 and 13 yr old to watch the baby for an hour or two (paid of course) and you and your wife take some time to talk. Go for a walk, get some coffee, etc. come up with a plan and be on the same page, then have a meeting with the kids and talk about expectations. As for school, there is no reason those kids either: A) do work in one of the many online schools in just about every state (assuming US) or B) go back to in person and your wife supplements work during the times the schools might be closed. Also, I would be at the next school board meeting asking what the actual F is up with no online learning during these closures.

Why didn\u2019t you set aside a plate for her to eat after doing the baby? Why, after *she* cleaned up the kitchen and cooked dinner, were *you* not doing the dishes so she could sit and eat? The cook doesn\u2019t clean up! And such a menial task as getting your lunch box from the truck, something you could easily do since she was in the middle of doing the dishes for the *second time that night*. That\u2019s just lazy. Your wife said it right, you are acting like she is the maid. \n\n\nYou have a seven week old infant. As tiring as manual labour is (and I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t work hard as hell) it\u2019s just as mentally and physically difficult as teaching three different aged kids while breastfeeding and doing the housework and recovering from birthing a human.

That was the straw that broke the camels back. She\u2019s feeling unappreciated, overworked and needs to not have more tasks put on her plate instead of the meal she should be eating.

It\u2019s vital that she gets to eat, shower and sleep. \n\n\nYou owe an apology for not noticing how much she was doing, how she didn\u2019t get to eat and then do better. Set aside a plate for her if she can\u2019t eat with you and either wait to eat with her so you share a meal or you handle the kids while she gets a break to eat. Don\u2019t ask her to do something you could easily do yourself when she\u2019s arms deep in the sink. Set up online grocery ordering to cut out a task for yourself (I know how draining doing the shopping is after working a full day), maybe try doing things like casseroles or slow cooked meals so evening meals are easier and take little effort and try to brainstorm together some other life hacks to help you both feel less stressed. Above all, just tell the woman you love her, you respect her and, while you were thoughtless on this occasion, you will try to do better and make sure she at least gets a good meal.\n\nPs.

Tell her how you got hurt ask for medication and or ice. This way she knows your not being lazy just hurt.

Well, that specific one then asking her to do something you can do just scream you seem me as a slave.\n* Have a serious talk with her about her struggles and hardships, ask what you can do to help her.\n* Look into solving the home-schooling issue, seriously this is just a bomb waiting to go off.", "You say you work from 6 to 7???

They\u2019re old enough to cook supper, clean the dishes and give the parents a break. Have groceries delivered. I can see her losing her cool there but I don\u2019t think OP is a complete AH. I honestly think they need to do a chore chart.", "NTA but you two need to sit down and come up with a better system to relieve some pressure.  Both of you have hard jobs. The older kids need to be in school.  Wife can't handle homeschooling with a 7 week old baby.  You need to be in tuned to her needs.  As in making sure she eats and is able to have some alone time.

She probably needs a lot of things. And she probably feels like it\u2019s unnoticed by you. \nYou\u2019re feeling like your pain is going unnoticed too obviously. \n\nA less physically demanding job is an option. \nOr couples counseling. It helps to have a mediator navigate important conversations that are sometimes hard to have at home. People can get heated and defensive. You guys need a safe space to talk out how you both are feeling.", "NTA but i think a quick explanation of 'hey I had a really tough day at work and will need your help tonight' may have helped her prepare so that she doesnt feel dumped on. Make sure to make it up to her.", "NTA. But both of you should definitely have a conversation on household chores and expectations. And also should plan the groceries out better. I buy those staples you mentioned in my weekly run even if they have not run out because I know they will before my next one. And the older children should be able to help her with simple daily chores. Dishes,sweeping,vacuuming and such could easily be done by them. Sahm can have burn out because even though they might not be doing manual labor trust me the mental labor is in overdrive especially with her trying to homeschool 3 and take care of newborn. I think both of you should apologize to each other and have family discussion with the older kids and find compromise on how to help each other out better.", "I don't know who's the AH is here, but in general, it's probably not a good idea to ask for favors like that with both of you stretched so thin. You've been working all day, but she's been working NONSTOP and hasn't had the opportunity to sit down yet. \n\nAlso, is homeschooling the best idea for you both? Seems like you may be taking on too much as a couple. Parents need a break, and school provides that.", "I'm probably gonna get heat for this but I'm gonna say a gentle ESH. Your work is highly physically demanding, and I sympathize that you had an especially rough day that day and probably felt like you went through a few rounds with a meat grinder...but this doesn't seem to actually be about that day.\n\nParenting is a 24/7 job and maintaining a home is roughly the same. Your routine seems to be working your job 5 days a week, running for groceries \\~5 days a week, doing laundry \\~1 day a week (a task that mostly does itself), and then an unknown amount of childcare 7 days a week. If we break that down that's 13 hrs/day at work, \\~1/2 hour for grocery shopping, and we'll say \\~4 hours for laundry since you've got 6 people's worth so that's....65 hours of work + 2.5 hours of shopping + 4 hours of laundry = **71.5 weekly hours of work and housekeeping** plus whatever unknown time of childcare. It also bears mentioning that nearly all of your tasks have clear start and ends and are uninterrupted blocks of task doing time.\n\nYour wife's routine seems to be cooking and cleaning up after all meals 3x a day 7 days a week, cleaning and upkeeping the whole house in general 7 days a week, taking care of a newborn that (at minimum) requires feeding and changing roughly every 3 hours of the entire day and night 7 days a week, and teaching 3 children (which is hard even when you do it for a living) 5 days a week. Most of these tasks are actually hard to quantify time for because they don't really end, and aren't done without interruption, but google estimates that stay-at-home parents spend \\~3 total hours a day on household cleaning and upkeep. If you estimate an hour for meal prep and clean-up, and a typical 8am-3pm school day...you're looking at 21 hours for meals + 35 hours for school + 21 hours of housekeeping for a total of **77 hours of work a week** plus the random needs of the children plus the 24/7 needs of the newborn that her body is unendingly working to provide milk for and still healing from bringing into this world. Are you beginning to see her frustration?\n\nI'm not trying to vilify you here because I truly do empathize with you and your wife's situation. I think what it comes down to is a lack of perspective, a lack of communication, a lack of planning, and a mentality that's become you against her instead of both of you against the problem. Loads of people are saying that you need to be more involved with the childcare, and that is true, but it's still not going to fix the problems. By the time you get home on a typical day, your kids are getting close to bed time and don't exactly need a lot of parental oversight. Taking on the baby does help but still leaves all the house and cooking stuff so, again, helpful but doesn't solve the problem.\n\nI think what you and your wife need to work out is better planning for your meals so you're not having to shop so often and getting your kids more involved around the house. There's no reason whatsoever why they can't be helping with things like the dishes, cleaning the house, and sorting/folding/putting away laundry. The teens are well old enough to help with meals. Breakfast and lunch are easy places to start and even just helping with ingredient prep for meals can be a big help. I'm not advocating to turn your kids into servants by the way. These are life skills they need to learn how to do and it's important to foster a positive mentality of supporting and helping each other and helping to take care of the home they live in.", "\n\t1. She should totally let those three kids go back to school \u2013 trying to homeschool them is just driving her crazy!\n\t2. Let the 13 and 14-year-olds focus on basic stuff like cleaning and cooking; it\u2019ll set them up for real-life skills.\n\t3.\tYeah, both parents are tired, I get it.

Tell her about your day, and try to take off some stuff from her shoulders.", "I'm leaning either NAH or much lighter YTA than everyone here is giving you. Both of what you and your wife do is exhausting, but for different reasons and in different ways. Where you are probably somewhat of TA is in not looking out for what your wife needs while you are at home. She just had a kid 7-weeks ago, and a baby that young doesn't allow for meaningful sleep, so she's not less tired than you are. Where you might not be TA is that I don't personally see a problem with asking somebody to do something. You can ask, and she can say no. If she was going outside anyway, it can be a little less out of her way than it is for you already in bed.\n\nFrom a holistic perspective, you need to figure out a way to give your wife time to rest. Be a team. You look out for her, she looks out for you, and you both look out for the kids. Your work situation may also be untenable. Can you scale back on the your hours or perhaps take a job that requires less of a time commitment?", "This can all be temporary if you make some simple changes and school gets back to 'normal' soon. \n\nOrder ahead for groceries. It doesn't take long, especially if you order the same items frequently. Pick it up on your way home. Sit down over the weekend and make a meal plan. You should be able to get everything in one order. \n\nHave the older children help out. At their ages, every single one of them should have regular chores. There is absolutely no reason your wife should be doing everything at this point. They can make simple meals/snacks, wash dishes, vacuum etc. \n\nYou need to look for a better job, better employees, and/or some better equipment to avoid so many injuries. Your body isn't going to handle that much abuse for long. \n\nGonna say NAH but close to Y T A because you are both in a difficult situation right now, but make sure your wife gets to eat. Not being able to eat a meal you made is the worst. I get that you were physically injured at work and are exhausted, but she is also tired and doesn't get to clock out and leave her job. You may have her beat on physical exertion at work, but the mental load of never leaving work is another level of hell.", "Meh. Everybody has off days.", "NAH you both had a tough day and she snapped at you. Time for some communication and to validate each other's experience. Also probably time to get the older kids helping more and outsource what you can. 4 kids including a baby who's nursing? Get your groceries delivered. See if you can send the laundry out. Get the kids helping with dinner. \n\nI almost voted you're asshole because of this: it is wayyyy too much for your wife to be their teacher all day with an infant and then do all that housework after. Right or wrong, when I was 13, in a family of 5 imcluding toddler twins and a sister with severe disabilities, I was responsible for cooking dinner at least 1-2 nights a week and prepping for it the other nights by unloading the dishwashwer, tidying the kitchen and setting the table. Then my brother, 2 years younger did the dishes. We switched off from time to time. \n\nIt also probably would help if you communicate in the future \"had a horrible day, I'm in pain and won't be able to help much tonight. Can I get us pizza or takeout and paper plates?\" Even though you're working hard too, you're a team and it sounds like she doesn't feel acknowledged for what she's doing.", "I have a theory that parents put too much pressure on themselves nowadays.  No one thinks having kids do chores or using schedules is ok - but that makes the parents job so hard.\n\nI was a single parent to 3, age 4,3 and 1.  I worked full time, than came home and cooked, cleaned, fed bathed etc.  No help.  I do not remember being exhausted but the girls were all expected to tidy their rooms, do little chores as appropriate, we had a pretty firm schedule where they were in bed by 7:30 at night.  It works and its not child cruelty.\n\nI was also a live in Nanny/housekeeper for 4 ages 7, 5, 2 and 4 months.  I cleaned and cared for the kids.  Same thing, we had a schedule, kids had their little tasks.  The parents would have laughed if I asked for help!  Its truly not that hard as long as one does not think they have to be a martyr to the kids.\n\nI think todays parents just put too much onto themselves.", "NTA.

FWIW I work part time from home and lately when my partner comes home and does NOTHING after I've been up since 6 doing everything and every \"free\" moment was doing something for the family, I too lose my shit.

You forgot your lunch pail and were comfortable and didn't want to go get it because you were comfortable so you asked your wife to do yet another thing for you after spending all day nourishing the children, doing school work, housework, etc. At work you have the possibility of getting a break. Your wife does not. \n\nThe teenagers are capable. They can go down and grab something out of the vehicle. They can bring laundry up from the laundry room. \n\nComparing your work to hers is not going to help anyone. Both of you have difficult jobs in different ways. \n\nIf you have that many call outs at work, your work needs to hire more people. And if people are not applying, then they are not paying enough. \n\nI sincerely hope you are getting overtime. If you are not, you really need to stop doing all the extra work. If work can only meet deadlines if they are fully staffed and no one calls out, then they do not have enough staff for their current workload, since you have a lot of call outs every day. \n\nDo not work yourself to the bone. Find a way to give your wife actual breaks. Get the kids to help out more. They live there and eat there.

I really think communicating better would solve a lot of problems. but a general rule in our family is the we get the same amount of rest. if you are able to \"take a load off\", you should be asking her if she gets to, also. if she doesn't, then something has to give. \n\nyoure a manager and one of your employees is on tiktok all day and so you bring your frustration with him back to your family. manage him AT WORK. \n\nI say ESH, because problems should be communicated before resentment, and it sounds like she already resents you", "YTA.

And I can guarantee that if you keep up with this, she's going to build resentment and get the ick when she realises even if she has to do it alone, it will still be better to be a single parent and do all the stuff in the house without you, because right now you're just adding to the problems and the best solution for those problems is to cut the person who should and could be helping but instead just makes more work for her. Yeah you might feel that it's shit to finish work, come home just to have to do more & be a parent & not have a break or time to relax when you get home.

However, since the vaccine has been available, they haven't closed schools. \n\nIn addition, if schools actually are closed wherever they are, schools should have a plan for continuing teaching. It sounds fake, and I hope it is for the sake of the mom.", "Obviously having a fourth kid was a good decision.", "Awesome take!!", "You can get small portable machines. They don\u2019t wash huge loads, but if you are out of pants to wear or underwear, they could be great in a pinch.", "This is what I\u2019m wondering through the whole post. Can\u2019t one of the teenagers fetch items, do the dishes, even help cook?? Why is the mom doing everything when her kids are that old.", "I don't know. At that age I was perfectly capable of using a laundromat. It comes down to what you are used to doing. Dad could take the kids along with to help him do laundry and it would speed up the task quite a bit", "a 13 and 14 year old of course can go to the laundromat, after being there several times and shown how to do things... But always together. Kidding me? Don't infantilize teenagers.", "Why couldn\u2019t the 13/14 yr old do laundry at the Landry mat? They are plenty old enough to do things like this in their own. Mom or dad might just need to drop them and pick them up a couple hours later. \nHell i was taking the bus to the mall with my friends at 11/12. Note: I am extremely  fortunate to live in a very safe country / city / neighbourhood. This may not be everyones situation.", "Depending on where they live, it might be cheaper to do a subscription service with a per bag price.", "True\u2014but COVID school issues have been going on for 3+ years at this point; these ebbs and flows aren\u2019t anything new. The hubs is obvs TA here, but makes me wonder why in the world she\u2019d choose to have ANOTHER kid when it sounds like he didn\u2019t help enough in the family duties to begin with.", "Behaviour modeled by their father, I'd say", "That.. doesn't make sense. \n\nI checked several times to see if this post was from a couple of years ago. \n\nBut school aren't closing anymore because of Covid. At least not in the US", "Same. I\u2019ve subbed for teachers out with Covid already this year but the school is (obviously) still open.", "Could be a rural area with no available subs. I did hear of some rural schools in my state who had to temporarily shut down last year simply because too many staff members had called out sick. \n\nEven though I\u2019m in a metro area, my kids sometimes have to be picked up from school or come home way late because their bus driver called out sick and there are simply no subs to be found.", "Yeah more like \"pulling his weight\".\n\nAnd side note, from personal current experience, my job involves weird hours, shift work, overtime, on my feet all day. Maybe not lugging around steel, but hey whatever. And I can tell you, with a 2 month old and 2 year old at home, my days are orders of magnitide less stressful when I go to work. So I make damn sure to give my wife some time to herself as soon as I get home", "I definitely ate dinner at the table most days with a baby on my boob in the early months.\n\nOP's wife is still establishing breastfeeding, possibly still bleeding which is just unpleasant, homeschooling kids, cooking and cleaning, sounds super exhausting!", "I wonder how many meals or how often does his breastfeeding wife miss? \ud83e\udd14", "Or baby clothes! Babies make so much laundry!!", "That's if you even have the room to put a portable machine in the apartment.", "Mainly a MENTAL load.  That\u2019s where the exhaustion is unbearable.", "Unless dad is supervising so it\u2019s completely off mom\u2019s plate, getting a 13 and 14 year old to do chores is often as much or more work than doing it yourself. For OP who sounds physically tired but maybe has some bandwidth left to monitor the kids, having the teens help would be a solution, but honestly,  wouldn\u2019t count on it. Kids need to help with chores because they are learning how to be self sufficient adults, but it shouldn\u2019t be a way to take a load off the adults or everyone will end up disappointed and resentful.", "That's what my mom did. When I was done, I called her and she picked me up.", "True.", "Seriously??!! Your takeaway from reading the OP in which he explains he works 12, 13 hr days at a physically demanding job, does the grocery shopping, and the laundry for a family of 6, is that he \"doesn't help enough in the family duties to begin with\"?!", "Sometimes I ask myself why someone would fake a post in AITA when they're such an obviously shitty person.", "And I wonder how often her teenage kids offer to help her out by doing chores. Cause it sounds like never.", "I agree, I think his wife would be a lot less stressed if he asked his kids to help out. His kids will be better off as well, instead of watching a woman with a baby attached to her being their slave.", "Exactly.   No need.  They have to learn those life skills and empathy", "Two of them are actual teenagers. I started learning to do dishes at 6 and was in the rotation by 7 or 8. Even if the teenagers each took 3 nights a week, it isn\u2019t too much to ask. And they could take a bi weekly cooking turn too. None of this is an unreasonable ask.", "13 and 14 are actual teenagers who should be helping out with chores.", "lol. Was just asking myself if Artistic_Contact had ever been to a laundromat. Not a place I\u2019m sending 13&14yr olds now.", "Where I live the laundromats have posted that children under 16 cannot be left alone on the premises.  I agree with that.", "Not who you responded to, but I\u2019m firmly in the camp of \u201che works 12, 13 hr days at a physically demanding job and laundry is off-site from the home and there are already three kids to raise so why did they have another one?\u201d\n\nAccidents happen, but if this one was planned then they\u2019re just receiving what they asked for.", "You do realize at some point they have to learn how to do all these things?! Cook, clean, manage chores and other duties?   This starts in the younger years when they have the \u201cluxury\u201d of failing. \n\n13 and forgot to do the laundry/dishes/start dinner?  No biggie.  \n\n20 yr old, at college(or working full time) and all the sudden in you\u2019re working full time 2(either school or college), and having to learn to have clothes for yourself, learn to cook, budget time, prioritize workload?   \n\nSetting them up for failure.   It isn\u2019t about the chore itself getting done. Making kids/teens learn these things at home is paramount to prevent failure and feeling of no self worth or self esteem. \n\n\nWhat if they waited until engineers got to work before teaching them math?  Better yet- tossing a welder out there and say, \u201cwelp.  Figure it out!!\u201d \n\nNo! You apprentice to learn in  some trades.   You go to college for others.   \n\nFor domestic duties?", "Cleaning up after yourself is not parentifying. If she asked them to take care of the baby now that would be an issue. Those are life skills they are gonna need when they go off to college or move out.", "Aren\u2019t they her kids? I appreciate they\u2019re a blended family, so they\u2019re both of their kids at this point, but I think he wrote his step-kids. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter a ton, because he could ask them to pitch it. I\u2019m just surprised that their mother hasn\u2019t.", "Because as a parent it\u2019s your responsibility to teach your children to be responsible. Mine were doing laundry by 10 as well. They could cook, do dishes, vacuum, sweep, mop, dust  ~3 boys. Children MUST learn that daily living involves keeping shit together. I can\u2019t even believe there are still families NOT teaching boys to do anything. Ugh.", "From reading these comments it sounds like maybe some people have access to nicer, staffed laundromats. \n\nMine isn\u2019t total garbage but it\u2019s unmanned and there are several older men who go in there and hang out in front of it that I know from experience are creeps.", "Absolutely agree with you \ud83d\udcaf about the overbreeding, I ranted about that in my NTA \"vote\" comment, for sure; and I'm surprised it hasn't gotten downvoted to hell & back yet, because usually in this sub anyone who correctly points out having kids is a CHOICE gets savaged (and too many people are having too many kids these days, IMO.).", "I agree! Just not sure Reddit does generally", "I agree. They are old enough and should be taught how to wash the dishes and clean up. Even cleaning the bathrooms and such. I taught my SK how to do all the chores. They each had a different week doing such things. They never did things that were too hard. As they slowly got older I would train them on something new. They fussed as teens. I told them exactly that it is our job to prepare you for the real world. And to make sure when you get  your own place you will know how to clean. Because no girlfriend/boyfriend will want to hang out at your house if its dirty. I think I did good since they all have clean houses every time we visit."]}
