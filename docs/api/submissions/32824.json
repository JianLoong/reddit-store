It\u2019s really not a big deal. It\u2019s not like you sprinted to the front as soon as you could.", "NTA. Getting off the plane row by row is literally the least efficient way we can possibly do it, and we only continue to because of \"rudeness\".\n\nSave everyone time and get off if you are ready to.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAHbLRjF0vo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAHbLRjF0vo)", "NTA. take your opportunity. So long as you aren\u2019t holding anyone else up, you\u2019re fine. And if people think you were TA, oh well. Life goes on, and everyone moved along and got where they were going.", "Nah I think that the onus is on each passenger to get up/ get into the aisle/get their bag down as they are able to in order to disembark. If people are working on grabbing their bag in front of you and the line is just starting to move i think you should wait; just like you wouldn\u2019t jump through a door someone is starting to open, but if they are busy in their seats getting things together, go ahead. Waiting just holds up the whole line behind you, so it becomes more rude to the line than polite to the passenger still getting their things together after like 15 seconds in my mind.", "Unless the people who were sitting in those seats somehow indicated that they were waiting, it would be have polite to at least offer them the opportunity to get in when their row as next. I have difficulty walking so always wait until the plane is nearly empty to leave so I don't hold everyone up, but most people will pause and leave me a space to go until I've indicated otherwise.", "NTA.  \n\n\nLOTS of people like to remain seated and get off the plane only after most other passengers have disembarked.  Especially those with physical difficulties.  Plus, because of other people needing out, you sort of had to move forward.    \n\n\nThere's no real order to when people get into the aisle and out of the plane.  The only time you should not, is when the flight attendants have specifically stated for everyone to remain seated because there are people who have tight connections who are being allowed to deplane first (such as with delays on the tarmac getting to the gate and so on).  \n\n\nOther than that, it's sort of a semi-polite cluster.  The guy who was all bothered by it...seriously?  He was \"delayed\" by less than a second.", "YTA. You deplane row by row. People don\u2019t lose their spot in line just because they don\u2019t dive into the aisle the second the seat belt light goes off.", "NTA, if they are still seated I can move forward, you never know when someone is waiting for everyone to leave or just not ready to move  yet due to stiffness or something else, the space was there, you took it without running anyone down, no problem.", "Yes, YTA.  You deplane row by row.", "NTA, apparently that behavior is rude. But you know what's ruder?  People that lollygag, and don't make a move to get off the plane until there is a big gap in the line.\n\nIf you struggle with getting your bag down, let other people by so there are no delays.  If you are mobile challenged or you are wrangling little kids and all their bags, wait until others are off. \n\nIf anyone jumped the line, I would shrug and not give two shits, you never know when someone is running to meet a connecting flight.", "YTA. Specifically because they were clearly making an effort to get out of their seats and you shoved in front of them. Most aircraft disembarked by row so you shoved in front of a bunch of people, which is extremely rude.", "People with disabilities sit until the last second. Next time just ask them if they are ready to disembark. You didn\u2019t don\u2019t anything wrong, you were just oblivious.", "YTA and lucky you didn\u2019t get into trouble.", "NTA, and the microscope airplane behavior is under is getting ridiculous", "YTA for sure. Get off row by row. Not that complicated. Be patient. The guy that ran up to be next to his wife was an AH too.", "I think we do have pretty good rules of etiquette for de-planing. Row by row. Works just fine. Nobody needs to figure it out.  We got it pretty well settled, unless you have people who think they can't wait ten seconds.", "The rule is row by row. Really not that hard of a concept.", "And YOU'd be delayed by less than a few seconds to let them get out of the aisle and get their bags.  If YOU don't wait, who do you think should wait?  The guy behind you? Come on.  \n\nAnd of course some people choose to wait, but they aren't semi-standing up.  They are seated, with no intention to move", "I don't really think it's lots of people who like to remain seated. I fly quite regularly and can't remember the last time I saw somebody still seated as I walked up the aisle to get off.", "Absolutely. Stay in your assigned area, wait your turn. Nobody wants your ass and elbows in their face while waiting to deplane", "Yes, yes they do. I'm not standing there waiting fifteen minutes for someone who doesn't have their shit together, holding up the whole back of the plane.", "What? It is common courtesy to let people out before you but there\u2019s no hard and fast rule. I\u2019m not going to wait for someone to faff around when I can be out and on my way.", "We do the same when traveling with our small child. We wait until everyone else is off. Then my husband can get the bags and I can help the little guy off.", "Nah, it's just being civilized.  If you are in a middle or window seat, when exactly should you be able to get your stuff?  Because if people from the back aisle rows are able to get up and get their bags, then presumably, they're ready first and they should get to all deplane first? Nope. Aisle guy gets out, gets his stuff, stands while middle and window people get their stuff. When you stand up, you let the rows in front of you get their stuff and move ahead. THEN you go. Otherwise, it's just a rush to the front?  Come on.  Then all the window people will be very last off the plane? no, it goes by row. Also, you pay more for seats nearest the front of the plane. This is why.", "Completely agree. From the waiting area it's easy to see who completely disrupts the deplaning process. A 3-5 minute gap and then a ton of people means someone doesn't care they're dicking everyone over.", "No one said a hard and fast rule, but it's rude to do otherwise.  And someone is 'faffing around' because they ahven't been able to get out of their seat to get their luggage because the aisle person has been in the way.  So you wait 30 seconds bro and deplan in a civilized fashion. Where you gotta be in such a hurry? You have to wait for the luggage carousel anyways.  Or, you can hold your damn horses. What will you save, 30 seconds?  Big man.", "Yeah, exactly... if everyone did what OP did, the aisle seats would all go first and middle in the middle row/window seat would have to wait because the aisle has to be clear so they can get their bags from the overhead bins. If everyone \"fills the gaps,\" then there's no room to get stuff down and it takes longer. \n\nUnless the plane was delayed and you have a tight layover, go row-by-row.... (and shoutout to the people who let me deplane first even though I was toward the middle of the plane after the plane was delayed for hours and I had 10 minutes to make my connecting flight!)"]}
