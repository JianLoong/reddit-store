It\u2019s really not a big deal. It\u2019s not like you sprinted to the front as soon as you could.", "NTA. Getting off the plane row by row is literally the least efficient way we can possibly do it, and we only continue to because of \"rudeness\".\n\nSave everyone time and get off if you are ready to.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAHbLRjF0vo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAHbLRjF0vo)", "NTA. take your opportunity. So long as you aren\u2019t holding anyone else up, you\u2019re fine. And if people think you were TA, oh well. Life goes on, and everyone moved along and got where they were going.", "Nah I think that the onus is on each passenger to get up/ get into the aisle/get their bag down as they are able to in order to disembark. If people are working on grabbing their bag in front of you and the line is just starting to move i think you should wait; just like you wouldn\u2019t jump through a door someone is starting to open, but if they are busy in their seats getting things together, go ahead. Waiting just holds up the whole line behind you, so it becomes more rude to the line than polite to the passenger still getting their things together after like 15 seconds in my mind.", "Unless the people who were sitting in those seats somehow indicated that they were waiting, it would be have polite to at least offer them the opportunity to get in when their row as next. I have difficulty walking so always wait until the plane is nearly empty to leave so I don't hold everyone up, but most people will pause and leave me a space to go until I've indicated otherwise.", "NTA.  \n\n\nLOTS of people like to remain seated and get off the plane only after most other passengers have disembarked.  Especially those with physical difficulties.  Plus, because of other people needing out, you sort of had to move forward.    \n\n\nThere's no real order to when people get into the aisle and out of the plane.  The only time you should not, is when the flight attendants have specifically stated for everyone to remain seated because there are people who have tight connections who are being allowed to deplane first (such as with delays on the tarmac getting to the gate and so on).  \n\n\nOther than that, it's sort of a semi-polite cluster.  The guy who was all bothered by it...seriously?  He was \"delayed\" by less than a second.", "YTA. You deplane row by row. People don\u2019t lose their spot in line just because they don\u2019t dive into the aisle the second the seat belt light goes off.", "NTA, if they are still seated I can move forward, you never know when someone is waiting for everyone to leave or just not ready to move  yet due to stiffness or something else, the space was there, you took it without running anyone down, no problem.", "Yes, YTA.  You deplane row by row.", "NTA, apparently that behavior is rude. But you know what's ruder?  People that lollygag, and don't make a move to get off the plane until there is a big gap in the line.\n\nIf you struggle with getting your bag down, let other people by so there are no delays.  If you are mobile challenged or you are wrangling little kids and all their bags, wait until others are off. \n\nIf anyone jumped the line, I would shrug and not give two shits, you never know when someone is running to meet a connecting flight.", "YTA. Specifically because they were clearly making an effort to get out of their seats and you shoved in front of them. Most aircraft disembarked by row so you shoved in front of a bunch of people, which is extremely rude.", "People with disabilities sit until the last second. Next time just ask them if they are ready to disembark. You didn\u2019t don\u2019t anything wrong, you were just oblivious.", "YTA and lucky you didn\u2019t get into trouble.", "NTA, and the microscope airplane behavior is under is getting ridiculous", "YTA for sure. Get off row by row. Not that complicated. Be patient. The guy that ran up to be next to his wife was an AH too.", "I think we do have pretty good rules of etiquette for de-planing. Row by row. Works just fine. Nobody needs to figure it out.  We got it pretty well settled, unless you have people who think they can't wait ten seconds.", "The rule is row by row. Really not that hard of a concept.", "And YOU'd be delayed by less than a few seconds to let them get out of the aisle and get their bags.  If YOU don't wait, who do you think should wait?  The guy behind you? Come on.  \n\nAnd of course some people choose to wait, but they aren't semi-standing up.  They are seated, with no intention to move", "I don't really think it's lots of people who like to remain seated. I fly quite regularly and can't remember the last time I saw somebody still seated as I walked up the aisle to get off.", "Absolutely. Stay in your assigned area, wait your turn. Nobody wants your ass and elbows in their face while waiting to deplane", "Yes, yes they do. I'm not standing there waiting fifteen minutes for someone who doesn't have their shit together, holding up the whole back of the plane.", "What? It is common courtesy to let people out before you but there\u2019s no hard and fast rule. I\u2019m not going to wait for someone to faff around when I can be out and on my way.", "We do the same when traveling with our small child. We wait until everyone else is off. Then my husband can get the bags and I can help the little guy off.", "Nah, it's just being civilized.  If you are in a middle or window seat, when exactly should you be able to get your stuff?  Because if people from the back aisle rows are able to get up and get their bags, then presumably, they're ready first and they should get to all deplane first? Nope. Aisle guy gets out, gets his stuff, stands while middle and window people get their stuff. When you stand up, you let the rows in front of you get their stuff and move ahead. THEN you go. Otherwise, it's just a rush to the front?  Come on.  Then all the window people will be very last off the plane? no, it goes by row. Also, you pay more for seats nearest the front of the plane. This is why.", "Completely agree. From the waiting area it's easy to see who completely disrupts the deplaning process. A 3-5 minute gap and then a ton of people means someone doesn't care they're dicking everyone over.", "No one said a hard and fast rule, but it's rude to do otherwise.  And someone is 'faffing around' because they ahven't been able to get out of their seat to get their luggage because the aisle person has been in the way.  So you wait 30 seconds bro and deplan in a civilized fashion. Where you gotta be in such a hurry? You have to wait for the luggage carousel anyways.  Or, you can hold your damn horses. What will you save, 30 seconds?  Big man.", "Yeah, exactly... if everyone did what OP did, the aisle seats would all go first and middle in the middle row/window seat would have to wait because the aisle has to be clear so they can get their bags from the overhead bins. If everyone \"fills the gaps,\" then there's no room to get stuff down and it takes longer. \n\nUnless the plane was delayed and you have a tight layover, go row-by-row.... (and shoutout to the people who let me deplane first even though I was toward the middle of the plane after the plane was delayed for hours and I had 10 minutes to make my connecting flight!)", "YTA.  Those people were \u201ckind of hunched over\u201d because the overhead bins are too low to stand upright when you are beneath them.  The man who was standing hunched over didn\u2019t \u201cthrow his bag in front of you\u201d, he tried to get out of his seat.  And you were too impatient to wait your turn.", "Why do people have to jump up right away to get off the plane?  All you do is make it take longer getting off", "I just get into a hole when it's convenient\n\nnever had a problem", "Speaking as a frequent flyer of a few decades, NTA.\n\nEveryone wants to get off the plane ASAP. In all these scenarios, if you leave a gap in front of you, you are the AH who's delaying everyone behind you. In this case, the people not ready to go when it was their turn were the AH. The whole scenario is their fault, not yours. If I were seated behind you, I would appreciate you walking when you did.\n\nETA: Many comments get this wrong (as people here commonly read just the title and maybe the first paragraph), so adding this: The people in question really weren't ready to disembark. By the time the situation played out *there was an empty aisle seat next to them*. They obviously weren't ready to leave the plane because they did not move into that seat, towards the aisle. It's literally impossible to go around a person who's ready to disembark from a row in front of you simply because they'll move from the aisle seat into the aisle. Plus, OP is already on their level and there are other people standing behind them, it's not like they have the option to go back. There's literally nothing better to do in this situation than what OP did. Nobody else was able to use the gap. Everyone else on the plane benefitted, and the few people in that row weren't actually hurt: they could still leave the plane approximately at the same time they would if OP did not exist. By the time they could actually move into the aisle, OP was already gone.", "NTA\n\nI hate it when people ahead of me faff about getting sorted, putting on coats, attempting to get luggage down while blocking the empty aisle in front of them. \n\nIMHO...if you're in the aisle you're moving towards the door. If you can't get your bag and move...then just bloody wait.  In a row. Out of the aisle.", "ESH. Standing up as soon as the plane lands just to crowd the isle for 10 minutes is fucking annoying", "NTA. \n\nIf someone isn\u2019t ready to deplane then there\u2019s absolutely no issues with walking ahead. Otherwise you\u2019ll just be blocking everyone else behind you.", "If you are already standing please get the f off the plane so that the rest of us can get up and get our stuff and leave efficiently. And if you don't have a connecting flight and an attendant asks you to let people connecting leave first SIT DOWN and WAIT, I promise you the plane won't take off without letting you leave first. Disembarking row by row is the dumbest thing ever. Please stop doing it!!!! \n\n\nNTA", "NTA.  They did not begin to prepare to deplane until it was actually time to deplane, even though there was space initially.  Because of their delay, they would have caused everyone behind them to have to wait for longer", "Nta", "NTA \n\nThe only time I've ever experienced people getting up and off by rows was during/just after covid.\n\nDeplaning is back to normal now which means that you get your stuff when there's a gap in the line.", "NTA you should never shove in front of someone, but if there's a gap and you can go, then go. No one else was affected or delayed from you getting off the plane in this way.", "NTA. You have to keep the flow going. If the person in front of you has stalled, you move ahead.", "NTA. I need people to just......get off the plane. Go. Keep moving. I hate be stuck watching people do performative politeness. \"Oh go ahead\" \"No you go\" \"No I insist.\" No one is going to hand you a gold sticker. Especially not the flight attendants who need you off so they can get to cleaning. Get. Off. The. Plane. \n\nWhy should everyone suffer because I wait until the very last second to bother to get my stuff together? If I dilly dally I should expect to have people go around me.\n\nThere is a difference between someone all ready to go and no one will let them step out VS I need to get my bag out from under the seat, and my suitcase from the over head bin, and put my coat in my carry on....\n\nGet. Going.", "NTA\n\nOnce you\u2019re in the aisle ready to go you\u2019re just taking up space. Assuming you don\u2019t shoulder check someone in the process, the faster you get out of the way the faster everyone gets off.\n\nThe only exception imo is when the flight attendants ask everyone to wait for specific people to get off first for whatever reason.", "NTA. People need to go with the flow, and you are not to blame for flowing with the go.", "NTA\n\nIf a person doesn't isn't up and prepared to grab their bag and deplane the second their row is up, they get left behind.  If there is an empty aisle seat they should have moved one person into it when the doors opened IMO. \n\nI always get a window seat so the slowpokes irritate me every time I encounter one. If I can be ready to skedaddle without prep room, they have no excuse.", "Lots of main characters in these comments. The correct answer is you wait for everyone in the aisle ahead of you to go before you go, unless it\u2019s clear they\u2019re not planning on moving any time soon (*not* just that they\u2019re moving slower than you\u2019d like).\n\nBut, NTA in this hyper-specific example where you were kinda confused what to do, not charging ahead of people on purpose. You should have just said something of that effect to the guy as a form of quick apology/acknowledgment of accidental wrongdoing.", "NTA.", "Lmao I don\u2019t know what it is about y\u2019all but Americans are so impatient and angry all the time when it comes to air travel. Canadian flights are so chill, everyone just sits and waits until the doors are actually open and people can move, and no one gets angry at each other", "Always amazes me how impatient people are, leaping out of their seats, grabbing their bags, often before being given the OK by the cabin crew, and then having to stand and wait until the doors are open and the people in front have gone. We always wait until virtually everyone is off the plane and take our time to disembark, and then we meet them all again in bagage reclaim ;)", "I wish \\*everyone\\* would stay seated when the plan stops. The first rows get up, get their stuff and deplane. The next row does the same. The next row does the same. I absolutely hate when I'm seated in the aisle seat toward the back of the plane and somebody gets up and sticks their ass in my face until everybody in front of them deplanes.", "Some people gotta pee. Some people have bad backs and it hurts to sit so they want to stand and get off etc. it\u2019s not just about getting off the plane to be first in line at baggage claim.", "This is such a non-issue I can\u2019t even give it a vote lmao", "NTA.  In a perfect world row one would leave followed by rows 2, 3, 4,5 etc but that's not how it works in reality.  On a plane, everyone in the aisle seat jump up to get their overhead bags and then it's chaos. Some people get their stuff together quickly, some are slowly fussing and getting organized in the seats and sometimes in the aisle.  If you saw them trying to stand up to leave their seats it would have been polite to let them go in front of you.  I think the man throwing his bag in front of you was more wrong here.", "NTA. If anything, the guy committed assault by grabbing your shoulder. Plus, people who are not immediately moving into aisle position have no right of way over people actually in the aisle.", "NTA\n\nRow by row is incredibly inefficient and if they weren\u2019t ready enough to not fill the gap, someone needed to. Good on you OP\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted because I said row by row is bad but seriously, it is. If you\u2019re that anal about row by row, you better be handing the bags of the other passengers of the row to them , otherwise you\u2019re contributing to the inefficiency by your logic.", "NAH\n\nThe unspoken rule of de-boarding a plane is to do it row by row, kind of like a school bus. We can\u2019t blame you for not knowing, and we can\u2019t blame them for being annoyed you took up the space they were making. Everyone is on edge once that seatbelt sign turns off. This was a lesson learned and now you know about this unspoken rule and to be patient when disembarking. However you will be an asshole if you decide to ignore the rule.", "I always try to move quickly up the aisle once the seatbelt signs go off. \n\nWhy anyone is wasting time I never understand. \n\nNTA", "Seems like half the commenters here have only seen planes on the TV. \nIf people in the rows ahead of you aren't shaking their ass towards the aisle then you keep moving forward. \nIf they are ready to stand and leave you let them out. \nHow hard can it be?", "NTA, it goes row by row but it\u2019s not the law.

I am also not waiting extra time just standing in the row if these people aren\u2019t ready to go when its their turn I am just going to go. They can visibly see who is getting up if they aren\u2019t ready that is on them in my opinion. This isn\u2019t a sit down restraunt there is still customs, plus people have places to be get moving or get out of the way. \n\nI have been on planes and seen people efficiently go row by row.

Maybe the people around you were just patiently waiting their turn before making moves?\n\nAlso rushing past people to get off the flight isn\u2019t the \u201emost efficient\u201c as people are saying. It saves the one person running off the plane time and from my perspective makes it seem like they value their time more than others. I think the best option is to file off and to help the person in front of you if they need it. Sometimes family or elderly types that know they are slow will chose to wait to deplane and that\u2019s when it\u2019s fine to pass them. \n\nCaveat could be if you have a tight connection, in which case you should talk to the flight attendants about what services can be offered to get you to your gate quickly at the next airport but when most people on a flight hear you need to get off quick they will try to help.\n\nIf everyone had the same mindset of the people running off flights I\u2019m pretty sure every flight would end in a brawl.", "NTA.

If they\u2019re not making moves to get out, then you can go ahead.", "everyone is coming from a side street, beginning at the exact same time, trying to merge onto the main road. each of these people must also pause to retrieve their carry on luggage, requiring those who were already on on the main road heading towards them to pause\u2014 much like they do at a red light. your analogy doesn\u2019t make it make more sense, it still aligns with what I said.", "You might find life easier in general if you just stop, take a step back and realize we are in this together and getting frustrated over someone taking a few extras seconds to do something is not the end of the world.", "Exactly. If they're not ready to stand up and step into the aisle, that's fine, but that means someone else can move ahead. If there's a gap, then they obviously aren't ready to go.", "He shouldn't have been 'past' the guy if the guy is in a row in front of him. You just wait and let everyone off, row by row. Then there's no chaos.\n\nAnd sorry, sometimes I respond as though talking directly to OP :)", "What you are describing is a disorganized chaotic mess that would never work. And if you think it would only take ten seconds for an entire plane of aisle seats to get out before middle and window can move, then I don't even know what to say.", "Yes there's a limit, but often when someone knows they need more time they wave you on and wait.  But if everyone just filled gaps, then all the window seat people have to wait till the end but moreso, is that it creates a rush to the aisles.  That's going to cause problems.", "I can recall reading somewhere that the most efficient way to exit would be to do so in columns, not rows.\n\ni.e - everyone in the aisle seats goes and then when they have cleared the middle seat, then finally the window.\n\nObviously this is not practical for families, if people have disabilities and need support or other specific scenarios. But what is the big deal if someone ducks ahead where there is a gap? So someone in an aisle seat waited slightly longer. As long as the flow is continuous that is the main thing.\n\nHaving said all that, I am always bemused by the intense rush to get off the plane first only for everyone to have wait for a bus to the terminal, or the baggage claim, or customs anyway. or slowly descend the stairs with their carry on. (And don't get me started on people who line up 15 minutes early to get on first, then have to sit and wait for everyone else to board anyway).", "This is the way normal people do it.", "My favorite thing to watch is people rushing to board. Obviously some need extra time and space, but for everyone else, I'm like.... We're all going to the same place? And seats are assigned? Planes are cramped, I don't want to be on it any longer than necessary, but Betty and Fred just HAVE to be at the front of the line!", "Travelling with a four year old, my husband and I just waited until most people had disembarked so kiddo and his ADHD brain wouldn't hold everyone else up. A number of people from the rear of the plane offered to let us out, but our son was happy enough watching things out the window and swinging his legs, no need for us to rush.", "It is very dumb, yes.", "All the aisles should get up and go, then all the next seats together, then windows last\u2026but it\u2019ll never happen", "Yes, everyone should just rush forward and f@ck everyone else. Most people regardless of where they are sitting get their things and hold them. Then go row by row. Seriously if you can't stick your face in your phone for a few seconds to actually be polite and let others go before you that is a problem.", "This comment is confusing me as this is the way most planes I've been on have disembarked. Like, yes, sometimes people go on ahead but not the majority. Row by row is the norm.", "Because most people don't travel alone", "Because it isn't faster for everyone.", "Because if there\u2019s a backup at the front getting off (filling the gap implies there was people up front still) then in reality it isn\u2019t being quicker, just quicker for the rude guy.  \n\nRow by row unless there\u2019s an issue", "\"OK, I know you're a toddler but you're in the window and I'm in the aisle.

Same argument.", "Not even theoretically, it has been done in experiments, window, middle, aisle is a whole ten minutes faster boarding than block boarding.", "Nobody is \"rushing off first\", but you have to keep the line moving.

There should be a steady line of people leaving the plane.", "The people who can be ready first should leave first. It's the most efficient system. isle seat middle seat window seat is also organised, and more efficient. You think you deserve to leave first because you paid $10-$15 dollars. How about instead of that entitlement you just be annoyed the airline is doing that. (though I have never paid extra to reserve a seat and have sat at the front plenty, maybe this is a US thing).\n\nOh how I wish the attendants would just announce stop being an entitled wanker and use some common sense\n\nedit: Also note that attendants **dont** hesitate to announce things they actually want to happen. And they certainly do enforce onboarding order. So you just gave another clear example of how this is not a thing you are actually entitled to", "If you care about leaving together (which you would if you have a 3 year old) yes **of course** you should stay seated until last instead of holding other people up lol. Children are slow, you should wait and go last. And if you are just as a couple you go when is convenient and reunite in the luggage area or you wait. Not hold other people up to insist you leave together.\n\nYes there are usually a few families, but it's usually the minority of the people on the plane. By the time everyone who doesn't have something that makes them slower gets off you can take your sweet ass time.", "You are not really understanding the efficiency argument. \n\nIn your family example, presumably one parent (on the aisle) has got up and removed all overhead luggage already. In this case, if the entire family deplanes together that is totally fine, since the *flow of passengers is maintained*.   None of the NTA's here would have a problem with that!\n\nThe problem comes when rear passengers, with *ready luggage*, have to wait while the middle and aisle passengers step into the aisle and retrieve their luggage, which *disrupts the flow* of passengers. This *increases* overall time to deplane and is not efficient.", "Nah I think I'll just take the 5 seconds to walk past instead of waiting a minute for those morons who paid extra to be faffing about for no reason. There are no queues for deplaning and anyone pretending otherwise is a moron", "They say it in most flights here. But it's automatic with business/ frequent travellers. It's only overreacting tourists creating chaos all the time with being in the aisle before they're due OR not paying attention or signalling that they won't leave just now.", "I mean I remeber being told to deplane by row, but it's been a while since I flew (like 6 months) so I might not be remembering well. \n\nHow do we embark? Do e go window, middle, aisle? Or do we go by row?", "Sure, people like you exist and I should have written \"most people want to get off the plane ASAP\" to be 100% correct.\n\nI don't really understand why you feel the need to nitpick on this particular detail in my answer. It was an obvious exaggeration and the edit to make it formally correct would change literally nothing in the rest of it. Conflicts like this one arise *between* people who want to get off the plane quickly, *because* they want to get off the plane quickly.", "Exactly this. You give the row in front of of you the opportunity to go. If they don\u2019t, you fill the gap. It\u2019s not that hard.", "Sure, and everyone can wait at baggage together anyways.\n\nNOt just a little stressful having to be worried about people behind me getting their panties in a bunch if I let me wife in the window seat a chance to get her bags and deplane with me?  I mean, oh the horror! lol", "But just imagine, if the rule  is 'he who gets to the aisle first, deplanes first'...then what do the seconds leading up to the plane coming to a full stop look like? Everyone pops up, there's jockeying for position, I mean come on.  It's in effect, a line up.  Guy in the middle or window can't get into the aisle. It's not that he isn't 'ready' it's that he's not being let in. That's why in traffic, you yield to those merging onto the highway, it's orderly, it's faster. For EVERYONE, not just the lucky aisle people and/or pushers/shovers. Just wait your damn turn.\n\nAlso, usually when selecting your seat ahead of time, the seats towards the front are more expensive than the seats in the back.  I wonder why that is, if not that you get to deplane first\n\n(connecting flights aside...in which case attendants should make an announcement to have everyone remain seated until the connectors jump off)", ">Who has the authority to define what is 'civilized'?\n\nNot you, thankfully.", "Because if everyone treats it like first into the aisle goes fastest, then what do you end up with? Kind of chaos, right? By your logic, the ones in the window seats and/or the ones who somehow don't jump up and block the aisle so they can get their stuff down, are the 'losers' who have to wait, right? So you're in the aisle seat, the guy in the aisle opposite you stood up first so you can't get your bag.  So now the entire aisle is full behind you, and in front of you.  You now have to wait until everyone in all the seats behind you (quite possibly) go first as they rush past you without giving you a moment to get your bag.  So if you don't jump up first, you're screwed and who cares because it's every man for himself right? So your next flight, you'll pop out of your seat ahead of the next guy because you don't want to wait for the whole flight of people to pass you by because you're not going to be THAT sucker again, right?  Sounds like fun.  It's a line bro, just wait in it.", "Yup. It is an American thing. And the hilarious part is - some of them get extremely indignant when what they consider 'common courtesy' is not universally accepted. \n\nEven funnier in this case, where what they are recommending is literally the *least efficient* way of deplaning.", "So they should wait...", "If that\u2019s the case you are expected to wait for everyone has already gotten off the plane for a flight attendant to help you. I would expect that they usually tell you as that is what happened when I was flying and needed assistance.", "Well then they need the assistance of a flight attendant and need that addressed before take off or after everyone else departs. How is the flight attendant supposed to help them if the aisle is full of people?", "And I would love to help that person out. But as I understand what OP described, they sat there with an empty aisle next to them and didn\u2019t move at all until the line was leaving. Why didn\u2019t they fill the space?", "Lucky you. I\u2019ve missed connections due to this. One time I had to run through the airport concourses and got there just after they closed the door. It was the last flight of the night and I was in a strange city where I knew no one. \n\nThe airline eventually  took me and the other ppl on my flight who arrived at the gate after me to a motel 30 minutes away where we were allowed to sleep for 2-3 hours before they had someone pick us up to go back to the airport.  They had given us meal vouchers but everything in the airport was closed, so we were all hangry, too. \n\nDon\u2019t presume to know what someone else\u2019s situation is or why they might be in a rush. Connecting flights, illness or death in family, business emergencies, etc\u2026 or bathroom emergencies!

I don\u2019t fly unless I absolutely have to. \n\nEfficiency is best.", "Oh, and I also don\u2019t check bags unless I absolutely have to. While you are strolling to baggage claim, I\u2019m already on the bus on my way home.", "OK but again, the middle and window seats are at the mercy of the aisle-sitter.", "Why is your time more valuable than theirs?", "I'm 6'6\" it's not that comfortable hunching over. Trust me I can get up out of that seat as fast as someone hunched over kneeling to get to the aisle and grab my bag", "What do you think is going to happen if everyone grabs their overhead luggage at the same time?", "I stand so I can stretch my legs. If there\u2019s space ahead I take it. That\u2019s always been my logic", ">people in the aisle yield to the people in the rows ahead of them who are getting out of the seat and window.\n\nAnd that is why it takes longer than it needs to. When everyone who is ready to move actually moves the isle will get empty and more people can get up sooner. This way the plane will get empty from the back and there will be no need for any jostling in the isle.\n\nNot that it really matters, it only takes a few minutes and most of us will be waiting for the baggage carousel anyway...", "There are no red lights on a plane, and if there was it would be where the iles meet at the front.\n\nIf you are in traffic, would you leave a gap knowing that the guy you are letting in is likely to park in the lane and go to the mailbox?", "This isn't about me.  I am not the one frustrated.   I was responding to a different situation where the OP was called an asshole. I don't need some random stranger telling me not to get frustrated about a situation that I witnessed.  I will reiterated, this is not about me.  \n\nHave a great day!", "In some cases it can be the difference between making your connection or not.

Standing in line for ten minutes while waiting for a bus sounds amazing for me.", "I think this is the effect of how airlines themselves work these days. Not enough overhead space and more people using carry-ons, so people want to get on first to ensure their carry-ons don\u2019t have to get checked. \n\nPeople rush to get off because they cram people in so tight no one is comfortable.

Snob much?\n\nMaybe suggest to the airlines that those without checked bags can deplane first.  I mean good luck, because no one will pay attention as no one can tell one from the other and everyone will just rush anyways.  So really then, according to you, do whatever you want to rush into the aisle and get to the front as quickly as YOU want to, to hell with everyone else.", "So who decides that, and what would be easiest to manage on a plane? If there's going to be a 'rule' then it should be carried out as such, the courtesy rule of a 'line up' is the default because people know how it works, its easy to figure out.  If you want an aisle first approach, then it should be stated. I mean, sure.  But I mean, good luck with that.", "You did, in fact, read that correctly.  Not everyone is owed a response, and the world will keep spinning.", "You're rude!", "Someone think of the poor Americans being judged! \ud83d\ude06", "Actually I think I mistakenly replied to the wrong comment. I would say I have toh to you but it\u2019s balanced out by the use of the word butthurt and your invalidation of my very true anecdote. \n\nCall it even and call it a day? I wish you a good one! \ud83d\ude0a", "Because you mentioned that everyone has to still get their bags at baggage claim so there\u2019s no reason to hurry.", "1. WILMA is the **second** fastest way to board. [https://simpleflying.com/fastest-boarding-type-guide/](https://simpleflying.com/fastest-boarding-type-guide/)  \n\n2. \"I bet you would be really pissed if the person in front of you deplaning would stop at every row and let every row out ahead of them, so that all the forward rows got out first.\" This is literally how it works on 97% of flights I am on. I fly 1x a week on average, domestic US. The etiquette varies by country, but in the US most planes deplane aisle by aisle front to back. Not due to a rule, but due to etiquette customs.  Some flights where there are tight connections for passengers, the flight attendants will make an announcement asking for folks to let people in that situation off first. Some passengers do, and some passengers don't.", "1) If you are concerned with getting off the plane quickly, book a better seat near the front.\n\n2) Take it up with the airline.\n\n3) I am the person who holds up the back to make sure everyone ahead of me has a chance to get out. I help them get their bags down and needed, especially the elderly and families.", "Because they paid for the privilege of boarding and deplaning first, or used enough miles or have status on the airline. It\u2019s really a simple answer\u2026..$$$$", "No, most of the time there's a gap because someone took a long time to get a bag out, often from a middle/window seat. But the rows ahead will already be mostly empty... You aren't really cutting anyone off, just getting ahead of someone who is about to take a while.", "Some people have connections to make or people waiting to pick them up, you realize...", "I second this.  I rush onto planes because 1, Sometimes they oversell tickets and I don't want to get bumped. 2, Anytime I've had luggage checked, the stuff inside gets significantly damaged somehow.", "Absolutely agree, give the people from the rows ahead of you the chance to join the line, but if there's a huge gap, it means no one is ready to stand up and grab their bags.", "I don't have children, and have never traveled with one, but if you've ever been on a plane there are a bunch on there.\n\nI guess I'll just tell my wife \"I'll see you at the rental car counter, just get on the train and take it past terminal 5 and then follow the signs\" so I don't stand in the jetway and block all of the other passengers waiting for her.", "Wow.  So people with kids on planes are assholes? YOu're right, the nerve that people have places to go.  Unheard of! I mean, since we're on the topic, what age would the kid need to be for the travelling parents NOT to be assholes? lol. You're a delight.", "They don't because it splits groups sitting next to each other and because it incentivizes purchasing more expensive seats - which is also part of why people get so whiny about people behind going ahead.", "A kid can be 12, not necessarily a baby. If I want to get off the plane with my wife, and 12 year old kid, I'm not letting some ants-in-his-pants guy from the back make me NOT wait for two people in my row to get their bags down.  \n\nAnd honestly, your point is fair about checked bags.  Maybe the 'rule' should be, if you have a connection or no checked bags, you can go first.  But good luck with that because how are you going to police it. \n\nMaybe guy in 3rd row window has only his carry on but can't get to it because aisle and middle of the back 30 rows are going first.  How is THAT fair?", "And it's not EXTRA time, it's just letting the family get off together.  What's wrong with waiting while 4 people come out of the row at once?", "But what is the 'shit' that is happening? People disembarking row by row in an orderly fashion? \n\nIf it's every man for himself, then you literally get every man for himself. \n\nAnd sure, let's tell the 8 year old to go ahead and find carousel #4.  And no, just because I have an 8 year old who doesn't take any LONGER to move, I just want to get off WITH him, then I can, and I will. It takes THIRTY SECONDS to let out the row in front of you. And if you 'bud' in front of others, then just call it that.  Everyone's going together to chill out and wait your turn to get off.  Row by row is the only way you're not going to have jackasses rushing into the aisle to try and be first.  It's the only 'order' that makes sense that everyone can play by. Otherwise people get snippy, you get the whole OP situation where someone tried to stop him from launching ahead of others.  If everyone went single file, row by row, there would be zero problems. It takes time to get off the plane. It's annoying.  Just because you CAN zip to the front to save YOURSELF time, doesn't mean you're not making others wait even LONGER>", "OR we act like humans and keep the stream of people moving off the plane while still being considerate of others. Crazy thought, I know.", "I mean, it doesn't take some special set of skills or years of experience. Just basic common sense and not acting like a complete moron. Keep the line moving. Don't hold up a hundred people waiting on one person who's not up and ready to go. If there's a gap in the line, that means no one ahead of you is ready to go.", "By 35 seconds it's the second fastest. And the random boarding was what beat it out, not the block boarding. Block boarding was over ten minutes slower than both of those. So therefore the random deplaning is probably the fastest. Which is what the OP was doing. And block deboarding which is what the person I'm arguing with is saying should be standard, is gonna be the slowest. So being mindful of everybody's time would mean not block deboarding.\n\nEvery plane I have ever been on has had that first rush of people in aisle seats getting off, then a more sedate everyone for themselves action. I have never once seen a plane deboard fully row for row with people just stopping their forward movement to let every row in front of them. Maybe once a person will let someone that's ready step in, but there's going to be people in forward rows that just keep sitting because they aren't in a rush.", "Never on any domestic US flight I have been on have the passengers deplaned row by row. Yes, those towards the front who are ready usually get off first. But the rest of the people? Those are the ones who were ready from the middle and back who \"filled in the gaps\" to keep the line moving.", "Then you're TAH here, you're holding up an entire plane just to let slow people, who probably know they're slow and so wait to be last, in front of people just trying to get on with their day.", "This is the way. I am also that person.", "Then YTA, those people know they're slow and they're fine with waiting. Cabin crew will help anyone who needs help.", "So the people that chose the aisle......", "So becuase dude was in a middle seat and is JUST getting into the aisle now, he has to wait for everyone in the aisle to get past him until he is 'allowed' to move in and get his bag? So he has to wait for 30 people to go when he could take 15 seconds to reach above and get his bag?", "Right! I've waved people ahead before because I'm not quite ready to step out but man, it's frustrating when you are ready and people get that *get off the plane RIGHT NOW* tunnel vision and won't let anyone else escape.", "Now this I agree with ...clearly if there's a large gap and no one is making an effort to get up, for sure you go by. And yes to the 'current moving line' should stop to let someone in who is ready to join the line.", "Airports are big places, especially next to gates, there's big empty seating areas where nobody is trying to get by you. Fuckin wait there if you make it up the jetway first. This isn't that hard, you just sat touching each other the whole flight, you can stand to be separated 5 minutes in the interest of not wasting everyone else's time.", "If you\u2019re prepared to get off together and quickly get your bags down, it\u2019s not a problem. I\u2019m talking about the people that take long enough that everyone else in front of them is off the plane and there\u2019s an aisle of ppl waiting. The ones that that still have stuff they need to pack up in their seats. \n\nI don\u2019t think what you describe is a problem.", ">But what is the 'shit' that is happening? People disembarking row by row in an orderly fashion?\n\nNo that doesn't happen. What happens is people act like they have a right to go next because they are further forward, Force their way into the isle. Then idle alon and slooowly get their stuff. Taking LONGER than if just the people in the isle seats all went first and then the middle and so on. The fact you think it takes THIRTY SECONDS is laughable. And capitalising it doesn't make it true. Isle then middle then window is just as orderly as row by row. And much more efficient. \n\nAnd every parent of every 8 year old should either have all of theirs and their 8 year olds stuff out in one go and take exactly the same amount of time as one person for the two of them *or if they can't*  wait until the end. Not slow other people down because they have an 8 year old.", "If only that worked. Unfortunately, there are many who can't be reasonable.", "Guess helping the elderly and families deplane is AH behavior these days.....", "Minimal price difference between window and aisle. Nearness to from of the plane, that\u2019s where you see price difference. Excluding first class. Fist 4-5 rows are about $70 more. You don\u2019t see that from a window to aisle seat.", "Man, have you ever flown?  \nThe gate where you are arriving is already full of annoyed people waiting for the next flight, that is leaving out of that gate because that's where the plane is. They will literally walk through that same door in 15 minutes, and they're all told to be there an hour early.", "Again...everyone hurries up and waits together at the baggage carousel.  There is zero need to have travel companions deplane separately.  I mean for that matter, if they were so concerned with speed, why don't planes seat passengers window, middle, aisle?  I mean...faster right?  No. Nothing needs to be that fast. Unless you're the guy in a big fat hurry whose time is more important than everyone else's and who's too cheap to buy a seat up front.", "Those people you say you are helping are usually sitting there still because they know they are slow, they are being considerate to the people who need to catch their next flight. You stopping and forcing them up and out because you feel like you are helping are not only being an AH to everyone behind you, but you are also rushing people who are perfectly fine being slow. So yes, in this situation, what you do is AHish", "Yes, it is, because often then they feel obligated to rush as much as they can to get up so the whole plane isn\u2019t held up instead of just waiting themselves. It\u2019s fine to offer but if they aren\u2019t ready to go then keep moving.", "Thank goodness they have you white knighting for them. /s", "I fly multiple times a month, and the procedure for those that need assistance is that they deplane last with the assistance of flight crew. When I injured my foot and needed assistance, I was told to wait till last so the assistance people could help me. \n\nHelping people is great in day to day life, and if someone is struggling to reach their bag then go right ahead and help. But stopping to help people who will be taken care of by flight crew is not being helpful and is slowing down the whole process."]}
