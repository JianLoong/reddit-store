Every week for the last couple years we have been married, I grocery shop on Sunday so that I can cook and prep meals for the week as I am also in charge of meal planning for the household. \n\nThis week, we were sitting on the coach watching the football game and I asked him if he would grocery shop for me and he asked me why. I said because I was tired. His response was \u201cgo tomorrow\u201d and I can\u2019t because of work and gym, so by the time I get home and cook, it would be after 9:00 pm. He then countered with - we can eat out this week instead of groceries. I don\u2019t want to eat out because it is very expensive. I asked him \u201cWhy can\u2019t you go for me this week since I go every other time?\u201d\n\nHe flew off the handle! He said that \u201cBecause you asked me this question, I will NEVER go grocery shop in the future. Why is it my job to grocery shop when you are too tired? I said I will order food for the week. How could you even ask me this question?\u201d\n\nI explained to him that while this chore is usually my responsibility, I am asking him to help me. I reminded him that we are partners. When he is tired and asks me to help him with something, I do it without question. I am simply asking for his help this week. \n\nHe then countered with \u201cFrom now on then, I will buy only my groceries and you will buy yours. You will never have to buy or cook for me again.\u201d I explained to him that \u201cI don\u2019t mind doing the groceries and cooking, but today I am more tired than normal and that if one of us doesn\u2019t then we won\u2019t have food for the week. It\u2019s important that we eat.\u201d All he did was kiss his lips.\n\nI stand up and put my shoes on to go to the store. (He had given me his card early this morning before church so that I could go later. He pays for all the groceries while I handle some of the other bills.) He says \u201cGive me my card. You can stay here. I will order us food this week, and if you want to eat something else then you can go buy it.\u201d\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE:\nA lot of people are asking if this is normal - no, he has never had such a strong reaction like this before. We talked more and he said that by me mentioning that I always do it that I am \u201ckeeping score of who works harder\u201d", "created_utc": 1704662914, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191341b/aitah_for_asking_my_husband_to_grocery_shop/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

RED FLAG.\n\nIt's also a classic \"weaponized incompetence\" movie, but dialed way up. The usual move is to do the shopping, but do it *so badly* that you end up never asking him again because it's easier to just do it yourself. \n\nWhat he did was yell and scream and throw a fit so intense that the next time you even think about asking him to do something for you, you'll be remembering this moment and he hopes you'll decide it's not worth the fuss, and just do the thing yourself. \n\n...thrown in with a bit of what I call the \"Trunchbull Method\" (a la, Matila): be so completely over the top and ridiculous so that, when your victim is recounting the story, it sounds made up...

It's to weaken your credibility with anyone you have in your life who might otherwise take your side. \n\nIf a partner did this to me? Decided to hurt me like this, and even when I still was about to do the damn thing anyway, chose to be petty and humiliate me further? Fuck him. \n\nI'd walk upstairs, pack a bag, and fucking *leave*. \"I think you're right- I think you absolutely should be responsible for your own food and cooking from now on. And for your own clothes, cleaning, bills, and rent too.\"\n\nAny trust or comfort I had with that person would be absolutely shredded. He vowed to support you and be there for you, and help you.

Just like I have a plan for my Sunday, if he didn't want to grocery shop that day, that's okay, you didn't either. \n\nBUT, his response is really dramatic and problematic. He could have said- let's be lazy today and I'll go tomorrow, or let's do some takeout and then go shopping later in the week. But to say no and have it devolve to this level of fighting and ultimatums- all by him- is truly a problem. \n\nSo now, take him up on his offer.

I think if he pays for groceries and was paying for the takeout for week (seems like you have separate finances and if that is so then he gets to determine how he spends his) then he really wasn't the ass until you persisted.  After that his entire reaction was foolish.  Us women don't want men to control us but men also don't want that.  You said you're tired and he solved it but now you're not happy with how he is solving it.  Also, you asking him why he can't go once - maybe that once is also a time he is tired or planned something else or just didn't want to.  Look i've bought food many times that is costly but I just didn't want to make effort to cook or grocery shop.

What happened?!?! Sounds like he needs to go back to church and get a serious \u201cCome to Jesus\u201d talking to from an older man who actually loves and serves his wife. If this behavior is indicative of him in general, don\u2019t even think about having kids.  Peace be with you, girl.

They aren\u2019t at their best, so I pick up where I can.", "NTA. I\u2019m wondering how you came to be married to such an AH. Reconsider your choices, sister.", "You are NOT the asshole - it's him, without question.\n\nPlus, the idea that the grocery shopping and cooking is all your \"responsibility\" is ridiculous. The man eats the food and is presumably an adult - he can also be responsible for fetching groceries and meal prep.

Ick. Is he always this manipulative?", "NTA read up on dismissive avoidance attachment style. This reminds me so much of my husband.

Because I\u2019ve been married for many many years and it only gets worse unless you address it. Plus it kind of sounds like he\u2019s a little controlling.", "No he\u2019s definitely the asshole", "NTA. Go with his suggestion and shop/cook for yourselves! Adjust those other bills you're handling to take care of your own shit and split the common stuff 50/50. He'll get tired of that and want to renegotiate by Tuesday. \n\nHonestly, though, start doing grocery delivery, even if you have to pay for it.

In a good marriage, partners are always helping each other out, in little and big ways. Co-operation and working together makes for a happy marriage.\n\nVery good explanation\n\nSpouse and I will mark our 38th anniversary in 3 days. It's a successful relationship because we have evolved into sharing responsibility. \n\nHe cooks because I hate the chore. Told him \"I was born without the cooking gene.\" I do laundry because he has a hard time grasping why everything can't be washed in hot water. He takes care of the car maintenance and I handle landscaping stuff in the spring. However, if one of us is sick, there isn't even a question of of the other covering what needs to be done, even if it's not our assumed responsibility. \n\nOP is absolutely NTA but she is married to one who is. There are better people out there. I don't see this relationship being one of lifelong happiness or success.", "Agree. There are certain things that only I do, specifically laundry. I am very particular with how things are washed and dried/hung and actually enjoy doing laundry. It\u2019s not that he can\u2019t do it, I just choose to do it. \n\nThere have been times though that I\u2019m tired or sick or away from home and he will do the laundry without question or any resentment. A partner should be there to do their fair share as well as pick up the slack when the other partner needs a hand. \n\nYou say this is an isolated incident but if you think hard, I bet you will see a pattern of behaviour there.", "Ya that solution is exactly why we know this story is fiction.  Literally makes no sense.", "Exactly\u2026my thoughts", "Honestly it sounds like he KNOWS she does more than her share and his anger is tied to guilt about it.", "This.\n\nOP, please get into therapy. Make that expense a priority. You are very very soon either going to be broken down by him or you will have decisions to make (or both). It will be easier for you to unpack it when you have an existing relationship with a therapist.\n\nNTA. He has anger issues though. The level of toxicity here is concerning.\n\nOP, do you know how often my husband runs to the store for us? Probably twice per week because we are constantly running out of things (teens - they eat us out of house and home). Likewise, I often do the dry cleaner run for him. Part of being a couple is lightening each other's load when you can. If your husband is this selfish then you have a lot to think about BEFORE kids enter the picture.", "I don't think you would, I think you'd say \"WTAF? Who on earth do you think you ARE!?

I don't know how ppl accept this behavior. As we speak,  I have a massive headache and he just told me not to worry and that he would make dinner while he has covid.
