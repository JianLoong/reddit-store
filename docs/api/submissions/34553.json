Every week for the last couple years we have been married, I grocery shop on Sunday so that I can cook and prep meals for the week as I am also in charge of meal planning for the household. \n\nThis week, we were sitting on the coach watching the football game and I asked him if he would grocery shop for me and he asked me why. I said because I was tired. His response was \u201cgo tomorrow\u201d and I can\u2019t because of work and gym, so by the time I get home and cook, it would be after 9:00 pm. He then countered with - we can eat out this week instead of groceries. I don\u2019t want to eat out because it is very expensive. I asked him \u201cWhy can\u2019t you go for me this week since I go every other time?\u201d\n\nHe flew off the handle! He said that \u201cBecause you asked me this question, I will NEVER go grocery shop in the future. Why is it my job to grocery shop when you are too tired? I said I will order food for the week. How could you even ask me this question?\u201d\n\nI explained to him that while this chore is usually my responsibility, I am asking him to help me. I reminded him that we are partners. When he is tired and asks me to help him with something, I do it without question. I am simply asking for his help this week. \n\nHe then countered with \u201cFrom now on then, I will buy only my groceries and you will buy yours. You will never have to buy or cook for me again.\u201d I explained to him that \u201cI don\u2019t mind doing the groceries and cooking, but today I am more tired than normal and that if one of us doesn\u2019t then we won\u2019t have food for the week. It\u2019s important that we eat.\u201d All he did was kiss his lips.\n\nI stand up and put my shoes on to go to the store. (He had given me his card early this morning before church so that I could go later. He pays for all the groceries while I handle some of the other bills.) He says \u201cGive me my card. You can stay here. I will order us food this week, and if you want to eat something else then you can go buy it.\u201d\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\nUPDATE:\nA lot of people are asking if this is normal - no, he has never had such a strong reaction like this before.

RED FLAG.\n\nIt's also a classic \"weaponized incompetence\" movie, but dialed way up. The usual move is to do the shopping, but do it *so badly* that you end up never asking him again because it's easier to just do it yourself. \n\nWhat he did was yell and scream and throw a fit so intense that the next time you even think about asking him to do something for you, you'll be remembering this moment and he hopes you'll decide it's not worth the fuss, and just do the thing yourself. \n\n...thrown in with a bit of what I call the \"Trunchbull Method\" (a la, Matila): be so completely over the top and ridiculous so that, when your victim is recounting the story, it sounds made up...

It's to weaken your credibility with anyone you have in your life who might otherwise take your side. \n\nIf a partner did this to me? Decided to hurt me like this, and even when I still was about to do the damn thing anyway, chose to be petty and humiliate me further?

Just like I have a plan for my Sunday, if he didn't want to grocery shop that day, that's okay, you didn't either. \n\nBUT, his response is really dramatic and problematic. He could have said- let's be lazy today and I'll go tomorrow, or let's do some takeout and then go shopping later in the week. But to say no and have it devolve to this level of fighting and ultimatums- all by him- is truly a problem. \n\nSo now, take him up on his offer.

After that his entire reaction was foolish.  Us women don't want men to control us but men also don't want that.  You said you're tired and he solved it but now you're not happy with how he is solving it.  Also, you asking him why he can't go once - maybe that once is also a time he is tired or planned something else or just didn't want to.

Hugh red flag.", "I give him 0 days\n\nHe already said that he would just eat out. \n\nFor snacks and what not, I would bet a large amount of money he just steals her food\n\nHope they don\u2019t share finances.", "I doubt he feels guilty.", "100%. I would have immediately gotten up, packed a bag, and stayed somewhere else and ordered food for a few days.\n\nAlso something wrong when a partner never goes grocery shopping? How did such and extreme division of labor occur? In my last relationship I did the bulk of grocery shopping but my boyfriend would occasional go and pick up some stuff he wanted and would ask me if I wanted anything.\n\nI\u2019m curious what if anything, this man does. Does he just pay bills and decide his wife does the rest? This is a prime example of why I will never be a Stay at home wife.", "My Sister-In-Law was in hospital for a week last year, and I was floored by how many people asked me who was watching their kids, and when I was all \"my brother, he took the week off work\", they'd say \"by himself?\". It'd be pretty damn pathetic if he couldn't parent his own kids for a week.", "This is not the case for everyone! I would never stand for this crap. My husband and I are equals and a team, no gender role bullshit and I wouldn\u2019t be with anyone who even dreamt of speaking to me like OP\u2019s husband did. He sounds straight up abusive.", "Old lesbian here, I\u2019ve always appreciated a good man. Happy to have them and their families in my close friend circle.", "Some of these posts mortify me and make me so happy I found a good one. These dudes are garbage bags", "Wtf I thought heterophobia was just some bullshit that people made up to feel like a victim attacked by the gays. There are happy straight couples, you know that, right?", "Fair.", "A freaking men.", "100%.", "You are the sort of people I admire.", "I also question something else: if husband pays for it and wife cooks it. She is asking him to pay and get it. On top of which I also have to ask when was it asked? Because if I'm asked right when I'm getting home, then sure because I'm still in street clothes, but if I'm settled in loungewear, then forget about it. Plus, I do find it odd that she's complaining about cost when he is paying for groceries. It would be one thing if he was saying she pays for takeout, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Then, the offer to wait and have her go tomorrow instead, which was rebuffed. Frankly, I'd get a little pissy if someone shot down all my suggestions because they wanted me to do something else. I'm really thinking we aren't being told the whole story", "I learned the error of my ways and I now embrace curbside pickup. My man and I thought it was kinda bougie pre-pandemic. Let me tell you, I missed out not taking advantage of this service earlier. If it\u2019s bougie, fine. I\u2019ll own being bougie. I\u2019ve worked from home for over a decade; to say my social skills and ability to be around a lot of strangers has atrophied is a gross understatement.", "Nah, that's mean to 17 y/o's.\n\nThis is a toddler having a tantrum about having to take a bath rather than keep watching cartoons.", "Happy Anniversary to a couple who has figured it out. :)\n\nAfter reading this post today, I was thinking how grateful I am to have a good partner. When he sees a full laundry basket, he will always carry it up or down the stairs for me. When I started to change the bed sheets and duvet (so big and awkward on your own) he and the cat automatically helped me make the bed. Husband is kind enough not to chase the cat away when he is helping. LOL. When we were done the bed had a very large lump inside the duvet cover. :)  A good man is kind to animals too - even if he never owned a pet before in his life. \n\nLater my son said someone forgot their coffee. I heated it up and took it to husband's office. So very many little things every single day that tells us the other one cares for us. This is how it should be. You help and look after each other. This is a man I want to grow old with, when we really need to count on each other for help.", "That\u2019s what we do and we\u2019ve been at it for a bit over 10 years. I normally do all the cooking and groceries but my wife took care of me last weekend as I was down sick. \n\nThat said I\u2019m not surprised there are a lot of guys who don\u2019t know how to do groceries.", "Happy anniversary!!!! Your explanation is spot on.", "Exactly! My husband does the grocery shopping and sometimes a second trip if the store is missing something. As far as I know he hasn\u2019t had his manhood card revoked or whatever it is OP\u2019s husband is worried about", "Yep. I\u2019m pregnant right now, so my husband has taken over the Costco shopping for me because I\u2019m not allowed to lift over 25 pounds. He\u2019s also doing the litter box, and apart from calling our kitty \u201cpoop machine\u201d instead of his name, isn\u2019t complaining either. He also cooks, does his own laundry, and handles the cleaning service and lawn service as his parts of the mental load. They exist.", "This. My husband is the most incredible partner. But no one on Reddit wants to hear about that lol", "Agreed - I think I'm in a good marriage and my husband would NEVER act like this. I've never posted a relationship question because I just don't have to.", "Exactly! My husband does the dishes, laundry, picks our daughter up from school every day, runs tons of errands, etc. He\u2019s 100% a partner. Stories like OPs are so sad. Maybe more of us should be posting so people don\u2019t think terrible husbands are the norm!", "Amen!   \nMy partner of over 35 years, married for over 32, is amazing.    \nHe has become more caregiver than anything since I became ill a few years ago.  He has learned how to cook, although he would rather not because he struggles with timing.  But he WILL do it.\n\nHe is happy to do laundry, do the grocery shopping (he prefers I make him a list and be specific about what I want, including brand and size). \n\nHe would rather not do lawn care, because of allergies.  So his motto has become, \u201ccan we hire someone for that?\u201d", "Agree.  My husband wouldn't still be my husband if he had responded to me like that over such a trivial thing as grocery shopping.  Then again, OP and her husband also have everything separated financially, and that is another great way to keep \"score\" in a relationship. Keeping score only damages a relationship.", "That was very believable, you deserve an Oscar", "Ahh yes. Me, a heterosexual woman, who is heterophobic (not a thing by the way) \n\nwtf are you going on about?? (Rhetorical, for the love of god dont speak anymore, i wont respond anyway)\n\nEdit: nvm, just saw ur username. That tracks", "Every major grocery store has curbside pickup", "Good training on the cat. Mine just stares at me quizzically when I change bedsheets\u2026.", "Right? My husband and I both shop, cook and clean as needed based on what we feel like and our work schedules for the week, because we're both functioning adults who understand what needs to be done. We're two partners, not a servant and a master.", "I do! I\u2019m glad for you and the others who have lovely partners.", "Mine too! He\u2019s so thoughtful and considerate. I am very picky with all chores and he goes out of his way to master how to do the chores my way. He doesn\u2019t get it 100% but he tries and I appreciate it. \n\nEvery time I read about these posts on AITA or relationships advice, I tell him and he cannot believe men like OP\u2019s are real. He thinks all husbands must love their wives and are equal partners\u2026so these stories must be fake. \n\nMy MIL is the luckiest woman alive\u2026SAHM (kids moved out 20 years ago), does not cook, grocery shop or clean. My FIL does everything. She gets $1k/month spending money to do whatever she wants. Although it grinds me of the small things she complains about her husband (forgetting to lock the door when he comes home or her forgets to turn off the oven when he takes the dinner out).", "Same. My husband is amazing. I'm currently in school for anesthesia full-time. I can't really work while I'm in school so we're relying on his income. And with school taking up so much of my time, he's taken over the grocery shopping, kitty litterbox cleanup, laundry and cleaning around the house. I'm forever grateful for him, but yes Reddit doesn't care about the good stuff lol", "Same. I literally asked my husband to roll the trash to the street tonight (I've been coughing and didn't want to aggravate it), didn't explain and he just said OK and did it. He didn't even ask why.", "Lol what a clown.\n\nYes there are zero good men and every poor straight married woman in the world should be pitied for having to deal with a man. Oh also, there a zero dogshit women in the world.\n\n>heterophobic (not a thing by the way)\n\nAre you one of those morons that maintains black people can't be racist, too?", "He tries,  but he has trouble holding his end of the sheets. Most he just sits in the middle, pounces and looks cute. Once the bed is nice and neat he will test it for several hours.", "Same! I think people (mainly women) NEED to hear about good men so they will have more context surrounding how these types of situations are not acceptable.", "Poor thing. He's got no thumbs, bless his heart."]}
