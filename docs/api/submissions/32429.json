{"id": 32429, "submission_id": "18bmsoa", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend that a guy kissed me forcibly?", "selftext": "So I (23f) was at a party two nights ago, I did invite my gf (23f) but she didn\u2019t want to come because she was \u201csick\u201d. Anyway I got to the party and there was a mix of people I did and did not know so I naturally drifted to a group of people I did know one of those people was Shane (not his real name). We had known each other a few months but we weren\u2019t close. \nAnyway we were joking, drinking, dancing all that good stuff when Shane pulled me aside. He asked me why I had been looking at him like that all night. I asked. \u201cLooked like what?\u201d \u201cY\u2019know like you were interested in me.\u201d He smiled a creepy smile. \u201cNo clearly not and you know that I only like girls and that I have a girlfriend.\u201d He had a audacity to reply with. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to know.\u201d \u201cYou know that I\u2019m a lesbian so I only like girls.\u201d He rolled his eyes and sighed. \u201cThat a really old way to look at lesbians, lots of lesbians like guys now it\u2019s just changing times.\u201d \u201cNo lesbians that like guys are not lesbian, besides I only like girls!\u201d I started to raise my voice. And he asked me who traumatised me into only liking girls and I told him that no one did I was just born this way.\nHe said. \u201cOh really.\u201d Smirked and kissed me! I tried to pull away but he held tight it was torture. When he pulled away and asked me how it was I slapped him and stormed out, got in my car and left. As soon as I got home I told my gf what happened and she was furious I told her not to do anything wild (she\u2019s known for being a bit protective of me) but she did something anyway. She texted everyone that we knew that Shane had forced me to kiss him. Some people replied and some didn\u2019t but we went to bed never the less ready to deal with it in the morning.\nCome morning and my phone is flooded with texts some saying sorry that they didn\u2019t see and help, some saying anyway they could help. But Shane had also texted me saying that I shouldn\u2019t have said anything because he wasn\u2019t going to so why did I. \nHe also mentioned that his parents were mad with him and weren\u2019t giving him any money (He is 24 and comes from wealth and was heavily spoiled) because his parents learned from someone that they knew who\u2019s daughter was at the party.\nSo I haven\u2019t reaspond to Shane\u2019s texts and I think I know the answer but I must ask anyway.
