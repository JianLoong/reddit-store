The wedding dress is one of the most focal and to some people, important, parts of the wedding.

One set I made (sapphires, citrine, silver and gold seed pearls with a 3 carat sapphire pendant), would have retailed for well north of $2,500 - and the groom paid $300 for the materials at my cost.  \nYour friend likely understands that your finances are tight.

With that being said - there\u2019s a lot of entitled brides these days and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was upset.

I know how easy it is to not think what comes easy and is enjoyable to you is really valuable but there's a reason people pay others to do it. I always feel weird charging friends, especially when they pay for the materials, but my good friends usually insist because they want to support me too, even though it's never required by me. \n\nA quick Google search for the typical price of a handmade, custom wedding dress with multiple alterations will show you how much you're actually gifting. People pay tens of thousands of dollars for such dresses. Just because you don't work in a bridal salon with the title of official dressmaker doesn't mean that you don't have as much sewing experience as the people who do. Hell, look up custom wedding gowns on Etsy for the price other people charge. Some of those people probably consider themselves hobbyists too since they do this out of their homes.\n\nIf you really want to do something extra, I'd suggest taking any extra fabric and materials and maybe sewing a little stuffed animal or something the couple can display in their house out of them. The dress will be stored away after the ceremony, so having something small to set next to their wedding photo could be a sweet compromise if you really think you need a separate gift.", "NTA. A wedding dress is really expensive especially a hand made. It is a really nice gift. Your friend Abby might not know, how much work it is. And in the end it only matters what your friend the bride thinks and what you are confortable to give.", "NTA, you've given your friend an amazing gift that is totally unique, and something she'd never have without paying thousands of dollars. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if your friend already considers it your wedding present to her without you even mentioning it. Honestly it's so common for a friend or family member to make the wedding cake, or do the catering, flower arrangements etc etc and have that be their present. Tbh if your friend makes a fuss about it then I think that tells you all you need to know, but if she's a good friend then it probably won't even have crossed her mind that you would buy her another gift.", "NTA but this definitely should have been discussed with your friend prior to making the wedding dress. I used to do cake decorating as a hobby and made a lot of my friends/family wedding cakes but it was understood that was the gift from me.", "NTA, Abby is being weird, it's totally normal for something like that to count as 100% legit gift.

That's otherwise a lovely idea though thank you all the same! \n\nAnd my friend is as far from a bridezilla as I think it gets, I can't fathom her actually getting angry at me.

If someone who knew about this had asked me what I was getting them for their wedding gift, let alone had the temerity to suggest that I was cheaping out, I would have been furious. \n\nLuckily for me, I don't know anyone as shockingly oblivious as Abby. I'm no fashionista, but even I know that a custom wedding gown would cost more than a few hundred cookies, but just to help make my point: I don't habitually sell my cookies, but I do sometimes. Had I made those same cookies for an order, I probably would have charged something like $4-4.50 each; multiply that by 270 cookies and you get $1,080-1,215. (I also made a few hundred strips of candied of citrus peel \u2013 lemon, orange, and grapefruit \u2013 and dipped them in chocolate; I have no idea what I would have charged for that, but it probably at least $100, quite possibly more.)\n\nAbby is an idiot and an AH, while OP is obviously, definitely, absolutely, positively NTA. At all.", "this woman is not your friend.  She is using you for free labour.  A friend wouldn't even think that a further gift could be mentioned\n\nNTA", "NTA... It is easier to give money of paid gift then spend hours on a handcrafted gift. \n\nMaybe I am prejudice but I am a photographer and have save friends thousands of dollars on doing wedding photos. And it easily takes 50-100 hours of work. I will often send a gift of my favorite photo done in a special way later. (I would much prefer to spend money on buying something off the registry, and enjoy the event)", "NTA \"Abby\" is the AH!! She has no concept of what all is involved in sewing, much less a wedding dress. I have made wedding dresses (as a hobbyist\"). With all of the alterations and fitting, it is very time consuming, not to mention stressful working with very expensive fabric and trims. Abby needs to keep her nose out of your business", "NTA-I can\u2019t think of a more beautiful and heartfelt gift.", "NTA. Even if she paid for the material. Truthfully I'm surprised she didn't offer payment and odds are she probably assumes it's your gift.", "NTA.\n\nThey may have paid for materials\u2026 but they did NOT pay for your design work, time and labor!!!  *That* is an important part of the gift!\n\nIf bespoke clothing were only priced for cost of materials, custom suits and wedding dresses would be maybe 1/4th the price!!!", "How is Abby using me for free labor? Or do you mean the bride? Sorry I'm just a tad confused", "OP, I give a \u201ctalent related\u201d gift at my sibling\u2019s weddings, and I usually write in the card \u201ccongratulations, please consider (my contribution to wedding) as my gift to you! It was truly my pleasure to be a part of your day!\u201d \n\nThen there\u2019s no ambiguity about whether or not they\u2019ll be getting a bill later and whether or not I\u2019ll be sending an additional gift, lol.", "Yeah, man. That aunt was pure trash.", "Wrapping the dress is a great idea!! I was thinking putting together a very simple scrap book of any pics you took of the process, bride fittings, etc could be something tangible for the bride to open and make it clear but the dress itself makes sense.", "I just did the inflation calculations for my own wedding dress. CPI says $496.61.", "NTA. The time and care you've put into this dress is such a beautiful gift. \n\nAnd if Abby ever gets married? Don't agree to make anything for her, because you know she is also expecting a gift from her registry.", "NTA You've provided a truly thoughtful and unique gift for your friend. Be sure to take many photos of the dress and all the details.  You have a specialized talent that you can enjoy for many years to come.", "NTA", "NTA. The material is only a small part of the dress. Your labor is worth a ton. You do not owe her a gift.", "This, but, OP, I would make sure to text your friend, or MENTION it, \"I can't wait for you to pick up your wedding gift, you looked absolutely beautiful in it!\" If your friend is a normal person, she would have expected that. If not, you should see your friend for who she was.", ">She got upset with me and called me a heartless penny pincher. \n\nAlso, what? No friend of mine would ever say something like that to me even if they thought I was being cheap, that's so strange. \n\nNTA, OP, this is an amazing gift, making her a dream dress.", "Charge at least $20.00 per hour. I sew and most people can\u2019t make a wedding dress!!! Don\u2019t under value yourself. That is lots of work. You ABSOLUTELY can call the labor your gift. It is an amazing  gift too.", "Write a nice card/letter-take some time to do a rough copy first and plan it out.\n\nnot to give extra work - could you make a mini (simplified?) version of her dress maybe to fit a barbie (cute if she wants kids)\n\nPerhaps a keepsake out of any scraps from her dress. Something small to go in a memories box.\n\nDid you draw out the design for her dress? Perhaps you could sketch out her dress. Depending on your artistic abilities, there are lots of versions that would look great. You could even take a photo of her in the dress and trace the outline. Even the original sketch annotated could be lovely.\nLike [this](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1346810437/custom-wedding-dress-sketch), or [this](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1357963806/black-ink-wedding-dress-portrait-custom)or [this](https://www.vandaimages.com/2007BM8870-Sketch-of-a-model-in-haute-couture-fashions-with.html). find a nice frame in a second-hand shop.\n\nOr perhaps a hand embroidery line art of her dress (if within your abilities and time frame). Her dress outline on dress material scrap ??\n\nWith a little thought Im sure you could come up with something perfect for her that wouldn't cost much and (or maybe anything) wouldnt take much of your tkme and would be meaningful.", "Where I am from dressmakers take 30-35 \u20ac/hour. How many hours did you put into the dress?", "I honestly stopped counting haha it took 3 months start to finish with me working on it after work or on my days off pretty consistently. I went suuuuper slow as I wanted to avoid common mistakes like twisted fabric or uneven layers. \n\nId say anywhere between 80-100 hours easy but I can't say exactly how long. I was only considering charging her for 40 hours when I was considering it at all", "Well that's at least 1200 \u20ac worth of your time so maybe your other friend can politely shut the fuck up", ">so maybe your other friend can politely shut the fuck up\n\nI won't lie the way you politely stated that made me laugh. Thanks!"]}
