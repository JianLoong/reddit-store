The wedding dress is one of the most focal and to some people, important, parts of the wedding.

One set I made (sapphires, citrine, silver and gold seed pearls with a 3 carat sapphire pendant), would have retailed for well north of $2,500 - and the groom paid $300 for the materials at my cost.  \nYour friend likely understands that your finances are tight.

With that being said - there\u2019s a lot of entitled brides these days and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was upset.

I know how easy it is to not think what comes easy and is enjoyable to you is really valuable but there's a reason people pay others to do it. I always feel weird charging friends, especially when they pay for the materials, but my good friends usually insist because they want to support me too, even though it's never required by me. \n\nA quick Google search for the typical price of a handmade, custom wedding dress with multiple alterations will show you how much you're actually gifting. People pay tens of thousands of dollars for such dresses. Just because you don't work in a bridal salon with the title of official dressmaker doesn't mean that you don't have as much sewing experience as the people who do. Hell, look up custom wedding gowns on Etsy for the price other people charge. Some of those people probably consider themselves hobbyists too since they do this out of their homes.\n\nIf you really want to do something extra, I'd suggest taking any extra fabric and materials and maybe sewing a little stuffed animal or something the couple can display in their house out of them. The dress will be stored away after the ceremony, so having something small to set next to their wedding photo could be a sweet compromise if you really think you need a separate gift.", "NTA. A wedding dress is really expensive especially a hand made. It is a really nice gift. Your friend Abby might not know, how much work it is. And in the end it only matters what your friend the bride thinks and what you are confortable to give.", "NTA, you've given your friend an amazing gift that is totally unique, and something she'd never have without paying thousands of dollars. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if your friend already considers it your wedding present to her without you even mentioning it. Honestly it's so common for a friend or family member to make the wedding cake, or do the catering, flower arrangements etc etc and have that be their present. Tbh if your friend makes a fuss about it then I think that tells you all you need to know, but if she's a good friend then it probably won't even have crossed her mind that you would buy her another gift.", "NTA but this definitely should have been discussed with your friend prior to making the wedding dress. I used to do cake decorating as a hobby and made a lot of my friends/family wedding cakes but it was understood that was the gift from me.", "NTA, Abby is being weird, it's totally normal for something like that to count as 100% legit gift.

That's otherwise a lovely idea though thank you all the same! \n\nAnd my friend is as far from a bridezilla as I think it gets, I can't fathom her actually getting angry at me.

I personally wouldn't worry about it.", "I find it awkward to just say things like this out loud too, so I'd probably give her a card that says in it how honored I felt when she asked me to help with her dress, and how lucky I will feel when I watch her walk down the aisle wearing my wedding gift to her. Not many people get to share such a bond with their friends.", "I would venture to guess that this will be the ONE wedding gift they will continue to talk about anytime the wedding is discussed.  Be proud.  Be comfortable.  Be confident.", ">She paid for the ingredients and gave her time.\n\nSee that's what trips me up in my mind. I didn't pay for the \"ingredients\" I only gave my time. If I had bought the materials I'd have no second thoughts, but is it still reasonable to expect it be taken as a gift when the bride paid for everything and I just worked on it?", "Lol, good but *don\u2019t* use the word *only*.", "OP, THAT is beautiful and exactly how to say it!", "Your TIME and SKILl is valuable.  \n\n\nConsider this. If you were to make this dress for a stranger, how much would you charge?", "OP, look at it this way - bride got exactly what she wanted and by paying for the material ($$) got a couture dress ($$$$) for the cost of a couple of dinners out ($).", "NTA\nDoes your friend think other seamstresses would only charge for materials and not their time???? She paid for materials but not the most expensive part so you are being extremely generous. \n\nGo find the going rate for a custom wedding dress and ask your friend if she's giving a thousand+ dollar gift, too. If not, they can stfu.", "NTA labor is the bulk of the cost for this stuff. Ever get auto body work done? I recently paid like $250 for some work. The part was like $65. The rest was labor ($130/hour) and taxes. \n\nBut this gave you a real good look at Abby. If she gets engaged and wants you to make her dress, turn her down. She will 100% expect a gift and trash you to everyone. Frankly I would rethink my friendship with her, since she clearly does not value your time or skill. \n\nYour time is your most valuable asset, OP. It is the one thing you can't make more of.", "NTA\n\nWhen I got married, a good friend of mine offered to make my dress as well as my husband's great kilt. I supplied the material, but she made a brilliant job. I paid for the dress construction, but she did the kilt as a wedding present, and I couldn't have been happier.\n\nI would think gifting her all of your labour to make the dress of her dreams would be an amazing wedding present.", "NTA the wedding dress is a perfectly acceptable gift. That's a shit ton of work. Tell her how much the dress would have cost if it had been bought at a store then ask her how she is going to one up you.", "I married on an extremely tight budget.  As in my wedding cost me about $250 total.  And my pile of wedding gifts was pretty small, even though I had about 100 guests.  But there was a reason for that.  I have a ton of very talented friends.  One of whom made my dress for me.  I waited for a sale date, bought the fabric at a steep discount, and she custom fit my dress to me, making it from scratch.  If she had tried to gift me on top of that labor of love, I would have refused the gift.\n\n\nYour gift is your talent and time.  That's not cheap at all, but a very thoughtful and valuable gift \n\nNTA", "NTA. You should also take into account the time and effort you took to make the dress. It\u2019s not just cost. Gifting the wedding dress is absolutely fine.", "NTA.  But you run the risk of this friend feeling the same way as the other friend who thinks you're an AH.  The bride should have offered to pay you for your time in which case you could tell her this is her gift.  But she didn't.  I say NTA, the dress is a great gift!", "NTA. It might be a delicate conversation explaining your side, but a custom wedding dress is a HUGE gift and you shouldn't feel stingy for counting your labor as gifted value.", "Nta. She saved thousands of dollars and got a one of a kind dress handmade by a friend. That is a wonderful gift.", "NTA regardless. The value of the dress is far more than what most other people are giving as a gift.", "NTA- But here's a maybe solution- is there enough in offcuts to make a something small like a keepsake purse that can fix to the inside for her 'something old, something new etc' to go in, or a little pillow or a picture frame or covered box/journal/small photo album or similar? The dress will need to be carefully stored after so having something to keep on display made of the fabrics would be sweet as, especially if it's to contain wedding memories.", "NTA at all!! Your labor is enough of a gift.\n\nBUT I will say, if you want to give something extra, make it sentimental. Cost isn't the concern with gifts, the thought is (hence why your work is more than enough!)\n\nMaybe if there's leftover fabric, you could make a handkerchief or doily - a \"piece of her dress\" that she can use everyday so to speak. Or if you took photos of the process along the way (especially ones with your friend!), throw it together in a cute slideshow like a mini digital photo book. Add a note about how much you love your friend and your friendship, how excited you are to be a part of her big day. \n\nIF you give another gift, don't do it out of fear of money obligation. Give something else because you want to make her day extra special :)", "OP, there\u2019s an Instagram account called canyousewthisforme (Can you sew this for me?) please read their posts and realize the value of not only your work but yourself <3", "NTA and get new friends, that one who insulted you is totally not your friend", "NTA as long as the bride knows and it's not just the time spent it's your abilities, your time worked into the dress that is the gift. A good friend of mine was a professional jeweler. when I got married she made the rings. I paid for the raw material and we discussed what my fianc\u00e9e and I wanted but it was her skill that made it come to life and that was her gift.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is ieasy: If she does not like your gift (the dress), keep the dress and givt her something else INSTEAD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour time certainly is a generous gift.", "By absolutely ANY definition, your time spent and your expertise in this project are a huge gift. Any dress where the materials cost hundreds, is going to be worth thousands. You're giving her a giant gift, and anyone who doesn't understand that is willfully blind. Abby is an AH here, but you are totally 100% NTA. \n\nAlso, Abby's opinion is pretty irrelevant. If the bride were mad at you, that would be a bigger issue (where you'd still be right), but this is just an outsider with a limited view of reality, weighing in where she doesn't below.", "NTA\n\nAnd if the bride turns out to have a problem, the problem isn't you.", "OOOOOOH I COULD MAKE A PHOTO ALBUM COVER EASILY thank you!! I appreciate the inspiration!!", "If OP isn\u2019t comfortable calculating professional rates, then their current hourly wage at their day job should be the MINIMUM they go for. And if that\u2019s only minimum wage, clearly after making a whole wedding dress, they can definitely get a better job.\n\nEdit: grammar", "Do you remember \u201cthe strawberry dress\u201d that got knocked off? The original was $10k. Your time is worth at least $75/hour.", "Ask your friend how she is going to one up you. $1,000 is not a crazy number for a wedding dress.", "Anybody could cut out pattern pieces and slap together a dress. It would look like crap, most likely. But they would still have earned that $160 you feel bad about. You're going above and beyond for this bride by making this dress exactly what she wants and what you've put into it is worth more than any other gift she's going to get. Your friend's an asshole, you are NTA.", "Don't feel bad. Artists and craftspeople regularly get their labor and time undervalued. Your labor is a generous gift. My wedding dress was on the cheaper end and it was still $1700 after alterations.", "The term is used for a concept where you refuse to give any information to someone. You don't tell them about your life or anything. I guess it's one step below \"low contact.\"", "My best guess is it's rhyming slang for block?", "You have no reason to feel weird - it's like me making the wedding cake. A custom made gown would have been out of reach for her, it was a very generous gift. You can still have that conversation with her, saying something like \"look, I want to make sure you know I intended the work on the dress to be your gift, I hope you're OK with that\" so everyone is clear. She may have already assumed that was the case. Or you can give a token gift letting her know most of your gift was free labor", "No problem- I think you're way in the right that the skill and effort making the dress is more than enough present, but this way you don't need to doubt yourself or deal with Snippy Misses like this other friend :)", "Good idea!", "For reference, the cheapest wedding dress I've ever seen was 3000 and it definitely was not hand made or customised or altered 3 times\n\nFor my wedding alterations alone were 1000 \n\nYou're an actual angel for doing this", "I'll do my best to keep this in mind T\u203fT thank you so much", "My sister's wedding dress cost a few hundred dollars from a bridal store so it was most definitely made by people making pennies an hour.\n\nIf OP's friend got a custom dress anywhere else, I would not be surprised if the base price was $1,000 and it went up from there.", "My gown was $400 (full price $1600 but I got a deal) and $400 alterations.", "The ingredients for a cake (maybe $100?) is a very different cost than the materials for a dress. Look at the relative averages - cakes are generally in the $500-1000 range these days while dresses are in the $1000-8000 range (for the same level of wedding). Cakes are also a 2-3 day process at most (by necessity of freshness), while a simple dress would be 2-3 weeks minimum.  \n\nI say this as a baker - the time and skill you have developed is worth much more than you think it is. Value yourself - no one else is going to. The nasty people calling you a penny pincher is the same person who would find something nasty to say in every situation.", "Imagine you\u2019re working for a couture designer and they bring you the material for a we\u2019d dress.  You work on it for months and had multiple fittings with the client.  Don\u2019t you expect to paid for the work?  Or was it a gift to the company because you didn\u2019t purchase the materials. Your friend does NOT have the skill to sew a dress.  Your gift is the time/labor.  Look at the average cost of a wedding dress and I bet your gift is one of the few most expensive ones\u2026You\u2019re a good friend.  I\u2019m a needlepointer and embroiderer.

Have fun at the wedding!", "It's one of the weird mindfucks of capitalism that we think money (essentially a stand-in for our labor so that we don't have to barter constantly) is in some vague sense worth \"more\" than the labor that we perform to earn it, which is compounded by the fact that nearly everyone is wildly underpaid for their labor.", "I know it might come off a little manipulative but it's meant to be factual.

I come from the ppl who would say it's *only* a ring from Tiffany lol."]}
