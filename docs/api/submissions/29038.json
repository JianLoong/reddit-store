Racial undertones aside, I would try to talk to someone who is aware of the full situation that can give you an objective assessment. Like, the kids can be trouble, and you just may not see it.  The fact that people think they are trouble because of their race is a completely separate issue. I would have done the same thing in your spot.  But i think it's worth a follow-up.

I will also say I grew up with one or another of my cousin\u2019s friends coming to pretty much every family gathering, including sunday lunch with my grandparents. The friends were always seen as an extra cousin by all the kids and adults. They were fed, grilled about school, and forced to do chores. When another cousin was in college he brought home international students who weren\u2019t going home for christmas. We included them in gift exchanges and terrible mandatory singing. I send my childhood best friend\u2019s mom mother\u2019s day cards because that woman could have made a case to claim me on her taxes i was over her house so much. There is really no chance that this is not racist. Most families are glad to see their kids have close friendships and I know it\u2019s cheesy but the more the merrier is a saying for a reason.

A true Village.", "NTA\n\nBut I\u2019m going to offer a little different perspective. You were 100% right in regards to mom\u2019s BF. He was being a racist jerk. Sounds like your aunt is suspect as well. \n\nBut I really hate when non family is invited to family functions. Kids less than other adults cause, like in your son\u2019s case, sometimes it is nice to have someone around of the same age so the kid isn\u2019t bored out of their mind with nothing to do but listen to the adults. \n\nMy mom one time invited 2 or 3 of her clients (she was a home health aid at the time) to our family Thanksgiving celebration and it was very awkward. I found myself very resentful because my family had traveled, with kids, from Colorado to Iowa and having to spend my limited time with people I was either never going to see again or only see if she continued to invite them was frustrating when I wanted family time. \n\nMy SIL has done something similar. This was several years later, SIL (she and my brother aren\u2019t married but together for a long time so easier) has brought a friend to Thanksgiving for several years basically cause she and my mom don\u2019t get along. Which I get, but at the same time a) my daughter and I are aware of the dynamic and would be a buffer and b) SIL interacts almost exclusively with friend and we don\u2019t get to hang out and get to know her better. At that point why even come? And before people jump to conclusions no she isn\u2019t trying to avoid me too. She and I get along very well and she and my daughter get along fantastically (lots of similar interests and SIL is between my daughter and I age wise) the issues really are just her and my mom. \n\nSo for some people it isn\u2019t \u201cthe more the merrier\u201d. Some people can be intensely uncomfortable around people they don\u2019t know and if the boys primarily are hanging with each other it makes it so the rest of the family isn\u2019t going to get to know the boys to get over that discomfort AND they aren\u2019t getting to be with your son as much. Just some food for thought. The fact that none of your family who has an issue can articulate that idea though probably does mean this is more a race thing sadly.", "Wow. I\u2019m so sorry. You are NOT the ahole!", "Before my mom passed, everyone was welcome. All her friends, our friends, neighbors, etc. I don\u2019t think she would invite a random stranger but her friends and family friends.

By insisting that they are welcome, you are not abusing your power, or choosing them over your family. What you are doing, is choosing to not cater to prejudice. They want to remain prejudiced, but have any consequences come out of that prejudice. You were telling them that they can be prejudiced all they want, but that means that they either need to exclude themselves from holidays at your house, or shut up and be welcoming to these two boys.\n\nIf you want to give your niece and her mother the benefit of the doubt, even though I think this is a stretch given that they called their presence suspicious, then it may be possible that they are the kind of people that want to be pretty restrictive about holidays to just family and significant others. My mother was like this, so I know the type. They see family time in a very black and white context, and because these boys are not blood relatives, they are not family, and therefore should not always have an invitation. It\u2019s your house and your rules, but the frustration could also be that they don\u2019t get time to visit with your son on the holidays because he spending all of his time with his friends.

I had bunk beds, and we shared a room for the rest of the school year. When one of my little sisters friend and her were in high-school her and her mom were kick out be dad after mom did some not great thing and dad was mad but also refused to keep my sisters friend, his daughter, so mom and daughter were couch surfing with not great people and so she was neglected and my mom went nope and she came and stayed with us so she could get to school everyday, have food and an actual bed so she could really sleep. We kept her till her mom fixed her ways and got things fixed so they could go home, took months but no complaints from our family that matters and opinions we actual respect. We were very low income, especially when my sister stayed I worked to make money for things too but my would never turn a kid or person away needing help unless they proved themselves to be undeserving mainly her terrible brother and wife who she had help but they stole special health food needed for my special diet as it was better then what they had from the food bank, stole any medications they could get their hands on to get high or sell for drug and alcohol money, refused to pay the rent they were telling welfare they were paying my grandpa and mom, and they stole money from everyone in the house, and not a little I mean hundred for each person until they make the mistake of trying to steal from grandpa and he kicked them out, finally after years of their abusing everyone, they had even lied to the paramedics after my grandma unexpectedly passed away at home so they could get time alone with her body to strip all of her jewelry off so they could pawn it for more drug and alcohol money, even knowing and being reminded after that all her expensive rings and jewelry was to go to my mom in grandma's will, then lied about it and blamed the funeral home, who were nice enough to call us about the one peice they missed in their hast, because the funeral home wanted to make sure it got back to us safely, and the paramedic was also kind and told us the rings were there when he finished as he had to remove one during the resuscitation attempt but made sure to give it to family so it did not get lost once he was done and he had given it to my aunt, so definitely aunt and uncle. Hell even when she was alive they had stolen just under 800 dollars from her bank account in under 24 hours after bullying and pressuring her to give the pin with a sob story they needed money this second to go pay for a prescription for my Uncle or he would die of a seizure, which was untrue in any shape or form but grandma loved him so caved. They went to a bar and liquor store did not even go to the pharmacy at all, grandma found out from a bank statement afterwards the money was used at places she had never been and for this crazy amount. They tried to blame me who had been in school during a bunch of the purchases as they went back and forth to these two places all that day and into the night. Grandma, not knowing these places, thought the bank had made a mistake at first, but the bank said no and sent her to the police. Police got video of them using it at the liquor store and drinking in the bar, sadly grandma did not press charges as that would be too mean to her poor sick son, I tried to see if I could instead but nope, no video evidence of their terrible thefts in the house and I was just a highschooler so noting I could do, I tried but nope. With all that my mom has said p*ss off and will not help them ever and do not see them as family anymore, they have asked but it can be hard as they were banned from her work for stealing from the store, not when my mom was there thankfully so she kept her job but she totally could have lost it because of that, they still try to get in at times but are kicked out immediately. I refuse to acknowledge them in public or at home unless with my grandpa as he kicked them out, but it is his son, so he still cares, even after everything they did and still do. Uncle was found wandering alone drunk/high and confused and the police brought him here in the middle of the night in September grandpa let him stay over, I stayed up till he left to protect stuff but he even still stole from my grandpa upstairs, his brand new, unopened bottle of Tylenol not the bottle just the pills which grandpa sadly found out later that week when he had a toothache and went to take some. Anyway, yeah, blood is no choice but family, you can choose who you accept in it. My mom accepted mine and my sisters friends with open arms, whereas aunt and uncle are disowned to us.

My gram went even further and several of my sisters ex's still thought of her as gram and she had pictures of all of them on her grand kid wall (some of my older cousins practically pulled a \"he doesn't even go here\" when she bragged about her 'grandson' the doctor in a funny way.)\n\nWhen my gram passed her pallbearers were all of us grand kids so her 12 genetic ones and like 8 adopted ones which probably confused everyone with it being 9 white people 3 Hispanic people, 4 black people, 1 Muslim man, and 3 mixed people but she loved all of us", "And I\u2019m giving the \u201cabsolute legend\u201d award to the boy who told the racist bf \u201cdamn you caught us\u201d.", "racists think nobody else deserves to have nice things. it's disgustingly commonplace.", "That doesn't work when the troublemaker was mom's new BF.", "I agree.
