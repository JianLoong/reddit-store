There\u2019s a lot going on after a wedding, so it\u2019s possible they didn\u2019t see your message the following day or were busy and forgot to reply. Also, who asks for a gift repeatedly? Lots of cringe here.", "YTA\n\nYou reached out to them the day after their wedding.  They were on their honeymoon!  And probably dealing with a lot of follow up to their wedding.  Having returning a phone call slip through the cracks, under those circumstances, isn't rudeness, it's just a human mistake. \n\nAnd it's their gift.  You attended their wedding.  Give it to them.

Weddings are expensive, the least you can do is give them a gift", "YTA because you attended the wedding, and there's an unspoken rule that you pay for your plate with a gift.\n\nAlso, you need to cut them some slack for taking time to get back to you.

Next time either order a gift from the registry, or ask a them/relative what the address is and send it there. Bringing physical gifts to a wedding is now considered poor etiquette because the bride/groom might not have space to bring gifts home. \n\nAlso they probably didn\u2019t text back the day after the wedding because they were busy with family or wedding stuff.
