I bought them a pizza to eat and was overwhelmed by the smell of 10/11 yo boy armpits. \n\nI told them to go put deodorant on and they said okay. I checked in with them a few minutes later and they still hadn't washed up. At that point they started to push back that they didn't need it because they already put some on last night. I said whatever deodorant they put on last night had gotten washed off at the pool and you all spent the last hours running around in warm weather. I told them again to put some on.\n\nThey still didn't put any on so I turned off their video game. Apparently they were just about to pass a difficult level before I turned it off and were very upset with me. My son later told me that I embarrassed him. I told him that I handled it the way that I did because I wasn't getting their attention.", "created_utc": 1688209385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nsbfu/aita_for_turning_off_a_video_game_that_my_son_and/", "score": 1009, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Deodorant on top of funk is not better hehe", "YTA - they are kids, they do this sort of thing. You definitely embarrassed your son in front of his friends for a relatively minor issue.\n\nI will say it is a lesson they needed to learn. Being smelly as an adult is embarrassing, good to teach kids hygiene is important.", "YTA. Kids smell. You can tell your son to put deodorant on IN PRIVATE, but you have no right to enforce anything on his friends.\n\nIf you expect prepubescent and pubescent boys to smell good, skip any of them coming over to yours for the next 5-7 years.", "YTA - Do you immediately get up and do things that people ask you to? I know I don\u2019t. I wrap up whatever I\u2019m doing and then may go do what I was asked. Teens are still people not little robots to immediately do your bidding. You could have allowed time for them to wrap up their level.", "YTA\nFirstly, deodorant won't take away the smell, they'd need to wash so your instructions weren't very clear\nSecond, you could have threatened switching off the game to get them moving, switching off without letting them save their progess was definitely an AH move, I would never dream of doing that. I have said imy 11yo \"I'll switch it off then\" to get him moving though", "YTA. Pre-teen and teen boys smell \u2014 even with deodorant! You did embarrass him in front of his friends and pretty sure those boys will not want to be spending time at your house anymore because you THAT mom now. You could have handled it better or not at all because you don\u2019t control other peoples bodies, especially those who aren\u2019t even your own children.", "When I was younger my mom thought I wasn\u2019t coming to dinner fast enough (had to get to a save point because 90s) so she unplugged my PlayStation which ended up corrupting my memory card. I love my mom but like 30ish years later I haven\u2019t forgotten and I haven\u2019t forgiven. YTA", "YTA. Expecting the kids to jump when you say jump when they are engrossed in something they are enjoying is unreasonable - especially for something very minor. Better would be to ask them when a good stopping point is, and then get their compliance once they reach it.\n\nTurning the game off because they didn\u2019t immediately comply is disrespectful, and if this is how you typically parent probably will lead to your child resenting you and rebelling against you as they grow up.\n\n\n(Editing to add: starting to think this is just a troll account. No one is this obtuse.)", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t expect kids to just drop everything and immediately do your bidding. Maybe next time give a time frame for doing something. For my teenage son who plays computer games that can\u2019t be paused at an instant, if I ask him to do something I\u2019ll say I expect it done by X time. Maybe try some patience next time.", ">At that point they started to push back that they didn't need it because they already put some on last night. \n\nYou know, they probably didn't actually mind putting some on once they had got to where they wanted in the game. They probably only pushed back because you started harassing them when they just told you that they would.\n\nPreteen boys are notoriously hard to keep clean but asking them repeatedly while they're in the middle of something they're working on is really not the way to go about it. You didn't give them respect so you lost their respect. Then to top it off you pulled the \"I'm the big boss\" button and went with what, to them, is the nuclear option of destroying their game. That's not going to make them think \"oh yeah, dad was probably right, we messed up\", it's going to make them think \"god dad is an asshole I'm never wearing deodorant again screw everything\".\n\nSo yeah, YTA, to them, but also to yourself because you have absolutely made your life harder by doing this.", "YTA. I feel like if he\u2019s embarrassed of you for a good reason. There\u2019s a lot worse things in life than a group of boys smelling while gaming. I really don\u2019t think you should have been so strict and impatient with them while they are having their fun. I hope his friends don\u2019t give him crap for your behavior.", "YTA\n\nI'm assuming you were not sitting next to them in the living room, seeing as you \"checked in ... later\"? If not, why do you care so much they use deodorant immediately? If it does not bother them then just leave them be and pull your son to the side at a good moment and/or address this issue later. To go as far as turning off the video game seems like an overreaction to something that was not an issue to the kids themselves and could have easily waited till a later moment. Instead of 1. ruining their game and 2. embarrassing your son.", "How would you react if you kid hung up your phone for you in the middle of your conversation, or turned off your movie just before the end? \n\nAnnoyed? Indignant? Outraged?\n\nWell, that's basically what you just did, because YTA.", "YTA. From what I understand you only gave them a few minutes to go wash and they were in the middle of a hard level. Its normal for kids to smell after playing, especially at that age. You also embarased him in front of his friends. I get that you wanted to teach them hygene but you coudve handled the situation better then closing the game.", "ESH. \nIf it wasn't an online game there is a pause button. I get the angst of keep playing and finishing a level. It the request was to do some chore or something else I would have sided with the kids. But a 30 seconds task is easily done.\n\nTurning off the kids game suddenly with no warning is an AH move. Threatening to turn it off it they didn't get up was perhaps the less bad move here", "Rather than arguing with them and/or turning off their game, you should have just walked through the room spraying some odor eliminating air freshener.     \n\nIt would have gotten your point across (that they stink), and probably helped with the smell even more than adding deodorant to already stinky bodies.    \n\nPlus it would have an added benefit because I'm sure that the boys wouldn't have wanted you \"hanging around\" in the same room as them so likely they would have listened quicker just to get rid of you.\n\nSoft YTA", "Why are you arguing with everyone? What\u2019s the point you\u2019re trying to make? If you are so sure that you are not the complete AH here then just delete the post and move on with your life. \n\nThis little bickering you\u2019re doing to puff out your chest and act like you know better than everyone is not working. Don\u2019t ask for opinions and then get all angry when it is given.\n\nYTA for that alone but also definitely for what you did to your son.", "This is a terrible place to ask this as the posters skew young, many still teenagers. Maybe ask a parenting sub?\n\nNTA. Turning off a video game is a totally reasonable response. I understand your son was frustrated but he and his friends do have to adhere to your rules and you have a right to enforce them.", "NTA, You told them to do something and they didnt do it? And it was a simple request. You treated them to pizza, video games and a pool. Why aren\u2019t kids respectful anymore its because parents let kids walk all over them. You did a low level response to them not listening. Way to be a parent.", "NTA he\u2019ll get over it. Hygiene is more important than that level they can just attempt at again", "YTA only because it didn\u2019t need to happen right then and there. Communication could have been better and maybe that\u2019s the lesson with your son. Hygiene is important, he should listen, but he could have expressed- hey dad- we\u2019re almost done with this level and then we will clean up. Similarly to you, hey guys- you all need to clean up because hygiene is important. When you\u2019re in a good stopping place please pause and go put on some deodorant.", "YTA. You picked a fight with your son and his friends. Keep this up and you're going to mess up your kids social life.", "YTA, you overreacted to relatively harmless situation, you embarrassed your son, you asked them to put on deodorant without them showering first - which won't actually accomplish anything, and you're arguing with everyone in the comments.", "YTA and a horrible parent. It was only a few minutes after your request before you decided to turn their game off and doing so in such a short time frame was wrong.", "NTA. If they want to come into your house, they can follow your rules about basic hygiene. Id have made them shower too.", "YTA they are 10 years old. It\u2019s what happens when you have friends round. I really feel for your son. What you did was totally embarrassing", "YTA and the way you're responding to helpful comments says you're a hardheaded one at that, who wanted to be told he was in the right.", "NTA- but could\u2019ve handled it better. I\u2019d probably ask \u201chey is this a pausable game?\u201d Sometimes they are sometimes they aren\u2019t. Patience is a virtue. As a parent as well as a kid. Another alternative? Tossing them the deodorant yourself. It takes 10 seconds to put on, and probably 10 seconds for you to find and toss it to them. \n\nBasically, I get you, but this could\u2019ve gone down so much less dramatically than it did if you adjusted your approach just a little bit.", "NTA. I have a 15 year old son. I understand 15 year old boys can smell, I used to be one. I was told my son a long time ago that it he smelled, needed a shower or deodorant or whatever, that I was going to tell him. Not to embarrass him but to save him from being embarrassed from going out stinky. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong here. You're trying to teach them good hygiene and they were being teenagers about it so there were consequences. It would've taken them less than 2 minutes to put on deodorant. Instead they decided to be difficult about it and make it an issue. This is good parenting.", "YTA and I feel bad for your kid. You have no empathy and clearly forget what it\u2019s like to be 10 and being embarrassed in front of friends. He will most likely leave at 18 and never look back if this is how you handle yourself.", "YTA - was it absolutely necessary to embarrass your kid in front of their friends? I assure you they will not want to come over again and you won\u2019t have to worry about stinky kids any longer.", "YTA for sure. Other ways to get their attention than that.", "YTA\n\nVideo games are usually not like a movie, where they can just pick up where they left off. \n\nThey were putting effort into accomplishing something together and you destroyed it because you are miffed about them going through puberty.", "YTA, if you had adult houseguests over that were your friends, and you didn't like how they smelled, would you have treated them the exact same way? or do you not respect your child's relationships", "YTA. We both know it wasn't about a 'smell'.\n\nIt was about power.\n\nYou getting off on kids obeying you and doing your bidding, and if they don't jump at the opportunity, your frail ego feels disrespected.\n\nSmall d energy.", "As per usual, everyone in the comments is on crack and expecting everyone to be perfect at all times. Doesn't it get exhausting? I would say NTA. You asked them about three separate times. Since when is it cool for kids, let alone anyone, to ignore an important request that impacts everyone.", "[removed]", "If they smell, they need to wash, then put on deodorant and clean clothes. Adding deodorant doesn\u2019t help.\nAnyway: you embarrassed your son & his friend.\nYTA", "Yta, I have a 9 and 11 yr old and if I want something done and they are playing video games I give them a warning to get to the next save point and do xyz.  Some games you can\u2019t exit immediately without losing progress.  You embarrassed your kid for something that could have waited a few more minutes.  Kids that age really do stink though, after my kids friends are over I have to air out our basement play space bc it smells like a locker room.", "Your personality in these comments is reflective of the consensus. You\u2019re experiencing a harsh cognitive dissonance because other people are more empathic and thoughtful of others than you. \n\nUnderstanding the effects of social interactions with kids and how it molds their brain for their adult life should be a given if you\u2019re going to be a parent. It\u2019s sad so many parents don\u2019t understand that and the children grow to have certain anxieties or varying degrees of trauma because the parent failed at their job. It\u2019s not about your smell is disturbing me, I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s teaching him hygiene between you and him, ALONE where he feels safe in learning. You are alienating yourself, especially if this is consistent with how you parent. Don\u2019t be surprised if he breaks contact with you as an adult if this is more encompassing than just this instance. \n\nYTA", "Meh, kind of a dick move but it's not the end of the world. All modern games auto save and really they could have paused it and followed your easy to accomplish task.\n\nI'll go with NTA and people are over reacting here in my opinion.", "My almost 10 yr old is becoming a stink monster. Never would I ever do this in front of his friends though.  I understand teaching them proper hygiene now but it wasn't so urgent you needed to make a scene. You should have let it go. YTA", "YTA I am not sure you can tell other people's kids to wear deodorants. It is a different thing to ask them to take a shower if they smell. but no products. btw deodorants that contain aluminum might be one source of breast cancer and they are definitely not suitable for people with metal allergy. probably you should also be aware what you force your son to wear.", "YTA.  You could've waited a few minutes for them to finish their game before asking them to put on deoderant.", "Policing other people\u2019s kids deodorant level is over the top.  Sometimes kids are a bit smelly.  Get over it.  Teach you own kids hygiene as you want, but don\u2019t be some weirdo pushing deodorant on other kids.\n\nYTA.  Relax, let kids be kids.", "You can\u2019t be serious.  If so, YTA.", "INFO did you tell them you where gonna turn the game off if they didn't apply deodorant?", "YTA - your punishment has no relation to their behavior. You punish all of them without knowing how is the stinker. You did not set a deadline or explained your problem.\n\nJust treat them like human beings", "YTA, as a kid under a \"you're not wrong, you're just an asshole\" parent, you haven't taught your son to listen to you, you've taught him to avoid you. Honestly though you *are* wrong, you crashed a one-night fun-time to play bad cop and punished your son in front of his friends, and punished his friends too. The grown-up thing would be to have a talk with your son after everyone left. As I said, though, the teaching moment has passed, and he'll just make sure to do fun things outside of your supervision from here on out.", "I can't believe people here thinking you are at fault, you gave your son some instructions and he ignored you, argued with you and carried on playing his game. Absolutely NTA and the people in the comments here are helping me understand why the world today is such a mess. \n\nHe embarrassed himself.", "NTA - I used to make all of my son\u2019s friends shower at sleepovers and their moms all thought I was this badass magician. Hygiene is extremely important and there\u2019s no reason why preteens shouldn\u2019t participate.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your place to tell other people\u2019s children what to do with their own bodies. You could have pulled your son aside and told him he needed to take a shower and put on deodorant, and then offered your shower to the other boys.", "NTA however you get a very slight YTA. You may have \"embarrassed\" him but he made the decision to ignore what you wanted them to do.\n\nEveryone arguing YTA are missing the point. Yes, you can say there was no need for them to jump immediately. That is fine. But they started arguing with him. THAT is the issue. He started disrespecting his father's wishes in front of his friends.\n\nI'm not sure what household people grew up in but there is a difference between being respectful to your parent and just disrespecting their wishes. They could have easily asked \"We would just like to finish this level if that's okay?\" or something along those lines. Also unless they were playing something that is online there is the pause button.\n\nThey are pre teens. Not toddlers. Yes you can give them some slack because they are having fun but arguing against doing it entirely is not something you reinforce and that's exactly what they started doing.", "10 years from now OP will be like \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t my son visit or talk to me?!\u201d Hmmm wonder why \ud83d\ude44 OP needs a reality check.

That is a disrespectful towards a friends parent. She is entitled to not want her living room stinking of boy sweat. Not one of them said \u201cwe will put it on in 10 mins once this game finishes\u201d instead they tried to get cocky and argue back. Boohoo their poor game got disturbed - what a hard life! Maybe next time they will show respect to an adult making a reasonable request. If you went to school in my area at age 11 smelling of sweat you\u2019d get bullied.", "Ngl that\u2019s pathetic, needy and counterproductive behaviour thats usually rooted in one\u2019s lack of acceptance or popularity as a child. There\u2019s nothing wrong with treating them nicely, but needing them to like you is dodgy behaviour - if you\u2019re in any way responsible for them your first priority should always be setting a good example. \n\nSome of the worst parenting that isn\u2019t intentionally abusive comes from trying to act like your kids best friend and not their parent.", "I think their house might become the main stage for teenage pranks. I would", "So OP should just bend over backwards to the whims of kids who\u2019ve barely developed any conception of social norms? Believe it or not, preteen kids can sometimes be in the wrong and in need of a harsh lesson (which this instance barely counts as, I suspect the fact that OP messed with their precious video game and admitted it on reddit of all places is a contributing factor to people here acting like he committed a war crime)", "Based on this very short passage I think this is a wild jump. Have a look in the mirror.", "100%\n\nIf the smell really was THAT bad, just spray some air freshner or light a candle which would mask the smell better than getting them to put deodrant on anyway.\n\nIf they have been outside getting sweaty, there's every possability the smell is coming from sweat and bacteria on their clothes just as much as it is their body, so spray on the armpits is just going to make the room smell of BO and body spray, which anyone who's been in a changing room as a kid after PE knows isn't a good mix.", "You're still obsessed with pokemon", "So what should he have done then when his son and the kids argued they didn't need it? Just accept they don't want it and leave them alone?\n\nAll that does is reinforce that if they argue they can do whatever they want.\n\nI genuinely do not understand why people are ignoring the fact that his son argued with him over it. The father didn't ask for anything unreasonable here. He didn't demand they do it then and there.", "If that\u2019s what you wanna argue. Okay. But that doesn\u2019t change what op meant. They implied pool is a shower and I\u2019m not the only one who understood it as that.", "All OP said was a few minutes later. Could have been less then 5 minutes. Best course would have been to ask them to pause the game; and if they said they were almost finished with that section to agree on a time limit. For example, ok if that level should be done is 10 minutes let\u2019s take a break at that point and get cleaned up and put on deodorant. If they still didn\u2019t at that point, then sure turn off the tv.", "Yeah and that might be a good break point too. That\u2019s why adults learn about the game, asking the kids questions. \u201cHey can you pause that game?\u201d Is a valid question and a good opportunity to give the kids direction before continuing the game.", "They are young kids, not even teens. They probably have zero self awareness of smelling", "Learning\u2026lesson. What other types of lessons are there?", "Yeah... as much as being an internet troll is bad, it really taught me how people think in terms of flaws and jumping to conclusions or omitting facts.\n\nChances are he is angry at his mom, but the power dynamic is fucked up so he can't express it to her and work through his emotions, so he either suppresses them and slowly stops talking to her, or he rewrites the narrative in his head that he and his friends were victims of his mom abusing her authority, which is half true. He will completely ignore that she asked him several times to clean up because he was distracted and honestly might not remember she asked. He will also ignore that he and his friends were dirty and smelly and causing problems for his mother in her own home, but he will focus on the fact that she doesn't understand gaming, doesn't understand him, is cruel just for the sake of being cruel, etc.", "Yeah, for the mom... but then her son learns that when authority abuses you instead of attempting to fall withing the authorities boundaries and rules he can just call her names to his friends, not change his behaviour, and go somewhere else. Where will he go?  where there is no authority to watch and make sure he is doing what he should be doing. Like cleaning himself once a day.\n\nThis is how you end up with kids who hate being in the house, disrespect authority figures, and constantly get into trouble because they can't trust their parents not to abuse the authority the parent has over the child.\n\nNow of course this is all over one interaction, but the sort of \"jump when I say jump\" combined with the lack of understanding about what her son and his friends were actually doing makes me think the mother doesn't care and just wants an obedient child. If she cared we likely would have gotten a description closer to \"my son and his friends were playing call of duty, and they had completed several matches between when I asked him to clean himself...\" or something like \"my son and his friends were playing a coop game on the playstation that they could pause at any time...\"\n\nBut she doesn't know what her son and the friends are doing, and coming from someone whose mom cared and learned what videogames were and what they entailed, (god damn i regretted teaching her the difference between online and offline) it sounds like this mom doesn't care about what her son is doing as long as he does what he is told, and thats terrible for the sons ability to trust authority in the future.", "They aren't going to remember the 3 times she asked them to clean themselves, that was likely a 15 minute exchange while they were severely distracted by their game and I guarantee you 100% not paying attention.\n\nI have adhd and I can have full conversations with people while I'm distracted and have to asked them to repeat themselves 5 minutes later because my brain didn't have enough capacity to form a memory with everything I was actively doing.\n\nThis is a similar thing, while playing they will be unaware that she asked them for anything even if they talk about it and argue it wont aink in unless they stop playing and actually pay attention. the moment they finish one of the boys will likely say \"didn't your mom say we should shower?\" Because its only then in that moment when the distractions gone that their brain can actually proccess what has been said to them. And the other will say \"oh shit she asked us a bunch we don't want to make her mad let's go\" \n\nBut she interrupted them like 5 minutes before this process happens naturally, and in such a cruel and unnecessary way. I actually have trauma (super super mild) from my dad flicking the house breaker to stop me playing videogames. And to this day I can't talk to him about any of my emotions, not just because I don't trust him (I didn't from age 12-21 and avoided him) but also because he never learned what I was doing or cared enough to learn he just wanted me to jump when he said jump and stop playing video games when he said stop.\n\nNow as an adult I have huge fucking problems trusting managers, bosses, other friends parents, police and authority figures in general. I just assume that, like my father, they don't care about who I am or what I'm doing they just want me to sit, roll over, and lie down like a dog.\n\nIs this the kind of mental scar you want this kid to have? Distrusting of parents and police? Or maybe since it's his mother instead of his father he will become a misogynist and start to mistrust and woman who is maternal and caring towards him, because like with his mother, at some point they are gonna want him to stop, or sit, or roll over and when he doesn't immediately do it is she gonna ruin whatever he is enjoying to get her way? \n\nSoft and sheltered my ass, I just know what the fuck I'm talking about and how authority figures abusing children even in small ways by humiliating them in front of their friends or other such negative actions taken for the sole purpose of tearing someone down is fucked up and will cause this kid so many problems later in life", "Or even handle them the deodorant, I doubt they'd refuse to put it if they have it on hand's reach.", "I don't see why you're trying to use that like an insult lol, Pokemon's cool", "Because none of these people have kids yet think they know how to parent", "Clearly you didn\u2019t read the comment where Op said he expected them to stop and do it right then.\nAnd he should have waited a reasonable amount of time for them to comply before bringing it up again. A few minutes is not a reasonable time frame.\nAlso children are not robots without feelings or opinions. It is old fashioned and wrong to say children shouldn\u2019t be able to express their opinion or should be punished for doing so. \nYou have your opinion and myself and others have ours. Accept that and move on", "Teaching lessons", "Turning off a game isn\u2019t abuse. Neither is not knowing the intricacies of what her child is playing, considering we have no idea how many other children she has, her job, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s funny how Reddit likes to rail against how children act in public, but you know how you get kids that don\u2019t act like that in public? By enforcing what you say. When I say stop, it means stop. When I say no, it means no. Are there age appropriate modifications to that? Of course, there\u2019s no need to police a preteen the same way you would a toddler. But for the most part, yeah, parents make the rules. I wouldn\u2019t have jumped to turning the game off myself, but I understand the impulse behind it. \n\nYou\u2019re not a parent, are you?", "Which are the exact same thing as \u201clearning lessons\u201d just from the POV of the person giving the lesson."]}
