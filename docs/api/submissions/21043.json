They had gone swimming and played at the park before coming back to my house to play video games in the living room. I bought them a pizza to eat and was overwhelmed by the smell of 10/11 yo boy armpits. \n\nI told them to go put deodorant on and they said okay. I checked in with them a few minutes later and they still hadn't washed up. At that point they started to push back that they didn't need it because they already put some on last night. I said whatever deodorant they put on last night had gotten washed off at the pool and you all spent the last hours running around in warm weather. I told them again to put some on.\n\nThey still didn't put any on so I turned off their video game. Apparently they were just about to pass a difficult level before I turned it off and were very upset with me. My son later told me that I embarrassed him. I told him that I handled it the way that I did because I wasn't getting their attention.", "created_utc": 1688209385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nsbfu/aita_for_turning_off_a_video_game_that_my_son_and/", "score": 7555, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Deodorant on top of funk is not better hehe", "YTA - they are kids, they do this sort of thing. You definitely embarrassed your son in front of his friends for a relatively minor issue.\n\nI will say it is a lesson they needed to learn. Being smelly as an adult is embarrassing, good to teach kids hygiene is important.", "YTA. Kids smell. You can tell your son to put deodorant on IN PRIVATE, but you have no right to enforce anything on his friends.\n\nIf you expect prepubescent and pubescent boys to smell good, skip any of them coming over to yours for the next 5-7 years.\n\nEdit: people complaining about manners obviously never learnt about the manners. HOST should have", "YTA - Do you immediately get up and do things that people ask you to? I know I don\u2019t. I wrap up whatever I\u2019m doing and then may go do what I was asked. Teens are still people not little robots to immediately do your bidding. You could have allowed time for them to wrap up their level.", "YTA\nFirstly, deodorant won't take away the smell, they'd need to wash so your instructions weren't very clear\nSecond, you could have threatened switching off the game to get them moving, switching off without letting them save their progess was definitely an AH move, I would never dream of doing that. I have said imy 11yo \"I'll switch it off then\" to get him moving though", "YTA. Pre-teen and teen boys smell \u2014 even with deodorant! You did embarrass him in front of his friends and pretty sure those boys will not want to be spending time at your house anymore because you THAT mom now. You could have handled it better or not at all because you don\u2019t control other peoples bodies, especially those who aren\u2019t even your own children.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Expecting the kids to jump when you say jump when they are engrossed in something they are enjoying is unreasonable - especially for something very minor. Better would be to ask them when a good stopping point is, and then get their compliance once they reach it.\n\nTurning the game off because they didn\u2019t immediately comply is disrespectful, and if this is how you typically parent probably will lead to your child resenting you and rebelling against you as they grow up.\n\n\n(Editing to add: starting to think this is just a troll account. No one is this obtuse.)", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t expect kids to just drop everything and immediately do your bidding. Maybe next time give a time frame for doing something. For my teenage son who plays computer games that can\u2019t be paused at an instant, if I ask him to do something I\u2019ll say I expect it done by X time. Maybe try some patience next time.", ">At that point they started to push back that they didn't need it because they already put some on last night. \n\nYou know, they probably didn't actually mind putting some on once they had got to where they wanted in the game. They probably only pushed back because you started harassing them when they just told you that they would.\n\nPreteen boys are notoriously hard to keep clean but asking them repeatedly while they're in the middle of something they're working on is really not the way to go about it. You didn't give them respect so you lost their respect. Then to top it off you pulled the \"I'm the big boss\" button and went with what, to them, is the nuclear option of destroying their game. That's not going to make them think \"oh yeah, dad was probably right, we messed up\", it's going to make them think \"god dad is an asshole I'm never wearing deodorant again screw everything\".\n\nSo yeah, YTA, to them, but also to yourself because you have absolutely made your life harder by doing this.", "YTA. I feel like if he\u2019s embarrassed of you for a good reason. There\u2019s a lot worse things in life than a group of boys smelling while gaming. I really don\u2019t think you should have been so strict and impatient with them while they are having their fun. I hope his friends don\u2019t give him crap for your behavior.", "YTA\n\nI'm assuming you were not sitting next to them in the living room, seeing as you \"checked in ... later\"? If not, why do you care so much they use deodorant immediately? If it does not bother them then just leave them be and pull your son to the side at a good moment and/or address this issue later. To go as far as turning off the video game seems like an overreaction to something that was not an issue to the kids themselves and could have easily waited till a later moment. Instead of 1. ruining their game and 2. embarrassing your son.", "How would you react if you kid hung up your phone for you in the middle of your conversation, or turned off your movie just before the end? \n\nAnnoyed? Indignant? Outraged?\n\nWell, that's basically what you just did, because YTA.", "YTA. From what I understand you only gave them a few minutes to go wash and they were in the middle of a hard level. Its normal for kids to smell after playing, especially at that age. You also embarased him in front of his friends. I get that you wanted to teach them hygene but you coudve handled the situation better then closing the game.", "ESH. \nIf it wasn't an online game there is a pause button. I get the angst of keep playing and finishing a level. It the request was to do some chore or something else I would have sided with the kids. But a 30 seconds task is easily done.\n\nTurning off the kids game suddenly with no warning is an AH move. Threatening to turn it off it they didn't get up was perhaps the less bad move here", "Rather than arguing with them and/or turning off their game, you should have just walked through the room spraying some odor eliminating air freshener.     \n\nIt would have gotten your point across (that they stink), and probably helped with the smell even more than adding deodorant to already stinky bodies.    \n\nPlus it would have an added benefit because I'm sure that the boys wouldn't have wanted you \"hanging around\" in the same room as them so likely they would have listened quicker just to get rid of you.\n\nSoft YTA", "Why are you arguing with everyone? What\u2019s the point you\u2019re trying to make? If you are so sure that you are not the complete AH here then just delete the post and move on with your life. \n\nThis little bickering you\u2019re doing to puff out your chest and act like you know better than everyone is not working. Don\u2019t ask for opinions and then get all angry when it is given.\n\nYTA for that alone but also definitely for what you did to your son.", "This is a terrible place to ask this as the posters skew young, many still teenagers. Maybe ask a parenting sub?\n\nNTA. Turning off a video game is a totally reasonable response. I understand your son was frustrated but he and his friends do have to adhere to your rules and you have a right to enforce them.", "NTA, You told them to do something and they didnt do it? And it was a simple request. You treated them to pizza, video games and a pool. Why aren\u2019t kids respectful anymore its because parents let kids walk all over them. You did a low level response to them not listening. Way to be a parent.", "NTA he\u2019ll get over it. Hygiene is more important than that level they can just attempt at again", "YTA only because it didn\u2019t need to happen right then and there. Communication could have been better and maybe that\u2019s the lesson with your son. Hygiene is important, he should listen, but he could have expressed- hey dad- we\u2019re almost done with this level and then we will clean up. Similarly to you, hey guys- you all need to clean up because hygiene is important. When you\u2019re in a good stopping place please pause and go put on some deodorant.", "YTA. You picked a fight with your son and his friends. Keep this up and you're going to mess up your kids social life.", "YTA, you overreacted to relatively harmless situation, you embarrassed your son, you asked them to put on deodorant without them showering first - which won't actually accomplish anything, and you're arguing with everyone in the comments.", "YTA and a horrible parent. It was only a few minutes after your request before you decided to turn their game off and doing so in such a short time frame was wrong.", "NTA. If they want to come into your house, they can follow your rules about basic hygiene. Id have made them shower too.", "YTA they are 10 years old. It\u2019s what happens when you have friends round. I really feel for your son. What you did was totally embarrassing", "YTA and the way you're responding to helpful comments says you're a hardheaded one at that, who wanted to be told he was in the right.", "NTA- but could\u2019ve handled it better. I\u2019d probably ask \u201chey is this a pausable game?\u201d Sometimes they are sometimes they aren\u2019t. Patience is a virtue. As a parent as well as a kid. Another alternative? Tossing them the deodorant yourself. It takes 10 seconds to put on, and probably 10 seconds for you to find and toss it to them. \n\nBasically, I get you, but this could\u2019ve gone down so much less dramatically than it did if you adjusted your approach just a little bit.", "NTA. I have a 15 year old son. I understand 15 year old boys can smell, I used to be one. I told my son a long time ago that it he smelled, needed a shower or deodorant or whatever, that I was going to tell him. Not to embarrass him but to save him from being embarrassed from going out stinky. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong here. You're trying to teach them good hygiene and they were being teenagers about it so there were consequences. It would've taken them less than 2 minutes to put on deodorant. Instead they decided to be difficult about it and make it an issue. This is good parenting.", "YTA and I feel bad for your kid. You have no empathy and clearly forget what it\u2019s like to be 10 and being embarrassed in front of friends. He will most likely leave at 18 and never look back if this is how you handle yourself.", "YTA - was it absolutely necessary to embarrass your kid in front of their friends? I assure you they will not want to come over again and you won\u2019t have to worry about stinky kids any longer.", "YTA for sure. Other ways to get their attention than that.", "YTA\n\nVideo games are usually not like a movie, where they can just pick up where they left off. \n\nThey were putting effort into accomplishing something together and you destroyed it because you are miffed about them going through puberty.", "YTA, if you had adult houseguests over that were your friends, and you didn't like how they smelled, would you have treated them the exact same way? or do you not respect your child's relationships", "YTA. We both know it wasn't about a 'smell'.\n\nIt was about power.\n\nYou getting off on kids obeying you and doing your bidding, and if they don't jump at the opportunity, your frail ego feels disrespected.\n\nSmall d energy.", "As per usual, everyone in the comments is on crack and expecting everyone to be perfect at all times. Doesn't it get exhausting? I would say NTA. You asked them about three separate times. Since when is it cool for kids, let alone anyone, to ignore an important request that impacts everyone.\n\nEdit: Also, it's a video game. Chances are they could have paused.", "INFO : your wife has already left you, right?", "If they smell, they need to wash, then put on deodorant and clean clothes. Adding deodorant doesn\u2019t help.\nAnyway: you embarrassed your son & his friend.\nYTA", "Yta, I have a 9 and 11 yr old and if I want something done and they are playing video games I give them a warning to get to the next save point and do xyz.  Some games you can\u2019t exit immediately without losing progress.  You embarrassed your kid for something that could have waited a few more minutes.  Kids that age really do stink though, after my kids friends are over I have to air out our basement play space bc it smells like a locker room.", "Your personality in these comments is reflective of the consensus. You\u2019re experiencing a harsh cognitive dissonance because other people are more empathic and thoughtful of others than you. \n\nUnderstanding the effects of social interactions with kids and how it molds their brain for their adult life should be a given if you\u2019re going to be a parent. It\u2019s sad so many parents don\u2019t understand that and the children grow to have certain anxieties or varying degrees of trauma because the parent failed at their job. It\u2019s not about your smell is disturbing me, I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s teaching him hygiene between you and him, ALONE where he feels safe in learning. You are alienating yourself, especially if this is consistent with how you parent. Don\u2019t be surprised if he breaks contact with you as an adult if this is more encompassing than just this instance. \n\nYTA", "Meh, kind of a dick move but it's not the end of the world.

It is a different thing to ask them to take a shower if they smell. but no products. btw deodorants that contain aluminum might be one source of breast cancer and they are definitely not suitable for people with metal allergy. probably you should also be aware what you force your son to wear.", "YTA.  You could've waited a few minutes for them to finish their game before asking them to put on deoderant.", "Policing other people\u2019s kids deodorant level is over the top.

Honestly though you *are* wrong, you crashed a one-night fun-time to play bad cop and punished your son in front of his friends, and punished his friends too. The grown-up thing would be to have a talk with your son after everyone left.

Absolutely NTA and the people in the comments here are helping me understand why the world today is such a mess. \n\nHe embarrassed himself.", "NTA - I used to make all of my son\u2019s friends shower at sleepovers and their moms all thought I was this badass magician. Hygiene is extremely important and there\u2019s no reason why preteens shouldn\u2019t participate.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your place to tell other people\u2019s children what to do with their own bodies.

You may have \"embarrassed\" him but he made the decision to ignore what you wanted them to do.\n\nEveryone arguing YTA are missing the point. Yes, you can say there was no need for them to jump immediately. That is fine. But they started arguing with him. THAT is the issue. He started disrespecting his father's wishes in front of his friends.\n\nI'm not sure what household people grew up in but there is a difference between being respectful to your parent and just disrespecting their wishes. They could have easily asked \"We would just like to finish this level if that's okay?\" or something along those lines. Also unless they were playing something that is online there is the pause button.\n\nThey are pre teens. Not toddlers.

And the other will say \"oh shit she asked us a bunch we don't want to make her mad let's go\" \n\nBut she interrupted them like 5 minutes before this process happens naturally, and in such a cruel and unnecessary way.

Adding it to existing bacteria won't make it go away, a shower is needed for that. The respect aspect of child to parent is relevant though, not whether they will stop smelling.\n\nIf I give one of the boys instructions to do something, and he is engrossed, I make sure he acknowledges hearing me (this is important). I will use his name to get his attention, especially if I don't get a response the first time. My boys know they may ask, \"may I finish the level\" or something similar, and I'll ask how long and determine if that is acceptable. If I give him time to finish, and it isn't done when we discussed, I will remind him. Sometimes I get preoccupied and forget, and have a similar expectation of them. If they fail to get it done, the video game being turned off will be a consequence of their failure. I'd probably let them save or pause unless they start an argument. Notice that we can talk about terms, and agree on those, but we aren't going to argue. The request is the warning that there will be consequences, and we've tried very hard to keep consequences related to and in parity with the actions.\n\nI would have less patience if one of them argued with my wife/their mother.

It's way less mortifying to be called out by a friend's mom at their house than, say, by a group of girls at school who will laugh about it until they graduate. \"They put deodorant on yesterday.\" Yesterday? Come on, man, that's nasty. Showers and deodorant are daily, not just whenever you feel like it. Especially at that age when hormones have them smelling extra fermented. \n\nThat's not even touching on the fact they told you \"no\" in your own house. You couldn't have paid me to tell a friend's mom \"no\" when I was a kid. Hell, to this day fully grown and in my 30s, I *still* will not tell someone \"no\" in their own house. If it comes to that, I just leave. There's a certain degree of respect that's expected when you're a guest in someone else's home, and these kids' parents aren't teaching them shit. Good on you for standing your ground and teaching them that normal people don't want to be around stinky people.
