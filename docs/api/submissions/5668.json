She was very sick for awhile but when she caught COVID - it was over. I faced a similar situation as yourself. My mother did not want life support, wanted cremation, did not want a viewing or a large ceremony, and wanted her ashes scattered on a lake. I knew this.\n\nMy grandmother wanted machines to keep her \u201calive\u201d as long as possible despite her condition being terminal, and did NOT agree with me giving them the OK to pull the plug and ease her pain quickly. She did NOT agree to mom being cremated and scattered and wanted a formal service. Wanted all her ashes, too.\n\nAnd much like you, as her proxy, I did what my MOM wanted. My grandmother didn\u2019t like it, and I remember the pastor as he prayed over my mom\u2019s bed stating that he hoped this brought my grandmother and I closer together to heal, but if he only knew\u2026 my grandma absolutely hated my decision to follow mom\u2019s wishes. When I had her cremated and picked out the urn and scattered her, I did it behind my grandmothers back because she would make the situation much more complicated. \n\nUnfortunately, the complex dynamics of many families don\u2019t allow for a peaceful \u201ccoming together\u201d, and it\u2019s so hard when you\u2019re trying to grieve and walking on eggshells around other family members as you try to respect the wishes of your loved one.
