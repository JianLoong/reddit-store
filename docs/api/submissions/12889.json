My bf of four years (M32) is a lawyer. Between stress at school and the stress of his job we barely saw each other let alone had any intimate time. We decided to take a vacation where it would be about us and regaining that lost intimacy. So day 2 of 5 of our vacation in Turks and Caicos someone is knocking at our door, I thinks it\u2019s cleaning so I open it. To my surprise and complete confusion it\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s brother (M29). I ask what he was doing here thinking maybe this was a fantastical coincidence , he says that my bf invited him. My bf looks a bit sheepish but says that he thought it would be a nice bonding time for him and his brother if he tagged along. \nEven though I was furious I decided that I could make it work we had a lot of things pre planned/prepaid so I figured his brother couldn\u2019t come with us to those activities. Well he didn\u2019t tag along because my bf decided to go with with brother. Horseback riding was traded for wakeboarding, couples massages was traded in for snorkeling and riding ATVs, getting a nice quiet table in the back of the restaurant for two turned into a nice quiet spot in the back for three.  Intimate time in bed turned to a quickie in the shower so he could leave for golf. At that point I had enough. I pretty much spent the trip alone. As soon as the morning came to leave for home I didn\u2019t utter a word to my bf. \u201cDo you have the hotel keycard?\u201d Silence. \u201cWant me to carry to bags?\u201d Silence. It didn\u2019t say anything to him until he broke down a few hours after we got to our apartment. He\u2019s been really pissed that I\u2019m ignoring him but I can\u2019t help but be so angry that I continue to do it. AITA?\n\nEdit: For those asking we met at a trivia night. Also yes it\u2019s his real brother \n\nEdit 2: Maybe this might change some of your thoughts on this matter but he paid for the trip. He financially supports me and my schooling is paid for by my parents.\n\nEdit 3: I\u2019m still new to Reddit. Can I make multiple updates on the sub Reddit or should I just update on my page to make it easier for myself? Also I usually get up early with bf to have coffee and just talk (now a.m) because he gets home so late. So I might update after he leaves for work.", "created_utc": 1679463701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11y8j9b/aita_for_ignoring_my_bf_after_our_vacation/", "score": 1364, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You planned a trip so you two could reconnect, and he understood that that was purpose for this trip. To me it sounds like he has no interest in that, and brought his brother as a buffer. You deserve better. I can usually excuse age differences, but you two are at at very different stages in your life. You still have your schooling to complete and I assume work in medicine for a few years.  If you have children, by the time your student loans are paid off and you have the resources to care for a child, he will be in his 40s. \n\nGirl, know your worth. He blatantly disrespected you.  Find someone who appreciates you.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is as selfish as fuck. People who love you don't do this sort of shit. After the brother arrived I would have told your brother to decide between the two of you and from what you say of this guy I guess I would have been heading home immediately. Didn't your boyfriend ever have any other time to bond with his brother? I'd be rethinking this relationship if I were you.", "Nta but I wouldn\u2019t ignore him: tell him how angry and disappointed you are. Do you want to stay with him?", "NTA. He's really immature for someone his age who has an actual career. Clearly he has zero respect for you and your needs/wants. I'd leave this jerk in the rear-view mirror and get someone who respects me. Before you do anything else though, sit down with him and clear the air over this issue. Try to remain calm during the discussion, but be honest and listen to his side.", "What?! I would be so pissed! That asshole would be lucky to get the silent treatment... he would be getting the angry rant treatment. But, besides a pretty understandable impulse to break up with him, does he really want to be with you? Because that's not normal behavior in a happy romantic relationship. No one misses their brother so much that they invite them on what's supposed to be romantic bonding time, unless they're no longer interested in romance. He may say he wants to be with you. Maybe he finds it convenient? This man is not being a good partner to you. NTA", "NTA \n\nBut your \u201cboyfriend\u201d is a sailboat full of red flags. He basically broke up with you on the trip, so please find your shiny spine and leave.", "Why did a 28 year old lawyer start dating a 19 year old student?", "If your soon-to-be ex-boyfriend feels lonely, I'm sure he can invite his brother to visit.\n\nNTA And why even let him have a quickie in the shower? That man would never get to touch me again if he pulled this stunt on me.", "NTA As always, reddit is going to say rethink your involvement with this clueless boy", "He didn't tell you because he knew you wouldn't like it, but he did it anyway. Now he is angry at you because you reacted badly (just like he thought you would). \n\nUse your words and tell him how the holiday felt like 3rd wheeling your own relationship. Tell him a discussion before brother turned up would have been the mature and loving thing to do and that he changed the dynamic of the holiday which you are allowed to be hurt and annoyed over. If his response is to make more excuses or in some way blame you for \"ruining the holiday\", you will need to have a real think about how you are valued. If he apologises and takes on board what you say, brilliant. NTA", "He's made his position clear, you are not his priority. The silent treatment is juvenile so tell him straight up that he's a disrespectful arse and either send him to his brother or leave. ESH", "Hmm I\u2019m between NTA and ESH \n\nBut boyyy, just leave him! What is this silence treatment doing, except wasting your own time? \nYou know you want better than a 32 year old man who brings his brother along on your couples vacation and doesn\u2019t even tell you before hand. \nAnd you deserve it!", "NTA because I think you honestly tried to make the best of a bad situation. The silent treatment is manipulative if it\u2019s being used on purpose, so you know you need to take the high road somewhere good, I hope.", "NTA. I will be furious as well. This vacation was meant to be for you as a COUPLE not with little bro coming along. Do you think your boyfriend has lost interest in you and your relationship? Why didn\u2019t you confront him about inviting his brother and when you saw that plans were changing right away?. In some ways you also allowed for your boyfriend dictate what your vacation was going to be. Now you are giving him the cold shoulder and you are still not confronting the situation. What do you want? Do you want to resolve it or no?. My advice is for you to talk what happened over. Tell him how you felt and how bad that bother you. Maybe he is not that into you anymore and it\u2019s better to confront that. If everything is well on his part and he just made a terrible mistake, plan with him your next vacation for the TWO of you. After that, if he wants to plan a family vacation, let him know you will love that but he has to tell you ahead of time because is your vacation too. BTW, it is sooo weird the brother even went, if he would have gone with a girlfriend it would be ok but who the hell wants be a third wheel?", "I would\u2019ve said something right there and there cause don\u2019t play with me. Wanna ruin the trip even before the trip started for me? Imma make sure everyone feel the tension in the air. What he did was not it. Sorry but you deserve better NTA.", "NTA, I think his behaviour was outrageous and I personally would end the relationship. However I do think that giving someone the silent treatment when you're angry or upset is super childish and undermines your position.", ">I\u2019m ignoring him and not talking about my grievances and the trip\n\nESH. That conduct makes you an A, your BF's bizarre duck-and-cover makes him an A, and his brother the third wheel didn't give you guys any appreciable daytime \"alone time\", so he's an A.\n\nPlease start talking to BF. Tell him you're sorry for your silence but you just have no words to express your disappointment and heartbreak. And you'd like to know why he chose THIS WAY to break up with you.\n\n'Cause that's what happened, I'm pretty sure. Sorry, OP.", "ESH because the silent treatment, while understandable, won't solve anything. Are you thinking about what you're going to do next? Because a BF who invites his brother on a romantic getaway with his SO isn't that into you and/or is lousy at relationships in general.", "Soooooo NOT the Asshole! Sometimes being silent is the best way to handle something, a lot of nasty things get said in the heat of it. You have every right to be angry. I wouldn\u2019t continue to hold it in though. I do think it\u2019s weird that the brother thought it was okay to hang out the whole time\u2026 so I question whether your BF really wanted this vacation with you. I know that sounds harsh, but seriously\u2026 who does that?\nI hope you get things worked out one way or the other.", "NTA.  He's a selfish AH.  If he would pull this shit on you, I bet he's just a *wonderful* attorney with *no* sketchy ethics whatsoever. [eyeroll]", "You deserve better OP.  NTA", "ESH. silent treatment is childish. But why are you with someone who has so little respect for you.\n\nIf he cared he would have asked if his brother could come. if he truly cared he would not have asked his brother. if he truly cared he would not have cancelled your planned activities in favour of.activities with his brother. \n\nYou are the young one in your relationship but its time to be the adult nd have a grown up conversation with your boyfriend. Obviously you are both at very different stages of your life.", "NTA!\nI'm hurt and offended and I didn't even experience this.\n\nYour boyfriend ditched you for his brother.  He knew he was wrong to, which is why he never asked if it was ok to invite him and let you find out when his brother arrived and you were stuck.  Now he's angry because you're not letting it go.\n\nYou need to sit this man down and have a \"Come to Jesus\" meeting with him. He was incredibly selfish to do this and owes you an explanation, apology, and a replacement vacation (on his dime) that's equivelant or better than the one he ruined, along with a promise to not pull this crap again.\n\nIf this is a case of him inviting his brother to avoid you, then he owes it to you to be honest and not waste your time.\n\n OP, you deserve better!  Don't sweep this under the rug!", "What an absolute idiot your boyfriend is NTA he's either absolutely the dumbest smart person or he just really doesn't give a shit about you", "NTA\n\nBut, listen to what he\u2019s saying. You planned a trip to reconnect and get closer. He deliberately sabotaged that. He doesn\u2019t want to reconnect or get closer.\n\nThis is the best he\u2019s willing to offer. He\u2019s not ready to get married which is promising to make a new family of the two if you as a priority over his family of origin and isn\u2019t willing to move towards that.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about him, his actions are showing you it isn\u2019t mutual. If you don\u2019t want this for the rest of your life then you\u2019re being TA to yourself for not breaking up with him.", "NTA, he\u2019s the AH, and he has no fucking right to be pissed at you. You\u2019re not handling it well, but handling it well might mean just leaving him. Not sure what the hell he expects from you.\n\nHe treated you horribly, the kind of horribly that for your relationship to recover and last, he\u2019d need to make major changes. No relationship can survive the kind of disregard and disrespect he showed for you. If he gets that and repents and wants to make amends, great. If he thinks his behavior can be justified or brushed off, he\u2019s not up to the challenge of a relationship. If he thinks your relationship doesn\u2019t take work and effort, he\u2019s not up for it either.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t give him the silent treatment anymore. I\u2019d ask for couples counseling and let a pro help you discuss it. See if he can repair the damage and restore your trust in a future together. See if the counseling brings you clarity.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it says about him that he treated you this way. But nothing good. At best he\u2019s a mess, at worst he\u2019s an AH. I question why you so badly want to be with him.", "ESH, you have a bigger issue than your sulking, sit his ass down and find out why he felt it was appropriate to invite his brother, because it really seems that he doesn't particularly want or like your company", "ESH. He's definitely TA, massively so. But very soft Y-T-A too. Neither of of are communicating, full stop...and you giving the silent treatment is a case of 'two wrongs don't make a right'. He gets extra a-hole points too for being significantly older than you...he should know better and should never have degraded and effectively abandoned you alone in a foreign country.", "ESH. Him more so than you. If you had tried to have a conversation with your boyfriend during the holiday rather than simmered in silence, things might have been able to be salvaged.\n\nYour boyfriend either knew exactly what he was doing by inviting his brother, or he is completely dense. Either way, doesn\u2019t look good for your relationship.", "For being upset about the trip? NTA. For not speaking to your boyfriend YTA. Your boyfriend for inviting his brother on your romantic getaway - huge AH. I'll give the brother a pass because I am pretty sure he didn't have a clue what he was interrupting. \n\nNot talking isn't going to fix this. Sit your boyfriend down and ask him why he sabotaged your couples trip. That's what he did. Either he didn't want a romantic getaway with you (sorry for saying it) or he doesn't have boundaries with his family. \n\nYou need to know what his thoughts are on your relationship so you can make decisions about your future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, take a moment to step back and ask yourself why he was cruising for teenagers when you met, instead of dating guys closer to his age.", "Judging by your post, what makes you think he won't do the same thing again? Why be with an inconsiderate and secretive AH? Why? Not sorry, I am judging you so heavily right now and absolutely have no pity for you if you continue to stay in this relationship if ever he fucks up in the future - to be more precise, forgot to add that in before the edit.", "It is, he couldn\u2019t find someone with means and resources to support themself and therefore have control over their circumstances if an argument goes awry because they see him for what he is.\n\nPlease believe me, as someone who dated someone a similar age at 19, you\u2019ll look back when you reach your late 20s and wonder why on earth he was attracted to an 18 year old as they look like children.\n\nI got told I was so mature and he didn\u2019t see the age gap, and age gaps don\u2019t matter because we\u2019re adult enough not to discriminate against people etc. in reality it meant I was working retail jobs whilst studying at university and ended up trapped with him gif long leases that I couldn\u2019t afford to break as his behaviour got worse. Now I know it\u2019s deliberate, even if not fully conscious on their part when they groom you and that no woman their age would put up with their behaviour.\n\nAge gaps themselves aren\u2019t an issue if you\u2019re in similar life stages and there is no difference in your ability to escape or take control of the situation. So if you\u2019d graduated, had a few years to get established in your career, have some savings and life lessons/experience and met someone 10 years older, fine. You need space you can go to a hotel for a few days and afford it. You can break up and afford to move out etc.\n\nSame with other relationships where one person has a power differential. You could be the same age, but dating your line manager at work could mean a swingle argument or you not putting up with them doing something wrong like cheating means you fear getting sacked or they insinuate it. Same for stay at home parents who are not given access to finances.\n\nI\u2019m fully expecting you to feel defensive about this and reject what I\u2019m saying. Please, don\u2019t outright dismiss it and instead think about what power differential relationships look like from the outside and at least reflect on it when it\u2019s not you. Eg what was wrong with boss/employee or student/teacher etc. how did one person have power over another. What were the risks for the other party if they said \u201cno\u201d at any point.

It sounds like you guys made plans, pretty concrete plans, for this to be a trip for the two of you. It's really worrying to me that you felt like this was supposed to be a much needed time of rejuvination for the relationship and he... well he didn't make it a priority. I mean, jfc OP, if my partner did that to me I think I would just want to give up.\n\nObviously love is complicated and full of tradeoffs made in a less-than ideal world, but when you love someone you carve out the time of day, period (e-fucking-specially if you have enough money to engage in some of the side activities you mentioned).\n\n Now, he may really just be oblivious and that simultaneously means you have to be very clear and explicit about what you expected, how what happened is different from that, how it made you feel (specifically mention to him that you felt like this was a time for you guys to reconnect and what he did made you feel disregarded), etc. At the same time you need to not let your emotions cloud your ability to make these things known to him and give him a chance to make amends. It's actually especially important to get a handle on yourself just enough to really confront him and potentially let him come out as the asshole, mask-off.\n\nI learned this from watching my Dad and Stepmom as a teenager. Both of them are pretty blunt people, and sometimes that just inevitably means you step on your partner's toes. Same with me and my current partner. They call it a \"repair attempt\". One makes a transgression, and the other will calmly ask \"would you try that again? It makes me feel x when you do/say y and I don't think you mean to make me feel that way\". It sounds clinical and like you're on one of those kid's shows where someone is teaching you how to use your manners, but hey, if it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid.\n\nIf he's not oblivious or really just doesn't care, he can say whatever. He can even say he won't ever do it again, or that he's really sorry, and those things may even be true, but you just have to wait until he confirms it or blows it in a patterned behavior. Weird things happen in relationships when we're not being attentive to our lovers, and sometimes we need a firm reminder to do as much, but patterns show us how people really feel after we make ourselves and our feelings known.\n\nThe caveat is that he only has an opportunity to be as good after a transgression as you lay out. Should he have done it in the first place? No, good God, that feels one step away from having a lover just say \"yeah, actually, you're not that important, but my brother is!\" out loud.\n\nSeeing some of your comments, I think I wouldn't be surprised if you uncover some not so overtly negative things. For example, maybe your partner is like me, and it's always the more the merrier especially if you enjoy being around family. You may even discover that he thought he was doing something fun or less run-of-the-mill if you have a heart to heart about it. Again he handled it awfully, but sometimes discovering someone's intent is more than half the battle.\n\nHonestly OP, if he's not willing to hear you out and have this conversation, you need someone who will. An aloof man is one thing, we're often not cultured how I think we ought to be in emotional thinking, but persisting in that sort of behavior is a giant red flag, especially if there's a possibility of entrapment later due to income disparity.", "NTA.

I loving bf would spend every waking moment with you on that trip. The fact that he did not tells me he is trying to break up with you but doesn't have the cajones to do it. Instead he's treating you like crap in hopes that you get fed up and leave him. Then he won't feel so bad because you're the one who broke up with him.

At 18 I dated a 34 y/o, but looking back it\u2019s because we both had the emotional range of teaspoons. The relationship wasn\u2019t healthy because neither one of us were showing up as our best selves. I think that this interaction just proves that you\u2019re both immature, and probably why you\u2019ve been together for as long as you have. \n\nBut remember that in our 20\u2019s we grow, and mature- and often times if someone has made it to their 30\u2019s and is still hanging onto immature, and manipulative behaviors they are VERY unlikely to change those parts of them and grow. That what this whole trip sounds like- and it also sounds like BECAUSE he financed the trip that he\u2019s left you with the impression that you\u2019re not allowed to be unhappy with it- which ISN\u2019T true.
