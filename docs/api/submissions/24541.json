She was out of line and needed to be called out. There can be a discussion regarding your tone, but I personally would hesitate to tone police people who're calling out other people's racist behaviour against them.", "NTA,   \nSounds like your friend is a radical Koreaboo, I think she may be just uneducated on how to talk to korean people, calling somebody \"Oppa\" who they just met is a little strange. \n\nWith the grandma situation is abit ambiguous because If I didn't know an elderly woman's name, I would've just called her Grandma too..", "NTA\n\nAt sixteen, she should be aware that certain behavior is inappropriate.", "NTA and I know people don\u2019t like hearing that age will improve perspective but at 16 she\u2019s probably clinging to a friendship, assuming too much connection, and clearly being way too familiar (keep in mind she saw you being excited too so it may seem like a quick turn from bonding to overstepping since the topic was never discussed). I 100% think she will look back and see this as one of the cringey things she did when she was young. \n\nHope it smooths over however you navigate it!", "She clearly has a fetish for Koreans which is weird NTA", "I'm sure I read this exact same post like 3 months ago.", "Yeah fellow WOC, you're NTA. You'll encounter a lot of Sarahs in your life and beware of them as they are not your friends.", "NTA but you could have handled it better. Maybe she had read a lot about your culture and was excited about it, but lacked first-hand experience of how interactions actually work within it. You could have taken her aside, explain how it actually works, and gauge her reaction before thinking the worst.\n\nI see a lot of Americans with an Eu grandparent crossing the pond and doing a similar thing. I don't think they mean to fetishize other cultures, they are just unaware that, in other cultures, personal relationships work a different way.", "NTA. She was being racist, intentionally or not, and you put down a boundary. If you want to, you can explain to her how her view/treatment of your family and culture made you feel, but you don't need to forgive her or take it upon yourself.", "NAH \n\nYou can't control what you and your family are made uncomfortable by, but she's just trying to enjoy herself and clearly is invested into the idol scene. At the same time, you couldn't just calmly explain why you found it uncomfortable to her first?", "It seemed like you had a problem with her attitude for a long time, didn't say anything, and then when she continued behaving in that manner, you yelled at her in front of your whole family. YTA. She can be more sensitive, and you tell her that, but it's an asshole behavior to shame her like that.", "NTA though you need to have a pity! Being white in America is becoming very unpopular and even  shameful. Why would not you let her self-identify as Korean instead?  On a related note Sarah is lucky that she is a girl, can hardly imagine the horror of being a white male nowadays.", "I\u2019m going to take a different approach to everyone else.\n\nYTA - if you feel that she was fetishizing your culture it was an opportunity at a later date to explain this to her. Try to make her understands where she is going wrong.  From what I see, she lacks a stable and loving family, just assuming on my part.\n\nWhat you said to her was overly harsh and unnecessary", "YTA. No reason to be mean. Maybe she\u2019s got special-needs or something.  Besides, you enabled this whole thing, even admitting that you were \u201cexcited to share your love for your culture\u201c with her. On top of that, invite her to your house. Now you\u2019re mad that she is trying to fit in the culture?  What does Oppa mean?  Is that like Oompa Loompa?", "YTA. You needed to explain the culture to her. I grew up in Toronto and have friends from different cultures. My friends' families readily accepted me in their families as they were accepted in mine. For example, they called my grandparents Opa and Memere, and I called their grandma Baba and their aunts Teta. It was actually a wonderful time as there was always a holiday to celebrate at someone's home. Very happy times. If your culture sees what she did as rude, then that's something you really need to explain to her.", "YTA/NTA.\n\nMixed signals.First you are very specific about you being a \"korean\" and Sarah being \"white\" (specific nationality vs generalization).You then emphasize that your school has never made a deal about peoples' origins with \"Culture days\", and you then being exciting about showing/flagging your specific culture to her.\n\nBaseline: You do divide people based on culture \\_and\\_ you find it rather important (especially your own, the rest may seem to be generic, like \"white\").\n\nSarah is apparently very much into Korea / some subculture from Korea - if not unhealthily so. But the thing is - she seems to love it / value it and is overly excited with having you as a friend.  (Not only that, but there may be additional joy due to having issues with finding a place in the school in the first place?).\n\n\\>I lost it at her and told her to quit fetishizing my culture and she'll never be Korean.\n\nIt seems like you felt pride when someone was \"idolizing\" you / your culture, but then get offended when people desire to join in.  To you this is then a race thing and not a cultural thing, making you somewhat racist.\n\nShe may be \"too much\", but all that can be said for sure is that she loves the culture, and culture comes from people socializing with each other, not from biology. It's hard to call her racist. Much easier with you.\n\nThere are a lot of people who show appreciation to my ethnicity / culture / way of life,  and I could would never in my wildest dreams imagine being offended if someone joked/proposed to \"become an honorary member\", I'd just find it delightful and fun.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can tell the difference by looking how irrelevant her actual relationship to the people concerned is and how much more important her idea of what these people should be is to her. She doesn't care who OP is, she wants her to fit her idea of Korean people (becoming an idol, living in Korea--this is a caricature of what \"being Korean\" means) and use her to satisfy her own dreams (living in Korea herself to literally \"live out her Kdrama dreams\"). She ignores her actual non-existent relationship with OP's brother because she wants to \"play Korean\", and that was only an example by OP. \n\nLove and appreciation is expressed through listening, learning, and valuing the *people* you interact with more than your idealized image of a culture.", "I gave my reasons above.

Yes, many autistic people have a hard time recognizing social cues and boundaries, while some of us are painfully aware of them.
