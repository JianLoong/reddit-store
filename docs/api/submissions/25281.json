I cost her family thousands in upkeep.", "selftext": "This has been bothering me for years, now. I grew up in a small farming community.  I had a good friend who lived a short drive from my family's farm. Her parents were not farmers,  but they had bought property in the countryside.  Her father told her he would buy her a horse for her 16th birthday.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe house she lived in had a corral with a  lean-to and a trough. Basically an exercise ring for horses.  She was extremely excited about the upcoming purchase of her horse and I, being raised in a dairy, asked her in front of her father about when they would be building a barn and a pasture fence for the horse.  She laughed at me and her father took great pride in telling me that all of that could wait. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe got her horse the following spring. A 16 hand, grey and white paint named Money.  I helped her feed and water him, but it took 3 months for her father to get a saddle.  Once he did, I had to show her how to saddle him and halter him, and she went riding exactly once.  Money refused to even walk, all he wanted to do was graze. With the bit in his mouth,  because he'd been locked into a dirt corral for months.  My friend didn't know how to ride or sit the saddle.  She never rode him again,  and Money just stood in the corral. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat winter was extremely harsh, which is common in the North.  I went to her house in -26 C weather,  and the 15 minute drive took 45 minutes on the back country lanes. When I got there, I saw Money standing in the corral,  as far into the lean-to he could get. He had ice in his mane and tail, and ice and snow all over his withers and back.  He didn't even have a blanket or straw to lie down in, and no way to get out of the wind. He was stood with his head and neck down, covered in snow. \n\n\n\n\n\nI cried all the way home, and as soon as I walked in, I made a call to the RSPCA. I told them her address,  her parents names, and the conditions and food Money was dealing with.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day,  my friend called me, screaming and threatening me.  The RSPCA had visited her house and threatened her parents with livestock neglect and animal cruelty if they didn't immediately transport Money into a heated barn for boarding.  They said he was underweight, undergroomed and endangered.  It was going to cost her parents thousands to board him. \n\n\n\n\nIt probably would have been cheaper to build a  reasonable shelter and a pasture fence,  honestly.  \n\nBut, when she was on the phone,  screaming at me and threatening me, I lied.\n\n\n\n\n\nI told her I had no idea who would do such a thing.  \n\n\n\n\n\nShe wanted to fight me, but I only wanted her horse to survive the winter.  I wasn't jealous of her.  I didn't do it to make her or her family look bad. I did it because they were going to kill that poor horse.  \n\n\nShe told everyone that I'd grassed her and that I was a liar. Money was immediately transported to a heated boarding facility and sold before the spring.  \n\nI reported her, and then I lied. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692735353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yh7y7/aita_i_reported_a_good_friend_for_animal_neglect/", "score": 241, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She clearly knew who it was, it's not like the lie even helped.", "NTA. But you should be ashamed for lying.  Own what you did and be proud of it, you got an abused animal the care it needed, in losing a \u201cfriend\u201d you gained the respect of any decent people.", "NTA The poor hourse was being neglected and basically abused, since he was left in the cold weather without so much as a blanket. Screw her. You did the right thing.", "That title bait lol\n\nBut, no NTA. The horse couldn\u2019t help itself, the owners refused to help it. You did the right thing.", "NTA, you were young and wanted to save the animal. I wonder where everyone else hid their conscience while witnessing this", "Your title really paints you as the villain, \n\nReading the story NTA.", "ESH. \n\nThey were being awful to the poor horse. \n\nAt the same time, if you are going to do something like that, at least act like an adult and own it.  This was your friend and you did what you thought was right.  So don't be a coward", "ESH.  Your friend is kind of an asshole.  Her dad is the true asshole here since ultimately he was responsible for caring for the horse.  You aren't an asshole for reporting them for animal cruelty, but you are an asshole for not having the guts to be honest about it.", "Well, you are NTA for reporting her. That is so very sad!!! They clearly don't have any empathy and understanding of how to care for a living being and that horse deserves better! But YTA for lying... She clearly knew it was you, she stayed mad at you even after you said it wasn't you so lying was pointless. You still lost her as a friend. You should have just been honest.  Her family was in the wrong, so you did the right thing and should not have felt bad about it.", "YTA.  Not for reporting the neglect but for lying about it.", "I mean yeah NTA. Good job on doing the right thing. But reading some of your comment replies, what was the actual chance she was going to fight you? She ostracized you either way. She wasn't stupid and knew who called. It just seems like more work to try and live in the lie after you have been found out and let it eat away at you for years, rather than just own it. \n\nNot sure where you live but chances of you getting a criminal record for her starting the fight are small. It would be self defense on your part.", "NTA. Animal abusers don't deserve the truth. You warned them over and over what they needed to do to keep that poor horse in reasonable conditions, and they ignored you. You went above and beyond your duty to a friend and she said, no thank you, but please continue enabling me in killing this poor horse. People that ask you to be complicit in a crime, especially one that is that cruel to an innocent animal, don't deserve respect, and they are not entitled to the truth. Especially when they start getting physically threatening and telling the truth would only be opening yourself to attack from people that are absolutely, 100%, in the wrong.", "NTA - you saved the horse, and then you prevented a physical altercation from happening by lying about it. none of those things make you the AH. it seems like you feel a lot of guilt over this and i get that, but it really wasn't your bad - your friend was the one who mistreated Money, and the one who tried to physically assault you.", "Overall NTA but YTA for not talking to her and her family about it before calling. If she were such a good friend (your words), I would tell my good friend the issues I had with Money's care. I think friends owe each other the truth. I know it's an uncomfortable conversation but friends should be able to have difficult conversations. I would also say \"hey, what I saw wasn't ok. I really think you should give Money away or build him a shelter. If you don't do something, I will be reporting you to the RSPCA\". I understand it's a hard conversation but I'm personally the type of person who doesn't mind having those conversations.   \n\n\nOther than not giving them a heads up, I don't think calling the RSPCA was the wrong idea - NTA for doing this. The animal clearly isn't well cared for or loved and it needed help before it died out there. -26? That is disgusting. You made the right call, just feel like you should own up to it because who cares if the friendship blows up. Do you really even want a friend that can't even treat an animal well?  \n\n\nSO relieved that your call saved Money.", "I was not wanting to get into a physical altercation when the RSPCA had already made their decision on the matter.  I didn't want a criminal record because she didn't have a barn,  ffs", "I apologize.  I wasn't trying to make a click bait,  I reported a friend and then lied about it.  It bothers me that I lied to her, but I was a teenager and I had no reason to fight. I wasn't even angry with her, I was angry that her father had done nothing to shelter a horse he'd spent thousands on, and was willing to let freeze to death.  It wasn't her fault that she had no idea how to care of a horse and neither did her father. \n\n\n\n\nThere was absolutely no point in getting  into a physical confrontation when the RSPCA had immediately demanded better care for the horse after one inspection. The point had already been proven.  Honestly? If the inspector had shown up and said that everything was fine? I would probably have taken the beating for being an idiot.", "I didn't realize the title made it seem as though I was lying about the horse.

And she was a very large and healthy woman.  She outweighed me by a good 18 kg. She would have pummeled me and made no mistake about letting me know. I was terrified.  I didn't make the call to be mean, I made it for poor Money.  But I'm still ashamed of myself for lying to her. It wasn't her fault that her father didn't know the first thing about horses.", "My friend told everyone that I was an informant and to never trust me after that.  She and most of our friends never spoke to me again.  I did report her, though.  But I did it for the horse,  not for stupid teenage hijinks.  I lied about it, though.  To everyone.  I have felt conflicted about this for years.", "She wanted to fight me about it.  I didn't want to fight her.  I've been upset about the lie for years,  but I just didn't see how getting into a brawl was worth it.", "She wanted to fistfight me.  I wasn't willing to fight someone over something her father was responsible for.  Money was taken care of, and that's all I cared about.  She wasn't worth a criminal record.", "Yeah, I know.  I was noting how she wanted to fight you because she got caught abusing an animal.", "Whatever happened to Money?", "well she sounds like a coo coo and you probably dodged a bullet there HAHA", "It was baffling to me at the time, and I immediately just......denied it. It wasn't her fault that her father didn't bother to build a shelter for her horse.  But still,  I lied directly to her, and it's bothered me for years, now.

I'm glad Money got away from those people. \n\nA few years ago, I reported my cousin anonymously because he thought the way to train a puppy was to beat it into submission.

You did it to protect yourself.", "NTA at all, you are in fact a very good person. \n\nHorses are an investment. Not just money but effort. The amount of care they require is gigantic and your friends parents clearly impulsively bought a horse with no knowledge of this as a cute present. \n\nThe fact that they just bought Money without asking the previous owner if he was a good riding horse or did well on a lead or with a halter shows this. Not every horse enjoys being ridden. \n\nThe fact they thought they could just dump him outside in the freezing cold is so sad and cruel. He must have been absolutely miserable. \n\nYou actively aided in helping him into a better situation, I\u2019m sure he had a much better life in a warm barn and with an open pasture to graze in once he was sold.", "NTA - you stood up for a defenseless animal, you did the right thing.

I hope whoever has him now treasures him.\n\nNTA", "NTA, the horse was definitely being neglected.\n\nA point though: stables and/or barns typically are not heated buildings, and for good reasons.  First, the risk of fire due to hay, straw, sawdust, dust, etc.  Second, in order to keep heat inside of any building it has to be well insulated, which keeps the dust from the hay, straw, and sawdust trapped in the building for the animals to breathe.  Stables are well ventilated by design so that dust isn't trapped.  You might find something like an overhead infrared heater being used for a particular stall or a space heater in a tack room, or a heated water source so that the horse has access to fresh water all the time, but not a completely heated building.\n\nHorses do fine in cold weather if they have a place to get out of the wind and wet, if they have a good supply of hay and fresh water, and if they have a blanket.", "NTA", "NTA.  Thank you for saving that poor animal.", "NTA for reporting her. At all.\n\nBut you feel guilt about the lying for a reason. It\u2019s always best not to when you can avoid it.

Yes you called them, they were abusing an animal. if they weren't animal control would have done nothing and left. they should have had been responsible animal owners", "Because she didn't want to be beaten? That sounds like a perfectly good reason to me.", "It sounds like the friend wanted to get into a physical altercation over this and OP lied to try and avoid that happening.", "I don't know, if someone was screaming at me and threatening me, I'd probably lie too. This just makes the friend a double AH. And the lie IMO is absolutely nothing morality-wise compared to the neglect of the horse. Even if the lying were an AH move in general, lying to someone who doesn't care that their horse is freezing to death is kinda justified.", "Alright then?", "I was a very small teenage boy, in a  small rural area.  I was being threatened by a girl who was much larger and heavier than me. If she had attacked me, I couldn't even fight back. I lied.  I am still ashamed of it, but she could have thrashed me in public and I would never have lived it down if I'd defended myself by harming a woman. I would have been charged for assault the moment I struck back, and she threatened me not just over the phone but in person later that same week.", "You lied to protect yourself from a beating. *There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.* And you acted to save an abused, neglected, suffering animal. You are a good person. The world needs more people like you.", "You did the right thing!!! That takes courage. money gets to be happy somewhere because of you!", ">It wasn't her fault that she had no idea how to care of a horse and neither did her father.\n\nYes, it was her fault. When you decide to take an animal you make research to be sure you can welcome them in the best conditions and if you can't you don't take them.\n\nThis kind of mindset is why so many dogs are abandonned because people decide to take a big dog or a high energy dog and shove it in a tiny apartment and drive him crazy, then they throw it away because it's too \"hard\"\n\nRSPCA didn't tell them who turned them in, especially because of possible retaliation, you're NTA", "I mean, that doesn't change my thoughts necessarily.

Maybe you need to explore why your reaction is still bothering you?", "The hell with her. You saved that poor horse. I'd do worse than lie in the same situation.", "There's no shame in lying to protect your physical wellbeing. Hell, there's plenty of social situations where lying is the best option: when a small child asks you if they did a good job, when someone has dementia and is getting confused, when it's not your information to share, and so on. \n\nBasically, you did the right thing for the horse, and then you did the right thing for yourself. You are also a creature worthy of protection.", "Lying isn't inherently wrong. You lied to someone who was happy to let her pet freeze and then blamed you for trying to get him help. Who cares if you told her you were president of the moon and had a pet narwhal? She sucks.", "Nah, it was also her fault. She wanted the horse, but pretty much left it to die when she found out it was a living being and not a barbie toy.", "As a fellow horse girl it makes me so happy to know he went to a place with experience and plenty of love to give him.
