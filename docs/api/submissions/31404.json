It's not just about the clothes; it's about the bigger picture of him not meeting your emotional needs. The fact that he was dismissive when working on the PC together and unresponsive during a deep conversation about your relationship shows a concerning pattern. His approach of wanting to \"try our best\" seems vague and unhelpful, especially when he doesn't engage in meaningful actions or discussions to improve things. It's understandable to feel unfulfilled and unloved in this situation.\n\nThis PC incident and his coldness during your vulnerable conversation are particularly troubling. You guys just came back from a fight, to being mean while doing something that could have been a bonding activity shows a lack of empathy and effort to connect. Even more concerning is his detached attitude during a heartfelt, vulnerable talk. When you're opening up and seeking a deeper connection, his indifference and lack of engagement speak volumes. It's hard to rebuild or work on a relationship when one partner is so emotionally unavailable and dismissive of the other's feelings.\n\nAdditionally, his statement about \"trying our best\" feels like a deflection, especially if his current actions don't align with being better. It's one thing to say you'll try, but it's another to actually show it through your actions. His lack of effort in the present, like being mean over something as simple as fixing a PC or being emotionally distant during serious conversations, contradicts his claim of trying. It's a deflection from addressing the real issues at hand and making tangible changes.", "I think the sad fact is that he has already broken up with you, he just hasn't left.

I don't recommend this approach.", " His lack of response during your vulnerable moments is not just concerning, it's a significant red flag in the relationship. When you're sharing your deepest concerns and emotions, the expectation is for your partner to engage, show empathy, and provide support. His dismissive attitude and reluctance to share his own thoughts or feelings undermine the very essence of partnership and emotional connection.

I grew up in a home where we only wore \u201coutside clothes\u201d (good jeans, pants, dresses, button down shirts, dress clothes and school clothes) for going out in public.  We had work clothes for tending the field, animals, or doing outside chores.  We also had play clothes (shorts/tees) for when we didn\u2019t need the protection of sturdier clothes and we could move freely and just be kids outside. Then we had inside clothes and bedtime clothes.  We wore inside clothes for tending to the household chores, lounging/watching tv or a movie or doing crafts and bed clothes for bed. We bathed regularly and sometimes a few times a day, depending on what we had going on.  I was one of 5 and we didn\u2019t have a lot of money, so \u201coutside clothes\u201d needed to last longer and had to be kept in great shape.  It was always clean ironed/pressed, and maybe starched, if necessary.  The work clothes served a particular purpose and was used only for that.  Work jeans, play clothes, or house clothes would never be worn to church or social gatherings.  Clothes were important, especially if you didn\u2019t have many or money to easily replace them. \n\nWe always had to be clean and appropriately dressed when we went anywhere, and this included hair and makeup when age determined it appropriate.  You did not put on outside clothes without appropriately bath, perfume, hair and makeup. And yes, even to the grocery store, or to run errands.  \n\nMy mother was a stickler for appearance and made sure we didn\u2019t wear \u201coutside or good clothes\u201d unnecessarily.   And laundry for 7 was a beast.  And it was one of my chores.  And God help me if it wasn\u2019t done right or if something got damaged.  It wasn\u2019t always as easy as throwing some dirties into the washer and then dryer.   It was sheets and towels on the line for 6 beds, comforters and quilts washed in a tub and hung to dry.  And hand washed, dress clothes that were then starched and pressed then hung for later use.  Work clothes were washed in a \u201cwring-a-type\u201d washer on the deck after being soaked and scrubbed, then hung on the line to dry.   Then the rest could be washed in the washer and dried in the dryer.  \n\nAs a little bit of the \u201cmind-set\u201d if you will, we couldn\u2019t afford things, so we made them.  Mom sewed most of our special occasion clothes.  She taught us all (boys and girls) to sew, macrame, knot, crochet, and how to do other crafts that allowed us to make things we needed or wanted.  And my Dad taught us all (boys and girls) the basics of mechanics, how to drive almost anything, how to grow food and care for our animals, how to build buildings, animal homes, and more.  \n\nWhen we were able (10 or 12) we were responsible for making our own pageant dresses, formals, ball gowns and other items we needed or wanted.  If we didn\u2019t make the, necessary gowns or costumes, we never would have had any to wear, but we had to participate anyway.  Did you know that floral sheets make beautiful sundresses for Easter?  For reference, I handed down 82 formals when I finished high school and had made them all  myself because I would not wear a dress twice.  It was my \u201csplurge\u201dthat I was allowed because I was able to source affordable fabrics and supplies, and none went to waste.  Quilts and patches, anyone?\n\nAnyway, the name of the game was self-sufficiency and creating what you wanted/needed (including but not limited to hammocks, bedding, covers of all sorts, baskets, slippers, moccasins, and more) and not wasting things.  Essentially, it was \u201chomesteading \u201c before it became popular.  \n\nHence, outside and inside clothes were important and it was considered wasteful to wear outside clothes at inappropriate times.  \n\nThe terms have been around for a long time, at least in my neck of the woods.  I often wondered if the terms for outside or inside clothing were used mostly by those of us in a lower socioeconomic tier, due to having to be frugal, or if it\u2019s mostly a southern thing.  \n\nThese things have been engrained in me and I passed it along to my kids at a young age.  Keep clean, bathe often, wear the appropriate clothes for the situation.  I still cannot wear my dress/office outside clothes after I get home.  I have to freshen and change immediately.  I will not wear my outside clothes at home unless we are hosting.  \n\nI remember wondering what it would be like to just wear whatever you wanted whenever you wanted. I tried it in college, but it felt wrong.  So, I just did what was normal for me.  After joining the workforce and having a forward-facing position, I then had tiers of outside clothes and what I wore depended on my schedule that day.  I also found that, some days, I would change my outfit to suit different needs in one day.

This is a fallacy of course, and only making all of his own issues worse for himself (and you). He needs to be brave and truly look inward to actualize what he needs and wants out of life, and to be healthy enough to admit if it means you two are simply incompatible.\n\nTaking your example of sleeping in his clothes\u2014he probably sees it as a morally neutral thing that is not inherently on its own hurtful, so you being hurt by it is an overreaction. And to him, if he\u2019s just as comfortable in his everyday clothes as he would be in pjs, the effort required of him to change clothes simply isn\u2019t worth it. If you notice these \u2018cycles\u2019 of him doing something thoughtfully that you asked for some time period, and then reverted back to the original behavior, it\u2019s because somewhere he\u2019s just flatly unhappy. He needs to address the root issue *causing* the behaviors that hurt you, not just \u201cfix\u201d any and all \u201cnitpicky\u201d things you bring up and then let himself get overwhelmed and frustrated at \u201call the things I need to change about myself\u2014how can I possibly remember them ALL??\u201d\n\nAt some point I suggest laying out what a happy relationship looks like *for you,* without any concessions. If there were zero consequences, zero worries about how your partner will react, true absolute zero negatives; what relationship dynamic will make YOU the happiest you could be? Be completely self indulgent in this! Then ask him what his looks like. Same \u2018rules.\u2019 If he gives you a non-answer, like \u201cyeah I want all those same things,\u201d ask if he wants that or if he *wants to want* that, and if that was something he wants, ask why it\u2019s so hard for him (hint: it\u2019s hard because he *doesn\u2019t* want it. He just wants there *not to be issues/conflict.*) It\u2019s unrealistic for two people to have 1:1 identical relationship views. But before entering this conversation, make it very clear there is zero judgment of each other\u2019s true and honest response. Anything you say to each other isn\u2019t a guarantee that it\u2019ll happen, it\u2019s essentially your own perfect fantasy. For example, you could say that an open relationship would be very fulfilling for you as an individual human person, but if that would devastate him, then you could either work towards a compromise, make a total sacrifice, or accept incompatibility and break up on good terms. Relationships are a negotiation, so bring everything to the table and work together towards an agreement that will allow both of you to live true to yourselves as individuals and to actually be happy. If the happiest your relationship as a unit could possibly be is complacent or worse, codependent, then you are incompatible. \n\nIf you can\u2019t trust him with ANY of that, then you need to break up, because he\u2019s not emotionally mature enough to have those *real* conversations. That\u2019s a journey he has to make for himself; or, he could just live the easy, complacent, *comfortable with things being \u2018good enough\u2019* life. That\u2019s his choice, and if you want more than that and he does not, you\u2019re incompatible.\n\nThat\u2019s all the actionable advice I have to give you, so feel free to stop reading what became an unexpectedly long-winded comment hahaha, the rest is just my own experience. I do think my experience may be a valuable perspective, or I could be way off! Idk! But I already spent Minutes typing it all out, so I hope it\u2019s at least interesting.\n\nI\u2019m honestly speaking directly from first hand personal experience. For my entire adult life, this was exactly how I would think and behave. It\u2019s a miserable existence\u2014feeling like you\u2019re always doing something wrong, feeling burnt out and disappointed in yourself because you don\u2019t WANT to hurt your partner and truly are not being malicious, praying to God that your partner doesn\u2019t address the \u201celephant in the room\u201d because you just do not have the energy to have That Conversation *again* but you\u2019re acutely aware that you\u2019re both thinking about it, feeling empty and incapable of living your own life because you feel like you have to live by your partner\u2019s wants and needs, walking on eggshells because you\u2019re desperately avoiding any and all confrontation, being way too terrified of facing yourself and uncovering answers and feelings that you don\u2019t know how to talk about, immense self-doubt and fear paralyzing you from doing anything (and refusing to accept that *inaction is still action*)\u2014basically just living on the fence between \u201ceverything is good\u201d and \u201ceverything is crumbling and we\u2019re fighting\u201d without being able to make a decision for yourself. So you try to find a comfortable balance on the fence line, but eventually you will teeter and fall onto one of the two sides. And your only motivation is just to get back to where you were, and \u201ctry harder\u201d to remember all the things you \u201cneed to change,\u201d knowing full well that your only goal is complacency (you\u2019ll NEVER admit that to yourself, but you\u2019ll know, beneath all your own bullshit that you use to convince yourself).\n\nI kept thinking I could be happy if I just did everything my husband asked of me, but that made me bitter and resentful towards myself and towards him. And I really hurt us both. What changed all that was having a personal awakening, that I truly was NOT living for myself, and I needed to look all my fears, insecurities, and prejudices in the face and name them. I had to be harshly honest with myself in my intentions behind everything I was doing or wanted to do, as well as *why* I believed in certain meanings of things (re: prejudices). This was the hardest thing, personally; to let go of the \u2018moral requirement\u2019 of self-judgment and the terror of what it\u2019ll all mean in terms of the kind of person I am, and just accept these things as facts.", "You mean a full on shirt and pants? Not just underwear? Unless camping, who sleeps like that?  \n\nThat\u2019s something a therapist should look into.

Or is it more of a subjective matter e.g. \"this seems like a hygienic thing to do\".\n\nTo be noted here that hygiene for mental satisfaction is different from a medical hygiene that has some scientific basis.\n\nI don't see any study or research published that says that people who change clothes after reaching home fell less ill than those who didn't change clothes. Even for doctors. It's not like doctors carry germs on their clothes. The whole Covid spreads via clothes myth was busted later part of the pandemic by doctors. However, any doctor working specifically in infectious disease department may have some chance of carrying germs home.\n\nSo, I think we can easily conclude that post is a subjective mental hygiene matter that has no objective measure. I have seen worse maniacs who have extreme level of sense of cleanliness. And they can put to shame OP here because of how OP (and most of the western world) cleans up after using toilet. So... Point is it's very subjective and so OP needs to calm down and stop looking for people who are like her. OP can always negotiate such things by offering something else in exchange. It's more of a negotiation problem than hygiene. This can be solved but definitely not by proving that the partner does not understand hygiene.", "NAH. It\u2019s not a big deal really.
