I don\u2019t know who\u2019d be comfortable with this including people who work in labs .. this is yet another symptom of underlying lack of care and low effort on his part- forget therapy and leave him. Turf him out. Get rid for the sake of your own mental wellbeing x", "Gross.", "Oh eww. NTA OP. This is plain yuck and crazy on your bf's part", "The fact that he\u2019s not changing into sleeping clothes isn\u2019t the problem but the symptom! The problem is that he has such little regard for you and your wishes! I mean if he can\u2019t honor such a simple request then what\u2019s going to happen when you need him for something really earth shattering?\nI get what you mean by not feeling loved. It\u2019s the little things that show love day to day! \nIf my husband is up before me he will make me a cup of coffee when he hears me get up. It\u2019s not the Hope Diamond, but it tells me that he\u2019s thinking of me! \nNo you\u2019re NTA for asking for such small concession from your partner!", "Is he disordered?", "How da fuck do you sleep in jeans?!", "That is completely unhygienic. You really need to sit him down and have a serious conversation about this. Focus on why it bothers you rather than what he should do. I read you also have long days but maybe you can prepare the towels and the home clothes so he can get into the shower when he gets home (you shouldn\u2019t have to do that, though).\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t want to change, that will only cause resentment that will fester for the foreseeing future.\n\nHe should listen.", "God not the denim in bed. I draw a hard line there. Big NTA.", "What they hell? Who sleeps in clothes?", "Ok sleeping in a jacket is CRAZY", "But, honey, the dirt has already been rubbed off on all the furniture....", "Sleeping in jeans is weird as hell. I can understand the same shirt you wore during the day and underwear or wherever but jeans???", "Why are you still with him? Your post history shows that this is a pretty terrible relationship, and you were asking people in r/relationship advice on how to break up with him days ago. NTA, but what\u2019s the point in changing someone just to break up with them?", "Honestly if you need to tip toe around him and not be able to be direct with your words, he needs to grow up.\n\nYou already took the steps to ask kindly, and now he's blatantly ignoring your boundary.", "not being clean is a red flag yes", "It\u2019s also her bed and he\u2019s the one doing the unhygienic thing? He can absolutely make the decision to not change his clothes, but there are consequences for that and one of those will be that his girlfriend no longer wants to share a bed with him.\n\nIt\u2019s a red flag because he\u2019s not willing to make a small and reasonable concession for the person he supposedly loves. Yes he has the right to take the \u2018it\u2019s my house too and I do what I want\u2019 stance, but refusing to make small and reasonable concessions (accepting influence, as the gottmans call it) will damage his relationship.\n\nWhen we choose to share our homes, lives and beds with a partner we need to be willing to compromise so that everyone has a happy home. My partner\u2019s particular about how he wants the spices organised so I follow his lead, I hate it when he leaves the lid off the toothpaste so he makes an effort not to do it. Thats sharing and compromise.", "Ok NTA that\u2019s gross.", "Lol... I just realized I commented on your break up post 2 weeks ago.\n\nGirl wyd???\n\n Each of these points really underscores a lack of effort and consideration on his part. It's not just about the clothes; it's about the bigger picture of him not meeting your emotional needs. The fact that he was dismissive when working on the PC together and unresponsive during a deep conversation about your relationship shows a concerning pattern. His approach of wanting to \"try our best\" seems vague and unhelpful, especially when he doesn't engage in meaningful actions or discussions to improve things. It's understandable to feel unfulfilled and unloved in this situation.\n\nThis PC incident and his coldness during your vulnerable conversation are particularly troubling. You guys just came back from a fight, to being mean while doing something that could have been a bonding activity shows a lack of empathy and effort to connect. Even more concerning is his detached attitude during a heartfelt, vulnerable talk. When you're opening up and seeking a deeper connection, his indifference and lack of engagement speak volumes. It's hard to rebuild or work on a relationship when one partner is so emotionally unavailable and dismissive of the other's feelings.\n\nAdditionally, his statement about \"trying our best\" feels like a deflection, especially if his current actions don't align with being better. It's one thing to say you'll try, but it's another to actually show it through your actions. His lack of effort in the present, like being mean over something as simple as fixing a PC or being emotionally distant during serious conversations, contradicts his claim of trying. It's a deflection from addressing the real issues at hand and making tangible changes.", "I think the sad fact is that he has already broken up with you, he just hasn't left. He has checked out of the relationship emotionally. You probably can't come back from this.\n\nI've been here. You want back what you had, and occasionally you see glimpses of it, that make you think it hasn't gone, but those glimpses will probably never be more than occasional. I was never strong enough to leave in these scenarios, I usually got so clingy that they left me. I don't recommend this approach.", " His lack of response during your vulnerable moments is not just concerning, it's a significant red flag in the relationship. When you're sharing your deepest concerns and emotions, the expectation is for your partner to engage, show empathy, and provide support. His dismissive attitude and reluctance to share his own thoughts or feelings undermine the very essence of partnership and emotional connection. This behavior seems like a serious issue in the relationship, and it shows a lack of emotional investment and unwillingness to participate in meaningful communication, which from your previous posts we already know are a problem.\n\nWhat happened to breaking up?", "TLDR he super dismissive of things far deeper than this hahah", "It doesn\u2019t have to be pajamas. There are plenty of other options. He could take his jeans off and sleep in boxers. He could sleep naked. Skin to skin cuddles is always fun. I just think it\u2019s gross to sleep in the same clothes you wore to work, biked in, etc. \n\nHow are we supposed to even have the opportunity to be intimate when he\u2019s sleeping fully clothed?", "Which would be fine if it was solely *his* bed and he could be as gross and unhygienic as he wanted, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s *their* bed, a shared space, and therefore consideration of the other person is required. If he wanted to wear clothes instead of PJs because he finds them more comfortable, then he should meet her halfway and have a clean pair he changes into to sleep in.\n\nOP, NTA at all.", "If he said that pyjamas are uncomfortable then I totally agree with staying in outside clothes. In a relationship there are things you don't really want to do but do it for the sake of your relationship. Now by pyjamas I mean home clothes like home shirts, pants and even normal pyjamas from the store.", "?!?!!??!???", "Then he\u2019s doing it deliberately to prove some kind of point because no human would think that trying to sleep the whole night in a jean jacket is more tolerable than two seconds\u2019 effort of removing the jacket.\n\nHe is not actually more comfortable like that; he\u2019s just trying to show you that you don\u2019t get to have your needs met if he doesn\u2019t want to meet them.", "Jeans,jean jacket...he is insulating himself,that was me for years.Took almost a year for me to stop and eventually be able to sleep and not look like I was camping.You also stated that he would go completely distant for days or even weeks after fights.Thats from not being able to process emotion,which In turn leads to creating a literal barrier(clothes in bed)FWIW,in my case I'm on the spectrum and coping mechanisms often appear very irrational,like this instance", "I know a lot of people are saying that it's this easy task and just a sign of disrespect for not wanting to do this simple thing.  What is simple for one person could be mountain for another.   I sometimes don't change my clothes before bedtime. I have a job with an aircon, and I don't sweat at all, so I don't think I stink or whatever but because of my depression the time I get home a simple task as changing my clothes feels as much as asking another to do a mathematics exam.  You might think the person is just disrespecting you but there could be a legit reason for the behavior. \n\nTake it as you like but it's not always about disrespect or not wanting to make your partner happy.", "Hard disagree. It's not a habit to say no when you've been asked to do something for your partner's comfort.\n\nIf he only forgot it might apply. But he has actively refused. That's ridiculous behavior for an adult", "Pyjamas exist for comfort, not hygiene. If you work a physical job or roll around in mud all day or whatever of course there\u2019s also a grime component, but for most other people the shirt they\u2019ve been wearing for less than 24 hours is not inherently contaminated. Germophobes need to stop normalizing their anxiety; treatment exists and is very effective.", "You say, you fell not loved. I call that a dealbreaker.\n\nAt least concider to behave less contradictory. And yes, repeating your wishes is niot a big deal. You took him like he was. Help him to change", "what does it say that my boyfriend and I also like one piece HAHA", "He ought to be putting his work clothes in the laundry basket every day when he comes home, and then showering.\n\nGoing to bed in his clothes from working in a lab is idiotic, regardless of any precautions he takes at work.", "Give him a blanket on the floor by the door for him to sleep on. Maybe a pillow if you want to be nice.", "Well, depends on the lab. The on emy wife works in is probably one of the cleanest rooms in the town we live in.   \nThat being said!

Also would be kinda stressed about money. \n\nI keep wanting to make excuses like \u201coh he probably just wants to stop having the same conversation and actually enjoy time together\u201d which is something I also want\u2026 but it\u2019s obviously hard for me to move on when he is dismissive and deflects.

My anxiety causes problems sometimes, BUT!!! these specific behaviors are clearly NOT related to my anxiety", "So you don't really even really care that he doesn't change, you just want more intimacy?", "I feel like I\u2019ve thought about it this way - a barrier that\u2019s tied to his emotional distance - but hasn\u2019t been able to articulate it. Interesting. I wonder what the anxiety is.", "Ah that\u2019s true, could be something like that. I interpreted it as them doing it just to spite OP or something. My apologies, i guess the way this was worded just threw me for a loop and made me think that. Still understandable that OP doesn\u2019t like or want it though", "Not if she asks when he's already comfortable. At that point it's more of a pain than it's worth.", "This \u2026 doesn\u2019t surprise me at all with the context of your post and your comments. Ugh, I\u2019m sorry OP!

You're just coping; you're delaying the inevitable, loaning your happiness in the present hoping it pays off in the future, when you'll still just be unhappy.\n\nEach day you stay for reasons like financial convenience or holiday cheer, you're sacrificing your emotional well-being for a comfort that's superficial at best. I gave you breakup advice over a 3 week long fight 3 weeks ago. Since then he yelled at you for asking for help with a PC, and had no opinions on your most vulnerable moments. \n\nTrying to get back on the same page doesn't make much sense when that page has consistently been filled with conflict. It's like trying to read a peaceful story from a book that's only full of arguments and tension. You can't find harmony on a page that's never known it. The effort to align yourselves, while commendable, seems futile if the fundamental narrative of your relationship is one sided emotional labor with no empathy or understanding. \n\nHonestly, it's appalling and a huge red flag that he wouldn't even make eye contact during such a crucial, vulnerable moment. This goes beyond emotional unavailability\u2014it's a glaring sign of disrespect. For him to claim he has no opinion when you're baring your soul? That's not just cold, it's alarmingly dismissive. This kind of behavior screams a lack of basic empathy and connection, which are non-negotiables in any relationship worth its salt. You need to seriously question what you're sticking around for, because this isn't just a rough patch\u2014it's a fundamental breakdown in respect and emotional support. \n\nLogically, it's clear: this situation isn't improving, and your efforts are met with indifference. It's time to cut through the excuses and face the music. Prepare yourself financially and emotionally for the split. This isn't about giving up; it's about making a strategic decision for your own mental health. Dragging this out will only deepen the wounds.

It sounds like you\u2019re already showing up in the relationship and starting to look at yourself as the problem. It\u2019s SO gross that he goes to bed in clothes that he\u2019s worn. For so many reasons! It sounds like you should end your relationship. Too many red flags and it\u2019s not normal to medicate yourself to make things better when he\u2019s barely showing up for you. Also psych meds are great when used properly, but there\u2019s a lot of side effects and withdrawal if the meds don\u2019t work. That\u2019s a BIG decision and will alter your brain chemistry for a person who\u2019s clearly not making you feel happy, fulfilled, seen, loved or appreciated.

The idea you would get on meds for him is crazy. \n\n Given the issues you've described with him, it's clear that the problems in your relationship go beyond your anxiety. Medication should be about your health and peace of mind, not about making you more tolerable or compliant in a situation where the other person's actions are a major source of distress. You deserve a partnership where you're accepted and supported as you are, not one where you feel the need to medicate yourself to cope with the other person's behavior.\n\nRegarding the PC incident, ask yourself, did his yelling feel like love? And his lack of opinions or thoughts during a critical conversation, did that feel like he was putting in effort? It seems like you're trying to get on the 'same page,' but if that page is just him being himself \u2013 which currently involves conflict and emotional neglect \u2013 then what are you aligning with?
