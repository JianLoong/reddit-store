They are one of those wealthy people who worked hard to have what they have and want their children to do the same, and they sadly believe that buying their children things like a camera is a \"luxury\" for which they must work. \n\nShe works as a babysitter sometimes but that's not enough to pay for a camera, and I (28F) know she's saving every penny but it still wasn't enough. So I decided to buy her the camera myself, as a gift for her seventeenth birthday which was a few days ago and she loved the gift she even cried so you can imagine how much she loved it.\n\nThe problem is that when she told her mom (50F) she was furious because she thinks I crossed the stepmother line, that she wanted to buy her her daughter her first professional camera (even though she refused to buy her the camera multiple times because she said she had to work for it) that it wasn't my place to do that, and of course now she got mad at my husband (55M) for no reason too and she wants him to force me to apologize for wanting to take her place (I didn't want to do that, I just wanted to give her a gift that I knew she wanted) but i am not going to apologize and my husband told her that but she is still furious and keeps insisting that what i did was wrong. AITA for having done what I did?\n\n\nedit: My husband knew that I was going to buy her the camera because I told him but he didn't say anything, he just ignored me and said he was going to pretend he didn't hear me. The thing is, his ex uses their children (17F, 13F, 8F) as weapons to hurt him whenever she can, and she waits for any mistake from me or his to attack. I've been in the picture for almost eight years but she still hates me and everything I do is always wrong because no one is a better mother than her. And the truth is that the girls live with us and never see their mother (because she is always busy traveling for work or on vacation with her friends) I am the one who plays the role of mother, I clarify this because many said that I gave her that gift to win her love and it is not like that.

You bought her a birthday gift... it happened to be a camera.  She happened to want a camera, congratulations you've bought a near adult something they wanted.\n\nI mean, it's a bit ridiculous really, as in if you'd bought something of equal value that was not the camera they probably would've been fine about it.  But they've made this camera a \"project\" for some reason.\n\n\"Oh but our child needs to learn the value of monneeyyy\"\n\nShe's 17, if they've not instilled that value at 17 what the feck have they been doing for the last 17 years.", "You kind of buried the lead that you're the much, much, much younger woman that your husband is now married to, and that by doing this thing that was a different style of parenting from what was being promoted, you were directly pitting your step-child's happiness against the wishes of her mom.\n\nThis is really something you could have spoken to the mom about BEFORE you did it. You didn't have to say 'do I have your permission.' You could have just said in advance \"I'm doing this.\" Or had your husband speak to her about. Instead you went behind everyone. And while it sounds like she loved it and the spirit of the gift was in the right place, you are old enough and in enough of a unique position to have been aware of how pissy everyone was going to get.\n\nIf I had to say someone sucks more, the mom sucks more. But c'mon. This is basic step parent stuff here.", "NTA: It was sweet of you to do this for her. She has been trying to earn the camera, saving for a year is great! But I'm more confused about the husband's reaction? Why wouldn't he be happy about his own daughter got for her bday??? As you explained, nothing you can do can happy the bio mom happy so it is what it is on that front.", "NTA. The daughter is 17, not 12. These parents have the best years coming up to deny her of \u201cluxuries\u201d that she\u2019ll have to work for. Lucky girl, she got something she really wanted as a gift from her stepmom (who is 11 years older than her like I am to my little sister). Fun!", "NTA what you do with your money is your business. But you have to put up with the reactions too. You alienated the birth mom and you might have stepped on your husband toes. But you probably improved with step daughter. I don\u2019t really see gifts as a ah territory.", "We really need to interpret your post based on your phrasing. It *appears* that:\n\n* Parents had brushed off her requests for a camera\n* Parents didn't set a simple goal for her to earn the camera (e.g. \"raise X money and we'll match it so you can buy it\")\n\nOn the condition that the parents had no real intention of buying her the camera, NTA.

Her mother didn't tell her daughter at any time that she was going to buy a camera for her. You bought this young lady something she will value and use. You didn't do it to spite anyone.", "NTA - but I'd say it actually depends on the camera. \n\nIt's not cool to undermine a parent when you're the step older sister (the term stepmother seems absurd when applied to someone just 10yrs younger), but if it was a starter $200 dollar camera then you are allowing her to get some experience while leaving the goal for her to get a nice one as something she can work towards.\n\nIt's a hobby that can turn into a career if one is interested enough, so the sooner she starts using a camera the better!", "Mmm this falls in my category of good things that seem to be bead I would say, smartphones nowadays can be cameras and I'm pretty sure she doesn't have a potato phone, so my guess is that the camera was a lesson they wanted to teach their daughter, so by skipping their authority I would say soft TA, BUT and it's a big but, the mother doesn't seem to be complaining for the correct reason though, the girl seems to be put under too much pressure I believe, unfortunately they are her parents and the what are teaching her is responsability, in a slightly tough way, but that could be because they want her to learn to manage her finances since she will be getting quite some money from them in the future.", "NTA", "I\u2019m gonna go ahead and kick this off with a big ol NTA esp if there was zero evidence pointing that mom was gonna buy her one. I mean unless you spent like north of $600 on it then it was way over the line in which case then yes YTA. I don\u2019t see where you mentioned to your husband prior to giving it thats what you bought. In which case that also points to you feeling like you knew you were doing something a little sneaky and pulling the ol StepMom buy her love trick. Which does NOT work bt-dubs.

I hope it becomes a lifelong hobby for has as it has been for me.", "NTA if you didn\u2019t mean to undermine the parents. \n\nClearly the daughter has been working for the camera. You bought her a gift that her mom was refusing to buy her.   \n\nI think it might be good to apologize that you crossed a boundary but make it clear that you didn\u2019t know she wanted to buy the first camera or mean to undermine her. (As long as that is true.)", "YTA I know you don\u2019t want it to be a reality but the truth of the matter is that your husbands daughter will never see you as mom. You disrespected her actual mom. She\u2019s still a minor and I can empathize with her mom wanting to make sure she works for those luxuries. You\u2019re not a wealthy person so you wouldn\u2019t understand. When things come easy, that is not realistic or healthy. I am going to ignore the fact that you\u2019ve been with this man for 8 years but his youngest with his ex is 8 years old? One can come to the assumption that you\u2019re not telling us the full story here", "NTA\n\nIt was her birthday!\n\nYou have taken a parental role for 8 years.\n\nBio mom could have given her a camera years ago but chose not to.\n\nThis is ridiculous.\n\nFFS, I got a camera when I was 11. Loved the thing to death, too. Still have it displayed. I think I'm on maybe camera 6 or 7 now? Never stopped taking pictures. And you can find cheaper versions. If she likes photography, she has more time to practice in HS.\n\nHer father knew and quietly condoned it. Her mother is being weird. She can still buy her a better camera for a next birthday.", "ESH\n\nFirst off, let me just point out that a camera is in fact a luxury. You purchased a gift for someone else's kid without consulting them knowing full well both parents wanted her to save her own money to buy it. Second, she most certainly is making enough to save up. It just takes a long time/ she needs to stop spending money on other things. Even if the camera was $300, she could have saved enough to buy it after saving for a few months. Let's say she makes $10 an hour..... That's 30 hours of work...... If she works an average of 2.5 hours a week at $10 an hour, she'd have enough for the camera in 3 months. So please, cut the crap about her \"not being able\" to save up. \n\nMom an also an ah for saying that she wanted to buy it for her knowing full well she never intended to so do. The only one in the clear here is your husband. Cause he's right. He should want his kid to save up money and EARN luxuries in life. Not only does it teach them how to save money, it also teaches them to value their things a lot more.", "YTA big time. You should have either respected the parents\u2019 rules on this OR gotten their permission before buying it as a birthday gift. \n\nOh, and babysitting pays plenty if she\u2019s actually babysitting.", "ESH\n\nThe stepdaughter for asking for the camera even though she knew the rule. The mom and dad for not cutting the stepdaughter any slack because who the hell can pay for a pro-grade camera at wages someone that age can make? And OP is an AH for not sticking with the family rule.", "Reluctant YTA.  I'm personally glad you saw that the parental rules are too harsh and bought it for her.  However, I do think you technically crossed a line by doing something the parents had given an express \"no\" on. Maybe there's a compromise to be had where stepdaughter works off the cost of the gift by taking some family photos, etc?", "YTA\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting her to work to earn the camera. The camera is a want - especially since most cell phones have a decent camera and she already owns one - not a need making it a good goal for her. It would teach her some important lessons to work towards the goal of a camera. \n\nYou undermined her parents for no good reason.", "YTA - you intentionally undermined her parents behind their backs.", "YTA. I mean, were her parents kind of being sticklers? Yes. But you knew what their wishes were for their daughter and you decided to go over their heads just because you didn't agree. You didn't have a right to do that.", "Soft yta. If dad and mom made a parenting decision you as stepmom crossed a line. You decided you knew better than her parents. You needed permission to make a decision like that, at least from your husband. I get your intentions were good, but you crossed a line.", "Perhaps mum should be less concerned about teaching her kids wealth management and more concerned with actually being around to parent and spend time with them. You can't expect another woman to pick up your slack most of the time then deny her the ability to buy the kids a gift of her choosing.", "YTA don't undermind the parents like that. If they want her to work for it then she needs to work for it. It was a lesson around that camera\n\nAlso, I don't believe your edit, you only added all that after people called you a jerk. Also you hide your age, 28. Not to mention been with him 8 years and the youngest kid with the ex is 8. I smell something wrong", "You did overstep, since her parents have told her she needs to work for it. I'm guessing part of the reason is because you're closer to her age than theirs and I can't see or understand the valid reasons they have for that choice.
