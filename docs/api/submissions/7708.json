They are one of those wealthy people who worked hard to have what they have and want their children to do the same, and they sadly believe that buying their children things like a camera is a \"luxury\" for which they must work. \n\nShe works as a babysitter sometimes but that's not enough to pay for a camera, and I (28F) know she's saving every penny but it still wasn't enough. So I decided to buy her the camera myself, as a gift for her seventeenth birthday which was a few days ago and she loved the gift she even cried so you can imagine how much she loved it.\n\nThe problem is that when she told her mom (50F) she was furious because she thinks I crossed the stepmother line, that she wanted to buy her her daughter her first professional camera (even though she refused to buy her the camera multiple times because she said she had to work for it) that it wasn't my place to do that, and of course now she got mad at my husband (55M) for no reason too and she wants him to force me to apologize for wanting to take her place (I didn't want to do that, I just wanted to give her a gift that I knew she wanted) but i am not going to apologize and my husband told her that but she is still furious and keeps insisting that what i did was wrong. AITA for having done what I did?\n\n\nedit: My husband knew that I was going to buy her the camera because I told him but he didn't say anything, he just ignored me and said he was going to pretend he didn't hear me. The thing is, his ex uses their children (17F, 13F, 8F) as weapons to hurt him whenever she can, and she waits for any mistake from me or his to attack. I've been in the picture for almost eight years we have a baby and another on the way we are already family but she still hates me and everything I do is always wrong because no one is a better mother than her. And the truth is that the girls live with us and never see their mother (because she is always busy traveling for work or on vacation with her friends) I am the one who plays the role of mother, I clarify this because many said that I gave her that gift to win her love and it is not like that.

You bought her a birthday gift... it happened to be a camera.  She happened to want a camera, congratulations you've bought a near adult something they wanted.\n\nI mean, it's a bit ridiculous really, as in if you'd bought something of equal value that was not the camera they probably would've been fine about it.  But they've made this camera a \"project\" for some reason.\n\n\"Oh but our child needs to learn the value of monneeyyy\"\n\nShe's 17, if they've not instilled that value at 17 what the feck have they been doing for the last 17 years.", "You kind of buried the lead that you're the much, much, much younger woman that your husband is now married to, and that by doing this thing that was a different style of parenting from what was being promoted, you were directly pitting your step-child's happiness against the wishes of her mom.\n\nThis is really something you could have spoken to the mom about BEFORE you did it. You didn't have to say 'do I have your permission.' You could have just said in advance \"I'm doing this.\" \\[edit: thank you commenters! yes, the husband played a role in this/knew in advance so he owns some of this too.\\] Or had your husband speak to her about. Instead you went behind ~~everyone~~ the mom. And while it sounds like the recipient loved the camera and the spirit of the gift was in the right place, you are old enough and in enough of a unique position to have been aware of how pissy everyone was going to get.\n\nIf I had to say someone sucks more, the mom sucks more. But c'mon. This is basic step parent stuff here.", "NTA: It was sweet of you to do this for her. She has been trying to earn the camera, saving for a year is great! But I'm more confused about the husband's reaction? Why wouldn't he be happy about his own daughter got for her bday???

If she likes photography, she has more time to practice in HS.\n\nHer father knew and quietly condoned it. Her mother is being weird. She can still buy her a better camera for a next birthday.", "ESH\n\nFirst off, let me just point out that a camera is in fact a luxury. You purchased a gift for someone else's kid without consulting them knowing full well both parents wanted her to save her own money to buy it. Second, she most certainly is making enough to save up. It just takes a long time/ she needs to stop spending money on other things. Even if the camera was $300, she could have saved enough to buy it after saving for a few months. Let's say she makes $10 an hour..... That's 30 hours of work...... If she works an average of 2.5 hours a week at $10 an hour, she'd have enough for the camera in 3 months. So please, cut the crap about her \"not being able\" to save up. \n\nMom an also an ah for saying that she wanted to buy it for her knowing full well she never intended to so do. The only one in the clear here is your husband. Cause he's right. He should want his kid to save up money and EARN luxuries in life.

However, I do think you technically crossed a line by doing something the parents had given an express \"no\" on. Maybe there's a compromise to be had where stepdaughter works off the cost of the gift by taking some family photos, etc?", "YTA\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting her to work to earn the camera. The camera is a want - especially since most cell phones have a decent camera and she already owns one - not a need making it a good goal for her. It would teach her some important lessons to work towards the goal of a camera. \n\nYou undermined her parents for no good reason.", "YTA - you intentionally undermined her parents behind their backs.", "YTA. I mean, were her parents kind of being sticklers? Yes. But you knew what their wishes were for their daughter and you decided to go over their heads just because you didn't agree. You didn't have a right to do that.", "Soft yta. If dad and mom made a parenting decision you as stepmom crossed a line. You decided you knew better than her parents. You needed permission to make a decision like that, at least from your husband. I get your intentions were good, but you crossed a line.", "Perhaps mum should be less concerned about teaching her kids wealth management and more concerned with actually being around to parent and spend time with them. You can't expect another woman to pick up your slack most of the time then deny her the ability to buy the kids a gift of her choosing.", "YTA don't undermind the parents like that.
