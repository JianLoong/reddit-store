That's very small of her, she's the asshole and the fact that you've talked to your son about this and how he's most likely seen her make these comments makes him an asshole too. \n\nI firmly believe that you don't marry someone because they get along with your family, but that doesn't mean they get to treat your family like shit.", "NTA\n\nHow on earth could your son be justifying this behavior?", "NTA - what the hell? Who made her the boss of what women should and shouldn't do or what does and doesn't count as contribution??

GTFO \n\nAnd your son as an AH because he doesn\u2019t want to deal with the fact his wife is rude AF, and instead is making it your problem because to him that\u2019s easier than addressing the real problem.

Your DIL is only a girl and needs to grow up and learn what basic respect is and how to give it.\n\nYou tried to be polite about her disrespect by addressing it with your son and she still doesn't seem to understand.

If your lifestyle is not for her then fine, but she doesn't need to be so aggressive and crass in her dislike of it. It has no effect on her, and therefore she needs to shut up about it.

I don\u2019t even know why he married her, the first backhanded comment my significant other did against my parents, I would be the one to make them cry with the verbal beating I would give them. \n\nOn another note, your son will be miserable with that kind of bitter woman, misery loves company as they say.
