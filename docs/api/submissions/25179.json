She's a total AH.  Just because you don't conform to her \"Business Focus\" personality doesn't mean you've done anything wrong.  What you and your husband have works for the two of you AND you volunteer for the community.   Whether  it pays or not doesn't take away from your commitment and responsibility you show to others.  DIL is a piece of work.\n\nWhat does husband say to  all of this?", "NTA. Holy crap. She's putting you down for being a SAHM for what? Shits and gigs? That's very small of her, she's the asshole and the fact that you've talked to your son about this and how he's most likely seen her make these comments makes him an asshole too. \n\nI firmly believe that you don't marry someone because they get along with your family, but that doesn't mean they get to treat your family like shit.", "NTA\n\nHow on earth could your son be justifying this behavior?", "NTA - what the hell? Who made her the boss of what women should and shouldn't do or what does and doesn't count as contribution?? She needs to keep her condescending comments and judgements to herself.", "NTA - somebody welcomes you into their home, cooks you a meal, and your response is back handed comments like that?  GTFO \n\nAnd your son as an AH because he doesn\u2019t want to deal with the fact his wife is rude AF, and instead is making it your problem because to him that\u2019s easier than addressing the real problem.  Coward for letting somebody come treat his own mother like that and just watching it happen.", "NTA. Tell your son they are not allowed back in your house until she apologizes.", "NTA. Your DIL is only a girl and needs to grow up and learn what basic respect is and how to give it.\n\nYou tried to be polite about her disrespect by addressing it with your son and she still doesn't seem to understand. A verbal slap in the face seems to have been necessary to call her attention to her bad behavior.\n\nYou just know she's off somewhere crying, \"I didn't do anything but tell the truth!!! I'm such a truthful person...why is that offensive?? What did I do?\"\n\nShe doesn't understand relationship dynamics and how a person can contribute more than just money and that is often just as valuable as money.\n\nThese people need to grow up.", "Whoa no - you are NTA for not taking shit  from her. What a rude person she is", "NTA, but your son and his wife sure are. Your son should never tolerate that kind of BS from his wife.  \nFor the wedding gift, I would have said, \"My contribution was wrapping it and bringing it, but since it's not really from me this never happened\" and snatch the gift back.", "NTA.  DIL is extraordinarily rude!  How dare she suggest that a gift from you and your husband was only from him, outrageous!  No doubt you worked hard to make a home cooked meal and instead of gratitude you received contempt.", "NTA.  She is being rude as hell and shouldn't be in your home again until she apologizes.  \n\nEven if she thinks that you are a deadbeat freeloader, she needs to learn to keep that shit opinion to herself when talking with you or in your house.", "NTA. Your son and husband should be involved in letting her know she can't treat you like this.", "NTA. Whether or not you work and how you share finances is between you and your husband and is none of her business. If she was previously unaware that such comments are rude, she's aware now. You are 100% right, but if you care to salvage your relationship with your son or try to build one with her, it may be in your best interest to offer a sit down with them both, give her the benefit of the doubt that she was possibly raised by wolves who never taught her such comments are out of bounds, and ask for a fresh start. Remember that this woman will likely bear your grandchildren and will have a great deal of control over what type of relationship you get to have with them.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA\n\nThis DIL sounds like a genuine *asshole*.", "NTA she is rude and disrespectful. If your lifestyle is not for her then fine, but she doesn't need to be so aggressive and crass in her dislike of it. It has no effect on her, and therefore she needs to shut up about it. Also your son is disappointing as he shouldn't allow her to speak to you that way or condone it! He should have let her know he didn't accept that behaviour", "NTA.

Who cares if you didn\u2019t physically pay for the gift? You had the thought so it did come from you too. I would be taking that gift back. Being a SAHM isn\u2019t just laying around. It\u2019s doing laundry, grocery shopping, cleaning, etc. Don\u2019t invite your son or your DIL back until they are ready to apologize. Although your DIL seems set on being an ah", "Wow NTA at all. Unless there\u2019s anything you\u2019re not telling us that you\u2019ve done for her to resent you that way. However just from context here she\u2019s definitely a resentful AH and needs to mind her own business.", "NTA: every one makes different life choices. Some are fulfilled via professional life, some via homemaking and volunteering if they are fortunate enough to afford to be able to do it.", "She's incredibly rude...NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour son needs o grow a backbone and tell her to be civilized. I don\u2019t even know why he married her, the first backhanded comment my significant other did against my parents, I would be the one to make them cry with the verbal beating I would give them. \n\nOn another note, your son will be miserable with that kind of bitter woman, misery loves company as they say. It might take months or years, but just wait, he will be 100% unhappy with this kind of woman.", "HEY! Chewing ass is a honed skill! You did your job\u2026 that\u2019s 22 years of work experience you just laid out for her free of charge. Now, kick back pour yourself a glass of wine and trade a stock or something easy.
