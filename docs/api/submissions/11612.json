{"id": 11612, "submission_id": "11jwhij", "title": "AITA for telling my SIL not to send my niece to stay with us because I can't stick to her rules?", "selftext": "My (35F) husband and I have a daughter, Clara (9), and he has a sister, Val, who has a daughter, Ana, also 9. We live in different countries but Ana and Clara have always been close growing up. Val and her partner, James, work full time and couldn't take Ana on a holiday over the easter break, so Val suggested Ana come and visit us.\n\nFirst of all, I have absolute respect for Val and James's parenting choices. They are doing what they feel is right and they're raising a lovely little girl. However, we have different parenting styles. For example, Val will only allow Ana to eat \"child appropriate\" food, meaning she is not allowed to have \"expensive\" food where we've always let Clara eat/order what she wants. Conversely, Ana is allowed to eat fast food and Clara isn't. Ana has an allowance, Clara does not. Val and James insist on Ana doing chores, even on holiday, that's not something we ask of Clara. While we've always taught her to be self sufficient, it's not productive or necessary for her to do chores at home or on holiday. Ana is allowed to dabble in social media, Clara is not. Ana is allowed to dress in a way I wouldn't let Clara. All of us respect each other as parents, so the different attitudes has never been an issue between us.\n\nHowever, while I respect Val and James's choices, they're not choices I'd make, and some of their rules I wouldn't feel comfortable enforcing. I don't feel that it's fair of me to tell Ana what she can order at a restaurant, or have her vacuuming my apartment. I don't feel comfortable taking a child out in crop tops wearing make up, but I don't want to tell Ana what to wear either. If Val were there I wouldn't say a word, but asking Ana to follow rules I don't agree with is the line for me. I explained to Val that if Ana visits, we need to find some compromises because it's not feasible for me to manage the two girls so differently, but Val was adamant that her rules need to remain 100% consistent. I said if we can't reach a middle ground it is better that she doesn't send Ana to visit.\n\nVal is now angry at me, saying I've ruined Ana's holiday and that it's selfish of me. She's also saying how I must think she's a terrible mother if I'm so opposed to everything she does for her daughter, which isn't the case at all. It's been going back and forth for days and I guess Val told Ana because now Clara is upset that Ana won't be allowed to come. I really thought I was doing the right thing by admitting I feel out of my depth. My mum and brother thinks it was harsh to tell Val Anna shouldn't come and that even if I'm not used to those rules Ana is so it wouldn't have been a big deal for her to follow them while at our house. My husband says everyone breaks the rules a bit on holiday and that I really didn't need to tell Val upfront, but I would never trust someone with my daughter if I found out they did that to me.

Your SIL is insisting that you follow her rules. That simply does not work. \n\nVal can either send her daughter to you under your conditions or keep her daughter in her home. Either way, the choice (or blame) is 100% hers.", "You are not an AH but also you are slightly an AH. if Ana is a lovely girl she probably wouldn't be that hard to parent even with a different parenting style, i do think that if she is over she should definitely be following more of your rules such as no social media, no fast food. if Ana offers to do chores let her do something small as this is part of her routine, but don't suggest it if not brought up as she is on holiday. The girls already know how different their lives are if they are close, and unless you try you will never know what the week may bring.", "NTA, at the end of the day it's your house and your rules, and there's a few ways this scenario could've played out:\n\n1. You enforce your own rules = Val and Ana are upset\n\n2. You enforce two sets of rules at the same time = Clara feeling jealous about the things Ana is allowed to do, and Ana feeling jealous of the things Clara doesn't have to do\n\n3. You enforce Val's rules only = Clara is upset about going back to the old rules once Ana is gone.\n\nThose were the main one's I could think of, but honestly (based on everyone's reactions at the end), it definitely feels like a situation where you'd be damned if you do and damned if you didn't, no matter what you decided.", "NTA- you were honestly and if they still push it allow her to come visit and she knows the rules so if she chooses to follow them great and as long as she doesn\u2019t break your rules just mention it to the parents like hey I know this is a rule for your daughter she didn\u2019t follow it and it\u2019s not my place.", "NTA.

A nine year old posting on social media, with a list of chores, dressing like a 13 year old while not letting her pick her own food is just not things I would be willing to go along with.

I\u2019m a firm believer that the rules of the house being visited are the rules that need to be respected.  So on the one hand, Val is definitely TA for insisting all her rules be followed - especially since she\u2019s shipping her daughter off to vacay at your house for an extended time without planning to be present herself. Your house. Your rules. \n\nWhen my kids and their friends are with us or in our home then my rules are THE rules. If my kids are visiting someone else\u2019s home or under the watchful eye of another parent - then those rules apply. If I don\u2019t like their rules, then I don\u2019t let my kiddos go - or I make it clear to my kids that they are not to participate in the \u201clater curfew\u201d or activity being suggested if it goes against our rules and I feel particularly strongly about it. They need ti check in with me. I\u2019ve never ever had a parent disrespect that.  \n\nOn the other hand\u2026she\u2019s your niece.  Couldn\u2019t you just have let it alone and when she visits, gently suggest she change if what she\u2019s wearing doesn\u2019t fit where you\u2019re going?  And if you don\u2019t want her having fast food then don\u2019t take her to fast food restaurants.  Simple. She can order off the menu of where your family chooses to go.  I can\u2019t imagine her mom is suggesting you all go out of your way to make sure  Ana has fast food at every meal. \n\nA little less rigidity on both sides would make this a much easier and more fun visit!", "NTA, it is quite easy to explain to Ana that \"This is your aunt's house you will have your holiday and you will follow her rules\" - it is for two weeks only.

They can't really expect you to change your normal rules with your kid and they can't really expect you to say okay Ana can but Clara can't (or vice versa). I would understand if it was something really serious like letting their kid get a tattoo or eat something they're allergic to but lifestyle choices are a bit much to push on another family.\n\nNTA, but you should try to compromise as much as possible, cousin time is important, I always valued my holidays with cousins.", "NTA\n\nMy aunt and uncle had similar differences in child-rearing \"rules\" than my parents.

She needs to learn to compromise and be an example for her daughter. \n\nAlso, kids need to learn, that some setting needs certain behavior. If not for Val's stubbornness, I think it would be okay to ask Ann follow your home setting and minimize make-up etc. It's the same courtesy when you visit foreign country and smth that is common in your homeland is not okay in this country, you are expected not to do it while you stay, no?", "I would have just taken her and let the girl do what she wanted and have fun. it's only a week.

She'll bring her own clothes. \n\nI had an aunt that I stayed with at the same age and honestly it was the best thing for me- I saw how my cousin ( a couple years older than me) carried herself and took care of herself, she was independent,  It helped me realize that my little family home life was not how it is everywhere. \n\nParents shouldn't be the only influence in a kids life.

You can tell her she has no chores at your house & you can eat at home, etc. I suspect your real reason is that you don\u2019t respect their choices & you don\u2019t want the kids comparing notes because your daughter may want to do what Ana does instead of following your rules. Social media? Clothing choices? You\u2019re fighting a losing battle since Clara will inevitably meet other kids whose families live by different rules. \n\nBy the way, you\u2019re wrong about not making Clara do age appropriate chores.

So, using her argument, you could argue that she thinks you are a terrible mother since she is opposed to your rules.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you recognized ahead of time that you would not feel comfortable following Val\u2019s rules without her present. I would also not want to take a nine year old out in makeup and crop tops, and I would absolutely not have a visiting child do chores in my house. Having different rules for the girls is fine when both sets of parents are present to enforce their own rules, but if she is going to send her kid to you without her present she has to anticipate a bit of slacking on her rules.\n\nIt\u2019s also very manipulative of her to tell the kids about this to try and get them upset at you when it is *her* rules that are making this trip undoable.", "NTA.

So do I, but I don't cook or do laundry on a daily basis, and I didn't as a child. If I needed to, I could, and to me that's what matters.\n\nRe social media, I don't mind her having it when she's older, but at 9 years old I don't want her posting pictures/videos of herself on the internet. She has access to my social media on shared devices so if she wants to watch TikToks she can, but posting is not something she needs to be doing at this age. Same with clothes. When she's a teenager and she knows what it means to have grown men objectifying her, why they do that and what the risks are, she can decide if she wants to expose herself to that kind of attention, and if she does I will have no problem with it. Even I wear revealing clothes sometimes. But at 9 years old, I don't need men rubber-necking at her in daisy dukes, I don't think it's fair to her because she doesn't know what that's about.\n\nI respect *every* parent's choice to parent their child how they want.

I wouldn't dream of enforcing the dress code I might have for my daughter on one of her friends, just because she's staying over with us. I would have no problem explaining that to my daughter at all. Kids understand parents all have different rules and values. Yes, my house, my rules, but kids are allowed some autonomy and do not have to park their identity at the door just because they are visiting. I don't like wearing low-cut tops myself - but that doesn't mean I hand my friends a hoodie once they enter my house. I do ask them to take off their shoes, because I believe it to be hygienic (it's a cultural thing). There's a difference here. \n\nThe kid would be a guest in my house - I am responsible for her safety and well-being while she is here, but not her moral education. I wouldn't go out of my way to order something for her that I would not allow my daughter to have, but I would not stop her paying for it with her own money. Just like I'd always cook vegetarian food for my friends, because I am vegetarian, but I would not stop them from eating the meat they've brought from home. That's overstepping.", "...you guys don't change your own bedding? \ud83d\ude2d", "Why would you want to know?", "Stay the course. NTA\n\nYou've asked to communicate and compromise. Your SIL doesn't want to communicate or compromise.\n\nIn fact, she's purposefully misinterpreting what you've asked for. Now, you'll know exactly how she'll react if something goes wrong, or if a rule gets broken. She'll basically yell at you and avoid any kind of serious communication.\n\nAnd if some rules can be broken during the holidays, that's fine, but you just need to know what they are. You're not asking for much.\n\nFor instance, when their daughter goes to school, or goes on holiday, does she have to vacuum the school? Or does she really vacuum the hotel?  And what about a restaurant? Does she vacuum that? No, right?\n\nDo they really expect you to enforce a rule that they wouldn't ask anyone else to enforce outside of their home? To me, that comes off as kind of weird and controlling. It's your home, not theirs. Guests do not vacuum your home (unless it's an AirBnB or something).\n\nOn the flip side, have you spoken to your daughter? Would she be willing to accept some of those extra rules just for two weeks? Perhaps your 9 year old daughter is more mature than your SIL and she may be willing to compromise on some of those things. Thought, don't ask her to vacuum, scratch that one off.\n\nAs to the clothing, that issue could create a logistical issue. Will the other girl have enough clothes that you would consider acceptable? And can you not at least relax that rule when they're at home? When they go out, I understand. But when home, isn't that different? Also, is it cold/hot where you're located? Do you really think there is a high risk of them wearing skimpy outfits in your current climate/weather?", "I like you.

So I know this post will probably get downvoted and that's fine, but I think you both could have relaxed a little for the sake of these two little girls getting to see each other and having a fun week together (which doesn't even happen that often.)
