I don't know what country you live in.  But no civilized country I know has such a restriction.  Here in the US most universities have counseling services available to all students.  And being unable to leave the country if you're diagnosed with a mental illness...  MAYBE China or other totalitarian regimes do that but I've not heard of any.  \n\nMore likely, she's sane enough to know that how shes acts is not normal, and knows that if you go to a therapist that therapist will tell you that she's abusive.  And she doesn't want that, or as she'd put it if confronted, 'doesn't want some quack filling your head with garbage'.  \n\nI say get your stuff in order, go to university, and then put them in the rear view mirror.  Limited contact / information diet while in school, then maybe no contact once you get a job and a place to live.", "NTA - she is taking out consequences for her mistakes on you, she shouldn\u2019t be lying about taxes", "Sadly I\u2019m from Myanmar. Even China would not do this and I know because I\u2019m half Chinese. My mother is also Chinese but she has many toxic beliefs. My Burmese father doesn\u2019t do much either. He\u2019s so absent in my life."]}
