Left to his own devices, he would have long ago found himself a quiet spot and crossed the rainbow bridge. I have seen supposed animal lovers do this to their animals many times.

I think this might help your case if they agree with you.", "NTA. I'm pretty much a misanthropic hermit who only hangs out with animals and doesn't eat meat, and I'd let that poor old guy sleep at this stage, too. It absolutely is selfish of your SO to keep him suffering such a poor QoL, and I am sure you're right that she's doing it for herself, not for him. You're NTA. Stand your ground.

I understand how hard that decision is to make, it literally destroys you. My family hoped that our pup would pass peacefully in the night but she was one stubborn dog and just wouldn\u2019t let go. Her mind appeared to be completely there but her body just did not work anymore. Made the decision all the more difficult but her quality of life just wasn\u2019t worth continuing. \n\nI don\u2019t know how you worded it, but I would bring up the subject again as tactfully as you can. It\u2019s so hard. You have to show her you\u2019re empathetic, tell her you understand, but remind her that this dog is not living how a dog is meant to live anymore.

Do they feel the dog still has a good-enough quality of life? If the vet recommends putting him to rest, I would be more on your side. I wonder if she just cannot let him go.

You truly seem like you want him dead to reduce your own inconvieniece. Fuck your carpets. If you actually care about your partner, help her care for the dog or approach the conversation from a place of compassion. I'm not surprised she exploded. What's your plan? If shes not home and you are, are you just going to leave this elderly dog in his own soil? That's sick. You come across as an undesirable partner.\n\nIf this was my dog I would let go for the dogs best interest after having a quality of life assessment done with the vet and a discussion of whether we can improve his life.

Also.. even the diapers are an infection risk, not to mention not changing and cleaning.\n\nBut you are absolutely right, loving human thing would be to let the dog go.", "YTA. Is he enjoying food and company still? Is he free of unmanageable pain? Are you capable of caring for him collectively? If so, you\u2019d be putting him down out of sheer convenience to yourself, not for him in any way. \n\nI sure hope you don\u2019t lose any function as you age, sheesh.

YTA. The fact you argued that she needed to kill her dog and threw the lease in her face is pretty fucked up. I assume you two decided to move in together so why make it seem like it's just your place? You're making her a guest in her own home. \n\nThe fact that you argue the dog is suffering which is why you want to put the dog down and then go on to mention you won't help out with the dog shows you didn't want to help in the first place. If you really cared about the dog suffering you'd want to reduce that suffering until it died instead of ignoring it. That really shows that you don't want to take care of the dog and suffering has nothing to do with it.", "NAH", "NTA. At some point, we do have to let our beloved animals go. It is absolutely hard.

This can be really heartbreaking and difficult. I've seen this happen with my own family and it's really hard to see an animal suffering when a person just isn't ready to let go. It needs to be approached with caution and  sensitivity and you should encourage her maybe to have a real conversation with her vet about his quality of life.  But it seems like you care more about your apartment then the actual suffering of the dog which makes you an asshole.", "NTA time for her beagle to sleep.\n\nIf you have a spare 50k you could get viagen to clone her beagle.", "You're selfish... you don't want to clean up after someone else's pet. That's not cruel, that's simply being human.\n\nI think you're projecting your dislike of cleaning up after the dog to the dog itself. If he can wag his tail and wiggle into his owner's arms, then he is unlikely to be suffering. When my dog was suffering and I had to have her euthanized, she didn't wag her tail or wiggle in my arms even though she knew it was me holding her.\n\nTell her that you genuinely believe it would be better for him BUT he is her dog, not yours. However, you will not be doing these things for her. Possible suggest crating him until she is home since he doesn't really move around much but insist on a pet deposit from her to cover whatever your landlord will want due to the damage. \\[Crating is not cruel.\\]\n\nEquivalent judgement - either both or neither of you are A H.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One case: a woman with two fake hips, a fake knee, multiple spine surgeries, etc. Her sons refused to let her leave and she spent the last years of her life being forced to live, all the while she was begging to be allowed to die with dignity. When we finally convinced her sons to sign the release for palliative care (comfort measures only, no more curative treatment), she fell asleep and stayed that way until she passed five days later. Another: a man with severely advanced Parkinson's. His wife refused to let him have strong pain killers or to put him in a proper care facility where he could be looked after 24/7 by trained professionals, but was too old to care for him herself. He had an open, necrotized pressure ulcer that was so deep you could see his spine, and three more just about to open. She forced him to hold on and live even though he only got changed and turned twice a day when caretakers came to his house (they had plenty of money for proper care btw). He passed a few days ago and all his caretakers and kids acknowledge that he was ready and his wife had forced him to go on for too long. He no longer feels pain and doesnt have to suffer the indignity of some nurses gagging at the smell coming from his wound.\n\n It is hard to let the ones we love go, and although your grandma was fine with it, many elderly in conditions like this dog would prefer to go than be at the mercy of caretakers and have their dignity taken from them. Even if the caregivers are the sweetest and their actions are only done with the gentlest touch, it is humiliating to live in such circumstances. \n\nAs a second note, I had a very old dog I let go in September. She has Cushings (her tumor was on the pituitary gland) and had begun stroking. After what I assume was stroke number three, I let her go. I would have done it after the first but didnt recognize what was happening. Had a final day full of cuddles, ice cream, and lazing by the river where the grass smelled strong. It nearly killed me to let her go, and I still cry about it when I let myself think of her final days, but I made the right choice. That is no way for a dog to live. \n\nFinally, I do agree that the bf should help with the dog, as it isn't fair to leave him sitting in filth all day. But he should only do the bare minimum (diapers and water) and leave the rest to his gf to do before and after work. The dog doesn't need to be walked every few hours anyway, and eating twice a day is reasonable.

I was a wreck when she died because I lived with her for a portion of my life. I could tell the last time I saw her she didn't have as much energy as she used to. Can't remember seeing her able to get around without a wheel chair or not needing adult diapers. She wasn't blind or deaf but was always in pain. I wasn't surprised when she died.

This isn\u2019t the dog\u2019s fault and even though your frustrations with cleaning up after the dog are valid, it is cruel to take it out on them.\n- You mention the dog has serious health issues, which insinuates that the vet has seen and diagnosed such, but (by your account of the situation) your girlfriend doesn\u2019t seem to be doing the due diligence to confirm with that vet if any of the ailments listed are reducing the dog\u2019s quality of life, likely out of fear of the answer. If she\u2019s had the dog his entire life, again, the fear of the loss is valid, but it is cruel to not be doing everything in her power to ensure his quality of life if she is insistent that it isn\u2019t time yet.\nIf either one of you are unwilling to do these things for a dog in the end stages of life, you are not prepared to be dog owners.\n\nThe fact that this is a fight you both seem to be keen to have instead of a heartbroken conversation about how you can support the dog and each other doesn\u2019t bode well for your relationship.", "NTA. I had a dog that was 15 years old. Suffering like that. Horrible quality of life, blind, in I time t, and barely moved. One night I left the door unlocked and he managed to push it and I found him floating in the pool. I think he committed suicide. Granted he was blind and May have just stumbled into the water.  I felt horrible and still mourn his loss.", "NTA I hate when people keep animals alive in pain and discomfort because they can't let go.

Your girlfriend is being cruel", "YTA. Mainly because your first thought was the carpets, AND you're willing to let the dog suffer/get UTIs until you get your way. Plus pressuring someone to euthanize their dog. Even if it's the right thing to do, she needs time to come to terms with it and in the meantime you are foolishly turning it into a battle of wills. If she caves to your pressure before she is emotionally ready, she will resent you forever. If you \"win\" this argument, you will lose.\n\nThat said, I agree with those who suggested a quality of life evaluation from a vet. The smart thing for you to do is apologize, acknowledge her feelings, and then say that if a vet says the dog has a good quality of life you will abide by that, providing the vet gets the full picture. Emphasize that this is about the dog, without implying that she's selfish or a bad dog owner. \n\nThis is an exercise in empathy and forethought. Ten years from now, what do you want her to remember about the time her beloved dog was reaching his last days and your part in it? Act accordingly.", "NTA, this is a horrible way to live as a dog. The humane thing to do is to euthanize him since his quality of life is gone. Our dog loooooved sleeping. Could spend all day on the couch. But then he had water in his lungs. Doc said he\u2018s basically have to always stand, no more lying down so he wouldn\u2018t drown. We called my sister who is the legal owner and she decided it was time to let him go.

If the dog is too old to live it would be better for him healthwise to let him go.", "No AH, and I know that that's probably the unpopular opinion. I'm not saying the dog should or shouldn't be put to sleep. But, if the dog is still affectionate and enjoying its time, I personally think you should let it keep fighting. However, if the dog really is suffering and in pain and has little to no joy in its days, then the right decision is probably talk to a vet about whether or not it is the right choice to put him down. Definitely talk to a vet regardless, get their opinion on his quality of life. Pets really do become a major part of our lives and parting with them is incredibly difficult, especially when you're the one to make the choice to put them down. No one likes to feel responsible for their dog no longer living and if your girlfriend ends up putting him down, Definitely be supportive of her.", "Unfortunately the vets I've run into will discuss at lengths the options to save the animal.  They won't mention putting the pet down until you do then usually in my experience they seem relieved I asked about it and picked that option.

My senior dog kept having incontinence because she had degenerative mylopathy and she was a big dog. We couldn't easily take care of her incontinence issues anymore and she had frequent UTIs. She had been through so many different antibiotics and developed a resistance. This can happen with frequent incontinence, especially if you can't frequently change dog diapers or let the dog out every hour at minimum. \n\nWe basically had a choice to 1. Humanely let her go, on our own terms, surrounded by those she was loved by 2. Let the infection get worse and take her life or 3. If she managed to fight the infection, let the degenerative mylopathy slowly paralyze her and make her quality of life worse. \n\nI will say soft NAH though. I totally understand where OP is coming from, but if that dog already is having a hard life and if he WFH and is able to change dog diapers I think he should until the GF gets on board/seeks a vet opinion. Otherwise the dog will likely develop UTIs. The GF is probably just in denial and it is a hard thing to hear. However, if she is able to keep on top of care and the dog does have a good quality of life outside of incontinence, she can choose to keep going.\n\nEdit: I rescind the comment about the good quality of life.

I had a beagle growing up, precious girl. She loved to run rabbits, squirrels, etc all over.

As soon as his bladder went we called the vet to book euthanasia. It was so distressed by losing his bodily functions. It was a hard call to make but we had to do it. I just wish he could\u2019ve lived long enough to meet our baby when he was born but we couldn\u2019t just leave him in that state.

Instead, we gave him one last day, took him on a hike (we had just bought a special backpack for him so we could carry him when he got tired), fed him his favourite snacks and food, and cuddled with him.

I'm still going to say soft NAH here because it's still not his decision to make, even though I do believe it is the correct one. The care of the dog shouldn't be given up yet until the end. I think OP should still keep pushing to get her to change her mind. It's obviously not an easy situation. Maybe these comments will help them.\n\nEdit: Def leaning more gf TA now though", "Had to put our elderly 18 year old cat to sleep a few years ago. The last time she managed to get into my bed to sleep with me (I had steps leading up to make it easier for her) she shat herself and didn't move to clean herself or anything. That was definitely the end of the end. She wasn't eating or drinking much the next day or two either so it was clear we couldn't draw it out any longer. \n\nSo, I do think it OP's gf has to have the dog wear diapers and hand feed/water it then it might be time to let go. I think my cat's decline may have happened over a shorter period of time but as pet owners we definitely have a responsibility not to let them suffer.", "I had to have my 17-year-old dog I'd had since I was 15 or 16 put down, a good 10 years ago. I also had to let a ferret go last year. I'll miss them forever, but letting them go on with zero quality of life would've been the worse option. \n\nMy dog now, she's about 11, and she's probably not much longer for this world. She still gets excited for walkies but then has trouble getting to the top of our driveway and is clearly in pain after a few minutes (panting, limping on her hind legs... she balances on only her forelegs to pee so she doesn't have to put weight on the back legs squatting). She's also not eating properly and is losing weight. \n\nI dont know if the vet can give her anything to make it better, but we may be facing some tough decisions next week at her annual.", "You are exaggerating what was said in the original post.", ">do you like pineapple on pizza and your partner doesn't?\n\nYeah because pizza toppings and prolonging the existence of a suffering animal is the exact same thing", "If the dog is getting infections/has dementia etc then yeah, I agree. But these things aren't necessarily the case at all. They should take it to a vet for a check up, not have a bunch of redditors give input without even seeing it.\n\nFwiw I have had several dogs put down as soon as their health has started to deteriorate. I'm just amazed at how quick people are to make remote diagnoses of a dog they've not even seen.", "I\u2019ve been in her shoes for 5 dogs, 2 cats, a kitten, 7-8 birds, a ferret. If any of my pets had reached the stage where they literally could not live without being hand fed and watered at an extreme age then I\u2019d make the choice to see a vet, address their quality of life, and put an end to the very obvious suffering, as is my duty as a pet owner. If the vets stated that they\u2019re not suffering and have a decent QoL then I\u2019d continue to care and love them. But there\u2019s slim to no chance a vet would condone keeping this dog alive.", "No what she's doing to the dog is cruel. If you keep your dogs alive long enough that they can't control themselves then you suck. It's the most heartbreaking thing to see them in that much pain.  I hope you don't have kids if that's the way you treat animals.", "I just can\u2019t see why that\u2019d be funny to anyone over the age of 12. It\u2019s more sad than funny.", "My parents dog had something similar. Playing, eating, happy as a clam, till she suddenly wasn't. She had masses all over her insides and my parents had no clue till she just collapsed one day.   \n\n\nIt was extra sad because they had just put down their other dog two weeks earlier. He had been deteriorating for ages and should have been let go months before,  so it wasn't so much of a shock for them, but the losing the other dog unexpectedly two weeks later was so hard. They're still really broken up about it.", "\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude22 my heart. Thank you for loving her.", "These stories are breaking my heart, I\u2019m so sorry for you all. My little boy Monty is only 2, I\u2019ll make sure I give him an extra big cuddle and cherish every moment. I know one day this terrible decision will have to be made and I\u2019d never prolong his suffering. NTA.

It was heartbreaking as well but I am atleast glad he didn't suffer", "Took my Squig in because she had some sort of infection going on.\n\nVet picked her up, and said \"Uh, I'm feeling lumps around her nipples, I think we need to do an x-ray\".\n\nCame back, she had a mass between her heart and windpipe, that was going to kill her within months.  Zero clue.\n\nPut her down a couple hours later.  8 years ago today.  Not what you want to deal with the day before your birthday.", "It is obviously an exaggeration...\n\nEither way, I don't think this alone would be a big reason to break up. Yes, the pet is suffering but so is she. She might realize his quality of life is bad but it's hard for her to let go as she cares for him deeply. These choices are hard to make so others should be understanding and patient when explaining what would benefit the dog.", "It\u2019s an exaggeration, but people do jump to breaking up very quickly on this site. \n\nYou\u2019re not always going to agree with your partner and there will be arguments. That\u2019s just a relationship. She is going through a lot of emotions right now, and that\u2019s understandable. \n\nTbh, both OP and the girlfriend could have handle this situation better. I don\u2019t see any reason to break up over this.", "I think people are seeing enough evidence that it is wildly unlikely that the dog isn't constantly suffering given its condition. I haven't ever seen a dog as old and debilitated as this one is described that wasn't just waiting to die. \n\nIt does need to be seen by a vet, but OP's girlfriend's attitude is selfish and irresponsible. It doesn't take a medical professional to see that.", "Have you considered they don\u2019t want to be put down either?", "I like how you ignore the giant list of problems that this dog is having and only chalk it up to \"hand feeding him sometimes\".", "tf is sad about the title?", "My mom was in declining health for a number of years. Six years on dialysis kept her around to see the last of her grandbabies to be born. But towards the end of her life, she caught COVID. It simply took everything out of her.\n\nI remember going into her room to check on her with my brother. We were talking and I took her hand. I told her that we would be okay. I had found a job and my brother was still working.\n\nThe next day, I walked into her room to check on her. She was wearing jeans. When I asked her where she was going, she told me not to worry.\n\nThe next day, she was gone.\n\nLife is painfully short at times. We all have to deal with death in some fashion before our time.

Of course. No one wants to put down anyone for their own enjoyment? Tf kind of question is that lol", "A dog in a diaper is sad because it means the dog can\u2019t control it\u2019s bowls and/or bladder.

Vets typically treat these situations very delicately broaching the idea without overtly making a recommendation. \n\nIt isn't internet strangers making the assessment. It is the person who stays home with the dog every day making the evaluation. An animal owner shouldn't need a vet to recognize that their 18 year old dog has lost all of its faculties and the quality of life that it once had.", "Not necessarily. There are still strange ppl out there who put diapers on animals just because.

I don't think I need a psychologist, but maybe someday. this topic may make me seem less put together than I am.", "Okay?", "Vets have made assessments before when it comes to flipped stomachs, organ failure and the dogs age.", "Since we\u2019re talking about animals, animals cannot tell us when they\u2019re in pain or where, they also cannot make decisions for themselves like humans can. We as their humans *have* to advocate for them with the help of the animals veterinarian. \n\nAlso, an animal refusing food and having to be hand fed is typically a sign that the animal should see a vet, because something could be going on internally."]}
