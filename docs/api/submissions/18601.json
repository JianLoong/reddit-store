Left to his own devices, he would have long ago found himself a quiet spot and crossed the rainbow bridge. I have seen supposed animal lovers do this to their animals many times. We owe them more than this. She needs to end his suffering already. He can't drink, eat, control his bodily functions, see, or hear. She's being quite awful.", "NTA. It sounds like the dog doesn\u2019t have much of a life at this stage if he is deaf almost blind and can\u2019t smell and has no control over its bodily functions. \n\nWhat does the dogs vet recommend? I think this might help your case if they agree with you.", "NTA. I'm pretty much a misanthropic hermit who only hangs out with animals and doesn't eat meat, and I'd let that poor old guy sleep at this stage, too. It absolutely is selfish of your SO to keep him suffering such a poor QoL, and I am sure you're right that she's doing it for herself, not for him. You're NTA. Stand your ground. Consider your position, too. Do you really want to be with someone who'll allow someone she claims to love to suffer for years just for the sake of her own comfort? I wouldn't.", "NTA.

Poor dog. Sounds like he needs to be put out of his misery and allowed to cross the rainbow bridge", "As someone who had to put down a childhood dog within the last year, I get it. I understand how hard that decision is to make, it literally destroys you. My family hoped that our pup would pass peacefully in the night but she was one stubborn dog and just wouldn\u2019t let go. Her mind appeared to be completely there but her body just did not work anymore. \n\nI don\u2019t know how you worded it, but I would bring up the subject again as tactfully as you can. It\u2019s so hard. You have to show her you\u2019re empathetic, tell her you understand, but remind her that this dog is not living how a dog is meant to live anymore. Don\u2019t blackmail her into making the hardest choice she will ever have to make, she will resent never forgive you for that.

Rather he expire while one of you is sleeping or away from home.", "NAH. This is a hard situation. I'm curious what the dog's vet says about this. Do they feel the dog still has a good-enough quality of life? If the vet recommends putting him to rest, I would be more on your side. I wonder if she just cannot let him go.

Otherwise that's just cruel. I'd be changing the diaper EVERY time he went ffs. I don't think she understands how much this poor ol guy deserves rest.\n\nI take my senior cat in to the vet monthly. I've bluntly told him (and freaked him out with it) that when it's time, it's time. He feels like if the cat has a chance to get better we gotta give him that. I mean he's generally right but man...

You truly seem like you want him dead to reduce your own inconvieniece. Fuck your carpets. If you actually care about your partner, help her care for the dog. I'm not surprised she exploded.

You come across as an undesirable partner.", "NTA", "NTA", "YTA dogwise, but NTA girlfriendwise. \n\nIt's not the dogs fault the situation is what it is. Also.. even the diapers are an infection risk, not to mention not changing and cleaning.\n\nBut you are absolutely right, loving human thing would be to let the dog go.", "YTA. Is he enjoying food and company still? Is he free of unmanageable pain? Are you capable of caring for him collectively? If so, you\u2019d be putting him down out of sheer convenience to yourself, not for him in any way. \n\nI sure hope you don\u2019t lose any function as you age, sheesh.

YTA. The fact you argued that she needed to kill her dog and threw the lease in her face is pretty fucked up. I assume you two decided to move in together so why make it seem like it's just your place? You're making her a guest in her own home. \n\nThe fact that you argue the dog is suffering which is why you want to put the dog down and then go on to mention you won't help out with the dog shows you didn't want to help in the first place. If you really cared about the dog suffering you'd want to reduce that suffering until it died instead of ignoring it. That really shows that you don't want to take care of the dog and suffering has nothing to do with it.", "NAH", "NTA. At some point, we do have to let our beloved animals go. It is absolutely hard. But his quality of life isn\u2019t great either.", "She is testing your commitment level. Do as you please but if you care for her. Care for the dog or both are gone.", "ESH - your girlfriend is putting her feelings above the health of her dog and she needs to come to terms with the fact that her dog has reached his end of life. This can be really heartbreaking and difficult. I've seen this happen with my own family and it's really hard to see an animal suffering when a person just isn't ready to let go. It needs to be approached with caution and  sensitivity and you should encourage her maybe to have a real conversation with her vet about his quality of life.  But it seems like you care more about your apartment then the actual suffering of the dog which makes you an asshole.", "NTA time for her beagle to sleep.\n\nIf you have a spare 50k you could get viagen to clone her beagle.", "You're selfish... you don't want to clean up after someone else's pet. That's not cruel, that's simply being human.\n\nI think you're projecting your dislike of cleaning up after the dog to the dog itself. If he can wag his tail and wiggle into his owner's arms, then he is unlikely to be suffering. When my dog was suffering and I had to have her euthanized, she didn't wag her tail or wiggle in my arms even though she knew it was me holding her.\n\nTell her that you genuinely believe it would be better for him BUT he is her dog, not yours. However, you will not be doing these things for her. Possible suggest crating him until she is home since he doesn't really move around much but insist on a pet deposit from her to cover whatever your landlord will want due to the damage. \\[Crating is not cruel.\\]\n\nEquivalent judgement - either both or neither of you are A H.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His life has just turned into a nightmare.", "I plan to be dead by 70.\n\nBut yeah, If I was in the state the dog is in id want to be put down", "I work in a nursing home and have literally seen many elderly beg to be let go. One case: a woman with two fake hips, a fake knee, multiple spine surgeries, etc. Her sons refused to let her leave and she spent the last years of her life being forced to live, all the while she was begging to be allowed to die with dignity. When we finally convinced her sons to sign the release for palliative care (comfort measures only, no more curative treatment), she fell asleep and stayed that way until she passed five days later. Another: a man with severely advanced Parkinson's. His wife refused to let him have strong pain killers or to put him in a proper care facility where he could be looked after 24/7 by trained professionals, but was too old to care for him herself. He had an open, necrotized pressure ulcer that was so deep you could see his spine, and three more just about to open. She forced him to hold on and live even though he only got changed and turned twice a day when caretakers came to his house (they had plenty of money for proper care btw). He passed a few days ago and all his caretakers and kids acknowledge that he was ready and his wife had forced him to go on for too long. He no longer feels pain and doesnt have to suffer the indignity of some nurses gagging at the smell coming from his wound.\n\n It is hard to let the ones we love go, and although your grandma was fine with it, many elderly in conditions like this dog would prefer to go than be at the mercy of caretakers and have their dignity taken from them. Even if the caregivers are the sweetest and their actions are only done with the gentlest touch, it is humiliating to live in such circumstances. \n\nAs a second note, I had a very old dog I let go in September. She has Cushings (her tumor was on the pituitary gland) and had begun stroking. After what I assume was stroke number three, I let her go. I would have done it after the first but didnt recognize what was happening. Had a final day full of cuddles, ice cream, and lazing by the river where the grass smelled strong. It nearly killed me to let her go, and I still cry about it when I let myself think of her final days, but I made the right choice. That is no way for a dog to live. \n\nFinally, I do agree that the bf should help with the dog, as it isn't fair to leave him sitting in filth all day. But he should only do the bare minimum (diapers and water) and leave the rest to his gf to do before and after work. The dog doesn't need to be walked every few hours anyway, and eating twice a day is reasonable.

You can die when you want, but the dog can't tell you when it's ready to go. I'm sorry that you're guaranteed to get dementia, honestly, that really sucks. Cards don't look too good for me healthy wise either, but I'm not going to advocate for legalized killing or killing pets or anything/anyone else though wanting to die due to your reasons are a bit different.", "That is suffering. It has no quality of life. It no longer engages the world as a dog does. It is an 18 year old beagle. It's past time.

I have watched 1 grandparent, 1 great grandparent and am in the process of watching another grandparent die. I will tell you if I ever get diagnosed with dementia I will be fighting for my right to die with dignity, if I get terminal cancer, same thing. I already have rheumatoid arthritis at 26 and dont know what the future will hold for me. At this stage life us worth living but im not going to continue on if it gets tot he point where i am in extreme pain every single day. There is a point where living is just not worthwhile anymore. For this dog, the blindness, deafness and inability to smell are less of a concern but the inability to eat/ drink and incontinence is a very good indicator something is majorly wrong, the point where a dog stops eating and drinking on its own is a very clear point where QOL has severely declined and euthanasia is on the table, same for any animal really, it really is the animals way of saying it is time. I know when any of my rats get to that point, it will be straight to the vet, I will not let them suffer which is inevitably what the gf is doing. You may think the dog can't say but for all those GI issues to be present, there is something majorly wrong (cancer, severe pain etc.). Nobody is advocating for people to put the dog down as soon as it became an inconvenience but c'mon, objectively looking at the issues and why they might be present shows this dog is suffering majorly", "Im starting to knock on a bit, when i was younger i used to think it was all about numbers and wanted to get to a very old age.\n\nI realise now that it is not a number game, its just about quality.\n\nI will not live through dementia, i will not live stuck in  a room. \n\nNot only for myself but i really dont want to give my family the trauma of dealing with it/me in those instances.", "The dog is deaf, going blind, can\u2019t eat or use the bathroom without assistance, and has no sense of smell.

Life isn't defined by those things and I see why life wouldn't be as good as it used to but don't get why that means you should want to die.

I already can't see very well at 20 and I think I have tinnitus. Smelling things is nice, but I'm not sure how much I'd miss it compared to seeing and hearing. Obviously, I'd rather not eat through a tube or use diapers, but would I be willing to live with all that yes? It's called not wanting to die. The only way I can see myself wanting to die is If I'm completely bedridden with all those things.

YTA.", "ESH- You're right, but I think you're further separating yourself from her emotionally at a time when she's going to need you with the way you're going about it and that might cause a rift as the dog passes. She needs to get the dog's QoL evaluated- but she's not going to be willing to accept that if she's in this stage of her grieving still and I think treating it how you are is pushing her more into that state.", "ESH - This is so sad. I had to put my dog down a couple of years back and I was absolutely devastated. I suggest booking a consult with a vet to get a professional opinion. I can see both your points, but we don't think rationally with our loved ones.", "YTA and so are people validating your disgusting opinion.\n\nA dog is not a convenience. If someone -like your girlfriend- sees their dog as family then apply your opinion to an elderly relative and see how it sounds. Its gross. It is an appropriate comparison because let's are a part of the family. Thats why she is mad, because thats what you are ignoring. It is her family- a part of her- and you are tired of caring for it and want to end it for your own sake. You care more about carpet than a significant part of who she is- a girl who loves her dog. \n\nIt is appalling to read peoples delusional justification for killing a pet as 'good for the pet'. It isnt. The dog isnt suffering- its old. Your girlfriend is not *forcing it to suffer* in any way. She dealing with the reality of caring for an elderly pet. You frame the situation as absurd but it isnt. She is doing everything right. She isnt keeping it alive for her own selfishness, shes putting in effort to manage its needs. That dog sounds like hes still getting on- hes eating and going out and ***living*** out the end of his life. You didn't say anything about the dog being in pain. Its not on an IV or respirator- this is not withdrawing medical intervention to allow a natural death- its euthanasia. The dog isnt struggling, you are. You need to admit to yourself (because she knows) that you dont want to provide adequate care \"changing diapers\" and want to euthanize it so you dont have to be in the situation. \n\nThe implication this thread has for disability is abhorent and unethical. Is incontinence a reason to end life?  Blindness?  Which age-related disabilities are too inconvenient to tolerate? \n\nMost important issue here- its her dog and she made the (right) choice and you are trying to push her into something she doesn't believe in or want to do, and you dont care about the emotional impact it will have on her. You would rather let the dog suffer in shit while you watch, so that she knows its being neglected while shes at work, so she'll be forced to do what you want. You want to make her feel guilty when she isnt at fault, like many of the responses here. That is what makes YTA- You are heartless.\n\nI really hope your girlfriend sees what was important to you during this time in her life and dumps you for having so little respect for her. If you dont want that you'll figure out a way to see it from her perspective and show you care about her by caring about the dog. Youll do it without making her feel guilty or gaslight her that shes being cruel to the pet she obviously loves deeply.\n\nMy partner was with me, for everything, caring for my 18 year old dog in his final years. My partner helped me carry the dog in a baby sling on walks. He helped me clean every accidental mess and he bought a carpet cleaner so we could prevent the loss of our rental deposit. He agreed when I wanted to quit working so I could spend as much time as possible at home with my dog. My partner even slept on the floor next to me when the dog was in his final weeks and it wasn't safe for him to be on the bed. Never once did he suggest what you did, because he listened to me and actually empathized with me. He respected me and gave nothing but support. Your girlfriend deserves a partner like that.", "YTA, big one. This is not your place to tell her to end the life of her best friend of 18 years. You want to kill her dog so you aren't put out. It's pretty disgusting", "YTA - What\u2019s his quality of life outside of being an inconvenience to you?   What\u2019s his habit?  Does he wag his tail?  Cuddle with your girlfriend?  \n\nIf he has problems smelling, he probably doesn\u2019t know what is safe to consume and is trusting your girlfriend to help him out.", "Hahahaha haven\u2019t read it yet, but the title alone made me have to hold in the biggest laughter as I pictured a puppy with a diaper on \ud83d\ude2d", "Yes, YTA.
