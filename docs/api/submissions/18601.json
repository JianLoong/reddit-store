That\u2019s what we did before deciding to let our elderly cat go.", "NTA. She is being cruel. This dog is no longer living as a dog. Left to his own devices, he would have long ago found himself a quiet spot and crossed the rainbow bridge. I have seen supposed animal lovers do this to their animals many times. We owe them more than this. She needs to end his suffering already. He can't drink, eat, control his bodily functions, see, or hear. She's being quite awful.", "NTA. It sounds like the dog doesn\u2019t have much of a life at this stage if he is deaf almost blind and can\u2019t smell and has no control over its bodily functions. \n\nWhat does the dogs vet recommend? I think this might help your case if they agree with you.", "NTA. I'm pretty much a misanthropic hermit who only hangs out with animals and doesn't eat meat, and I'd let that poor old guy sleep at this stage, too. It absolutely is selfish of your SO to keep him suffering such a poor QoL, and I am sure you're right that she's doing it for herself, not for him. You're NTA. Stand your ground. Consider your position, too. Do you really want to be with someone who'll allow someone she claims to love to suffer for years just for the sake of her own comfort? I wouldn't.", "NTA.

Poor dog. Sounds like he needs to be put out of his misery and allowed to cross the rainbow bridge", "As someone who had to put down a childhood dog within the last year, I get it. I understand how hard that decision is to make, it literally destroys you. My family hoped that our pup would pass peacefully in the night but she was one stubborn dog and just wouldn\u2019t let go. Her mind appeared to be completely there but her body just did not work anymore. \n\nI don\u2019t know how you worded it, but I would bring up the subject again as tactfully as you can. It\u2019s so hard. You have to show her you\u2019re empathetic, tell her you understand, but remind her that this dog is not living how a dog is meant to live anymore. Don\u2019t blackmail her into making the hardest choice she will ever have to make, she will resent never forgive you for that.

Rather he expire while one of you is sleeping or away from home.", "NAH. This is a hard situation. I'm curious what the dog's vet says about this. Do they feel the dog still has a good-enough quality of life? If the vet recommends putting him to rest, I would be more on your side. I wonder if she just cannot let him go.

Otherwise that's just cruel. I'd be changing the diaper EVERY time he went ffs. I don't think she understands how much this poor ol guy deserves rest.\n\nI take my senior cat in to the vet monthly. I've bluntly told him (and freaked him out with it) that when it's time, it's time. He feels like if the cat has a chance to get better we gotta give him that. I mean he's generally right but man...

You truly seem like you want him dead to reduce your own inconvieniece. Fuck your carpets. If you actually care about your partner, help her care for the dog. I'm not surprised she exploded.

You come across as an undesirable partner.", "NTA", "NTA", "YTA dogwise, but NTA girlfriendwise. \n\nIt's not the dogs fault the situation is what it is. Also.. even the diapers are an infection risk, not to mention not changing and cleaning.\n\nBut you are absolutely right, loving human thing would be to let the dog go.", "YTA. Is he enjoying food and company still? Is he free of unmanageable pain? Are you capable of caring for him collectively? If so, you\u2019d be putting him down out of sheer convenience to yourself, not for him in any way. \n\nI sure hope you don\u2019t lose any function as you age, sheesh. You sound remarkably selfish and like you\u2019re one of those young people who think that they\u2019re immortal and that anyone (or anything) that ages does so through moral flaws.", "yath. you asked your partner to euthanize her dog. it\u2019s one thing if the dog is suffering but the thing is that animals get old and sometimes need help. if the vets says he should keep living then you trust the vet. i understand that this isn\u2019t your dog but dating someone, living with that person is supposed to be a partnership. if this inconvenience is too much for you then it seems like this relationship is not a partnership you can commit to. the issue at hand isn\u2019t about your partner and her dog-parenting skills, the issue is whether or not you decide to support her with a creature she clearly cares deeply about.", "Do you want her to kill you when you're old and need to wear diapers? YTA. The fact you argued that she needed to kill her dog and threw the lease in her face is pretty fucked up. I assume you two decided to move in together so why make it seem like it's just your place? You're making her a guest in her own home. \n\nThe fact that you argue the dog is suffering which is why you want to put the dog down and then go on to mention you won't help out with the dog shows you didn't want to help in the first place. If you really cared about the dog suffering you'd want to reduce that suffering until it died instead of ignoring it. That really shows that you don't want to take care of the dog and suffering has nothing to do with it.", "NAH", "NTA. At some point, we do have to let our beloved animals go. It is absolutely hard. But his quality of life isn\u2019t great either.", "She is testing your commitment level. Do as you please but if you care for her. Care for the dog or both are gone.", "ESH - your girlfriend is putting her feelings above the health of her dog and she needs to come to terms with the fact that her dog has reached his end of life. This can be really heartbreaking and difficult. I've seen this happen with my own family and it's really hard to see an animal suffering when a person just isn't ready to let go. It needs to be approached with caution and  sensitivity and you should encourage her maybe to have a real conversation with her vet about his quality of life.  But it seems like you care more about your apartment then the actual suffering of the dog which makes you an asshole.", "NTA time for her beagle to sleep.\n\nIf you have a spare 50k you could get viagen to clone her beagle.", "You're selfish... you don't want to clean up after someone else's pet. That's not cruel, that's simply being human.\n\nI think you're projecting your dislike of cleaning up after the dog to the dog itself. If he can wag his tail and wiggle into his owner's arms, then he is unlikely to be suffering. When my dog was suffering and I had to have her euthanized, she didn't wag her tail or wiggle in my arms even though she knew it was me holding her.\n\nTell her that you genuinely believe it would be better for him BUT he is her dog, not yours. However, you will not be doing these things for her. Possible suggest crating him until she is home since he doesn't really move around much but insist on a pet deposit from her to cover whatever your landlord will want due to the damage. \\[Crating is not cruel.\\]\n\nEquivalent judgement - either both or neither of you are A H.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His life has just turned into a nightmare.", "I plan to be dead by 70.\n\nBut yeah, If I was in the state the dog is in id want to be put down", "I work in a nursing home and have literally seen many elderly beg to be let go. One case: a woman with two fake hips, a fake knee, multiple spine surgeries, etc. Her sons refused to let her leave and she spent the last years of her life being forced to live, all the while she was begging to be allowed to die with dignity. When we finally convinced her sons to sign the release for palliative care (comfort measures only, no more curative treatment), she fell asleep and stayed that way until she passed five days later. Another: a man with severely advanced Parkinson's. His wife refused to let him have strong pain killers or to put him in a proper care facility where he could be looked after 24/7 by trained professionals, but was too old to care for him herself. He had an open, necrotized pressure ulcer that was so deep you could see his spine, and three more just about to open. She forced him to hold on and live even though he only got changed and turned twice a day when caretakers came to his house (they had plenty of money for proper care btw). He passed a few days ago and all his caretakers and kids acknowledge that he was ready and his wife had forced him to go on for too long. He no longer feels pain and doesnt have to suffer the indignity of some nurses gagging at the smell coming from his wound.\n\n It is hard to let the ones we love go, and although your grandma was fine with it, many elderly in conditions like this dog would prefer to go than be at the mercy of caretakers and have their dignity taken from them. Even if the caregivers are the sweetest and their actions are only done with the gentlest touch, it is humiliating to live in such circumstances. \n\nAs a second note, I had a very old dog I let go in September. She has Cushings (her tumor was on the pituitary gland) and had begun stroking. After what I assume was stroke number three, I let her go. I would have done it after the first but didnt recognize what was happening. Had a final day full of cuddles, ice cream, and lazing by the river where the grass smelled strong. It nearly killed me to let her go, and I still cry about it when I let myself think of her final days, but I made the right choice. That is no way for a dog to live. \n\nFinally, I do agree that the bf should help with the dog, as it isn't fair to leave him sitting in filth all day. But he should only do the bare minimum (diapers and water) and leave the rest to his gf to do before and after work. The dog doesn't need to be walked every few hours anyway, and eating twice a day is reasonable.

You can die when you want, but the dog can't tell you when it's ready to go. I'm sorry that you're guaranteed to get dementia, honestly, that really sucks. Cards don't look too good for me healthy wise either, but I'm not going to advocate for legalized killing or killing pets or anything/anyone else though wanting to die due to your reasons are a bit different.", "That is suffering. It has no quality of life. It no longer engages the world as a dog does. It is an 18 year old beagle. It's past time. Selfish delusional animal owners will always find a sign that their dog is fine.", "It can't find the water bowl of the food dish. It struggles to perceive the world. There are no thrills here.", "I think maybe you haven't seen any of these issues first hand and it sounds like you are quite young hence the concept that death is not necessarily the worst thing might not be familiar to you. I have watched 1 grandparent, 1 great grandparent and am in the process of watching another grandparent die. I will tell you if I ever get diagnosed with dementia I will be fighting for my right to die with dignity, if I get terminal cancer, same thing. I already have rheumatoid arthritis at 26 and dont know what the future will hold for me. At this stage life us worth living but im not going to continue on if it gets tot he point where i am in extreme pain every single day. There is a point where living is just not worthwhile anymore. For this dog, the blindness, deafness and inability to smell are less of a concern but the inability to eat/ drink and incontinence is a very good indicator something is majorly wrong, the point where a dog stops eating and drinking on its own is a very clear point where QOL has severely declined and euthanasia is on the table, same for any animal really, it really is the animals way of saying it is time. I know when any of my rats get to that point, it will be straight to the vet, I will not let them suffer which is inevitably what the gf is doing. You may think the dog can't say but for all those GI issues to be present, there is something majorly wrong (cancer, severe pain etc.). Nobody is advocating for people to put the dog down as soon as it became an inconvenience but c'mon, objectively looking at the issues and why they might be present shows this dog is suffering majorly", "Im starting to knock on a bit, when i was younger i used to think it was all about numbers and wanted to get to a very old age.\n\nI realise now that it is not a number game, its just about quality.\n\nI will not live through dementia, i will not live stuck in  a room. \n\nNot only for myself but i really dont want to give my family the trauma of dealing with it/me in those instances.", "The dog is deaf, going blind, can\u2019t eat or use the bathroom without assistance, and has no sense of smell. The dog is *eighteen* \n\nIf you as a human we\u2019re experiencing all of this, plus other health issues, what would you want? Would you want family to keep you alive for their sake or let you go for yours? \n\nNTA", "As someone who has sadly needed to make the decision to put nearly a dozen pets to sleep (and one died in her sleep after 22 years), in my experience, they let you know pretty clearly when they\u2019re done. It\u2019s not always based on mobility or senses, especially when they\u2019re very old and have gradually added those limitations and adapted to them. \n\nOP is not an AH for suggesting it might be time. He is an AH for demanding it happen when the owner doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s time yet.", "because the dog has difficulty eating? I'm sure the dog still like belly rubs and resting with the owner. Not sure how often the dog plays but maybe it still does. Even if the dog doesn't maybe it's a lazy dog and likes lounging. You can't say the dog isn't enjoying the little bit of life it has.", "I probably would want to live. Life isn't defined by those things and I see why life wouldn't be as good as it used to but don't get why that means you should want to die. All people are describing is being old and I won't throw myself away when I'm old nor will I throw away animals.", "Owners can't always be trusted to make the right decision for their animals. I've had to make this decision with my beloved creatures. I've also witnessed friends, family, and neighbors needlessly torture their animals. This guy lives with this animal all day everyday. The dog has to be hydrated by bottle all of the time and hand fed much of the time. That isn't adaptation.", "It\u2019s not just difficulty eating it\u2019s eating, drinking, smelling, seeing, hearing, using the bathroom.", "You\u2019d really want to live your life not being able to see or hear your loved ones ever again and having to heavily rely on others, you\u2019d really want to live life without ever smelling food or the things around you while also not being able to taste much as well since the two go hand in hand, you\u2019d also be willing to spend the rest of your life in diapers possibly contacting infections? \n\nNot to mention you\u2019d have to have a feeding tube and an IV inserted to get nutrients back into your body.", "I know no one will respect my opinion, but I'm pretty sure I'll be deaf and blind when I'm old. I already can't see very well at 20 and I think I have tinnitus. Smelling things is nice, but I'm not sure how much I'd miss it compared to seeing and hearing. Obviously, I'd rather not eat through a tube or use diapers, but would I be willing to live with all that yes? It's called not wanting to die. The only way I can see myself wanting to die is If I'm completely bedridden with all those things. Like I can't enjoy anything about my day because I'm just in bed or maybe in a coma that I'm not coming out of. If my body is just not at its peak then yes I want to still live.", "This dogs body isn\u2019t at its peak, it\u2019s far beyond it and I\u2019m going to be honest, she\u2019s not taking care of him as well as she should be if she wants to keep him alive. \n\nShe needs to take him to a veterinarian to get their *professional* opinion, especially since he\u2019s so old. Beagles lifespan are the same as most dogs, 15 years is pretty old, but *eighteen* is borderline ancient for him. How does she know he\u2019s not having any internal issues going on why he isn\u2019t eating or drinking as he should be? For all she knows he could have a flipped stomach, organ failure or other ailments that are causing him not to eat or drink. \n\nThere\u2019s a LOT of things OPs girlfriend NEEDS to get checked rather than figuring things out on her own.", "Of course not, your opinion is ridiculous.", "My opinion on whether or not I'd want to live or die is ridiculous? That paragraph wasn't even about the dog, it was about what I'd want for my life."]}
