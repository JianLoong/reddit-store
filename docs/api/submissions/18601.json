Left to his own devices, he would have long ago found himself a quiet spot and crossed the rainbow bridge. I have seen supposed animal lovers do this to their animals many times.

I think this might help your case if they agree with you.", "NTA. I'm pretty much a misanthropic hermit who only hangs out with animals and doesn't eat meat, and I'd let that poor old guy sleep at this stage, too. It absolutely is selfish of your SO to keep him suffering such a poor QoL, and I am sure you're right that she's doing it for herself, not for him. You're NTA. Stand your ground.

I understand how hard that decision is to make, it literally destroys you. My family hoped that our pup would pass peacefully in the night but she was one stubborn dog and just wouldn\u2019t let go. Her mind appeared to be completely there but her body just did not work anymore. Made the decision all the more difficult but her quality of life just wasn\u2019t worth continuing. \n\nI don\u2019t know how you worded it, but I would bring up the subject again as tactfully as you can. It\u2019s so hard. You have to show her you\u2019re empathetic, tell her you understand, but remind her that this dog is not living how a dog is meant to live anymore.

Rather he expire while one of you is sleeping or away from home.", "NAH. This is a hard situation. I'm curious what the dog's vet says about this. Do they feel the dog still has a good-enough quality of life? If the vet recommends putting him to rest, I would be more on your side. I wonder if she just cannot let him go.

You truly seem like you want him dead to reduce your own inconvieniece. Fuck your carpets. If you actually care about your partner, help her care for the dog or approach the conversation from a place of compassion. I'm not surprised she exploded. What's your plan? If shes not home and you are, are you just going to leave this elderly dog in his own soil? That's sick. You come across as an undesirable partner.\n\nIf this was my dog I would let go for the dogs best interest after having a quality of life assessment done with the vet and a discussion of whether we can improve his life. All the reasons OP listed to want to euthanize were self centered.", "NTA", "NTA", "YTA dogwise, but NTA girlfriendwise. \n\nIt's not the dogs fault the situation is what it is. Also.. even the diapers are an infection risk, not to mention not changing and cleaning.\n\nBut you are absolutely right, loving human thing would be to let the dog go.", "YTA. Is he enjoying food and company still? Is he free of unmanageable pain? Are you capable of caring for him collectively? If so, you\u2019d be putting him down out of sheer convenience to yourself, not for him in any way. \n\nI sure hope you don\u2019t lose any function as you age, sheesh.

YTA. The fact you argued that she needed to kill her dog and threw the lease in her face is pretty fucked up. I assume you two decided to move in together so why make it seem like it's just your place? You're making her a guest in her own home. \n\nThe fact that you argue the dog is suffering which is why you want to put the dog down and then go on to mention you won't help out with the dog shows you didn't want to help in the first place. If you really cared about the dog suffering you'd want to reduce that suffering until it died instead of ignoring it. That really shows that you don't want to take care of the dog and suffering has nothing to do with it.", "NAH", "NTA. At some point, we do have to let our beloved animals go. It is absolutely hard.

This can be really heartbreaking and difficult. I've seen this happen with my own family and it's really hard to see an animal suffering when a person just isn't ready to let go. It needs to be approached with caution and  sensitivity and you should encourage her maybe to have a real conversation with her vet about his quality of life.  But it seems like you care more about your apartment then the actual suffering of the dog which makes you an asshole.", "NTA time for her beagle to sleep.\n\nIf you have a spare 50k you could get viagen to clone her beagle.", "You're selfish... you don't want to clean up after someone else's pet. That's not cruel, that's simply being human.\n\nI think you're projecting your dislike of cleaning up after the dog to the dog itself. If he can wag his tail and wiggle into his owner's arms, then he is unlikely to be suffering. When my dog was suffering and I had to have her euthanized, she didn't wag her tail or wiggle in my arms even though she knew it was me holding her.\n\nTell her that you genuinely believe it would be better for him BUT he is her dog, not yours. However, you will not be doing these things for her. Possible suggest crating him until she is home since he doesn't really move around much but insist on a pet deposit from her to cover whatever your landlord will want due to the damage. \\[Crating is not cruel.\\]\n\nEquivalent judgement - either both or neither of you are A H.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One case: a woman with two fake hips, a fake knee, multiple spine surgeries, etc. Her sons refused to let her leave and she spent the last years of her life being forced to live, all the while she was begging to be allowed to die with dignity. When we finally convinced her sons to sign the release for palliative care (comfort measures only, no more curative treatment), she fell asleep and stayed that way until she passed five days later. Another: a man with severely advanced Parkinson's. His wife refused to let him have strong pain killers or to put him in a proper care facility where he could be looked after 24/7 by trained professionals, but was too old to care for him herself. He had an open, necrotized pressure ulcer that was so deep you could see his spine, and three more just about to open. She forced him to hold on and live even though he only got changed and turned twice a day when caretakers came to his house (they had plenty of money for proper care btw). He passed a few days ago and all his caretakers and kids acknowledge that he was ready and his wife had forced him to go on for too long. He no longer feels pain and doesnt have to suffer the indignity of some nurses gagging at the smell coming from his wound.\n\n It is hard to let the ones we love go, and although your grandma was fine with it, many elderly in conditions like this dog would prefer to go than be at the mercy of caretakers and have their dignity taken from them. Even if the caregivers are the sweetest and their actions are only done with the gentlest touch, it is humiliating to live in such circumstances. \n\nAs a second note, I had a very old dog I let go in September. She has Cushings (her tumor was on the pituitary gland) and had begun stroking. After what I assume was stroke number three, I let her go. I would have done it after the first but didnt recognize what was happening. Had a final day full of cuddles, ice cream, and lazing by the river where the grass smelled strong. It nearly killed me to let her go, and I still cry about it when I let myself think of her final days, but I made the right choice. That is no way for a dog to live. \n\nFinally, I do agree that the bf should help with the dog, as it isn't fair to leave him sitting in filth all day. But he should only do the bare minimum (diapers and water) and leave the rest to his gf to do before and after work. The dog doesn't need to be walked every few hours anyway, and eating twice a day is reasonable.

One of my grandparents died before I was born, one of my grandmothers died the day after I turned 16 (messed me up actually), her mother died about eight months after her (she had dementia), and my other grandmother died about two months after the last time I saw her. I was a wreck when she died because I lived with her for a portion of my life. I could tell the last time I saw her she didn't have as much energy as she used to. Can't remember seeing her able to get around without a wheel chair or not needing adult diapers. She wasn't blind or deaf but was always in pain. I wasn't surprised when she died. The only time I remember seeing my great-grandmother aware was when I was really young and then all I saw her do was sit on the couch not doing anything.\n\nI do understand death and I do understand growing old sucks. I think about all the people I've seen who are just gone now. It's a lot. Not just my grandparents but teachers and other adults I knew as a kid who are gone. I still get afraid to answer the phone because I'm scared the news will be death again. So many of them seemed like they had more to do or wanted to do and death stopped them. This is probably why I say I want to live even when things stop working and I want the dog to live. I get that the dog is old and there's more things wrong with the dog than right, but just from what I've seen in my life people hang on until the end and that's what I think the dog should do.\n\nEdit: after writing all this I ended up crying for a few minutes from reliving all that and realized that I'm not actually arguing about the dog. I still personally don't think the dog should be killed, but that's not what all this has become. Seems I'm relating this to my inability to cope with the death of my grandparents and others. I think I'm done with this topic now and I want icecream. ngl it hurt when you said i haven't seen these issues first hand because it's really not true.", "My dog also has arthritis. We give her supplements and CBD oil and she still gets around ok. She still loves to play fetch and seems to be pretty with it mentally for the most part. She still has a good quality of life and I've discussed all this with her vet. I don't understand letting an animal deteriorate to this point and refusing to really address what's going on.", "\"Its in a lot of pain\"  **is a straight up assumption** You dont know that, OP doesn't say it and theres no indication its suffering. Needing help is not inherently suffering.\n\n\"Dogs can't tell you when they are.\" *Not according to the majority of other people here who say they can.* Behavioral changes and other signs are how animals communicate, which us why observation and awareness are important skills for pet owners. Cats are notorious for hiding health issues, doesn't stop people from keeping them as pets.\n\nAnd most purebreds have health issues. Bulldogs, labradors, boston terriers... some are worse than others but humans have done weird things to dogs, yeah. Thats an issue with breeding and selection for trait over health, not about elderly pet care. I agree people should care about breeding healthy animals, but I'm not going to kill every flat-faced pet that currently exists. Id adopt one and love it if that was the situation. I can have empathy and advocate for stopping irresponsible people breeding them.", "I hope you have someone you can talk to about all this, it's not healthy to keep these things bottled up. Get yourself some ice cream, get help from a friend or a professional, and believe me when I say things will get better.", "There are a lot of self help books about grief, end of life care, and all the emotions about this. There's also books and other media about health issues near end of life and quality of life as a whole.\n\n\nIt seems that your view of death makes death the worst thing in life. Whereas for most people, there are plenty of things worse than death. Dealing with death and illness isn't necessarily something kids and young people are really helped through, since typically the parents are mourning too. \n\n\nIt might be good for you to read these and discuss your past and what you've gleaned from these books in therapy. It seems you've got a lot to come to terms with and your past is potentially clouding your view on more topics that you were previously aware of.\n\n\nBUT you have started to realise this. And that's the first step! This is HUGE! I really hope you find the care and help you need to deal with the past, I think more of us have these things in our brains than we realise. I wish you luck!"]}
