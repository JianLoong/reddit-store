My mom was happy I was finally going to have a relationship with him, even if it took me being close to adulthood for it to happen. I was able to appreciate how I was brought up the longer I stayed, and now get to enjoy having a relationship with both parents. No matter how good step parents are, a lot of us kids still feel abandoned when one parent isn't in the picture. This has the potential to bring her some peace, which is something you should want for her. If you continue behaving this way until she leaves, you have the potential to push her away even more. Whether you like it or not, it's her decision now. The only thing you can do is be supportive and loving, and if you do that she'll come back on her own.\n\nEdit: Just read in the comments that the dude didn't even know he had a kid until 3 months ago when you asked him for money. YTA. He didn't even get to be in his daughters life and is now jumping at the chance. Yall took 14 years from him and are trying to take the rest too.

However, he has rights now.\n\nGrounding your daughter over a predictable teenaged outburst was petty, and makes me wonder if you really did raise her as your own, and if you don't want her to move out because that would mean YOU (plural) would owe the biodad child support.\n\nI am sure your feelings were hurt, but your injuries are self-inflicted.", "YTA of course she's going to want to try and connect with her bio dad. The only way you wouldn't be the AH in this situation is if you were actually concerned about your daughter going to live with someone she doesn't know that well, biological father or not. \n\nIt also sounds like you're taking a her reserved personality personally and projecting.", "YTA - She\u2019s a child.  It seems like you are the one making her choose, she said she wanted to live with him, not cut ties with you forever.", "YTA \n1. Your abusive behavior\n2. You defrauding the bio dad and or the government.", "So I need more context. Since she is 14, did bio dad know about her since birth or recently? I ask because, based on how she was conceived was a bit messy. I also wonder if you treat her differently since she isn't your bio daughter compared to her older sibling. I also do not think grounding her was right. There's a reason why she is cold towards both of you and even though her reasons appear selfish for wanting to be with her bio dad over being with the parents that raised her; something also tells me she have been feeling like she doesn't belong with you all(I know that feeling all too well from my childhood) and this was possibly the opportunity that she was dreaming and waiting for.\n\nYou and your wife are entitled to your feelings. But to punish her is only going to make her resent you both and push her further away.

You lied to her for her entire life, and I believe you probably did treat her differently to her sibling, and she picked up on it, then you have financial issues and decide her biological father might come in handy, so you blindside both of them, and now you're angry he wants to get to know his daughter and she also wants the same.", "It really reads to me like your relationship with Sara is very unhealthy. She\u2019s less affectionate than her sister and that somehow makes her a worse daughter? Somehow it means that she doesn\u2019t love you? People have different love languages, not everyone expresses their affection with copious amounts of hugs and \u201eI love you\u201ds, but it doesn\u2019t mean that their love is worse in any way.\n\nShe\u2019s 14, and she has just met her bio dad who\u2019s now dangling all of these shiny opportunities in front of her: her own room, college tuition, you gotta understand this has to be HUGE for her. She\u2019s a protagonist in her own movie, and she\u2019s likely experiencing the biggest plot twist of her life, OF COURSE she wants to jump at it like there\u2019s no tomorrow because right now all she can see is the cool things she\u2019s being promised and no downsides. You know, because she\u2019s 14?\n\nThere were so many ways to handle this and you chose the worst possible one. You could\u2019ve explained it to her that you love her and you won\u2019t just hand her over out of the blue. That these promises were made by someone who\u2019s still a stranger to her and can easily be withdrawn. You could\u2019ve offered to let her stay with her bio dad for a week, so she sees if she even enjoys living with him. But no, let\u2019s establish dominance by taking away her property and the ability to talk to her father. Congratulations, you just made sure she wants to stay with you even less. YTA", "YTA. If you want a healthy relationship with your step daughter, you need to allow her to see her dad. Don't ground her for it. If she wants to stay with her dad, let her. She'll resent you if you hold her back from doing so.", "EDIT: YTA. I still think Sara was being dramatic, but her level of AH-ness is so overshadowed by your AH-ness, I won't even count it. \n\nSara is 14. She sees something shiny and new and thinks it's amazing. She was being a teenager, and bratty teenagers say dramatic things for maximum effect, lol\n\nBUT, instead of asking her WHY she seems so quick to jump ship, you just cut her off. Like yeah, what she said sucks, and maybe she just wanted to get a rise out of you, etc., but maybe something is legit bothering her at home. Maybe she vented to biodad, an adult outsider (which makes him \"cool\"). But instead of talking, you just took away her electronics and grounded her, lol. I guarantee that that makes biodad 100% cooler.\n\nWe're obviously only getting a tiny glimpse into the situation, but I feel like the fact that you reacted so terribly - I get that you're hurt, but your reaction was still terrible - might be why she sees biodad as the better option. \"I hate living at home. Dad never listens to me.\" *goes home, says something Dad doesn't like, loses phone and electronics, gets grounded*", "YTA You realize you've given her even more reasons to choose her bio dad over you, right? Also it's probably obvious to her that Jade is your favorite.", "YTA, \nNo doubt. \n\nI was adopted by my step dad, when I was old enough to develop a relationship on my own with my bio dad, my step dad got all sorts of offended. He could never and still doesn\u2019t understand the need to know where you came from. He never forgave me. Still to this day he refuses to talk to me. They only thing you are doing is driving a wedge between you and her even more. \n\nYou grounded her for wanting to know her father. That\u2019s absurd. This isn\u2019t about you, this isn\u2019t about her mother. This is about her wanting to know her father. \nYou are being extremely selfish and your ego is out of control. You need to back off and let her find out who she is and where she came from. \n\nYou should also beg for her forgiveness if you ever want to have a real relationship with her. \nThis is just horrible.", "YTA, honestly how could you see it otherwise? You're supposed to be the parent not the petulant child.", "Let's see if I have this straight.\n\n* You and your wife only told bio dad \"a few months ago\" that he had a daughter.\n* You only contacted him when you were having financial difficulties and wanted him to pay child support.  You do realize that you have handed him an easy way to file for custody, right?  Even if your name is on the birth certificate you have now legally informed him that he is the bio dad.\n* You didn't want to, but you let her meet him.  All he has to do is get a DNA test and take it to court.  Not very difficult in this day and age, especially when she visited him.\n* \"Sara is a bit...Cold. I don't even think she loves her mom or me and it has always bothered us but now it's a problem for us.\"  Seems to me there might be a reason for that.  I don't care if you only see her wife's features in her face, you both seem to react to her differently.\n* Bio dad has suddenly found out he has a daughter and starts reacting positively by wanting to get to know her and provide for her college education.  He knows the only reason you let him know about Sara is because you want his money.\n* When she says she wants to go live with him (apparently with a lot of justifications) you over-reacted and essentially put her in jail.\n\nYTA.  Big time AH.  You are trying to extort money from bio dad, have alienated your \"daughter,\" and now have \"grounded\" her and taken away all her electronics.  **(The following is sarcasm.  I'm making that clear to you because your original post shows a total lack of awareness.)**  Why in the world would Sara want to leave?

She wants to forge some kind of relationship with her bio dad so you ground her? For what? What did she do wrong? Did she take a swing at you while telling you this? Did she cuss you out during the conversation? What horrible thing did she do to get grounded? I think the more important situation is...are you a step dad or did you sign the birth certificate? Bc if you signed the birth certificate you aren\u2019t a step dad you adopted her so you are dad. Did bio dad get put on the birth certificate? Has he been paying child support? Where has he been all this time? You should be asking more important questions like is he a safe person for your daughter to be living with. Also if he hasn\u2019t paid child support and he wants to help by covering college why wouldn\u2019t you let him so your daughter can have success without being strapped with debt?", "Yta, you just want money and thats why you told her.

And if she had been your bio child, what would have you done then? You and your wife made the decision 14yrs ago to raise her together, that means YOU accepted all financial responsibility towards her too.\n\nIf she's always acted distant and cold towards you both, that speaks volumes in how you have treated her, indirectly or not.

Then he reaches out and wants to meet her, and wants to have her in his life, and offers her the option for her to go live with him, and she expresses her desire to do so (based on reasons that pretty much any teenager would want). And instead of having a conversation about it, agreeing to think about how you could make the situation work, talking with everyone involved about how you might be able to arrange some kind of compromise or joint custody, you have a shouting match with a 14 year old and punish her for expressing that she wants to live with her bio father?

I can understand your frustration with her wanting to leave because she thinks it will be better, but you handled it really poorly.", "At that age they really are clueless about the feelings of others.  But even so she should be able to have an open dialogue without fear of being punished.   If he's only been around for 3 months I wouldn't let her go.  But let her know him more.  She's probably more curious than anything.   She does come from him and she probably wants to know him better. I met my dad when I was 16 and eventually I was disappointed.", "Yta \n\nShe's 17.  What do you expect to happen?  She's going to change her mind and form a new personality?  You're reinforcing her decision to go.", "YTA.\nGrounding a kid for choosing a parent is parental alienation. Also she is 14 the court will allow her anyway.", "YTA. As you said, it was her choice to meet her dad, so you let her. Why can't she choose who she wants as her family? Also, why the f would you yell at her? You could have talked about it instead of yelling at her and taking her electronics. You should really consider apologizing to her. \n\nEdit: English is not my first language", "I understand why you're hurt but YTA. The way you've handled this is awful. Firstly, only letting bio dad know about his daughter when you needed money is disgusting. No wonder he wants to offer her the world, he's missed 14 years of her life. People have a strong desire to know where they came from so your daughter wants a strong bond with her bio dad, he's compensating for lost time by trying to give her anything she wants OF COURSE she is being swept away in it. She's a child. \n\nI don't know how Sara is treated in your home and I won't speculate but she clearly isn't happy. Maybe it's just that she's aware shes not your bio daughter, maybe there's more to it, but I'd reflect on that. Punishing her for a reaction that is normal for a child is unreasonable. You have just demonstrated that you care more about being seen as parents than her happiness.\n\nWhat I would be concerned about, and agree with is that your daughter shouldn't move in with bio dad. Yet. 3 months is a honeymoon phase, Sara has met her dad and thinks she's going to live like a princess but things don't work like that. I would be working out some shared custody agreement, time for all of you to spend together to work out a plan that suits everyone. If, later down the line, Sara wants to live with her dad full time, you may have to let her and tell her she is always welcome to come back if she wants to.\n\nI hope it all works out.", "INFO: is the reason you do not want her to move in with her bio dad because that would mean you wouldn\u2019t be able to get child support?", "YTA for yelling at a 14 year old.

And there's no reason for him to willingly pay child support just because you are in a need of money. \n\nI doubt any court would order bio dad to pay child support for a child that he was not aware exists for 14 years and already has a father written in a birth certificate. \n\nYou let her have contact with him despite his past, if he was so bad why would you bring him back to your lives?

Go the nuclear option.", "He doesn't live close to us so she can't come to our home in weekdays and knowing her I doubt she'd bother to come in weekends either so yes she basically said she wants to cut ties with us", "OP said in a comment that bio dad was only told about the daughter a few months ago. OP further commented that they didn't want him around the daughter, but he and wife are having financial difficulties. They only told bio dad so they could start getting child support.", "Biodad didn't even know about the kid until recently, and only because OP and wife wanted child support according to OP's comment. He's not newly waltzing in, he's finally being given an opportunity to have a relationship with the daughter he didn't know he had. I don't blame the kid for wanting to get away from these people if this is how they treat people. YTA 100%", "I think this is the most balanced response here. OPs upset is understandable but so is Sara's behaviour and OPs reaction is really unconstructive.", "They didn't tell bio dad until recently either.", "There was no need. Since I was married to her mom at the time I was legally her dad", "Right? No way this is real. YTA", "People have pointed out that he/wife wouldn't receive money from biodad (the whole reason why they even revealed to the man, 14 years late, that he had a daughter was to sink their claws into his bank account) if she moved out.", "Worse! She's 14.", "you might want to change your vote. op didn\u2019t tell the dad about sara until a few months ago, and only did it because he wanted money from the guy. sara just found out that op wasn\u2019t her dad, that\u2019s all on op and his wife, therefore, assholes", "I think the fact you \"thank god\" she looks like your wife illustrates that you view Sara differently and there's no way she won't have picked up on that. Given that, its not surprising that she wants to try living with her bio Dad. She's 14 and just found out the situation and then finding out that the only reason she knows is because you're intending to claim financial support is a major thing to contend with. She's probably feeling pretty confused, betrayed and hurt.\nI'd be looking at therapy pronto for all of you and stop punishing her for a situation she didn't create. She needs an apology, her stuff back and a giant hug. You and wife may be hurt and angry but you're adults and she isn't. The responsibility to address this properly rests with you. Like it or not, bio Dad is in her life and continuing down this road will alienate her completely.\n\nAnd YTA", "So, she probably felt all her life that you treated her differently than her sister. She has the right to know her father. And if you don't let her, she'll be gone when she's 18.", "Thank you for confirming you have been a bad and abusive parent to Sara her entire life.", "Correction - so devastated that she wanted to move out of your house and into his.", "SHE WAS IN SHOCK!", "Wow. You just keep making yourself sound worse and worse with every statement you make. You are so completely and  unbelievably cruel to this kid.\n\nEven by your slanted telling of the story, you upended her life and are exposing her to an abuser for some cash and don't even have the decency to think what you are doing has any impact on her mental health.\n\nIt sounds like you are more interested in the cash than her well being. You don't get to have your cake and eat it too. She isn't even important enough to you   to consider what your lying and greed and manipulative behavior are doing to her.\n\nIt is no wonder she is taking the 1st opportunity possible GTFO of your house.", "Well, guess she\u2019s just giving back what she\u2019s getting from you.\n\nYOU decided that since Sarah is not as affectionate as Jade that she\u2019s cold and you obviously treat her coldly. Your comments reek of resentment towards her. You do realize that she\u2019s freaking 14?! Of course she\u2019s giving you a cold shoulder back, you don\u2019t deserve better!\n\nDo you read what you\u2019re typing, like seriously reading it?\n\nBio dad is supposedly some abuser your wife had to protect herself from, but never contacted her until you two decided that you want more money. Now all of the sudden he\u2019s good enough to write a cheque and meet Sarah?!\nI\u2019m starting to think she\u2019ll be better off with a complete stranger than you and your wife. \n\nAh, and I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re mad because if she really goes to live with her bio dad no pay cheque for you.\n\nYTA", "You sound like a peach. I can't imagine why Sara would feel alienated from such a loving family.", "You're so cold jesus christ", "Maybe you should have mentioned that. \"My wife had another man's child and we both kept it a secret from him for 14 years, and now we're upset that he has the audacity to try to form a relationship with his daughter, and that she's overly sympathetic to him.\"\n\nHas Sara known all her life that you're not her father or when did you tell her that and what was she told about the whereabouts of her father and why he never contacted her?", "Holy fuck, that's so wrong. He should have known from the beggining", "You and her mom are TA. If your name is on the birth certificate you can\u2019t come after him for support. You accepted that responsibility by putting your name in there. It just gets worse and worse the more info we get. This situation is just gross. SMH", "Probably the best thing for her. Moving far away from you all. If I were her biodad, I'd go to court for full custody. Get her away from your abusive and toxic household.", "I did read that after posting this. Ty.", "Oh, that wasn't clear from the original post. YIKES", "And only because they wanted money from him", "If you are legally her dad then why did you go to the bio dad asking for child support? You are your wife are 100% financially responsible for Sara. Not a man who wasn't even told he had a child and has no legal rights to said child.", "Well, if that's really the case, he has no legal right to have her live with him.  And if you're her legal father...you'd have no right to child support.  But since he's her bio dad and never knew that, he clearly has legal standing. \n\nYTA - you don't go asking the bio dad for money, after 14 years of not knowing she existed (and it's not clear to me if she knew she had a different father), and then act surprised that you just threw a monkey wrench into all of your lives.  \n\nYou guys created this situation, you damn well better be super supportive to your daughter.  If she goes to live with him, it may not work for long, she may need a place to come back to.  You guys really made a mess of this.", "Your name is on the birth certificate?", "~~That's...not how that works legally.~~\n\nNevermind, name is on the birth certificate", "Then you have no right to child support. At all. You\u2019re her father in the eyes of the law.\n\nYou can\u2019t have it both ways. If she\u2019s your daughter, you support her.", "Being married to her mom didn\u2019t legally make you her dad", "You're right... I was looking at the wrong sister.\n\nThey should check the laws in their state.  Sometimes kids as young as 12 can pick who to live with, assuming the bio dad has established paternity and there's a legal relationship.\n\nIf the 14 yo is on solid ground to choose where to live after a simple court hearing, then they should stop antagonizing her and negotiate generous visitation. They shouldn't push her into digging her heels in and feeling like she can never return.\n\nI have to wonder how she's doing socially, because most 14 yo wouldn't leave their friends and change schools.  Does her sister bully her?  Is there a problem they could help her address that might make her want to stay?", "he didn't specify those details when i made my comment", "An excellent point! Can't get cash if his cash cow doesn't reside on the premises and is being directly taken care of by living with biodad. I feel more and more sorry for this poor girl and more and more disgusted by her \"loving parents\" with every comment I read", "He isn't exatly a decent guy we didn't want him around her. We only told him because we were having financial problems and really needed the child support", "Yes", "Still that's not how it works", "I hate to agree with this guy on anything, but in some states it does. In Arkansas if you are married and have baby your husband is legally the father regardless of biology. There\u2019s ways to fight it in court, but as far as what automatically goes, husbands the legal father regardless of genetic father", "Really, only coming to a guy for money? After alienating his daughter from him? Reacting so harshly when she says something you don't like?\n\nIt sounds like you guys aren't exactly decent people", "This makes you an even bigger a-hole than I initially thought you were. Your wife too. YTA\n\nAlso making me question your other comment about his abusive behavior and who deserves what. Especially when your behavior towards your stepdaughter seems abusive. If you thought he wasn't a good dude, you wouldn't have let him into her life. You would have protected her at all costs. But you didn't seem that concerned when you wanted money from him.\n\nPs: Your stepdaughter is probably giving back what she gets from you. You might want to look into the mirror if you want to know who to blame for her behavior. \n\nEdited.", "This makes you look so fucking bad I can't believe you typed it out and felt justified. Sorry buddy he doesn't owe you shit since you're the bame on the birth certificate. Also, knowingly signing your name on a birth certificate of a child that's not yours is a felony in some states.", "There are...So many things here that make you and your wife massive assholes. I'm just confused as to how on earth you actually think you might not be the asshole in this situation?! \n\nYour post made you look bad enough. But you only even told her bio dad to get money from him after FOURTEEN YEARS?!", "You and your wife are hardly the best people to be casting judgements on others, especially as you both essentially hid his child from him until you decided the mo ey he has could come in handy. No wonder his daughter has decided which parent she'd rather live with", "Jesus Fucking Christ. You have an opportunity to present yourself in the best possible light and this is how you decide to present yourself?", "Should've gone through the courts then, now I'm sure he can talk to a lawyer and start the fight for custody", "So, you wan't the money but your daughter has to shut up and isn't allowed to see her father. Yeah, YTA.", "Hm, so as the cold and calculating ppl you and your wife obviously are, you decided this guy should not know about his daughter till you wanted his money and now you are shocked your daughter is acting cold and wants to move in with her dad bc he offered her a better financial deal... i wonder where she picked up this cold and calculating behaviour. Lol\n\nIf 3 out of 4 ppl in your household are cold and calculating (at least in some situations) you should rather be grateful your older daughter didn't turned out this way too than blaming your younger daughter.", "DUDE WHAT THE FUCK", "So you and your wife committed fraud then?", "Ok cool. You\u2019re her dad I guess! And that means that her bio dad has NO legal ties to her, meaning that your little \u2018get child support from him\u2019 plan will not work. So what was the REAL reason he was finally told?\nBc to me, all this complaining about your CHILD reads like you don\u2019t actually like her very much. And that she knows it. And that you don\u2019t actually care she wants to leave, other than the fact that you know it makes you look bad that you\u2019ve treated your child so shittily she\u2019d rather live with a stranger.", "Basically you are a criminal. Interesting", "Actually it is most of the places I know.\n\nBio dad can move to change that though.", "I love the hypocrisy that OP and mom can dump 'hey you've got a kid' on bio-dad for money, but if their daughter wants to basically do the same thing and use her dad for money, suddenly that's the worst thing they've ever heard and she's terrible", "He was abusive to my wife he didn't deserve to be in her life\n\nSaying something I don't like? She didn't tell me she doesn't like the dinner I made she told me she wants to move out of my home", "Indeed. He can challenge it easily. The birth certificate is getting more and more irrelevant", "That's a pretty typical thing to say for a 14 year old, so yeah, I still count that as saying something you didn't like", "> He isn't exatly a decent guy we didn't want him around her. We only told him because we were having financial problems and really needed the child support\n\nSo you were letting an abusive man pay you to be around a 14yr old girl? Alone? In fact you contacted and abusive man to to pay you to you to hang around your 14yr old daughter?", "I thought your daughter was the 14 year old, but you seem to be behaving as one much more than she is.\n\nI'm entirely confortable to now say YTA.", "So his money was good enough? It is horrible to not tell someone they are going to be a parent. Did you only recently tell your daughter you are not her bio dad or did she find out a few months ago when she became an easy way for money?", "So she says. Or do you know  first hand? Regardless its fine to be in contact with him for me, even if he is abusive. - you and your wife set that precedent.", "Say it louder so his ridiculous wife at the back can hear it too!", "I was about to say this too. You should have taken his abusiveness into consideration before introducing him to your daughter. Also shouting at a child that has already emotionally withdrawn from you will never ever induce them to love, trust and obey you."]}
