I am from a Roman Catholic Family and my parents are older (71 and 67) and my sister (32). \n\nBecause of my life choices, my family and I are fairly estranged. I do not practice their faith anymore, while they are weekly church goers who actively participate in church gatherings and events. They have not accepted my transition, and still commonly use my deadname (male name) despite how I changed it nearly 3 years ago. \n\nI will visit 3-4 times per year, and occasionally exchange texts, but for the most part, we widely do not interact except at holidays. It\u2019s not uncommon to go months between texts, and pleasantries are pretty barebones and surface level. For context, I am treated as the \u201cfamily secret\u201d or black sheep or the family. I began transitioning in 2019, and my mother did not tell her extended family until fall of 2022. \n\nAbout 7 months ago, my sister announced she was getting married. I didn\u2019t even hear about the engagement until almost 2 weeks after she said yes, and from my parents social media post no less. No one bothered to tell me. \n\nShe is holding a Roman Catholic wedding, but because I am transgender, she specifically has not included me in any bridal party activities, wedding planning, etc. No one invited me to the wedding shower, I was not asked to participate in the ceremony, I was simply sent a save the date in the mail like any other normal wedding guest. \n\nI was specifically told I was not going to be in the wedding party, and my partner was not welcome either. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m just trying to be polite by still attending the wedding. Today, my mother texted me less than 2 weeks before the wedding asking if I could wear a navy pant suit to the wedding. I absolutely do not want to wear a pant suit, nor is there any time before the wedding to realistically have an outfit custom fitted even if I agreed to. \n\nI have no plans to wear inappropriate clothing, I plan to dress like any 30 something year old female guest would dress like normally. But my parents are becoming increasingly pushy and hostile that I suddenly conform to a specific type of clothing, specifically something that would make me look like a man like a pant suit \u201cor something with slacks\u201d. \n\nI am very noticeably feminine. I have been transitioning for just under 5 years, and so wearing a pant suit I\u2019d still look quite feminine, but I know my parents want me to wear a suit because it\u2019s acceptable clothing for what a \u201cman\u201d would wear.\n\nBecause my family went so out of their way to tell me how *UNINVOLVED* I will be in this wedding, I think it\u2019s wildly rude they suddenly want a say in how I dress and present myself. \n\nHad my family included me in the bridal party, I would have gone along no question. But because they didn\u2019t I think I\u2019m perfectly in line and my parents are going too far. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1701196104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1862xjl/aita_for_telling_my_family_ill_wear_what_i_want/", "score": 2129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s simple to say \u201cjust don\u2019t go, they don\u2019t deserve your company,\u201d but family is family, fortunately or unfortunately, and this is a big event that\u2019s (potentially) only going to happen once. I would say if you still plan to attend dress how you feel comfortable, within the dress code, and be in and out. I wouldn\u2019t get into it at the wedding or give your family any extra time to come after you, just go to the bare minimum, send a moderately priced gift with a simple note, and move on. If I had to guess, they\u2019ll be on their best behavior at the wedding festivities, so don\u2019t spend any alone time with them if possible and attend like a normal guest would, because that\u2019s how they\u2019re treating you. Keep it short and sweet, if they try to make a scene that\u2019s on them, be polite, but gtfo as soon as is acceptable. Again, so sorry, sending love!", "INFO: Why, exactly, are you going to this wedding? From the sounds of it, your sister and parents have been royal AHs to you for years, and this wedding has just highlighted their AHery.\n\nHere's what you said in your OP:\n\n>I am treated as the \u201cfamily secret\u201d or black sheep or the family...About 7 months ago, my sister announced she was getting married. I didn\u2019t even hear about the engagement until almost 2 weeks after she said yes, and from my parents social media post no less. No one bothered to tell me.\n\nIt sounds like they sent you a wedding invitation only because you found out that your sister was getting married. That sounds to me like they didn't give a damn whether you knew or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She...specifically has not included me in any bridal party activities, wedding planning, etc. No one invited me to the wedding shower, I was not asked to participate in the ceremony, I was simply sent a save the date in the mail like any other normal wedding guest.I was specifically told I was not going to be in the wedding party, and my partner was not welcome either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd take all of that as a big slap in the face. Maybe several slaps in the face.\n\nYou said you're planning to go to the wedding to \"be polite.\" Why? It sounds like they don't actually want you there, and it's not like they're being polite to you.\n\nSaying, \"You can come, but your partner can't\" is usually met with, \"If my partner's not welcome, then I'm not going.\" Do you really want to stand for having your partner be excluded like that?\n\nI think the pantsuit thing is the least of your concerns, here. If I were you, I'd suddenly not be able to go to this thing. I realize it's only 2 weeks away, so your parents and/or sister will have to deal with the seating chart and catering, but that's nothing compared to the gut-twisting experience that going to this wedding would be for you.\n\nWear what you want on your sister's wedding day, and spend that day with people who respect you as you are, far away from that wedding.", "NTA.\n\n\"Unless you're asking all the other women at the wedding to wears slacks or pantsuits, it's wildly inappropriate to single me out.\"\n\nIf they're going to be that uptight about it, you might want to consider skipping the ceremony. \n\nHave you talked to your sister about all of this? Is it coming from her or is it just your mom that's making all of this commotion?", "NTA but I wouldn't bother going at all.", "\"Mom/Dad, I will dress in something that is appropriate for the wedding\".  That's all you need to say.  Then wear what you want.  Be prepared, though, they may bar you from entering.\n\nPersonally, I would be cutting them out of my life for treating me the way you are being treated, but I can understand why one wouldn't.   NTA.", "NTA, not even remotely. Frankly showing up at all is above and beyond for these people\n\n> At this point, I\u2019m just trying to be polite by still attending the wedding.\n\nWhat part of this story depicts them deserving you being polite to them?\n\nAnd you got it right, your mom wants you to wear a pantsuit so she can \"save face\" for the \"shame\" of having a daughter who is living her life authentically instead of according to her backwards bronze-age mythology. Fuck that. Show up in clothes that make you comfortable or just don't show up, neither would make you the asshole.\n\nBut seriously, to each their own, I get family is complicated, but I cannot fathom why you want to be around these people.", "NTA. But if you love your sister, do not go.\n\n\nYour parents and sister are unaccepting of you, and anything you do or say will be misconstrued and suddenly the whole wedding and reception will become all about you: how well you have transitioned; how you're not part of the wedding party; the appropriateness of your clothing.\n\n\nAnd then you will have upstaged the bride, which is fodder for more family drama in which you are the villain.\n\n\nJust spare yourself the misery. Don't give your energy to people who have no appreciation for you.", "NTA, but you're in a tough spot. First things first, talk to your sister and if she would be OK with your choice. If yes, then issue solved. If no, then either try to attend in a navy suit or (what I would recommend) just don't attend. If your sister can't get over your clothing, then I don't think she cares that much about you.\nEDIT: Thanks to u/EdwinaArkie, I replaced attend in a suit  with try to attend in a suit.", "You and your family are estranged. Have been for years now. You're considered a \"dirty little secret\" who they don't support or show the slightest bit of love or concern for. \n\nSimple.\n\nDon't go.\n\nSpend the day with your partner and/or friends doing something you enjoy surrounded by people that actually give a fuck about *you*. \n\nProblem solved.\n\nNTA.", "OP, please hear me when I tell you: who you are is not a \"lifestyle choice,\" it is who you are! You did not choose to be the person you were born to be; you can only choose to live openly and authentically as yourself.\n\nAs a nonbinary person who presents very dissimilarly to by assigned gender, I feel your hurt on all this. I know what it's like to want to at least maintain the tenuous ties you have to people who don't understand / support you, and also to want to maintain the moral high ground of NOT being the person who cuts the other off / is \"in the wrong\" or can be blamed for the relationship breakdown. I'd imagine these are some of the reasons you're going to this wedding even though it's not a good scene for you. There's no easy answer here.\n\nFirst: You're not the asshole. You are not an asshole for existing in your body as yourself. If it would be weird for your family to force your dad to wear a dress, it would also be weird for them to force you to wear a suit. It's not who you are.\n\nSecond: How much do you want to go to the wedding? If you don't want to go, you can write your sister a letter. Tell her you love her, but that there's been so much tension about your arrival and appearance that you feel your participation/attendance would cause a distraction from the main event: her celebration of her marriage. For that reason, you won't be at the ceremony. Tell her you aren't making this about you; you simply want the focus to be on her and you can tell from the reactions of your family that your appearance and identity are becoming too much a topic of conversation and fretting. Wish her well. Send a gift. Let your family sort themselves out. \n\nDon't say anything about being told to wear a suit, etc. Don't make it about clothes. Don't make it about YOU, even. Make it about other people's responses to your identity and how they are distracted from the point of the event. Then, move on.\n\nThird: If you really want to go to the wedding, ask for a plus one. Bring a supportive friend. Attend in the clothing you choose. Leave when you're ready to leave. Do this all on your terms.  \n\n\nI'm sending so much love and hope your way. This is hard.", "INFO\n\nWhat does your **sister** want? It's clear what your *parents* want and how they feel, but what does your sister want?\n\nDoes she want you to attend with your +1? Does she want you to attend by yourself, dressed as you wish? Does *she* want you to wear slacks? Or (and I'm sorry but we have to cover all our bases) does your sister even want you there?\n\nBecause if your sister says \"I want my sister there and I want her to be there as herself\", then you showing up in an appropriate dress is NTA.\n\nIf your sister says \"I want you there, but I don't want a scene between you guys on my wedding day\", then if you showed up dressed in a way that will cause a scene and take attention away from the bride and groom, YTA. EDIT: if this really is how your sister feels, I would say \"don't go to the wedding at all\", which is NTA too. \"I won't attend a wedding where I'm not welcome\" is absolutely NTA.", "Don't Roman Catholics follow what the Pope does/says?

I was very, very lucky that my come-out was pretty chill, so you have my sympathies that your family sucks. Several disparate thoughts: \n\nI wouldn\u2019t tolerate the no-partner BS. But that\u2019s me. I would hate somebody telling me WTF to wear, and I have no idea about your body type, etc., so I could be off-base, but I would go for malicious compliance. Women\u2019s suits can be VERY sexy and feminine. I would wear a navy trouser suit, heels, jewelry, make-up, get my hair conditioned and nails done. Chemical peel. Teeth whitened. Chanel No. 5.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nTo sum up the situation, I am 29 and a Trans Woman. I am from a Roman Catholic Family and my parents are older (71 and 67) and my sister (32). \n\nBecause of my life choices, my family and I are fairly estranged. I do not practice their faith anymore, while they are weekly church goers who actively participate in church gatherings and events. They have not accepted my transition, and still commonly use my deadname (male name) despite how I changed it nearly 3 years ago. \n\nI will visit 3-4 times per year, and occasionally exchange texts, but for the most part, we widely do not interact except at holidays. It\u2019s not uncommon to go months between texts, and pleasantries are pretty barebones and surface level. For context, I am treated as the \u201cfamily secret\u201d or black sheep or the family. I began transitioning in 2019, and my mother did not tell her extended family until fall of 2022. \n\nAbout 7 months ago, my sister announced she was getting married. I didn\u2019t even hear about the engagement until almost 2 weeks after she said yes, and from my parents social media post no less. No one bothered to tell me. \n\nShe is holding a Roman Catholic wedding, but because I am transgender, she specifically has not included me in any bridal party activities, wedding planning, etc. No one invited me to the wedding shower, I was not asked to participate in the ceremony, I was simply sent a save the date in the mail like any other normal wedding guest. \n\nI was specifically told I was not going to be in the wedding party, and my partner was not welcome either. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m just trying to be polite by still attending the wedding. Today, my mother texted me less than 2 weeks before the wedding asking if I could wear a navy pant suit to the wedding. I absolutely do not want to wear a pant suit, nor is there any time before the wedding to realistically have an outfit custom fitted even if I agreed to. \n\nI have no plans to wear inappropriate clothing, I plan to dress like any 30 something year old female guest would dress like normally. But my parents are becoming increasingly pushy and hostile that I suddenly conform to a specific type of clothing, specifically something that would make me look like a man like a pant suit \u201cor something with slacks\u201d. \n\nI am very noticeably feminine. I have been transitioning for just under 5 years, and so wearing a pant suit I\u2019d still look quite feminine, but I know my parents want me to wear a suit because it\u2019s acceptable clothing for what a \u201cman\u201d would wear.\n\nBecause my family went so out of their way to tell me how *UNINVOLVED* I will be in this wedding, I think it\u2019s wildly rude they suddenly want a say in how I dress and present myself. \n\nHad my family included me in the bridal party, I would have gone along no question. But because they didn\u2019t I think I\u2019m perfectly in line and my parents are going too far. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA\n\nSorry you\u2019re going through this, OP. I get why you don\u2019t go NC and still want to attend.

It just won\u2019t be easy, and you\u2019re under no obligation to do so. Figure out what you want, do just that and let your parents hang themselves in the noose they have knotted.

They don\u2019t respect or accept you for who you are, and it seems unlikely they ever will.", "As someone raised roman catholic: NTA. Your family does not accept you for who you are and they place their gender norms over their prerogative to love you.

You just politely decline.", "NTA, but if your partner isn't welcome, don't attend. It's not a funeral. It's not your final chance to say goodbye to somebody.

Just make it classy.\n\nNTA.", "NTA no matter what you do. \n\nLiterally the only way you could be TA is if you showed up in a white dress (because obviously that\u2019s a total AH move from anyone).

Seriously, it would be so hot and no one could say a damn thing.\n\nI feel like I'm being a little flippant.

Catch up with the people who will be happy for you. There are more than you think.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nSend your sister a picture of what you'd wear to the wedding, and ask if she would prefer to have you there in that outfit or not there. Yes, she's family. If she only wants you there dressed up as a guy, she doesn't actually want *you* there.\n\nEven saying that your partner isn't welcome would be enough for many to refuse the invite...

Don't go.  Make a donation to any Tran based organization in their name and add that to a card congratulating on their wedding.", "NTA. The invitation wasn\u2019t for you - it was for them to feel good about themselves for including family. It\u2019s all for show, hence the clothing demand. \n\nI see two options: either finding the most form-fitting hyper-feminine pant suit off the rack possible and pairing it with sexy heels, or skipping the wedding altogether.

I think the only people I like less than political lefties is religious righties. Religious stuff drives me insane regardless of what the religion is, telling people how they should live their life.

Don't go, save yourself a headache or go find some nice flowy navy pants  ... the ones that look like a long dress. Pick out a cute jacket, one that is short, also in navy.  Get a cute flowered blouse.  Have your hair done in a cute style.  Paint your nails.  Have your makeup done. Pick out jewelry that compliments your outfit.  Wear cute shoes.... something with a low heel unless you are proficient in walking in heels (I'm not, I look clumsy, and I have been a female since birth). Then go to your sister's wedding in your navy suit.  Wish your sister well.  I wouldn't stay for the reception just because your partner isn't included.   As a nice little touch, have your partner pick you up from in front of the church while your sister and parents are still in the receiving line. Make sure you do a little finger wave bye.", "Ask yourself this. Why do you wanna go? NTA btw.", "Oof NTA as well. My wife is in a similar boat. She's been transitioning (transitioned?) For 13 years hasn't had a male name legally in almost as many years. Her dad pretends she's dead. Her mom prays for her (not Catholic I don't even know what flavor of Christianity she is) still uses wrong pronouns and dead name. You could not go and save yourself trouble. \nBut you can go and wear whatever the hell you want. There will be some annoying parts to going like anyone who stares or says terrible things to your face. But you'll also get all the old biddies up in a tither and your parents won't like that which is fun (for me anyway). Also you may find family, friends of family or whatever that are accepting Catholics, woke Catholics or accepting/woke non Catholics and that will be nice too.", "Why are you going? To cause drama?

Assuming it\u2019s because you\u2019re happy for your sister and you want to support/celebrate her, then this has nothing to do with your parents. They are only doing this because they are worried about having to explain you to their friends\u2026which they don\u2019t have to do if they don\u2019t want to, so this is a them problem, not a you problem. \n\nIf you go, wear what you are comfortable in and bring your partner, just like any other wedding guest would :)", "NTA.

I love my \u201ckids\u201d (grown and almost grown) so much, and part of that love is accepting who they are as long as they\u2019re not harming others.

Or if there is a semblance of that dead named person physically. Or nitpicking masc or fem features on their faces/bodies. Then they spiral down. Overall feeling very alien in their own body. I\u2019m not sure if this is a similar occurrence with you.\n\nYou said that you visit your family 3-4 times a year. I\u2019m sure that those visits are not very pleasant especially growing up through the lens of catholicism with very stereotypical views on gender and gender roles. \n\nQuestion: When you visit, do you present more masc or do you wear fem clothes?  \n\nI understand ties to biological family members, and I know that simply \u201ccutting them off\u201d is no simple task. But if you want to keep them in your life you should set up some healthy boundaries. I recommend attending therapy with a psychologist specializing in LGBTQIA+ and gender affirming therapy if possible. I say this because in your above post you said \u201cBecause of my life choices, my family and I are fairly estranged.\u201dThis leads me to believe there is some self blame for your family situation which I truly hope you do not believe.\n\nOnce you are comfortable with your psychologist I recommend suggesting family therapy with them. Even if you are moving they will still be your family. Maybe virtual sessions might be good. If you want to maintain a relationship, they need to prove to you how much they love you and respect you. Not only as family but as a human being. This needs to be in their language (no more dead naming), in their actions (therapy), and their willingness to set aside their bias. If they cannot do that, then they do not love you as you are. They love the idea of you and the idea of what you might have been if you were not you. \n\nBlood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. At the end of the day the people who love and accept you for who you are will be more family to you than those who purposely exclude you from participating in huge family events. You need to do what\u2019s best for you. Mentally, physically, spiritually. Don\u2019t let people related to you hurt you. People deserve to be seen as they are. You are included. You are not responsible for perpetuating their restrictive ideas. \n\nSituation thoughts:\nIf you are going to the wedding dressed how you want, you will be a spectacle or juicy gossip for the community even if you dress as a respectable woman in her 30\u2019s. If you go to the wedding in a pantsuit you will not be your authentic self and the big day and memories you wanted to make will be cheapened because you only conformed to who they wanted you to be. Either way you will have eyes on you the entire day for unpleasant reasons. Even in a pantsuit you will be a girl. And your family will probably dead name you leading to confusion and speculation. This is not a lasting memory with your family that you will want to remember before you move. As they are right now, even if this is a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d event it would be a bad time for everyone involved no matter what you wear. If you don\u2019t mind the eyes and want to stick it to em. Hell yeah, all the power to you. Go in, dress as you want, do your best, and get out. But, if you just want to fade into the background and witness a happy time for your sister, no amount of trying to blend in will make their eyes burn any less. All that will come from it is self consciousness. Do not even entertain the idea of wearing a pants suit. That\u2019s ridiculous. I recommend therapy.

While I am 100% pro you dressing how you want to dress, I\u2019m inclined to think the better choice may be to not go at all. Especially since you think you want to repair your relationship with your sister. Because while you wearing a dress won\u2019t ruin a wedding, the actions your parents might take actually could. \n\nPerhaps you reach out to your sister. Offer to take her out to dinner and talk. Present the choices. Tell her you want to go to her wedding because you love her and want to be there for her. But going means you\u2019re going to be you. Say if she thinks this will cause unwanted problems you won\u2019t go. Basically, extend the olive branch ahead of the wedding, not at it. \n\nYour parents are terrible. What they\u2019ve told you and how you\u2019re being treated is inexcusable. And for the most part taking a stand is the correct choice. But maybe not at someone\u2019s wedding. Regardless of whether your sister is complicit.", "She avoids you? But you're family!!!", "It's not even mean!", "This is what I was thinking.   Celine Dione was photographed in a black pant suit with pointe pants, a fitted blazer, and only a black lace bra under with a super sleeked back updo. Lady Gaga also wore a very feminine pant suit to an awards show with wide leg trousers, a fitted suit jacket with just the tiniest bit of volume in the shoulders and a satin collar, and nothing underneath.  \nI'd go in the most stunning feminine pant suit I could find with a plunging neck line and wear either nothing, a lace bra, or a silk and lace camisole underneath.   Be 100% compliant but wear a power suit when you pull this power move.  \nThere are some stores you could buy a feminine suit off the rack.   If you are close with a tailor you could pull this off.", "What are fuck me pants? Sounds cute to wear and scandalous", "OMG -- This is FABULOUS !!!!!\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f", "Hopping on the bandwagon here.  This is the outfit, if this is your style, OP.", "It comes in navy!", "Oh hey that's where I got my trashpit of a wedding dress from! (Seriously folks it's the wish for com of wedding dresses. There's a 1% chance you'll get lucky and a 101% chance it's a knock off that looks nothing like the image)", "Pants that look painted on.", "Ooooohh okay got it. Thank you", "I think the younger folx call them thirst traps"]}
