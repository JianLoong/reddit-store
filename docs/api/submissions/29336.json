Holy fuck. Your mom didn't say shit about bikinis! She was talking about her own level of comfort! Gd, not everyone is that constable with their own bodies. Break up with this person. She ain't worth nothing", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your gf is a bully. She wouldn't have liked it if your mom treated her that way about how she was dressing.\n\nYou should seriously reconsider being with someone who treats your mom like this.", "Why the heck are you wasting your time with a mean girl who was raised by a mean girl?

Feminism is about enabling women to have freedom and autonomy, and to do what they feel comfortable with. Your girlfriend's stance is not feminism, it's exhibitionism.", "NTA your girlfriend and her family have very weird personalities and opinions. Feminism includes respecting all women\u2019s choices for their bodies, not forcing them to wear clothes they\u2019re uncomfortable in.", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend is a complete AH and bully", "YTA for letting your GF and her family treat your mother this way.\n\nMy heart breaks for her.  She's alone and she just wants to call you at night to talk about your day.  And she's more religious and modest and she gets berated by your GF and her family.\n\nAND YOU TOLERATE THIS?  Telling her to shut up at the end was completely appropriate but you need to have some serious conversations with your girlfriend about the way she treats your mom.  It's appalling.\n\nAnd this, my dude, has to be among the most disingenuous things posted on AITA:\n\n\"Somehow they both hate each other, I still don't understand why.\"", "Find a new gf.\n\nNTA", "YTA\n\nThis has been going on for 2 years and you didn't break up", "NTA. Wtf she tried to bully your mom in front of you\u2026 wtf?", "NTA. It sounds like your girlfriend is the narrow minded one. Insulting your mom\u2019s clothing choices is just plain petty. Your mom calling to see how your day was is sweet. My mom was one of my best friends before she passed away last year. Anyone who doesn\u2019t like their spouse having a good relationship with their parent is dealing with something internally. \n\nI absolutely would have done the same thing. Being mean just because you don\u2019t like how someone else lives or has a good relationship with their kid is objectively not okay.", "NTA. Also, you need to break up with your GF. If she's this way with your mother now, just imagine how horrible she and her family will be if you get married.", "NTA.  Why do they care about what your mom wears? . It is ok if she was uncomfortable.  they should of been respectful of your moms choice not to wear a bathing suit just as she was respectful of their clothing choice.   This girl isn't a nice girl", "NTA\n\nIt seems like your GF is not the best kind of person mocking your mom all the time, but thats another topic.\n\nAlthough you are from my point of view definitely NTA, there is of course always a better way tha asking someone to shut up in front of other people, because that always leads to more escalation. Telling your GF more privately that she should  please be stopping annoying your mom and then have a proper talk afterwards would have been a good way, but maybe the way your GF behaved it was not worth that effort...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

These things aren't mutually exclusive. \n\nYour GF was being unreasonable. Nobody should dictate what others wear...", "NTA, pal. Your gf isn\u2019t willing to accept your mother as she is, from what I\u2019m hearing. Your mom may not like your gf, but she might be resigned to the idea that you\u2019re going to love who you\u2019re going to love. You might have to decide whether your relationship with your gf is worth setting some stronger boundaries with your mother or you might be able to find someone who finds the way you care for your mother endearing.", "NTA and I'd reconsider the relationship... if I disrespected my BF's parents like that I'd be out the door so fast (and vice versa!)", "NTA.

Like, if all of what you've said about their conflict is a fair snapshot than my takeaway is that your mother dislikes your girlfriend because she's an asshole, and your girlfriend is an narrow minded.\n\nLike, to summarize she doesn't like your mother because she calls you often, she doesn't like your mother because she's single, she doesn't like your mother because she's religious. It was literally all just, \"my girlfriend dislikes these things about my mother\"\n\nThan, to just add a whole capstone to this, your girlfriend and her totes openminded family shamed your mother for not being comfortable wearing skimpy swimwear even to the point that she felt entitled enough to demand your mother prove she was comfortable with showing skin like she was some how owed it.\n\nIf I were you I'd dump her. There is no going back from this, this woman you're with has her head up her ass.", "NTA\nyour gf sounds like a mean person, why does she care so much about what your mom wears? just let her be it\u2019s lit not hurting her", "NTA - holy crap you need a new gf man.", "NTA.

I can hardly think of something less feminist than that.", "She didn't have an audience before. She has most likely been feeding info to her family so that they were ready to attack your mom.", "Mean girls feed off each other.\n\nWhen someone shows you their true colors, believe them. - Dolly Parton", "I'll stop you there. It doesn't matter if your girlfriend's family is worse, and a bad influence on your girlfriend.\n\nYour girlfriend hates your mother.\n\nNothing in what you wrote suggests that your mother objected to your girlfriend putting on a bikini. Instead your girlfriend objected to your mother wearing clothes she was comfortable in. That's unreasonable (and anti feminist). She's being a Mean Girl just because she can.\n\nYou really need to ask yourself who you value more. Because I'm sure there are many other women out there that you could date who would be pleasant to your mother, but there aren't any replacement mothers really.\n\nContinuing to stay with your girlfriend will make your mother's life less enjoyable, is your girlfriend really that special?\n\nYou're not the AH for telling your girlfriend to leave your mother alone. YTA for keeping putting them in situations where your girlfriend feels comfortable bullying your mother", "The thing about bullies is that they're good at faking the good person act, because on some level they admit their behaviour is suspect. Their actions will come out if they think they can get away with it, or they have backing. Your girlfriend has said endless shit about your mother for ages, and then today when present with an entourage she felt empowered to be at her worst.", "It all felt personal to me, like her mom and sister had this agenda pre planned to insult my mom.", "Exactly! I also feel the same way. \nIt was like, her sister and mom planned all this on purpose. They cornered out my mom, insulted her till the very moment I stepped in. Otherwise they were all set on forcing my mom to wear a swimsuit", "From the way you tell it, she's always irrationally disliked your mother", "Yeah, the \"spare swimwear\" suggests as much.  But I think you are giving your GF too much credit--out of all of them, she was the most incentivized to do this because she is the one who thinks you spend too much time talking to your mom.  Her mom and sister were just doing her bidding.", "No. Your gf planned this. Her sister and mom were there to push things. Think about why she wouldn't stop them if she wasn't in on it. Three against one.", "Yes, but I never got to know why.", "Yes, they all were on this agenda to make my mom uncomfortable.", "You have a point! I never understood the reason why she hates my mom.", "So, from the way she talks about the totally normal habit of your mother calling to chat with you, she sounds jealous of y'all's relationship. I don't know if it's because she's in a crap relationship with her mom (doesn't sound like it) or if she's just super insecure and controlling", "Have you asked her? I could hazard a guess that she wants your absolute attention and your mom represents a threat to that.", "She is literally insecure from my own mom!", "I mean, she constantly asks me to stop receiving calls whenever my mom calls me. Or ask mom to minimise the calls per week.\nIn all, GF feels like as my mom is single for decades and it's her fault that she never re-married or dated and because of that, she mooch off me emotionally.\nAnd I personally never felt in this way, I feel like GF just overreact.", "Do you find your mother's behavior intrusive?", "Intrusive as in? I've never felt like it. \nBut, my GF did. That's the issue!\nCan you personal DM me once? If you don't mind?"]}
