I love Dylan like he's my own and consider him as my son. He's a sweet little boy. Matt and his ex have 50/50 custody one week we\u2019ll have Dylan for 4 days while his mom has him for 3 and vice Versa. \n\nAbby\u2019s dad passed before she was born so she's with us full-time. Abby also was born with a chronic illness and she has a really weakened immune system because of it and is even does online/homeschooled. I know things happen and people get sick but when Abby gets sick she always ends up being hospitalized because of it. \n\nYesterday Dylan\u2019s mom called Matt letting us know he probably has the stomach flu because he's been throwing up and has a fever. Dylan hadn't been with us for 2 days at that point and when he left our house he seemed perfectly healthy. I ended up talking to Dylan\u2019s mom wondering if he could stay with her until he\u2019s better so Abby doesn't possibly get sick.\n\nDylan\u2019s mom knows about Abby\u2019s health but still insists Abby will be okay I can just quartine them both to their room until Dylan is better. That wouldn't be fair to either kid plus I would be around both of them and could possibly cross-contaminated to Abby. \n\nI asked Matt to talk to his Ex and he tried but she then accused Abby being favored over Dylan which isn't true Abby just has more needs health-wise. Dylan\u2019s mom then called me a AH and Matt is saying we should just try and have Dylan come back here.

I will say that you all need to come up with a long term plan bc Dylan will be getting sick again in the future.

And if Abby and Dylan were full siblings, then this will also happen where one picks up the sickness and gets passed on and you all would have to deal with it.\n\nOptions are Dylan and dad head to hotel or you and Abby head to hotel if you don't want them together, and option also available if they were full siblings", "NAH\nYour ask isn\u2019t unreasonable, but neither is her refusal. You made the choice to bring your daughter into a blended family with another child. You can\u2019t have the child\u2019s mother as your only alternate plan, that\u2019s not fair to her. The child\u2019s mother has a life built around co parenting. Speaking as a mother whose ex constantly had excuses to not take the kids, it\u2019s frustrating. I realize that your situation is different, but remember that she has a life with plans and commitments that are built around the coparenting plan. Both parents should have flexibility, but there may be times when that flexibility is impossible or highly inconvenient.", "Why is stepson in quotations???", "would you pack dylan off to a relatives if he was youur bio kid n got sick?", "NAH, it\u2019s a complex situation - can you get a hotel or stay somewhere else with your daughter", "INFO:\n\nIf you have a child who's immune system is so weak that they can't go to school why marry someone with a child?

What if Dylan didn't had a mother and was with you full time?\n\nDylan is a sick 8 year old little boy. What are people supposed to tell him so he doesn't feel guilty for being sick? So he doesn't feel like his father doesn't want him around his new family? \n\nAnd dylan's mom is not an AH for refusing. Yes she has help, but it's not because you have people to help that you can/should always count on them. Her parents might probably be old and the days without the kid must do them some good too. Maybe they can't help for 2 weeks straight because they get too tired. Maybe the mother has plans that she can't reschedule. Or maybe she believes that the custody agreement should be respected because it helps maintaining a healthy co-parenting relationship with the father. And healthy co-parenting leads to an happy kid. \n\nThis situation will happen again. Because he's 8, people get sick and specially kids. You won't always be able to shelter your daughter as much as you want to. I honestly believe that you should find a solution within your family (you/your daughter/your husband/your stepson) without involving others. Since you love the kid, when it's his time with his father, consider him as he was yours with no other place to go. And always remember that if a sick child needs attention, an healthy kid needs it too.", "I\u2019m not going to call you an AH. You are trying to protect your daughter and I get that, but it\u2019s a slippery slope. Dylan is 8 does he get why he can\u2019t stay with you? How does he feel about it? I\u2019m not doubting you love him and I understand trying to keep your daughter safe, but he\u2019s going to get sick and if you need him to leave your home every time he gets sick he\u2019s going to feel neglected. He\u2019s going to start to resent Abby and you could end up pushing him to want to live with his mom full time.", "YTA if Dylan\u2019s mother isn\u2019t available, then there would be no choice. Your husband has a responsibility to take care of his son. He doesn\u2019t get to pawn off that responsibility on his ex-wife.

Would your husband have to vacate the home every time he got sick? \n\nYou should take your daughter and check into a hotel.", "INFO. Are there any additional childcare expenses/arrangements that need to be made for Dylan if he stays with his mom on \u201cyour\u201d time ?   \n\nAdults have busy lives and looking after a sick child can take time away from work or other commitments.", "If matt has 50/50 custody, this is HIS problem, not his ex's.  Are you willing for Matt to pay more child support, if he cannot handle 50/50?", "NAH I can see it from both sides. However, do you keep Abby wrapped up tight in a bubble? Does she never go outside? Or shopping in malls? Cause I guarantee you that 1 out 4 people that she encounters is more than likely sick or been around someone that is sick.", "Yta.  If you had another child you would figure a way to deal with this.", "Soft yta, im going against the grain. I understand why you want your daughter to be safe. However when you married your husband you knew he had a kid. He is responsible for his child during his tine sick or not. \n\nInstead of asking the mom to take care of her sick son so more days off of work. Are you willing to pay for her time taken off to help you? You guys should have a plan where you and your daughter leave. Stay with family or a hotel.

Do you leave the house when you get a cold ? Does your husband have to move out if he gets sick ? \n\nYou need to figure out what the plan is going forward as kids get sick a lot , and you cannot expect his mother to take on extra custody days every time it happens", "Info: would your plan going forward that Dylan\u2019s mom keeps him every time he\u2019s sick?  I understand  where you\u2019re coming from and your want to keep your daughter safe. However I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that you expect his mom to shoulder the burden of taking care of the sick kid every time. It\u2019s a lot of work. You\u2019re making the assumption that it\u2019s not a big deal because she works from home and lives with her parents but you\u2019re still putting the work on them. You also mention you\u2019ve asked before and she said yes so she\u2019s probably mad because she sees it\u2019s becoming a pattern. For those two factors I have to go with YTA. Long term, you need to find a solution to keep the kids separate that doesn\u2019t involve Dad not taking his parenting time. Kids get sick all the time, this will keep happening and Dad needs to find a way to care for his sick kid.", "INFO: Will your husband be visiting his son while he is sick?\n\nI get that you want to protect your daughter and it is okay to ask him not to be at your place, but it's also not fair to ban him from contact with his Dad when sick. He is a child just like your daughter and has also needs that need to be considered.\n\nYour husband and his Dylans Mom have 50/50 custody, that means your home is Dylans home just the same. You can't ban a child from his home and parent every time it gets sick.", "If Dylan was both your bio kid you wouldn\u2019t send him away. You would make do with proper arrangement at home like normal nuclear family do.", "YTA for pretending like you love your stepson like he's your own when you clearly don't.", "So if you or your husband get sick , how do you deal with it ??? If you were to have another kid how will deal with them getting sick ? If for some reason your stepson has to live with you full time , what will you do ?  YTA", "NAH but i dont think its very fair that its solely her responsibility to take care of their kid whenever he gets sick", "If Dylan's mom's issue is rhat she has to work, could dad take off work instead and soend the day with Dylan at mom's house?", "Where are your parents to step up and help with Abby? Where are the father's parents? Why are you putting this all on Dylan's mother?", "NAH I grew up with a brother that had a super rare disease that compromised his immune system. Like only a few people get diagnosed with it a year and at the time most didn\u2019t live past eight or nine years old. My parents did a pretty good job of balancing his illness and not wanting him to get sick with the benefits of having a cohesive family.  Like I got pulled out of school anytime a classmate of mine had chickenpox or anything serious.  I just got packets of schoolwork to do at home. I can\u2019t imagine how crappy it would\u2019ve been to have been shipped off anytime we did get sick.  Even though technically, my other brother, and I could\u2019ve killed our youngest brother with whatever we brought home, we were never made to feel like our presence was unwelcome in our home because of it. \n\nThis all should\u2019ve been discussed and planned for way in advance of blending households. If you have a need for Dylan to not be at the house where your daughter resides when he\u2019s sick, you needed to have made this clear from the get-go and not wait until he is vomiting with a fever to spring this on all the other adults in the family/coparenting arrangement.", "ESH. \n\nMom shouldn\u2019t have to take care of a sick kid all the time because yours might catch it.\n\nDad sucks for not trying to come up with a solution. The solution is for dad to go to a hotel for his custody time.", "This situation sucks but unfortunately I think YTA. You probably don\u2019t love Dylan like your own unless you would actually ban a sick biological child from your home as well. Your husbands parental responsibilities are not paused due to his child\u2019s illness. Gloves, masks, limited direct contact & frequent cleaning should mitigate the risks as much as possible.", "YTA because millions of immunocompromised children have siblings and their parents figure out. You might need to work harder to keep your daughter safe but this is Dylan\u2019s home too. Turning him away from his own home every time he\u2019s sick isn\u2019t the solution. You will need to figure something out besides banning him from the house. It will be difficult but parenting is difficult.", "INFO: if you have another bio child and he/she is sick would you kick them out too?", "Have husband deal with his son and sleep in a different room and you take care of your daughter. That way you don\u2019t interact with son. Husband needs to miss work? Oh well. Sick child in the house", "There were times when arrangements needed to be in the custody agreement between me and an ex, it's really not an issue. The issue can be seen as a punishment for the little boy when he becomes ill, which it isn't and it isn't fair for him to be in a position to even think that. However, your daughter also has special need that need to be taken into consideration.\n\nSo, while little brother is ill, everyone masks up, wipe down everything with that microguard stuff that's supposed to last 24 or 48 hrs, and take the extra precautions that her dr recommends. I'm assuming you already have HEPA filters either in your central HVAC or in separate rooms, but have you thought of looking into a UV system as well? Honestly not sure how well they work, but I had looked into them when they first came out and was tempted but had to move suddenly and now, many years later, I don't have HVAC. \n\nOne question though, has anyone taken him to the dr to make sure he's only got a tummy virus? If not, do so. If it's more than a normal mild tummy bug then you all can adjust the plan accordingly. RSV has been running rampant the past few years and is nothing a kiddo needs to deal with. The flu is picking back up along with covid. Please make sure the little guy is checked and properly treated.\n\nI will also say this, it sounds as if hubby and his ex hasn't experienced the full effects of when your daughter becomes ill. The next time she does, and I'm sorry to say that no amount of prevention will keep her from it eventually, make sure that they both go the hospital and see exactly what happens. Too many people think that a hospital stay for a child is being surrounded by video games and toys, and don't understand that often it's multiple IV's, oxygen cannula if not full respirator, repeated tests, monitors hooked up and watched closely, and constant one word prayers of, \"*Please!\"\n\nHave you though of designating a \"recovery area\"? Consider it a sick room but comfier. That way anyone who does come down with something can still be comfortable, it doesn't come across as \"ewwww...germs!\" and it reduces the risk of ailments spreading. Also, you can set up video feeds so the kiddos can still play with each other.\n\nNAH here, everyone is just caught up in the situation and has forgotten to look for solutions instead of roadblocks. Oh, and here's an idea...invite Dylan's mom on a spa day, just the two of you. Bond over the trials and tribulations of motherhood, and let her know you don't consider her a glorified babysitter or a rival.", "INFO: What do you did when you are sick or your husband?", "YTA and I say this as a mom of an immunocompromised kid who was just in the hospital.  Difference is my husband and I have three kids all ours.  We don\u2019t ship our kids out when one gets sick; we quarantine and don\u2019t see each other a lot for a few days.  You\u2019re being incredibly selfish to expect the bio-mom to take care of the sick kid all the time.", "Soft YTA. Whilst I sympathise that your daughter gets really unwell when sick, what would you do if your stepson lived with you fulltime? At the end of the day, that\u2019s still his home and he doesn\u2019t deserve to be kicked out of his own home. I\u2019m saying this as someone who has a chronic health condition and a compromised immune system since a child. I lived with multiple siblings who spread their illness\u2019 to me and I was often hospitalised but what other choice did my parents have? People get sick often, you can\u2019t kick people out of their own home or have people leave the home to prevent this. It\u2019s not stable nor fair on either party. Again, I sympathise and I wish your daughter all the best with her health. Also, I wish you all the best as a parent to a child with a chronic health conditions - I know it was very hard on my mum both mentally and physically when I was sick and that is often overlooked as the focus is on the child\u2026 so look after yourself as well.", "YTA\n\nYou married a man with a child he has 50/50 custody. Expecting his ex wife to rearrange her schedule every time the child gets sick is not OK.  YOU and your husband need to come up with a plan to handle this as kids get sick all the time and expecting the ex wife to always be the one to flex is unreasonable.", "YTA - You say you love your step son like he was your own, but it seems like you only want him around when he isn't an inconvenience. I know that you have to protect your daughter, but what you are asking your husband to do is to prioritize your daughter over his son. I don't think you are horrible for what you are doing, but it is clear that you don't love Dylan like your own and you need to be honest with yourself about that. Would you stay somewhere else if you were sick? Would you kick your husband out of the house if he had the flu? What happens when she's an adult?", "Gently but YTA. You\u2019re asking her to take  on Dylan\u2019s illness not just this time but every time going forward which means that Matt does none of this care for his son. He should be telling you no. You married a man with a child even though you had a daughter with a weak immune system. This is now your & Matt\u2019s problem to resolve. Stop involving his ex in your issue. I understand that illness has significant repercussions for your daughter but you decided to bring her into this situation. You can\u2019t now say that you want Dylan banned from his house when he\u2019s ill. It kind of blows my mind that you could be this entitled.", "YTA. Dylan already switches houses twice a week. Try to disrupt him as little as possible. Kids get sick. He can\u2019t stay with mom as your backup plan. \n\nYou and Abby can go to a hotel. Dad and Dylan can go to a hotel. You can quarantine your home to keep Dylan and Abby apart for four days. \n\nWhat you can\u2019t do is routinely tell mom she\u2019s the backup for every moment Dylan is sick. \n\nMom has a life. Probably has a job. She may have worked the job around the custody.\n\n I know someone who schedules her three 12-hour nursing shifts on the three days her son is at dad\u2019s. She\u2019s an agency nurse, placed differently each week. Working the weekends brings a stipend that equates to a well-paid full time job. If she doesn\u2019t work a day, she loses 33% of her weekly income. \n\nChanges in her work schedule need advance notice and grace based on loss of income.", "NTA \n\nJesus Christ, asking to keep the kid a few extra days so that your daughter doesn't end up in the hospital is not a big ask. This is not favouritism, this is trying to keep a kid from getting very sick. This is utterly ridiculous. Your husband should absolutely be sticking up for the health of his step-daughter here!", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter has very specific health needs. You\u2019re right in that even if you quarantined them both, Abby would probably still get sick. And it\u2019s not fair to either kid to have to do that. It\u2019s better to just keep Dylan away from Abby until he isn\u2019t contagious anymore.\n\nI\u2019m sure Dylan\u2019s mom would want the same thing for him if he has the same issues as Abby. See if you can negotiate with her so it\u2019ll still be 50/50 (basically you keep him a little bit longer after he\u2019s feeling better) or something. \n\nDefinitely NTA, you\u2019re just looking after your daughter. Besides, Dylan would probably feel super guilty if he ever found out that he passed an illness to his step-sister that put her in the hospital.\n\nI think Dylan\u2019s mom might not understand the severity of having a weak immune system, too.", "NTA - is there anywhere else you can go with Abby for a few days?", "NAH. \n\nI get your wanting to be cautious...but you can't always send a sick child away every single time they get sick. What if something were to happen and Dylan were living at your house permanently? Would you find some family member to pawn him off onto when he's sick? Or if he WAS your child, what then? \n\nIt's of course understandable that you want to protect Abby, but Dylan has just as much a right to his father as Abby does. Which means, you all need to figure this out as adults \\[being the parents of course not the children\\], that will work because Abby will be exposed to other people. What if Dylan wasn't sick when he got there but gets sick during? Abby will have been exposed. The same goes for you and or husband. Both of you could become sick and then what? \n\nIt's not really reasonable to ask the mother to always have to take the kid whenever he's sick. I can also definitely see it causing resentment in the future, if it already hasn't, where the child feels like he is a burden or a harm to your family. \n\nYou married this man knowing he had a child...which you knew meant germs and sickness. That means you all have to come up with a solution that is best for everyone.", "getting a hotel room with full room service seems a lot cheaper than the hospital bills that the chronically ill immune suppressed child would have to go through", "Going to buck a bit of a trend and say YTA, you state that if your husband is sick he leaves the house, you don\u2019t say what you do. You say you love Dylan as though he was your own but when it becomes difficult your first thought is have nothing to do with him. I appreciate you have a daughter with medical needs and the consequences are extreme, which I would not wish on anyone and can only empathise with you on that one. Others have asked the question what if Dylan was in the same situation as your daughter, ie his other parent was not alive or indeed you and your husband had another child. In these equations the other child lives with you 100% the same way your daughter does, what would you do if they got sick? That is what you need to work out and enact with Dylan or indeed anyone else in the household when they become ill. \nWhilst it would be great if Dylan could stay with his mother and presumably he is loved, comfortable and well looked after whilst there so feels safe whilst ill it isn\u2019t always going to be possible and does seem harsh to me. Comes across to me as \u2018yes I love you as though you were my own and I won\u2019t treat you any differently\u2019 until he gets ill and then it becomes \u2018get away from me you unclean thing I don\u2019t want to know you, help you or comfort you as your illness is less important\u2019", "YTA - kind of. What would you do if Dylan was your bio child? Or if his Mom was passed away? He'd be with you full time. I am sure a couple days of quarantining is not going to hurt anyone.", "YTA - bring your daughter somewhere else if you are concerned, stop punishing your step son for being sick", "NTA. Your husband's ex is aware of your daughters' health, she should be more understanding of the situation. And your husband needs to stand his ground and not be such a pushover.", "If Dylan is sick - why is he moving anyway? Surely his mum would want to look after him??? I think that's weird.", "NTA\n\nBut also, it's fair to not want to set a precedent. You are being smart, but she also has a co-parent that she deserves to be able to rely on.\n\nIt's also a tough time of year and given everything, he will probably be getting sick repeatedly so you do need to figure out some protocols that aren't just send him to his mom's. \n\nDo you have other family members in the area that you and she or your partner and Dylan could go stay with? Ideally you and Abby since it's not really fair to bring a cold to another home.", "NTA\n\nYep, you have two kids, so you need to find a way for you all to cohabitate. But I guess I fall into the stereotype and maybe even a little judgy. But what kind of mother doesn't want their children with them until they are fully on the mend?", "NTA. This isn't just a stomach bug, this is potentially a severe response requiring hospitalization. I think it was fine for you to ask about Dylan staying with his Mom. She said no, so now you need to figure out what to do -- and not just this time but for future colds/flus/whatever.", "NTA. This is about a child's safety, not about playing favourites.\nAs other suggested time to pack for a little mom& daughter vacation. If not an hotel go visit your family or friends.", "NTA I'm a big believer of sick folks staying where they are and not just intentionally letting everyone get sick. just keep it in your home FFS", "First off NAH, except maybe the ex. But it\u2019s hard to know, she may have legitimate reasons she can\u2019t keep her son. Unfortunately, your husband has an obligation to have his son for his custody time. That includes whenever he is sick. \n\nThe two (three?)of you need to work together to come up with a solution in these situations.\n\nFirst option, your husband and his son stay at a hotel. Or you and your daughter do.\n\nAlternatively, this time, the stomach \u2018flu\u2019 isn\u2019t a flu at all. They are normally caused by a novo virus. The good news about this is, novo virus is spread by direct contact, not droplet or airborne. So, with this option, your stepson stays in his room, which shouldn\u2019t be a problem if he is sick, and your husband alone tends to him and isolates away from you and your daughter. So he will probably have to sleep in his sons room. He will need to be careful with hand washing when getting meals etc (or if you want to be extra nice, you could provide meals) but as long as he stays away from you and your daughter, the risk is mitigated.\n\nNow, if your husband isn\u2019t willing to take the steps to keep your daughter safe in a reasonable manner (which I think the second option above IS reasonable for an immune compromised child) then you have a major husband problem and this changes to N T A with your husband being T A. Just \u2018toughing it out\u2019 and hoping your daughter doesn\u2019t get hospitalized isn\u2019t a viable option.\n\nHe can\u2019t expect you to care for his sick son.

He is sick and can prob tell that his parents are arguing over whether he is staying or going.", "Exactly NAH", "We have there is only so much we can do, my husband has stayed with a close friend of his, since I usually take care of Abby we talk to her doctor to see what the best plan is same with everyone but it usually is a case by case scenario but both my husband and I don't get sick often she doesn't catch every illness around her but Abby and Dylan are close and if he's home they want to play and hang out together so it's easier for her to get sick if Dylan\u2019s been with us", "So when should the compromise be for mom who always has to deal with sickness because a kid that isn\u2019t even related to her ex might get sick? She should always have to take care of a sick kid because \u2026? Why is that only her responsibility?", "But a long term solution does need to be made here. Is Dylan expected to stay at his moms house every time he gets sick? Kids get sick a lot. What would they be doing if Dylan was OP's bio son and didn't have another parent to stay with every time he got sick? Are they going to a hotel every time this happens? \n\nAll 3 parents need to sit down and come up with a solution. I met a mom at the pediatric cardiologist office back when my son was little who was stressing about her school aged son bringing back germs to her immunocompromised toddler daughter. They ended up doing a modified quarantine but she wasn't happy with how that was going. They tried sending the older kid to a grandparent when he was sick but that caused some resentment. I am not sure what they ended up doing. I am not suggesting that a solution will be easy and maybe this works in the short term but a talk should be had about how to handle this when it comes up again.", "Bio dad choosing to get into a relationship with a person who has an immunocompromised kid does not absolve him of the time he needs to take care of his child. \n\nDad needs to be getting a hotel room for him and Dylan to stay in if his new wife won't let him honor his obligations.  Ex wife has ZERO obligation to rearrange her schedule to accommodate OP or her child.", "Hadn't thought of the hotel idea; good suggestion.", "Well during  spring when Dylan was sick last with just a cold I asked his mom if she would be willing to take him she said she didn't mind taking Dylan when he was sick \n\nIf she hadn't have I would have disaffected and kept both kids in different areas", "Or just keep both kids in their rooms while Dylan is sick.

I understand dad died, but did all connections to the family as well?", "It also wouldn\u2019t be fair for Dylan\u2019s mom to have to take care of him on her own every time he gets sick. It doesn\u2019t sound like she ever agreed to that. I\u2019m surprised that this issue wasn\u2019t worked about before OP and her husband got married.", "OP does need alternative plans for keeping her daughter from sick people. However, the refusal here is unreasonable. People need to stop moving between different groups of people when they know they are sick to minimize spread. Regardless of if someone in one of the groups has immune deficiency. The ex is definitely exposed, op and her household probably hasn\u2019t been. There is no real need to pass a sick person to a different location described here. You\u2019re just making a sick person go out unnecessarily and exposing others to the illness.", "Exactly, Dylan mother is entitled to a life that does not revolve around her coparents needs. Matt can find alternate care not his coparent or can exit the house or OP and Abby can exit the house", "OP, how often has this happened, that mom has had to take Dylan when he is sick? Do you send him back to her, or have her keep him each time?", "I mean Matt has it made, he now has an excuse to never care for his sick kid.", "That was my question too. \n\nMy nephew has a compromised immune system, when he and his siblings were younger, if one got sick, they quarantined in their room or were restricted to their level of the house. When C19 came around, whoever got sick, went to the cabin 20 minutes away (nephew and sibs are in their 20s). \n\nThe stomach flu is nasty and highly contagious, and I can't imagine Dylan wanting to pack up and change houses while feeling like crap. But this is something families deal with on an ongoing basis.", "I think that\u2019s kinda different. It\u2019s not just a random relative, it\u2019s his mom, who he does normally stay with half the time. And he\u2019s already there.\n\nA more equivalent comparison is this:\n\nAbby and Dylan are both her biological kids. Abby is immunocompromised. Dylan is not. However, OP is still divorced. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say that OP has 100% custody of Abby because it\u2019s healthier for her not to travel, but has split custody of Dylan with her ex-husband 50/50. Ex-husband also visits Abby sometimes. This is all agreed upon, everyone is happy.\n\nDylan is staying with his dad when he gets sick. Same scenario OP describes happens.\n\nIdk, it still seems reasonable to me. Having a sick kid around an immunocompromised kid is just a bad idea. It\u2019d be causing Abby to suffer when it could\u2019ve been prevented. And if the family lives where healthcare isn\u2019t covered, it\u2019d cost them A LOT of money, too", "She said her husband does stay with relatives if he gets sick. So yes. As they should. This is a serious health issue. It's not worth her daughter's life to make bio mom feel better. I doubt it's the kid who is the monster. I'm sure the kid is more empathetic than the bio mom as he actually cares for his sister.

He stays with his mom for a couple of extra days this week, and then he can stay with his dad for a couple of extra days next week to balance it out. It can still be the same number of days. Custody agreements have minor adjustments like this all the time, just because life happens in ways you can\u2019t always predict and schedule in advance. \n\nIf the stepson\u2019s mom needed to go out of town for work and he needed to stay with his dad for a few extra days because of it, that wouldn\u2019t mean their custody arrangement wasn\u2019t 50/50 anymore.", "Usually 50/50 custody works great between them we have done expectations for her where Dylan stays extra with us", "She already said they don't infect their child and stay with relatives and the non-infected parent stats home.", "This.

She may have said no this time because she has commitments, or had used up all her time off already, or because she's realised that this is going to be the expectation every time Dylan gets ill.\n\nOP isn't TA for wanting to protect her daughter but she is for having no plan for that other than expecting the ex to step in every time Dylan is ill. Which isn't even very effective given that when Dylan falls ill at OP's or is contagious before symptoms show, Abby will already have been exposed.", "So Dylan's mom gets days of cleaning up vomit and they get extra fun days? That's a raw deal for his mom!", "He actually has twice\u2026 of course not on purpose and we explain to Dylan that it isn't his fault Abby needs to go to the hospital  just that Abby\u2019s body can't fight off Illness the same way him or I or his dad can so when she gets sick she gets \u201cextra sick\u201d and the doctors at the hospital can make sure she gets better", "Ya no.

Her husband can go get a hotel.", "Stand what ground? They're asking for a favor, and Dylan's mom is entitled to say no. Yes, it would be nice if she were willing to accommodate (and it sounds as though she has been in the past), but she's not obligated to help and it's possible that she has her own very valid reasons for not saying yes this time.", "You don't think the grandparents might have some health issues? This is the mother's problem and there is another family I don't see being mentioned besides the father being dead.", "Mom's who have jobs and limited sick leave?", "The thing is that OP cannot just demand her husbands ex keep their child every time he is sick.  If that\u2019s the case then the ex should get full custody and child support since the father is no longer doing his custodial part.  \n\nNow yes in this instance since the sick child is already at his mothers - she should be willing to keep him there.  But it\u2019s not a long term solution and it isn\u2019t fair to the child to have to avoid his fathers house when he has a sniffle or flu or stomach bug.  \n\nThey really need to come up with a plan that keeps her daughter safe while also allowing his son to still have his time with his dad.   As the mother of a child who has compromised immunity due to kidney disease, I know it is hard but sometimes you have to figure out a way to make it work.

We ask, not tell her to keep them.  if she wont she wont.  its my time and my responsibility.", "The general knowledge that kids get sick a lot is one thing, but when you KNOW that one is sick that's something else. If he was feeling fine and happened to bring something over is totally different from you know he's got something pretty serious, he should stay put. Even aside from OP's kids medical issues (which is a perfectly valid reason to not want him to come!) How miserable is this kid going to be in the car? If he's vomiting he shouldn't be moved. His mom just doesn't want to deal with him while he's sick and doesn't care about OP's daughter's situation.", "But having a sick kid is much worse. Maybe she has to stay home from work.", "The comment I replied to said \"Maybe he'll learn to say 'No' next time\". Saying \"No\" isn't an option. Would it be nice if Dylan's mom were willing to accommodate OP? Absolutely. The fact that she's done so in the past, and is unwilling to do so now suggests there's probably more going on here than just Dylan's mom being a jerk. Maybe it's a work issue, maybe she's dealing with other stuff OP isn't aware of. Maybe favoritism actually is an issue (even if it isn't applicable here) and that resentment has built to the point where she's now unwilling to compromise. Maybe it's something else entirely. \n\nAnd yeah, the dad should be doing more to facilitate a solution that protects the step daughter, but my comment doesn't suggest he shouldn't. I'm saying that OP expecting biomom to keep Dylan every time he's sick can't be the solution to this situation.", "The mom did keep Dylan last time he was sick. \n\nIt doesn't seem fair that it falls on her everytime considering Dylan also has a dad.\n\nI don't know what the perfect solution is, but putting all responsability on the mum is far from it.", "Solutions def could be worked in, like we keep Dylan longer next week or give mom an extra weekend off. OP's husband def dropped the ball.", "I wish I could upvote this more!", "from a stomach bug?  i could see a kid having cystic fibrosis and the other kid being sick with covid or the flu. that makes sense... but a stomach virus ending you up in the hospital seems a stretch imo..", "Where would she send her bio son if he was sick and didn't have another parent?", "So that means that poor Dylan won\u2019t be able to see his dad because he\u2019s going to be sick a lot what is the solution.

The potential outcomes are *wildly* disparate from one another.\n\nTo say forcing that risk on OP and daughter is \"fair\" is to take a wildly \"normalcy-centered\" viewpoint of the world.

And the hotel room walls are generally thicker than a home so if the person in the other room has an illness you\u2019re not as likely to get it. And quarantining in a hotel room is going to be way more of an adventure for a young child than needing to quarantine in her bedroom because her sick brother could kill her.", "yes people suggesting you take an immunocompromised kid to a hotel should really invest in a black light the next time they stay in one. They will never say such nonsense again.", "I agree, he needs to find a solution so he can care for his sick child during parenting time...

You can't just dump all the responsibility on one parent.", "Nope. Not how custody or parenting works. You\u2019re supposed to co parent which means making the best and safest choices for the children involved.

Dad can go to a hotel with Dylan and get away from the vulnerable kid instead of expecting mom to accommodate the healthy kid at the expense of the sick one! So the question of \"what would she do if Dylan was her kid\" is still irrelevant", "OP said they stay somewhere else other than the house when they get sick to avoid exposing Abby. So the dad is already used to this deal. No excuse.", ">This is just becoming a pattern OP refuses to address.\n\nNo.  This is a pattern the Dad refuses to address.", "Fair enough.\n\nAs always, take advice from reddit with a truckload of salt.", "It a germ fest there.", "Except OP implies that she has sent Dylan back to his mom's house when he's been sick before.", "Exactly!

The kids are always sick with something. This will work for now but isn\u2019t a longterm solution. My heart goes out to OP because it is a difficult situation. We are fortunate that none of our kids are immunocompromised.", "Saying \u201cno\u201d would likely have been an option for OP\u2019s husband if it were his *own* daughter in this situation. Whilst the ex has a right to refuse, in such an emergency OP\u2019s husband also has a right to say \u201cno\u201d to accepting his step-daughter\u2019s life being put at risk. He could have put his foot down instead of immediately backing down and expecting OP and her chronically ill daughter to be the ones who compromise with her LIFE. He should have made it very clear to his ex that they will UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES accept Dylan back in the house whilst he is sick and posing a risk to OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s life. I think we can reasonably assume that if it were *his* daughter, he wouldn\u2019t have just accepted his ex\u2019s \u201cno\u201d, and would have put up one hell of a fight which could have led to his ex accepting to keep Dylan. As far as we know, the *only* reason she isn\u2019t is because of \u201cfavouritism\u201d, not because she is unable. Which means, if OP\u2019s husband had actually stood up to her and said \u201cno\u201d to her pettiness, he might have been able to change her mind. But he didn\u2019t really press the issue. *That\u2019s* the problem. He doesn\u2019t seem to be taking this very seriously.\n\nAnd expecting biomum to keep Dylan with her every time he\u2019s sick can *absolutely* be an option when it concerns the health and life of another child. Is it an inconvenience? Yes. But he\u2019s *her* son. The onus is on her and her (edit: ex) husband to accommodate for Dylan when necessary. And if she is unable to, she can absolutely try to sort out alternative arrangements for her own son. If they didn\u2019t have 50/50 custody, she would have had to be with Dylan every time he\u2019s sick anyway, because he\u2019s *her* son.\n\nYes, the situation sucks, but it also sucks for the poor little girl who\u2019s health is so frail that her quality of life is already so limited. The solution is not to trap her in her room and limit her further, when she is already suffering so much. So yes, OP\u2019s husband shouldn\u2019t just passively accept a \u201cno\u201d from his ex for her to look after her *own* child unless she is absolutely unable to.

It's definitely not easy, and keeping both kids safe will require a lot of work on the part of OP and her husband, but Dylan is part of their family too.

When her fever spiked to 103, her dad, his girlfriend, and I all took her to the ER (she'd had a febrile seizure as a baby at around the same temp, so I wasn't risking it!)\n\nTurned out there was an epidemic of Coxsackie virus (hand, foot, and mouth disease) going around the region, and there wasn't really anything they could even do about it besides Tylenol and Motrin, and try to keep the kids comfortable.\n\nSo my ex and I decided that I would keep the sick one, and he'd take her older sister until she was doing better. He had her all weekend, and then he or his girlfriend to come to my house at drop-off every day and get her off the bus, then take her home across town.\n\nWell...every day for the first half of the week...and then the older one spiked a fever too, and for a sore throat with spots. So we knew she'd come down with it too... Which meant I now had *two* sick kids to deal with. Thankfully the older one didn't get hit as hard as her sister, but it was still rough.\n\n(Funny enough, this happened just after the kids went back to school, so my daughter had only had two days in second grade before she was out for a week straight.

The plan can be \"Dad and Dylan stay with extended family\", \"Dad and Dylan stay at a hotel\", \"Working with Abby's doctors to devise a safe quarantine plan\", \"paying for a sitter to stay with Dylan at Mom's house, so mom doesn't have to miss work\" or any other option they come up with.
