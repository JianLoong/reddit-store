They tested me to make sure I didn\u2019t have a medical issue because it was so freaky, but turns out nothing is wrong.  I\u2019m just really tall and built.  I\u2019ve been teased about it my whole life but I like it now. My parents do not. They worry about me not fitting in and they get really upset when people confuse me for a boy (which happened a lot before boobs). So, my mom has always had me wear really obviously girly clothes, I have to keep long hair, and they\u2019ve always pushed me towards really girly things. I think they\u2019re afraid I might be trans or at least people will treat me badly thinking that I am. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s always been more trouble to not go along with it.\n\nI started working out over the last year and I really like weight lifting. I must have good genes for it, because I\u2019ve made a lot of progress. The problem is that my muscles are bulking enough to be noticeable now and my parents think it\u2019s going to get me bullied for being too masculine, so they said I have to stop. My mom suggested jogging or yoga instead. I\u2019m going to yoga, but I miss my weight workouts. So, I asked the coach that teaches my health class if I could come in early and use the school\u2019s weight room. I\u2019ve been doing that for a month, but my parents found out about it this week from one of my teachers. They said I disobeyed them and went behind their back and I\u2019m grounded. I said it was really stupid that I can\u2019t workout the way that I like and they can\u2019t stop me. My mom said I\u2019ll thank them when I want to start dating. I\u2019m doing pushups out of spite and my dad says that it\u2019s good that I want to exercise but I\u2019m being disrespectful.", "created_utc": 1679667586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120lrkf/aita_for_continuing_to_weight_train_even_though/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents are being the AHs here even though they probably mean well. Do what you love it's your body and it's not hurting you or anyone.", "NTA, and as far as dating, there's guys or girls out there that like every body type.  I'm a 6'1 woman and never had a problem finding dates. Keep doing what you love!", "NTA\n\nFollow your passions.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My mom said I\u2019ll thank them when I want to start dating.\n\nThat's YOUR problem, not your family's, especially if all they're concerned about is how other people will see you.\n\nMost parents don't discourage exercise, they PUSH it. Weight training is awesome, and you can throw that 15-pound dumbbell at whoever tells you otherwise.", "NTA.  As far as I've read, the ONLY people giving you any grief over this is your parents. You like doing something both healthy and productive. Their issue seems to be of how that will reflect on them, based of whatever values. Good for you for starting and sticking to it. All the best.", "NTA. The idea that to be attractive to a man you have to be petite and smaller than him is both deeply misogynistic and low-key threatening. Why can men only be attracted to women they could physically overpower?", "NTA. It's not hurting anyone outside of your parent myopic view of the world.", "NTA - sounds like you are already mentally strong (and physically lol) enough to handle any bullying that might happen because of your muscles. I don\u2019t really see that happening though because being muscular as a woman is \u201cin\u201d right now. \nI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re mom would want you to conform to a more feminine look that you don\u2019t care about having. The dating comment is just false. There\u2019s so many guys that want a strong female and it isn\u2019t really the point. You\u2019re going to the gym for you and what makes you feel good, not for anybody else.", "NTA- You are old enough to start figuring yourself out. Your parents are pushing an Ideal on you that is frankly outdated. If you are happy weight training then they should be more supportive. Plenty of women are professional weight lifters and are able to date just fine. I would think you would want to date someone that was supportive of your hobbies and your desired body type.", "NTA look up calisthenics since your parents are restricting gym access. \nGood on your for pursing your passions and being comfortable in your own body. Do keep it healthy and fun!", "NTA\nDon\u2019t let you parents gendered expecrarions limit your happiness, if weight lifting makes you happy and doesn\u2019t hurt anything bit their own insecurities, then do it. Life is too short to stop being passionate about something because someone else doesn\u2019t like it. Good luck!", "NTA", "NTA. Your parents are being hella controlling. Working out is good for you and so is lifting weights. Seems they both have some internalized homophobia. Being worried others may think you\u2019re gay or trans is bizarre. To forbid you to lift weights when you clearly enjoy it and are good at it is ridiculous. Show them some Olympic female weightlifters. You can\u2019t help how you were created or what you enjoy doing. They\u2019re going to cause resentment.", "NTA", "NTA. They don't seem to accept you for who you are. And that's a bummer. What they don't seem to realize is that most people don't tease people who lift because 1) they look scary (cause they're ripped) and are stronger than most (and thus could easily hurt most people, even if they are not violent) and 2) it can help create confidence. So that is a lame excuse. They seem to want you to fit in to how THEY think a person your age should act and behave. \n\nLet's face it, you're different. And isn't that awesome? One option might be to sit down and have a conversation to both educate them and to talk about you (and your future). It might require several conversations. \n\nOne thing I might add - make sure to talk to someone who is experienced in weight training for women your age. You are still growing and eating and training in a healthy way are really important. You don't want to do something now that will affect you for the rest of your life.", "NTA It\u2019s your body and your decision. Sounds like they\u2019re putting your future dating prospects over your own feelings.", "Nta. Working in a gym environment you wouldn't believe how many women we have using the weights area. It's your workout. You keep at it.", "NTA\n\nYour parents, escpecially your mother may have serious issues with her body. You can't change her, but you also don't have to live with HER trauma. So stand up for your rights to train. Try to talk with her about it, e.g. if you want to date and your muscles make it hard, you can change your lifestyle THEN. And that she doesn't necessarily have to find your body attractive, it's you, who has to like it (and live with it). \n\nI wish you to find an honest way to train!", "NTA, if your dad doesn't want you to be \"disrespectful\" maybe he and your mom should try actually deserving your respect\n\nsorry your teacher snitched on you, have you considered lifting people instead of weights tho? wrestling and brazilian jiu-jitsu can be really fun", "NTA. It's great that you found something that you enjoy doing and that makes you feel good about yourself. Your parents' concerns may come from a good place, but ultimately it's your body and your choice how you want to exercise and take care of yourself. As long as you're doing it safely and responsibly, you shouldn't have to give it up because of their opinions. It's also not fair for them to force you into gender roles and make you conform to societal expectations. Keep doing what you love and standing up for yourself.", "Absolutely NTA. Heaven forbid a young teenager start some early healthy habits!", "NTA. And also it's really refreshing for once to read a post from a 16 yr old who is so level headed and mature despite the challenges you've faced. your parents should be proud of you for how you've handled a situation that would break many others, not trying to shame you for it.", "NTA \nYour parents need a wake up call. They should be proud of you for your success. You have obvious natural talent and you should use it if it makes you happy. We need more strong women in this world and believe me there are plenty of guys out there who are attracted to muscle. I also know quite a few female body builders who do pretty well in the dating and relationship areas of their lives, so don\u2019t let your parents outdated views make you worry about that.\n\nAlso, I doubt you will be bullied more for it. I mean who wants to bully someone with all that muscle? \nIf people try I bet they just back off if you tell them to.", "NTA. It's your body.", "NTA. Gaining muscles isn't like getting tattoos. It's not like one you get them, they'll never go away. If for whatever reason you want to get rid of your muscles in the future, all that you would need to do is stop working out for a couple of months.\n\nWhat I think your parents are actually worried about is that you'll want to keep working out as an adult and won't want to get rid of your muscles, and so they are hoping to squash that interest.", "NTA and wtf. As a female weight lifter myself, keep at it! It's amazing to feels strong. And if it comes to dating, believe me, the right people will find you sexy as hell.", "NTA - muscles look great on a woman.    I really liked when Madonna had buff arms.    Plus weight lifting is so good for people.    Your parents are being controlling and unfair.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA, you might want to consider therapy with your parents. I don't doubt that they love you but they sure seem to want you to be something other than what you are. You sound like you love yourself like that (which is amazing at 16, teen years are hard AF if you're different in any way, and you're awesome for it), now they need to do the same. Forcing you out of things you love and into things you don't is only going to make your relationship with them strained.", "NTA your parents are small minded people who while being well intentioned are wrong. Go get swole kid", "NTA.   \n\n\nWeight training is fun, and it's great to be tall and strong.  \n\n\nBest wishes with your training, and someday you will meet someone who loves you for being YOU.   \n\n\n(An Olympic weightlifter said her standard riposte to rude people who ask her if she doesn't have trouble getting dates, is to say that any man who's put off by her muscles is a man she wouldn't want to have anything to do with anyway.)", "Not only that but they are encouraging her to change who she is for the purpose of dating/having a significant other. That's a horrible lesson to teach any person.", "I hope OP cuts her parents out of her life when she's 18."]}
