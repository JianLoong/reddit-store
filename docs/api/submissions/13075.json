They tested me to make sure I didn\u2019t have a medical issue because it was so freaky, but turns out nothing is wrong.  I\u2019m just really tall and built.  I\u2019ve been teased about it my whole life but I like it now. My parents do not. They worry about me not fitting in and they get really upset when people confuse me for a boy (which happened a lot before boobs). So, my mom has always had me wear really obviously girly clothes, I have to keep long hair, and they\u2019ve always pushed me towards really girly things. I think they\u2019re afraid I might be trans or at least people will treat me badly thinking that I am. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s always been more trouble to not go along with it.\n\nI started working out over the last year and I really like weight lifting. I must have good genes for it, because I\u2019ve made a lot of progress. The problem is that my muscles are bulking enough to be noticeable now and my parents think it\u2019s going to get me bullied for being too masculine, so they said I have to stop. My mom suggested jogging or yoga instead. I\u2019m going to yoga, but I miss my weight workouts. So, I asked the coach that teaches my health class if I could come in early and use the school\u2019s weight room. I\u2019ve been doing that for a month, but my parents found out about it this week from one of my teachers. They said I disobeyed them and went behind their back and I\u2019m grounded. I said it was really stupid that I can\u2019t workout the way that I like and they can\u2019t stop me. My mom said I\u2019ll thank them when I want to start dating. I\u2019m doing pushups out of spite and my dad says that it\u2019s good that I want to exercise but I\u2019m being disrespectful.", "created_utc": 1679667586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120lrkf/aita_for_continuing_to_weight_train_even_though/", "score": 2129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here\u2019s something to perhaps help you with your parents. I have great muscles in my chest. So my breasts were muscle instead of fat, so when I lost weight I didn\u2019t lose my breast size.

I looked good in whatever I wore-covering up my body or of course when I wanted my breasts stick out, something that nit every girl wants which is perfectly acceptable. Unless you\u2019re looking to be a female body builder whose bodies look like man\u2019s body, it will actually keep you nice defined at your current size.

They breast fed often up to a year each child and still once they were done having kids, that part never sagged. At some point in life that will be important to you, not necessarily for sex appeal but for personal confidence. And maintaining your chest muscles will keep your personal confidence up because you will look good in whatever you choose to wear. At your age personal confidence is what you should be striving for. While I sought to hide my chest until I was in my mid twenties, I also had the advantage of my personal confidence. As other women complained about losing their bust size, I could proudly say I lost more weight than them and never lost a single cup size. Hopefully it will give you an advantage with your parents.

It also reduces the risk of heart disease and diabetes, reduces stress and assists with emotional health. Strength training and core muscle development helps you avoid back pain into adulthood and ensures that you will recover more readily from injuries.\n\nIf you're concerned about looking bulky (even if only while you still live under your parents' roof), you can speak with a trainer about the types of weight lifting exercises that create strength without creating the bulk so you can still enjoy this activity that clearly makes you happy and healthy while navigating your parents' issues (as unfounded and potentially problematic as they may be). If you have a regular physician, you could also discuss these issues with them and they may be able to help convince your parents that your attention to your physical health is of enormous importance to your well being and that there is no real basis for their concerns, which ultimately promote an unhealthy approach to your overall health and wellness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for typo.", "It sounds like your parents are transphobic and overly controlling.

I used to love to run and developed knee problems.  My dr told me to strengthen my legs with weights and I stopped having knee problems after a few months of doing so.  Developing core strength (abs and glutes) will help protect your back too.  \n\nAnd having muscle mass keeps your metabolism strong.  Fat doesn't burn calories but muscle does - even when you're sleeping or resting.  Weight lifting also builds stamina and helps you to do the things we all need to do - carry groceries, climb stairs, wear a backpack etc.  \n\nI could go on forever but, doctors suggest weight bearing exercise to protect you from bone loss later in life.  Weight bearing can be anything like walking, yoga, strength training, etc.  You need strong bones!  When a person starts losing bone density, they are more likely to break hips and other bones.  \n\nSome members of my family were very negative when I started running and weight training too.  It was fine to go to jazzercise (I don't know if that's still a thing) but running and weight lifting was not \"lady like\" according to them.  They also told me I'd bulk up and look like a man.  Personally, I never cared if I'm lady like or not.  I sweat, burp, fart and can lift my bodyweight and I'm a person while I do it.  Coincidentally, I have been told that I'm very feminine in appearance and behavior by other people, whatever that means, in spite of my outrageous muscle building and other endorphin seeking behaviors.  I do have visible muscles, I am not bulky in spite of lifting heavy and eating protein for many years.  I know a lot of women that lift and bulking up is actually very hard to do.  \n\nI don't know what to tell you about your parents.  They are factually and morally incorrect.  If the \"worst\" thing you do as a teenager is lift weights, your parents should be very proud.  I'm sorry you have been grounded.  Just remember that you only have 2 more years and then you can do what you want to do.  \n\nNTA.\n\nPS:  I never had any problems dating.  The only reason I was ever single was because I wanted to be.  Maybe some men were turned off by my 4 pack and peach, but they weren't the ones I wanted anyway.", "NTA, though it was disrespectful and disobedient. Exercise is moderately helpful to every single aspect of your life. If you don't want to bulk up, you can do lower weights at higher repetitions.

Or just keep working out and enjoy the food.", "Everyone covered a lot of why your parents are TA, but let's talk strategy. \n\nDo you think presenting your parents with a list of research literature on the positive benefits of weight training?

Every parent wants their kid to obey, but sometimes they aren\u2019t looking out for your best interests. You keep lifting if it makes you happy. There are always going to be people who make fun of you or won\u2019t want to date you, no matter what you choose. I mean people tear apart supermodel\u2019s looks and they get cheated on too. You are making a good and healthy choice", "NTA at all.  Your parents are being downright controlling and WIERD about it.  These are ridiculous rules being put on you for silly reasons.  They're basically bullying you because  you're not petite.  It's absurd.  I think you should talk to a counselor at your school about this.\n\nNo more accepting \"it's disrespectful\" on this.  You're not.  You may be their kid but you are not their possession.  You're a person, and  you have every right to exist as you are, and work out the way you please (in healthy ways, not this 1950's \"you have to be a petite little thing to catch a man\" nonsense).", "NTA just tell them \"I like to think that if I keep weight training any potential bullies will be too scared to say shit\"", "NTA, your parents sound insane tbh. Do they think they can control your body's natural patterns? If they yell enough, maybe you'll get shorter too? What a bunch of bullies. Also, I'm jealous of your body's natural strengths. Every time I try to put on muscle and compare the before and after, nada. Too bad your parents don't understand that your unique qualities are an incredible strength and something you could really build on for your future, and not something they should try to suppress...", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are being weird and controlling. In good news, you can move out in 2 years.", "NTA. As for what your mom said about dating, if it's something you want it's something you can do. This idea that you have to look a certain way for someone to be attracted to you is simply false. There's people out there who find how you naturally look incredibly attractive and if you want to find them you can. You do you. I wish I had learned by your age to accept myself as I am, it would have saved me a lot of heartache.", "OP should start smoking or even better, taking meth. Makes you skinny in a heartbeat. /s\n\nObviously NTA.", "For the love of god please get into jiu jitsu or MMA!", "Nta women bodybuilders are a thing lol.  There is nothing wrong with being built like a valkyrie. Strong feminine women are beautiful. They are probably pushing you to want to cut your hair and dress differently just to spite them. Be yourself and proud of who you are.", "NTA\n\nthose poor parents are probably sincere in wanting the best for their child and they don\u2019t realize how ridiculous they are. Grounding a teenager for lifting weights is bonkers.", "NTA. You\u2019re parents need to let you do what you want. Some people do not want to work out and you do and they must support you. \n\nWhy does it matter if you are bulky? If you enjoy it and you\u2019re happy with your body that\u2019s the only thing that matters. \n\nSit down with them and just explain how unhealthy it is the way they are acting. Start with a question like \u201cwhat do you want me to be?\u201d Do you want me to be happy and healthy?\u201d They will say yes and explain why weight lifting is important to you and why you believe you should continue to do so. \nGood luck", "\"You can't do that because your future hypothetical boyfriend might not like it!\"\n\nNTA. And for the record, if you DO get bullied, you can shut that shit down real fast. AND lots of guys would love to be with someone that could bench press them. The hot ones, in fact. Y'all would be such a power couple dominating the gym every day, if that's what you decide you want.\n\nNTA.", "NTA! In the slightest! You should be free to do what makes you happy and there is also an obvious health benefit in lifting heavy things and putting them back down again. Your parents, whilst seemingly well intentioned, are somewhat closed minded.", "NTA. Wow, your parents suck! I'm glad you'll soon be out of their house and can enjoy YOUR body without having to live with their hassling! Stay your wonderful self.", "NTA. Tell them to embrace your giant Viking warrior woman self or you'll have to go all Valkyrie on their hinders!", "The next time your parents give you grief, say one thing - Gwendoline Christie. She is a gorgeous amazon of a woman, six feet tall, and during her reign as Brienne of Tarth, was formidable. She is an actress and model, successful, and is married. Your parents are trying to corral you into an ideal of beauty and behavior that does not apply to you. You keep doing you! When you hit 18, keep doing you, even if you have to move out to get away from your parents to do it. You create your path, not others! And not ALL males are so incredibly shallow that they wouldn\u2019t date you. NTA!", "NTA and your parents suck at parenting", "Do your weights and flex on your parents", "NTA and when you start dating you\u2019ll find someone who likes you for who you are and what you look like.

I would think having that muscle would keep you from being bullied.", "NTA.\n\nI think your parents are probably well intentioned but it seems like they still have ideas from when they were in high school. If you're not concerned about how other people will treat you, then they shouldn't either.\n\nHonestly if the biggest thing they have to worry about their teenage daughter doing is exercising, they have it pretty good. You might want to mention that to them. Most parents don't have the luxury of finding out their kid is working out behind their back, usually when kids sneak around it's a lot worse.\n\nGood for you for finding something you enjoy and sticking with it.", "NTA. \n\nWeight training is fun; I like it too, although don't really get bulky muscles.   Your body belongs to you and it's rotten your parents don't respect that.  IMO, they are the disrespectful ones!", "NTA. Girl you do you. If weight lifting makes you happy, then do that. It's a great stress release, among other things. Good news: if you go to college most of them have a gym or a weight class you can take, and if you don't go you'll be old enough to get your own gym membership. \n\nHave you seen female bodybuilders? I have friends that are and while yeah some are super jacked... Guess what? They are also happily married, or have a partner. You being more bulky or defined does not make you undesirable as a partner or define your sexuality.", "I just pictured Luisa from Encanto. What a queen. Your parents are transphobes. Lifting weights can't change your gender. NTA", "NTA, and this is so weird. Reeks of transphobia and misogyny and I'm sure the parents will be like \"oh no NO we're not like that at all\"\n\nWomen SHOULD be lifting weights. This is proven. We need it to retain muscle mass as we get older. Jogging (which is cardio) and yoga do NOT do the same things at all. It's usually done a little differently for women (less weights more mass) but that would be a question for someone informed, like your coach, as to what is the best training program for your body type. If they ground you from the gym, you can get a pretty effective body workout using no weights (just squats, pushups, and crunches together hit just about every muscle group).\n\nAlso, I gotta say, weight lifting for ME makes my boobies bigger (comes from building pec muscles).  \n\n\nEDIT: just wanted to tell you I was on the border about doing my weights today and now I totally am going to do it, thanks for encouraging me!", "Eh. Take up smoking and drugs. See if that\u2019s better than doing something that strengthens your body and brings you better overall health.\n\nKidding, please don\u2019t so that.  Your parents are the AH\u2019s here. Keep being you, your authentic self. Many people don\u2019t find that kind of passion in their lifetime, much less by high school.  And tell them some almost 50 year old woman said relationships are overrated if you need to change who you are to \u201cget them to like you.\u201d  They don\u2019t like you at that point, they like a costume. I wish someone would have told me that when I was your age!!", "NTA\n\nBody weight training is a great alternative if you can't use the weight room. However, at 16yo, it also wouldn't hurt to have it on record with the school that this is going on just in case there's escalation.", "NTA.\n\nYou do you. Your parents need to deal with their own insecurities on their own. Not once did you mention anyone bullying you over how you look OTHER than your parents.

Weight training is great for keeping body fat at bay and promotes great discipline.  Running and yoga are fine, but strength training is far more beneficial.  Ask your health teacher to help you find some resources to show your parents strength trainings benefits.  I would stop calling it weight training and call it strength training.  They are connotations it as a men\u2019s sport.  There are significant amounts of women that strength train\u2026many more than even 5-10 years ago.", "NTA.", "This is indeed ridiculous.

That\u2019s not okay.", "AND they're teaching her that her body isn't really her own, and treating her like their possession instead of like a person. NTA, OP. Get strong! Be like Luisa! Learn to carry a herd of donkeys all stacked on top of each other! Be careful though.

Such an ignorant comment from your mother.", "It seems like the parents are trying to have their child not be bullied because they have an antiquated point of view. Like I said, they are wrong and likely would benefit from a fairly stern conversation of why that is but do you really think their goal is to terrorize and bully their own child?", "With words. Surely this isn\u2019t something that can\u2019t be overcome. Try to look at this from beyond your own perspective. Nothing has been done yet that can\u2019t be fixed.", "I am always in pain when walking but that's because my left leg hates me and does everything in its power to cripple me at bad times.\n\nBut yeah if I see someone with large breasts have to bend over to pick something up I internally cringe a little as my back starts hurting just watching it.", "Also when you have to lay on your stomach for anything. My physio has me lay on my stomach to check my glute/thigh strength, and I'm like \"wait, gotta adjust the tatas\" lol \n\nThe other day I released a leg press too fast and kneed myself smack in the nipple. I almost dropped the f bomb. lol My 'gym' is actually at the hospital, so not really a gym that you would feel comfortable doing that. lol", "Yeah like I said nobody is perfect. Her mom was probably taught these values from her mom he learned it from her mom. It was a completely different environment for women for the mother growing up then the daughter.

That's all we have.  And she describes parents that have been bullying her about her looks for a long time.  They don't want to \"talk about\" her weight training.
