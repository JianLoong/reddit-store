They tested me to make sure I didn\u2019t have a medical issue because it was so freaky, but turns out nothing is wrong.  I\u2019m just really tall and built.  I\u2019ve been teased about it my whole life but I like it now. My parents do not. They worry about me not fitting in and they get really upset when people confuse me for a boy (which happened a lot before boobs). So, my mom has always had me wear really obviously girly clothes, I have to keep long hair, and they\u2019ve always pushed me towards really girly things. I think they\u2019re afraid I might be trans or at least people will treat me badly thinking that I am. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s always been more trouble to not go along with it.\n\nI started working out over the last year and I really like weight lifting. I must have good genes for it, because I\u2019ve made a lot of progress. The problem is that my muscles are bulking enough to be noticeable now and my parents think it\u2019s going to get me bullied for being too masculine, so they said I have to stop. My mom suggested jogging or yoga instead. I\u2019m going to yoga, but I miss my weight workouts. So, I asked the coach that teaches my health class if I could come in early and use the school\u2019s weight room. I\u2019ve been doing that for a month, but my parents found out about it this week from one of my teachers. They said I disobeyed them and went behind their back and I\u2019m grounded. I said it was really stupid that I can\u2019t workout the way that I like and they can\u2019t stop me. My mom said I\u2019ll thank them when I want to start dating. I\u2019m doing pushups out of spite and my dad says that it\u2019s good that I want to exercise but I\u2019m being disrespectful.", "created_utc": 1679667586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120lrkf/aita_for_continuing_to_weight_train_even_though/", "score": 599, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's impressive because I know it takes hard work and commitment and inspires me to work harder myself.", "Nta, your parents at jest are ignorant of the issues this is causing and actually are trying to care about you but going about it poorly.\n\nWorst case your parents are transphobes who would rather you be upset that the chance of people even trimming they gave birth to someone not cis and straight\n\n\nEither way it's their issue that they are going around poorly and in no way your fault for being born built", "NTA, you\u2019re a TEEN, you have bodily autonomy and can do whatever you want that isn\u2019t putting your life in danger. I was struggling with an ED at your age and a cardio/cycling bunny. do what makes YOU feel best, if that\u2019s masculine/feminine clothes, lifting weights, high protein, whatever the case may be. just make sure you\u2019re safe when doing so and not undereating like crazy as it can mess up your hormones and growth. I\u2019d be so happy if my kids want to lift someday (they\u2019re 3 so not for a while) but they love running/playing/horse chores/riding. it\u2019s healthy for kids/tweens/teens to have regular exercise as it sets them on a good bath for being healthy adults.", "NTA. Get super swole. Do a Luisa from Encanto cosplay. Win at life.", "NTA - Keep at it!", "NTA\n\nCannot wait until you exercise your freedom at 18 to do whatever the fuck you want. \n\nI hate the fact that in their efforts to make sure you're not bullied they've become your first bullies.\n\nThis isn't about you at all. It's about them and their inability to recognize how strong and healthy their daughter is. It's just sad on their part.", "Yeah exactly. It\u2019s her body and her dating life. Whenever she wants to date, the right person will love the way she looks because they love her. And who knows, it may be some cutie she meets at the gym", "Being physically strong and confident weeds out a certain kind of man, which is a great bonus.", "We've all seen Lean Beef Patties YouTube videos, and she's both amazing, majestic and gorgeous.", "Perfect answer. There was a girl in my class built exactly like op describes\u2026just tall and stacked. Iirc, she also took up weightlifting (b/c why wouldn\u2019t you if you\u2019re already stacked?) and welding. She was really good at both.\n\nAs someone on the opposite physical extreme (\u201cgo eat a cheeseburger\u201d thin): when your body is built well outside the usual expected averages, you\u2019re never *not* going to stand out. Might as well dress and do as you like.", "on what planet is telling your child they can't do activities they love bc they might get bullied coming from a good place? the only person bullying them is the parents! NTA OP", "[removed]", "Except for serial killing.", "Not well intentioned. They're shaming her for something she can't control and forcing her to adhere to stereotypical gender norms because they hate their daughter's body.", ">I will also add that it\u2019s immensely impressive that throughout this ordeal you have remained confident in who you are. It\u2019s rare to have the at type of self assurance as an adult, let alone as a teenager figuring everything out.\n\nTBH her parents probably think her confidence and self-assurance are a mark in the 'too mannish' column, too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so happy for OP. I'm short and medium-built, but I have never felt better than when my body was strong from weight training. It's amazing, but physically and mentally - something about lifting heavy stuff really gets the neurons vibing the right way.", "I LOVE Luisa!  I literally cried over her song and that someone who looks like me on TV isn\u2019t portrayed as bad.", "I think it's gross how much parents like these think about their children's attractiveness", "They are talking about small children, not teens. Teens have been strength training for years for things like football, volleyball, soccer, wrestling. Heck, our high school cheerleading team did strength training. Once a kid is old enough to follow the safety precautions even Mayo clinic says it's okay.", "[removed]", "and weight lifting is popular, plus it\u2019s the best way to tone/get a feminine shape (in a deficit) or get plenty of muscle or rid yourself of body fat even in a slight surplus", "There are plenty of people who would love to date a fit woman. \n\nRegardless, it's gross that the parents are preventing their daughter from working out because of concerns about her hypothetical future dating. They are prioritizing the preferences of her imaginary future partner over her own current interests. They view their own daughter as an object for the viewing of imaginary future people (probably just men). How disgusting.", "OP should look into this, the college scholarship angle would change the minds of a lot of parents", "Heck in some cases it's an advantage.\n\nThe \"buff Amazon mummy\" type is very real and people can chase that.", "[removed]", "Yeah ... I very vividly remember my mom telling me when I was a teenager that if I did pushups or anything involving my upper body muscles that it would make my boobs smaller. I was a 15yo with DDD cups so I really didn't see what was wrong with that outcome.", "I don't think their concerns come from a good place either... very \"Ew.. you're not being girly enough to catch yourself a GOOD HUSBAND\" vibes.", "Her parents sound like the kind of people who told Rosie the Riveter to go back to the kitchen.", "It sounds like all they care about is that she looks good and feminine for a man in the future.", "Not necessarily... the climate for a Trans person is toxic and dangerous right now. They could just be afraid their kid is going to be hurt/bullied/discriminated against etc. They could also be transphobic assholes, but nothing OP says really screams one way or the other. Either way, OP is NTA for doing her workout the way she wants.", "With this intense of opinions on gender representation and OP's body, I doubt very much that any therapist that the parents would a) find in the first place and b) agree to go to would more than likely be a source that wouldn't be helpful to OP and maybe even more harmful.\n\nI mean, do these people sound like the sort of people to change their opinions? Look, if your teenage kid's hobby is healthy and not dangerous (I guess unless they lift above their ability without a spotter?) you should be thanking your lucky stars. I was never in trouble but I did much worse than *secretive weight training.*\n\nInstead, they freak out and ground her because they're so disturbed by the fact their daughter looks \"too masculine\" and are terrified of people judging *them* if this hypothetical stranger judges OP. Then there's the whole \"they're worried someone will think I'm trans\" bit...\n\nThey actively warn against attending therapy with some types of people, as they can wind up reinforcing the fucked up behaviors of that party or if they agree with the wronged the therapy discontinues and the wronged may even be punished for what they shared during therapy. \n\n***People have to want to change to even agree to therapy, much less for anyone to see a benefit from it.***", "You're not my supervisor.", "That kind of seems like a pretty bad faith interpretation. It\u2019s generally better to assume ignorance over malice and is usually more accurate", "Luisa is amazing.  Muscles do not make a woman less beautiful or feminine at all. Strong women are wonderful.", "Agree! It's like they're caught in this weird 1950s time warp where a woman's value is determined by he attractiveness to men. They have no idea how damaging this is to their daughter!\n\nSick!", "I'm a woman and I love lifting weights", "This is a comment stealing bot.
