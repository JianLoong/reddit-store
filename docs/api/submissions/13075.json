They tested me to make sure I didn\u2019t have a medical issue because it was so freaky, but turns out nothing is wrong.  I\u2019m just really tall and built.  I\u2019ve been teased about it my whole life but I like it now. My parents do not. They worry about me not fitting in and they get really upset when people confuse me for a boy (which happened a lot before boobs). So, my mom has always had me wear really obviously girly clothes, I have to keep long hair, and they\u2019ve always pushed me towards really girly things. I think they\u2019re afraid I might be trans or at least people will treat me badly thinking that I am. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s always been more trouble to not go along with it.\n\nI started working out over the last year and I really like weight lifting. I must have good genes for it, because I\u2019ve made a lot of progress. The problem is that my muscles are bulking enough to be noticeable now and my parents think it\u2019s going to get me bullied for being too masculine, so they said I have to stop. My mom suggested jogging or yoga instead. I\u2019m going to yoga, but I miss my weight workouts. So, I asked the coach that teaches my health class if I could come in early and use the school\u2019s weight room. I\u2019ve been doing that for a month, but my parents found out about it this week from one of my teachers. They said I disobeyed them and went behind their back and I\u2019m grounded. I said it was really stupid that I can\u2019t workout the way that I like and they can\u2019t stop me. My mom said I\u2019ll thank them when I want to start dating. I\u2019m doing pushups out of spite and my dad says that it\u2019s good that I want to exercise but I\u2019m being disrespectful.", "created_utc": 1679667586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120lrkf/aita_for_continuing_to_weight_train_even_though/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
