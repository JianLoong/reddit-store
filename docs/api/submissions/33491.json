This was her plan from the beginning.", "Because it\u2019s their child don\u2019t be and obtuse misandrist.", "Baby names are a 2 yes decision.", "YTA \n\nYou stated you were ok with it when previously discussed and then you threw a big curve ball and also started a fight with your husband telling him All this crap that you yourself don\u2019t even believe like it\u2019s the patriarchy when you said in your comment that just life changed. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible that you didn\u2019t know this was so important to your husband and you are just not into the name and probably should have thought more on that before getting married.", "Here\u2019s the asshole part: that you are \u201cjust not feeling [it] anymore\u201d when \u201cit\u201d is something that is and has always been incredibly important to your husband. If you had entertained it before, then you haven\u2019t always been opposed to it, so I\u2019d have a hard time believing your feelings about it are comparably strong to his. \n\nSeparate from how people feel about Sr/Jr/III/IV names\u2026 it seems something that is very important to your husband for stated reasons is moderately undesirable for you for no real reason. \n\nNot to diminish your perspective or opinion about things in general, but for this specific instance it would seem to me that the scale is tipped in his favor. \n\nCould you compromise by technically naming him IV but you and husband come up with a nickname that is uniquely his and that he will be called exclusively? That way it carries on the tradition but not in a \u201cday to day\u201d way. Or you get majority voting for names for any future kids? \n\n(Personally I think Sr/Jr names are kinda dumb, but if it\u2019s made it all the way to III and now maybe IV ? That\u2019s a good run. I\u2019d have a hard time breaking it. It\u2019s like a thing now. Like in Friends when they are tossing the ball. Ya know?)", "\"Just life I guess\".\n\nSo drop the patriarchy excuse.", "If this is your stance, that since you are carrying the baby, you get to make all the decisions, you are going to destroy not only your relationship with your husband, but damage his relationship with the baby.\n\nThis child is both of yours, it is not yours alone. You need to learn how to compromise.", "You know thats his baby too right?", "No, he was led to believe he married someone that was on board with his wishes and now you are blindsiding him. \n\nI married a 4th and we discussed before marriage that if we had a son he wouldn\u2019t carry on the name. As we both believe in a baby having his individual name. If it had been important to my husband I would suggest we each go our separate ways since then.", "YTA. You went into it KNOWING if it was a son that he wanted to continue his family\u2019s tradition. How important it was to him! And you ok\u2019d it. \n\nNow that you\u2019re actually pregnant, you want to change your mind?! That\u2019s pretty assholey. I think both parents get a say and should come to an agreement. Normally.\n\nIn this instance you\u2019re being an ass, bc in his mind, you were ok with it prior bc you told him so. So no, you don\u2019t get to suddenly change your mind. Good to know he married a liar. Give him this and you can compromise on baby number 2.", "You can change your mind but you waited until the last minute to tell him. YTA.", "I was teetering back and forth, but YTA now. This was very important to him and you were fine with it up until now for, as you admit, no reason. My guess is you were never fine with it, lied, and always planned to steamroll him once pregnant with a boy. \u201cI\u2019m carrying the baby\u2026\u201d Poor husband is going to hear this the rest of his life anytime he has an opinion about the child. Tell your husband good luck. I\u2019m guessing co-parenting with you is going to be a nightmare.", "So you lied to him for years? Yes, YTA.", "No\u2026..just changing your mind is not a good enough reason to go back on something you\u2019ve agreed to/\u201centertained\u201d", "Except that isn\u2019t a compromise?", "It doesn't feel like you changed your mind. It feels like you never really considered it because it wasn't important to you. So you said maybe, but you didn't mean maybe earnestly. You didn't give it the thought it deserved before you got married and had kids. It was important to him so he took you at your word that it was a possibility that you gave a lot of thought to.", "And your husband also has a right to change his mind about being married to someone who committed fraud to him.", "You acknowledge that people don\u2019t always get their way\u2026so why can\u2019t that person be you in this situation? Why is it your husband who can\u2019t get his way? I get changing your mind and not loving the idea of the tradition anymore, but maybe you are the one who doesn\u2019t get their way this time given the fact that you are the one who is changing their mind about it.", "You are right, sometimes you don't always get what you want, in this, if you agreed to the name initially and understand the family ties with the name, then you don't get what you want now. YTA for changing your mind on something that is clearly quite important to your husband and sure, people change their minds, but that should have been discussed when that agreement became a disagreement. I think saying \"we don't always get what we want\" ONLY assuming it's your husband and his family that get to take this loss is not a life lesson, it's just selfish.", "And he is allowed to dump your flip floppy ass after you name your kid Breighdan. Don't make agreements you can't keep.", "And you may not get what you want. Just like you said. Yes people change their minds but changing it after the fact of getting pregnant is very AHish.", "You are.

Yikes.", "Realistically yes, but I was so out of after my c-section, my husband filled out and signed the paperwork. I would have been so angry if my husband writing whatever name he wanted, and I think it would not be advisable for her to use this strategy.", "Or she's just lying lol. She's lying about her reasoning so there's no reason to believe she's telling the truth about that", "\ud83e\udd28 .... Women who also have the 2nd, 3rd etc added to their name.

At the end of the day they need to agree on something together, for sure. I just feel sad for the guy", "She misunderstood a family tradition with Patriarchy. Thats all we need to know. OP YTA.", "Because a lot of women just consider men sperm donors and paychecks.", "People change and grow. Marriage is about compromise. She entertained the idea which does not equal to 100% agreeing to it. Both sides are 100% valid in how they feel, but if you are so worried about naming a child then you probably shouldnt have even gotten married. You just keep talking like it was this whole plan that the wife had to lie about changing the sons name, which is just painting her in a bad light for no reason.

People are allowed to change their minds, especially about something as big as their kids name, that doesn\u2019t make them an AH.", "This seems a good compromise imo. Agree on a unique nickname going forward, while following the family naming tradition. As \"son the IV\" grows, he can then decide how he will be called, because he will have a choice.

Its only HER baby, when its about important decisions", "She wasn't lying, she thought she would be good with the name. Now that the future baby is actually present, she changed her mind. She's allowed to do that. Many people go through lots of different names for that very reason. Lots of big decisions sit at the \"open for consideration\" state until a decision actually needs to be made. Feelings change when you're faced with the realization that this is a lifetime choice.", "Yes it is. It's a person's name, it's not getting a bike or a take out dinner. If she changed her mind about what she wants an entire baby's name to be, that is a good enough reason to bring it back to the table.", "This seems most likely reason.", "Not all dreams translate into real life well.", "Her job isn\u2019t to meet her husbands expectations lmao, it\u2019s their kid, not just his kid.

I think having there's merit in sharing a first or middle name with a relative, and it would be a totally fair compromise to use one of the names, but expecting both names with no say from the mother of the child seems wrong tbh.", "Her calling the baby hers, not theirs, is whats telling. Her using \"the patriarchy\" to exist it, also points to the problem being her, not him.", "But what does \u201centertained\u201d even mean in this context? Did she ever tell him that she was against it? Did she have a discussion about her thoughts on it? Or did she not say anything and go along with it, hoping that he\u2019d be alright with not having the traditional name when the time came? \n\nOf course people are allowed to change their minds, but for something as big as this, it has to be discussed about beforehand. I don\u2019t mean to make assumptions, but I\u2019m going to assume that if it got to this point where the baby is about to pop out, she had failed to mention any issues with the name before.", "If she was a maybe then and a no now, then NTA.\n\nBut it the way OP is saying it, and the husband is reacting lead me to believe that was not the case.", "See, I disagree due to how important this is to her husband. It sounds like, instead of having the hard conversation earlier (when he could still walk away if this was a deal breaker) she lied and now it\u2019s too late.", "She goes on a rampage about the archaic patriarchal norms she doesn\u2019t agree with, but was fine with before pregnant, then says she changed her mind for no reason, just life.

You aren\u2019t the same person you were one, five or ten years ago - your opinions and perspective on some things have likely changed. I am more inclined to believe OP was open to the idea, but has now since changed her mind. Which is a very normal and human thing to do.", "Okay, well that's weird because it's a living person.", "He is allowed to feel disappointed, but she is also allowed to not name her kid that. \n\nAnd nothing in this says she is going to pick the other name by herself lol, she just isn\u2019t okay with giving the kid this specific name.", "Pretty certain she mentioned saying yes in a hypothetical context \ud83e\udd14", "If you are right, then I would respectfully change my opinion to NAH. But the way it\u2019s \u2018my son\u2019 and not \u2018our son\u2019 coupled with the fact she says she has a name picked out already makes me think that change isn\u2019t gonna come\u2026could be wrong though", "She\u2019s allowed to her refer to her kid as her kid lol, that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s excluding the father or will insist on picking a name he doesn\u2019t want.
