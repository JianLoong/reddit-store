{"id": 32530, "submission_id": "18cuik0", "title": "AITA for telling my dad it's not my job to make sure my half siblings have a mom?", "selftext": "My parents divorced when I (17m) was 5. I'm not sure on why. Part of me has always figured dad cheated on mom because he was with someone suspiciously fast afterward, like that same month fast,  but my mom never spoke about it. She just told me both she and dad loved me and that would never change and I would never have to choose between my parents.\n\nMy dad was in two live-in relationship's post divorce. When I was 7 he was with \"Jen\" and had Luna (9) with her and then when I was 10 he was with \"Bree\" and had Harry (7) with her. Jen and Bree both stopped being mom's to their kids and so my dad became a single full time parent to my half siblings. From that point onward my dad has tried to convince mom she could step up and at least fill some kind of female role model relationship with them. He also corrects me on the half siblings term and says we are just siblings and if I were to call them just my siblings, it might soften mom's heart to being a female or maternal figure for them.\n\nHe would ask mom on my behalf to let me have my half siblings over to her house during her custody time (my parents share equal time with me). He would claim I really missed my half siblings when I was gone and he would claim I wanted to spend every holiday with them, etc. None of this is true. I never said those things or implied them.\n\nLuna is having a really hard time having no female family members. She has a dad, two half brother's and an uncle. So dad has been more forceful about mom's part in all of this lately and now he is trying to rope me in more.\n\nHe sat me down recently and told me my half siblings deserve to have mom's and I could help them with that, I could share my mom and let them feel the love they deserve to feel. He said I have always treated them like lesser siblings. First with always using half and then with not trying to include them in my life at my mom's house. He told me this is where my role as big brother needs to really take off.\n\nIn response I told him it's not my job and has never been my job to provide my half siblings with a mom. I told him it was on him and their actual mom's to do that. And I told him it was sick how he kept trying to rope my mom in. I told him to accept that he only had one kid with mom and she was only obligated to care for me. His answer to that was I was disappointing him with both my response and lack of concern for the overall wellbeing of my half siblings and he told me to do better, be better and care more about my innocent little siblings.\n\nI told my mom about it and she tore dad a new one for putting this on me. She told me I am not wrong in what I said to him. But my uncle also said I could have more compassion for my innocent half siblings.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701951972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cuik0/aita_for_telling_my_dad_its_not_my_job_to_make/", "score": 4245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure on why. Part of me has always figured dad cheated on mom because he was with someone suspiciously fast afterward, like that same month fast,  but my mom never spoke about it. She just told me both she and dad loved me and that would never change and I would never have to choose between my parents.\n\nMy dad was in two live-in relationship's post divorce. When I was 7 he was with \"Jen\" and had Luna (9) with her and then when I was 10 he was with \"Bree\" and had Harry (7) with her. Jen and Bree both stopped being mom's to their kids and so my dad became a single full time parent to my half siblings. From that point onward my dad has tried to convince mom she could step up and at least fill some kind of female role model relationship with them. He also corrects me on the half siblings term and says we are just siblings and if I were to call them just my siblings, it might soften mom's heart to being a female or maternal figure for them.\n\nHe would ask mom on my behalf to let me have my half siblings over to her house during her custody time (my parents share equal time with me). He would claim I really missed my half siblings when I was gone and he would claim I wanted to spend every holiday with them, etc. None of this is true. I never said those things or implied them.\n\nLuna is having a really hard time having no female family members. She has a dad, two half brother's and an uncle. So dad has been more forceful about mom's part in all of this lately and now he is trying to rope me in more.\n\nHe sat me down recently and told me my half siblings deserve to have mom's and I could help them with that, I could share my mom and let them feel the love they deserve to feel. He said I have always treated them like lesser siblings. First with always using half and then with not trying to include them in my life at my mom's house. He told me this is where my role as big brother needs to really take off.\n\nIn response I told him it's not my job and has never been my job to provide my half siblings with a mom. I told him it was on him and their actual mom's to do that. And I told him it was sick how he kept trying to rope my mom in. I told him to accept that he only had one kid with mom and she was only obligated to care for me. His answer to that was I was disappointing him with both my response and lack of concern for the overall wellbeing of my half siblings and he told me to do better, be better and care more about my innocent little siblings.\n\nI told my mom about it and she tore dad a new one for putting this on me. She told me I am not wrong in what I said to him. But my uncle also said I could have more compassion for my innocent half siblings.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Don\u2019t doubt yourself about that, no matter what your father or uncle say.\n\nI genuinely DO feel badly for your half siblings as well. They are growing up in a really sucky situation, each with two parents that, frankly, had no business having children. That\u2019s heartbreaking for them, nor is it fair. However, that is SOLEY the responsibility of both of their parents, and NOBODY else. They deserve better, but that is not up to you or your mother to provide them a better life. Do they not have any grandparents, aunts or other female relatives from either parent? Has your father even attempted reaching out to their mothers\u2019 sides of the family? I find it hard to believe that your mother is the ONLY possible female that exists. IMO, your father just sees your mother as the easiest and most convenient option. He doesn\u2019t want to put the extra effort and extra work in to find someone else more fitting for the role. Out of laziness and selfishness, he thinks it\u2019s easier to manipulate you and your mother into being his free babysitter, rather than actually finding someone more suitable for that role, especially for his daughter.\n\nYou and your mom have every right to be upset. Definitely don\u2019t take it out on your half siblings, and by all means try and be a kind and loving brother to them when you are at your dads, but you are not their surrogate parent, and neither is your mother. Your father needs to man up and take accountability for his own poor choices that put him (and his children) in this current position. Nobody else made those life choices but him, and thus it is nobody else\u2019s responsibility to dig him out of the current sink hole HE dug for himself. Him and your half siblings\u2019 mothers are the only ones with any responsibility to those children in this situation. It\u2019s not fair for him to put ANY of that responsibility on you or your mom.", "You need to tell your dad he disappoints you as a father, and he should have kept it in his fucking pants", "Your dad sounds like a clown NTA", "NTA obvs. But the way he\u2019s guilting you and your mother is deranged. And it sounds like he\u2019s been trying this manipulation schtick for some time, probably because having the kids full time is impeding him finding baby mama #4. Is there a reason living with your mother full time is not an option? At your age a court would be very sympathetic to your views. \n\nOh and tell your father to get a vasectomy and do the world a favour.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like your dad trying to get a cheap babysitter. If he is not careful he will have one son less if he keeps it up.", "NTA at all. You are 17. You are still a child yourself. If he wants his kids to have mother figures then maybe he should talk to their actual mothers. The only thing i can say that i personally feel is wrong here is that you refer to them as half siblings. I have 2 half siblings and 2 whole siblings but i never refer to the half ones as half. They are my siblings. Period. I dont even talk to one of them, i went no contact and im happy about it, and i still call him my brother. Constantly calling them half is gonna make them think you think lesser of them and build resentment if it hasnt already. Something my mum used to say when i was a kid and would call them my half siblings was \"which half is your sibling\". They are a single person. There is no splitting them in half, they are your brother/sister regardless of who the other parent is. Now, if they didnt live and grow up with you i could see the disconnect but from what youve said it sounds like they've lived and grown up with you since they were born. There's no need to constantly call them your half siblings.", "Tell your dad two things can be true at once.

You are not your half siblings parent your DAD is, and all the parenting is his job not yours. Explain clearly to your dad that you will go to court if needed to stop this ongoing abuse.

I don't think you're under any obligation to help him out, either. He made his bed and he can lie in it.\n\nIf your uncle is so concerned about it, what is he doing to step up and help? Has he offered the help of his wife/girlfriend/daughter?\n\nIf he doesn't have one, however, I do kinda agree with him that you should try to have compassion for your half-siblings, NOT by trying to force your mom to take care of them, but at least by doing your best to be a kind and supportive older brother when you're with them.\n\nI feel bad for Luna in particular. She's at an age where she's going to be starting her first period soon and that can be a scary thing without the guidance of another woman. Since your father seems to be irresponsible, I would encourage you to try and be compassionate towards her situation and do some research so you'll be able to help her when the time comes if necessary. If your father is too lazy to step up for her, which seems likely, having an understanding and knowledgeable older brother will help Luna get through it without major disasters. \n\nIf you can't bring yourself to care for Luna's sake, at least try and look at the situation as practice for potential future relationships of your own - your future girlfriend/wife/daughter (and even just female friends and coworkers) will appreciate it if you know the basics of periods, sanitary products, and how to treat side common effects like cramps. \n\nScarleteen is a very good and comprehensive resource; see [here](https://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/on_the_rag_a_guide_to_menstruation), for example. Here on reddit, /r/badwomensanatomy is less comprehensive/systematic, but a lot of fun, and a good place to get an idea of the range of women's experiences so you have a better sense of what's normal and what's not, and can help Luna with any questions she may have when the time comes.\n\nAgain, you have absolutely no obligation to do any of this. It's not your job to parent Luna, it's your dad's. If worst comes to worst, Luna can always talk to her school nurse and/or guidance counselor. But I do think a little bit of kindness will go a long way in this case.", "Siblings are just another person. You get to decide how you value them and what relationship you have with them.

THEY are the ones who suck, not you.  He should be taking every penny he can from them, and he should be insisting THEY step up.  \n\nBarring that, there are support groups out there.  Big brother/big sister has people who volunteer for this very thing!\n\nOr push to get money from the two moms, and hire a part time, female nanny.  Have her come by a handful of times a week to take care of the kids, and in the interviews, tell her you'd love if she could step in a little if the daughter needed another girl to talk to.\n\nLots of options, lots of things your dad should be doing.  Taking advantage of you and your mom isn't one of them.", "NTA, you spoke your truth, even if it was uncomfortable for your dad to have to hear it. And you (apparently?) didn't say it in front of the kids, so I'm assuming the worst thing that could have happened did not.\n\nBUT. Maybe I'm biased here, as this is very similar to my own family dynamic and I'm in Luna's position (so if she was the brother with two sisters). I don't get why these kids are such a burden that you and your mom can't just *be involved*? It would be one thing if you have tried and it didn't work, but you don't mention anything like that?\n\nAnd like, your dad isn't really asking you to do anything besides try and be open to it, he's more asking your mom. But for some reason you're not cool with it, and SHE definitely isn't cool with it... and I really don't understand why?\n\nAnd I don't get the whole \"lesser\" siblings thing. Is being an only child such a part of your IDENTITY that you can't just refer to them as your siblings? How can they be \"lesser\" siblings when you don't have any compare them to?\n\nHell, they're not even full siblings with EACH OTHER like me and my little sister. It's my older sister who has a different father... basically, flip the genders, and factor in that our mom is dead and it's MY SISTER that has been under pressure to act as \"the mom\", but she doesn't want to, and never has. It hurt me and my little sister. A LOT.\n\nBut if this turns out like my family? Uncle will get married and have four sons and his wife will LOVE that she has a girl she can be the mom of. And the younger six kids will become very close with each other while the oldest (that's you!) always welcome, but they know you don't show up so they don't bother inviting you. Plus you're so much older that the youngest didn't even know they had an older sibling until he was 11. They all have their own memories with each other and the family, and you aren't a part of any of them because you made the CHOICE not to be there.\n\nAnd Luna, as the oldest, though she didn't have a mother... she will get to BE the mother. And Harry will be \"the king\" (irony, I know) \"But what about Carrot?\" \"Oh yeah, if you wanna count HIM.\" That's how it's gonna be.\n\nMy aunt recently drove four hours down to where my sister lives to go dress shopping and do all the \"mother of the bride\" stuff before her upcoming wedding. My older sister? We'll be lucky if she even goes to the wedding. She has shafted her so many times and it's actually painful to see, considering lil sis actually expected better from her. The rest of us basically know what to expect out of her by now and have more or less come to terms with it.\n\nI just don't get it. You and your mom have the ability to make a difference in these kids lives, but you don't even seem interested in trying to give them something, ANYTHING? What would it take out of you?\n\nSomething's telling me you might just not be the type of person who enjoys \"other people\" in general...\n\nOne thing though: your dad isn't asking your mom to spend money on them so he doesn't have to, I hope?
