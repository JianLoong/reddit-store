It has caused emotional issues as well.\n\nEdited to clarify wording.", "Your first responsibility is the safety and wellbeing of your child. I feel for your nephew though. NTA", "Sounds like a cruel and almost evil way your sister is brining up her son..\nHe's gonna hate his mom down the line.. \n\nGood on you for not doing the same, and knowing it's bad, and working to not to the same. \nNTA", "Turning them out seems a bit harsh, although I'm not sure what their other options were, and I do agree, consequences, if I told my child to stop running around or they'll drop their ice cream, and they didn't listen, well, they aren't getting any more ice cream, but over all, I'd say NTA, your child didn't cause any harm, and didn't deserve to be yelled at in that situation.", "So what happens to that poor boy when he grows up and has a serious problem? He will absolutely NOT tell his parents and the problem might get bigger or worse and he will end up a mess. And if it's a big problem and he dwells on it on his own and decides that it's too big and he may as well not go on...\n\nWe need to be teaching our kids that to make mistakes is human. It's ok to have a problem, if we talk about it together and we can work out a solution together. You accidently broke a bowl when unloading the dishwasher? Darn that sucks! Did you hurt yourself? I have done that too once. Lets clean it up. Then when they need big help later on their way to be adults, they know that we can have a discussion and fix whatever it is as a team. Cause that's the job.", "NTA and good job breaking the cycle", "NTA, therapist here you are putting the work in to break the generational trauma instead of passing it down to your daughter. \n\nThere are often 2 types of parents, one recognises what they went through was traumatic and works hard to be/do better for their child. The other often doesn't realise it was traumatic or thinks I went through it so my child should and continues the trauma cycle on a new generation. \n\nHopefully when your nephew is older he'll realises there is a different way to be and he can work through the trauma his mum is inflicting upon him.", "NTA. Youre breaking the cycle of abuse you suffered from growing up. If your sister wasnt continuing the cycle, she wouldnt have been kicked out. Tell your family members to take her in.", "NTA. You can just tell them that you don't accept any kind of abuse in your house, specially from family and that your sister didn't obliged by it. They are welcome to take her in if they like that kind of abuse.", "Your doing a great job. I also was yelled at or hit for any stupid mistakes like breaking a glass. I wish i had someone like you growing up.\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Your child comes first. If your relatives are so engaged in this situation, let them take her in. Your poor nephew.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your nephew caused the situation, so where is his punishment in that logic?\n\nYour daughter dropped her ice-cream through no fault of her own. And war then yelled at for it.", "NTA\n\nYour childhood sounds very similar to mine. I\u2019m still struggling to not be terrified of making a mistake.", "NTA my mother did the same as your sister is doing to her son. We have only bare minimal contact because I want my kid to know his grandmother. She will never be allowed to baby sit or unsupervised visits. She knows this.\n\nYelling at children for accidents is so lazy and idiotic it\u2019s difficult for me to even comprehend.\nNeither of my grandparents on either side did this, so I don\u2019t know where it came from.\n\nEven with my younger relatives. If they make a mess, help them clean it up. \u201cThat can happen if you\u2019re doing X. We should try not to do that, let\u2019s go ahead and clean it up\u201d", "NTA, but can you take your nephew in?", "NTA you are trying to break the cycle (like others have pointed out) and it is sooo hard. im in the same boat. my eldest is 7 and for the first few years i parented the way i was brought up before something in my head finally snapped and showed me what im doing was not healthy. its a long battle and still find myself on occasions going back to the old ways but thankfully i always put a stop to it and unlike many adults i know, im not to big or proud to apologise to any of my kids when i make these mistakes. you are doing and amazing thing with your daughter and you will definitely prevent her from having alot of unnecessary trauma.", "So basically, you did exactly what your family does by severely punishing your sister after one mistake \u2014 pretty much a reflex reaction. You are NTA, but you might use this as a teaching moment with your sister. If she gets it, and is willing to try, you might reconsider. As for the rest of the family, be sure to thank them for their offers to take in your sister, as surely they would not complain to you if they were unwilling to do it themselves!", "NTA you've gotta protect your kid that's the most important thing", "The only reason I\u2019m sad she has left your house is because I feel like that little boy needed you to give him some comfort and love.\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nIt's not her place to discipline your child. Tell her that you're teaching her that it's okay to come to you when she makes a mistake instead of being afraid and hiding things from you. \n\n     Also tell them that your nephew is welcome to stay as long as he likes so long as sis isn't with him.", "I wholeheartedly concur with your loving parenting of your daughter (NTA for not punishing )and think your sister is blinkered by her upbringing and has not reflected on the harm it has caused and will cause her son.\n\nIt's a little ironic that you punish so drastically, your sister for making a mistake and your nephew. \n\nMaybe you were already feeling that you don't want to host them any more. That is your choice and your decision.\n\nYou were very kind to take them in but as soon as you knew the situation you could have laid some boundaries.", "Info: Did you set any clear rules and boundaries beforehand? Did you have a discussion about how living together in your house needed to be?", "NTA! Do not feel bad, even for your nephew. You actually gave him a great gift by modeling respectful parenting to him, since it's unlikely you'll actually get your sister to change her treatment of him. The difference between you two will help him down the line when he's recovering from the trauma of your sister's parenting.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Now I'm getting messages from my family asking me how could i turn away my sister and her son when they had nowhere to go and I'm heartless.\n\nI hate seeing this, why aren't they taking her in then, instead of just judging?", "NTA she made a mistake every kid makes\u2026 sure she wasn\u2019t listening to your sister but yelling at her isn\u2019t going to change the behavior. She was just being a kid", "NTA. Curious, you want your daughter to learn from her mistakes, not your sister? I understand frustration. Do you think that this could be a conversation with your sister as to why you parent the way you do? Why you believe that kids do not learn from punishments but from understanding and communication? Perhaps try this approach with your sister. While you have broken the cycle and can see how it is wrong and does not make sense, she hasn\u2019t. Could this start with an open and honest conversation rooted in a shared experience that can make you BOTH better parents?\n\nEdit to add: you choose not to punish your daughter over accidents or things she doesn\u2019t know better about (ie being careful, kids being kids and running in a house can cause carelessness and break a vase). Your sister does not know better either (given her upbringing). Just something to think about.", "INFO\n\nAre you doing anything about the emotional abuse your nephew is enduring?", "And, he's now homeless, which you don't seem to care about.", "Yep. I learned really quick as a kid to never make the same mistake again. Spilled food in the car on a road trip and got screamed at and told I ruined the vacation? Never eat in the car again. Touched something of my dad\u2019s and got yelled at about how disrespectful and rude I am? Don\u2019t ever touch anything that doesn\u2019t belong to me ever again. It\u2019s absolutely lazy as hell, the same thing could be accomplished by just calmly talking to a child. Yelling is what idiots do.", ">Abused children become abusive parents\u2014it is a cycle that some break out of, but most people do not.\n\nSaying most abuse victims become abusers is only perpetuating a stereotype that works to stigmatise abuse victims. I'm not saying abuse victims can't become abusers but saying most do is wrong and only makes things harder for victims.\n\n If you look it up, there's actually also research that shows victims of abuse as a child end up facing more abuse as adults.", "Yelling at children for dropping ice cream (outside!) isn\u2019t a mistake, it\u2019s a choice / action. And actions have consequences.", "Holding someone accountable for their actions isn\u2019t the same as punishing someone for a mistake. The sister yelled at the child for dropping an ice cream cone (which isn\u2019t even a mistake), and the sister was then kicked out of the house for her abusive actions. \n\nOP should not expose her child to further abusive actions just to help her sister be less abusive. The sister can do that away from the house.", "So you think the punishment should be the same for: tripping while running outside and dropping your ice cream where it lands on someone\u2019s shoe (accident) & throwing the ice cream at your mother in the living room (deliberate)?", "Actions have consequences.", "Physically harassing? They were kids. Kids chase. Not everything is problematic.", "\"Physically harassing\"?!  \n\nI'd call it \"playing\" personally.", "This is what drove me crazy whenever people found out about my abusive mother and assured me that it wasn\u2019t really her fault, that\u2019s how her mom treated her\u2014without knowing anything about the situation.  My maternal grandmother raised me, was a saint, and was blamed by others for my mothers poor choices and behavior until she died.  She probably blamed herself too and she did nothing wrong.  The fault rests with the abuser alone.", ">it is a cycle that some break out of, but most people do not. It sounds like you did and your sister didn\u2019t.\n\nYou did and your half-sister didn't.", "Personally I don\u2019t think you get to set a boundary with abusing someone. Your nephew is suffering unfortunately", "NTA for your reaction. Your daughter is highest priority.\n\n But I would try and get through to her, maybe write a letter and recommend resources and tell her that what you got as children was actually abuse, and especially keep the contact to your nephew open. By kicking them out, this has become more difficult. Try and let him know that your door is open for him, even if it's ten years later, in case he wants to get out of an abusive household.", "OP You are definitely NTA for stopping your sister from yelling at your child, but since you seem open to feedback, can I make a suggestion? 6 and 7 are old enough to take responsibility for mistakes. Could you have asked the kids to help you clean up the broken vase instead of doing it for them?\n\nI have so much admiration for you for breaking the cycle of trauma, but caution you not to reactively err in the opposite direction. Children should not be punished for making mistakes, but they should be taught to repair damage. It would make sense to ask them to help you clean, accept a sincere apology, and clarify the rule about not running in the house and suggest a consequence for if it happens again. Our general question any time damage happens is to ask, \"How can you fix this?\" and offer suggestions.", "Punishing an accident is non sensical because by definition it's not something a kid does on purpose. Punishments are supposed to teach kids appropriate behavior, not give them anxiety that at any point in time something could happen and they'll be yelled at.", "NTA. But I think you could try again to repair your relationship with your sister.\n I saw a video about siblings growing up differently and having \u201cdifferent parents\u201d despite growing up in the same household and having the same parents. Basically, the way parents treat and react to one child is never the same as another child\u2014 hence why oldest child, middle child, and youngest child can have vastly different behaviors. \n\nYou learned from your parents mistakes, but your sister didn\u2019t, there\u2019s a reason for that (what I talked about above). I commend you for breaking that cycle and raising your daughter a different way. She thought she was doing the right thing for your daughter, which, if anything shows she cares about her. Even if you (& I) disagree. That trauma growing up should help bond you two, not break you apart. Do you think you could talk to your sister again, even if it\u2019s to agree to disagree?", "But she has crossed your boundary and abused your child.

Me he doesn't yell at me either, we do fight like normal couples do.\n\nThis anxiety comes from my mother who would lose her ever loving shit if she came home a hour earlier than usual (without telling you) and dinner isn't ready yet or if something should break regardless if you broke it you would get yelled at and sometimes even slapped or stuff like that because you had to have know it was going to break soon or it's because you miss treated the item and that's why it broke...\n\nI sometimes just freak out if I haven't spoken to him before he left because I can't gauge his mood or know how he's going to feel before he gets home and I had to do that with my mom... You needed to predict her moods and mood swings before she knows how's she's feeling...\n\nI vividly remember the washing machine breaking because it was 3 generations old and never been serviced and thinking of ways I would rather die than tell her the machine is broken and the laundry isn't done yet...\n\nBut happy ending haven't spoken to her in 7years...and don't intend to anytime soon either.", "or become an abuser in turn, just as his mom took after her mom.

It's always hard to explain how I've been so certain I didn't want kids cause the solution is so simple: don't abuse your children the same way as you were abused.
