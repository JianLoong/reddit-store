My Husband and I have been together since high school.\nWhen we first moved into our apartment after we graduated last year things were great, we split the chores evenly. Although he fed and walked our dogs more than I did. Around September he started sleeping in the guest bedroom. I\u2019m a nightshift nurse so this isn\u2019t totally out of character because he works as a trainer at a gym and has regular hours, but he stopped sleeping in our bed even on our days off. \n\nHe\u2019s gotten more religious, I found a bible in our kitchen with notes in his handwriting.\nHe stopped doing his part around the apartment. Before, he would walk the dogs and feed them on the days I work. Now I come home and more often than not they are in their kennels and I have to walk them after being on my feet all night. \n\nWhen I wake up their bowls are still empty and our one dog is so old he can\u2019t hold his bladder for that long so he pees in the kitchen. The sweet boy knows it\u2019s easier for me to clean up the tile. Husband gets up early so I don\u2019t know why this is happening. He has a long lunch break where he normally comes home to take care of them. \nThis is especially hurtful because I make sure to do everything when I\u2019m off and he works. \nDishes from whatever he was eating the night are consistently in the sink or on the counter and although he doesn\u2019t sleep in our room anymore he leaves his dirty laundry lying around.\nWhen I confronted him, he did apologize, but he said he was under a lot of stress at work, and he felt like he needed more support here at home than what I was giving him. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to devalue his feelings or anything but he works at a gym. I work in an ICU. One of my favorite patients died last week and he never knew how much I cried that day. My work makes him uncomfortable, so I don\u2019t talk about it around him. \n\nI didn\u2019t say any of this. Instead I asked him how I could support him more in our home and he stated and I quote. \u201cI need us to start falling into our god assigned roles.\u201d I can\u2019t say I remember much else of what he said.\nEssentially it was some things about him being a leader and me being a follower and that I should do the majority of the chores. He felt like he wasn\u2019t as happy as his parents were in their marriage. This took my by complete surprise. \n\nToo angry to say anything else I said \u201cIf you want to live with someone who will cook and clean for you while you do nothing go fuck your mom.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I said it, I think I was extra frustrated, because the dog pissed on the floor again but now I\u2019m at work, crying on my break looking up the cheapest couples therapists.

Partnership is gone unless he somehow gets a wake up call but in the meantime you need to make all the accommodations for you dogs and living that you would do if he wasn't there because he will NOT do it. You can choose to suffer for yourself while you come to grips with who he is now, but you can't inflict that on your dogs.

It sounds like he's getting brainwashed and frankly, if he wants that kind of wife, and if he's attached to his new religious view, you may not be able to salvage this marriage. This is been coming for awhile. This notion of 'god assigned roles.\" He doesn't want you to be a person with feelings. He wants you to be a servant in the home, obedient to his law, and he doesn't want to have to do anything that smaks of helping around the house. And honestly, I'd be kicking him to the curb for torturing the dogs. Because that's what he's doing, out of laziness, selfishness, and some weird idea of his holy role. NTA", "NTA. If it's just a year of marriage, you can bounce. No kids, no property, no problem. That said, has he gotten any new friends that prompted this new love for religious bullshit?", "What the hell role did God assign you? And how come He didn't tell you to your face about your life's mission? The thing I love most about faith is that its transparent. You can look it up and read for yourself everything you want to know, after all. And BTW, your husband is on some serious bullch\\*t. Just sayin' in case it hadn't already occurred to you.\n\nNTA. If he can literally translate it from the Aramaic that God said that crap, I will give him a cookie and a glass of milk. Miriam. Deborah, Lydia, Queen Esther,  Leah, . . . Can your husband actually read his Good Book?\n\nDid he miss the part where Christ says how a man is to treat his wife? He can look that one up too.\n\nomg.

You need an intervention, if you think he is worth it.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nLooks like this was God's way of saying, \"Let me give OP a sign about where this relationship is going.\"\n\nFYI, your dogs are more considerate than your husband. Additionally, what he's doing is essentially neglectful and abusive to your dogs. He should've been kicked out back into a child's place to his mother's. Since he admitted to not taking care of the dogs because he's stressed that YOU have a career and should be taking care of the home instead.", "NTA. I strongly support the idea that he may  be developing a mental illness, especially considering the sudden onset. I hate to mention this, but is there any chance he is using performance enhancing substances?", "NTA and do not let this AH steer you to religious\u201cmarriage counseling.\u201d  The pastor is probably where he\u2019s getting this crap in the first place.", "You don't need a therapist, you need a divorce lawyer.

The sad truth might be that he's too far gone to be saved.", "Your poor sweet dog. That makes me want to cry.\n\nNTA. Get the hell outta this bullshit relationship.", "NTA. If he wants tradition then they're plenty of things he should be doing as well. He can't have it both ways.", "NTA, all things considered, although that was a bit of a crude remark.  Not sure what is going on with your husband.  I can't help wondering if he seems normal otherwise (expecting you to fall into some religious role he has read about or whatever) as religious ideation can signify mental illness and he's the right age for that to manifest if he's afflicted.  For sure it sounds like there is a big disconnect and change in your relationship that sounds concerning.  Starting with a counselor is a good idea as this may be more than you realize and some professional guidance seems indicated.  Good luck to you.", "The way I see it, he made a very inappropriate comment (which, if you just went along with it to keep the peace, would take a huge toll on your mental well being in the long run), so you fired back with an inappropriate comment (one that only stings temporarily).

You did not go too far.  He needs to hear that his behavior, and the attitudes he's taking on, are worthy of ridicule.  What he's doing is not the way to achieve happiness in your marriage, and you told him.  Good for you.", "NTA\n\nHe couldn\u2019t have shocked you more if he had slapped you across the face with that bible, which\u2026he kinda did.", "JUST GET OUT. He is this demanding and unsupportive NOW, when you\u2019re both young and have no children? Imagine adding the stress of homeownership, a more demanding job, kids that might be ill or neurodivergent, imagine getting a serious illness yourself while the responsibilities pile up - do you think he would change completely and step up? If not, just LEAVE. Most partners are better than this. You\u2019re way too young to give up on everything life has to offer.", "NTA tell him you have to quit your job to do your assigned role so he will need to take a second job to fulfill his", "NTA! Please explain to him that if he wants to do the God-given roles\u2026He needs to step up and start fully financially supporting your household because you must become a stay at home wife! Lol! Watch how fast he backtracks on what he says he wants\u2026Seriously though if you can\u2019t even talk to your spouse about your day at work, start couples counseling stat!

Also, historically women have not been in happy marriages. They just had no way to leave so they didn\u2019t have an option. That would not be a happy marriage. It would be you being miserable and him getting to be lazy. \nThis kind of shows he doesn\u2019t care that much about your well-being or happiness. \nI mean the fact that he\u2019s happy to hurt dogs to prove a point is pretty messed up and shows his morals right now.", "NTA. IDGAF how hard his job may be, if he's trying to play the stress card against an ICU doctor/nurse, he loses instantly.

NTA.\n\n(Ps OP my first BF was this kind of human, things didn't improve)", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI might be totally wrong, but I smell denial here. \n\nHe wants to fuck his gym buddies and instead has turned to religion.  \n\nTry to find a therapist that isn't religious and is LGBTQI+ friendly and see if they can get him to stop blaming you for \"not fitting his god assigned roles\"\n\nGood luck and take care.", "Honestly, I\u2019m going to have to vote NTA for all of the reasons the other commenters have left. \n\nI\u2019d also like to say that you need to leave. He has pushed you into taking on more responsibilities to make it so he has none, he has no kindness or love in his heart for living beings that he leaves in crates for extended periods of time, he is making it so that you are alone and crying over your day without his support, he is trying to demand you follow his new found belief system because someone else did something he thought fit the picture. \n\nThis religious ideology that he has, which says that women should take care of the house also says that a man should provide for his family. Forget the money, his family has nothing to do with his mother and the way she would do things - he left his mother to marry you. His family is you and those precious pooches. He\u2019s effectively withholding comfort and compassion to his wife, thus providing nothing for her. He is ignoring the needs of his children (not feeding, emptying or exercising the dogs), and he\u2019s demanding that you are responsible for all of it. That is not how it works. He wants to take the \u201cG-d assigned role\u201d of subservient, but he doesn\u2019t want to take on the \u201cG-d assigned role\u201d of actual man of the house. He wants you to be mother to the dogs, father to the dogs, wife to him and husband to yourself. Honestly, you can do all of that without a preachy roommate making you miserable. \n\nYou deserve better. \n\nYou can try to fix him, and you may want to put in that time and effort, there your choice. But, in the meantime, the Sweet Boy is suffering the consequences in his last years. Please, if you decide to stay, make the right choice by the puppies. If you decide to leave (or throw him out), I know you\u2019ll do right by them all alone, and way better than he has been. \n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA.", "He needs to go back and read Ephesians 5, the whole chapter, not just the cherry picked parts that radicals like to use to keep wife\u2019s as their subjects. I think you were in the right for your comment. My brother likes to pull this garbage every so often. The only way I found a combat this is by pointing out how he hypocritically cherry pics versus two fit into his agenda. In your case, Unfortunately, if he is radicalized and can\u2019t walk back from it, you\u2019re probably going to end up in a divorce because your life views are so different.", "NTA. He's been brainwashed my some religious cult that also advocates men's rights.", "NTA. He needs to find someone who wants to live the way his parents did. He can\u2019t be with someone who earns more than him, then expect you to do all the household chores too. He\u2019s married you under false pretences.", "NTA frankly he should have sat down with you and said \"I need to talk with you\" then he could have come out and said what he wanted and you could have discussed it for him to freeze you out without discussion, I suspect this marriage is going to crumble pretty soon.\n\nBut that's good you're looking at marriage counseling and you're going to try to save the marriage I hope so but be prepared to end up walking away from everything.", "NTA this isn\u2019t going to end well.", "replace \"religion\" with \"cult\" in your mind and see if that changes how you view the situation. \"gotten more religious\" sounds fairly innocuous, but he's acting way more like he's gotten sucked into some very disturbed thinking.", "NTA.\n\nThe next time he starts spewing his biblical propaganda,  you can encourage him to blow his father. \n\nFuck that guy for telling you that.", "NTA. I probably would have said worse. There is nothing wrong with having so called \"traditional gender roles\" if that's what you both agreed on before entering the relationship(which obviously you did not), but generally this requires the man to make enough so that the woman can stay home to take care of the house, kids etc.. he's out of his mind assuming you should have to do both! If you both work full time then you split house work 50/50! Did his mom work full time AND do all of the house work?! My guess is no. And if she did I bet she was/is miserable and resentful.", "NTA. You should find a lawyer instead of therapy. I think he is weird.", "NTA \n\nHas he always been religious? He needs a come to jesus talk about how he can\u2019t unilaterally decide that he\u2019s going to dump all the shared responsibilities in you and call it your god given duties. I\u2019m assuming he doesn\u2019t make enough to support the both of you? So where does your job come in to this?\n\nAnyways, if he\u2019s been secretly hiding this beliefs all along, there is mo changing him and you just need to get out.

Why would you even want to be with someone like that?", "NTA but please listen to me closely. When I was 19 I married a man who did a 180 on me like this. Not wanting my marriage to fail and embarrassed that I didn\u2019t listen to my Mom and \u201cslow down\u201d I conformed and turned into a slave and sex servant. I had twins with this man at 21 and soon after he started physically abusing me whenever things were not done to his liking or I said something he didn\u2019t like. At 24 I had enough, I took my kids and ran. Because I had stayed home and had no access to the finances this man was able to get a lawyer, drag me into court, point out I was homeless and jobless and also discredit my abuse even though I had pictures and a couple witnesses. In the end he won custody of my kids and destroyed the next 13 years of my life by withholding them or setting terms on how I could see or talk to them. Fast forward to now, a month ago my twins called me and disclosed massive abuse and trauma and explained that he was raising them to \u201cbe the wife your mom should have been\u201d. I flew out and took custody the next week with the help of the sheriffs department and CPS. Moral of the story here is GET OUT NOW. You have the option right now. Things are better for survivors these days but Christian extremism is real and it will destroy your identity. Please don\u2019t lay down and allow him to take your self esteem and self worth away.", "NTA but get out now! Definitely stop doing anything for him in the meantime.

If he continues in his Bronze Age beliefs then you will need to get divorced so you can live in the 21st Century like the rest of the planet.", "i\u2019m torn, mostly because i think it was shitty for him to say that, however, your comment was way out of left field. i do completely get your frustration because you work so extremely hard at your job and then having to come home and continue working there to take care of the dogs, clean, laundry, and etc., can be so draining. coming home from what you do as a job, just to get told by your partner that you\u2019re basically not doing enough, probably triggered you. i\u2019m curious as to why he had such a sudden change of what he wanted because his shift in behavior seems off.", "NTA. You're the one working hard on and off the job. You earn more money. Religious gender roles work. But only when both parties are willing to act upon their role. That's 1. \n2) The man SHOULD then be the sole or major breadwinner, while the woman CAN stay at home to make a comfortable and loving atmosphere. \n3) Couples work better with similar ideologies and goals.

Earns his money AND helps around the house while he can.\n\nI would suggest to fix this issue would be to apologise for what you said (it was pretty harsh), accept your mistake(there is nothing wrong about it), then don't demand an apology (not because he wasn't wrong but to keep the peace and to go along with the next step smoothly) and have a good conversation with your husband deeply discussing both of your povs and eventually coming up with a solution that helps both ppl.", "You slipped your tongue. What you said was a little too much. I was expecting his mom to be involved in this whole thing but okay.\nYTA for saying something very mean. But NTA in general. He\u2019s going through some cult religious shit. Learning all wrong stuff. What does he mean by traditional roles. He\u2019s learning to be stupid. Your relationship is falling apart and things burn to ashes when religion gets involved. We know that from hundreds of examples from the world. So have a conversation with him. If that\u2019s what he expects and wants you need to let him go. \nAlso, he should be earning more than you, take more manly responsibilities if he wants traditional roles.

Husband has clung unto religion for purpose. It is not clear what OP is clinging to to keep sane. Either break up or, communicate and work it out.", "ESH. Your husband is the AH for using religion as an excuse to foist all the unpleasant housework on you, and you are the AH for suggesting he commit incest in a really unforgivable way. That's not a remark he's ever going to forgive or forget. If your respect for him has fallen to that level, your marriage is probably over.", "YTA/NTA. There are too many issues on your relationship.
