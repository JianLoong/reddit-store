Your mother blabs to a friend and that friend makes your girlfriend experience the exact situation she was trying to avoid and you're on the fence about telling your mom that that information was not hers not share? If making your mother self reflect would tarnish your relationship, you should probably relay those exact sentiments to her so she can decide weather or not she wants to waste any amount of her life on a hopeless momma's boy.

Also, are you OK with your mum asking help only from your girlfriend?", "YTA, you noticed your gf getting uncomfortable, but didn't put a stop to the invasive questions.

Bonding time could have happened another time, not after just three months of getting to know each other and still getting comfortable with each other. Your mother was taking liberties. You need to be on team gf now, not team mommy.", "YTA for not stopping the guest. \n\nAlso the fact your mom had your 3 month gf she barely knows doing chores when she is a guest is very weird to me? Maybe a culture thing, but if my mother saw me doing that to my kids SO when they were a guest, she\u2019d be very disappointed in me. I understand you believe your mother was trying to bond with her, and that may be true, but it definitely didn\u2019t work and came off rude, especially if your gf was the only one asked as she pointed out. You either need to explain what your mother was trying to do to your gf better and/or explain the miscommunication to your mom and ask her to find a different bonding activity with your girlfriend.", "YTA.

You tell your mom that she lost her mother and doesn\u2019t like to talk about her: your mom proceeds to tell everyone and when her friends bring it up- you don\u2019t shut it down. You didn\u2019t change the topic. That is the move right there where you screwed up. \n\nAs for helping in the kitchen- if you had a sister would your mother have asked this of her boyfriend?", "YTA.  If your mom is singling your gf out in ways that make her uncomfortable, you need to address this if you want your gf to remain your gf.  Surely you can do this without jeopardizing your relationship with your parents!", "YTA. You are a terrible BF and and someone she can't rely on. You admit you will let your parents do what they want to her and you would just smile and node in order to feel beloved. You would sell her out and throw her under the bus without hesitation to make your mom happy, and double down on it admitting that is your strategy.\n\nA guest is bothering her with the subject she warned you and your mom she can't handle, and is objectively one of the worst things that can happen to someone. Is boyfriend stepping up to protect her and her most inner pain? Nhaaa. He's watching and nodding like an idiot.\n\nYour mom is treating your gf like a maid and not like a guest? Is BF saying, mom let me stack those plates (I ate and I can clean up?), let me boil this potatoes? Is BF telling his mom let her be a guest and enjoy dinner, leave her alone? Nhaaaaa, he just watches and smiles like an idiot, eating his potatoes and having his plates removed for him like the giant baby that he is.\n\nWhen your gf told you she isn't appreciated being treated like that - does bf apologizes for not protecting her and for taking advantage of her? Nhaaaaa. He tells her it's 'bonding', because that's how women bond - by serving him.\n\nThat is what you have to offer her - everyone in your family will do and say whatever they what to her while you smile and node. If she asked for something in advance - it will be ignored. Even if it's the most traumatic horrible thing - she would be ignored. There is one goal and one goal only for the interactions with your family - whatever makes your mom loves you would be done. You gf needs to rip her soul apart about her dead mom during the holidays - vs having to say a comment to your mom - your gf needs to give her soul. That's what you offer. That's why it's better for you that she is an orphan from her mom because orphans are usually easier to take advantage of.\n\nSo in conclusion, you are a AH bf and AH human, you're a big spoiled mama's boy that would sell everyone and anything to keep this status, and you're heading fast towards divorce before you're even started. Every girl you would ever marry would eventually divorce you, even the most orphanest poorest women would make you up eventually and run for the hills.\n\nThe cure is therapy, but the way you are so flippant about it and in complete awareness, and the severity of what you let her go through after so little time and for such a tiny reason (you know, like the difference between selling your wife for a million dollars, and selling her for fifty cents) - all of this point to a very very extreme case of mama's boy that I don't think therapy would help you. I think you're going to need at least three divorces,  bitter exes and broken children before any meaningful change could start to take place.\n\nAs it is - you're an unsafe environment for spouses.", "YTA. It was literally none of your mom's business to even mention your gf's deceased mom to the guest in question. Furthermore, your gf was also a guest herself, and thus was not required to be doing chores. That had nothing to do with bonding. If your mom wants to bond with her, she can sit down and talk over a glass of wine, not demand she do chores for her. You don't want to ruin your relationship with parents, fine, but, because your mom chose not to respect your gf's feelings, and you choosing your parents over her, you've already tarnished your relationship with your gf. If you want to repair the relationship, you need to tell your mom to apologize, and also explain, that just like with any person dealing with a death in the family, your gf didn't want to talk about it and it was extremely rude of your mom and the guest to assume that was remotely appropriate.\n\nEdit: dumb word mix up", "YTA. Your mom asked one person, her to help with dishes and cooking. Maybe she was bonding. Maybe it was sexism? Maybe she was picking on her. Regardless it\u2019s your responsibility to bring it up. Your gf is correct.

Yeah, you may not feel you need to say something to your mom, but your girlfriend does. What you need to ask yourself is how is this going to last long term without you having her back? She will never had the life time of experience you do with your parents because she doesn't have that long. If that is what you're looking for in a girlfriend, someone who will never question you parents because they've had a life time to know your parents crap... may I suggest your sister or cousins? Sorry for the joke but if you want someone to shut up because they don't have a lifetime knowledge of your parents your options are extremely limited. \n\nMaybe your mom was trying to bond with her, or maybe your mother was being a jerk. You may never know because you're too much \"mommy's little man\" to confront her on her crap. Three months apparently is long enough to bring a girl to a major family gathering, but not enough to have her back.

It was great that you warned your mom ahead of time, and she may have been trying to also be kind by telling her friend; unfortunately that backfired. Maybe it was because of that fiasco that GF felt singled out by your mom. I personally would've taken the asking for help the way you did: that your mom is welcoming her into the family by including her in family things rather than keeping her at a polite distance like the rest of the guests. I think it'd be good to bring these concerns up with your parents so they can know how your GF is feeling and how they can be more sensitive to her. But I don't think there's any reason to \"call them out\" since I don't see any cruel behavior on their parts. Hopefully this is just something that can be talked out and relationships can move forward smoothly. I wonder if GF is trying to see if you're willing to stand up for her. You didn't with the rude guest and maybe she's wondering if you'll let your family treat her poorly as well.", "nta.  i have a different take.  maybe your mom told someone else so that they would be aware and not ask the gf where her mom lives etc. also, besides wanting to get to know your gf better so asked for her help, she may have thought it would keep her from dwelling about her loss.  i think your mom was trying, not being cruel", "Dude you can sit quiet and leave your balls in moms purse, which is fine because if you continue this route you won\u2019t be getting any much longer. Or you can remember that you are in a relationship, theoretically a MATURE relationship and have a duty to see to it that she is treated with respect while at your family\u2019s. If this was just a thoughtless mistake, a short conversation can do wonders. If it\u2019s malicious, or mysoginistic then at least you\u2019ll know and can help your girlfriend when it happens again.

NTA, IMO.\n\nI lost my Mum at 18 and Christmas is a tough time, but my take on this sort of thing is that people who show curiosity and care are coming from a good place.\n\nWhat's challenging is your girlfriend's assumption that your Mum was picking on her. She's reacting to the story she has made up about your Mum, not necessarily what happened. \n\nI think moving forward it could be helpful to talk to your girlfriend about what your boundaries are, what support she needs around your family and how you can keep communication as open as possible with everyone involved.", "HUGE NTA. \nGrief takes many forms and it sounds like your very new girlfriend misconstrued events. I don\u2019t see your mom telling a stranger about her mom passing away as problematic, was it a secret?? Maybe your mim could have told that person to not raise the issue but I don\u2019t see any ill intent. I think you can raise this incident with your mom but it might change your mom\u2019s approach to her, and not for the better! \n\n3 months is fairly new so maybe a conversation about what support she needs is warranted so you can navigate it with more awareness. But honestly the whole situation just sounds like she was triggered but mere questions and that\u2019s her experience so it\u2019s valid, but I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d sound an alarm to my mother about being insensitive. Again, maybe just ask that she not share the info or reiterate that your girlfriend is still very triggered by even talking about her mother so it\u2019s best to avoid.", "Let's be honest, she's a 3 month in length gf. If this is the shit storm already, imagine further down the line. Do you want that in your life? Regardless of the supposed wrongs and rights of that meal?\n\nThe fact she's raising helpibg your mum as an issue, shows, imo, an air of entitlement and the fact she's laying her cards out for you to see. She's to ve the priority, no matter what and she will ensure that you have no relationship with your mother either. Be that deliberately or subconsciously.\n\nYour mum, presumably shared the information to avoid issues being raised /make the guest aware.\n\nSadly, her mum died 7 years ago. Death is a part of life. Harsh maybe. But if she really cannot function as a result, she needs to get help.

She\u2019s already been made to feel uncomfortable, she\u2019s been triggered on the loss of her mother, and her boyfriend hasn\u2019t stepped up at any point, so she probably felt completely isolated.

My mom is coming up on 10 years this spring. Does it suck or make me sad or wistful for the past? Sure.  But it\u2019s not a secret. 9/10 I would *appreciate* some one filling others in because it feels like the air is sucked out of the room when someone asks where my mom is or what my parents are doing, and I have to explain one is dead and one is \u2026 unreliable. 99% of the time everyone leaves it alone on purpose. \n\nWe don\u2019t know that mom knew that friend would make it A Thing. Shit, I might even like talking about her. Yes, not *everyone* will feel the same, but also not *everyone* will feel attacked by the questions. It would be better not to ask, but at worst, this is an NAH situation. No one had ill intent or was particularly thoughtless. One sensitive person met one inquisitive person. Friends could have asked less, but gf could have  politely shut them down 3 questions earlier or stayed in if Xmas is just too difficult.

Or maybe genuinely trying to make her feel like part of the family. I remember my MIL doing something similar in early dating days. Looking back, I realize that she totally didn't need my help. She prob noticed that I was a little uncomfortable/awkward standing around with nothing to do so she made me feel useful and part of the team by asking for some simple help. It was a loving thing to do and showed her acceptance of me. Hopefully when this mom realizes that GF is more comfortable being treated as a guest instead of family, she'll graciously change her ways. But I don't think she was being a jerk.", "Exactly\u2014> mother is definitely  an asshole as is OP.\n\nMother gossips about the poor orphan GF who has no mother for Christmas, then makes her work for her food.\nIt is a Christmas story, but not a happy one!\n\nIf OP can\u2019t mention to their family what an ass mother made of herself, then op does not have a good relationship with their parents and lacks as much insight as their mother.", "It also looks somewhat sexist.", "What exactly was the asshole move here?", "I agree with everything you said. \n\nI'm just going to be *that guy* for a moment to point out that it's \"deceased\", not diseased", "You could have said I'm an asshole and this is how I would have dealt with it. Bonus you could have saved everyone time", "I thought the same. I'm guessing GF has been in bad spots before where she was taken advantage of, so she jumped to conclusions. The important thing is not to brush off her concern but get to the bottom of it and figure out where communication went wrong.", "I can answer this!!!! I *HATED* that my MIL would ask ME to help her in the kitchen.  It felt like she was asking because I had ovaries.  BEING A GUEST, I had an expectation of relaxing by the fire, not helping to prep while my husband was hanging out with the rest of the guests.  I resented that, and these days, I say,  \"Oh, I'll go get Husband to help you.\" \n\nThe mom here was probably trying to bond, in a way she'd been taught,  like my MIL. \n\nThe GF in this scenario needs to find a script for when she's uncomfortable with any kind of conversation. Something like,  \"Talking about my mum is very difficult for me, and I would prefer to change the topic.  So, does anyone else *also* love ice fishing?\" \n\nNot sure if anyone here is the AH, except the lady who grilled a woman about her dead mom.", "people grieve differently, though. i was fine to talk about my mom after a year, but i know a man whose dad died twenty years ago and he refuses to talk about it. depends on whether you grieve healthily or not. \n\nbesides, it doesn\u2019t really matter how long it\u2019s been or how to ridiculous it seems to you. honestly it doesn\u2019t matter whether it was her dead mom or if it was her weight or facial scars or a medical condition. the fact is that oop knew it upsets his significant other, but he had no problem letting his family members upset her.\n\ni agree that the family members did nothing wrong. if they had no idea that she was uncomfortable, how were they supposed to know? however, oop was completely aware & he didn\u2019t put a stop to it.", "You're right on that last part, she did not address it herself when she could have but I do believe it's because she didn't want to rock the boat.", "This would hold more weight with me if OP was taking part in the chores too.

If her friend either forgot or went against those directions, the mother (and OP) should have interrupted to redirect, and they owe the GF an apology for creating a situation that specifically went against what she wanted.\n\n*No one had ill intent or was particularly thoughtless.*\n\nYes they were- the friend asking specific questions about the deceased mother of a stranger was, at least, particularly thoughtless. The mother was thoughtless for not telling the friend not to do this.\n\nOP was particularly thoughtless for failing to intervene, and for making his girlfriend feel like he cares so little about her he couldn't even tell his parents they were a bit rude to her.\n\nThe only one who wasnt thoughtless here was the GF, who is definitely \\*not\\* obliged to spend christmas alone if she doesnt want to have a random stranger ask intrusive personal questions.", "Info needed: OP why the heck didn't you step in and shut down the questioning of your gf?", "\u201cNot sure why my mom decided to share that sensitive topic.\u201d\n\nSo why don\u2019t you ASK HER?\n\n\u201cI also believe my mom shouldn\u2019t have asked her for help.\u201d\n\nSo why don\u2019t you TELL HER?\n\nThis is exactly what your girlfriend is wanting to sort out, and you\u2019ve just confirmed you agree.

I often ask people I want to open up to to help me away from the group.", "NTA. In many cultures, asking for help is seen as acceptance into a family. People usually ask family members to help out instead of strangers, so I get it when you see this as bonding time between your mum & gf.  The wrong thing your mom did was share your gf story to someone else who then went out of their way to ask intrusive questions. You could have put a stop to it but failed to do it at the time. Just learn from this and move on.", "you saw it as her bonding\u2026.? what. over your gf\u2019s (you know, the person you\u2019re supposed to love & care about) dead mother? how is that a bonding experience? it just sounded like she wanted something to talk abt.

No way the gf should be helping while OP sits on his ass.", "Sure, but that is ours and is not to be put on other people.  My dad died 10 years ago.  Watching a man go from strong and vivid to a shell in a matter of months is still something I can visualize.  Weirldy, occasionally someone will talk about him or someone will speak about cancer and I will burst out crying.  That\u2019s my thing.  It isn\u2019t the fault of the person speaking.  It\u2019s in me and for me to handle.  It\u2019s my grief.\n\nWe are responsible for our own reactions.  People act as if the mere fact that they can identify what triggered a reaction makes that reaction the fault and responsibility of others.  That is so unhealthy.  Our grief is ours to deal with.  I didn\u2019t own my dad or his memory.  Even when I have one of those reactions, it\u2019s in me and no one is trying to hurt me by asking about my dad.  It\u2019s really very selfish to think they would be.  \n\nIt really is my point that is has nothing to do with me or anyone else how she feels.  She needs to stop making it other peoples\u2019 responsibility.  She balming others and then making it her boyfriend\u2019s responsibility to handle it.", "So she just left your girlfriend suffer when you had already told her this would upset your girlfriend??", "Because he is Mumma's boy and he would never say anything to her just because of a third degree Partner. I hope the gdf is an ex- gf now.

Some things could have been done better, sure. But, she\u2019s overreacting about the food thing. Preparing meals is traditionally family bonding time. She doesn\u2019t have a mom. It it were my mom, she would have done the same thing. She tried to give her a sense of family and belonging and attempted to use it as an opportunity to spend time with her and get to know her. His girlfriend doesn\u2019t have to be comfortable with it, but she needs to stop being a child about it and just say she wasn\u2019t comfortable preparing food with his mom. Instead she\u2019s acting like his mom had malicious intent and is trying to get her boyfriend to cover for her immature attitude about the situation. She was probably really triggered by an incredibly rude guest and took it wrong. But it doesn\u2019t change that she needs to reflect on what actually happened here. All of that being said, bad reactions to things don\u2019t make people assholes, and I don\u2019t think his gf is one.
