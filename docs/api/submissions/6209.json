I keep the money in a seperate account as I still haven't decided what to do with it and I didn't want it to go to waste.\n\n\nI noticed my husband constantly bringing up the inheritance money and making countless suggestions as to how I should spend it. Another thing is that he expects me pay for nearly everything the past couple of weeks.\n\n\nFor NYE, My husband and I met up with his family at a restaurant to celebrate. It was going fine until I found out that I was expected to pay for everyone at the table. My husband's mom joked about paying for dinner out of my \" inheritance pocket\" which made me livid but I showed no reaction. Just silently paid for my own food/drinks. Then got up and made my way out of the restaurant. They were shouting after me like a crowd and my husband tried to get me to come back but I drove home.\n\n\nHe got back at 3 a.m yeling at me saying I was pathetic to get up and walk out on him and his family after they *relied* on me to pay for their food and thougt I was gracious enough to do it BUT they were wrong. He said I humiliated him and family and that what I did was an attempt to get back at them for not being able to help mom when she was sick. Not true is all I'm gonna say.\n\n\nHe is mad and is saying that I caused a huge rift between his family and me when it wouldn't have hurt me to pay for the celebratory dinner.\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672594187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100ogg4/aita_for_silently_getting_up_and_walking_out_of/", "score": 36823, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Losing a parent sucks no matter what age you\u2019re at and no amount of money or other inheritance ever takes the sting away.", "A financial windfall and/or death will show peoples true colors.", ">Also definitely foolproof and tamperproof birth control\n\nThis is sound advice for men in relationships with crazy women, but OP is a woman in a relationship with a crazy man. Crazy men won't even bother trying to tamper with birth control because they know that ultimately she's the one getting pregnant, and she holds all the power.", "I feel similarly, unless there are some other major factors the OP hasn't explained. Not looking good here for the marriage, lack of respect.", "Seriously!! Divorce before she ends up having an unfortunate accident like a \"fall down the stairs\"", "Exactly how I feel.  Too many jump to that as an answer which is ridiculous.  However,  it's pretty obvious this guy and his family are users. Disgusting to assume the dinner shout too", "My grandparents were married 72 years, and all it taught us was that it's not worth wasting your life in a miserable relationship for the sake of marital security.", "That's the first thing that crossed my mind.\nThat you even asked means you have work to do. I would have done something else but I'm basically evil.\nBefore you left the restaurant you could have announced loudly to everybody there Can you believe it? My aunt passes away and my husband and his kin suddenly think of me as their bank because I get an inheritance.\n\nI got an inheritance. I didn't lose a brain.\n\n\nGood luck.", "> What I am wondering is why does OP's husband's family know anything at all about what OP inherited?\n\nI don't think it's that unusual. My sister-in-law's grandfather owns a winery, though he leases it out to other producers, as he is about 93 years-old or so. Seeing that he is needs care 24/7 now, I'm not really sure how much time he has left. Anyway, I think it's pretty common for families to talk about retirement accounts or college savings accounts for the kids. I asked my brother and his wife how much his estate is worth, guessing that it's about $15M, and my brother's wife said \"anywhere from $13M-17M. \n\nSo, yeah. My sister-in-law's potential portion of an inheritance (most would go to her parents and her aunt for now anyway) has zero affect on me, but I know all about the details. Unless a person has been hiding money from their family over the years, you'd think most people would know about it one way or another.", "Asking how much money someone left my spouse is something I could imagine myself doing, I will take your words off wisdom and try to live my life like you because you're fucking right.", "The parenting subreddits are the same quality source of outrage.

Idk of this is a reference or your own but it's incredible either way.", "\u201cWe accept the love we think we deserve\u201d", "Sex work is work.", "I am continually baffled that people marry guys like this. Im sure a chuck of it is people who got married when they thought they were adults and were still kids really. \n\nI\u2019m mean who among us didn\u2019t make questionable dating choices in our late teens/ early 20\u2019s?", "Most men don\u2019t bother sharing their relationship woes with anyone at all, too, lest they be made fun of.", "Fucking capitalism", "And \u201cwhen we\u2019re married / have a baby / buy a house he\u2019ll mature and step up.\u201d", "If he didn\u2019t learn to do laundry pre-baby he ain\u2019t going to miraculously start doing laundry post-baby.
