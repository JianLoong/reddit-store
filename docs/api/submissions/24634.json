She's deliberately picking fights with you, (there's absolutely no good reason to tell your girlfriend's dad that you're going to puncture a teacher's tyres, regardless of the dad's job) probably to self justify.

NTA", "NTA. Jenna is not a likeable person. What are you supposed to do, give up your career to gain her approval? It sounds like your daughter is being swayed by Jenna. See if you can talk to your daughter and tell her you love and care for her, and no matter what you will be there for her. However, it isn't fair to ask you to accept Jenna's abuse and complaints \u2014\u00a0especially when they are completely baseless. Your daughter has known you all her life, does she really think Jenna's description of you is fair?", "NTA You don't have to like everyone you meet, especially if they come at you negatively to start with.", "NTA\n\nThe girlfriend is a jerk for sure, but she has your daughter's ear, so try to be extra nice to her. Kill her with kindness until they have a falling out.", "College students suck, I sucked when I was one. So self involved feeling like you invented thoughts that you read and being rude AF in the name of truth. Having a 25 y/o know it all around living off you has to be frustrating.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to not like your daughter's partner for belittling your profession. You wouldn't like it if the partner was a man either. \n\nAnd if what your daughter is saying is true, that you are an asshole who hates lesbians...So Jenna is allowed to hate you because you are a professor, but you can't hate her because she is a lesbian? I mean I hate to say it, but society hates one of those groups more than the other. It is crazy to even type this, but hating one is a little more mainstream (note: just to be clear I support everyone's lifestyle - lesbians and even these \"terrible\" professors Jenna speaks of). I haven't seen like rallies and bills being passed to limit how professors live their lives. I have never heard of this level of displeasure towards professors that you even describe here. Like what an odd hill for Jenna to die on. \n\nBut if your daughter is cool with Jenna hating you over your profession, why can't you hate Jenna over her behavior? The latter seems like a more reasonable reason to hate someone.", "You daughter gf is an asshole and an idiot\u2026\nYour daughter is blinded with love, you need to let her live his love and sooner or later will realize our ridiculous her gf argument and attitude is and will come back to you.\nYou can show her how wrong she is being with an idiot tho\u2026 cause if it was me I would like someone to tell me the truth about someone I\u2019m in love with before it become too serious.. I may hate you now but later I will thank you", "NTA- You can bring up to her how insulting it is for her to claim. Homophobia is the reason for the issues in your relationship with her partner.\n\nAs have you given anything before this relationship any reason to question your support.", "The girlfriend obvious has some unresolved issues that have nothing to do with you whatsoever.  You\u2019re not under any obligation to take her abuse. Maybe it\u2019s time to ask her what happened that she feels like every professor (which obviously is impossible) is exactly the same.  Somebody hurt her. NTA", "NTA at all. My sister and I grew up in very rural Midwest. After school I moved to KC and she moved to NYC. After a year she came out to my mother and I (an atheist and a conservative Christian) and eventually our entire family. To my surprise everyone was happy for her to come out and everyone made sure to let her know it didn\u2019t change a thing. HOWEVER she dated and brought home a gf that was a NYC lifer and had ZERO acceptance of anything outside the NYC zeitgeist. I get that the Midwest is a different place but my goodness she was rough. Was never mean to me but I constantly heard her make insulting remarks about Midwest life and how shitty our food was and that everywhere was too hot. Extremely condescending to people that let her stay at a house for 2 weeks for free. Anyway, any time we would say she was acting like a jerk to my sister she would tell my sister we were all uneducated homophobes. Which wasn\u2019t true or kind or a smart thing to state.", "Yeah if someone constantly attacks your profession, you have every right to dislike them.", "[removed]", "This was my first thought. Sounds like she\u2019s trying to put distance between OP and her daughter. This is usually the first step towards some form of abusive relationship.", "I mostly agree with you but I'd like to point out that expressed intentions of tire damage are typically hyperbole. I've heard that from dozens of people, who have never even once gone on to act it out as far as I can tell.", "I agree with all of this but with one caveat about killing her with kindness: that shouldn\u2019t mean tolerating disrespect. OP should not allow this woman to call her names in her own house. Politely but firmly shut that down.", "[removed]", "Tell it to assholes like Ezra Miller that do use it as a statues and a shield. And yes, it is a statues now for social media types. Being LGTBQ is now the \"in\" thing. Reminds me of the political lesbians in the 70's who weren't really lesbians but wanted to be in the movement. Weird shit humans do to \"fit in\".\n\nAnd yes, it is common enough that people are starting to see it, so common it happens in Brazil now.", "100% NTA. The world is full of truly unlikeable people, and Jenna seems to be one of them. More to the point, she seems to be one of those people who strives to be unlikeable, so she can play victim ('this person doesn't like me because I'm \\[insert appropriate marginalized group here\\]'). It serves the need to feel persecuted so they can in turn feel righteous. Worse yet, it sounds like she's infecting your daughter with this mindset. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about it other than continue to support Alice from a distance, and wait for the relationship to hopefully end. Any attempts to win Alice back over, or placate Jenna will quite probably be twisted into a being manipulation tactic, and rejected.", "NTA Let Alice know that I too don't like Jenna.", "Two things can exist at once. Jenna can be an asshole and a lesbian. And you simply not like her because she\u2019s an asshole. NTA", "As a Father I feel it is your responsibility to set an example of how to interact with people with opposing opinions.  \n\nShe is 23. If she isn't respecting your home or your space, I would politely explain that as an adult you have the right to hold a conversation about her behaviour. \n\nI'd tell this young lady she is welcome in your home and family, but is also expected to treat you like family. Family doesn't act like that. \n\nUltimately\n\nNTA - but responsible for setting an example in face of a difficult interpersonal situation. \n\nYou don't sound like a bad person or dad. This isn't fair to you, but show how you would want to be respected", "You're playing a game of cards where you are destined to lose.  Just stop playing.", "NTA. You not liking has nothing to do with her being gay, she is an asshole and treats you like shit. She judges you based on either bad experiences she has had or something idea she has in her head and it is totally unfair to you.", "NTA\n\nJenna is disrespectful. Although I disagree with her reasoning, she's free to dislike your profession. However she made her point long ago, so there is no need to continue the criticism. She seems to prefer to blame others for her own failures. As for your daughter I'm afraid that like many of us, she is unreasonable where love is concerned. Maybe just give her some time to cool off and then explain again why you dislike her.", "I am going to be controversial and brave and say very soft NAH with a dose of Jenna is TA. \n\nShe obviously is taking lots of her personal problems with her own (probably terrible) experiences being a queer woman coming up in school. These are obviously her issues and not your problem, but clearly her trust in the whole system is broken. It's not fair that she's taking that out on you. \n\nUnderstandably, your discomfort with her discomfort-turned-animosity has become you disliking her. But to keep your daughter in your life you *will* have to kill this gyal with kindness. Remembering that her issue isn't actually with you but with \"the system\" might help to separate the asshole from the person.", "NTA. Couldn\u2019t imagine arguing with and shitting on my partner\u2019s parent like that! I also couldn\u2019t imagine putting up with my partner treating my mother that way, with total and flippant disrespect. It would be break up time for me for sure.", "An AH is an AH, no matter the race, gender, or sexuality.

NTA, and I wish you luck in talking things out with Alice!", "What did the professor do to make her think she was being singled out for her sexuality?  That makes no sense at all.  Sometimes you don't like people for a variety of reasons.  Sometimes there's just 'something' about them you don't like, w/o knowing what it is.  That seems to be your opinion of Jenna.  It's a shame your daughter can't see that.  NTAH.", "NTA\n\nThis girl sounds in need of massive therapy", "For real. And you need to point out Jenna is doing the same thing your daughter is accusing you of. Jenna hates you because you are a professor even though not all professors are terrible. Same with gay folks.
