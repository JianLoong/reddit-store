She is obviously very immature, yet you are taking it personally and in getting into arguments with her you are really just reinforcing her attitude.

And out of curiosity, how are you going to feel if she ever damages something of yours when she's mad at you for something?  Lets be honest here, if you had a friend who's partner said things like this, you'd be warning them about the red flags, wouldn't you?\"", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't sound particularly likeable", "NTA. \n\nCod psychology moment - Jenna probably regards herself as extremely intelligent and thought she'd be way above the other students in her course. But it's not going to plan and so she's looking a for a reason for why she's doing badly on multiple courses. Easy answer, the system's biased against her. She's deliberately picking fights with you, (there's absolutely no good reason to tell your girlfriend's dad that you're going to puncture a teacher's tyres, regardless of the dad's job) probably to self justify. You argue against her, so you're an arsehole, proving professors are arseholes. \n\nThe uncomfortable fact is that you're going to have to stop responding to the provocation or you could damage your relationship with your daughter. Trust that Alice will come to her senses and in the meantime nod and smile and say 'that must be very difficult for you'. Either Jenna will give up trying to provoke you or she'll escalate to the point it's unavoidably clear to Alice she's the problem.\n\nIt's difficult to watch as a parent, but sometimes your kids are going to make stupid decisions and you just gotta let them learn their lesson", "NTA, but tread carefully. As others have said, she's trying to drive a wedge between you and your daughter. Your disapproval of Jenna is entirely justified because she seems like bad news. But expressing that disapproval will only propel Alice towards Jenna and gives them this \"forbidden love\" dynamic, where you are cast as the villain. Give Alice a bit of space while still checking in and letting her know you care. Kill Jenna with kindness when you do see her. That way, neither of them has an excuse to start fights with you. Jenna seems immature and unstable so it's just a matter of time before she starts upsetting Alice.", "Abusers prime mission is to isolate their victims from any support system.\n\nStudy up on 'grey rocking' Prof.\n\nLearn it, live it \n\nYWBTA if you let the GF drive you any your daughter apart", "NTA.

GF is though.", "\"Jenna expressed a desire to puncture the tire of a professor\"\n\nWhat kind of hot head slashes tires?  Alice should see this is as a huge red flag.  Jenna is assuming this professor wronged her, and she's quick to consider such drastic illegal actions?  Doesn't Alice consider the possibility that Jenna could seek the same type of retribution against her in the future?  That being said, the more you protest against Jenna the more likely your daughter will be to defend her.  If I were you, I would allow no negative talk about Jenna to ever leave my lips.  I would generally try to avoid talking about her, but when the subject comes up I would be pleasant as pie.  As a parent I personally would not care who my daughter chose to love - as long as they were loved and respected, and that person was a positive influence on her.  It sounds like Jenna is not a positive influence, and does not respect you as her father.  Trust me, if you keep things nice and positive, Alice will feel more comfortable coming to you with issues or venting.  On the flip side if she is having to endure Jenna talking negatively about you, she's going to find herself sticking up for you and being like \"why are you such a jerk about my dad when he is nothing but nice to you?\" and Jenna's negative nancy act will likely wear thin.

Break shit?  Throw shit?", "Ok and? He's not him the one who did this!!! Jenna is clearly trying to provoke and annoy him: he's supportive of his daughter and never did anything against Jenna. Jenna is an adult and should understand that everyone is different, and you cannot judge people based on their profession, background, ethnicity etc, you have to judge people on their behaviours(and his was supportive) and ideas(he tries to make girls take place in a male-dominated field). And also, the fact that she random accused him of being homophobic (wth did he do?!) shows how she doesn't want to have a great relationship with him and tries everything to make him appear as bad to his daughter. OP is NTA, Jenna is either very stupid or TA", "I'm not disagreeing that her professor may be sexist or homophobic; what I'm objecting to is her wanting to puncture his tire as a response. I have offered her advice on what she can do if she feels she has been treated unfairly. Specifically, I informed her that she can file an appeal, and according to university rules, her tests would have to be regraded by a committee of three other professors. She just dismissed this suggestion, claiming that the system is rigged and that it wouldn't change anything and continue to argue with me", ">they more than likely may have failed her due to her sexuality and or gender\n\nGiven the fact that we already know Jenna defaults to accusations of sexism/homophobia when it's unwarranted, I'd be willing to bet money that that professor failed her because of her subpar work, not because of her sexuality or gender.", "I think you commented on the wrong post \ud83d\ude02", "What?", "She's attacking him. An adult shouldn't attack people basing on their job, ethnicity, etc. And also, why does she need to complain about this EVERYTIME? she clearly doesn't want to have a great relationship with him", "To be fair, it\u2019d fit into 60% of the other posts \ud83d\ude06", "Attacked *her*."]}
