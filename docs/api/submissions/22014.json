Most are male but one is a female who according to him doesn\u2019t like me very much. \n\nIt took a long while for him to make me his girlfriend. I asked him a few times about where the relationship was going as we met up pretty much everyday and I was sleeping at his house often. He\u2019d constantly tell me he\u2019s not ready to officially be in a relationship, he doesn\u2019t want to put a label on us and that he wanted to take things slow. \n\nAfter around 6 or 7 months I asked again and same answer. He\u2019s only just made me his girlfriend finally but things seem off. He won\u2019t ever show me on his social media and everytime we hang out, his friend - we\u2019ll call her Morgan, calls him constantly. I confronted him about it nicely and he looked confused, saying it\u2019s weird because she never calls him, only when we\u2019re together she does. I told him to pick up the phone but he refused.\n\nOne day I noticed a pair of thongs halfway hidden under his bed. I\u2019m pretty sure they weren\u2019t there before as they were under the side I slept. I asked him about it and he said they were his mothers and that the laundry gets mixed up a lot of the time. He even got his mother to back up this and he lashed out at me about accusing him. Making me feel guilty and crazy. I once got my period and asked to borrow a pad from her. She told me to go into her underwear drawer to get one and there were no thongs at all..\n\nOne night I went over to his and there was a purple lipstick tube on his dresser all of a sudden. (She wears bright purple lipstick) He sighed when he noticed me looking at it and told me that when he was smoking weed with her in his car she left it in there, and him being high out of his mind he brought it up to his room without thinking. He told me not to go off on him about it and so I felt as though I couldn\u2019t as I\u2019d already felt guilty over the thong thing. \n\nI found out he took her to a theme park, just her and him when he said he was going with his male friend. He also took her to London for the day with him a week before he took me. Claiming he didn\u2019t tell me because he knows how I get.\n\nRecently I found a a hair tie in his room just on the floor along with a piece of highlighter from a highlighting compact. He claimed they were mine and that I was being ridiculous now as I confronted him about it as I knew deep down they weren\u2019t mine. I sometimes bring my makeup along and the hair tie was the same colour as ones I use but I don\u2019t ever leave things at his like that. Especially just on the floor. He lashed out at me with hurtful words and disappeared downstairs. After a few minutes he said his mum wanted to talk to me. She spoke to me in private and said that if I keep accusing her son he isn\u2019t going to want to be with me and that I need to stop. I apologised hugely and since then I don\u2019t know whether I was just being crazy or overly paranoid.

He refused to make you his girlfriend for more than *half a year*. I don't know why he finally caved, but it's pretty obvious that he doesn't care much about you, or being exclusive with you. Y T A to yourself if you continue to be his girlfriend.", "I'm sorry but those are some gigantic neon signs pointing right to cheating.\n\n So first off you should leave him. Even if he's not cheating, I don't think he values you as a partner. If he did, he'd leave no doubt that he wasn't cheating. Not to mention the constant gaslighting trying to convince you the hair tie was yours, the lipstick just happened to be brought in absentmindedly, and the thong was his mom's (if it was his mom's thong a. Ew it was in his bedroom and he did not care and b. why was it just stuffed halfway under the bed and not promptly given to his mom when he sorted his laundry. I'm betting it wasn't his mom's) and even getting his mom to go \"ohh you need to stop accusing him otherwise he won't want to date you\" maybe he should stop giving you valid reasons to accuse him", "NTA. As a male I\u2019m gonna be honest with you. He\u2019s cheating on you and you need to find someone who actually wants you cuz as I\u2019m reading this it seems like he\u2019s not that interested in the relationship. I mean you said it took 6-7 months of you asking where the relationship is going? And why is he getting his mum involved?", "NTA - Seriously why do you want to be with him so bad. He clearly wasn\u2019t invested in you from the beginning. Move on and find someone worth your time.", "Honey, he only made you his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d to make you stop asking him questions. He\u2019s keeping you on the side, he never wanted to be committed because he wants to keep sleeping around. He is not faithful. Save yourself the heartache of continuing this relationship and continuing developing feelings. NTA. but please leave. He\u2019s not worth your time. You don\u2019t deserve to be gaslit and lied to.", "NTA, you might be his side chick. You deserve better. Waaaay better.", "NTA Dump him he is obviously cheating.", "Wow. Actual gaslighting. \n\nSave yourself the time, heartache and embarrassment  and just leave. Like now.", "NTA - something definately seems off, and wtf is he doing getting his *mother* to tell you off?", "NTA \n\nHe's probably cheating with Morgan. But even if he wasn't, he obviously holds her in higher regard than you, to the extent that he's treated her to days out and lied about it, and made excuses for why her things keep turning up in his room. \n\nIt's worrying that he's tried to convince you that items you know aren't yours belong to you, and that he's lashed out at you verbally about it-- that's called gaslighting, and people don't do that when they're in healthy relationships and have nothing to hide.\n\nYou're only 18 so it's a guarantee that this relationship isn't going to last long, even if you want it to. Your boyfriend isn't as interested in you as he is in Morgan, and he's making you feel like you're the bad person for voicing your fears and concerns.\n\nIt would be better for you to leave this relationship now so you don't end up running around after your boyfriend for months or even years, when he doesn't think you're worth the effort. \n\nHe tried to let you know he wasn't interested when he said he didn't want to label your relationship. You didn't get the hint, and probably ignored your misgivings even as you were pushing him for months to make you his girlfriend, because you feel more for him than he feels for you.\n\nSo take the hint now: you might be in a relationship, but he's in a situationship that he's too cowardly to back out of. His mother is enabling his bad behaviour towards you, and she probably knows about Morgan. \n\nNone of these people care that you're hurting now, and are going to be even more hurt when this relationship ends. So for your own sake, think seriously about getting out of it now and sparing yourself even more heartache.", "NTA when his excuses are poor, his mum is covering for him and you see there are way too many red flags! Run fast and find someone else that will treat you better!", "NTA - all the excuses for the \"clues\" aside, he straight up lied to you about who he was going to the theme park with.  Relationships are about trust.  Are you ever going to be able to truly trust this guy again?", "NTA\n\nOne is acceptable 3 items is just either incredibly bad luck or suspicion. \n\n>I found out he took her to a theme park, just her and him when he said he was going with his male friend. He also took her to London for the day with him a week before he took me. Claiming he didn\u2019t tell me because he knows how I get.\n\nThis is not how you make your partner feel valued. This guy.... spoils his friend who you know you have a problem with... and then proceeds to blame you essentially. You are being gaslight.", "Definitely not the asshole but your boyfriend is. He's using you for some reason. I'm sure you can find a guy that will treat you better than he is.", "NTA, but I think you're being used.  This guy is calling you his girlfriend because you kept pestering him about it.  I'm betting he's got a thing for Morgan, but she's leading him around by the nose.  If she decided she wanted him as her boyfriend, he'd drop you like a bad habit.", "NTA. I mean what's up with all that stuff? Is he looking to get caught and just wants to gaslight you?", "NTA Has he made you his girlfriend since all of this stuff happened? Because that's a pretty low thing to do to try and keep you around. The fact it's taken this long, his lies and his hugely defensive behaviour over your suspicions are red flags. Time to bail.", "NTA. Both you and Morgan are the same person of the opposite sides of the coin. And Morgan seems to be showing you she\u2019s there and will keep sleeping with him.\n\nYou deserve better than that. A good partner doesn\u2019t treat someone they care about that way. He told you who he was. Believe him. You accepting this situationship says you accept his behavior and treatment. \n\nThe only solution is to leave this, bc you are the only one in the relationship.", "You\u2019re NTA but geeze, you\u2019re being a fool. \n\nI\u2019m sure a plethora of folks will tell you to google gaslighting, You should. \n\nYou\u2019re not his girlfriend, he just let you use the label to shut you up. \n\nHe\u2019s convincing you to not trust yourself, that gut feeling? It\u2019s your lizard brain shouting at you. \n\nMove on and find someone who deserves you.", "Hey, please listen to all the comments.\n\nThe situation is as clear as day! Time will pass and you will see how ridiculous it was. You are being gaslighted and used, you are convenient. There are obvious signs that he is cheating but him telling you this is not the case is sufficient to trust him again? Excuse me?\n\nDear OP, you will learn to respect yourself and as a consequence, you won't tolerate such bullshit anymore. I wish you all the best and get out if this relationship asap.", "That\u2019s a lot of pretty suspicious clues and lying that he went with other friends to take her to theme park is really weird. Just let a few weeks go by like nothings wrong and confront him out of nowhere to look thru his phone an if he doesn\u2019t let you it\u2019s pretty obvious what\u2019s happening an he will probably say ur insane lol.", "ESH\n\nYou should have realized months ago that this dude doesn't want to be in a committed relationship with you. Damn, girl, you needed to pressure and nearly forcing him to \"make you his gf\" - show a little selfrespect and don't throw yourself at ppl like this. Are you really so desperate?\n\nYour bf is cheating on you bc he never ended his fwb situation with his friend - they are sleeping together longer than you even know him and thats exactly the reason he didn't want to commit till you made him to. Sure he could have said no, but at some point you wouldn't have been willing to sleep with him anymore and for him having at least two different women he can choose from for having sex was more important than not wanting to commit to you. \n\nYou are not his gf bc he loves you, he just has to call you his gf so you are willing to sleep with him.
