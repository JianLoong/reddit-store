My MIL is very close to them but not as close to me, but she\u2019s kind and supported me a lot when my husband passed away some years ago. Recently my MIL asked if she could stay for a few months to help take care of my 4YO while I work, because the daycare cost has been a strain on my budget. (I work as a teacher so I was home for the summer, so it was okay until now.) \n\nI was really happy and I said of course she could, the kids were also happy as they love having their grandma around. She\u2019s been here for a few weeks now. In the past when she has visited, the house rules go out the window, and I was okay with it. Because she only stays for a few days, and it\u2019s like a holiday for my kids. She spoils them and lets them stay up super late and eat loads of sweets. I don\u2019t mind, I think it\u2019s lovely that they get that special grandma love, and the rules can be relaxed sometimes. \n\nBut because she\u2019s going to be staying for a long time now, I asked her if she could please respect my rules for my kids. I\u2019m not overly strict. The 8 YO has to be in bed by 9:30, the 4 YO by 8:00. They can watch TV for half an hour on school days. Dessert after dinner. The 8 YO has to be back by 7 pm if he wants to visit his neighborhood friends\u2019 houses. Homework before TV.\n\nMy MIL said she would follow these rules, but when i\u2019m not around she lets the boys do basically whatever they want, and she tells them to keep it a secret from me. This bothers me, as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that she paints me as the \u201cmean mom\u201d. She let my 4 YO eat an entire box of cookies and when I told him off, she told him it\u2019s okay let mom yell. \n\nI talked to my MIL about this afterward. I said that if she wants to help me parent my kids, we have to agree on rules and she can\u2019t just be the \u201cnice one\u201d. She said that\u2019s not fair, because I don\u2019t consider her opinions. I think she\u2019s biased because she\u2019s the grandma. She was plenty strict with me. So I told her if she can\u2019t respect my rules she needs to leave. Now she\u2019s upset because she says I\u2019m being ungrateful and unfair. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1693125326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162kvdv/aita_for_telling_my_mil_she_cant_stay_in_my_house/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s their grandma, not your coparent. You\u2019re allowed to set the rules. They don\u2019t sound overly strict, they sound like reasonable boundaries.
