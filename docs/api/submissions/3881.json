What he could have done was reach out when he was free to get on the same page.\nThe brother in law's time also doesn't matter here. He was offered an out, in that OP offered to take an Uber.  If they didn't want to get ice cream, BiL could have left at that, or if the ice cream place was on the way, dropped off OP.  Unless the ice cream place is in a literal war zone that somehow doesn't include the airport or home, there's no reason to suggest that the BiL needed to stay in case \"something happened.\" Presumably the OP is an adult and capable of eating ice cream.  As far as the 2 hours, it's hard to say if that's a long time for the ice cream detour.
