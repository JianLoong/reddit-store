What he could have done was reach out when he was free to get on the same page.\nThe brother in law's time also doesn't matter here. He was offered an out, in that OP offered to take an Uber.  If they didn't want to get ice cream, BiL could have left at that, or if the ice cream place was on the way, dropped off OP.  Unless the ice cream place is in a literal war zone that somehow doesn't include the airport or home, there's no reason to suggest that the BiL needed to stay in case \"something happened.\" Presumably the OP is an adult and capable of eating ice cream.  As far as the 2 hours, it's hard to say if that's a long time for the ice cream detour.

In larger, more heavily trafficked metro areas - and London would definitely count as that - I could see it taking significantly longer.\n\n\nSo, even if the ice cream stop was literally right along the way, and there were only in there 10 - 15 minutes, 2 hours is completely reasonable (in my experience); if OP's husband has no idea how much time each of those parts take, and add up to in total, that's not OPs fault (and she says that almost all of the 2 hours was driving, which I find perfectly believable).", "From her comments.

How important was this get together? Were both of you aware of how this get together was important?** You seem rather blind to how your Brother in law fit into this situation and how ..  and I don't say this just to be insulting.. rude your behaviour was toward him. [[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbuvd1/aita_for_going_to_get_ice_cream_instead_of_going/iytif42/)] [[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbuvd1/aita_for_going_to_get_ice_cream_instead_of_going/iytjcmm/?context=3)] [[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbuvd1/aita_for_going_to_get_ice_cream_instead_of_going/iytlih4/)]. Trying to shuff it off by saying he didn't have to drive you doesn't cut it. You're the ahole for that alone. Unless there's some sort of prior antagonistic relationship with your husband's brother (and if so that's fine I can respect that) then he didn't deserve to have his time and effort to see you home safely disrespected like that. That's not about what dangers are and are not in this modern world where you can get a taxi with your phone. It's about respecting the effort he made to come get you.\n\nAs for the thing with your husband? Unlike a lot of the posts.. I don't have enough information to make a judgement call. I've read your responses and they  do provide a degree of insight into why you felt you wanted to do what you did but they don't actually justify it. As some people have pointed out it's very confusing why neither of you bothered to communicate. It seems like maybe this was supposed to be a surprise and that's why he wasn't talking to you but to his brother but you haven't mentioned anything about that clearly. He shouldn't be upset with his brother for taking you where you wanted to go. This is simply between you and him and there just simply isn't enough information to understand why this happened. You know, but based on the tone of some of your replies (though to be fair I can't imagine some of the seething responses you're getting), I'm not sure you are capable of seeing yourself as in the wrong.\n\nI have to **refuse** to vote. Any of the vote classifications could be true here I can't rule out any of them but I can rule with any of them either. You are entitled to [your feelings](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbuvd1/aita_for_going_to_get_ice_cream_instead_of_going/iytfs1s/). Maybe you were genuinely upset. But that doesn't necessarily mean you should have done what you did.\n\n\n\\* - even that there seems to be debate on if your trip took you two hours total to get home or if it ADDED two hours to your trip home. I assumed the former but again debate seem to be saying that rather than a 90 minute trip home you had a 120 minute trip home.

My entire point is that we went to the place we normally go to and because of traffic it took us around 1h20m to get there. We were there for around 30m and then the drive home was about 1h.

Even if I had gone to the first one I saw I STILL would\u2019ve gotten home later than if we never went because of traffic.\n\nSo from that, total travel time with ice cream stop was 2h50m.

Based off OPs other comments with more info, this is an issue between OP and husband (and probably not the first one) and they need to not drag others into the middle of it. On top of that, husband texted OP (at least once) to let them know the situation. The breakdown of communication is only going one way here.

He bailed on her after a month apart? Sends his passive aggressive brother to pick her up? Doesn't bother to mention he is home but instead says \"message me when you get home\"? Good Lord.
