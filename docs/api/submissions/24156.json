{"id": 24156, "submission_id": "15lb0ic", "title": "WIBTA for forcing my friend to pay more for a hotel after she was being hostile about inviting someone?", "selftext": "I had plans to go on a trip with my friend, a mutual friend of ours, and my friend\u2019s boyfriend. For several months, that was the plan. Then my friend broke up with her boyfriend and started immediately seeing someone else who none of us had met. She was instantly very pushy about us accepting this guy on the trip.\n\nI was not ok with it. I did not want to go on an international trip I\u2019d waited months for with some guy I don\u2019t know at all. A trip of that type I want people I can trust and want to be in close quarters with. My friend was very hostile when I voiced my discomfort. Since she had booked the room on her credit card, she kept saying \u201cno me no room\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t allow my new guy along, I can pull the plug on everyone and you won\u2019t be able to rebook somewhere for that price\u201d. I confronted her about her attitude and she said she\u2019s highly stressed from work so a bit snappy but maintained that this guy is coming or the trip is off.\n\nAfter talking to the guy on the phone briefly, I felt even worse about him coming. He did not rub me the right way at all and seemed to want to drink and party a ton on the trip when we had all agreed this was going to be a Sightseeing trip, not some party marathon. At this point, I talked to my other friend and we scrambled a bit and found a far less nice but still doable hotel to stay in for similar price to what we would have been paying to split a room with the other two. I want to book it and tell my friend and her new partner that they\u2019re on their own to pay for the room. \n\nThe only reason I feel bad about doing this is because I don\u2019t think she can get a full refund on all of the booking now as that window has finally passed after all her threatening and I doubt she\u2019ll be able to find a similar room in time as we struggled for hours to find our replacement room. So she may be out for a lot of money sharing that room with only one other person rather than three. The main reason I want to book the other room is so my and my other friend\u2019s trip doesn\u2019t get bogged down by this stranger who has different ideas about what he wants (we strongly don\u2019t want some hungover person ruining sightseeing plans) and so my friend can\u2019t keep trying to use the room as leverage. I\u2019m just worried in doing this we will totally make it impossible for her to afford the trip. WIBTA? Please don\u2019t repost. This is not a looking for validation post or anything of that sort, I have felt so manipulated in this situation that I honestly don\u2019t know what is right for me to do at this point.", "created_utc": 1691480059, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lb0ic/wibta_for_forcing_my_friend_to_pay_more_for_a/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Book your own hotel, let her reap the consequences of her actions. If she asks why tell her you considered her proposal and decided to rebook yourself.", "NTA- your friend is bullying you into sharing a room with a stranger and holding your trip hostage.  Any extra costs she incurs are of her own doing.  \n\nPrioritize your own comfort, and far more importantly -your own safety, and book the separate room.  You are definitely not the asshole here.", "Absolutely go ahead and book the other room with your sightseer friend. Do it *now*.\n\nIf your friend with the credit card wants her new lover to go so *so* very much that he is *going* wether you like it or not \u2026 Oh, and she said she could \u201cpull the plug\u201d on the whole thing and you couldn\u2019t rebook for the same price? Lol. Call her bluff. \n\nIf she can\u2019t afford the trip without you, well, maybe the new BF can make up the difference. Or maybe he can\u2019t, and that sucks for her. But she shouldn\u2019t have put you all in this situation in the first place. NTA", "NTA.  Book the new room, and let her know ASAP once you've done so.  That maximizes her ability to make changes / find other people to vacation with.  I wouldn't travel with her at this point even if she agrees the guy won't come, bc she's likely to be unpleasant.", "NTA\n\nFriends don\u2019t hold others friends to ransom like this. She\u2019s not your friend, she\u2019s someone you were friendly with.\n\nBook your new room. Enjoy your trip. I\u2019d suggest blocking her, and changing your sightseeing itinerary, so she can\u2019t harass you on your trip.", "NTA. Tell her \"I understand that it's important to you for Fred to be on this trip, but it's also important for us to feel safe in our hotel room and not be with a man we don't know. To resolve this I've booked another hotel room for me and other friend. I'm still totally down to meet up for lunch and get to know Fred better during the trip, if you're down too you know where to reach me.\"  \n\n\nOr if you're done with the friend entirely leave off the last sentence :D", "NTA. She acted in bad faith by using her room reservation as a threat. The fact that you did not give in to her threat does not make you an AH, regardless of whether the threat backfires on her.", "NTA not only did your friend use the room booking as a threat against you, she is expecting you to sleep in the same room as her new boyfriend, a stranger to you\u2026.no thanks", "YWNBTA   Keep your hotels separate and have a wonderful time!", "NTA. Book your room and enjoy your trip. Your friend only has herself to blame by trying to foist a stanger on the rest of the group at this stage. Her desire to include this new guy doesn't trump others' need to be comfortable.", "NTA. Both of your friends sound like jerks. You had no say in him coming in the first place, so you choosing to separate yourself was reasonable. You wanted to enjoy yourself more, you were just forcing a compromise.", "NTA. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not want to travel with someone you don\u2019t know well or get along with. She shouldn\u2019t have presented it in such a forceful way and ideally should have tried to work to find a mutually agreeable choice to bring along instead if you weren\u2019t comfortable with her new boyfriend.", "NTA I only think this because it is your trip as much as hers. You have tried to talk with your friend, and she is staunch in her desire to include the new guy, which is fine, but not what you signed up for. The only thing I think is reasonable is for you and the others on the trip to think about how this will change your enjoyment level. Will this issue continue to change the tenor and tension level, and is it going to ruin your enjoyment. If yes, what will it take for you to feel comfortable with your plans again?", "Not your problem, and NTA. She's being a MASSIVE AH.", "NTA. Book the new room. Phone your friend and say that her boyfriend is not welcome. When she says \u201cno bf, no room\u201d say fine, we\u2019ll make alternative arrangements.", "NTA. She said \u201cno me, no room.\u201d All you\u2019re doing is taking her up on her offer. Probably won\u2019t be able to salvage this friendship though, but that might not be such a bad thing.", "NTA, and she's not a friend.", "NTA.  She was the one who gave you an ultimatum.  Before you book a new hotel, though, look on the comparison websites for hotels (like Trivago).  They compare other websites and give you the best deal for the hotels you are interested in.  Best of luck.", "Fuck your friend. Book rooms for the rest of you. She threatened you with no room if you don't accept him, so do what you need to do and enjoy the trip you planned and have been waiting for. Sorry but your friend is either terrified of not having a man or is just entitled", "do it, from what I read through this she is enforcing a man you DO NOT know to come with you on a trip, I won\u2019t be surprised if someone terrible happens while your all inside the one she\u2019s in, put your safety first and run with your gut there might be a bump with you friendship but your best bet is to screen shout all conversations for now on and record, I have a feeling she trying to change your plans to show off to her new boyfriend more than she wants to be with her life friends. So NTA go with your gut always trust your guts", "NTA. You shouldn't have to pay for a holiday where you're going to be uncomfortable due to someone coming who wasn't initially invited. You tried to talk to her and be reasonable, but she won't budge. Tell her you're sorry but she gave you no choice.", "NTA if it were me I would book the hotel and then ditch them as soon as the plane lands.\n\nI do not appreciate or tolerate manipulation of any sort.\n\nIf someone pulled that they would be dead to me.", "No me no room. She called your bluff. Are you going to fold? NTA", "NTA better safe than sorry and the ah ultimatum", "NTA\n\nShe told you \n\n>\u201cno me no room\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t allow my new guy along, I can pull the plug on everyone\n\nAnd you just take her offer and thats exactly how i would phrase it. \"You told us either this guy is staying in the same room or there will be no room for me and my friend. We would like to take you up on this offer and book a different room for us. Don't worry about the price, we will manage to find something and you and your new bf can keep the room you booked.\"\n\nWorst case she will just cancel and you lose a friend. But for this friend her new bf is more important anyway than your friendship, like her threats proove, so i don't think you will lose a lot here.", "NTA - you voiced your concerns and rather then trying to hear them and find a compromise or an understanding she basically held the room over your head.\nThis isn\u2019t a night out or a lunch and you\u2019re refusing to give him a chance, going on a holiday with friends especially an overseas one is a big deal and not something you should do with someone you\u2019ve never met or even known for a month. \nI\u2019d say book the room but know you\u2019ve probably lost the friendship (not sure id say it\u2019s a loss if that\u2019s how your friend acts when you voice a concern) but I\u2019d also say it\u2019s likely you\u2019d have lost the friendship on the trip because of these concerns or your friends attitude anyway. \n\nThis is speaking as someone who has travelled with long term friends and definitely felt the stress of being enclosed with eachother and needing space once we got home and we didn\u2019t even have any major issues.", "NTA  You said no boyfriend. She said you couldn't stay in the room if you didn't want BF there so you got your own. You only did what she wanted.", "I\u2019m going to buck the trend here and say, mildly, ESH, borderline N A H. Which one probably depends on information you didn\u2019t provide, like everyone\u2019s age and sex, the length of the trip, and the planned sleeping arrangements. There\u2019s a different vibe if you and your friend are men in their late 20s in a 2 bedroom suite and just sharing a bathroom, or women in your early 20s and expected to all share sleeping bags in a yurt with a guy you just met.\n\nLook at this from your friend\u2019s point of view. Nobody plans to split up with a long term partner, she had a trip planned for two, she has a boyfriend she\u2019s comfortable enough with to go on the trip with, and if she went solo she\u2019d be out the cost of her plus one even though she has a plus one she could bring along. I can see why this is an obvious solution to her.\n\nPart of being friends is giving your friends\u2019 significant others a fair chance. From her perspective, she is excited about this guy and this new relationship, and it probably feels like you are just rejecting him after talking to him on the phone for five minutes: \u201cEh, your new guy sounds like an asshole frat boy, dump him or we\u2019re out.\u201d From your description it does sound like she wasn\u2019t listening to your concerns at all and just threatening to kick you out of the room instead, which makes her kind of an AH.\n\nOn the other hand, I think you were a bit of an AH here too. Again, how much depends on the details of the trip. I might be more sympathetic if your post sounded more like you were concerned about your personal safety or privacy, or if there were specific details that would make this a particularly close quarters trip. But the things you focus on were that you didn\u2019t immediately vibe with the guy on the phone and you were worried he might want to party too much, and those seem like kind of petty reasons to blow up a trip other people had also presumably spent a lot of time and money on already. Putting up with the people your friends are dating is part of friendship, and if there were any serious red flags about this guy you would have posted them. And if you and your friend want to go sightseeing and she and her boyfriend want to stay in the hotel hung over, that seems like a pretty easy to solve conflict: you go sightseeing, they sleep in.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019d be an AH to be disappointed, I just think, unless there\u2019s more to the story, that refusing to go on the trip or demanding that she still pay for two people but not be able to bring her boyfriend along seems like an overreaction.", "Is it worth losing that friend? Because you might lose her as friend if you book your own thing. I mean is he really that bad? He doesnt have to follow you everywhere also.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
