{"id": 24156, "submission_id": "15lb0ic", "title": "WIBTA for forcing my friend to pay more for a hotel after she was being hostile about inviting someone?", "selftext": "I had plans to go on a trip with my friend, a mutual friend of ours, and my friend\u2019s boyfriend. For several months, that was the plan. Then my friend broke up with her boyfriend and started immediately seeing someone else who none of us had met. She was instantly very pushy about us accepting this guy on the trip.\n\nI was not ok with it. I did not want to go on an international trip I\u2019d waited months for with some guy I don\u2019t know at all. A trip of that type I want people I can trust and want to be in close quarters with. My friend was very hostile when I voiced my discomfort. Since she had booked the room on her credit card, she kept saying \u201cno me no room\u201d and \u201cif you don\u2019t allow my new guy along, I can pull the plug on everyone and you won\u2019t be able to rebook somewhere for that price\u201d. I confronted her about her attitude and she said she\u2019s highly stressed from work so a bit snappy but maintained that this guy is coming or the trip is off.\n\nAfter talking to the guy on the phone briefly, I felt even worse about him coming. He did not rub me the right way at all and seemed to want to drink and party a ton on the trip when we had all agreed this was going to be a Sightseeing trip, not some party marathon. At this point, I talked to my other friend and we scrambled a bit and found a far less nice but still doable hotel to stay in for similar price to what we would have been paying to split a room with the other two. I want to book it and tell my friend and her new partner that they\u2019re on their own to pay for the room. \n\nThe only reason I feel bad about doing this is because I don\u2019t think she can get a full refund on all of the booking now as that window has finally passed after all her threatening and I doubt she\u2019ll be able to find a similar room in time as we struggled for hours to find our replacement room. So she may be out for a lot of money sharing that room with only one other person rather than three. The main reason I want to book the other room is so my and my other friend\u2019s trip doesn\u2019t get bogged down by this stranger who has different ideas about what he wants (we strongly don\u2019t want some hungover person ruining sightseeing plans) and so my friend can\u2019t keep trying to use the room as leverage. I\u2019m just worried in doing this we will totally make it impossible for her to afford the trip. WIBTA? Please don\u2019t repost. This is not a looking for validation post or anything of that sort, I have felt so manipulated in this situation that I honestly don\u2019t know what is right for me to do at this point.", "created_utc": 1691480059, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lb0ic/wibta_for_forcing_my_friend_to_pay_more_for_a/", "score": 2515, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't travel with her at this point even if she agrees the guy won't come, bc she's likely to be unpleasant.", "NTA\n\nFriends don\u2019t hold others friends to ransom like this.

To resolve this I've booked another hotel room for me and other friend.

She threatened you with no room if you don't accept him, so do what you need to do and enjoy the trip you planned and have been waiting for.

We would like to take you up on this offer and book a different room for us. Don't worry about the price, we will manage to find something and you and your new bf can keep the room you booked.\"\n\nWorst case she will just cancel and you lose a friend. But for this friend her new bf is more important anyway than your friendship, like her threats proove, so i don't think you will lose a lot here.", "NTA - you voiced your concerns and rather then trying to hear them and find a compromise or an understanding she basically held the room over your head.\nThis isn\u2019t a night out or a lunch and you\u2019re refusing to give him a chance, going on a holiday with friends especially an overseas one is a big deal and not something you should do with someone you\u2019ve never met or even known for a month. \nI\u2019d say book the room but know you\u2019ve probably lost the friendship (not sure id say it\u2019s a loss if that\u2019s how your friend acts when you voice a concern) but I\u2019d also say it\u2019s likely you\u2019d have lost the friendship on the trip because of these concerns or your friends attitude anyway. \n\nThis is speaking as someone who has travelled with long term friends and definitely felt the stress of being enclosed with eachother and needing space once we got home and we didn\u2019t even have any major issues.", "NTA  You said no boyfriend. She said you couldn't stay in the room if you didn't want BF there so you got your own. You only did what she wanted.", "I\u2019m going to buck the trend here and say, mildly, ESH, borderline N A H. Which one probably depends on information you didn\u2019t provide, like everyone\u2019s age and sex, the length of the trip, and the planned sleeping arrangements. There\u2019s a different vibe if you and your friend are men in their late 20s in a 2 bedroom suite and just sharing a bathroom, or women in your early 20s and expected to all share sleeping bags in a yurt with a guy you just met.\n\nLook at this from your friend\u2019s point of view. Nobody plans to split up with a long term partner, she had a trip planned for two, she has a boyfriend she\u2019s comfortable enough with to go on the trip with, and if she went solo she\u2019d be out the cost of her plus one even though she has a plus one she could bring along. I can see why this is an obvious solution to her.\n\nPart of being friends is giving your friends\u2019 significant others a fair chance. From her perspective, she is excited about this guy and this new relationship, and it probably feels like you are just rejecting him after talking to him on the phone for five minutes: \u201cEh, your new guy sounds like an asshole frat boy, dump him or we\u2019re out.\u201d From your description it does sound like she wasn\u2019t listening to your concerns at all and just threatening to kick you out of the room instead, which makes her kind of an AH.\n\nOn the other hand, I think you were a bit of an AH here too. Again, how much depends on the details of the trip. I might be more sympathetic if your post sounded more like you were concerned about your personal safety or privacy, or if there were specific details that would make this a particularly close quarters trip. But the things you focus on were that you didn\u2019t immediately vibe with the guy on the phone and you were worried he might want to party too much, and those seem like kind of petty reasons to blow up a trip other people had also presumably spent a lot of time and money on already. Putting up with the people your friends are dating is part of friendship, and if there were any serious red flags about this guy you would have posted them. And if you and your friend want to go sightseeing and she and her boyfriend want to stay in the hotel hung over, that seems like a pretty easy to solve conflict: you go sightseeing, they sleep in.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019d be an AH to be disappointed, I just think, unless there\u2019s more to the story, that refusing to go on the trip or demanding that she still pay for two people but not be able to bring her boyfriend along seems like an overreaction.", "Is it worth losing that friend? Because you might lose her as friend if you book your own thing. I mean is he really that bad? He doesnt have to follow you everywhere also.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s given you an ultimatum so you need to give her one back, but give her the choice before you take action. \n\nBe specific in that you don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing with him. Her options are that: \n- You all go together without him which is your preferred choice. \n- She transfers the room booking to your name and you go without her.\n- You book your own hotel and she can make her own plans.", "[removed]", "Yes this! Nta", "It's called blackmail and she f-ed around and found out. NTA. The entire trip would be full of self-centered ultimatums.", "Disagree.\n\n'Friend'  has shown her colors.\n\nLeave her to handle her new boy-toy and the COST of it herself.", "Yeah right. She\u2019ll say one thing and then show up with the boyfriend anyway.", "This, BUT....make the new arrangements first, so as she's gloating that you'll have to cave, you can be planning the vacation YOU want quietly.", "That meddling INTERNET for research! ;-)", "Hard disagree. She needs to know how ridiculous she\u2019s being. Expecting two women to share a hotel room with a guy they\u2019ve never met?", "Nta. This happened to me when I was 21. My friend and I booked a holiday together and she rekindled an old relationship just before it and wanted to bring him along for part of our trip. I was adamant that I didn\u2019t want him to come along and essentially for me to be a third wheel. \n\nI was 21 and a pushover so eventually I felt \u201cbad\u201d and gave in to their pleadings. In the end, I should have just kept saying no because it wasn\u2019t pleasant. I had a bad attitude towards it so it was uncomfortable from the start & I was the third wheel on those days he was there. \n\nI either should have said no, or said yes and accepted it without a bad attitude. Instead, I went with the least appropriate option which was to say yes and be angry about it the whole time. \n\nThere was a rift in the friendship after that and we are now 29 and our friendship is ok, but I always wonder what would have happened if we both had of been mature? He shouldn\u2019t have been invited in the first place & I shouldn\u2019t have said yes to something I didn\u2019t want to agree to and then have a bad attitude about saying yes. \n\nSo, I hope this helps your situation. I think the best thing to do from my own experience is to emphasise how uncomfortable you are with her bringing someone new along, and let her know that you\u2019re planning to get your own place. She will either have to accept paying more or not bring him. If she does bring him, try not to feel annoyed the whole time like I did as it only makes it worse. Xxx\n\nEdit- \n\nJust for emphasis, I think she is the one in the wrong though for even putting this on you. It\u2019s completely unfair and it puts you in a situation where you essentially feel forced to agree to to something you don\u2019t want to do. \n\nAlso, boyfriends don\u2019t last forever. My friend isn\u2019t even with that guy anymore so there was all that drama between us for nothing. She doesn\u2019t sound mature but she should understand that your friends should come first since you booked the holiday together.", "If I\u2019ve learned anything from Reddit, it\u2019s that when you are planning a trip, do not fuck around with adding or substituting people without full enthusiastic consent of all parties. It goes down badly on the trip, or before it even starts. NTA", "NTA. \u2018No me, no room\u2019 sounds like she\u2019s not that good of a friend anyway. What a weird way to respond to a situation, she already made weird, by forcing her new/ badly matched boyfriend down your throats.", "NTA. She threatened the trip first. Be prepared for the friendship to end if you bail and leave her holding the bag with the rooms, though.", "NTA do your own thing!", "u/hotelbookingfiasco  Update???", "NTA. Four people sharing a room would be uncomfortable under the best of circumstances but could prove to be absolute hell with someone who does not share your interests or values. Getting a separate room will give you a better vacation than you had originally planned and the two couples can go their separate ways, with the one couple partying all night, every night if they are so inclined. \n\nEnjoy your trip!", "Nta, but this girl does NOT sound like a friend.", "The plans were not made with the new guy.  Your friend says \"No me, no room\"?  Fuck around and find out!  SHE made the threat, you just followed through with it.  NTA\n\nAs much as I AM an asshole, and would LOVE to just say that \\^\\^, life isn't always that easy.  AT the very least, I would give her a phone call before you actually book the other room, and tell her you've found a room.   Either new guy doesn't come, or you book it, and she can do what she likes.  \n\nThings to think about before doing so:\n\nIs it worth it for you to go on the trip, and have her pissed that her new guy isn't along?\n\nIs it worth it for you to go with JUST the mutual friend, and have the first friend pissed she couldn't go, and you feeling bad about it?\n\nIs it worth going with the new guy along, sharing a room, making you uncomfortable, and resenting it the whole time?  At least if you had connecting rooms, you could lock the one in between, and lay down the law, that whatever tours/ sightseeing you're doing will NOT wait.  Either he's up and at 'em or he's left behind to nurse his hangover.\n\nIs it worth losing her friendship?  \n\nIt seems like those are your options.\n\nGood luck!", "So I guess you friend can\u2019t function with out a man? I would suggest that the new relationship needs its own privacy and they should enjoy it. Perhaps you could do a late lunch one day as he will be hung over.", "please do update!", "NTA and thank her for giving you enough time to find other accommodations! \n\nI once had a friend add someone I didn\u2019t know to our room right after we checked-in for a con. We are both female and the person I didn\u2019t know was a male. I was not asked nor warned in time to find alternate accommodations. Thankfully he was chill and nothing happened but that totally ruined the con for me. If I had known earlier I would have found somewhere else to stay. \n\nSo go and enjoy your vacation without worrying about a stranger! You\u2019ll have a much better time.", "NTA. Her attitude sucks. Book your own room and let her deal with the consequences.", "I wouldn't trust someone like the friend after this. I wouldn't put it past her to agree and then - surprise! - look who I brought to the airport!\n\nNTA. Book the other accommodations. Let the ex-friend know she and her boyfriend will have the whole hotel to themselves, and they're free to make their own plans, too.", "NTA\nINFO: when you said she immediately found another guy after dumping her ex-boyfriend, do you mean like a week? Or a month? I\u2019m honestly wondering if she was cheating on her previous boyfriend with this clown and that\u2019s why she picked him up so quickly.\nSorry if I\u2019m reading too much into this, that\u2019s just how my brain works haha", "NTA", "Maybe the new boyfriend should invite two of HIS friends to share the original room. By her own logic, your friend shouldn't have a problem with that. Problem solved!", "NTA at all. Your safety is more important than her getting her money back. Fuck that noise", "NTA- you deserve to be comfortable on your vacation\u2026 she is the one threatening to cancel the trip , so I say BOOK YOUR OWN  ROOM , relax have fun and enjoy the sightseeing!!!", "NTA. Book the room. You don't have to share with a stranger.", "You don't owe people closure or justification. Why expend the effort to resin with her when she's clearly not reasonable?"]}
