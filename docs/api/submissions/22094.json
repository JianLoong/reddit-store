I came through a hellish divorce that left me with nothing. It took me five years to get on my feet. I now have a small business and I provide support to abuse victims. My life is full and fulfilling and I have many years ahead of me to achieve even more. That\u2019s my responsibility to myself. \n\nI would no more have asked my children for support than fly to the moon. That\u2019s not their job or their responsibility. \n\nYour mother is using her victim mentality as a coping strategy. It is not healthy for her or those around her. If you decide to support her now, you will be validating her belief that she\u2019s \u2018owed\u2019 a living.

Not your problem.", "NTA, she\u2019s been feeding off of men in her life all the time and hadn\u2019t been bothered to work until she\u2019d lost it all. Dont ever agree to helping her, she will probably run you dry out of money. Kids aren\u2019t responsible of parents money issues if it\u2019s their own doing especially when she never worked to build herself up simply because she didn\u2019t want to. You also have your own kids to provide for whilst they are still young.", "NTA. Children do not ask to be born. Accordingly, she cannot say, \"I gave birth to you, now you owe me\". She is an adult, you are adults. She has made her life choices and must live with their consequences as you have to as well. You are not responsible for her situation.", "NTA If you don\\`t want to you don\\`t want to. Thats it.", "You and your brothers should get together and make sure that it's crystal clear that you're not going to be supporting her. Whether you do this in person or via a group chat but make sure that she knows that if she quits her job, she's on her own. NTA.", "NTA.

It's fair for you to prioritize your own family's needs and not take on the burden of supporting her.", "NTA, your mum just have to be an adult and support herself, this is what happens when you just expect everyone else to support you and then the plan doesn't quite work out.", "NTA at all.

Everyone states what they can realistically and are willing to do to help mom out. Make it clear that no one is going to be judged for what they are willing and able to do. Support doesnt have to mean an unlimited cash flow to mom. It could mean helping her connect with services for seniors and giving her advice about how to be an employee. What you have that is sorted, bring mom into the conversation. Tell her the following: this is what were willing to do. If this does not align with your vision of life, too bad. Were not going to give you the same lufe you had during your 40 year marriage. If you want to be taken care of like that, find a new husband.", "NTA choosing to be financially dependent on someone is such a dangerously optimistic move. \n\nNot up to you to pick up the slack for her. Most people don\u2019t want to work. Being able to find someone else to pay your bills is such a luxury. She\u2019s been privileged long enough.", "Wonderful story! Thank you for sharing!", "NTA, and mom needs to find a new sugar daddy or get used to a much lower standard of living.", "NTA.", "NTA It's not like you pressured her to never work, she needs to accept the consequences of her actions.", "YTA. This is your mom, but really this is your family. What are you thinking. Unless your mom was mean or abusive to you which you didn't mention in the prompt, her job when you were younger was raising you and your brothers. How can you think about just leaving your mom in the lurch. She's 67, what do you expect her to do now", "NTA  \nTell her that you also want to play her move of not working so you wont have any money to support her. She shouldnt be upset if she thinks not working and relying on others is ok.", "NTA.  Your mom is entitled.  Your mom birthed you, that was her decision.  Everything after that, raising you etc is mandatory.  It's part of having a child.  She provided for you.  You do not owe her anything.  She should have gotten a job a long time ago, but she was very happy doing nothing.  This situation is of her own doing.", "NTA\n\nI am in a situation similar to that with a family member who didn\u2019t have any retirement funds or get married or do anything and apparently I\u2019m supposed to swoop in and solve all her problems.\n\nNope. \n\nIt\u2019s terrible to watch people suffer, but ultimately we all lie in the beds we make for ourselves.", "NTA.... You can say no. She will probably look for a new relationship to throw herself into but this is what she chose.", "NTA. \n\nNo person should have kids so that someone is there to take care of them in the future. That\u2019s weird and disturbing. \n\nBut also\u2026you didn\u2019t ask to be born? She can\u2019t throw that in your face \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Actions have consequences. Given she married for 40 she would be entitled to alimony, spousal social security, part of his 401k or pension, and whatever marital assets.", "NT\n Tell her that you also want to play her move of not working so you wont have any money to support her.", " It's part of having a child. She provided for you. You do not owe her anything.", "I\u2019m pretty sure what they expected mom to do was plan adequately for retirement like an adult should.", "100% this!", "If you can't be there for your family who has done so much for you then that's shameful. Basically looking at the world through a transactional lens.\n\nParents are supposed to love and support their kids unconditionally even though kids well into adulthood make so many mistakes but it never goes the other way around"]}
