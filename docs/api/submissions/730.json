You\u2019re not wrong. And you\u2019re 15 so I\u2019m not going to judge you. \n\nBut you should leave this stuff up to the teacher and if it bothers you that much, speak to your counselor", "NTA for yelling", "NTA\n\nGod, I hate class clowns.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t mean to yell it out, and it\u2019s understandable to be upset when someone is being rude in front of you to someone in authority. \nI feel it is incredibly courageous of you to stand up for the teacher, however maybe speak with the teacher and school counselor about how to handle those situations differently next time.", "ESH. Yelling \"shut up\" is completely counterproductive and usually just makes people talk more and louder. You just added to the noise.", "ESH \nI get it, there\u2019s a lot of shitheads in Highschool and dealing with that in the morning time especially had to be irritating, but, if you lash out everytime you get irritated it\u2019ll only cause problems for u.

Plus we had shortened classes that that and I will take this into consideration", "Yeah, so... Hi, freshman science teacher here. There are not enough teachers at my school. I'm covering 2 teachers worth of classes. New teachers USUALLY have issues controlling classes. The sad thing is, with the way things are going, it's not just that affecting students like you who WANT to learn. It's also full class periods who are only doing Google Classroom stuff and don't have an actual teacher. Can you possibly get a schedule change? It isn't going to get better this year, I'm going to tell you that now. MAYBE if the new teacher gets a mentor and is guided through some really helpful disciplinary methods, when you get back from winter break it could be a start over point where things are better. But I'm telling you, either lower your expectations or get out because you are going to continue to be frustrated. I guess my next question is... can you just survive? Earbuds in, check out and get the work done. Or is this a class where you NEED the instruction?", "I am so sorry for you, keep strong.", "85 mins??! Holy shit? Alright yea I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to hold it in that long either but last thing u need is problems w ppl u gotta be in a room w for that long. J try and stick through it or if u can switch it out on ur schedule", "This is a mandatory class I must take I will see if I can get a schedule change just for home room since my rest of my classes are fine, my expectations are extremely low a day where it's not chaotic is a match made in heaven I do often keep my earbuds in during this class. I have also been surviving this for the 3 months we've been in school I can survive longer than  this honestly we don't have much school left we end in may that's 5 months I think I'll be fine.", "Yeah, I'm going to try that tomorrow, plus all of my classes are 80 minutes long just 85 for homeroom because we do homeroom shit then science", "Yeah, hang in there. I know the teacher appreciates you. But like I said, this is HER issue. Not yours. Don't make yourself look bad because she has no classroom management skills. That doesn't mean you should join the others, but you don't need to defend her or help her. You can always stay after class and apologize on behalf of the others if you feel like you need to tell her something. But I'd stay out of it. It takes 3 years for teachers to really get it. Best of luck."]}
