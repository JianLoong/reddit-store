First of all you are never a surrogate in a first ever pregnancy, usually - and that includes countries who are famous for their surrogacy-tourism - it has to be your third as a viable and healthy pregnancy and birth history can be suspected, if you gave birth to two healthy babies (preferable natural births btw.) and are more likely to give the baby up (as you form a very intimate and loving bond with the life you grow inside you). In most states in the US you also have to be married to be a surrogate, to prevent you from keeping the baby and suing the parents for child support or something like that. So my question is where and how would your wife and her friends would get this done as there are laws to protect both sides and they are usually all against your wifes circumstances.", "NTA if having kids together is important to you it makes sense you would want go pursue that first, there is a lot of complications that can occur in pregnancy and birth.

Also make sure that the surrogacy is done legally through a legitimate agency/doctors practice, and not some home turkey baster job. Also a contract needs to be sign and payment discussed. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to at the minimum have her health costs covered, loss of earnings pre birth and after. Also cost of therapy to deal with giving a baby she carried away. You and your fianc\u00e9 should not have to fund the surrogacy in any shape or form. If her friend can not afford to pay for these things then they can not afford to have a child, as these are basics they would have to pay if they were able to naturally conceive a child.
