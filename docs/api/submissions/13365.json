I bet the apology is a fake offering.", "NTA and a great big siblings. I don't understand parents that feel like you're 18 now, get out. And then to tell you to put her out too. Why your parents want her to suffer so much?", "NTA", "NTA.  You are an awesome sibling and I'm sure most of us agree that your parents suck.  And not in a good way.

Why did they kick her out and what is all this hate. NTA", "Sounds like they treated your sister like an unwanted puppy that you asked for and kicked her out as soon as she got to big.

You parents should be ashamed of themselves.", "God. You\u2019re a hero.\n\nMy parents, after a lifetime of telling me they were gonna \u201cfuck me over so bad, I didn\u2019t even know it yet,\u201d kicked me out in on my 18th birthday. I did really well in school and graduated early so they were able to kick me out and didn\u2019t have to worry that I would be making them look bad by my performance or appearance in school as I would now be homeless and I was always in honors and advanced courses. \n\nWhile I lived at home, when I was 16, my dad said he would kick me and my sister out if we didn\u2019t agree to sign to buy two identical $26,000 cars for our first cars- so he could tell everyone he bought them for us. However, he pulled some sort of crap where our names were only on the loans, and the cars were in his business name. He told us that was so we would save money on insurance, which we were each giving him $350 a month for, in addition to our $1300 a month rent which we worked three part time jobs to cover, while we were in school.\n\nWhen we were kicked out, my dad showed up and towed our cars away\u2014 they were his. We only owned the loans. We had nothing saved, and didn\u2019t even know what a credit card was. I ended up a heroin addict for ten years, and my twin sister is now in a wheelchair from her anorexia/bulimia/drinking. I have been sober for a decade. My sister will never have a normal life. But I often think of how things could have been if we had someone to encourage us, cause I think we had a lot of potential. \n\nI am so so so HAPPY your sister has you!!! You have no idea\u2026 you could never know\u2026 the life you have potentially saved her from. God love you.", "Definitely NTA!

You're taking care of your scapegoated sister. As the scapegoat you don't know how important that is.

Your parents didn't do you any favours with that bs excuse that they don't love her because she wasn't planned. Millions of unplanned pregnancies result in babies who are loved and cherished and cared for despite them not necessarily being deliberate additions to a family. They placed the \"blame\" for her existence on you then proceeded to treat her terribly, while telling you that they had her because YOU wanted it. Holy crap that is so abusive!! Definitely keep up that NC, you are 100% NTA", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s rare for the golden child to take up like that for the scapegoat. Good on you. You\u2019re a better person than your parents.", "What an awesome older sibling.  Definitely NTA but it makes me wonder why she was so disliked by your parents.  What she an affair baby and a constant reminder of the infidelity?

Thank God she has a loving brother. Now the parents who didn't want their daughter lost their son too. They reaped what they sowed.

Every child deserves to be loved.", "According to one of OP's responses, sister was an accident and the parents were going to abort but OP wanted a sibling so they kept her for that reason only.", "My oldest brother was the golden child but he's one of the most decent people I've ever met. My younger brother was also a golden child and he's a controlling, abusive asshole who thinks he's always right. Guess which one I still keep in contact with?", "I'd say it was probably the golden child vs scapegoat dynamic. I was the GC, my brother the SG, and he never really did anything to warrant the treatment he got. He was a bit more \"wild?\" I guess? But if she'd treated him right instead of hurting him, it'd probably have wound up way different to what it is now. Anyways, all that to say, there's not always a reason. Or at least, not always a reason someone reasonable would understand!", "Wow, just....wow. This is so awful. Your NTA, but your parents deserve every future lonely moment of sitting in an empty and dead silent house all by themselves.", "wtf???? I would never want any kind of contact with those people after that. Disgusting", "Don\u2019t EVER tell her this!!!!

Your sister is so lucky to have your love and support", "That\u2019s just so so awful. But good on you for taking care of your sister. I hope the good reward comes back to you one day.

She\u2019s likely an affair baby.", "I kinda want to jokingly say younger brother but we all know that's not true and it'd be your oldest brother", "We don\u2019t know from this post whether or not OP said anything to them when they all still lived together. It\u2019s also possible that OP only realized it was messed up after moving out and has tried to make amends to his sister since. \n\nAt the very least, OP stood up for her when it mattered, which is the most important bit.", "Myself and both my brothers were unplanned (my mom tried her damndest, but b/c information and access was hard to come by in the 70s--she made sure we had ALL the information, though.). The oldest siblings of both my parents were unplanned. I would speculate that a good half of my many first cousins were unplanned. On the other hand, the vast majority of my cousins' (Gen X  & older Millennials) kids were planned... what a difference access and information makes!\n\nBut, I've never felt unwanted or unloved, and I don't think anyone else in our family feels that way, either. \n\nI don't even mind the phrase accident... but it's all in the context, and that's easy to say when you grow up KNOWING you're loved and valued, and in a family culture where babies and children are valued and enjoyed.", "It's hard to realize some things aren't normal without some distance.", "The sister should be able to qualify for Medicaid if this is in the states. OP, take your sister to the nearest office & a rep should be able to help fill out the paperwork", "Yep. How much you want to bed she's an affair baby, and his parents have deflected all the blame on to her?", "Perhaps you can preface accident with 'happy'. \n\nBeing the family's 'happy accident' baby changes the tone completely.

My youngest was the best \u201csurprise\u201d ever and she describes herself as a unicorn - because that\u2019s how special she is. She keeps telling her older siblings they were PLANNED but she was a SURPRISE and surprises are fun. We love that she is leaning into it.", "Eh...I've always known that I was an accident, and my parents use that word. I also know that my conception really messed up their life plans and that they could have aborted but didn't for whatever reason. It's really never bothered me and because I knew that I was loved, it didn't matter if their reaction to a pregnancy test 33 years ago was \"Oh fuck.\" Most children are unplanned accidents because people continue to be terrible at using contraceptives effectively.", "I don't believe this, it doesn't make sense. There's something you're missing here, and I don't see why you didn't ask them point blank instead of the no contact, I would have asked the same question again and again if I were you.\n\nThere must be some deep issues with their parenting. \n\nBecause even if you were right about the unwanted child, they would have at least rationalized a logical reason in their head, not just \"we don't like her\", that doesn't exist in the real world.

Mine was able to help a lot and I\u2019m a pretty complex case. (Then again, I did prioritize mental/physical health support when choosing a school.) I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely worth a shot if it\u2019s free, but be ready to switch to an outside therapist if it\u2019s not enough.", "Yup. I had one session and they were like \"Nope! We can't help! We deal with studying stress, you have a lot of shit going on\".", "That was my first thought too tbh", "I think it depends on *when* you're told this too.
