Does it have some special meaning to her that makes her really want it in your wedding? Of course, it is your wedding, and you should have the songs you choose, but really, it\u2019s one song and she has done a huge amount of the work for you while going through some pretty serious stuff; in the greater scheme of things one song really is unimportant.

If it\u2019s a live musician at all, usually it will be a keyboardist/organist/guitarist and they know many more songs then you think.
