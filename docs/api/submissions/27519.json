We have avoided bars and don\u2019t go into liquor stores even for vapes. \n\nI am a cook learning to be a chef and decided to make a lemon shrimp risotto and cream of mushroom chicken the other night for supper. Anyone who has made risotto knows it contains white wine that gets added towards the beginning of the recipe and it reduces down and cooks out. I bought a can of white wine which was 8oz or about 2 glasses which she saw on the counter when I was getting everything prepped. I offered my M.I.L. some to which we declined however she doesn\u2019t eat anything \u201cfancy\u201d. We ate and everything was fine till the next day. She asked if I was drinking to which I said \u201cno, why? The wine can?\u201d To which she replied yes and had this look of catching me doing something I wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing. I explained it was for the risotto and it had cooked out and her argument was it doesn\u2019t cook out 100% and I was not to make anything that needed any kind of alcohol for the recipe. This makes cooking hard as a lot of recipes I want to try contain white wine.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want my husband to eat anything made with alcohol out of fear he MAY relapse. I work in a restaurant where every pasta dish uses white wine and the only thing my husband likes since salad and pizza aren\u2019t his preference from the menu. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole for this since it does cook out and any remaining alcohol is so minute he\u2019d get more alcohol from drinking an o\u2019doules.\n\nSo Reddit am I the asshole for making a dish with alcohol when my husband has been 9mths sober?\n\nEdit: after reading some of the comments I feel I should mention he doesn\u2019t care about the alcohol and knows what is in risotto. He no longer craves alcohol and doesn\u2019t have the urge to consume alcohol. He has had my risotto in the past as well.\n\nEdit 2: I reminded him of the recipe beforehand I didn\u2019t just say this is what we are having suck it up. Wine was never his preference he didn\u2019t like the taste of it and has always understood for a lot of cooks, restaurants,and chefs it\u2019s a staple for their recipes. He also understands that in order to further my career as a cook and someday chef I need to understand and learn to cook with alcohol.\n\nEdit 3: the wine can was in the trash empty and rinsed.", "created_utc": 1695527132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qnlfg/aita_for_making_risotto_when_my_husband_is_9mths/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
