So, AITA?\n\nMini update:\nWell I've gotten a bit of an explanation of what happened from my sister.  So apparently they didn't use the plastic sheets because the oldest boy slept in my bed.  He was so embarrassed and panicked that he just sort of... not told anyone and closed the door.  They then ended up not staying the whole weekend so he never got the chance to try to clean it up.  I'll chalk it up to early onset teenager brain, but my sister can't pay for a new mattress right now but swears to make it up to me. My nephew has also apologized.

Change the sheets not hard mom or sister could of done it", "I was talking about the mom. He said he left her a waterproof mattress pad yo use.", "I've never heard of such a thing. Is this new? Why wasn't I told?", "Yes. You need a gallon of Natures Miracle. It\u2019s a high concentrate enzymatic solution. The only thing that will work. Put over the stain soaking it and let it sit for 24 hours. Also add a few cups to wash with the bedding.", "it\u2019s common sense to change the sheets when someone does you a favor like this! if you can\u2019t do something that basic you shouldn\u2019t expect people to host you!", "A parent who doesn't notice that her kid wet the bed (unless the kid is half-grown) is a bad parent. She knew.", "She noticed and goves two fucks", "Just be aware, \"you can't be in the room with it\" means \"it can kill you.\"", "I only found out about them from my mental health NP. The building his office is in is old and has black mold problems. He did some research, bought one for his suite, and eventually the building manager bought a big industrial one to run at night when everyone leaves.", "This is frustrating to read, maybe find your spine in this and don't be a doormat anymore.", "Its probably soaked really deep into the mattress by now. And dried somewhat. Thats a replace situation. For sheets, yeah the pet cleaner is where its at for sure.", "I used Rocco and Roxie and angry orange.  I kills the smells of kids and pets.  I would spray the Rocco and Roxie on first, let it dry, then scrub with angry orange.  Good luck", "Highly recommend this as a quick solution until you get a new mattress", "With five young kids plus a baby she probably doesn't know if she's coming or going most of the time. Completely bonkers.", "Hmm not quite at the point where I wanna take those risks", "How does he get the diaper off? Does he not wear a sleep suit over the diaper?", "Duck tape that diaper in!", "I have saved mattresses from pee. Unfortunately, soaking in enzymatic cleaner means you are on the couch while you are addressing the issue because it can take days to dry.\n\nMy mattress cost more than my first car, using $10 in enzymatic cleaner seems a more sensible solution. Alternately, spending $100ish for a professional rug cleaner with the power wash accessories for mattresses and upholstery could probably do the job.", "He's learned how to remove his clothes and diaper. Spends a lot of time running around in his birthday suit. I'm guessing it's a phase", "According to my parents they could not get me to keep my clothes or diapers on after the age of one and a half.", "May not apply in your area but you can usually rent one (maybe not as good) for much less. If I was the sister and literally the ONLY condition for staying in my siblings house was \u2018don\u2019t get pee on my bed\u2019 I\u2019d have personally put down 3 plastic sheets and if somehow somebody still peed the bed I\u2019d have left all six of them with their daddy-waddy and used a rented carpet/upholstery cleaner to wash it sooooo meticulously until clean or until sib got back, whatever first!  Nta", "It might honestly be *why* the toddler is holding strong to the diaper removal habit. Some kids just prefer to be naked, or can't bear sitting in pee so will take diapers off as *soon* as it happens, before even an attentive parent would check on them. But some kids also get used to not being checked on.", "And your sister didn't think to put down a plastic/protective sheet?  That's frustrating.", "I think that it's about being noticed. He has found a way to get attention. And the bed wetting five year old is probably reacting to the baby and changes.", "Many young children can have small bladders (ages 5-10), some do not resolve into teens.", "NAH. OP, you sound like a reasonable fellow and a good brother. Your sister sounds just over-overwhelmed (an infant, a toddler, and 4 more kids, with a move pending and marriage problems, all crammed into a 2 BR apartment where both BRs are already occupied).\n\nIf you want to bar any future stay-overs, it would be understandable and not a AH move. But they're likely to be only in an emergency, which moves the needle on the AH meter.\n\nI think your sister needs to fix/clean/replace the mattress. If she can afford it, which seems unlikely since she's at your place instead of a hotel. And again, you seem like a good brother.\n\nSo I also think that for the rest of this vist (and in any similar future situation), you should protect yourself and your household by implementing any requested fix yourself instead of relying on your sister. Lock up what's not a toy, put the rubber pad on the bed, etc.\n\nYou do sound like an awfully good brother. \n\nAlso - to get strong smells out of laundry, wash with white vinegar and baking soda.", "Nta. I raised 6 kids and never would have let that happen. Your sister is lazy and selfish. Tell her she is not to relieve her stress by putting it on you.", "NTA. There is really no excuse for not cleaning up the mess. That was blatant and intentional disrespect.", "INFO: why aren't 3 of the 6 children with the husband? I understand the baby needs to stay with her, but after that I'd assign them to the other parent. (I'd  divvy them up with kids #6, #4, and #2 to her and #5, #3, and #1 to him.)", "Your sister needs to learn about birth control.", "Which country did all this happen in?", "\\*facepalm\\* NTA", "US", "I could see her being in denial about it if she's got a newborn, is moving, and has 5 other children. I would not blow up a relationship over this, but I would perhaps talk with your mother and set boundaries about her letting your sister stay the night if she doesn't have the bandwidth to not soak your bed in pee.\n\nI feel like I was extremely fried both postpartum and when moving with a toddler and 3 month old, and it's extremely possible she didn't register that your bed had no covering until it was too late, and now is avoiding your requests for compensation because it's yet another expense in a stressful time.\n\nIt doesn't make her actions right, but definitely take into account whether this is typical behavior for her or not when you decide how to proceed.", "It does not matter how overwhelmed your sister is. Before she left your place knowing she wouldn't be back, she should have checked EVERYTHING. Your update says it was her eldest, and the teen was embarrassed. That doesn't matter. Your sister failed to do an \"exit check\" of your apartment. Exit checks are normally just to make sure you haven't forgotten anything, especially with small kids who can wander off and move things around, but if your sister did her exit check properly and then your mother did her own \"post visitor inspection\" both women should have noticed the smell.", "My daughter used one to get the smell of cigarette smoke out of her very first car. It did a good job.", "Or, since it wasn\u2019t her home and she knew she could get away with being rude and disrespectful, she just didn\u2019t care."]}
