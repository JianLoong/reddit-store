Why on earth she would expect you to go help her move right after that is beyond me. She chose to work from home. She chose to have a pile of kids. Part of having kids is taking responsibility for what they do and at the very least trying to make it right if/when they damage something. The level of entitlement is pretty staggering here.

I wouldn't be feeling particularly generous either, and would definitely not be letting her or her fucking litter over any time soon. If grandma wants to see them she can go over to their place.\n\nIf money is tight, then you have *even more* of a responsibility to ensure your actions don't incur additional costs.
