We're pretty close and love each other to bits. She has two kids with a man who didn't want any. Both times she got pregnant he told her that if she didn't abort he would leave her. He has stepped up and has taken responsibilities though, but whenever things go south he accused her of making his life miserable and that he didn't want any of it. That's for background.\n\nI've been able to save some money and when I saw house's prices going down where they lived and a flat that had a very good price and was perfect for a family of four, I told her I would give her all my savings so adding her own savings she could have enough money to ask for a mortgage.\n\nI had just one condition. The house has to be in her name. I wanted to help provide stability to my niece and nephew so if they (my sister and bf) break up, there would be no doubts about the house ownership since she would be the one who would keep the kids. I have had very bad experiences with shared mortgage from friends and familiars with a lot of problems and hate in the process, so I didn't want any of it for my sister nor her kids. How I see things, everything's going to be for the kids at the end so we'll be providing for them.\n\nHere comes the tricky part. Even if the month mortgage is less than what they're paying for rent at the moment she won't be able to pay all of it (plus the shared costs of living and two kids) with her salary, so he would have to pay something to her for living there.\n\nHere is when things went very wrong.\nHe said if he had to pay for part of the house he had to get part of the house and what we were asking from him was unfair and I was being an as***le because it meant I didn't trust their relationship.\nI said he was ok to pay a total stranger for the rent but not her girlfriend and that it wasn't me the one who have to have faith in them but themselves. If he really thought they were good together, he shouldn't be worried about having a house because he would be living with his family (and saving money for himself).\nMy sister is kinda sad  because they are now fighting and some of her friends agree with her bf's opinion.\n\nI feel like an a***ole for putting her in this predicament even if my intentions were good.\n\nI'm not rich, I have a family too with two small kids, so those savings were very important to me too.\n\nI think I'm the AH for stepping in on how they do things, but not for my request.

But WHY on earth are you just giving away all of your life\u2019s savings? Get your own place and have the kids over often. You don\u2019t get to control their relationship, with money or not.", "Nah. He would have to pay rent in a rented home and wouldn't get to keep that house either. Could you not get the mortgage in your name and rent the house to her? That way he gets jack.", "NTA,  You have a very good heart.  The only thing I could suggest is any way you could also be on the mortgage paperwork so your sister could not borrow against the mortgage and let this man get his hands on the money?", "NTA It isn't wise to get her any house she can't afford on her own very comfortably. If she had to rely on others to cover mortgage it isn't going to work. \n\nFocus on buying a house for yourself, one that has extra room and you can perhaps offer your sister and kids a place to stay if shit hits the fan", "You're absolutely NTA. \n\nThis is a man who threatened to leave your sister twice in order to get her to go through an abortion. The only reason he's throwing a tantrum because he's terrified by the idea that he'll ultimately need your sister more than she'll need him. There are kids involved too, and no good uncle would even consider putting the house under the name of a mentally abusive father. You're a caring brother, and I think you're doing what's absolutely necessary.", "You could if possible just buy the house and rent it to her/them, with a view to hand it over in the far future.\n\nThat comes with its own technicalities and problems but at least the property will be in safe hands and your sister in a potentially secure home.\n\nNTA, you are right to want to ensure security for your sister and her kids.", "I don't think you're an AH for the offer or condition. But you have definitely created an issue for your sister. This is always a huge debate topic when it comes up in the sub (at least, it's always a debate when the woman has money for a house deposit, not so much the other way around). I suspect that they will not be able to come to a deal that works for you, so you will not end up giving her your savings, and then all she will have gained from the offer is a massive fight with her partner. So it really sucks for her!", "NAH But you can't fix this. It's too delicate to work how you hope it would. Go cheaper, something you and she can afford. If he's paying the mortgage, obviously he is going to want some equity. That's just normal.\n\nIf we were talking about his history, maybe N T A. But this is a finance question, and on the finance front he's 100% reasonable.", "NTA. It's your money and well done for trying to keep your sister's and nephews' assets safe. The ball is in your sister's court now.", "YTA You want to do a good thing, but apparently he is the one to contribute the most at the house expenses, so that would a lot unfair to pay for a house that wouldn't be his. The mortgage is going to be paid by both so the house has to be in both of their name.\n\nThe guy doesn't seem a good person but also your sister is not, considering that she knew that he doesn't want children, and she made him a father anyway. Your niece and nephew would have more stability with a father that wanted them, I understand that you want to help your sister but make her and her boyfriend life harder is not the way to do it", "INFO: \n\nWhy are you willing to spend your life savings to help your sister buy a house, when you have a family of your own to look after, and as you said, you aren't rich? \n\nYou need to look after your own kids first, instead of whatever you're doing with your sister's love life. Yes her partner does sound like a massive AH. But you throwing thousands of dollars in the mix isn't helping the situation. She is grown. And it sounds like she isn't going to leave him any time soon. You need to focus on your own family unit.", "NTA if he leaves her she maybe could afford it with child support he'd have to pay. It's your money you have every right to put stipulations on any loan, you're not a bank that's subject to fair lending laws.", "YTA. The guy sounds terrible and you might be entirely right, but according to your post you've offered this. Now, if you could buy your sister a house outright, sure. Still kind of tricky, but it'd be your money.\n\nBut a mortgage is going to be part of their spending. If your sister is paying into it, it'll impact both their finances. From his perspective he's basically getting cut out.\n\nThere's no good way to fix this either. You can't be blamed for not wanting to put money into a relationship you don't really believe in, so you'd have to withdraw the offer.", "I'm not going to vote because it's a bit ambiguous, you may have overstepped a bit and caused trouble.\n\nRegardless, do not throw your life savings at this house which he will take half of when they break up. (If they're not married and you're in a country where he wouldn't be able to get anything, ignore this) \n\nThe house shouldn't even be in her name, it should be in yours. They get to live there and you can charge them less for rent than market price. You can even have it go to their kids when you/your sister die.

But you are talking about giving away your life savings when you have kids yourself. You can\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep your sister warm. Her life is in her hands\u2026maybe she should have left him after his first several ultimatums before getting pregnant a second time and making everything worse. It seems like you are trying to get her to leave him by giving her this offer knowing the bf would be upset and refuse it. I fear you are going to relent and give her your savings anyway with his name on the deed. Just withdraw the offer and take care of your own children.", "INFO: did they ask for money or help with improving current living situation or did you just decide to do this because you saw the market changes?", "Then co own with your sister in relation to money invested in %  and he lives in your part and owes you rent\nNTA", "This is a horrible idea & messy financial decision. You should buy the house & title it in your name. Charge them rent to cover your insurance, mortgage, and property taxes. (Which would be a lot less than the current rent) Write up a will to leave the home to your sister & children. You are getting overly involved otherwise. YWBTA to try to control their living situation.", "YTA. If he's paying for the house, he obviously should own it, and I think it would be really weird to pay a boyfriend or girlfriend for the privilege of living with them. People in serious relationships tend to share things, that's part of the whole point. You may not like the relationship that they're in, but they're in it.\n\nIt mostly sounds like you're trying to pay your sister to make different relationship choices. Maybe the guys a dick, but to be honest I would be pretty angry if someone I was in a relationship with got pregnant when I don't want kids - although since there's two it looks like he wasn't exactly being cautious so it is his fault too. But yeah, gifts with conditions like that are not something a lot of people would accept, no matter how generous. It feels more like trying to control something, and he would be stuck in a bad living situation. They're his kids too, even if he resents them.\n\nGiving your life savings in this situation is also a bit out there, but that's your choice. But using your money to engineer a situation where your sister's boyfriend is also her tenant is not appropriate.", "YTA. Just imagine the roles were reversed, the guy asking your sister to pay for his mortgage with her not getting a piece of the cake. He could walk away any time, and your sister would be left with nothing. After years, possibly decades of contributing. You'd be outraged and rightly so.", "ESH \n\nI think if you want to give money away it is OK for it to be conditional. However, it is near impossible to legally uphold the condition because if the house is under her sole ownership she would be legally allowed to transfer it to her bf at any time.\n\nFurthermore, is your sister a golddigger because it seems shes not able to pay the mortgage even if its cheaper than her current rent. So how much does she contribute to her household finances currently? Her kids are no excuse because she knows very well that her bf did not want them yet she chose to bring them into the world. Are they being provided for adequately? \n\nI can understand his position because it definitely feels like betrayal that he has to pay for the house but not have some ownership of it, all the while he has probably been paying the large part of the household expenses. Of course, at the end of the day the money is not going to him but to your sister so he has no say in how this money is spent. However, once the money reaches your sister, he would not be wrong to feel aggrieved if she doesnt share it with him. \n\nI think putting her in this predicament is not nice of her. However, there seems to be numerous underlying issues regarding their relationship that would be good to flesh out before it rots even further. Having said that, you guys are already nearly 40 so Im honestly not so sure if there really is ever going to be a solution.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
