Maybe the guys a dick, but to be honest I would be pretty angry if someone I was in a relationship with got pregnant when I don't want kids - although since there's two it looks like he wasn't exactly being cautious so it is his fault too. But yeah, gifts with conditions like that are not something a lot of people would accept, no matter how generous. It feels more like trying to control something, and he would be stuck in a bad living situation.

However, it is near impossible to legally uphold the condition because if the house is under her sole ownership she would be legally allowed to transfer it to her bf at any time.\n\nFurthermore, is your sister a golddigger because it seems shes not able to pay the mortgage even if its cheaper than her current rent. So how much does she contribute to her household finances currently? Her kids are no excuse because she knows very well that her bf did not want them yet she chose to bring them into the world. Are they being provided for adequately? \n\nI can understand his position because it definitely feels like betrayal that he has to pay for the house but not have some ownership of it, all the while he has probably been paying the large part of the household expenses. Of course, at the end of the day the money is not going to him but to your sister so he has no say in how this money is spent. However, once the money reaches your sister, he would not be wrong to feel aggrieved if she doesnt share it with him. \n\nI think putting her in this predicament is not nice of her.

However you are just helping provide for part of a down payment so if he pays half the mortgage for the 30 years he will be paying hundreds of thousands of dollars and have no equity in the house. He might be a terrible person or whatever but you are basically expecting him to subsidize a house for your sister that she can\u2019t afford alone which creates an unfair power balance since she can kick him out anytime and leave him with nothing", "YTA mind your own business and keep that money for your own family's future. Let your sister be a grownup.", "NTA but it's generally a bad idea to get involved with financial situations of friends or family. Just make sure your own house is big enough to accomodate your sister, niece and nephew if things would ever go sideways in her relationship.", "NTA, but you should get some legal advice before you do this. And you may want to think about putting yourself on the deed along with your sister.  And then perhaps a formal agreement between you and sister that you get your money back first if the flat is sold. Either way, speak with a lawyer who handles real estate matters wherever you are. You need to protect your investment.", "NTA", "NTA, but at the same time the boyfriend is correct. If he's expected to put money into it, he should expect to get equity. The down payment is just a percentage of the equity, not all of it.  \n\nThere are tax implications for your sister collecting money over a certain amount from him in this manner. Essentially, she'd be charging him rent and that is income. Either that, or a gift. Both are reportable (again, over a certain amount). Same with your money, for that matter. \n\nAlso, you can't just charge whatever you want for \"rent.\" if you rent to someone related to you like this, you have to charge a certain percentage of the market rate or else the difference is considered a (potentially) reportable gift from you. It's just way too messy. \nYou should either pay the extra part of the mortgage that your sister can't afford, or find a place where she can afford it all.\n\nYou're very generous, and you are absolutely right to want to keep the boyfriend's name off of it.", "NTA\n\nBut giving away all your savings seems like a bad idea \n\nIf you are hell bent on buying a place for them- buy the home in YOUR NAME and rent it to them.", "LENDING someone money for a down payment is mortgage fraud. You can give her money, but you will generally have to sign a document saying the money is a gift and you dont expect repayment.\n\nDont hand over the money unless you are willing and able to give it as a gift. Don\u2019t co-sign unless you are willing and able to make all the mortgage payments yourself. \n\nBuying the house yourself and renting it to her is probably a better option, if you can afford it.", "NTA", "It's going to be my policy from now on. I don't usually mess with other business, somehow her being my sister made me feel with the authority but I was totally wrong.", "Yes yes... Really bad idea, I can see it now. I should learn from this", "Not only that, but once it's in her name, you have no power over what she does with it anyway. Could she in theory, put husband on at a later date, or make him the sole beneficiary in her will?", "Your good position with good pay could be eliminated at any moment though. Layoffs happen. Medical emergencies happen. I understand your love for and desire to help your sister, but you have to put your family first. Hopefully you\u2019re able to find another way to offer her help and support. You sound like a really good brother.", "Best wishes to you.", "What if you bought it and rented it to her so you know he at least can\u2019t evict her? There would still be the question of what would happen if he doesn\u2019t pay rent, whether you own it or her", "Maybe it could be jointly owned, you and your sister. And someone should explain to the boyfriend how rent works.", "NTA- but buy the house yourself and let them rent from you.", "NTA Please keep your finances separate from family. Buy a house in your own name and rent it out.", "NTA. I dont know where you live but in many countries if they are married or common-law any property either of them purchases  during the marriage is considered shared property. Unless your name is on the mortgage, you have no control over this. If you don\u2019t want him to have a stake I this, I would encourage you to speak to a lawyer. Seems like you\u2019re making a ton of assumptions", "Buy a house for yourself and if you ever have enough for another down payment, buy another place and rent it to them until he\u2019s gone.  Then, sell it to her if she can afford it.", "NTA but why tf are you doing this? She's an adult who can figure it out", "NTA.  You wanted to help your sister and her children, but the deal cannot go ahead in the circumstances.  Take the offer off the table.  If they want to own a property then they will have work it out themselves.  Your sister is the one who chooses to stay with this man, so she bares some of the responsibility of her predicament.  I know you love her, but you can help her in other ways.  You should not move forward with this idea, because she will need money from him to help pay, and if he leaves her she might lose her home or you will have to help her to pay her mortgage on top of your own.  It\u2019s too messy and problematic, and could potentially leave her in worse circumstances if she ends up with legal fees.  Do something else for her kids like a college fund and driving lessons when they get older.  You\u2019re a great uncle.  NTA", "NTA, except that you're being too generous. If you want to lend her money, write up a mortgage agreement of some kind so that if she doesn't pay you back, you can take her to court.", "I completely understand your concern. He does not sound at all committed to your sister or his children. One foot is halfway out the door all the time, the way you explain it. Of course, that could just be your take on it and not his.\n\nMy husband and I bought a house when he was not working, so he couldn't contribute to the mortgage payments. He had savings that contributed to the down payment, but the home was in my name only because the mortgage company would not take on an unemployed person as a debtor. When he got a job, he started paying. It was never an issue who's name the house was in. When we sold it and bought another we shared in the assets. Your sister's partner's attitude toward the house being in her name is what raises my eyebrows. If he truly intends to be a long-term partner, what difference does it make whose name is on the deed?", "She needs to dump that walking extra large red flag. \n\nNTA", "The smart thing would have been to buy the house in their name and rent it out to them if he wanted to help his sister. Even if she had agreed there was nothing stopping sister from adding her husband to the title of the home later. But beyond that giving her his entire savings when he admits he has his own kids to look after seems incredibly insane.", "Did you discuss this with your wife before telling your sister?", "Wait. You have a wife?  So you\u2019re going to blow up your own personal finances to buy a house for your sister that she can\u2019t afford, greatly impacting your own wife\u2019s financial stability?\n\nAlso, depending on the state, the title of the house may not matter that much in a divorce. So you may not be accomplishing anything. \n\nFinally your sister is really shitty for marrying a guy who didn\u2019t want kids and baby trapping him twice over. She deserves the broken marriage. \n\nYTA.", "Yes and their partner (unless they are a single parent) most likely wouldn\u2019t be thrilled about giving that money away especially if they saved together", "Yes, of course. Even if these are my savings I still think of them like for the family.", "Ah I still kind of feel weird that you would give away money that you don\u2019t really have for your sisters family when you need it, too.", "Well, I do have that money and I don't need it right now. I can't talk for the future though... And there lays the problem. I haven't taken on consideration a lot of things it seems"]}
