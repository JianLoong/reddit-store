Nevertheless, eventually the situation changed drastically, and my father became very wealthy while my aunt struggled financially. With that in mind, my sister shows up to my house one day and says she\u2019s moving in (she is 20 at this point). My parents gladly accept this and I was complacent. Eventually however, I started to see the real reason she was there. She clearly was struggling financially, and my aunt could no longer support her financial habits (my sister had just come from a cruise to Portugal). After she started living with us, she started to just use my parents for their money. From a new car to a new apartment to so much more. They were just happy to have her back and it wasn\u2019t my money, so I said nothing.\n\nThen, she slowly started edging me out of the family and since I was in college on the west-coast I couldn\u2019t really stop it.

She divorced him because she found him too controlling (he was just an adult trying to save money for the future, she wanted to go to Milan for a girls trip). The new guy she is married to is an abusive ass, but that's a story for another time.", "My parents try to see the best in people and always give people another chance. They are good people, who worked hard to make it in this country despite the many challenges they faced. Their only sin is that they trusted people they thought cared for them.", "I have lots of family and friends who see the best in people - but they also know how to set and enforce boundaries. By not enforcing boundaries on your sister your parents ensured that she never had to face the consequences of her own actions and learn important lessons that would have taught her to modify her behavior.\n\nGiving someone everything they ask for isn't helping, it's creating a crutch so that person doesn't have to grow and mature. I'm not saying that your parents don't have good hearts, but just that the road to hell is often paved with good intentions.  \n\n\nYou helped your sister, but have now cut her off when she made it clear that she doesn't want to work or reign in her spending. You are choosing to not enable her - that's good. It doesn't necessarily feel nice, but you're helping her in the long run.", "A few things, they possibly might be enablers, but they weren't there for a majority of her childhood. She grew up with my aunt, who had an abusive husband. He wasn't abusive at the time of the adoption, but became abusive when she my sister a teenager (specifically after he lost his job which led to alcoholism and etc).\n\nIn a way I understand why my parents acted the way they did. They feel directly responsible for what she became, something they could not have predicted, nor could they prevent it (they tried and even took my uncle to court, my aunt changed her mind at the end and dropped the case). A lot of guilt drove their decisions surrounding my sister.\n\nTo be fair to my aunt, she did what she did out of fear that my sister would have to grow up without a father. Though she did end up divorcing him, that caused a whole host of other financial troubles, which is a part of why she became no longer able to support my sister's lifestyle choices. My uncle he ran away to British Columbia and took her family jewelry. It was the only wealth she had left that wasn't taken or spent by him.\n\nI specifically also feel an odd sort of guilt. If not for her circumstance then that of what may become of her own son.\n\nI feel as though, if she doesn't get her act together he will become just like she became.", "NTA. You did more than enough to help your sister. She now has to step up, and help herself. You are supporting your own family, and your parents too.", "NTA  \nShe has a husband, it is his families turn. Your moms feelings of guilt is not something you should be financing for eternity.", "NTA she need to live her own life. She\u2019s an adult.", "nta and neither are y our parents.   if they are so bad off they can go to welfare or social services depending where they are.", "NTA, she is just a selfish leech don't enable her, also that's tough on your parents cause I'm sure she is guilt shaming them, have a serious talk with your parents and explain you can't support her and she needs to grow the F up, she has a husband too and there is a marvelous thing called working which will help her get money.", "NTA. At some point she has to accountable for her own life. You\u2019ve tried to help her and she did not follow through.

Either way, she is not your financial responsibility.", "NTA- It's actually your aunt who has a case to answer, not your parents. By 20 the personality was set in. At this point giving her money isn't supporting her, it's allowing her to continue an unsustainable lifestyle. It seems like she's not going to support herself unless she has no other option.", "NTA.\n\nIt kinda sounds like your sister's excessive spending have may at least in part contributed to your aunt's financial ruin and later your parents'. High time she grew up.", "You need to talk to your parents and explain how things are, how they were abused, how you refuse to be abused as well, to them. I think they are guillible as f and that needs to stop.\n\nNta", "NTA. Your sister will never stop asking for money as long as you are giving it to her. She needs to be financially cut off. It\u2019s time to sink or swim and she needs to live with the consequences of her actions.

You have done more than enough.\n\nI'd like to respectfully challenge your view of your parents. I don't doubt they're good people and see the best in others. But they are wilfully blinding themselves to their oldest child's faults by allowing guilt to cloud their judgement. It must have been an extremely difficult choice to give up their baby, but they did it with her best interests at heart. They didn't leave her at an orphanage, but with a financially stable relative who loved her as her own.\n\nPerhaps you could ask them to consider the pattern your sister is perpetuating. Your aunt was quite wealthy - after supporting your sister's unhealthy spending habits she's destitute. Your parents get rich and take her in - after supporting your sister's unhealthy spending habits they now rely on you for most of their basic needs. She sucks people dry and then tosses them aside, and you (rightly) refuse to be next. This is NOT their fault. I hope they can let go of this unproductive guilt, and you are able to ask them to please stop pressing you about this.", "NTA. You said they were wealthy and now they're not. Sounds like she blew through a lot of their money. Just because they refuse to stand up to her that doesn't mean you have to do the same. She'll continue to use you as an ATM for years if you let her.", "NTA. I've been in a similar situation (not family history, just supporting siblings ) and once you start they never let you stop. \n\nIt's good to help family when the really need it. 3 months of rent and job leads was a lot and she should of been good after that.", "NTA. As your parents learned from bailing your sister out, money doesn't grow on trees. She has to fail to learn to get her act together. This is something that's never going to fix and will always be your issue of you taking it on. \n\nDon't enable the bad behavior. This isn't your fight. Help your parents but not your sister. She's going to have to learn to get a job and pay her rent first. \n\nI get this was your parents second chance but they even have to understand that she's at an age where responsibility should've kicked in already and she's not changing and everyone has done enough for her and it's time to let her fly.", "I would also vote n.t.a op if would not happen to know similar story from my Indian colleague. In her case, her parents dropped her on distant relatives in favour of her younger brother. She told me, how common it is to get rid of girls in India. That only boy will bring money to family and how boys are expected to support old parents (what you actually prove in your story). She never had a chance to reconcile with her parents and was never recognised by her brother. So the tone of your story, when you keep calling parents only your parents, your hatred towards your sister\u2026.  YTA", "NTA You didn't give her to your aunt. You don't owe her restitution for anything.", "Again, whole story told by OP just does not add up, that\u2019s the problem. Super wealthy parents who suddenly can not afford their own bills while living in India? What is sister background, did she get same education as OP? Why her husband is asking OP for money too? Both of them (sister and husband) should be well into their 30-s. Parents bought the flat and the car to sister and paid all her debts, but she is broke? So I truly call bullshit on this story:)", "NTA, time for her to grow up and stand on her own two feet.", "NTA\n\nYour sister has been coddled her whole life. So has mine. \n\nYour sister is two things.\n\nOne, a manipulator. She's purposefully chosen to do incomprehensibly vile behavior. \n\nTwo, your sister is immature. She grew up that way, recognized some of it, and did what she could to keep the gravy train running. She grew comfortable in her dysfunction. Her dysfunction is never having to take responsibility for herself.\n\nThe constant monetary support kept your sister from gaining emotional, physical, and social clarity. She had no reason to do so. Only change will allow that.\n\nLet your sister fail. Failing will force her into reality for, possibly, the first time in her life.", "Big sis. She was adopted by the aunt seven years before OP was born. She moved back in with OP\u2019s parents when she was 20 and OP was presumably 13 or younger. But otherwise yes.", "Do the sons have a say in it? Did OP?", "But yall have one of the most beautiful cultures, family drama not withstanding. \nNta either way", "You did the right thing kicking her out. She is a blood sucking leech and will suck you dry. Your own family comes first. You can\u2019t financially support 3 families with your salary, your BIL needs to man up and provide for your sister. Does BIL have a job? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your sister is the reason her husband doesn\u2019t have any money left for rent. If they really can\u2019t afford paying rent they should move in with her in-laws. If you allow her inside your home, she will NEVER leave. She will even get pregnant on purpose so you can\u2019t evict her. She probably only reaches out to you when she needs something, right?\n\nYou need to cut off all contact with her and if she continues harrassing you for money you have to disown her. She\u2019s a user and couldn\u2019t care less about you and your family.", "Is there even a hint of understanding in his story? Only being hostile and nasty towards his sister. This just tells me he does not tell us whole story.", "Lack of empathy doesn't oblige you to give someone free room and board to make up for it. OP is not the one who sent his sister away. He wasn't even born then!", "NTA.  Your sister doesn't give a damn about anyone or what they feel or want.  She just wants someone to give her money that she doesn't deserve.   It's time for her to grow up and make it on her own.", "NTA", "NTA.  Sounds like OP's sister just wants to take advantage - as she probably feels entitled since she was given up for adoption.\n\nOP made the right choice here.  She helped a bit in the beginning but isn't letting herself be turned into an ATM.", "Your parents are not showing kindness. They are enabling her out of guilt.", "NTA.\n\nShe is a parasite and will not stop until she had seen enough consequences. But for that, it is needed that she don\u2019t get any help.", "Wow, she grew up poor, but ended up becoming entitled and you grew up wealthy and have empathy. Plot twist! NTA.", "she ruined financially your aunt, your parents, her first husband, and now you are next in the list.  she would not stop until you are ruined too, and the \"angels\" surely will help her to push you until you cave out.  NTA", "This. OP, I would tell your sister to never show up at your door again. Make it clear to her that you will never give her a penny. You already bailed her out, and you're done. If she shows up at your door, don't answer. If she asks you for money, literally don't give her a penny. She'll just keep coming back because, apparently, she and her partner don't want to work. They just want to be bailed out."]}
