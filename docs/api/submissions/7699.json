My aunt couldn\u2019t have kids so my aunt adopted my sister from my parents when she was born. This is a decision that has always been tough on my mom, but, at the time (seven years before I was born), my father\u2019s business went bankrupt (long story) and they thought this was the best decision. Nevertheless, eventually the situation changed drastically, and my father became very wealthy while my aunt struggled financially. With that in mind, my sister shows up to my house one day and says she\u2019s moving in (she is 20 at this point). My parents gladly accept this and I was complacent. Eventually however, I started to see the real reason she was there. She clearly was struggling financially, and my aunt could no longer support her financial habits (my sister had just come from a cruise to Portugal). After she started living with us, she started to just use my parents for their money. From a new car to a new apartment to so much more. They were just happy to have her back and it wasn\u2019t my money, so I said nothing.\n\nThen, she slowly started edging me out of the family and since I was in college on the west-coast I couldn\u2019t really stop it. My parents are still amazing people, and they still cared for me but I could tell she wanted me gone and she went to great lengths to try and make that happen (she failed, because my parents are amazing).\n\nEventually, I grew up, I became a physician and started my own family, so I moved on. My parents retired and moved back to India to live out their life among our family. Unable to use them for their house and money, she shows up to my house with her husband and her bags, asking to move in.\n\nShe cried to me about how she lost her job, couldn\u2019t afford her rent and that she had so much debt (she didn\u2019t, my father had quite literally paid it all off). She eventually calls my parents, and they try to convince me to let her stay. I say no, and my mother starts pleading to treat her kindly as her brother. She says how it\u2019s not her fault, and being the angel my mother is, she continued to blame herself for having given my sister away, which she believed led to what she became.\n\nI caved and eventually gave her some money to rent for a few months until she found a job. I even called a few friends to get her some interviews (which she never went to). Three months passed and needing more rent she showed up to my house again and having had enough I say no. I kicked her out of my house and my parents have been pleading for me to help my sister ever since. (Just for some extra information, my parents are no longer in the position to financially support themselves, and I, happily, provide them with some money to pay their monthly bills and their house. It is the least I could do).\n\n\\*Also please do not disrespect my parents.

They are good people, who worked hard to make it in this country despite the many challenges they faced. Their only sin is that they trusted people they thought cared for them.", "I have lots of family and friends who see the best in people - but they also know how to set and enforce boundaries. By not enforcing boundaries on your sister your parents ensured that she never had to face the consequences of her own actions and learn important lessons that would have taught her to modify her behavior.\n\nGiving someone everything they ask for isn't helping, it's creating a crutch so that person doesn't have to grow and mature. I'm not saying that your parents don't have good hearts, but just that the road to hell is often paved with good intentions.  \n\n\nYou helped your sister, but have now cut her off when she made it clear that she doesn't want to work or reign in her spending.

She grew up with my aunt, who had an abusive husband. He wasn't abusive at the time of the adoption, but became abusive when she my sister a teenager (specifically after he lost his job which led to alcoholism and etc).\n\nIn a way I understand why my parents acted the way they did. They feel directly responsible for what she became, something they could not have predicted, nor could they prevent it (they tried and even took my uncle to court, my aunt changed her mind at the end and dropped the case). A lot of guilt drove their decisions surrounding my sister.\n\nTo be fair to my aunt, she did what she did out of fear that my sister would have to grow up without a father. Though she did end up divorcing him, that caused a whole host of other financial troubles, which is a part of why she became no longer able to support my sister's lifestyle choices. My uncle he ran away to British Columbia and took her family jewelry. It was the only wealth she had left that wasn't taken or spent by him.\n\nI specifically also feel an odd sort of guilt. If not for her circumstance then that of what may become of her own son.\n\nI feel as though, if she doesn't get her act together he will become just like she became.", "NTA.
