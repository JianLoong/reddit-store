Six hours of waiting is nothing.\n\nI think your brother will probably make Tina return the figures anyway, but the important thing is the reason behind why she should return the figures that she needs to learn.

You were right to let him make the decision. If Wendy can\u2019t wait 6 hours, tough luck, maybe she can take money out of Bill\u2019s allowance to pay her stepson.\n\nPersonally I think Tina should return the figures and be taught compassion, but I will never say she\u2019s wrong. Bill needs to be made responsible for his decisions. He wagers something means he\u2019s claiming ownership of it. If these things weren\u2019t his to give, that\u2019s something he has to work with the owners, his brother.

You bet on a bet, and if you lose you lose the bet.\n\nTina and Bill went into the game knowing winner takes all, and Tina won, so Bill needs to take responsibility.\n\nThat responsibility can come in the form of having his allowance reduced or doing chores to earn money to pay back his brother.\n\nHowever, I think Tina should return the figures. She needs to be taught that she\u2019s too young for gambling and that she doesn\u2019t have legal rights over the figures. This is something her father needs to teach her or if he allows you to you can. It\u2019s important that she learns that she is not wrong for thinking she is entitled to the winning, but that situations can sometimes get complicated and so she should stay away from gambling until she is older and wiser.\n\nI think Wendy is A H for trying to make Bill get out of the mess without consequences for his part.", "Honestly, the fact that she swindled her cousin into putting up permanent ownership of items in return for a shot at temporary use of her stuff is enough to be worrying by itself. Such an inclination towards being a rip off artist should, in my opinion, be nipped in the bud hard. The fact that this also involved talking him into putting up goods for the bet that they both knew didn't belong to Bill makes it way worse, though. Since unless I am greatly misreading the story it seems like her niece knew that Bill was just watching the toys for someone else and they didn't actually belong to him.", "She is the adult in charge. She absolutely does have the right to take the belongings away. She also needs to exercise common sense.", "I really don't see how you can come to the conclusion that Tina is in no way responsible for it when she is literally the one who demanded he use the toys as the wager while knowing Bill was just watching them for someone else.", "Have you ever been asked to take 24/7 custody of a child for an entire month? Because its a bit of a different fish then watching the kid for a few hours while her parents go out on a dinner date or something like that. The caretaker is indeed expected to make certain kinds of choices about the kid instead of calling their parents every time a choice more meaningful then what to make them for lunch comes into play. It kind of defeats the point of a long term caretaker to be on the phone every 5 minutes micromanaging what they do because you didn't give them any sort of flexibility to make calls on your behalf.", "How is it in any way his brother's call over whether his daughter has to return something she stole? The decision is on whether the person who was robbed wants to let it go and just let Tina keep the stuff ***and they don't.***  Her daddy has no ability to swoop in and say she owns her stolen property so his input is irrelevant. You don't own stolen property just because you bought it in good faith from someone thinking they had legal ownership when in fact they didn't. And if I am reading the story right Tina was well aware that Bill was just watching those toys as opposed to being their owner and can't even claim the 'why should I be punished for dealing in good faith by having to relinquish them, screw the loser who got robbed not my problem' argument.", "Lots of problems here for sure. Primary of which being an absent adult responsible for a pre-teen that\u2019s showing some concerning sociopathic behaviors.", "This is definitely a valid concern, but it's a bit different.\n\n* Returning the property Bill stole from his brother was obviously what needed to be done, and any responsible adult should be expected to do their part to resolve the situation.\n* Unless they have an explicit agreement about discipline, talking to Tina about her poor behavior and setting consequences for it is properly the role of her father, not her aunt who is temporarily looking after her.", "I didn't say anything about a conclusion on Tina being responsible or not, although I'd be unlikely to call a 9 yo an AH\n\nOP didn't say that Tina knew at the time that they were Bill's brothers, not Bill's toys. \n\nI believe Tina's dad should tell her she has no business gambling and make her return the toys immediately, but that doesn't mean that Wendy wasn't 100% wrong making demands on OP who was babysitting.", "You're NOT reading the story right. \n\nWe know the toys didn't belong to Bill because the OP told us.

Even if she wasn't a witness to this it seems exceedingly unlikely that Bill wouldn't give the same response most people would and say 'but those don't even belong to me' as his first reply to her asking him to wager the toys. Its not 100% impossible she didn't know it, but as described it seems way more likely then not that she was aware that he was watching them for someone else. And if not she certainly does now and her response was 'screw that loser who got robbed, they belong to me now'. There is no scenario in which she isn't a greedy brat happy to receive stolen goods.

See how it doesn't say that Tina knew that ?", "Read my post again, it doesn't matter. You are quibbling over whether she knew she was a thief when she made the bet or knows she is a thief now that she has been told they weren't Bill's toys but insists ownership has transferred to her anyway. Anyone who insists they own something they know was given to them by someone who wasn't the real owner and won't give it back to the real owner is a thief.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd don't try to tell me she is too young to understand this, either. A 9 year old is old enough to understand ownership and knows that you can't get something that belongs to person A by requesting person B give it to you. 9 year olds don't go up to random people and ask them to give them random things, they know to ask the person it belongs to.", "If it doesn\u2019t matter, why do you keep bringing it up ?  \n\n\nTina\u2019s father will manage the situation in a few hours when he is done with work.", "Because the lump of gristle I call a brain didn't spark enough neurons at once to realize it was a quibble detail until after I already brought it up and someone responded.", "YTA Those figurines were not Bill's to gamble.

The figures weren't Bill's to bet and I don't see how Tina has any right to keep them. Maybe Tina didn't know that at the time, but she knows now. Refusing to return what she now knows is stolen property is very concerning. I wonder how OP would feel if Tina took something of hers and gambled it away. Would she say whoever Tina lost it to had earned it?", "YTA certainly because the figure she won were stolen.  It's not clear that she knew they were hot when she received them, but you and she now know that she's in possession of stolen property and she has absolutely no right to keep it.  There may be a poker debt to settle with the thief but that's a separate matter.", "YTA and not even debatable. Kids do stupid things, why are you enabling them?", "YTA \n\nAs soon as you were told the figures belonged to someone else, you should have handed them over. \n\nYour niece wagered an hour / ! / use of her tablet vs ownership of several expensive Star wars figures. That's not right and she needs to be told now why, or she'll continue growing up into a not too nice person. And likewise Bill needs to learn he can't wager something he doesn't own, but that's his mother's job to teach.", "YTA - The figures weren't Bill's to wager.  How is it different than if Tina took a $100 bill from your purse, or the diamond ring you left sitting on the side of the sink and bet that and lost?   The kids are 9, they didn't really know but it's a learning opportunity.  The figures aren't Tina's fair and square because they weren't Bill's to begin with.  The 12 year old \"witness\" is irrelevant and sounds like a lame attempt at excuses from you.  Return them, use this as a teaching moment and while you're at it teach yourself because the fact that, as an adult, you don't get why Bill's brother wants the figures back is also disturbing.  PS: Multiple figures at $25-$30 each that he saved up to buy with his own money IS expensive.  You don't get to decide what is and isn't expensive to another person - really just another lame excuse attempt.", "Yeah, YTA. The figures weren't Bill's to bet, which should resolve the issue about giving them back to any person with a bit of common sense: if you receive stolen property, you need to give it back.\n\nYour brother needs to talk to Tina about taking advantage of her cousin, though.

How is this even a question.", "YTA and congratulations for teaching a kid that it's ok to scam stuff off other kids, for *temporary* use of her iPad.\n\nIt's illegal to gamble or make contracts underage, plus they figures are stolen goods, so the kid doesn't have a leg to stand and needs to hand the stuff back pronto.", "YTA and think of this in terms of adults.

Bill stole the figurines. That's a crime. Sorry, your can't buy/win stolen goods and think it's okay to keep them?", "YTA. There are more than one reason, but for the sake of this post you need only one. She won stolen property, it does not matter that she won, it was not the losers property to give.

Just give the damn toys to the victim of child underground gambling.", "YTA. The older cousins should be punished too. You said Bill wanted to play with the tablet at first and not own it. The cousins then suggested to gamble the tablet at poker. This is a very serious.... Bill was also certainly pressured to gamble the figurines. \nThis is very wrong to let kids gamble things if not illegal. Even more if one of them is pressured to do so. If Tina would've lot there would have been hell bent on Bill to return the tablet.\nThe biggest AH are the cousins but you are a strong contender for the title. What's next? Letting the owner of the figurines organizing a fight club to get them back?\nSeriously what's wrong with people....", "YTA - those toys were not Bill's to gamble with.

I would have said they need to be returned, but in exchange for something equal that actually belongs to Bill, because he lost them fair and square.\n\nAlso, back and invest in Tina. She's a hustler, she's ruthless, and will end up rich. You wanna be her favourite relative when this happens.", "YTA, and really shouldn't be left in charge of a pet rock. \n\nHow are you 28? Give the kid back his toys and stop enabling crappy behavior form your niece.", "YTA so hard.  And why are you dragging your brother in this, you are an adult and should be able to manage this on your own. \n\n1. The Star Wars figures were not Bill's to wager.  Technically, your niece is in receipt of stolen property.\n2. Your niece is a card shark who took advantage of a family member. \n3. I had to spell this out to a grown woman.", "This is a tough one.  Inclined to go with ESH.\n\nFirst off, you've got kids gambling for what is effectively real money, either through trading of property that has real value or \"rental\" time on expensive equipment.  I'm not going to try to argue one way or another whether young kids should be gambling, but it should at least be an activity that the adults responsible for them are aware of and approve of.  It's one thing to play for pennies.  It's another thing entirely to play for significantly larger amounts.  If the kids are gambling for money or property at a rate where you can lose over $25 per round, there had better be some adult oversight to that game.  Before Bill is able to bet the figures, some responsible party should have verified that they were his to gamble.\n\nThen we have Wendy.  I don't know how many figures were in the bag, but if it was enough to conceivably discover a difference in weight (which she apparently did not), then we're talking at least 10 figures, so the value of that bag is somewhere in the range of $250-300.  In no universe should Wendy have entrusted her 9 year old son to watch a bag with that much value that doesn't even belong to her.  She clearly realized she had accidentally brought it inside before she left, so she should have just taken it with her.  \n\nBill's half brother should also keep closer track of his stuff, especially stuff he spent so much money on.  \n\nI get that OP wants to get a ruling from Tina's actual parent, but that's really beside the point.  She's the adult in charge, this has happened on her watch, and she can make this decision.  And it's really a simple decision.  The figures don't belong to Tina.  They were never Bill's to give away, so she's effectively in possession of stolen property, even though she technically won them fair and square.  Sucks to be her, and she's not going to be happy about it.\n\nAs for Bill, he needs to make an appropriate compensation.  I don't think $25 per figure is appropriate, but Wendy should know what some of HIS prized possessions are and offer them up in exchange, maybe allowing Tina to choose something of his.  And without appropriate compensation, I wouldn't allow Bill back over.\n\nOR.. maybe tell Tina it sucks to be her, but this should never have happened.  Return the figures, and shut down the games.  No more kids playing poker if they can't do it responsibly, which they have shown they clearly can't in this instance.  Sorry, but pre-teens shouldn't be driving this ethical crisis.  Be the adults in this situation.", "Wow I get to go against the grain!\n\nNTA because it's entirely reasonable to have the father handle the issue and make the decisions himself when he becomes available.

Just gotta tell her stepson she's sorry for causing the inconvenience.\n\nThe aunt is T A for trying to pressure op into not consulting her brother. The aunt is also T A for failing to teach her son that you don't give away things you don't even own. If he broke or lost them the blame would also obviously be on him, no?", "NTA. It's surprising how you're being scolded here for wanting to ask the kid's *parent* how to parent their kid. Holy crap.\n\nThat being said: the toys have to go back, they're stolen property.

You as adult and temporary caretaker can make such decision and honestly all you can demand is apology from the boy to your niece.  \n\n\nThe step brother here is being screwed big time by kids who don't know any better and one adult who lacks the spine to make the right decision.", "IMO, you are all AHs, but Bill is the biggest AH here.  He took his little brothers toys, gambled and lost them, then hid the fact until little bro righteously threw a fit.  THEN, he rats out Tina, as if SHE did something wrong by winning some toys.  The kid sounds like an all around weasel.  Tina is kinda slightly an AH for not sharing her tablet, although I kinda understand since Bill sounds like the kind of kid you don't want to hand anything valuable to.  Wendy has AH on herself as well for letting Bill run amok and not making Bill make amends to both Tina and little bro.\n\nOP is mostly in the clear, IMO, as she is just a temp in this circus.  However, its pretty clear to everyone that Tina needs to give the toys back, as the little bro is 100% a victim here.", "Maybe I'm clueless but I don't agree with everyone calling you the AH. \n\nI can see their point of view, gambling with stolen property is wrong and the kids whose items were stolen deserves to have his things returned.\n\nHowever, I don't understand why your nice should be punished for that. She didn't know the items were stolen, she won them fairly. Equally, it's fair for you to want to speak to her father about this to ensure he agrees about whether she should be punished for participating in gambling.\n\nIn my opinion, the child who stole the items to gamble with in the hopes of getting time on the tablet should be the one being punished. His mother should have apologised not accused. I would also have assumed he would have to give something of his to your niece in exchange for the items he stole, or perhaps his allowance could be garnished or something. But since he was the one who stole, imo he is the one who should be rectifying the situation. \n\nYes, the niece needs to return the items, however if she returns the items and he doesn't get punished/she receives nothing to replace it then what is your niece learning? That even if she plays fairly, if people don't like the outcome, they will force their chosen outcome on her.\n\nAgain, I would probably have a conversation about the appropriateness of gambling however I fully agree with your decision that you needed to check in with her father. At the end of the day, it's a big moral life lesson being discussed and his input is important. \n\nI didn't see you say you were not planning to give the items back, you simply wanted to speak to her father first about everything, which I think people need to put themselves in the fathers shoes. If you found out your daughter had done this and then was punished or not punished without it being discussed with you, how would you feel? So I say NTA.", "I mean... it\u2019s clear isn\u2019t it?

Bill was probably not even understanding the consequences of his actions, it's your role as an adult to make sure the toys are given back to their owner. 25-30$ is a lot for a figurine, especially for a child. \nBill needs to be taught not to gamble in general and with his brother's toys especially. Tina in my view didn't really do anything wrong, if anything it's the cousins that set this up, but explain to her why her behaviour is not ok here and how this affects the other people involved. \nYTA tending to NAH, depending on whether you've previously had to babysit kids before or not, since this could just be your own lack of experience with this kind of situations.", "[removed]", "The toys should go back. \n\nHowever, Tina needs compensation, Wendy needs to figure out a comfortable exchange otherwise Bill may make make a habit of giving up his stepbrothers possessions.", "Nice to teach kids to gamble.\n\nThere's good reason for it to be illegal in most parts of the world.", "ESH - the cousins for wagering property not belong to them , OP for prolonging a situation without finding alternatives.\n\nThese kids need to be monitored by an adult \u2026 \n\nHowever , Bill and his mother need to pay the value of the items to Tina as she did win .

However, I would argue that it is still a permanent hour of her time that is being wagered. Maybe she has a screen time limit daily, but even if not, she likely doesn't just get unlimited time with the tablet.  She is still allowing the use of her expensive tech that she doesn't have to share at all in the first place. It's like renting technology; there is still a monetary value.\n\nTina likely knew that the toys shouldn't be wagered. She already did not want to share the tablet, and was probably pressured in to the wager. So she asked for something she figured Billy wouldn't be so brazen to actually wager, seeing as they weren't his.  That would have shut down him begging for a turn on the tablet.  But Billy made the choice to wager something THAT WAS NOT HIS.\n\nBilly needs to repay his brother and learn from this poor decision.\n\nHis mother is panicking, trying to keep peace and not upset her older son.

Probably,  but he could have refused the stake and accepted he wouldn't ge to play with Tina's tablet.  Staking permanent ownership for an experience is a regular part of life.

The reality is that Bill should be replacing the toys because he stole them, not Tina. Tina has not done anything wrong, and mom and son need to address the theft and then the subsequent betting. Not Tina. Accountability is the most important when teaching young children ethical values and behaviours.

It's obvious these figures were wagered by the wrong kid.  But for some reason, even as an adult, you are thinking like a 9 year old.\n\nYou should nip this kind of behavior in the bud.

However, the bet was for goods not owned by the individual betting. Sometimes even if you win, doing the ethical thing means giving back the toys to the proper owner. People lie and scam and she needs to understand how to ethically confront these scenarios based on the culture she lives in.\n\nBill stole items and he needs to understand respecting other individuals property. That one is pretty obvious.\n\nThe older cousins shouldn't be goading the younger children into taking bets.\n\nAll the kids should not be gambling for permanent ownership of anything without checking with an adult. While I think it's important for children to learn ownership, really their stuff mostly belongs to their parents at this stage. They are still learning what is appropriate to bet or give away. For example, no betting the pets, younger siblings, a bed, a TV ... Kids are still learning value and need guidance here.\n\nLastly, all the adults leave something to be desired here. I really hope all of these conversations are happening outside of the children's hearing.

While others may not like the concept that Tina is receiving stolen goods - she did no wrong. Many casinos around the world would not give money back to ANYONE if they came claiming their spouse, brother, friend, mom, dad stole the money from them. They are under no obligation to return ANYTHING TO ANYONE.\n\nPawn shops regularly receive stolen property and by law are not required to GIVE anything back. It's technically not their problem. The law will not force them to return it either. (usa) And, they are free to dispose or keep the items.\n\nSince Bill stole the figures, it is on Bill to either be punished for the theft or/and work to replace the stolen items from his brother. It would be a good life lesson for him to learn to keep his hands off other people's property, as he would have to pay to replace the items. The brother who is missing the items has learned a valuable life lesson too- his brother cannot be trusted around his property and he will need to secure them or be present when making the purchases of future figurines.\n\nAs for the Aunt. While I get that she is upset, she should replace the stolen items at her cost, since she was responsible for keeping them safe from theft in the first place. She should also require Bill to work, sell his stuff, and reimburse the mom for all the costs associated with his theft.  It would teach Bill that there are consequences for stealing and that repayment is always going to happen.\n\nIf Tina does not want to give the items back, she should not be forced to as she did win them,. However, gambling should not be allowed at a young age. It is then up to the dad on how he wants his daughter to behave.", "Y T A softly....\nThey weren't Bill's property to wager, and his brother shouldn't have to suffer a loss because of him.\n\nIf they were adults we would be talking about stolen property.\n\nTina can he disappointed, and can hope and expect Bill to find a way to make it up perhaps, but the property needs to be returned to the person that actually owns it.", "Idk. On one hand they weren't Bill's figures to wager and thus should be returned and Bill punished for stealing. On the other hand they were won fairly in a game and Bill should again be punished for stealing. And in either case the older cousins should be scolded for encouraging the whole thing. Probably also convinced Bill to accept the wager in the first place. I am the older cousin in my family and I absolutely would have encouraged my cousins.", "Basic fact, she is a minor and no able to enter into a \"contract\" with a other especially when it involves a subject she's not legally old enough to participate in ie gambling. \n\nTherefore all goods are returned to previous owners", "YTA, obviously.

They take Tina's toys? Then Bill still needs to pony up his end of the bargain. Doesn't sound like Bill is being held accountable though.  Or that Tina is getting any compensation for her winnings.", "I don\u2019t think OP should\u2019ve returned the toys. OP should defer the entire situation to the parent, which she tried to do. It\u2019s not a babysitters job to deal with anything more than the most basic disciplinary situations, nor is it an aunt or grandparents job.\n\nThere is an issue with the unfair trade, a lesson for both kids to learn here. There also an issue that the kids are gambling at all, but being that 12 year olds are regularly gambling, I\u2019m thinking this is culturally acceptable (gambling is VERY common in some cultures) if that is the case it\u2019s all the more important that a lesson be taught here, particularly to Bill for accepting a really bad deal, and for gambling something he couldn\u2019t afford to lose", "The issue at hand doesn\u2019t require immediate action, it can wait 7 hours for Dad to weigh in.", "How well it was explained, how well the cousins understood it and if they cheated? Its not unlikely for children to cheat against someone they don't like. I could imagine Bill being singled out and after not leaving them alone about the tablet they played with him and cheated.\n\nEither way there is no way children can gamble with toys and everything should be returned.", "I teach son to share and to be frank, it is considered 'the norm' to share devices around here (UK) and I find it pretty disturbing she would be so selfish as to demand hundreds of $$ worth of toys for a 60 minute 'loan' of her device, let alone stand up to an adult pointing out the wrongfully bet items should be returned. \n\nShe has no more claim to them than someone purchasing stolen goods and whilst it's a sh\\*tty situation, the should be returned to their rightful owner.\n\nBut hey, if that's the world you want to live in then keep propagating those predatory behaviours but in the bigger picture it just means there will be a bigger predator around the corner looking to take advantage of her.\n\nI'm not saying my son is a push over, but he is empathic and sympathetic to the needs of others and would rather help a na\u00efve person than rip them off.\n\nBut each to their own though I guess.", ">The only things Tina thought was worth an hour on her device were the Star Wars figures Wendy accidentally unloaded from her car and made Bill keep an eye on. So Bill wagered the figures, and he lost all but two of them to Tina, with their 12 year old cousin as their witness. Wendy then needed to hurry home and grabbed Bill, not noticing the difference in the bag.  \nThe figures were Bill's half brother who forgot the bag in Wendy's car. He was panicking when he noticed all but two of his figures are missing, so Bill was forced to tell his mom and brother what happened. Wendy asked for the figures back. They are not particularly expensive, like $25 - $30 each, but Bill's brother did save up for them.\n\nIf you can read there is nothing to analyze.\n\nIt doesn't matter what the timeframe is so please don't try to act smarter than you are.  \n\n\nIt's quite simple. Tina got stolen goods, she needs to return it to rightful owner. Nothing else matter. No analogy matters, not time frame matters.   \n\n\nOP needs to grow a spine and return the toys, instead of pushing the hard decision on someone else.", "Hmm, I guess this is just a difference of routine.  I call my siblings all the time when something happens and I am interested in talking to them about it, and I don't even have their children living with me!  It seems odd that there's be even the slightest hesitation to call, or a need to schedule regular check-ins instead of just calling when anything interesting comes up.  I mean, obviously after you've been told he's in a meeting for the next 6 hours, you don't keep calling within the next 6 hours, but after that...\n\nI agree, by the way, it's not a foregone conclusion that any of these things are the problem.  That's why there's a discussion that happens with her father, to try to understand her perspective on what happened.  Other posters have suggested that *maybe* what happened was that Tina was pressured into betting in the first place by the other kids and never wanted anything to do with this, and if that's the case, then the conversation is different, and becomes about building up confidence to stick up for her decisions, and talking to other parents about asking them to address the peer pressure issue with their kids.  It all depends.", "It\u2019s not punishing her. Yes she didn\u2019t know that the figures weren\u2019t Bill\u2019s to wager, but it\u2019s still something that shouldn\u2019t have happened and if she had lost the worst she would\u2019ve missed out on was some time on her tablet. Getting her winnings taken away isn\u2019t going to feel good, but it\u2019s by far the most fair. Also these kids should be told that they can\u2019t do stuff like this on their own, because situations like this are a risk. Maybe if the parents agree to it, but it\u2019s asking for trouble to let kids gamble their possessions to each other.", "The fact that you're still calling Bill's brother's action figures \"Tina's toys\" is truly remarkable.", "Oh im not suggesting she keep the toys, don't get me wrong.  I also don't think she knew the value of the toys the way an adult does, to a 9 year old its just cool toys.  When I say take advantage of a shitty poker player I mean raise the bet and take their chips.  In my house we play for fun/ the big reeses.  I also think that she should receive some kind of compensation for her win and if I were supervising the game..it would be an hour with the figures against an hour with the tablet.", "Ooh, getting snippy there?  A sure mark of a failing argument.  And you were being so logical, though a bit misguided, up until now.\n\nWendy *says* they toys weren't Bill's.  Very likely true, but hardly proven.\n\nAnd I would submit the time frame *does* matter.  Suppose (I know it's not the case, but suppose) a year had gone by.  Wendy is demanding Tina surrender property she won on a bet a year ago.  Would your view change, or would you still say OP should take Wendy's word decide *right now?*  Of course you'd say that makes a difference.  So it's just a matter of degree.\n\nBut, hey, you do you.  My wisdom is needed elsewhere.", "I agree she should give them back. But the aunt wants her punished. Not just them returned.", "Fair play :)"]}
