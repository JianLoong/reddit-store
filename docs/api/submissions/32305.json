Six hours of waiting is nothing.\n\nI think your brother will probably make Tina return the figures anyway, but the important thing is the reason behind why she should return the figures that she needs to learn.

You were right to let him make the decision. If Wendy can\u2019t wait 6 hours, tough luck, maybe she can take money out of Bill\u2019s allowance to pay her stepson.\n\nPersonally I think Tina should return the figures and be taught compassion, but I will never say she\u2019s wrong. Bill needs to be made responsible for his decisions. He wagers something means he\u2019s claiming ownership of it. If these things weren\u2019t his to give, that\u2019s something he has to work with the owners, his brother.

You bet on a bet, and if you lose you lose the bet.\n\nTina and Bill went into the game knowing winner takes all, and Tina won, so Bill needs to take responsibility.\n\nThat responsibility can come in the form of having his allowance reduced or doing chores to earn money to pay back his brother.\n\nHowever, I think Tina should return the figures. She needs to be taught that she\u2019s too young for gambling and that she doesn\u2019t have legal rights over the figures. This is something her father needs to teach her or if he allows you to you can. It\u2019s important that she learns that she is not wrong for thinking she is entitled to the winning, but that situations can sometimes get complicated and so she should stay away from gambling until she is older and wiser.\n\nI think Wendy is A H for trying to make Bill get out of the mess without consequences for his part.", "Honestly, the fact that she swindled her cousin into putting up permanent ownership of items in return for a shot at temporary use of her stuff is enough to be worrying by itself. Such an inclination towards being a rip off artist should, in my opinion, be nipped in the bud hard. The fact that this also involved talking him into putting up goods for the bet that they both knew didn't belong to Bill makes it way worse, though. Since unless I am greatly misreading the story it seems like her niece knew that Bill was just watching the toys for someone else and they didn't actually belong to him.", "She is the adult in charge. She absolutely does have the right to take the belongings away. She also needs to exercise common sense.", "I really don't see how you can come to the conclusion that Tina is in no way responsible for it when she is literally the one who demanded he use the toys as the wager while knowing Bill was just watching them for someone else.", "Have you ever been asked to take 24/7 custody of a child for an entire month? Because its a bit of a different fish then watching the kid for a few hours while her parents go out on a dinner date or something like that. The caretaker is indeed expected to make certain kinds of choices about the kid instead of calling their parents every time a choice more meaningful then what to make them for lunch comes into play. It kind of defeats the point of a long term caretaker to be on the phone every 5 minutes micromanaging what they do because you didn't give them any sort of flexibility to make calls on your behalf.", "How is it in any way his brother's call over whether his daughter has to return something she stole? The decision is on whether the person who was robbed wants to let it go and just let Tina keep the stuff ***and they don't.***  Her daddy has no ability to swoop in and say she owns her stolen property so his input is irrelevant. You don't own stolen property just because you bought it in good faith from someone thinking they had legal ownership when in fact they didn't. And if I am reading the story right Tina was well aware that Bill was just watching those toys as opposed to being their owner and can't even claim the 'why should I be punished for dealing in good faith by having to relinquish them, screw the loser who got robbed not my problem' argument.", "Lots of problems here for sure. Primary of which being an absent adult responsible for a pre-teen that\u2019s showing some concerning sociopathic behaviors.", "This is definitely a valid concern, but it's a bit different.\n\n* Returning the property Bill stole from his brother was obviously what needed to be done, and any responsible adult should be expected to do their part to resolve the situation.\n* Unless they have an explicit agreement about discipline, talking to Tina about her poor behavior and setting consequences for it is properly the role of her father, not her aunt who is temporarily looking after her.", "I didn't say anything about a conclusion on Tina being responsible or not, although I'd be unlikely to call a 9 yo an AH\n\nOP didn't say that Tina knew at the time that they were Bill's brothers, not Bill's toys. \n\nI believe Tina's dad should tell her she has no business gambling and make her return the toys immediately, but that doesn't mean that Wendy wasn't 100% wrong making demands on OP who was babysitting.", "You're NOT reading the story right. \n\nWe know the toys didn't belong to Bill because the OP told us.

Even if she wasn't a witness to this it seems exceedingly unlikely that Bill wouldn't give the same response most people would and say 'but those don't even belong to me' as his first reply to her asking him to wager the toys. Its not 100% impossible she didn't know it, but as described it seems way more likely then not that she was aware that he was watching them for someone else. And if not she certainly does now and her response was 'screw that loser who got robbed, they belong to me now'. There is no scenario in which she isn't a greedy brat happy to receive stolen goods.

See how it doesn't say that Tina knew that ?", "Read my post again, it doesn't matter. You are quibbling over whether she knew she was a thief when she made the bet or knows she is a thief now that she has been told they weren't Bill's toys but insists ownership has transferred to her anyway. Anyone who insists they own something they know was given to them by someone who wasn't the real owner and won't give it back to the real owner is a thief.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd don't try to tell me she is too young to understand this, either. A 9 year old is old enough to understand ownership and knows that you can't get something that belongs to person A by requesting person B give it to you. 9 year olds don't go up to random people and ask them to give them random things, they know to ask the person it belongs to.", "If it doesn\u2019t matter, why do you keep bringing it up ?  \n\n\nTina\u2019s father will manage the situation in a few hours when he is done with work.", "Because the lump of gristle I call a brain didn't spark enough neurons at once to realize it was a quibble detail until after I already brought it up and someone responded.", "YTA Those figurines were not Bill's to gamble.

The figures weren't Bill's to bet and I don't see how Tina has any right to keep them. Maybe Tina didn't know that at the time, but she knows now. Refusing to return what she now knows is stolen property is very concerning. I wonder how OP would feel if Tina took something of hers and gambled it away. Would she say whoever Tina lost it to had earned it?", "YTA certainly because the figure she won were stolen.  It's not clear that she knew they were hot when she received them, but you and she now know that she's in possession of stolen property and she has absolutely no right to keep it.  There may be a poker debt to settle with the thief but that's a separate matter.", "YTA and not even debatable. Kids do stupid things, why are you enabling them?", "YTA \n\nAs soon as you were told the figures belonged to someone else, you should have handed them over. \n\nYour niece wagered an hour / ! / use of her tablet vs ownership of several expensive Star wars figures. That's not right and she needs to be told now why, or she'll continue growing up into a not too nice person. And likewise Bill needs to learn he can't wager something he doesn't own, but that's his mother's job to teach.", "YTA - The figures weren't Bill's to wager.  How is it different than if Tina took a $100 bill from your purse, or the diamond ring you left sitting on the side of the sink and bet that and lost?   The kids are 9, they didn't really know but it's a learning opportunity.  The figures aren't Tina's fair and square because they weren't Bill's to begin with.  The 12 year old \"witness\" is irrelevant and sounds like a lame attempt at excuses from you.  Return them, use this as a teaching moment and while you're at it teach yourself because the fact that, as an adult, you don't get why Bill's brother wants the figures back is also disturbing.  PS: Multiple figures at $25-$30 each that he saved up to buy with his own money IS expensive.  You don't get to decide what is and isn't expensive to another person - really just another lame excuse attempt.", "Yeah, YTA. The figures weren't Bill's to bet, which should resolve the issue about giving them back to any person with a bit of common sense: if you receive stolen property, you need to give it back.\n\nYour brother needs to talk to Tina about taking advantage of her cousin, though.

How is this even a question.", "YTA and congratulations for teaching a kid that it's ok to scam stuff off other kids, for *temporary* use of her iPad.\n\nIt's illegal to gamble or make contracts underage, plus they figures are stolen goods, so the kid doesn't have a leg to stand and needs to hand the stuff back pronto.", "YTA and think of this in terms of adults.

Bill stole the figurines. That's a crime. Sorry, your can't buy/win stolen goods and think it's okay to keep them?", "YTA. There are more than one reason, but for the sake of this post you need only one. She won stolen property, it does not matter that she won, it was not the losers property to give.

Just give the damn toys to the victim of child underground gambling.", "YTA. The older cousins should be punished too. You said Bill wanted to play with the tablet at first and not own it. The cousins then suggested to gamble the tablet at poker. This is a very serious.... Bill was also certainly pressured to gamble the figurines. \nThis is very wrong to let kids gamble things if not illegal. Even more if one of them is pressured to do so. If Tina would've lot there would have been hell bent on Bill to return the tablet.\nThe biggest AH are the cousins but you are a strong contender for the title. What's next? Letting the owner of the figurines organizing a fight club to get them back?\nSeriously what's wrong with people....", "YTA - those toys were not Bill's to gamble with.

I would have said they need to be returned, but in exchange for something equal that actually belongs to Bill, because he lost them fair and square.\n\nAlso, back and invest in Tina. She's a hustler, she's ruthless, and will end up rich. You wanna be her favourite relative when this happens.", "YTA, and really shouldn't be left in charge of a pet rock. \n\nHow are you 28? Give the kid back his toys and stop enabling crappy behavior form your niece.", "YTA so hard.  And why are you dragging your brother in this, you are an adult and should be able to manage this on your own. \n\n1. The Star Wars figures were not Bill's to wager.  Technically, your niece is in receipt of stolen property.\n2. Your niece is a card shark who took advantage of a family member. \n3. I had to spell this out to a grown woman.", "This is a tough one.  Inclined to go with ESH.\n\nFirst off, you've got kids gambling for what is effectively real money, either through trading of property that has real value or \"rental\" time on expensive equipment.  I'm not going to try to argue one way or another whether young kids should be gambling, but it should at least be an activity that the adults responsible for them area aware of and approve of.  It's one thing to play for pennies.  It's another thing entirely to play for significantly larger amounts.  If the kids are gambling for money or property at a rate where you can lose over $25 per round, there had better be some adult oversight to that game.  Before Bill is able to bet the figures, some responsible party should have verified that they were his to gamble.\n\nThen we have Wendy.  I don't know how many figures were in the bag, but if it was enough to conceivably discover a difference in weight (which she apparently did not), then we're talking at least 10 figures, so the value of that bag is somewhere in the range of $250-300.  In no universe should Wendy have entrusted her 9 year old son to watch a bag with that much value that doesn't even belong to her.  She clearly realized she had accidentally brought it inside before she left, so she should have just taken it with her.  \n\nBill's half brother should also keep closer track of his stuff, especially stuff he spent so much money on.  \n\nI get that OP wants to get a ruling from Tina's actual parent, but that's really beside the point.  She's the adult in charge, this has happened on her watch, and she can make this decision.  And it's really a simple decision.  The figures don't belong to Tina.  They were never Bill's to give away, so she's effectively in possession of stolen property, even though she technically won them fair and square.  Sucks to be her, and she's not going to be happy about it.\n\nAs for Bill, he needs to make an appropriate compensation.  I don't think $25 per figure is appropriate, but Wendy should know what some of HIS prized possessions are and offer them up in exchange, maybe allowing Tina to choose something of his.  And without appropriate compensation, I wouldn't allow Bill back over.\n\nOR.. maybe tell Tina it sucks to be her, but this should never have happened.  Return the figures, and shut down the games.  No more kids playing poker if they can't do it responsibly, which they have shown they clearly can't in this instance.  Sorry, but pre-teens shouldn't be driving this ethical crisis.  Be the adults in this situation.", "Wow I get to go against the grain!\n\nNTA because it's entirely reasonable to have the father handle the issue and make the decisions himself when he becomes available. This is about kids toys so it is in no way time sensitive. The aunt can easily wait for a day to have this resolved. Just gotta tell her stepson she's sorry for causing the inconvenience.\n\nThe aunt is T A for trying to pressure op into not consulting her brother. The aunt is also T A for failing to teach her son that you don't give away things you don't even own. If he broke or lost them the blame would also obviously be on him, no?", "NTA. It's surprising how you're being scolded here for wanting to ask the kid's *parent* how to parent their kid. Holy crap.\n\nThat being said: the toys have to go back, they're stolen property. Bill's mom should offer Tina something in trade that she can teach him a lesson with, like allowance she can make him work off, so that he learns a lesson. From your story this conversation went well off the rails and waiting for a parent call and some cooler heads should help.", "YTA.  \n\n\nGambling for minors is prohibited everywhere as far as I know and the poker game counts as gambling because something of a real world value was wagered - just 2-3 figurines priced at 25-30 bucks stack up in value really fast.  \n\n\nThe wager was a stole property so it should be returned to the rightful owner. You as adult and temporary caretaker can make such decision and honestly all you can demand is apology from the boy to your niece.  \n\n\nThe step brother here is being screwed big time by kids who don't know any better and one adult who lacks the spine to make the right decision.", "IMO, you are all AHs, but Bill is the biggest AH here.  He took his little brothers toys, gambled and lost them, then hid the fact until little bro righteously threw a fit.  THEN, he rats out Tina, as if SHE did something wrong by winning some toys.  The kid sounds like an all around weasel.  Tina is kinda slightly an AH for not sharing her tablet, although I kinda understand since Bill sounds like the kind of kid you don't want to hand anything valuable to.  Wendy has AH on herself as well for letting Bill run amok and not making Bill make amends to both Tina and little bro.\n\nOP is mostly in the clear, IMO, as she is just a temp in this circus.  However, its pretty clear to everyone that Tina needs to give the toys back, as the little bro is 100% a victim here.", "Maybe I'm clueless but I don't agree with everyone calling you the AH. \n\nI can see their point of view, gambling with stolen property is wrong and the kids whose items were stolen deserves to have his things returned.\n\nHowever, I don't understand why your nice should be punished for that. She didn't know the items were stolen, she won them fairly. Equally, it's fair for you to want to speak to her father about this to ensure he agrees about whether she should be punished for participating in gambling.\n\nIn my opinion, the child who stole the items to gamble with in the hopes of getting time on the tablet should be the one being punished. His mother should have apologised not accused. I would also have assumed he would have to give something of his to your niece in exchange for the items he stole, or perhaps his allowance could be garnished or something. But since he was the one who stole, imo he is the one who should be rectifying the situation. \n\nYes, the niece needs to return the items, however if she returns the items and he doesn't get punished/she receives nothing to replace it then what is your niece learning? That even if she plays fairly, if people don't like the outcome, they will force their chosen outcome on her.\n\nAgain, I would probably have a conversation about the appropriateness of gambling however I fully agree with your decision that you needed to check in with her father. At the end of the day, it's a big moral life lesson being discussed and his input is important. \n\nI didn't see you say you were not planning to give the items back, you simply wanted to speak to her father first about everything, which I think people need to put themselves in the fathers shoes. If you found out your daughter had done this and then was punished or not punished without it being discussed with you, how would you feel? So I say NTA.", "I mean... it\u2019s clear isn\u2019t it? They should be returned. YTA, just make a new deal. In lieu of Tins having to forfeit her winnings, bill or Bob or whatever, must give Tina XYZ (make her cookies, clean her room \nA toy of his own, etc.).", "YTA\n\n1) Gambling outside of casino's is technically illegal more places then it is legal, way, way, way more places(police still raid poker night amongst friends). Secondly, the terms are hyper predatory.   \n\n\nGranted, I'm glad your niece wasn't willing to bet permanent ownership of a tablet pc for a far cheaper figurine, but still, the whole thing is just bad, bad, bad, bad.", "OP, they're 9 year olds. Bill was probably not even understanding the consequences of his actions, it's your role as an adult to make sure the toys are given back to their owner. 25-30$ is a lot for a figurine, especially for a child. \nBill needs to be taught not to gamble in general and with his brother's toys especially. Tina in my view didn't really do anything wrong, if anything it's the cousins that set this up, but explain to her why her behaviour is not ok here and how this affects the other people involved. \nYTA tending to NAH, depending on whether you've previously had to babysit kids before or not, since this could just be your own lack of experience with this kind of situations.", "Are you stupid? YTA", "The toys should go back. \n\nHowever, Tina needs compensation, Wendy needs to figure out a comfortable exchange otherwise Bill may make make a habit of giving up his stepbrothers possessions.", "Nice to teach kids to gamble.\n\nThere's good reason for it to be illegal in most parts of the world.", "ESH - the cousins for wagering property not belong to them , OP for prolonging a situation without finding alternatives.\n\nThese kids need to be monitored by an adult \u2026 \n\nHowever , Bill and his mother need to pay the value of the items to Tina as she did win . Or they need to replace the won items with something else Tina can have . \n\nBill needs to be taught that you don\u2019t gamble using other peoples property as collateral. \n\nTina needs to learn that when you gamble , your winnings tend to go as quick as they come .", "I'll get ripped apart but here goes. NTA. You aren't Tina's parent; her dad needs to handle this situation. This clears you totally.  Next, it's Billy's fault.  He should have to work and repay his older brother for the figures.  He was told to watch the bag, and knew fully they were not his in any way shape or form, so he wasn't even betting with something rest had worth to him.\n\nI see lots of comments saying that TINA is some awful child for betting temporary hour of yime for a permanent toy.  However, I would argue that it is still a permanent hour of her time that is being wagered. Maybe she has a screen time limit daily, but even if not, she likely doesn't just get unlimited time with the tablet.  She is still allowing the use of her expensive tech that she doesn't have to share at all in the first place. It's like renting technology; there is still a monetary value.\n\nTina likely knew that the toys shouldn't be wagered. She already did not want to share the tablet, and was probably pressured in to the wager. So she asked for something she figured Billy wouldn't be so brazen to actually wager, seeing as they weren't his.  That would have shut down him begging for a turn on the tablet.  But Billy made the choice to wager something THAT WAS NOT HIS.\n\nBilly needs to repay his brother and learn from this poor decision.\n\nHis mother is panicking, trying to keep peace and not upset her older son.  She should be given some grace.\n\nUltimately, this is for Tina's dad and Billy's mother to handle together. You aren't in a position to make major judgment like this.", "ESH. What were the parents thinking?", "Yta. Apologize to your daughter, give the figures back and have those kids stop running an illegal casino", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHis is something their parents need to decide.

Left by Wendy with her kid.", "NTA\nTge y t a are wild.", "NTA - Bill needs to learn to play better & win them back. It\u2019s part of the fun.", "Esh. They weren\u2019t Bill\u2019s to bet away. He effectively stole them and the decent thing to do would be return them. \nBut I appreciate your waiting for her dad as it\u2019s not really your decision what his child does. Wendy lives local and should just wait until the end of the day.", "You need to ask yourself, would you have this same entitled to the toys because she won at poker attitude if Tina lost her tablet to Bill.", "Yeah, soft YTA. Niece needs to return the property that Bill stole to gamble. They\u2019re 9, so I think this is a a good lesson to be learned for both of them. Also, sounds like the older cousins need a sit down to discuss what is appropriate to teach the younger cousins (nothing wrong with the poker itself, but the wagers they bet needed adult intervention here).", "If your small child comes home with random toys you call the parents of the kids they have been playing with and check that that was okay. Kids are stupid and will give away important or expensive things without fully realising the consequences and your role as an adult is to make sure they don't screw up too badly.

And that's even without taking into account the fact the toys in question were stolen.", "Yes, YTA.", "YTA without a doubt. They weren't Bill's toys to wager. Be an adult and tell her to return them.

Wtf, the decision was obvious, you can't let children play poker and bet their valuables. It's as simple as that. And Tina is a little scammy girl", "YTA.

If you want to use my car for an hour and I say \u2018sure, give me \u20ac50\u2019 that\u2019s the same concept, exchange of temporary rights for a transfer of assets.

Let\u2019s say I play you at poker, you wager \u20ac50 and I wager an hour driving my Ferrari, am I swindling you? No. I am offering temporary use of an expensive item, and you permanent use of a cheap item.

Bill wanted something of Tina's. Tina didn't want to give it to him.  \n\nIt was the  older cousins who introduced the idea of making what Bill wanted the stake in a poker game,  not Tina. (These older kids are definitely some of the AHs here)\n\nTina obviously wanted Bill to put up a stake of equal value.\n\nDid Bill over value 1hr of tablet time?  Probably,  but he could have refused the stake and accepted he wouldn't ge to play with Tina's tablet.  Staking permanent ownership for an experience is a regular part of life.  We may not barter physical property at ticket booths, but people choose to exchange assets for temporary experiences like 90 minutes watching a screen all the time. \n\nIt's not clear to me that Tina knew the figures weren't Bill's. However, Bill absolutely knew they weren't his and shouldn't have put them on the table. Bill was in a no lose situation - if he won the game, he got the tablet time(the thing he wanted).  If he lost the game, he didn't lose anything he valued. Bill is another AH in this story. \n\nWendy is also an AH. She wasn't paying sufficient attention to whose stuff was dropped with whom,  then expected a child to watch his (step)brother's stuff instead of just taking it back to the car.  NBD, it happens. But trying to bully OP into fixing the outcome of the problem she contributed to is where she becomes the AH. \n\nI think OP is right to wait a few hours to let the father get involved.  He'll have much more insight into the wider family dynamics that might be underlying some of this and may want to weigh in about his child playing poker for anything other than fun.

I just also realized it really stupid to argue in circles about it with someone who disagrees since its not like it actually changes much whether she found out she was trafficking in stolen goods earlier in the day or later in the day. Since either way she still insists on refusing to return it to the rightful owner and is thus a thief regardless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, what do you mean 'defend themselves'?
