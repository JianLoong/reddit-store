I WFH so I temporarily moved to my brother's house to look after her. Tina's mother passed away but her maternal grandparents live in the same neighborhood. My brother told me they visit the grandparents weekly and sometimes Tina will play with the cousins as her aunt and uncle also often visit her grandparents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTina has plenty of toys. She is also tidy and usually picks up after herself, so I  don't really know what toys she has. Just a few hours ago, Tina's aunt, Wendy, dropped by with her son, Bill (9m), and asked Tina to return some figures that were her stepson's. I asked Tina for them but she refused, saying she won the figures in their poker game and was entitled to it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently their older cousins played poker together at their grandparents and taught the younger ones to play as well. Tina said that Bill wanted to play with her tablet but she refused. The older cousins then suggested they played poker for it, an hour on Tina's tablet vs something Bill has that Tina would want in return. The only things Tina thought was worth an hour on her device were the Star Wars figures Wendy accidentally unloaded from her car and made Bill keep an eye on. So Bill wagered the figures, and he lost all but two of them to Tina, with their 12 year old cousin as their witness. Wendy then needed to hurry home and grabbed Bill, not noticing the difference in the bag.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe figures were Bill's half brother who forgot the bag in Wendy's car. He was panicking when he noticed all but two of his figures are missing, so Bill was forced to tell his mom and brother what happened. Wendy asked for the figures back. They are not particularly expensive, like $25 - $30 each, but Bill's brother did save up for them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTina refused to give them back, saying she won them fair and square and their cousin was the witness to the game. Wendy said she couldn't hold a child poker game responsible for loss of actual properties and that Tina needs to return the figures. I offered to call my brother and did but his coworker picked up and said my brother was in a very important meeting and people not directly involved could not interrupt. As my brother forgot his phone, he would be unreachable until the end of the meeting, 6 or 7 hours from now. So I left a message asking him to call me back. I told Wendy we would have to wait for my brother to make his decision. As for now, Tina would keep the figures until her father said otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWendy said she did not have 6 hours to wait. She said I should be able to see how messed up this is and make Tina return the figures. Again, I refused to make her, saying I personally think Tina earn the figures and my brother is the only one who can make Tina return them. Wendy called me AH for stealing and as she could not wait around took her son back, saying she will call later.

She doesn't have the right to make Tina give away things she believes she owns.  She doesn't have the right to make rulings regarding what property Tina owns.

If anything, it might teach Bill to be more careful of what he wagers.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nSomeone should be reprimanding the older cousins for instructing the 9 yo\u2019s to gamble, setting up the stakes and letting the grandparents know what happened.   \n\n\nWendy needs to be A LOT more focused on the fact that she allowed Bill to play with/watch over her other son\u2019s toys and that Bill chose to gamble them away rather than having angry outbursts at people who were in no way responsible for this mishap.\n\nThis is for Tina\u2019s dad to handle.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know how close you are to your niece, but if I babysit, I\u2019m there to make sure the kids are fed, clothed, clean, and in good health. Anything other than that is completely above my pay grade and will be given to the parents to decide. So yeah. Totally your brother\u2019s call. Six hours of waiting is nothing.\n\nI think your brother will probably make Tina return the figures anyway, but the important thing is the reason behind why she should return the figures that she needs to learn. Again, something your brother needs to take care of himself.", "NTA  Tina won them fair and square. Wendy should actually be making Bill buy new ones for his half brother because he stole them then gambled them away.", "NTA\n\nThis is totally your brother\u2019s call. You were right to let him make the decision. If Wendy can\u2019t wait 6 hours, tough luck, maybe she can take money out of Bill\u2019s allowance to pay her stepson.\n\nPersonally I think Tina should return the figures and be taught compassion, but I will never say she\u2019s wrong. Bill needs to be made responsible for his decisions. He wagers something means he\u2019s claiming ownership of it. If these things weren\u2019t his to give, that\u2019s something he has to work with the owners, his brother. It\u2019s totally not Tina\u2019s responsibility to check.\n\nCall me jaded, but next time Tina plays poker, tells her to always check if the other party can actually pay up.", "NTA\n\nIn the words of Joey from Friends: A bet is a bet. You bet on a bet, and if you lose you lose the bet.\n\nTina and Bill went into the game knowing winner takes all, and Tina won, so Bill needs to take responsibility.\n\nThat responsibility can come in the form of having his allowance reduced or doing chores to earn money to pay back his brother.\n\nHowever, I think Tina should return the figures. She needs to be taught that she\u2019s too young for gambling and that she doesn\u2019t have legal rights over the figures. This is something her father needs to teach her or if he allows you to you can. It\u2019s important that she learns that she is not wrong for thinking she is entitled to the winning, but that situations can sometimes get complicated and so she should stay away from gambling until she is older and wiser.\n\nI think Wendy is A H for trying to make Bill get out of the mess without consequences for his part.", "Honestly, the fact that she swindled her cousin into putting up permanent ownership of items in return for a shot at temporary use of her stuff is enough to be worrying by itself. Such an inclination towards being a rip off artist should, in my opinion, be nipped in the bud hard. The fact that this also involved talking him into putting up goods for the bet that they both knew didn't belong to Bill makes it way worse, though. Since unless I am greatly misreading the story it seems like her niece knew that Bill was just watching the toys for someone else and they didn't actually belong to him.", "She is the adult in charge. She absolutely does have the right to take the belongings away. She also needs to exercise common sense.", "I really don't see how you can come to the conclusion that Tina is in no way responsible for it when she is literally the one who demanded he use the toys as the wager while knowing Bill was just watching them for someone else.", "Have you ever been asked to take 24/7 custody of a child for an entire month? Because its a bit of a different fish then watching the kid for a few hours while her parents go out on a dinner date or something like that. The caretaker is indeed expected to make certain kinds of choices about the kid instead of calling their parents every time a choice more meaningful then what to make them for lunch comes into play. It kind of defeats the point of a long term caretaker to be on the phone every 5 minutes micromanaging what they do because you didn't give them any sort of flexibility to make calls on your behalf.", "How is it in any way his brother's call over whether his daughter has to return something she stole? The decision is on whether the person who was robbed wants to let it go and just let Tina keep the stuff ***and they don't.***  Her daddy has no ability to swoop in and say she owns her stolen property so his input is irrelevant. You don't own stolen property just because you bought it in good faith from someone thinking they had legal ownership when in fact they didn't. And if I am reading the story right Tina was well aware that Bill was just watching those toys as opposed to being their owner and can't even claim the 'why should I be punished for dealing in good faith by having to relinquish them, screw the loser who got robbed not my problem' argument.", "Lots of problems here for sure. Primary of which being an absent adult responsible for a pre-teen that\u2019s showing some concerning sociopathic behaviors.", "This is definitely a valid concern, but it's a bit different.\n\n* Returning the property Bill stole from his brother was obviously what needed to be done, and any responsible adult should be expected to do their part to resolve the situation.\n* Unless they have an explicit agreement about discipline, talking to Tina about her poor behavior and setting consequences for it is properly the role of her father, not her aunt who is temporarily looking after her.", "I didn't say anything about a conclusion on Tina being responsible or not, although I'd be unlikely to call a 9 yo an AH\n\nOP didn't say that Tina knew at the time that they were Bill's brothers, not Bill's toys. \n\nI believe Tina's dad should tell her she has no business gambling and make her return the toys immediately, but that doesn't mean that Wendy wasn't 100% wrong making demands on OP who was babysitting.", "You're NOT reading the story right. \n\nWe know the toys didn't belong to Bill because the OP told us. She did not write that Tina understood that. \n\nTina DID NOT STEAL.  She looked at it as she won the toys, fair and square. Her father needs to talk to her about rules for gambling(i.e., you're 9, you're not allowed to do that).  That's dad's responsibility.", ">Apparently their older cousins played poker together at their grandparents and taught the younger ones to play as well. Tina said that Bill wanted to play with her tablet but she refused.

Wendy then needed to hurry home and grabbed Bill, not noticing the difference in the bag.\n\nWe have no reason to think that Tina was not aware that those toys were something Bill's mom told him to watch after she brought them by accident. Even if she wasn't a witness to this it seems exceedingly unlikely that Bill wouldn't give the same response most people would and say 'but those don't even belong to me' as his first reply to her asking him to wager the toys. Its not 100% impossible she didn't know it, but as described it seems way more likely then not that she was aware that he was watching them for someone else. And if not she certainly does now and her response was 'screw that loser who got robbed, they belong to me now'. There is no scenario in which she isn't a greedy brat happy to receive stolen goods. The moment she was told they were stolen and refused to give them back she became a thief at heart.", "Yes, read that again. See how it doesn't say that Tina knew that ?", "Read my post again, it doesn't matter. You are quibbling over whether she knew she was a thief when she made the bet or knows she is a thief now that she has been told they weren't Bill's toys but insists ownership has transferred to her anyway. Anyone who insists they own something they know was given to them by someone who wasn't the real owner and won't give it back to the real owner is a thief.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd don't try to tell me she is too young to understand this, either. A 9 year old is old enough to understand ownership and knows that you can't get something that belongs to person A by requesting person B give it to you. 9 year olds don't go up to random people and ask them to give them random things, they know to ask the person it belongs to.", "If it doesn\u2019t matter, why do you keep bringing it up ?  \n\n\nTina\u2019s father will manage the situation in a few hours when he is done with work.", "Because the lump of gristle I call a brain didn't spark enough neurons at once to realize it was a quibble detail until after I already brought it up and someone responded."]}
