I was suprised when I saw 2 people who were matches to be grandparents in my results, I decided to try to contact them and ended up finding them, contatcing them and they were excited to hear about me. My adoptive parents were supportive of me meeting my biological family. \r  \n\r  \nEver since then, I've become close to my biological dad's side of the family. I found out my dad  and mom had me at 15 and that's why I was put up for adoption. My dad lives in Australia, so I haven't met him but I do call him everyday. I also transferred to a college near my biological family.\r  \n\r  \nMy grandparents have 8 other children, my uncles and aunts range in age from 30 to 11, with my dad (36) being their oldest child, who they had at 16 themselves. \r  \n\r  \nI have become really close to my 13 y/o uncle, Denton. Denton and I both play baseball, I play for my college and he plays for his middle school. No one else in the family plays sports, so he was very excited when I became a part of his life. Due to being close in age, it feels like we're more like brothers than uncle/nephew, espically since I'm the older one. I couldn't have asked for a better relationship with him and we've become very close.\r  \n\r  \nDenton's youngest borther and my youngest uncle is his brother Nelson, who is 11. I'd say Nelson is a complex person: he's very smart, loves to learn and read, has a passion for stuff like Model UN and other things. However, he's also not the nicest person. He says some very bigoted things including calling girls \"unintellegent\", using the n word, using the f slur, ect. The only person I've seen attempt to call him out is Denton, as my other aunts/uncles and grandparents seem to just dismiss it as him being \"stressed\" or \"a typical middle schooler\" or some other excuse. I've held my tounge because I don't want to hurt my relationship with my family.\r  \n\r  \nOn Monday, Nelson and his friends got their harshest punishment yet from school and were suspended for a week after using slurs at a gay classmate, and the boys missed some model UN conference because of it. \r  \n\r  \nNelson was crying, saying that he did nothing wrong. Most of the family was consoling him, while Denton was rubbing it in his face. Denton said this was \"karma\" and wished that his brother's punishment was longer. My grandparents asked me to tell Denton to stop, because he listens to me more than them and I've helped them to get him clean his room or do his other chores. I refused this time and told them that Nelson did deserve this punishment. I ended up taking Denton out for dinner to get him away from all of this. When I got back, my grandparents told me they were \"dissapointed\" in me, and my uncles/aunts didn't seem happy either. They said I should \"act like an adult\" bc I'm 21. Thankfully, it hasn't hurt any relationship I've had (besides w Nelson) too much.

Talking and telling off people with closed ears will just not work.\n\nYou know how else can you get the point across?

Don\u2019t toss your adopted family for this lot. They\u2019re the ones who raised you (your actual family), bio family\u2019s actions are questionable ignoring a kid\u2019s bigoted behavior.

You were the only responsible adult in the room!", "Nelson doesn't behave like a typical middle schooler.  He does, however, behave like a typical bigot... one that's going to get into more and more trouble as other people get tired of his behaviour.\n\nNTA. You ARE one of the few people behaving responsibly here.The (only) other one is Denton.\n\nBTW... you might want to consider the very strong possibility that the rest of the family dismisses Nelson's behaviour because they're bigots too.  Denton might be the only non-bigot in the family.", "NTA. it's clear who the favoured child is among that family. You are action as an adult. Nelson was doing thing that should not be doing IE using slurs especially against another student/classmate.", "ESH\nBut hear me out on this one. Sure, you're 21, older and an adult. You have your opinions and alike, but don't you really see what's going on here? Noone seems to be talking to Nelson like they should be:\nthe parents are nurturing him when he's doing something bad.\nMeanwhile you and Denton are there to basically say that he deserves this.\n\nWithout further context and communication, do you really think that this is actually helping Nelson in any way? They should all explain to him what's going on and why this is happening. Everyone should be hard on the boundaries, but still forgiving.\nThis sounds like you guys really aren't doing Nelson a favor by either being too soft or too hard. And that's what should be expected crom really anyone around him. Nelson fcked up. Help him learn his lesson, but not by being mean... Help him understand. That's what an actual adult should do in this situation.", "NTA- Racist comments should NEVER BE TOLERATED. Frankly if they don't do something about it now, then Nelson will have a lot more problems on the Horizon!", "Not with his family saying he's doing nothing wrong... probably because they're just as bad as him.  He'll just consider himself the victim.", "I find it incredibly hard to believe that a 11 year old got these beliefs that are completely foreign to his family's. Most likely they agree with him in substance, although they would prefer he was more \"polite\". \n\nAlso, OP, I think you made a mistake in moving so fast with your biological family. I don't know what the situation is with your adoptive parents, but going from zero to changing your life plans, talking to a man you never met daily(!) and becoming so entrenched in a family you had only biological ties a few months ago, that's just too soon. I am afraid you are in for a nasty wake-up call when you find out these people aren't as lovely as you think."]}
