Honestly, we never got along but I always tried to put up a peaceful front because my brother seemed blissfully happy with her.\n\nElla was mean to me a lot. Like A LOT. She would make comments about my weight, my makeup, and especially my dog. She hated animals and hated that I would bring my lab, Toast, to my parents or my brothers house. It always just felt like something aimed to hurt me.\n\nWhen the two got engaged she asked me to be her MOH since she has no sisters or many girl-friends and since my brother seemed thrilled, I obliged. \n\nWhat I failed to realize when I accepted the role was that to her MOH meant planning the entire wedding. Like I was booking venues, florists, jazz band, everything. Even worse she expected me to put my MY credit card down for all of it. (My brother and her are not exactly well off and since I have a well paying job I didn\u2019t mind holding the deposits but it was starting to add up to a lot.) Everytime I asked Ella about it, she would say that it would all be paid back by her parents before the wedding. \n\nWell flash forward to last week, about three weeks before the wedding and she\u2019s unbearable to be around. She can\u2019t last more than a few sentences before snapping at anyone. So when I of course brought up the money, shit hit the fan.\n \nI asked if she had received the updated receipt of everything owed when she exploded. She called me a whole line of terrible names but the one that stuck out was her saying \u201cWhat do you need the money for anyway? Your sick dog is dead now.\u201d \n\nMy beautiful Toasty died about a month before this after he fought the bravest battle with cancer. He was my soul dog and I was devastated. \n\nI blinked at her and simply left the room, having no energy to even respond to something so cruel. I went back to my car and after the 20 silent minute drive home, I parked the car and immediately called the vendors and cancelled any deposit under my card. Every. Single. One. After almost 20 calls, all that was left of her wedding was the dress and the flower arch. \n\nI texted my brother a short explanation. I told him that every vendor would be contacting him if they wished to keep their services and they were now responsible for covering everything. And that I would no longer be attending. It was a matter of minutes before my phone started to explode and I just turned it off. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and I haven\u2019t talked to anyone but my mom, who thankfully understands where I was coming from. My brother has tried to call but I just feel terrible. Both about what I did and about what she said. \n\nI know what I did was extreme but I also couldn\u2019t sit by and practically enable her cruelty anymore. I still can\u2019t help but feel bad for ruining my brother\u2019s big day. So I don\u2019t know, am I the asshole for this?", "created_utc": 1690858403, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f06oa/aita_for_cancelling_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 8727, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The comment about your dog was uncalled for and she sounds absolutely insufferable. NTA, I hope your brother breaks off the engagement", "NTA \u2026 you\u2019re my hero.", "NTA. You know that she would have never paid you back. It would have been just as easy for her to give her credit card number while the bookings were made (though that was part of her bride responsibilities as MOH doesn\u2019t equal unpaid wedding planner using her own funds).", "NTA but aren't most deposits non-refundable?", "NTA\n\nThey were never going to pay you back, it\u2019s a good thing she showed how wicked she was before you got stuck with the bill. I\u2019m sorry about your loss. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad about what you did, they shouldn\u2019t be getting married if they don\u2019t have the money. If her parents were going to pay they can put down their card for deposits. \nWhen you give family money, don\u2019t ever expect to get it back.", "NTA. I am so sorry for the stress she put you through and then to be so cruel about your dog. Good for you. You absolutely did the right. What a huge AH she is. I can't believe your brother is blinded by her. Hope he sees the light and leave.", "NTA - but tbh i doubt this is real.

She owes you money.   Attacking you because she owes you money is just tacky.   Her vicious comments add to it.  Canceling everything was perfectly reasonable.  She and your brother owe you an apology.", "NTA at all. She\u2019s cruel and awful and they both suck for not paying you back. She would be dead to me and your brother too unless he came up with a breathtakingly spectacular apology. Nobody says crap about my dog and gets away with it. Thank you for standing up for Toasty and hitting the witch where it hurts. It\u2019s the least she deserves.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to know is just when did it become the MOH/bridesmaids job to plan the wedding? I had never heard of that until coming here to Reddit. Back in my day as MOH or bridesmaid, you tried on dresses, bought the one the bride wanted, maybe had a small little bachelorette party, walked down the aisle and helped her to the bathroom when she\u2019s wearing her big dress. That was it.", "Dear OP, \nIt\u2019s good that you finally put your foot down. Reading your post, it gave me a vibe that your would be sister in law is an incredibly toxic person. You\u2019re NTA!\nAlso, your Toast is probably running around in the Dog Heaven! Sending you hugs", "NTA - It was a very high possibility that they were going to use you to pay for the entire wedding. It is about time you stood up for yourself from this horrible human being.

She was trying to hustle you AND she's mean.", "NTA. Not even a little. First, a MOH duties do NOT include planning the whole wedding and they certainly do NOT put down all the deposits and pay for the wedding. If you ask me, it sounds 100% like they were going to stiff you for the wedding. I don\u2019t believe for a minute her parents were paying for it. She was using us and I can\u2019t believe your brother can\u2019t see the kind of person she is. And I\u2019ll tell you what, fucking with the memory of my dog, well those are fighting words. I guess she fucked around and found out.", "NTA. She used and abused you and you stood up for yourself. You can't expect someone you're cruel to to plan and pay for your wedding. Maybe this will be a wake up call for your brother.", "NTA Op! I\u2019m so very sorry about Toast, you were lucky to have each other \u2764\ufe0f", "She was going to take you for all that money, and was just using you. Your brother was allowing it.

Anyone who crosses the line into disrespecting your sweet old dog deserves to be nuked. Great dog name too.", "Didn\u2019t ruin HIS big day\u2014just helped him to transition it from YOUR event to THEIR event.  He still has time to reach out to his future in-laws so they can bring out their checkbook and get everything back on track.\n\nOf course, finding a new MOH with short notice might be a toughie but considering that she didn\u2019t really seem all that close with you, I can\u2019t imagine her heart being broken all that bad.  Except now maybe she\u2019ll have to do some of the work herself.\n\nAnyone want to take bets on whether her parents would have come through with the reimbursements?", "NTA. She didn\u2019t respect you or your money. Honestly, good for you. She sounds awful, and I hope your brother dumps her.", " NTA. She was using you. She was never going to pay you back and then she takes a swipe at your dog dying. F her. You did the right thing.", "Nta. I hope you were able to get all of your money back. And I am pretty sure she was never going to pay you back the money and expect you to pay the wedding as a gift to them. I am happy you stood up for yourself.

I am so sorry for your loss OP.", "NTA She was cruel.\n\nBut you may have lost your brother with your response (it sucks that he ends up being punished too for her nastiness.

They should have had an affordable wedding instead of relying on OP.", "They aren't deposits either, it's just breaking down the price into different payments. When we put our first \"deposit\" down for the wedding venue, the planner joked that we were basically signing the marriage contract now considering how pricey weddings are.

She might have been trying to stick you with the bill and get a free wedding. I have no proof of that, but it might not be off brand given the way you\u2019ve described her.\n\nAlso, on a deeper note, you have no obligation to give any time and energy to people who treat you poorly even if they are family or in-laws. There\u2019s a \u201cjust put up with it because *insert reason*\u201d mentality sometimes in situations like this.

How DARE she invoke your sweet pup\u2019s name!!!  Especially after trying to get YOU to pay for HER wedding!  It\u2019s inconceivable. You\u2019re allowed to feel your feelings, but know she would never have paid you back. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I know you gave Toasty the best life they could have.

You were being taken advantage of, and your brother appears to have gone along with it.  I'm sorry.", "I would put a hold on your card until after the wedding.

Her comment seems to confirm this. Sounds like they still can use the vendors if THEY actually pay.

What she said was cruel and selfish, it showed that really she never had any intention of paying you back for anything. \nLet her get married in a parking lot or wherever with her flower arch and dress. It\u2019s the wedding she deserves and maybe she will consider how her actions and unkind words to others led her to where she is.", "NTA cuz she never had anyyyyyyy intention of paying you back.", "The dog comment was over the top.  Totally get that.  But to tell you the truth I would have canceled everything before any vendor deadlines unless I had a lot more reassurance that I wouldn't be on the hook for the whole shit show.", "You didn\u2019t cancel the wedding.

Clearly she\u2019s expecting you to foot the bill since she blew up when you gave the updated amount she owed you. You were probably going to get ghosted the second they said \u201cI do\u201d and be stuck with paying the various vendors the remaining balances owed them. She clearly but the hand feeding her and just expected you to take the abuse? You were clearly in the right to withdraw yourself and your credit cards from her wedding.", "NTA. You were being used and abused. You saved yourself further abuse and debt. You weren't going to get your money back. Sorry about your dog.", "NTA. The wedding wasn't cancelled. All they had to do is pay the vendors. If her parents were really going to pay, then that's not a major problem. They make 20 phone calls and put it on their cards.\n\nThe only way the wedding is cancelled was if she was going to leave you holding the bill.\n\nIf the wedding really is cancelled now, then you know that that's what *your brother* and his fiancee were going to do. What does that tell you about them both?\n\nIt would tell me to go no contact with them both.", "You did NOT ruin your brother\u2019s big day.

Honestly, stop feeling bad for standing up for yourself when your brother wouldn't. I would be so embarrassed if I were him. And this isn't a few days type of cool down she needs. It's a couple of years cool down she needs. Also, if it's legal to record convos where you are, I would. Who talks to their future family like she did to you?\n\nI'm awfully sorry about Toast.", "Kick her to the curb and I hope your bro isn't influenced by this with of a woman .

Never speak to her again.", "Here's to the memory of Toasty!\n\nAnd heck with that disrespectful twit. I wish you could have had a SIL that was kind and compassionate instead of... that.", "NTA - but you will be if we don't get an update!!!!!", "NTA. if you were going to get paid for anything, it should have been long before 3 weeks before the wedding. If they want things to happen, they can pay for those things.", "NTA, lighting a candle and pouring a mini Don Julio for Toasty <333\n\n*pouring out", "NTA and it sounds like your mom isn\u2019t a big fan of the wench either. Hopefully this opens your brother\u2019s eyes to what a crappy person he\u2019s planning to marry and cancelling everything saves him from a life of misery. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry about Toast!", "NTA. Not even close. \nYou didn't cancel the wedding. You removed yourself from a bad sitch. \n\nIf you can, i would like to see a photo of Toast.", "NTA.  My condolences for Toast.  Like many of us here, we've all lost beloved pets before, and my heart goes out to you.  From what little you have shared here it sounds like he knew he was loved.", "NTA and I agree--future SIL/brother had no intention of paying you back.  Brother's fiance had no business having you pay for everything and brother should have put an end to the way she has been treating you the first time it happened.  They sound horrible.", "NTA. Also, we would love an update to this when you're feeling up to it.", "NTA. What a nut job! Your brother is no better, allowing all that to happen. It is NOT the MOH duties to do any of what they asked of you.", "NTA- wow, you lasted a long time with that one. Good riddance.", "NTA.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you lost your Toasty. It sounds like you gave him a wonderful life! Could we see a pic of him?", "NTA- You canceled nothing, you are just not paying for a wedding that you should have been paying for in the first place.  Your FSIL had no intention of ever paying you back, there was always going to be an excuse. She just showed her true colors a little sooner than she planned.  And her glorious plan backfired!  \n\nNow your FSIL actually has to pay for her own wedding, what a concept! She may have even gotten money from your brother, parents, her parents, and other family members but choose to spend on herself or just keep it.\n\nTake yourself to a fabulous dinner on the day of the wedding. Dress up and look absolutely stunning.  Post to social media reminding people why you're not at the fiasco of a wedding.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. You brothers fianc\u00e9 can go kick rocks.", "NTA. \n\nand in fact, you didn't cancel their wedding. It seems that you did a lot of planning and when you called the vendors, you canceled yourself - but bro/evil future SIL have a couple of days to contact vendors to put their own name and credit card or payment on each item before its actually cancelled. Great! It's on them. They can pull it together in the next (past) days and put their own payment down or set up a lovely marriage at the Justice of the Peace with a dinner after at Olive Garden or Red Lobster. Everyone loves all you can eat breadsticks or cheddar bay biscuits. \n\nNo need to put up with disrespect and cruelty, ever. And especially not when you are paying the bill.", "NTA. I lost a beloved pet earlier this summer, and I would get banned from this sub for telling you how I would react if someone said something like that to me. You were being incredibly kind by putting down deposits for them, and it was likely you were never going to be repaid a single penny. Kindness costs nothing, yet your brother\u2019s fiancee couldn\u2019t even manage that. Why would you want to help someone so horrible? Let her face the consequences of her actions. \n\nToast would be proud of you for standing up for yourself and for his memory.", "NTA.  She ruined her big day by being cruel dckhead.  What a jerk.\n\nSo sorry about your loss.  Toast sounds brave and sweet.\n\nTake care, and honestly, I think you made the right move.", "NTA - I think it might be time to hear your brother out, hopefully he'll have a decent apology. But if not, you know you can walk away.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ruin your brother\u2019s big day. It sounds like he and Ella did. The vendors were going to contact him and he and Ella could work out payment. So it\u2019s on them and not your problem if they tried to buy something they can\u2019t afford.", "NTA\n\nNot at all. Thank you for standing up for yourself. \n\nSending a virtual hug, if you\u2019d like one. I had to say goodbye to my soul dog, Bobbi (Kelpie girl) a little less than 3 years ago. The pain gets more manageable, but there will always be a hollow part of me. \u201cGrief is love with nowhere to go.\u201d\n\n\u2764\ufe0f", "Overall NTA\n\nIf they want to get married they absolutely still can, and they can do it for cheap, if that's what's important to them.  \n\nI'm sorry to hear about the dog, a family member has a dog with that same name.  So sad.", "OP I\u2019m so sorry about Toast! I can\u2019t believe how vile Ella was!! Maybe the day of the wedding take some of that deposit money (if you can swing it) and bring a bunch of dog toys to a local shelter in Toasts honour? The biggest NTA that has ever NTA\u2019d", "NTA\n\nI'd also say that the bride is dumb. She seriously had the nerve to be awful to you when you're literally the one paying for her wedding??? Like how stupid can she be???", "I'm so proud of you.\n\nThat was the exact right thing to do.\n\nBesides, getting married should be about the marriage, not the wedding.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m very sorry about your dog. \n\nYou\u2019re in the clear with regards to the wedding. They were never going to pay you. It was all booked by you and presumably in your name so if you sued later she could say that it was all a gift. She\u2019s behaved horribly. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out of that abusive situation. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Fuck your (sadly) soon to be SIL and her deadbeat parents who were supposed to be paying you back - if that was ever even in the cards.", "That's a fantastic idea! With the deposit money she gets back OP could go to a nice resort, or treat herself to  Spa day.", "Brilliant idea! Maybe take a good long walk in a beautiful place, in honor of Toast.", ">  Honestly, stop feeling bad for standing up for yourself when your brother wouldn't. I would be so embarrassed if I were him.", "I Hope the brother is good and dumps the fianc\u00e9e, otherwise he\u2019s not that good of a person.", "Very true. They would never pay back. They are so entitled, and it's beyond belief.\n\nAlso, a easy way to see a person's true colours is to watch out for their response/treatment to animals. Her hate for animals and the nasty comment on OP's dog reveals how terrible she inherently is.\n\nStand your ground, OP. NTA.", "Right? Holy cow!", "Yes, in my experience as a best man there is a lot of logistical work to be done, but this was to take the load off the couple so they can focus on being hosts and getting married. For example making sure the musician got a tip (paid by the groom) before he headed off for the night, not hiring and paying him!", "Don\u2019t EVER say anything bad about someone\u2019s puppy!  Especially not to them.", "I say OP should be sitting in a lawn chair with a drink watching the pretty mushroom cloud.\n\nNTA.  And your brother owes you an explanation at the very least.", "NTA.\n\nThis is very telling. If her parents were supposed to reimburse OP for the deposits, and her cancelling them while giving the vendors the brother\u2019s contact there should not be a problem with her parents just putting down their own card or reimbursing their daughter.\n\nUnless they never intended to pay themselves of course.", "dw, a couple paragraphs from the end of the saga she said she texted him an explanation and that the demand for deposits would be starting shortly", "It's becoming clear why the bride has no friends to stand with her.", "Yes, seconded \u261d\ud83c\udffb", "\ud83c\udfafFor sure! \n\nI\u2019m wondering as well how much those lost deposits added up to\u2026..", ">Are men not supposed to pay for weddings\n\nUmmm......most cultures its either the parents (most times the brides) or the bride and groom. I have never heard of the man paying for a wedding.", "OP said FSILs parents would be handing over the money before the wedding, now I don't know about you but if I didn't have the parents details I would be taking the shortest route possible with as few \"middle men\" as possible meaning me>FSIL> FSILs parents NOT me>brother>FSIL>FSILs parents.", "Traditionally, the bride's parents pay for everything, but some consider that to be outdated now. My parents, in-laws, and ourselves roughly split the cost three ways. The maid of honor should absolutely not be using her credit to pay for everything! Nor should she be obligated to plan everything.\n\nAll both my bridesmaids had to do was plan my bachelorette (which was very low-key, because they know me), and show me a picture of the dress they planned to wear, because I had a color scheme in mind. One of them went wedding dress and shoe shopping with me (the other lives abroad). That's it.\n\nI'm not sure how OP got suckered into this, but she had every right to bail. The cruel remark about her dog was just vile.", "It depends on the law of where OP is, the language of the contract and in some cases if a vendor is willing to refund if they find another even for that day.", "I'd have thought. Brother owes her money for this travesty.", "I was guessing she canceled the service for which the deposit had been paid. Like, she told them them she wouldn\u2019t be paying the final bill, so they needed to get a new form of payment.", "I disagree, he brought that awful person into his sister's and parent's lives. He stood by while his partner mistreated and disrespected his sister, while she took advantage of her and used her for her time and money. \nHe's also reaping what he sowed. He doesn't deserve that wedding any more than his nasty fiance does.", "I don't think I'd like to leave my house or vehicle unattended during that time, unless you have room mates to keep an eye on things. That's just me, having some experience with the vindictiveness of mean people.", "I was just thinking this, use part of that credit card refund balance on yourself. Check into a spa for the day (so no one can contact you on the big day) and do some self love!\n\nNTA", "oh I know I have a dog and if anyone said a bad word, I\u2019d be like SOMEONE HOLD MY EARRINGS.", "I just love that you used twitterpated in a sentence!", "I think it\u2019s Xpated now.", "I hurt when I read the horrible thing the future sister-in-law said. That women has tar where her soul should be.", "My husband and I paid for our wedding ourselves. We split the cost of it and our honeymoon.", "She never agreed to pay for the wedding though. Her FSIL told her that her parents are funding the wedding. She\u2019s clearly lying, but the brother and FSIL can call the vendors with updated payment information and nothing will actually be canceled. It\u2019s not like every vendor immediately deleted all of the details of the booking without even talking to the bride or groom. I\u2019m sure the vendors all called to confirm the cancellation or receive new payment details. \n\nIf they don\u2019t have the money to pay the deposits (and her parents never actually agreed to cover the costs) then it\u2019s on the FSIL for lying.", "[removed]", "Exactly, you\u2019d not get a refund on the vast majority of this stuff. Sounds like a kid who has no idea how wedding planning works.", "Good point! Cameras are always a worthwhile investment anyways.", "My wife and I paid for most, but both of our parents were insistent on paying for parts of it. We let them pay for the booze (the venue allowed you to bring your own, so 1 Costco run and it was done) and a few other small things. Lol, we own a custom party supply store, so we let them pay for some supplies for our store so we didn't have to take any of our own supply\ud83e\udd23 it was really nice and sweet that they wanted to pay. But my wife and I had been together for 15 years at that point, and didn't have an issue paying.
