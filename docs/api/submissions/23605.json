Honestly, we never got along but I always tried to put up a peaceful front because my brother seemed blissfully happy with her.\n\nElla was mean to me a lot. Like A LOT. She would make comments about my weight, my makeup, and especially my dog. She hated animals and hated that I would bring my lab, Toast, to my parents or my brothers house. It always just felt like something aimed to hurt me.\n\nWhen the two got engaged she asked me to be her MOH since she has no sisters or many girl-friends and since my brother seemed thrilled, I obliged. \n\nWhat I failed to realize when I accepted the role was that to her MOH meant planning the entire wedding. Like I was booking venues, florists, jazz band, everything. Even worse she expected me to put my MY credit card down for all of it. (My brother and her are not exactly well off and since I have a well paying job I didn\u2019t mind holding the deposits but it was starting to add up to a lot.) Everytime I asked Ella about it, she would say that it would all be paid back by her parents before the wedding. \n\nWell flash forward to last week, about three weeks before the wedding and she\u2019s unbearable to be around. She can\u2019t last more than a few sentences before snapping at anyone. So when I of course brought up the money, shit hit the fan.\n \nI asked if she had received the updated receipt of everything owed when she exploded. She called me a whole line of terrible names but the one that stuck out was her saying \u201cWhat do you need the money for anyway? Your sick dog is dead now.\u201d \n\nMy beautiful Toasty died about a month before this after he fought the bravest battle with cancer. He was my soul dog and I was devastated. \n\nI blinked at her and simply left the room, having no energy to even respond to something so cruel. I went back to my car and after the 20 silent minute drive home, I parked the car and immediately called the vendors and cancelled any deposit under my card. Every. Single. One. After almost 20 calls, all that was left of her wedding was the dress and the flower arch. \n\nI texted my brother a short explanation. I told him that every vendor would be contacting him if they wished to keep their services and they were now responsible for covering everything. And that I would no longer be attending. It was a matter of minutes before my phone started to explode and I just turned it off. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and I haven\u2019t talked to anyone but my mom, who thankfully understands where I was coming from. My brother has tried to call but I just feel terrible. Both about what I did and about what she said. \n\nI know what I did was extreme but I also couldn\u2019t sit by and practically enable her cruelty anymore. I still can\u2019t help but feel bad for ruining my brother\u2019s big day.

People probably know shes a walking red flag (except your naive idiot of a brother) and a bully. Condolences abt Toast.", "I'm gathering from context that you cancelled deposits but gave some explanation so your brother had the opportunity to make a new deposit etc.\n\n\nIn that case NTA.", "NTA \n\nplease tell me your brother left her immediately once he found out.", "That women is a piece of work and if she\u2019s treating you this poorly she doesn\u2019t deserve your help. The comment about your dog was uncalled for and she sounds absolutely insufferable. NTA, I hope your brother breaks off the engagement", "NTA \u2026 you\u2019re my hero.", "NTA. You know that she would have never paid you back. It would have been just as easy for her to give her credit card number while the bookings were made (though that was part of her bride responsibilities as MOH doesn\u2019t equal unpaid wedding planner using her own funds).", "NTA but aren't most deposits non-refundable?", "NTA\n\nThey were never going to pay you back, it\u2019s a good thing she showed how wicked she was before you got stuck with the bill. I\u2019m sorry about your loss. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad about what you did, they shouldn\u2019t be getting married if they don\u2019t have the money. If her parents were going to pay they can put down their card for deposits. \nWhen you give family money, don\u2019t ever expect to get it back.", "NTA. I am so sorry for the stress she put you through and then to be so cruel about your dog. Good for you. You absolutely did the right. What a huge AH she is. I can't believe your brother is blinded by her. Hope he sees the light and leave.", "NTA - but tbh i doubt this is real. Youre trying to say you fronted the money for someone\u2019s wedding when they were and continue to be awful to you? I dont buy it.", "I\u2019m so sorry about Toast \ud83d\udc94.  NTA", "NTA.   She owes you money.   Attacking you because she owes you money is just tacky.   Her vicious comments add to it.  Canceling everything was perfectly reasonable.  She and your brother owe you an apology.", "NTA at all. She\u2019s cruel and awful and they both suck for not paying you back. She would be dead to me and your brother too unless he came up with a breathtakingly spectacular apology. Nobody says crap about my dog and gets away with it. Thank you for standing up for Toasty and hitting the witch where it hurts. It\u2019s the least she deserves.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to know is just when did it become the MOH/bridesmaids job to plan the wedding? I had never heard of that until coming here to Reddit. Back in my day as MOH or bridesmaid, you tried on dresses, bought the one the bride wanted, maybe had a small little bachelorette party, walked down the aisle and helped her to the bathroom when she\u2019s wearing her big dress. That was it.", "Dear OP, \nIt\u2019s good that you finally put your foot down. Reading your post, it gave me a vibe that your would be sister in law is an incredibly toxic person. You\u2019re NTA!\nAlso, your Toast is probably running around in the Dog Heaven! Sending you hugs", "NTA - It was a very high possibility that they were going to use you to pay for the entire wedding. It is about time you stood up for yourself from this horrible human being. Your brother is in a world of hurt if he marries this (I can't even say what she is).  Condolences on the loss of your beloved Toast (Ella could not even give you condolences).", "NTA. She was trying to hustle you AND she's mean.", "NTA. Not even a little. First, a MOH duties do NOT include planning the whole wedding and they certainly do NOT put down all the deposits and pay for the wedding. If you ask me, it sounds 100% like they were going to stiff you for the wedding. I don\u2019t believe for a minute her parents were paying for it. She was using us and I can\u2019t believe your brother can\u2019t see the kind of person you are. And I\u2019ll tell you what, fucking with the memory of my dog, well those are fighting words. I guess she fucked around and found out.", "NTA. She used and abused you and you stood up for yourself. You can't expect someone you're cruel to to plan and pay for your wedding. Maybe this will be a wake up call for your brother.", "NTA Op! I\u2019m so very sorry about Toast, you were lucky to have each other \u2764\ufe0f", "She was going to take you for all that money, and was just using you. Your brother was allowing it. The comment about your dog was incredibly crappy. I'm sorry about your loss. NTA", "NTA. But do talk to your brother to make sure he knows everything that happened. \n\nCondolences on your loss.", "NTA. Anyone who crosses the line into disrespecting your sweet old dog deserves to be nuked. Great dog name too.", "Didn\u2019t ruin HIS big day\u2014just helped him to transition it from YOUR event to THEIR event.  He still has time to reach out to his future in-laws so they can bring out their checkbook and get everything back on track.\n\nOf course, finding a new MOH with short notice might be a toughie but considering that she didn\u2019t really seem all that close with you, I can\u2019t imagine her heart being broken all that bad.  Except now maybe she\u2019ll have to do some of the work herself.\n\nAnyone want to take bets on whether her parents would have come through with the reimbursements?", "NTA. She didn\u2019t respect you or your money. Honestly, good for you. She sounds awful, and I hope your brother dumps her.", " NTA. She was using you. She was never going to pay you back and then she takes a swipe at your dog dying. F her. You did the right thing.", "Nta. I hope you were able to get all of your money back. And I am pretty sure she was never going to pay you back the money and expect you to pay the wedding as a gift to them. I am happy you stood up for yourself. I hope you never have to see or talk to her again.", "This was truly an epic read. Normally I\u2019m not for the nuclear option, but damn if I didn\u2019t enjoy your revenge. NTA OP.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss OP.", "NTA She was cruel.\n\nBut you may have lost your brother with your response (it sucks that he ends up being punished too for her nastiness. I hope he sees this before it\u2019s too late). \nOnly time will tell.", "You didn't cancel the wedding. You extricated yourself from an abusive and exploitative situation. They're still free to marry, on their own thin dime. \n\nYour only possible slightly bad move was agreeing to be this witch's MOH. You were generous and hard-working, only to be rewarded with cruelty. As Maya Angelou said, \n\n>When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.", "Now, OP, since you probably aren\u2019t going to the wedding, that block of time is still freed up. Why don\u2019t you take a day or two and go someplace special. Someplace nice, just for you. You deserve it, not just to make up for the way the bride treated you, but because of the loss of your dog. NTA", "Also deposits for wedding stuff aren\u2019t usually refundable so close to the date. I also don\u2019t believe this one.", "Yeah but it\u2019s also the brothers wedding so I cant imagine it would be an easy \u201cNo\u201d \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I have NEVER been a dog person but would NEVER make a statement like that\u2014NEVER.  That\u2019s just plain mean.  Many dog owners consider their pooches to be like one of their children\u2014an integral part of their family.", "Nah, brother is too twitterpated to tell the Evil Queen from Snow White.", "I don't disagree with her actions because the bride is way over the top, but her brother probably won't ever forgive her. They should have had an affordable wedding instead of relying on OP.", "They aren't deposits either, it's just breaking down the price into different payments. When we put our first \"deposit\" down for the wedding venue, the planner joked that we were basically signing the marriage contract now considering how pricey weddings are. That money is non-refundable. \n\nSo yeah, I'm skeptical as hell that this is real.", "Its pretty easy to say no to paying for someone else\u2019s wedding, even a sibling."]}
