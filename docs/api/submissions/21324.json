He recently got relocated to another state for work (temporary but we don\u2019t know exactly how long). I flew down there on Saturday to visit him for the week. \n\nWe were having an amazing time until Sunday night about midnight I got woken up by the sound of the TV getting knocked over. I sat up and looked around and I see him standing in the corner of the room facing the wall. Obviously super creepy to wake up to and then I realize what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s standing by the desk and peeing in my suitcase. I start yelling at him but he\u2019s totally incoherent and has no idea what\u2019s going on. \n\nAfter I turn the lights on and he sorta snaps out of it I\u2019m asking him why on earth he did that and he says he has no idea. I go out to the kitchen and low and behold he\u2019s drank almost the entire bottle of vodka we bought at the store that day. Even after I found the bottle he denied being drunk. \n\nFor context, I do not drink. My last serious boyfriend was an alcoholic and living with him was extremely difficult for me. My current boyfriend knows this and up until now has always been very respectful and kept his drinking to a reasonable level. \n\nHe insisted on taking the clothes down to the laundry building right then, and I fell back asleep waiting for him. When I woke up in the morning he was asleep face down on the couch. I woke him up and told him I was really upset by what happened last night and wanted to talk about it. He dismissed me, said he was busy relaxing and didn\u2019t want to be bothered. Several more times I asked him to please sit up and talk to me about this and he refused, wouldn\u2019t even lift his head to make eye contact. Finally I started packing my stuff in a backpack (my suitcase is ruined) and I told him his choices were, continue laying on the couch, or get up and talk to me otherwise I was going home. He ignored me. As I was putting my shoes on he finally sat up and asked if I was for real, I said yes and that I didn\u2019t want to do this again. \n\nHe didn\u2019t try to stop me, so I took my stuff and walked to a Starbucks a couple blocks away. I called my best friend and my mom, then took an Uber to the airport and got on the next flight home. After I was gone for about 20 minutes he texted me and asked what was going on and I said I was going home, his response was \u201calright then\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s saying he was too drunk and doesn\u2019t remember anything from the morning and it was unfair of me to leave before he sobered up. I think what I did was justified because he knew that heavy drinking was not something I was comfortable with, and not only did he sneak and do it behind me back, he continued to try and lie about it after he got caught.", "created_utc": 1688489922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qkmrq/aita_for_walking_out_on_my_boyfriend_after_he/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's an adult, I'm confident he's been drunk before, so he knows the risks, and the way it can change your actions and thoughts\n On top of that, he knew about your ex and his issues.

I thought it was kind of funny until I moved in with him and found out the reason.  I had changed jobs and moved 150 miles away from my family for this man and it turns out he was a raging alcoholic (and drug addict).  He had bottles stashed all over the place and I had no idea because I had only ever been with him for a day or two at a time.  It all culminated in him raging out, taking my house key and trying to kick down a door to the spare room where I was hiding.  I obviously moved out but he stalked me for a year.  He eventually lost his job and his license, was foreclosed on, got arrested twice for DV against his current partner, and was evicted from his rental house.

It lets you leave and end things with less fuss. And it\u2019s clear that this guy is a dud. I don\u2019t know many people who do drink who\u2019d be ok with a 30 year old downing a bottle of vodka to get blackout drunk and peeing on their property. By that age, those of us who don\u2019t have a problem with alcohol and are social and responsible consumers, simply don\u2019t do things like this.

Ignoring you is psychotic", "My bf is a recovering alcoholic and over the last 2 months he\u2019s had a lot of slips (depression). One night I came home from work early (12:30 am) because something wasn\u2019t sitting right with me. I found him on the floor, incoherent, practically unresponsive because he was just staring at me and wouldn\u2019t respond to anything. I called 911.  He was right next to the tv stand and his face was all jacked up. I thought he hit his head. Apparently, it was just rug burn. EMTs almost took him to the hospital because he was doing the same to them, not talking, not responding. Than one who is British apparently started talking and that knocked my bf out of it. He started talking. Knew the president, the day, his birthday. So they didn\u2019t take him. He also pissed himself while I was trying to get him to go to bed. He can\u2019t be reasoned with or talked to when he\u2019s drunk, I have to wait until he\u2019s sober. And I made it perfectly clear that I\u2019d be does it again, I\u2019m gone. With the cats. He\u2019s aware that if I leave, he can\u2019t make it on his own. Your bf sounds like mine. You\u2019re still young and don\u2019t live with him. Cut your losses and leave.

Unless you are saying the current one frequently drinks heavily, it\u2019s kind of unfair to label him as an alcoholic just because he\u2019s very drunk for once. Think about it this way. Imagine if you never ever had an alcoholic ex before. I bet you are not going to have such an over-reaction over the current one drinking (assuming that\u2019s the first time you catch him drinking).

Sounds like you have a great support network.", "Fair enough, though the reason I ask is that going from either no drinking to moderate drinking to downing an entire bottle of vodka also seems very out of character from what you've said.

Our compromise was that he wouldn\u2019t drink heavily when we were together because I didn\u2019t like to be around it. I was fine with him drinking as long as he was able to control it in my presence but that\u2019s obviously not the case anymore", "If you don\u2019t mind my saying, for future, you should look for someone whose heaviest level of drinking is still within your comfort zone. When someone is just avoiding doing it in front of you but likes doing that generally, it\u2019s only a matter of time before problems crop up. Either they lose control like this guy or they resent you for limiting their default level of consumption. Rather than try to get someone to hold back on what they really want, much safer/simpler to date someone who wants what you want in the first place.", "Okay, that's a super important clarification. I definitely think you are NTA and he sounds like he has a closet drinking issue."]}
