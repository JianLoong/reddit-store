Your overall perception of her and her issues are dismissive.", "If you had said \"Jenny, I love you, but I really don't have the mental capacity to listen to you complain about food right now.\" You'd be fine. Calling it \"rich people shit\" is what makes Y-TA. But ESH, because she was being totally tone deaf.", "NAH.   OP I think you have a chip on your shoulder about \u201crich people\u201d all the while your friend is a bit tone deaf.  \n\nPeoples problems don\u2019t always line up to what we think a problem is (The coffee was tone deaf). But you are tone deaf as well.  Parents not being present for birthdays didn\u2019t seem like a big deal to you at the time.  You were tone deaf to her.  \n\nI have no advice beyond realize the grass isn\u2019t always greener.  I also think your relationship has been building towards this conversation.", "I don't think she was right to respond to you by complaining about coffee.\n\nBUT...it also seems like you don't really take her problems all that seriously in general. Like, her parents not being there for her birthday is a pretty sad thing. I do get that from where you're sitting, it doesn't look all that bad...I guess it's just a matter of perspective.", "YTA. OP rich people can also have problems, the fact that Jenny had a tough childhood shows that, and although you wished to have one just like hers if you\u2019d lived it you may have also hated it. It seems like you are friends with Jenny solely because she befriended you when you had no one and you\u2019re returning the favour by remaining as her friend. \n\nHOWEVER, you\u2019re also NTA, because you\u2019re going through something tough and yes Jenny seems to have over written it with her seemingly tedious everyday problem. But OP you also didn\u2019t have to be that rude towards her as she did initially listen to, how fast did she move from the topic? Did you guys talk about it for a bit and then move or not just straight move on to Jenny\u2019s problems?", "YTA because you're still carrying around her \"rich people problems\" from high school. Jeez, just cut her off already and you won't have to endure her any more.", "Soft YTA. I\u2019m sorry you are going through a rough time. I have found that people enduring a trauma don\u2019t know how to deal with it themselves any more than their close ones know how to deal with supporting them. \n\nWhat she was talking about is not \u201crich people shit\u201d and saying \u201cI love you BUT\u201d makes it clear, your love is conditional. It really sounds like she didn\u2019t know how to help you with your grief and was trying to distract you a bit with mundane stuff. You would have done better to tell her what you need rather than snap some vague clich\u00e9 about what you don\u2019t. She can\u2019t read your mind and if she has never had a loved one get very sick or die, she probably has no clue how to help you. In your upset, you may not have known yourself. \n\nWhat did you want right then? Perhaps something along the lines of \u201cI love you AND I appreciate you trying to distract me or make me feel more normal, but what would really help right now is if you could listen to me talk about my pet/grandma for a bit.\u201d", "Was she tone deaf to what was going on in your life at that moment? 100%, and that makes her an AH.\n\nBUT... I'm not rich, does that mean I can't complain when a place no longer serves what I love? Gelato isn't rich people food... As for the spring break trip, you're looking at it wrong. You see it as \"Oh no, she's getting mommy and daddy's credit card to buy whatever she wants.\" You know how I see it? She was let down again by her parents.That constantly make promises and then go back on it because they don't want to deal with their daughter. She didn't want their credit card, she wanted the road trip that was promised to her. Being let down by your parents and them breaking promises isn't a rich people problem. I think the only one hung up on the rich people's stuff, is you. I'm not quite sure why what she makes is pertinent to this story.\n\nYTA for your comment and being hung up on money and \"rich people shit.\"\n \nBut I'm sorry to hear about your rat and Grandma", "Esh. She sounded really crazy complaining about mundane stuff like that unless she was trying to make it funny? You were over the top, these complaints your friend made arent \"rich people shit\", theyre just boring crap.\n\nAs someone who grew up in a richer household that was also neglectful: yeah some habits die hard but in the end we don't want to be associated with our shitty parents. If your friend is normally a good friend I don't think you should be torching the relationship over this", "NAH, I think her comment was tone deaf given your understandable upset over your pet\u2019s death and that your grandmother\u2019s cancer reoccurrence. I also think you overreacted about her tone deaf comments. I don\u2019t think that makes either of you an asshole. I\u2019d reach out to her, apologize and share why you were hurt.", "Soft YTA. You are dismissive of Jenny's emotional pain. If your parents never wanted to spend any time with you, money can't make that better. It sounds like she was emotionally neglected in her childhood.\n\nIt's hard to know if Jenny was the asshole in your recent conversation without more context. It could've been tone deaf on her part. But maybe she thought it was ok to just talk about normal stuff like friends do. And sometimes that is welcome as a distraction when someone is mourning. Her complaining wasn't \"rich people stuff.\" Clearly you have a hard time with Jenny's financial position and you're going to hold it over her head forever.", "You know, parents are the main instructors for kids when it comes to learning how to interact relationally to others. Hers were absent, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me that she\u2019s awkward when it comes to comforting a friend - she probably never learned how. Did she handle this situation well? No. But it sounds like she was trying to distract you or even be funny and just fell flat. She probably has no idea how to be there for you because no one modeled it by being there for her.\n\nI have to say, you sound very dismissive of the emotional neglect she suffered at her parents\u2019 hands - and that\u2019s common with those of us who had present parents and don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s like to live without the support system you take for granted. Life experience will open your eyes to it, though, and you\u2019ll soon see you were the richer one all along.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear about your Grama and pet. Wishing you well as you navigate this tough time.\n\nESH", "This would depend. It\u2019s like NTA because you are going through something bad, but YTA because you shouldn\u2019t take out that anger/sadness on your friend. Though I can understand how it can be annoying.", "YTA-you are very dismissive of her pain as well. You two seem to just have that kind of relationship.", ">She called me a jerk and said that friends always listen to each others' problems.\n\nIdeally, this is true. But her complaints on this occasion were tone deaf, at the very least. It doesn't sound like _she_ actually listened. NTA", "YTA. Your friends parents neglected her and made her feel like nothing, and you scoff at her problems because she has a credit card?? \n\nThe letter or the day is B for BITTER. Makes sense why you wouldn\u2019t have many friends, you\u2019re a shitty friend.", "ESH well I think it was insensitive of her to immediately change the subject and complain herself, I think you were off base with it being a \u201crich people\u201d thing- she was just complaining about mundane, typical work annoyances. Which again, not appropriate when you told her your news, but not really a rich thing.", "NTA, and I'm sorry for your loss. Rest in Peace, Emile, I hope your beloved pet is eating brie in whatever rodent afterlife there might be. (SQUEAK, if you're a Pratchett fan.) I wish you well, OP. It's understandable that you snapped at her. You're dealing with grief and she was very dismissive.", "NTA. If Jenny was really your friend she would have clued in and dropped her garbage and asked you to share.  Sorry you have to tolerate her selfishness.", "Soft YTA. You say that you said two sentences about Emile and your grandmother and she responded and that was that. If you didn\u2019t elaborate further, maybe she took that as a sign that you didn\u2019t want to discuss it any more? She also may have misinterpreted the conversational cues and thought you wanted a momentary distraction from your problems, so she shifted the talk to lighter issues.", "NTA.

You could have said you don't have the energy at the moment for it or something.\n\nBut also... the stuff you mention, I think you're really lacking some sympathy for her. Let's look at her birthday from another angle. Here she thought her parents were gonna do something for her, something more personal, giving her their time and showing they cared... and instead they threw what she already has anyway at her, more money. For those of us who grew up without feeling like a second thought to our parents, who never had to question how much they cared, money is gonna look way better. But for someone whose parents never show they do, I can imagine them spending their time being a lot more valuable. The picture you've painted is they kind of abandon her emotionally and that was another instance of them failing her like that. That isn't just a rich person problem.", "ESH I\u2019d say for how you responded to her tone death behavior.

Ok, so maybe the phrase \u201crich people shit\u201d is not the best, but I think that at that moment, you probably could not verbalize how diminishing and dismissive your friend was being, complaining about stupid and superficial stuff right after you shared something painful.

I hope you forgive me and can still support me because I\u2019m having a hard time right now with everything going on\u201d. \n\nI understand the idea that rich people can\u2019t have real problems, but having two parents that don\u2019t love you and think money is a replacement for being present and having an actual family IS a real problem, and no, it\u2019s not really a \u201crich people\u201d problem either.

I used to be jealous of a kid that sat next to me in one of my college classes- rich parents, drove a BMW etc. Then he was in the hospital for a week and no one came - found out about that after he got back to class. Shortly after, I took a call from my dad right before class started (typical \u201cdid you change your car oil??

Also sending good vibes to Grandma. I hope she battles her diagnosis  successfully.", "NAH only because I feel bad calling you an AH.

I have trauma dumped to peers and peers have trauma dumped to me.  Take turns.\n\nI get this.  I have situations in my life that are just more difficult than my peers.\n\nLike if people were coffee, talking, and comparing difficulties, I'm going to win.  It's sucks.  Makes you feel like a Debbie Downer.\n\nComparison is the theft of joy. I'll repeat this later. And it's easier sometimes to keep your head down and your working towards your problems.\n\nBut to hear someone complain about non-issues, It can lead to snapping.  \n\nI snooze some peers Facebook pages.  Because comparison is theft of joy.\n\nI absolutely wish everyone I know to do best at life and win.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's not really freaking hard.

Yes, she is old enough to know better, but you basically also taught her 10 years ago, that while you all can share tough moments, you are also expected to gloss over them. \nNeither of you know how to deal with your friend\u2019s pain and are too caught up in your own issues to actually be there for each other. \nYou owe each other an apology.", "Why are you friends with her if you don't like her? YTA. Not because you wanted more sympathy this time around, but for your general perception of her for all these years. You have no empathy, but you expect some from her. \n\nShe never should have sat next to you all those years ago. If she didn't, she wouldn't have had to go through life with a fake friend who was always secretly jealous of her.", "Nta", "ESH. \n\nSomeone complaining constantly is obnoxious, seems like she's taking it overboard with venting, and she's picked a very inappropriate time to complain about something. It feels a bit like she isn't concerned about your pain.\n\nOn the other hand, you clearly resent her for having a different childhood. Grass is greener on the other side OP. Money doesn't make your life better, it makes it easier. Lots of people have crappy childhoods even of they have money. And lot of people have great childhoods even if money is tight. \n\nShe sucks for not giving your heartache more grace and empathy. In this issue, you are very clearly in the right. Shes not being a good friend. But overall your friendship also has problms that you are causing. You have the mindset that she's not allowed to complain because you're worse off. That attitude is going to eat away at your friendship if you don't address it.", "If all she really said was \u201cthat freaking sucks\u201d then immediately bitched about her coffee then NTA. But if she actually genuinely talked to you about it for a few then YTA. The way you wrote this though comes off as she basically said \u201cdamn that\u2019s crazy\u201d then moved on.", "YTA, you can communicate better then that but you chose to be mean.", "I don't know why everyone's telling you to apologize.  She didn't care enough about your rat or your grandma, and plunged right in to her petty problems .  NTA, but maybe time to let her go.    \n\n\nI'm very sorry about the loss of Emile, and I hope your Grandma is doing well.", "Having parents that don't love you is a problem for people of all income levels, but having parents that don't love you *and think money is a replacement for being present and having an actual family* is definitely only a rich people problem. Or at least an upper middle class and above problem. Poor people who aren't around for their kids because they're working are doing it to provide basic necessities and aren't having the kids their credit card to make up for not being around.", "When every problem in your life can be traced back to you not having enough money, of course you see having plenty of money as something that fixes everything, because it would literally *solve all of your problems.*  \n\nI\u2019m not saying rich people can\u2019t have problems, but if everything wrong in your life could be fixed with money, wouldn\u2019t you also struggle to understand how in the world you could have money and still have problems?"]}
