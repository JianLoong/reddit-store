We swapped cars (they're both early 2000s models). My car chews petrol ($120 to fill) & i'm a broke student so I was happy to swap as her car costs less. She ended up having my car for 3 months. she kept going for trips w her caravan, I didn't mind.\nWhen we swapped cars however, my car sounded fucked. My dad had a look at it & said the muffler was broken but that it wouldn't ruin my car, just embarrassingly loud.\n\nI asked her to pay to repair it, she refused, insisted that it didn't sound any different and that it was always like that. my dad serviced it the day before i gave it to her and disagreed. we didn't speak for a month because I couldn't afford to fix it & she damaged it. I coped with it, decided i'd sell my car cheap soon, as i can't afford repairs & need an ergonomic car. We patched things up & I moved on because she wasn't paying up.\n\nFast forward to now, 2 weeks ago she mentioned she had a 2 week trip planned for QLD which is over 1000km each way & that she needed my car again, offered to pay me $100 and swap cars as I was hesitant. \nA week ago I mention the brakes are wearing and would probably need to be replaced before that kind of trip. She said for peace of mind she would pay for a service & we would see what's wrong & go from there as it would be a lot cheaper than hiring a car.\nToday she took my car in and the mechanic said it would be $700 to replace break pads and new tyres to be suitable for a 2000km + trip towing a caravan but that it also needed additional work & the car isn't worth it. My mum called me to tell me this & i said i was planning on selling my car for cheap or parts & im not able to afford this, she said she leaves in 4 days and this is half the price of a rental car and she would pay it if i pay half and i can pay her $350 in instalments because she needs it.\nTonight she called me & asked how much I think a new muffler would be as it's loud & i said around $400 but if she wanted to get it fixed i would pay half because she's already paying half for the service.\n\nThis is when she told me she had never said she would pay half and she expects me to pay her the full $700 because it's my car & it needed to be done. she is insisting I pay even though her half of the service today is equal to replacing the muffler she already broke a few months ago. I looked into it and a hire car is around $1.4k for her trip which she planned assuming she could use my car. I feel it's fair for her to pay half given she said she would.\nshe says i'm in the wrong & she never agreed because it's my car why would she pay for it & she's doing me a favour allowing me to pay her back over time as I couldn't have afforded it.\nso AITA?", "created_utc": 1680090234, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125lk1k/aita_making_my_mum_pay_to_fix_my_car/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now it's more repairs, they all need done now so your mom can use your car and you have to pay for all of it.\n\nI would go with if you would like to pay for these repairs you can borrow it, otherwise I'll cut my losses and sell it now as is.\n\nI can't understand why her vacations are so much more important any than your transportation or why she expects you to pay.  She needs to buy a car that can tow her thing.", "Assuming what you said covers everything definitely NTA. Your mum sounds like one though.", "NTA - you can't afford the foxes that make her able to borrow it. If she wants to borrow it she can pay for the fixes. You aren't required to fix your car so she can use it.

Mom wants to use it, she should pay to have everything fixed.

Just tell her if she doesn\u2019t want to pay, she can find another vehicle", "NTA. Stop loaning your car. If nothing else take the towbar off. If she can afford a caravan.

Your mom ruined your car with her heavy caravan - definitely wearing on your brakes - and doesn't want to pay for things that needed repair under her stewardship.

Or sell the car to someone else and she can pay the $1.4 thousand to rent it.", "NTA.  This whole thing is a cluster fuck.  The best thing for you to do is to tell her she can\u2019t borrow the car and sell it.  Then I\u2019d never let her borrow any of your cars again.  The back and forth is just irritating both of you.

Follow your first mind and don't put any more money in your car.", "ESH\n\nJust stop lending your car to your mom. \n\nESH bc one should think you already learnt its not a good idea to lend your car to your mom, but obviously you haven't learnt anything so its kind of your own fault to be in this messy situation again.", "I wanna clear up some things: \n\nShe paid the mechanic to do the bare minimum to make sure it would be fine to tow and travel that far, she paid the $700 upfront. I have not paid any money, the agreement was that I would pay her my half over the next few pays. I dont earn a lot and wasnt in a finanical situation to pay this amount upfront to fix my car hence why I wanted to sell it. There's a few things wrong but most are fixable just not worth it for ME given the car costs too much to fill up, it would be a good car and I would try repair and keep it until it died but I dont need a V6 or tow bar, most peoples cars are $60-80 a tank the difference in fuel consumption is the main reason for me wanting to sell it. The original incident when she gave it back was 3 months ago so we have been on good terms for the last 2 months. This is obviously showing a pattern though.   \nShe has been looking in recent weeks for a new car but obviously thought I would be a back up.", "I NTA FO  -  how did she break the muffler?  Unless she hit something, and that would be obvious, it might not be fair to say she broke it. \n\n\nWouldn\u2019t the fairest thing be to do an honest accounting of the wear and tear based on mileage and expected part life?  Also take into consideration how much of the repair cost you will be able to recoup when you sell the car in working order, rather than for parts.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You weren't planning to put money out for all these repairs as you were selling it soon.", "I recently talked about buying her car off her and she would've swapped except for the fact my car eats petrol but at this point i'm considering just not swapping back the cars. She can sell it and buy a better one.", "the mechanic said it needs a new rotor soon and has an oil leak and possibly a fan belt issue that he could temporarily patch up but would need fixing soon so i think a new car is def the smartest choice", "it was already done today! i agreed because i understood that we were going halves and it was equally beneficial. She's only saying now the car is fixed and her trip has the green light that she didn't agree to that.", "Pretty much covers everything in the word count. She says I misunderstood her and i'm being entitled because why would she pay for my car to be fixed but like i'm letting her put kms on it etc. i'm paying insurance and road side assistance still for this trip.

Don\u2019t expect to borrow a broken car and have it fixed JUST so you can borrow it. \nNTA", "I guess that's fair. I was hesitant but she seemed so willing to help me repair my car that I thought she was making up for last time so I would trust her with it until she found a car to buy that would tow it.", "I assume she hit something. Dad said it was bent out of shape and didn't look like that before she had it. \nI was thinking that halving the cost was fair but at this point her behaviour, gaslighting and manipulation is making me feel like I shouldn't pay any of it. I never would've agreed to the repairs knowing I was expected to pay it all back. I can't really sell the car until the Muffler is repaired as a whole unless i sell it for cheap. I could get more money if I also fixed that but I shouldn't have to. \nWhen the muffler incident happened she changed her story saying it happened in the first few days of having my car, then said maybe she did something but she didn't realise and then that it was always like that. She also definitely made it seem like we were fixing the car together and sharing the cost to help us both out.. \nas for parts/as is (prior to repairs) i probably could've gotten 1.5-2k. \nFull repairs (2k worth of repairs total approx) around $5K.. not really worth it and i don't have the money. The belt makes a weird sound sometimes so would have to be fixed. could be cheap or need complete replacing, the 2k quote isn't including if the belt needs to be replaced so i'm not sure i think i'm gonna just sell it as is", "Sounds like she probably shouldn\u2019t be using it for towing on a 2000km round trip anyway.
