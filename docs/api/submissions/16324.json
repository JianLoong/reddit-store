If he cant calmly talk about later when hes less angry, I would be concerned. If hes this angry about something so small what is he gonna do when theres a real problem?", "I\u2019ve never been so genuinely worried about a Reddit user before, please leave this is so not normal :( \n\nIf you wanna date an older man that\u2019s fine but not one who throws temper tantrums over HAIR\n\nYou\u2019re gonna end up the victim of something and I\u2019m gonna learn about it on one of those shitty crime shows. You deserve so much better than a cheesy reenactment \ud83d\ude25", "Nothing about his response, ie \u201cShaking with anger\u201d is proportional to what actually happened, especially since it\u2019s not something you did TO him. For him to be that irate over YOUR hair is highly problematic and extraordinarily controlling. Your body your choice- I had a BF who wanted me to wear my hair straight way more often despite the fact that I was growing my natural curls out. The only way to get it straight is with a flat iron set to 450 degrees. That\u2019s a setting to broil steaks on, not what you should use for your hair. Guess who didnt get to see a lot of straight hair? This is not healthy for you.", "Honey, listen to me: men his age don't date women your age because they want an equal partner.  They want you because you don't come with \"baggage\" like women their age supposedly do, women their age don't generally put up with this kind of bullshit, and younger women like yourself are generally easier to manipulate.  This behaviour of his will not improve, at best he'll love-bomb you to convince you he's \"learned\" and then he'll just start this shit up again.\n\nLeave him.  Live up your 20s.  Enjoy life.  Don't hitch your wagon to this.", "NTA A boyfriend with such unregulated anger issues about your bodily autonomy is not a safe boyfriend. Coercive control combined with the huge age difference is a recipe for disaster, he has shown you exactly what he is so stay at your own peril.", "Because it IS unnecessary. He thinks his opinion over your hair matters more than your opinion of your hair. \n\nAs if a styling mistake is such a grievous offence that he has a right to be angry about. \n\nLiterally it's hair. It's not you, it's basically an accessory and he's gotten himself into a rage because of it? \n\nA shaking rage ... Because what you did with your hair deviated from his expectation. \n\nPlease be on the lookout for other signs of controlling behavior.", "It\u2019s abusive, as well as unnecessary.", "It is unnecessary. And unhealthy. Please don\u2019t stay in this relationship. He\u2019s over twice your age. Based on this interaction and the age gap, he\u2019s with you because he wants someone to control.\n\nPlease leave this guy. He\u2019s not worth it.", "Because it is unnecessary. If he can\u2019t respect your bodily autonomy, you should take that as a sign that he isn\u2019t going to respect your right to make decisions elsewhere.", "Idk maybe try dating someone your own age? I'm older than you. My father is younger than your boyfriend. Get a clue.", "Hugh Laurie", "\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude02 dyslexic...", "Yikes. It must be like, being too close to the situations you see often, make you blind to it happening to yourself or something.", "it means she's lying", "No, the last time she f*cked up her hair they had just started dating.", "Sorry. I\u2019m a little frazzled right now. The first time I cut my hair this short was when we\u2019d first started dating.", "I mean, in her favor, at least she ended the marriages as soon as they turned abusive. Way too many people stay in them.", "Bros 50 what are you doing", "And has he been like that ever since or has he been wonderful and this was this just an isolated incident? I hope it's the latter."]}
