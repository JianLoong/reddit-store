She embarrassed herself.", "NTA\n\nTotally right to set boundaries. \n\nSounds like you did have other contributing factors, but nothing you ultimately did was wrong.", "Oh my god NTA. You\u2019re an adult and you don\u2019t deserve your own mom making awful comments about you. Saying you\u2019re a prostitute because your dress is riding up??? That\u2019s so disrespectful and uncalled for. I hope you can figure out how to set some boundaries with her because you shouldn\u2019t have to get a verbal beating down every time you see her.", "NTA - Way to go for calling her out in the moment! She tried to publicly humiliate you and you kept your dignity while setting your boundary. I am so proud of you.", "definitely NTA. She did sth she probably knew was embarrassing for you but still did it so you took the Uno reverse card and showed her", "NTA. Mom can keep her hands and criticisms to herself.", "NTA - she repeatedly shames you to the point you had to retaliate and it embarrassed her. And she expects and apology or your disowned?\n\nOP keep an eye on your bf who sided with your mom's behaviour.", "NTA", "NTA. Your mother is treating you like a child, not an adult, by grabbing and adjusting your clothes. That is not okay. And it\u2019s also not okay for her to body shame you regardless of whether you were a child or an adult. This sounds like a toxic family dynamic and I\u2019m glad you are getting some space away from them.", "NTA, and your boyfriend sucks too. i\u2019m glad you\u2019re working on your self esteem. please let this to be a moment to evaluate who deserves to be in your life and supports you doing \u2018you\u2019 best.", "NTA", "NTA. You may have been intentionally mean, but mom brought it upon herself here. Honestly this reaction was pretty tame given how much she seems to have done to elicit it.", "NTA - my petty ass would have KEPT yelling until security actually came hahahahaha", "NTA - just know that you are allowed to stay away from toxic people, even if they are family!

Your mum was literally being so rude about the way you looked and for you to get angry is completely the right way to feel. Calling you a prostitute? That is so nasty, I would say talk to her and tell her that what she said to you was extremely disrespectful and immature but if she's always been bullying you like that I would say don't talk to her anymore. That is so rude I can't imagine how rude someone has to be to call their own child a prostitute.", "OP, as you age into adulthood and gain independence. Expect this to get worse.", "He doesn't agree with the whole 'exposed skin = whore' thing, he just said there were better ways of dealing with it and I was petty and immature instead of the bigger person. I don't know if he's wrong.", "The \u201cbigger person\u201d or \u201calways take the high road\u201d argument is only useful when the two sides are both acting in good faith. Your mom is not acting as a concerned, loving mom; she\u2019s acting in a selfish way that violates your wishes and personal space. I have spent years being the \u201cbigger person\u201d and all it gets you is walked on. The only thing I can say for it is that it can sometimes keep you from feeling regret for saying something mean, but even then - you didn\u2019t just approach your mom and say something awful to her just to hurt her. Your actions were in response to her repeated violation of you. So if your words hurt her - that\u2019s on her, not you.", "Quite often, being \"the bigger person\" is an excuse that spineless cowards use because they don't have the courage or integrity to establish and uphold boundaries. \n\nDo you know when people stop harassing or mistreating you? WHEN YOU MAKE THEM STOP. Just like you did by embarrassing your mother so she'd stop with her completely unacceptable, reprehensible behaviour.\n\nThe fact that your boyfriend is taking your mother's side on this is worrisome as well. Does he respect your boundaries? Or does he try to overstep them too? \n\nYou're NTA. At all. I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself: nobody gets a free pass to mistreat or disrespect you at all, and that includes your mother.", "He is wrong, you can't be the \"bigger person\" when you are being bullied. That just doesn't exist, I know people want to think it does, but it doesn't. Bullies don't magically learn to not bully you because you \"take the high road\", they learn when they face consequences for their actions. \n\nYou did nothing wrong OP, I know it's overwhelming now but you really need to think long and hard if you even want contact with your family, who actively does harm to your mental wellbeing. Blood doesn't make people family, respect does. \n\nNTA, don't let your BF make you second guess yourself.", "NTA, mum doesn\u2019t like her boundaries been broached, but will do it to you. What a Nasty lady your mother is.", "Never give an ultimatum that you\u2019re not prepared to back up. NTA, and it seems like this is as clean of a break as you could ask for.", "NTA . And if I were you I\u2019d be looking for a new boyfriend.", "She didn't say she close to her mom, just that her mom isn't as bad as the rest.", "Another way to respond is act like she has dementia and in a louder and slower than normal explain to her that it isn't polite to touch others without their permission and that we have talked about this before and you know she forgets.\n\nNTA", ">and I was petty and immature instead of the bigger person\n\nI'm sorry, your boyfriend of FOUR YEARS said this? Does he not realise how emotionally abusive your mother is? My mom used to be very similar to yours and I developed an ED over it.", "[deleted]", "I think you made the correct decision, except possibly in choosing your boyfriend.", "NTA and that was hilarious.", "NTA - cut your losses and leave your family. Your mum sounds horrible, also sex workers dress awesomely - she\u2019s completely in the wrong and honestly what you did is hilarious. Leave them and find people that celebrate you because you\u2019re amazing.", "You may have intended your actions to be mean, probably so even.  But, you were responding to mean actions.  NTA.", "Closest doesn't mean close.  It means \"less estranged\" in this case.", "NTA and you\u2019re funny", "NTA. You took too long to take that bus."]}
