My husband isn\u2019t necessarily unhealthy but he is overweight, and we have had discussions of trying for a baby. I love my husband  but he\u2019s pushing 250. He eats horribly. He has issues bringing groceries in. I can\u2019t do this alone and I need a healthy husband. I have been trying to take better care of myself and cook better meals for him or go to the gym whenever I can and have been encouraging my husband to do better but he has yet too.\n\nI finally told him, to either begin working out or we will not be having a baby. I told him if I\u2019m having a baby I need him to keep up with me, and that I will not do this alone. He got very upset and said that was so unfair to with hold from him and that he\u2019d be a great dad despite his weight. I tried to explain I witness it all the time, and how he\u2019d feel much better and he needs to feel energized with a baby and healthy, but he told me I was just being insulting, and rude. He accused me of being inconsiderate of his feelings because I know how badly he wants a baby.\n\nI want a baby as well, but I need a healthy husband and a healthy support team.

No.  Did you handle this really badly?  Absolutely and YTA for that.  It takes so little to be kind.", "I have mixed feelings about this, if he indeed has a real issue even taking in the groceries, then yep it sounds dangerous (regardless of the baby's situation) and I understand you don't feel comfortable bringing such a big task into the mix. But I still feel like there must be a better way of communicating this concern of yours than the way you chose.\n\nAnyways his body - his choice ultimately. Your body - your choice as well. You are not obligated to make him a child if you don't feel up for it yourself at the moment for whatever reason.\n\nreluctant NAH", "YTA. If the tables were turned and he told you he\u2019d never have a baby with you at your present weight you\u2019d be livid, and rightly so. \n\nIf you\u2019re willing to give an ultimatum on something as important as having a family\u2014 meaning that you have full awareness that he could call your bluff and not change\u2014 think of the message that sends. It shows how weak your commitment to being a parent might be. Instead of you being worried you\u2019ll be doing it alone because of his health, maybe he should be worried he\u2019ll be doing it alone because of disinterest. I could never use something that important to me as a bargaining chip or a tool for coercion. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, it sounds like you\u2019re prioritizing how his health affects you over how it affects him. \n\nThere are ways to help your spouse achieve good things, but this is all kinds of not it.", "YTA. Shaming doesn't ever result in weight loss. If you feel the need to cajole him into healthier habits he's never going to stick to them long term and then you're going to be stuck in the same boat you're in now, but with a kid.\n\nAlso, plenty of people can be thin and eat horribly and be so out of shape they can't keep up with their kids. Your husband's weight isn't the issue, it's his lack of fitness and inability to balance his diet. What are you going to do if he does miraculously do what almost nobody can successfully do (you're a doctor and you don't know the statistics, lol?) and keep a considerable amount of weight off long-term and yet becomes disabled some other way? Leave him? Also, try keeping up with a kid with a big caloric deficit. It's not going to happen. You're a doctor and you don't know this?\n\nYou agreed to marry him as he is. A spouse isn't a project, they're a person. If you don't want to have a baby with him and he wants to have kids, leave. You're wasting his time and yours. This coercion isn't going to get you what you want and it's just cruel to your husband and any child that is brought into a household where one parent associates his child with his wife's manipulation. Go find a skinnier man and he can find a wife that is on the same page.", "I'm going to assume that you knew:\n\n* He was overweight\n* He wanted a baby\n* He was unreceptive to your talk about health and weight (not a perfect correlation but interrelated)\n\n*Knowing all that,* why did you marry him?\n\nHere's my guess. You thought, \"I've been so successful at school, because I'm smart and a hard worker, so I'll be successful at this thing too! I just have to keep trying and never give up! I will memorize all the facts and be persistent.\"\n\n**I have terrible news for you, OP.

I'd tell him how much you love him and want him to be healthy so he can be there a long time for you and the baby. Tell him what you know about how weight affects health. If you let him know you're concerned because you want him around for a long time, he may be more likely to listen.", "NTA \nHe struggles with groceries \n\nYou\u2019ll be the one putting baby in and out of car seats, all the park trips will fall to you, kid will start to only want to do things with you because you keep up.", "YTA.

Incredibly rude and insensitive comments.", "NTA overweight people in the comments are going to disagree and say he's perfectly fine when he's already having issues carrying groceries inside the house", "Obesity is a hot topic in U.S. because so many are obese and just don\u2019t want to admit that it\u2019s bad.", "NTA. If he wants to have kids, he needs to be mentally and physically top-notch. You didn't mention any medical conditions that would prevent him from being healthier, so he has no excuse. \n\nYou can love him for who he is but still want him to want to be healthy for you and his future kids. He should want to be healthier for you and the kids. If he can't handle carrying groceries, that's really bad. He definitely won't be able to carry a baby in a carrier with a large bag full of baby products. He can't expect you to carry the load 24/7.", "NAH.  I think it's ok to discuss what you would need to feel comfortable having a child.  There aren't perfect ways to have the conversation, and it is his body. It is worth discussing taking basic steps to maintain your health before becoming a parent.\n\nMy friend loves her late husband, she always will.  He was an amazing father, husband, and friend.  And he couldn't get his diet under control and he died when their son was 2.  His death was directly related to his weight.", "Slightly overweight dad here with a 15 month old. NTA. One of my biggest regrets is not having gotten in shape before having the kiddo. Working on it now, but there were several times I was out of gas that I shouldn\u2019t have been, especially with the sleep deprivation. \n\nFor the Y-T-A votes, this man is asking his wife to put her body through hell. She\u2019s going to need help and getting in shape will make showing up as a parent earlier. Heck, if he cares about being a parent so bad, getting healthier can give you literally years more to spend with your children.", "NTA. I'm very fit. My husband is not. And I'm so tired of everyone blaming the spouse. I've gently told him many times, and it always falls on deaf ears.   \n\n\nIt is very hard to tell someone you love they aren't a good weight, because that turns into \"you don't find me attractive, hurt feelings, etc.\" Frankly it sucks. And I cook every single day, but I feel awful saying, \"don't eat a huge portion, eat less.\"   \n\n\nThis isn't your fault, the guy owns a mirror and a scale. You aren't his mother. Saying you don't want kids until he gets healthy is very fair.", "NTA. You aren't required to produce a child with someone. \n\nI was very adamant about not being the married version of a single parent when my husband started talking about having kids. \n\nYou wanting your husband to be in shape enough to take care of a child is similar to that. \n\nNow that I have a baby, I'm encouraging myself and my husband to eat healthier and exercise more so we have the best chance of being around for our baby for the long term. It's what is best for the children and who wouldn't want that?\nAlso, I learned this a little late, but get some term life insurance for both of you before you start collecting any health issues so you have that in place for any future children.", "YTA. Imagine if a man said this to his wife and came here for opinions?", "NTA, you could have been more diplomatic, but if he already has issues merely carrying groceries at 30 things will probably get really bad with a baby and even less time and energy for his health.\n\nExpecting your partner to better themself is normal in a relationship, as is not having a baby until you feel both of you are secure enough to.", "NTA. I think some of you  missed the line where she said he has a problem bringing in the groceries. Sure, there can be a fine line between insult and the truth, but the truth is that he can't even do basic tasks without having problems due to his weight. How else should she have put it? OP was honest and firm about her decision, and especially being a resident in the medical field, would require her husband to be in decent enough shape to take care of a baby when she isn't around. That's a completely reasonable request", "NAH \n\nIf it was the title lines, I would say that yes you were being very rude\n\nAfter reading the text though, I think it was a more respectful conversation than that\n\nHowever, I would keep in mind that this will be extremely difficult for your husband and it has to be something he himself is commited to. And for most people, if they didnt respond to the initial push, it will take them a long time to get there. Not that you are, but dont expect him to be perfect with it as well even if he realizes he should be healthier\n\nI am not sure if he has other preexisting conditions but as you know as you are in medicine, being consistently winded from taking in groceries is very worrying\n\nRespectful communication and reasonable expectations are necessary going forward though. You might want to apologize if he feels hurt because this is a relationship and feelings matter a lot. Point out in a respectful way (not accusatory) your concerns with what you have seen (specific examples)", "NAH. You married him knowing full well his lifestyle. That said, you\u2019re right to want him to be healthier, IMO. \n\nAlso while exercising is great, diet is the biggest part of healthy lifestyle. The saying goes \u201cyou can\u2019t out exercise a bad diet.\u201d I can attest this is 100% true. And good diet doesn\u2019t have to be all green beans and kale. Load up on delicious meats and fresh produce and just cut the refined crap.", "NTA. Keep talking to him. He needs to see that you don't want to \"provide him with the baby he wants so much,\" but that you \"need him to be an active, equal partner\" in all things baby-related.\n\nTake walks together while you're talking this out.\n\nEDIT: yes, it's his body to make decisions about, but it's OP's to then decide whether or not to bring a baby into the mix. I think the title skews the judgement a bit because it's a bit callous/off-handed to tell someone else to \"hop on the treadmill\" but the situation is more complex than that.", "YTA.\n\ni get your motivations and you seem mostly well intentioned but there was definitely a much better way to go about the conversation. making it an ultimatum was almost guaranteed to garner an adverse reaction. you love him so why not make it a conversation about his overall health and tell him your genuine concerns (without insulting him like it sounds like you did) and figure out next steps together. if this is something you both want, you'll find a way to make it work, regardless of his weight.", "NTA, that was a tough conversation to have. You addressed something that needs to be discussed BEFORE you become pregnant. Not only are you concerned for his health but you are thinking ahead about a future child. That's smart and healthy thing to do in a relationship. Sometimes you need to discuss facts and not tip toe around feelings.", "NTA. You certainly lack tact, but I appreciate your concern for the health of your child\u2019s other parent. Especially in a male, being overweight and SOB carrying groceries is worrisome. Would you plan a child with him if you anticipated that he\u2019d be diagnosed with cancer? \n\nWould it be ok for him to drive drunk with your child in the car? Lots of drivers drive under the influence without having an accident. Is it any different to think his cardiac risk factors might imperil your child\u2019s welfare? No. NTA.", "YTA: I just don't believe you.  He's 250 and you say he can hardly bring in grocceries?  Is he what, four feet tall?   Come the fuck on.  There's some factor you're leaving out here that makes that story sound /way/ less crazy.  \n\n\nAlso... why would marry someone who was an unfit parent? Why would you spend years with them?  There's really no excuse for your behavior or how you're treating him.  If you didn't want a fat husband, you shouldn't have married one.  \n\n\nRegardless of whatever lifestyle mistake he's making, you can't go into a relationship with that and then expect them to change it.  Most people will fail.", "I get that you want a healthy husband. But being mean and insulting isn't any reasonable means to actually help him.\n\nYTA for being so nasty, rude, hurtful and insulting about this.", "YTA\n\nYou're giving him an ultimatum. I'm all for pushing people to be healthy, but you're effectively using a future child as ransom to force your husband to workout. There has to be better ways, and if he refuses to change then he he refuses to change. You chose to marry this man.", "YTA This is your partner, not an invalid. This is written as of you only care about his weight now, so you don\u2019t\n become a single parent\u2026 implying you didn\u2019t really care about it in your 1.5 yr marriage. Extremely manipulative. I also feel sorry for your future child, what will you hold over their head? \n\nFat people can have families. Are there pros and cons to to it, of course. But that could also be said about literally anything. Pull up the thread of kids raised by false altruistic cold doctors- that may be enlightening for you. \n\nSheesh. Work on your bedside manner in your life.", "YTA.\n\nHis health & weight is up to him, not you. Withholding having children as a control move is messed up if the two of you agreed to have children. What if he told you he wanted you to make sure you looked a certain way before you got pregnant? Or make sure you drop all of the weight you gain during pregnancy in no more than 4 weeks after the birth or he won\u2019t do his part of the parenting or sleep with you? Continue doing it & see how long he sticks around. If a guy said this to his wife, she would be well within her rights to leave him. You\u2019ve been trying to change him for years\u2026 why did you marry him?", "YTA what a rude way to go about that conversation. I hope your bedside manner is better but I doubt it.", "I'm gonna get roasted but NTA you can love someone and want to be with them and still want them to better themselves. If you're willing to stay with him but not want to burden yourself with a child there's nothing wrong with that and if he really wants a child he can make the changes needed. As a adult who didn't have able bodied parents I still think today at 30 what it would've been like to have a parent that could play sports with me or teach me how to take care of myself. I didn't realize till highschool you could just run more to increase stamina because my parents never ran even once my entire life.", "NTA. This is the harsh reality that he needs to face. You 100% do need a healthy partner to help you with the baby. Otherwise you\u2019re just a single mom with 2 kids and you didn\u2019t sign up for that.", "NTA you\u2019re loving him better than an enabler would", "If his weight is affecting his health to the point that he can't carry some groceries into the house, then NTA. \n\nHaving a kid is a lot of work. It's tiring physically and emotionally. I'd be concerned he would eat more and gain more after having a kid. A lot of us do, as we start putting the kids ahead of ourselves. If this was purely aesthetic, I'd say Y T A... but it sounds like there's some actual health concerns here.\n\nIt also sounds like you've tried to help him by cooking healthier and inviting him to the gym, but he hasn't gotten on board. So how all these people think Y T A still is beyond me. He won't be a helpful partner if he is physically unable to carry your kid up a flight of stairs or play at the playground with them or even have the energy for extra housework.", "NTA\u2014 but some of these commenters are. Given by some of your answers in the comments it seems as though you\u2019ve brought up this issue before with him, but now that you guys are thinking of having a baby, you\u2019ve talked about it more. And this is not just something that you\u2019re concerned about as far as having a child, you\u2019re concerned for his health as well. Some of these other people are saying that if the tables were turned, and he was commenting on you losing weight in order to have a baby that you would be livid or if it were another couple that the woman would be livid. But if you care about someone you\u2019re going to call out the harmful things that they are doing to their bodies. That\u2019s just how it is. If you love someone, you\u2019re going to give them that push and be supportive, and it seems like you have been supportive. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve done anything wrong and you\u2019re exhibiting an appropriate amount of concern. Having a child is a serious matter, and if he\u2019s struggling carrying just to bring the groceries in, how is he going to handle carrying a baby and diaper bag at the same time?", "I'm going to say NAH but it depends a lot on how you said it to him.  Most people who are overweight are self conscious about it so you kind of have to be careful about what you say approaching the topic because they will be easily offended.  It's not necessarily fair, but you kind of have to dance around the topic without making it sound like you are attacking them personally or \"shaming\" them.\n\nBut overall your sentiment is good, and it's good to want people you care about to be healthy.\n\nIf you work in medicine you probably know already though that losing weight is more about diet than exercise (although both are important).", "YTA.\n\n>My husband isn\u2019t necessarily unhealthy but he is overweight\n\n>I love my husband but he\u2019s pushing 250.\n\nThese lines are directly contradicted by EVERYTHING you say after. Could you have an actual discussion with him and voice your concerns about his health and your worries about how that would impact you and him raising a child? Yes, you absolutely could have. But you didn\u2019t. You essentially said \u201cyou\u2019re fat, lose weight or no baby\u201d and that\u2019s messed up. And you plan to be a DOCTOR?! I predict many a patient losing their lives because you blamed their chronic illness on their weight. Have you considered asking him if he would like to go to the gym with you or go for walks or ANYTHING other than making him feel bad about himself?\n\nYou are not his doctor. You are not his dietitian. You are his WIFE. You don\u2019t get to humiliate him and leave the room pretending he\u2019s gotten help from you like your patients. You want him to work on his health? Stop being clinical and be a human being.", "NTA. Surprised at so many y t a here", "I work as a trauma counselor and disordered eating has its roots in trauma. That\u2019s likely why he reacted the way he did. It\u2019s a complex issue and until he addresses why he overeats and doesn\u2019t take care of himself he will likely struggle. I\u2019m voting YTA because you didn\u2019t approach it with empathy and you did marry an overweight man so\u2026. Now he has to change?", "YTA. for no other reason than using a child as a bargaining chip in almost a blackmail ultimatum way. Wanting him to be healthy and having an open honest discussion about his weight is one thing. Holding a baby over his head cuz he\u2019s \u201cpushing 250\u201d is pretty crappy.", "You will also gain weight, get injured, age. Does that mean your partner should shame you for every role and wrinkle and say it makes u a bad parent?", "YTA, and I hope he leaves. What you're doing is manipulative af.

So what if he manages to suddenly lose a ton of weight, and then gets a baby, and then like a ton of people world-wide gains weight again because of age, stress, etc? And what if he keeps his weight? You would have still \"locked\" him in a situation where his spouse pressured him to lose weight knowing that he desperately wants a baby, and used it against him. \n\n*Encourage* your partner to be healthier for his future child, don\u00b4t use his dreams of a family against him. That is just cruel.", "Soft YTA. You haven't been with him that awfully long so obviously he was already a larger man and I already had unhealthy habits when you met him. So you decided what? That you were going to marry him knowing this and accepting this and then magically change him afterwards? And if you couldn't force him to change everything he was and all of his habits and everything you knew about him, you would then give him an ultimatum and take away something that he wanted? I understand you want him to be healthy and to be able to be fit for the baby.

As a child I only played catch or something with my dad maybe 3 times because just walking would make him Huff an puff. And it\u2019s so painful to see your parents or Parent like that. And when my little brothers shot out they couldn\u2019t keep up with the baby the baby was putting them to sleep every day so I had too help a lot with them too. When they got older they just gave them an iPad so the kids wouldn\u2019t keep asking to do stuff and as a result they were basically raised by the Internet.
