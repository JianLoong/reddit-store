She would tell my brother and I that children are dirty and scream and annoy everybody until they learn to act like adults, which I guess isn't wrong but still hurtful for us to hear as elementary schoolers.\n\nWhat I found the worst about my aunt was how she used to talk about my mom, her older sister. My mom has been single since my dad abandoned us for his affair partner. I've overheard my aunt commenting that my mom's selfish for having children and promiscuous and our dad probably isn't even our real dad which is why he left my mom. When I was 10 I finally told my mom about these comments. She refused to keep us in the same room as our aunt and we've really had no relationship with her.\n\nWhen I was 11, my aunt moved from the same neighborhood as my mom and grandparents to a house in the country about two hours away and I had no real contact with her for the next 7 years. When I was 18, my aunt started trying to reestablish a relationship with me, but I kept my contact with her low.\n\nI've been working for a few years and have saved enough to rent my own apartment. This year, my aunt was hit by a car and has had a whole slew of health problems. Because of that, she's been needing to visit the hospital frequently and will need to start physical therapy. Her house is really far from most health facilities and, because she lives alone, she hasn't got anybody to take her back and forth every day. She doesn't have the money to buy a new house in a more convenient location and she doesn't want to sell her current house because it has lots of land for her dogs and she wants to continue living there when she gets better.\n\nThe rest of my family lives in the city and can access all sorts of health facilities much easier. My brother lives at college. My grandparents have moved in with my mom who's still angry at my aunt and refuses to talk to her. That leaves me. Because I was hesitant and not outright rejecting contact with my aunt, she thinks she still has a chance to live with me.\n\nThere's two major issues with this: 1) my aunt has two dogs that she adores and I don't want to take care of them while she's still recovering, and 2) I don't really like my aunt and don't want her living with me. I'm afraid that a relationship would cause a divide in the family. I'm also worried she'll find out things about me and gossip about it like she did with my mom.\n\nFundamentally, if I had had a closer relationship with my aunt in my childhood I might have considered it, but because of her justifying being cruel by her \"childfree\"-ness I don't think I'm going to make this accommodation for her. I told her as much and she called me an asshole for abandoning her when she's vulnerable. My mom and brother support me but my grandparents told me to just go along with it so that we can all stop fighting.
