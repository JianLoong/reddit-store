{"id": 5735, "submission_id": "zw1zew", "title": "AITA for telling my mom it was wrong to remove me and my siblings as insurance beneficiaries after she got remarried?", "selftext": "I have three sisters. We are all close with my mom and have a good relationship with her. I\u2019m (32f) married with three young children. My second sister (30f) is single, and my third (26f) is married with no kids (yet). We are all in unconventional, financially-unsteady vocations. My mom married my stepfather last year.\n\nMy mom has life insurance totaling $130k. She\u2019s not the healthiest, so talk about death plans has come up to prepare for the future.\n\nShe previously named each of us as her insurance beneficiaries (stepfather 25%, me 25%, sister #1 25%, sister #2 25%). We\u2019ve been insurance beneficiaries since we were teenagers and my mom divorced my dad. But now, she suddenly announced that she decided to give 100% of all the insurance benefits to her new husband. \n\nI expressed that I was confused about this because she had previously officially designated to each of us a 25% share to help us all after she passes. I reminded her that her husband would receive 100% of her social security benefits (thousands of $$) and 100% of her bank account, which is understandable to me, but to leave all of us out of her life insurance as beneficiaries felt dismissive of us.\n\nShe said $130k+ doesn\u2019t go far in America, and that her husband needs all of that money and more to help him with all of his costs after she dies. She\u2019s worried he\u2019ll struggle after she dies.\n\nI told her even if he gets a larger portion of the life insurance (40% for him, 20% each for us siblings), it makes more sense than leaving us out completely.\n\nShe said again, I don\u2019t want him to be poor.\n\nI said, okay, what about us? You have three grandkids. My own monthly earnings is already a struggle as a missionary. Sisters #1 and #2 are artists and work on commission which is up and down depending on if anyone buys their work. We are all on the low-income spectrum. Do you not care about helping us at all when you die? \n\nShe said she never said she doesn\u2019t care, but she just wants to give 100% to her husband. She said her mom didn\u2019t leave her any money when she died.\n\nI told her that grandma actually had no money to give (no life insurance/inheritance), whereas you have $130k+ guaranteed when you die, and you are choosing to leave us with literally 0% while giving your new husband 100%. \n\nShe said finally that if her husband died, she wouldn\u2019t want to be equal to his kids (and therefore receive an equal share with his kids). She expects 100%, therefore she will give him 100%.\n\nShe accused me of wanting a bunch of money and telling her what to do, so I told her I don\u2019t want any of the money and her husband can have it all. I understand her husband comes in first place, but I didn\u2019t expect us to come in at zero place. My sisters are also both upset at hearing the news that we are all left out.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: We love our mom. I\u2019m not waiting for her to die, I hope she lives until she\u2019s 100. If that\u2019s how that came off to you, sorry, not the intention. She has continually told us throughout the years that she wants to give us insurance money to help us after she dies. So this was a different direction she suddenly took. It\u2019s hard to give a bunch of context on a Reddit post.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for taking the time to respond. Some thoughts and answers to common comments:\n\n1) A lot of comments talked about how it\u2019s my mom\u2019s choice to choose her beneficiaries. I agree that it is her own choice. I shouldn\u2019t have told her it was wrong. I was just confused because her repeated statement to me and my sisters is that she was hoping to give us money after she dies from her insurance to help set our families forward in life. She always said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help you more now. But when I die, the insurance money will help you guys,\u201d type of thing. \n\n2) People buy life insurance to cover funeral costs, but also as a legacy blessing for family members, including adult children. The general comments saying that adults with jobs and families shouldn\u2019t be receiving life insurance benefits from their parents is interesting to me. I worked in a hospital for a while and it wasn\u2019t unusual for parents to name their adult children as beneficiaries. Patients had wills, trusts, and life insurance beneficiaries of all ages, so the general shock in the comments that I would \u201cexpect\u201d to be a beneficiary as an \u201cadult\u201d is really odd to me. She made us her beneficiaries when I was 18 years old, with the expectation that we would be adults with families when she died.\n\n3) People keep accusing me of wanting my mom to die to get a payout? Like no I don\u2019t want my mom to die so I can get money\u2026? She\u2019s my mom. I love her a lot and we\u2019re super close. We text everyday and talk every week. Being confused and upset that what was promised to us as a legacy gift since I was a teen because of a new husband 15 years later does not equate wishing someone would die so I can get a hefty payout. \n\n4) Me being a missionary wasn\u2019t at all the point of my post, but I\u2019m sorry that some of you were hurt by your experience of the Church. I hope you can find healing!\n\n5) I\u2019m not sure what will happen if my mom dies and my stepdad dies. I\u2019m pretty sure his assets will not be given to me or my sisters. He has two adult children who he would likely pass the inheritance onto. They are both great, btw.\n\n6) My mom is not dying. We were simply planning for the future together and health directives as she had a close call last year. She has asked me to take care of all this stuff for her as the eldest daughter. And no, end-of-life healthcare costs are not an issue. She has excellent retiree health insurance and benefits working in the hospital for 35 years.", "created_utc": 1672102010, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw1zew/aita_for_telling_my_mom_it_was_wrong_to_remove_me/", "score": 312, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We are all close with my mom and have a good relationship with her. I\u2019m (32f) married with three young children. My second sister (30f) is single, and my third (26f) is married with no kids (yet). We are all in unconventional, financially-unsteady vocations. My mom married my stepfather last year.\n\nMy mom has life insurance totaling $130k. She\u2019s not the healthiest, so talk about death plans has come up to prepare for the future.\n\nShe previously named each of us as her insurance beneficiaries (stepfather 25%, me 25%, sister #1 25%, sister #2 25%). We\u2019ve been insurance beneficiaries since we were teenagers and my mom divorced my dad. But now, she suddenly announced that she decided to give 100% of all the insurance benefits to her new husband. \n\nI expressed that I was confused about this because she had previously officially designated to each of us a 25% share to help us all after she passes. I reminded her that her husband would receive 100% of her social security benefits (thousands of $$) and 100% of her bank account, which is understandable to me, but to leave all of us out of her life insurance as beneficiaries felt dismissive of us.\n\nShe said $130k+ doesn\u2019t go far in America, and that her husband needs all of that money and more to help him with all of his costs after she dies. She\u2019s worried he\u2019ll struggle after she dies.\n\nI told her even if he gets a larger portion of the life insurance (40% for him, 20% each for us siblings), it makes more sense than leaving us out completely.\n\nShe said again, I don\u2019t want him to be poor.\n\nI said, okay, what about us? You have three grandkids. My own monthly earnings is already a struggle as a missionary. Sisters #1 and #2 are artists and work on commission which is up and down depending on if anyone buys their work. We are all on the low-income spectrum. Do you not care about helping us at all when you die? \n\nShe said she never said she doesn\u2019t care, but she just wants to give 100% to her husband. She said her mom didn\u2019t leave her any money when she died.\n\nI told her that grandma actually had no money to give (no life insurance/inheritance), whereas you have $130k+ guaranteed when you die, and you are choosing to leave us with literally 0% while giving your new husband 100%. \n\nShe said finally that if her husband died, she wouldn\u2019t want to be equal to his kids (and therefore receive an equal share with his kids). She expects 100%, therefore she will give him 100%.\n\nShe accused me of wanting a bunch of money and telling her what to do, so I told her I don\u2019t want any of the money and her husband can have it all. I understand her husband comes in first place, but I didn\u2019t expect us to come in at zero place. My sisters are also both upset at hearing the news that we are all left out.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is a nightmare when you do not know what you are doing much less trying to grieve a lost mom.  4.5 months later dad passed.  They had this life insurance that was 20,000 for the two of them but the catch was once one passed they had to fill out paperwork to cover the other one.  The company was back and forth with the paperwork sending it to dad to fill out and then once he had he had to redo it because they said it was wrong.  The last time was right as he passed--my aunt had taken the mail to send out to them.  We waited months for them to decide if they would pay out or not.  It was a nightmare because they did not get the paperwork until after he had passed.  In the end they did let us have it.  It was not much but covered the cremation.

That's it. you have no say what she does with her money just like she doesn't have a say what you do with yours. \n\nWould you like it if she asked you to spend $40k on step father's house renovations now?", "More info.\n\nWhat percentage of your Mom's savings came from your father?  That's the core question for me.  I don't think Stepdad should get anything left over that is your legacy from your Dad in the event that anything is left after your Mom passes, but otherwise it's not surprising that Mom adjusted once you weren't financially dependent on her anymore.", "Agreed.   I think it's less about the actual cash, and more about suddenly the Mum seems to care only about the husband, and not about the kids.  It's an emotional blow.\n\nIf something were to happen to me, and my husband remarried, I would be horrified to think my children would end up with nothing.", "That\u2019s absolutely correct. Her choice to go no contact. And if that\u2019s the case, then her mother needs to respect her daughter\u2019s wishes as well. \n\nBut, considering that the daughter is the entitled AH here, going NC just reiterates her AH behavior. If she goes NC because she\u2019s not getting anything from her mom after she dies, it sounds like she\u2019s only in a relationship with her mom for the money.", "Yeah the person who you live with might be in a tricky financial situation if they suddenly have to pay all of the rent/mortgage/bills.", "You do understand that there are missionaries whose \"job\" is to feed, clothe, and educate people, right? If those people want to learn about the God the missionaries believe wants them to do this, it's their choice.", "Nope.", "I'm sorry for you then.", "Why? Because I\u2019m not stupidly blinded by fake charity? There there.", "That's not what the comment said. Can you not read.", "How was it worded that way but you're the only one who saw it?", "No, it doesn't perpetuate harmful stereotypes, YOU FEEL it perpetuates harmful stereotypes. That's all in your head and why you got downvoted to oblivion.", "Because you're a \"sad, strange little man!\"", "I wrote this several times already but here we go again: I'm not sure if I misread yesterday or if the comment was edited and haven't gotten around to go into browser and check that", "I wrote it in an other comment but will repeat it here: either the comment I originally answered to was edited or I misread it, I can't tell until I have time to go into browser and check", "Sorry to say that but I don't really care about the downvotes.\n\nI see this differently from you and I don't think I can convince you", "The point is you see it different from literally everyone. At that point it's a you problem not an ableism problem. When people think of ableism now, they'll think of that crackpot comment some triggered person left on AITA and not a legitimate problem. You're doing damage to your own cause by being over zealous and jousting at windmills."]}
