{"id": 5735, "submission_id": "zw1zew", "title": "AITA for telling my mom it was wrong to remove me and my siblings as insurance beneficiaries after she got remarried?", "selftext": "I have three sisters. We are all close with my mom and have a good relationship with her. I\u2019m (32f) married with three young children. My second sister (30f) is single, and my third (26f) is married with no kids (yet). We are all in unconventional, financially-unsteady vocations. My mom married my stepfather last year.\n\nMy mom has life insurance totaling $130k. She\u2019s not the healthiest, so talk about death plans has come up to prepare for the future.\n\nShe previously named each of us as her insurance beneficiaries (stepfather 25%, me 25%, sister #1 25%, sister #2 25%). We\u2019ve been insurance beneficiaries since we were teenagers and my mom divorced my dad. But now, she suddenly announced that she decided to give 100% of all the insurance benefits to her new husband. \n\nI expressed that I was confused about this because she had previously officially designated to each of us a 25% share to help us all after she passes. I reminded her that her husband would receive 100% of her social security benefits (thousands of $$) and 100% of her bank account, which is understandable to me, but to leave all of us out of her life insurance as beneficiaries felt dismissive of us.\n\nShe said $130k+ doesn\u2019t go far in America, and that her husband needs all of that money and more to help him with all of his costs after she dies. She\u2019s worried he\u2019ll struggle after she dies.\n\nI told her even if he gets a larger portion of the life insurance (40% for him, 20% each for us siblings), it makes more sense than leaving us out completely.\n\nShe said again, I don\u2019t want him to be poor.\n\nI said, okay, what about us? You have three grandkids. My own monthly earnings is already a struggle as a missionary. Sisters #1 and #2 are artists and work on commission which is up and down depending on if anyone buys their work. We are all on the low-income spectrum. Do you not care about helping us at all when you die? \n\nShe said she never said she doesn\u2019t care, but she just wants to give 100% to her husband. She said her mom didn\u2019t leave her any money when she died.\n\nI told her that grandma actually had no money to give (no life insurance/inheritance), whereas you have $130k+ guaranteed when you die, and you are choosing to leave us with literally 0% while giving your new husband 100%. \n\nShe said finally that if her husband died, she wouldn\u2019t want to be equal to his kids (and therefore receive an equal share with his kids). She expects 100%, therefore she will give him 100%.\n\nShe accused me of wanting a bunch of money and telling her what to do, so I told her I don\u2019t want any of the money and her husband can have it all. I understand her husband comes in first place, but I didn\u2019t expect us to come in at zero place. My sisters are also both upset at hearing the news that we are all left out.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: We love our mom. I\u2019m not waiting for her to die, I hope she lives until she\u2019s 100. If that\u2019s how that came off to you, sorry, not the intention. She has continually told us throughout the years that she wants to give us insurance money to help us after she dies. So this was a different direction she suddenly took.

But you\u2019re not an asshole for getting upset and discouraged over this or for questioning why. It\u2019s not her responsibility to make sure you or your sisters are financially successful as adults, but I personally think (in a healthy family) that parents should always look out for their children\u2019s futures before they die.

We are all close with my mom and have a good relationship with her. I\u2019m (32f) married with three young children. My second sister (30f) is single, and my third (26f) is married with no kids (yet). We are all in unconventional, financially-unsteady vocations. My mom married my stepfather last year.\n\nMy mom has life insurance totaling $130k. She\u2019s not the healthiest, so talk about death plans has come up to prepare for the future.\n\nShe previously named each of us as her insurance beneficiaries (stepfather 25%, me 25%, sister #1 25%, sister #2 25%). We\u2019ve been insurance beneficiaries since we were teenagers and my mom divorced my dad. But now, she suddenly announced that she decided to give 100% of all the insurance benefits to her new husband. \n\nI expressed that I was confused about this because she had previously officially designated to each of us a 25% share to help us all after she passes. I reminded her that her husband would receive 100% of her social security benefits (thousands of $$) and 100% of her bank account, which is understandable to me, but to leave all of us out of her life insurance as beneficiaries felt dismissive of us.\n\nShe said $130k+ doesn\u2019t go far in America, and that her husband needs all of that money and more to help him with all of his costs after she dies. She\u2019s worried he\u2019ll struggle after she dies.\n\nI told her even if he gets a larger portion of the life insurance (40% for him, 20% each for us siblings), it makes more sense than leaving us out completely.\n\nShe said again, I don\u2019t want him to be poor.\n\nI said, okay, what about us? You have three grandkids. My own monthly earnings is already a struggle as a missionary. Sisters #1 and #2 are artists and work on commission which is up and down depending on if anyone buys their work. We are all on the low-income spectrum. Do you not care about helping us at all when you die? \n\nShe said she never said she doesn\u2019t care, but she just wants to give 100% to her husband. She said her mom didn\u2019t leave her any money when she died.\n\nI told her that grandma actually had no money to give (no life insurance/inheritance), whereas you have $130k+ guaranteed when you die, and you are choosing to leave us with literally 0% while giving your new husband 100%. \n\nShe said finally that if her husband died, she wouldn\u2019t want to be equal to his kids (and therefore receive an equal share with his kids). She expects 100%, therefore she will give him 100%.\n\nShe accused me of wanting a bunch of money and telling her what to do, so I told her I don\u2019t want any of the money and her husband can have it all. I understand her husband comes in first place, but I didn\u2019t expect us to come in at zero place. My sisters are also both upset at hearing the news that we are all left out.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When mom passed first, I helped my dad walk through calling her doctors, pharmacy, and other places to let them know she passed; called SSO to let them know and find out the next steps we had to take; called insurance to let them know as well.  It is a nightmare when you do not know what you are doing much less trying to grieve a lost mom.  4.5 months later dad passed.  They had this life insurance that was 20,000 for the two of them but the catch was once one passed they had to fill out paperwork to cover the other one.  The company was back and forth with the paperwork sending it to dad to fill out and then once he had he had to redo it because they said it was wrong.  The last time was right as he passed--my aunt had taken the mail to send out to them.  We waited months for them to decide if they would pay out or not.  It was a nightmare because they did not get the paperwork until after he had passed.  In the end they did let us have it.  It was not much but covered the cremation.  But we had to have at least copies of the death certificates before we could shut of utilities or transfer them over to us and then we had to wait for probate before we could touch anything.

She probably provided for them throughout their childhood up until they became adults, as most parents do, fulfilling her responsibility to them.\n\n>she's chosen to worry about his future more than yours\n\nOf course because most likely an elderly man is less likely to be able to provide for himself than 3 adult women, who presumably have husbands/ baby dadddies to help them.\n\nThe fact that they chose unstable paths for themselves, is not her responsability. I respect choosing passion over money, but that does not entitle them to someone elses money. \n\n> to worry about his future more than yours. She's your mother and it feels like she should care about you more than she seems to. It's hurtful\n\nThis is soooo manipulative. The fact thay she won't give them money when they are perfectly capable of providing for themselves does not mean she does not care. \n\n>but you can tell her that you feel that her behavior demonstrates that you and your siblings that she doesn't value you the way that you used to.

Usually in this situation the survivor gets to keep assets like house, rvs, cars until they to pass after which they are sold off and money split (usually unequally like one person gets assets from insurance and the other gets the house or even half of the house equity) between the separate families. That way no one family takes it all.. seems like mom was gaslighted.", "They are not children", "Life insurance is meant to help offset the impact of your death with financial help going to those who most depend on your income. It's not a present for those you care about the most.
