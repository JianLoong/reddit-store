I was honestly sad that he wasn't at all happy to see me and was mostly angry.\n\nMy parents kept calling me asking me to come back but I said I didnt want to disturb Mike's night.

Maybe leaving wasn\u2019t a great idea because that obviously made a scene which turned the attention to you again.", "NTA. Unless you're leaving out some critical information, youre obviously not the asshole here. I wonder, in truth, what your brother actually thought you should have done? Straight up lie?", "I'd do some soul searching to see if you can see his side of the story. You mention that it's your golden weekend. I assume that's some birthday thing. Who cares, why mention that? Then instead of saying you went, you say you traveled there 6 hours by plane...you seem to be a person who likes to talk about themselves and the great things you do. You can't help yourself. Were you really just innocently chatting at the party? I'm not actually asking you to tell me/us, but just spend some time thinking about it. Here just in an anonymous Reddit post you're talking yourself up unnecessarily.", "It's funny how if your brother had posted this he probably would have got a lot of sympathy about your family having a golden child. You get sympathy for being innocent and him being insecure and attention-seeking.\n\nI think only your family know the truth about this. Maybe have a long hard look at the past and how you were both treated and have an honest conversation with your brother if you want to save the relationship. \n\nHe clearly feels you were favoured, maybe talking from 2 different viewpoints on your childhood will help clear this up. You don't know what your parents are like when you're not there. There may have been comparisons you were not aware of.

You could have just been quieter for the rest of the night.", "ESH.

And if your parents recognized the tantrum you threw, that says a lot.", "YTA for leaving. \nHe was probably over reacting a bit when people were giving you a lot of attention on his day but you made it worse by over reacting so much that you left.  \n\nYou both sound like a couple of babies.  Time to grow up.  If you are supposed to be the smart one it's time to act like it.", "I don\u2019t understand the obsession with being the only centre of attention in weddings and engagement parties.

Not answering their questions would be rude so if he *must* be mad at someone, it should be them, not you. If I'd been made to feel guilty for something that wasn't my fault I'd probably leave as well.", "NTA naturally your family would ask questions and you answered. You didn't steal the show and you left when needed. He wanted to have his spot light and he did. It would of caused more of a scene if you stayed and was quiet and ignoring questions.", "NTA.

Were you supposed to say, sorry I can't answer any questions about my life today? I  would have left too.", "NTA. Sounds like your brother is simply an envious loser. I'd avoid him as much as possible.", "NTA - holy crow, did he expect you to just hide in a corner all night and not talk to anyone?

Did he expect family and friends to shower them with attention the entire time?  Were you distracting people from the party games or whatever it is people even do at engagement parties besides mingle?", "Nta.

So the one time the focus should be on him, it all starts to shift back to his sister.", "He expected to be the sole topic of conversation even when he wasn\u2019t actively talking to those people. He decided that because it\u2019s his party he is the only acceptable topic of discussion", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t go to the wedding.", "Maybe his brother is self-conscious because OP has dates with reputable doctors or something and he is marrying a \"normal\" girl (who is not a doctor or anything \"important\"). In any case, it's still a brother self-esteem issue.", "Genuinely curious, since when is quietly leaving without causing a scene a tantrum?

I think these are very normal questions to ask a family member you haven\u2019t seen for years. There\u2019s nothing \u201cgolden child\u201d about these questions. \n\nAnd OP answering the questions isn\u2019t bragging either. What should she have answered instead? I\u2019m sorry aunt, I cannot tell you where I work because my brother feels like I\u2019m outdoing him. I\u2019m sorry cousin, I cannot tell you if I\u2019m dating anyone because my brother doesn\u2019t allow it. That would be totally weird.\n\nIt\u2019s very unreasonable to expect OP to make herself invisible and sit in a corner all evening without talking to any of her family members because her brother wants to be the center of attention. If she\u2019s invited she should be allowed to interact with her family members and answer the questions about her life honestly. If OP\u2019s brother has a problem with her talking about her residency, because that\u2019s *\u201doutdoing\u201d* him and it makes him feel less, he shouldn\u2019t have invited her. Op is NTA for leaving.", "This is the probable answer. Unfortunately the way the brother handled it gave OP\nno other option except to leave.\n\nOP is NTA, But a heart to heart with her brother is definitely in order to get to the bottom of it. If she has golden child syndrome unknowingly now would be a good time to p ut it to rest.\n\nSince she is in residency its unlikely she has the time or band width to properly deal with it now, which is also unfortunate.", "I don\u2019t see it like this at all. I think OP just hasn\u2019t seen a lot of family in a long time so they\u2019re curious as to what she\u2019s up to excited to see her.", "i never want to see the phrase golden child on reddit again. yall have ruined it", "I figured someone came up to thank him for the invite and mentioned \"How lovely it was to see OP, she is doing so well.\".

It\u2019s family and friends who have been busy and are catching up. They are allowed to talk about things other than the couple.", "That's a good guess, I think.", "I'm wondering the same thing. I'm sorry, but talking exclusively about ONE topic for an entire party would get REALLY boring REALLY quick. Yes, the couple should be the focus of the event, but that doesn't mean they have to be the ONLY thing everyone talks about the entire night.", "Nyuk", "Sure!

OP is doing exciting things and they haven\u2019t seen her in a long time. There\u2019s a lot more to talk about with her and they (the family members) let themselves get carried away with that. And there\u2019s a history of everybody praising OP more, so the return of this got on Mike\u2019s nerves.\n\nBut it\u2019s not her family reunion, it\u2019s Mike\u2019s engagement party.", "I don't think OP is the asshole, but I don't think the brother is either.\n\nPerhaps I'm just more sensitive to it. I was the younger brother who's achievements were always dismissed by family because my older brother was better. You can try to hide it but it always stings and lingers in the back of your mind.\n\nOn this occasion I think OPs brother wasn't able to hide \"why are they focusing on her again\" and lashed out. At the wrong person but I can understand the reaction.", "Yeah, my guess is he is really insecure and blames OP for that. He probably would have been fine with normal small talk between other people.\n\nWho the heck thinks *dating* is a competition between siblings?
