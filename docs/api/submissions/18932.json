I was honestly sad that he wasn't at all happy to see me and was mostly angry.\n\nMy parents kept calling me asking me to come back but I said I didnt want to disturb Mike's night.

Maybe leaving wasn\u2019t a great idea because that obviously made a scene which turned the attention to you again.", "NTA. Unless you're leaving out some critical information, youre obviously not the asshole here. I wonder, in truth, what your brother actually thought you should have done? Straight up lie?", "I'd do some soul searching to see if you can see his side of the story. You mention that it's your golden weekend. I assume that's some birthday thing. Who cares, why mention that? Then instead of saying you went, you say you traveled there 6 hours by plane...you seem to be a person who likes to talk about themselves and the great things you do. You can't help yourself. Were you really just innocently chatting at the party? I'm not actually asking you to tell me/us, but just spend some time thinking about it. Here just in an anonymous Reddit post you're talking yourself up unnecessarily.", "It's funny how if your brother had posted this he probably would have got a lot of sympathy about your family having a golden child. You get sympathy for being innocent and him being insecure and attention-seeking.\n\nI think only your family know the truth about this. Maybe have a long hard look at the past and how you were both treated and have an honest conversation with your brother if you want to save the relationship. \n\nHe clearly feels you were favoured, maybe talking from 2 different viewpoints on your childhood will help clear this up. You don't know what your parents are like when you're not there. There may have been comparisons you were not aware of. Or he may just be attention seeking? you won't know until you ask and listen openly.", "Info were you the golden child growing up?

You could have just been quieter for the rest of the night.", "ESH.

And if your parents recognized the tantrum you threw, that says a lot.", "YTA for leaving. \nHe was probably over reacting a bit when people were giving you a lot of attention on his day but you made it worse by over reacting so much that you left.  \n\nYou both sound like a couple of babies.  Time to grow up.  If you are supposed to be the smart one it's time to act like it.", "I don\u2019t understand the obsession with being the only centre of attention in weddings and engagement parties.

Not answering their questions would be rude so if he *must* be mad at someone, it should be them, not you. If I'd been made to feel guilty for something that wasn't my fault I'd probably leave as well.", "NTA naturally your family would ask questions and you answered. You didn't steal the show and you left when needed. He wanted to have his spot light and he did. It would of caused more of a scene if you stayed and was quiet and ignoring questions.", "NTA.

Were you supposed to say, sorry I can't answer any questions about my life today? I  would have left too.", "NTA. Sounds like your brother is simply an envious loser. I'd avoid him as much as possible.", "NTA - holy crow, did he expect you to just hide in a corner all night and not talk to anyone?

Did he expect family and friends to shower them with attention the entire time?  Were you distracting people from the party games or whatever it is people even do at engagement parties besides mingle?", "Nta.

So the one time the focus should be on him, it all starts to shift back to his sister.", "He expected to be the sole topic of conversation even when he wasn\u2019t actively talking to those people. He decided that because it\u2019s his party he is the only acceptable topic of discussion", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t go to the wedding.", "Maybe his brother is self-conscious because OP has dates with reputable doctors or something and he is marrying a \"normal\" girl (who is not a doctor or anything \"important\").

I think these are very normal questions to ask a family member you haven\u2019t seen for years. There\u2019s nothing \u201cgolden child\u201d about these questions. \n\nAnd OP answering the questions isn\u2019t bragging either. What should she have answered instead? I\u2019m sorry aunt, I cannot tell you where I work because my brother feels like I\u2019m outdoing him. I\u2019m sorry cousin, I cannot tell you if I\u2019m dating anyone because my brother doesn\u2019t allow it. That would be totally weird.\n\nIt\u2019s very unreasonable to expect OP to make herself invisible and sit in a corner all evening without talking to any of her family members because her brother wants to be the center of attention. If she\u2019s invited she should be allowed to interact with her family members and answer the questions about her life honestly. If OP\u2019s brother has a problem with her talking about her residency, because that\u2019s *\u201doutdoing\u201d* him and it makes him feel less, he shouldn\u2019t have invited her. Op is NTA for leaving.", "This is the probable answer. Unfortunately the way the brother handled it gave OP\nno other option except to leave.\n\nOP is NTA, But a heart to heart with her brother is definitely in order to get to the bottom of it. If she has golden child syndrome unknowingly now would be a good time to p ut it to rest.\n\nSince she is in residency its unlikely she has the time or band width to properly deal with it now, which is also unfortunate.", "I don\u2019t see it like this at all. I think OP just hasn\u2019t seen a lot of family in a long time so they\u2019re curious as to what she\u2019s up to excited to see her.", "i never want to see the phrase golden child on reddit again. yall have ruined it", "I figured someone came up to thank him for the invite and mentioned \"How lovely it was to see OP, she is doing so well.\".

It\u2019s family and friends who have been busy and are catching up. They are allowed to talk about things other than the couple.", "That's a good guess, I think.", "I'm wondering the same thing. I'm sorry, but talking exclusively about ONE topic for an entire party would get REALLY boring REALLY quick. Yes, the couple should be the focus of the event, but that doesn't mean they have to be the ONLY thing everyone talks about the entire night.", "Nyuk", "Sure!

OP is doing exciting things and they haven\u2019t seen her in a long time. There\u2019s a lot more to talk about with her and they (the family members) let themselves get carried away with that. And there\u2019s a history of everybody praising OP more, so the return of this got on Mike\u2019s nerves.\n\nBut it\u2019s not her family reunion, it\u2019s Mike\u2019s engagement party.", "I don't think OP is the asshole, but I don't think the brother is either.\n\nPerhaps I'm just more sensitive to it. I was the younger brother who's achievements were always dismissed by family because my older brother was better. You can try to hide it but it always stings and lingers in the back of your mind.\n\nOn this occasion I think OPs brother wasn't able to hide \"why are they focusing on her again\" and lashed out. At the wrong person but I can understand the reaction.", "Yeah, my guess is he is really insecure and blames OP for that.

I\u2019ve been to many parties celebrating things like engagements, graduations, promotions, etc. I assure you, conversation did not center on the occasion for the party.

He gets angry with me because he thinks I am bragging about having better mental health than him (which isn't 100% accurate as I take medication for anxiety and also see a therapist) and that my ways of helping are actually how I put him down. There's not much I can do to change this mindset because it stems from years of baggage and dysfunctional family relationships. It makes me incredibly sad because I desperately want a good relationship with my brother but it sometimes feels like the best thing for him is for me to disappear because when he is around me and when I try to help, it brings up all of these old terrible feelings. I'm honestly struggling to figure out how to move forward at this point.\n\nYour brother has a lot of baggage and it's understandable, but he shouldn't have taken it out on you when it's the overall situation that angered him. I don't think you did anything wrong at the party but just leaving (I get that's what you think he wanted but that wasn't what he said) probably sent the wrong message. \n\nI feel like you could have maybe presented options and asked what he wanted from you. And one of those options is \"I am not bragging; I am just answering questions truthfully. I'm sorry if it upsets you but I didn't want to be rude to your guests by dodging their questions. What can I do differently? Would you prefer that I leave so I am not a distraction? I don't want to ruin your night.\" From his standpoint, I could see how he might have thought you were throwing a tantrum and causing drama by leaving...because that might be how he would handle a similar situation given his misplaced anger towards you here. \n\nThat being said, it is a very soft ESH because I don't think you really did anything terribly wrong here and your brother definitely overreacted and blamed the wrong person. But I do think that it would have been helpful to the overall situation to explain why you are thinking of leaving (to keep the focus on him and not cause more tension vs leaving because you were pissed off) as well as making clear that you aren't bragging; you are just answering people's questions. He is definitely the bigger asshole here but I think you could have handled things better instead of just leaving.", "It means weekends off are rare.", "Jesus wasted a weekend?", "You're right. OP should have stayed home and not gone to the party because she had the audacity to be academically inclined and well behaved. She also shouldn't go to the wedding. Better yet, she should never leave her house again, or even turn on the lights lest she draw attention to herself. She should sit in darkness for the rest of her life as penance for something over which she had no control. </s>\n\nNTA", "I honestly suspect,  while he made the rounds gladhanding and accepting congratulations, some guest/s who had previously spoken to the sister mentioned something in passing that she had said and he got all butt hurt. Poor sister never knew that there was a script to follow and that her answers were only to be: I couldn\u2019t say, I don\u2019t know, how about the weather , isn\u2019t brother and fianc\u00e9e\u2019s engagement exciting?, have you tried the hors d\u2019oeuvres?", "This! They asked questions and she answered. There was nothing narcissistic about it.", ">NTA. OP hasn't seen the family in years. \n\nIt's almost as if there aren't these things called phones or the internet, which I kid you not is a world wide web where you can talk to people, face to face from not only another state but another country.\n\nSarcasm aside are you seriously trying to tell me that she didn't talk to any in the family for 8 years? You are lying to yourself if you believe that is true.\n\nAgain as mentioned I don't think OP is the asshole here. She needs to have a sit down with her brother at some point because you don't go from zero to you always take the spotlight in a single event.", "I think that was OP providing context, not bragging. As in \"I was academically inclined so my parents tended to give me the benefit of the doubt which is why my brother may have felt this way.\"", "Or that one's feelings about a situation can change when presented with multiple points of view!", "I also don't think parents usually throw engagement parties for the Scapegoat.", "Then he needs therapy/counseling. She did nothing wrong.", "\"Especially with the travel. My brain is mush\" is exactly why it's unreasonable to expect OP to pull this off. People who have just come from the spa after sleeping for eight hours have a hard time pulling this off. OP had just disembarked from a six hour flight.", "She was catching up with family and that's a perfectly normal thing to do. Doesn't sound like everyone was sitting at one table but even then you talk to the people around you.", "Is it possible that your parents compared him with you when he did these things? As in after he got caught, that a lot of the conversations contained a version of \"why can't you be more like OP?\" or \"take an example to OP\" or \"I wish you tried harder, it's not impossible, look at OP\"? If that is the case, your parents might have unknowingly caused him to have resentments towards you. Because, in his mind, he was never going to be as good as you in their eyes, so why bother? And while that might not have been the case, that's the perspective he grew up with, which is difficult to let go off.", "This!!!!! Like y\u2019all please be serious. And honestly you expect someone to hold personal and engaging conversations until after I exclusive talk about two people I kind of know about due to distance.", "She should have stayed and practiced her social skills.  You know, minimized the other relatives coming up to her, redirecting them to the engaged couple, etc.  Also, asking others about themselves or even asking the engaged couple to relate stories of how they met, etc.  I think it was immature to leave. I think her brother is the AH.", "ESH.  He shouldn\u2019t have made the comment and you should not have left", "I\u2019m probably gonna be bold by saying NAH. Your brother shouldn\u2019t have made you feel like he wants you to leave, then get mad that you leave, but I also completely understand feeling shadowed by another sibling. So yes it\u2019s most likely coming out of insecurity, but I do get that he just wanted his special night to be about him. On the other hand, you haven\u2019t done anything wrong. You can\u2019t help that people are showing an interest in your life after a long time apart. Only thing I could suggest you\u2019d do instead of leave is maybe direct some of the questions you get back to your brother, to the engagement and all that.", "YTA. If you know you haven\u2019t seen family in a long time and you\u2019re coming to celebrate someone else\u2019s event, then you organize an event to catch up at another time. This is basic social etiquette. When I was with my ex, we both lived on the opposite side of the country than the rest of his family. When we went back to visit around when his brother got accepted into grad school, we made sure to check in with family before the celebration for his brother so we could all catch up without taking the spotlight off of a significant event for his brother.", "YTA. You know that it was not meant for your to leave the party and in that call more attention to yourself by your absence from party. What any guest does at a party in honor of someone else is your deflect questions about yourself and redirect to the people being honored. A brief reply with now details and then redirect to speak of the newly engaged couple. Your language tells of how you condense to your brother by calling him rebellious artistic on and you are on a pedestal calling out how calm you are. You sound annoying.", "Well if this is how OPs brother feels, hopefully this incident will give him the window to have a frank conversation with his parents which is apparently overdue. \n\nHowever, IMO There is nothing in this post to suggest this is true. OP hasn\u2019t been home very much in the last 8 years so couldn\u2019t be accused of always trying to take the spotlight at events. Also parents threw the brother an engagement party to celebrate the brother. This isn\u2019t exactly \u2018dismissive\u2019. \n\nI have never been to an engagement party or indeed any event where it was considered rude to catch up with friends and family asking them how they\u2019ve been or what they are up to. You never make big announcements at other people\u2019s events, but it\u2019s expected to talk about how work and personal life is going.", "Unfortunately questions which may include \"can you tell me what this is?\" ::raises shirt to show off gross-looking mole::", "Lmao", "Don't forget, \"golden weekend\". She couldn't just say she had a rare weekend off, she had to use \"golden weekend\" terminology because you know she's going to be a doctor and all that."]}
