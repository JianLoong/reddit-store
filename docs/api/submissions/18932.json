As per tradition, our parents said they'd throw them an engagement party and of course, invited me.

I didn't even make it to Christmas for a few years.\n\nLuckily for me, Mike's engagement party was on my golden weekend. I travelled 6 hours by plane and made it to the party and congratulated Mike in person. Also, I got to see my aunts, uncles, cousins and everyone I hadn't seen for a long while. They were asking about what I was doing, how my rotations were, etc.\n\nMike pulled me aside and told me to please stop stealing the show again on his godd##n ebgagement party. I was confused. All I did was literally show up. So I asked him what was going on. He said I kept outdoing him at everything and even stole the show on his engagement party.\n\nBackground info, between the two of us, I was the calm, academically inclined one who was a straight A student, and recently started residency. He was the artistically inclined troublemaker. However, from my perspective that was 8 years ago and I only visited a handful of times during these years.\n\nI told him I was sorry and asked him what he would like me to do. He told me to stop doing what I was doing, and not brag about my job, dating life or anything else. Mind you, I was being asked questions, not bragging. I thought he simply wanted me to leave his party based on this and left, saying he could enjoy the spotlight as he pleased. I was honestly sad that he wasn't at all happy to see me and was mostly angry.\n\nMy parents kept calling me asking me to come back but I said I didnt want to disturb Mike's night. My parents think I was an AH and caused a scene, as does Mike. I told them about Mike's comments and they are now outraged at him. Everyone's in a conflict more or less.

You learn about others and ask them details in their personal lives.   \n\nI do not feel there was malicious intension on your end to upstage him.", "Wow. It\u2019s a total shocker that you haven\u2019t visited home very often in the last few years. It\u2019s a total mystery. NTA", "NTA. Mike is still the teenager in competition with you, and he considers your answering of direct questions to be bragging. There was no way you could win here, unless, I don't know, travel back in time and drop out of school? I think it's pretty clear why you rarely go back to visit if this is indicative of the sort of treatment you get when you simply answer questions.", "NTA, your brother clearly has some weird sibling rivalry issues going on.", " NTA.  Your brother made it clear that your presence was upsetting him.  Your choices, I guess, were to stay mute or leave - of course you left.  \n\nEveryone else\u2019s feelings are their problem - Mike, your parents, whoever can fight it out themselves.  \n\n(I think I would be \u201con call\u201d for the wedding.

You did the right thing by leaving.", "YTA seems like you were the golden child and he somehow became the spare eventhough he is older. Kind of like an Everbody Loves Raymond thing. He wanted to feel like this was his night (brides want this too). He probably expected people to be talking about him and his bride to be. Instead he ended up feeling like his engagement party was really a welcome home party for his sibling.", "ESH\n\nThat wasnt right of him to say. Its been 8 years since  he's seen you and he didn't handle the reunion well. He shouldn't have said those things...for that he's an AH.\n\nI can see why you were hurt, but the way you just left wasnt very mature and your response couldve been more better. For that youre also in the wrong.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

That'd be absolutely ridiculous and probably boring as hell for the guests.  When people get together talking and catching up with others is completely normal.  \n\nOP was not the AH.
