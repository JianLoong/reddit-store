I was honestly sad that he wasn't at all happy to see me and was mostly angry.\n\nMy parents kept calling me asking me to come back but I said I didnt want to disturb Mike's night.

Maybe leaving wasn\u2019t a great idea because that obviously made a scene which turned the attention to you again.", "NTA. Unless you're leaving out some critical information, youre obviously not the asshole here. I wonder, in truth, what your brother actually thought you should have done? Straight up lie?", "I'd do some soul searching to see if you can see his side of the story. You mention that it's your golden weekend. I assume that's some birthday thing. Who cares, why mention that? Then instead of saying you went, you say you traveled there 6 hours by plane...you seem to be a person who likes to talk about themselves and the great things you do. You can't help yourself. Were you really just innocently chatting at the party? I'm not actually asking you to tell me/us, but just spend some time thinking about it. Here just in an anonymous Reddit post you're talking yourself up unnecessarily.", "It's funny how if your brother had posted this he probably would have got a lot of sympathy about your family having a golden child. You get sympathy for being innocent and him being insecure and attention-seeking.\n\nI think only your family know the truth about this. Maybe have a long hard look at the past and how you were both treated and have an honest conversation with your brother if you want to save the relationship. \n\nHe clearly feels you were favoured, maybe talking from 2 different viewpoints on your childhood will help clear this up. You don't know what your parents are like when you're not there. There may have been comparisons you were not aware of. Or he may just be attention seeking? you won't know until you ask and listen openly.", "Info were you the golden child growing up?

You could have just been quieter for the rest of the night.", "ESH.

And if your parents recognized the tantrum you threw, that says a lot.", "YTA for leaving. \nHe was probably over reacting a bit when people were giving you a lot of attention on his day but you made it worse by over reacting so much that you left.  \n\nYou both sound like a couple of babies.  Time to grow up.  If you are supposed to be the smart one it's time to act like it.", "I don\u2019t understand the obsession with being the only centre of attention in weddings and engagement parties.

Not answering their questions would be rude so if he *must* be mad at someone, it should be them, not you. If I'd been made to feel guilty for something that wasn't my fault I'd probably leave as well.", "NTA naturally your family would ask questions and you answered. You didn't steal the show and you left when needed. He wanted to have his spot light and he did. It would of caused more of a scene if you stayed and was quiet and ignoring questions.", "NTA.

Were you supposed to say, sorry I can't answer any questions about my life today? I  would have left too.", "NTA. Sounds like your brother is simply an envious loser. I'd avoid him as much as possible.", "NTA - holy crow, did he expect you to just hide in a corner all night and not talk to anyone?

Did he expect family and friends to shower them with attention the entire time?  Were you distracting people from the party games or whatever it is people even do at engagement parties besides mingle?", "Nta.

So the one time the focus should be on him, it all starts to shift back to his sister.", "He expected to be the sole topic of conversation even when he wasn\u2019t actively talking to those people. He decided that because it\u2019s his party he is the only acceptable topic of discussion", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t go to the wedding.", "Maybe his brother is self-conscious because OP has dates with reputable doctors or something and he is marrying a \"normal\" girl (who is not a doctor or anything \"important\").

I think these are very normal questions to ask a family member you haven\u2019t seen for years. There\u2019s nothing \u201cgolden child\u201d about these questions. \n\nAnd OP answering the questions isn\u2019t bragging either. What should she have answered instead? I\u2019m sorry aunt, I cannot tell you where I work because my brother feels like I\u2019m outdoing him. I\u2019m sorry cousin, I cannot tell you if I\u2019m dating anyone because my brother doesn\u2019t allow it. That would be totally weird.\n\nIt\u2019s very unreasonable to expect OP to make herself invisible and sit in a corner all evening without talking to any of her family members because her brother wants to be the center of attention. If she\u2019s invited she should be allowed to interact with her family members and answer the questions about her life honestly. If OP\u2019s brother has a problem with her talking about her residency, because that\u2019s *\u201doutdoing\u201d* him and it makes him feel less, he shouldn\u2019t have invited her. Op is NTA for leaving.", "This is the probable answer. Unfortunately the way the brother handled it gave OP\nno other option except to leave.\n\nOP is NTA, But a heart to heart with her brother is definitely in order to get to the bottom of it. If she has golden child syndrome unknowingly now would be a good time to p ut it to rest.\n\nSince she is in residency its unlikely she has the time or band width to properly deal with it now, which is also unfortunate.", "I don\u2019t see it like this at all. I think OP just hasn\u2019t seen a lot of family in a long time so they\u2019re curious as to what she\u2019s up to excited to see her.", "i never want to see the phrase golden child on reddit again. yall have ruined it", "I figured someone came up to thank him for the invite and mentioned \"How lovely it was to see OP, she is doing so well.\".

It\u2019s family and friends who have been busy and are catching up. They are allowed to talk about things other than the couple.", "That's a good guess, I think.", "I'm wondering the same thing. I'm sorry, but talking exclusively about ONE topic for an entire party would get REALLY boring REALLY quick. Yes, the couple should be the focus of the event, but that doesn't mean they have to be the ONLY thing everyone talks about the entire night.", "Nyuk", "Sure!

OP is doing exciting things and they haven\u2019t seen her in a long time. There\u2019s a lot more to talk about with her and they (the family members) let themselves get carried away with that. And there\u2019s a history of everybody praising OP more, so the return of this got on Mike\u2019s nerves.\n\nBut it\u2019s not her family reunion, it\u2019s Mike\u2019s engagement party.", "I don't think OP is the asshole, but I don't think the brother is either.\n\nPerhaps I'm just more sensitive to it. I was the younger brother who's achievements were always dismissed by family because my older brother was better. You can try to hide it but it always stings and lingers in the back of your mind.\n\nOn this occasion I think OPs brother wasn't able to hide \"why are they focusing on her again\" and lashed out. At the wrong person but I can understand the reaction.", "Yeah, my guess is he is really insecure and blames OP for that.

It\u2019s natural for them to want to talk to her and find out things about what she\u2019s doing, but it would start to feel more like a party in her honour than his \u2014 even though he overlooked that she came back for him when she hadn\u2019t come back before.

At our engagement party, I didn\u2019t have time (or care) to police everyone\u2019s conversations. That\u2019s just wild to me.", "You literally said to deflect and not answer their questions. That\u2019s so unreasonable and a bit rude. I could understand if someone came up to her during a speech or performance or something, but to just flat out not answer questions about her life (and I\u2019m assuming her ask the same of others) simply because they\u2019re at an engagement party? No, that\u2019s really rude.", "Woah what happened to the good vibes dude?\n\nThat wasn\u2019t fake the whole time, was it?", "Because people like OPs brother and anyone supporting him need legitimate clinical help if they think OP is somehow the asshole for engaging in casual conversation with people she hasn\u2019t seen in a while\n\nIt triggers me that people actually exist that are so self absorbed that they think an entire parties conversation has to exclusively be about themselves\n\nDo you disagree with any of that?", "I\u2019m not married but have gone to engagement parties, baby showers, bridal showers, etc. and the people of honor always joined in on the conversations we were having and never cared that it had nothing to do with them. If I haven\u2019t seen the person in a while they are usually more than excited to see me and talk about my life (in addition to me talking about theirs). I also wonder if maybe the brothers fianc\u00e9 had the problem and he was acting out on her behalf. Seems likely they haven\u2019t met before and she could be jealous.", "I didn't say to not answer questions, I said to try to mitigate it so you don't derail someone else's event, even if it's not your intention nor the intention of others. Just try to keep it from snowballing. \n\nOP knew they hadn't been around for a while and it sounds like this wasn't an unexpected response of interest from everyone there. Be social, mill around, acknowledge peoples' interest and your want to bond and share but make a time for that so you aren't unintentionally hijacking someone else's event. \n\nAgain, they aren't mutually exclusive, and they aren't all or nothing. I'll never understand peoples' reticence to compromise.", "I don't disagree. My point is that it is 100% not that serious, calm down.", "That is certainly a possibility though brothers reaction reeks of jealousy so I doubt he did it entirely for the fianc\u00e9e.", ">Deflect them with, \"It's great to see you and I look forward to to catching up, let's do lunch/dinner tomorrow, today's all about Mike and (fiance's name).\" or if they can't do lunch/meet up \"I'll call later and we can have a long chat.\"\n\nCopied from your comment. Your exact words. This is rude and unnecessary.", "Lmfao nah I\u2019m good, I think I\u2019ll continue to comment on what I feel like commenting on without your approval."]}
