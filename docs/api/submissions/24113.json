Eating the LAST ONE is plain disrespectful.", "NTA\n\nYou don't take the last of something that you didn't buy.", "NTA.  You need to continue to refuse her access to the Cliff bars or her behavior will continue and you will constantly be without.", "NTA. The issue here is actually that your girlfriend doesn't consider you when she goes about her day. You don't mind sharing these things, you mind having a consistent plan for something that sounds like a big party of your life that you reguarly can't actually do because she has made it harder. It might be she doesn't get why this is important to you beyond the bars? Like how frustrating and disappointing it is and how it's sad and stressful when you get up with your plan only to find she's put you in this position by not thinking about/remembering your schedule again? If she doesn't know that part (which to be fair she should be able to guess, but if we didn't say all the things we think our partners should just know relationships would all be doomed, and if she only knows you came home with this new rule and not the whole story then it might feel like a sudden escalation to her) then I think it's worth having a conversation about what this actually means to your day and goals and feelings and mood to see if that changes how passive aggressive her reaction has been.", "NTA - she said she'd replace them and that should have happened long before you ran out.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re expensive and she isn\u2019t replacing them. This like people eating someone else\u2019s lunch.", "NTA\n\nI'd wager she wasn't going to replace them at all and gambled on you not keeping track. She only bought a box because you called her out on it.", "Agreed. It would be one thing if she ate a few and hadn\u2019t got around to replacing them, but I feel it\u2019s a bigger deal that she ate the last one and never mentioned it to him. I would assume she knew he was going cycling if he was planning for a 200km trip. That\u2019s not a hour and done, it\u2019s presumably a bigger trip. \n\nMissing a few, not a big deal, but finding out they are all gone at 5am while getting ready to leave? She\u2019s at fault here. \n\nNTA", "I would agree with you if the bars where just a snack. \n\nBut this is FUEL for his intense workout. 200km of bicycle is not something you do with a single bottle of water and a bag of doritos. Athletes like that know their body, and they know what is working, and no, they can't substitute with anything. \n\nAlso, 1 hours in a day when you train on a long period can mean you will end your workout during the hottest part of the day. \n\nSo, no, it's not \"no big deal\". OP cannot just skip his workout, or substitute.", "On a ride as long as OP had planned, I would personally need something like a few Cliff bars to keep going. Not to keep going comfortably, but to finish the ride. That's what pushes it into NTA territory for me. Getting stuck halfway through the ride without a sufficient carb source means you're going to have a bad time", "NTA and tbh if she is that defensive about something that she knew was wrong I would take a step back and reexamine. It sounds like she is really immature and disrespectful.", "Never said it was no big deal, but she apologized, made it right, and hopefully wouldn't do it again. \n\nThis is his partner. Not some random ass roommate. If you can't trust your partner to learn from their mistakes then you're the one making one.", "They are a snack", ">She got defensive and told me that she was planning to replace them, but just hadn't gotten around to it yet. Today she came by my home office and let me know that she bought me a new box, with a sarcastic \"you're welcome\" at the end.\n\nShe didn't apologize. She got defensive, not apologetic. She even resorted to sarcasm when she replaced the bar. She clearly doesn't respect his property and all the effort OP puts into training.", "No. Maybe to you, they are. But not to an athlete, they are not \"only a snack\".\n\nThey are an important source of energy and needs to be perfectly balance. Too little fuel, you'll struggle to finish your workout. Too much, you'll feel bloated and nauseous during your whole workout.\n\nIt's not wonder athletes have strict routines. They figure it out over months and years of testing. After bad/difficult workout, they figure out what works and what doesn't work. \n\nSo no, they are not just a snack, and cannot be substituted easily.", "You're right, clearly she's a monster. OP do yourself a favor and end this relationship with her. She thinks you don't deserve personal property.", "... this is so not what anyone here is saying. No one here said that the gf was a monster. Or that OP should break up.\n\nThe question is \"AITA for telling my girlfriend she can't have my Clif Bars anymore?\". OP is not breaking up, verbally abusing his gf, or trying to get revenge. He is only removing access to some of his training necessities after she proved that she cannot be trusted to replace them... and that she took the last one without even telling OP, thus ruining his workout."]}
