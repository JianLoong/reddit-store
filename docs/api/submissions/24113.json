The issue here is actually that your girlfriend doesn't consider you when she goes about her day. You don't mind sharing these things, you mind having a consistent plan for something that sounds like a big party of your life that you reguarly can't actually do because she has made it harder. It might be she doesn't get why this is important to you beyond the bars? Like how frustrating and disappointing it is and how it's sad and stressful when you get up with your plan only to find she's put you in this position by not thinking about/remembering your schedule again?

Athletes like that know their body, and they know what is working, and no, they can't substitute with anything. \n\nAlso, 1 hours in a day when you train on a long period can mean you will end your workout during the hottest part of the day. \n\nSo, no, it's not \"no big deal\".

Too much, you'll feel bloated and nauseous during your whole workout.\n\nIt's not wonder athletes have strict routines. They figure it out over months and years of testing.

If your girlfriend loves peanut butter so much why doesn\u2019t she buy her own peanut butter flavored snacks? It\u2019s rude as shit to keep eating someone else\u2019s snacks, but especially specific snacks like work out snacks.  I had the same issue with my husband. I am a vegan and he would eat my vegan protein bars and I would be pissed because he didn\u2019t replace them. He replaced them and gave me a shitty you\u2019re welcome. I don\u2019t do passive aggressive cause I\u2019m a grown up so I just ignored him. She wasn\u2019t going to replace them and when you did buy more she was going to just keeping eating them.

She was then sarcastic about it, which means she bought them to placate, not because it was the right thing, and thought you were out of line. In essence, she lacks humility to recognize when she's in the wrong, and the grace to be polite about it. I really hope that's just immaturity on her part and not her personality as a rule.", "You let her know what was acceptable, she didn\u2019t forget once she forgot every flipping time she took one and didn\u2019t replace it. Her sarcastic tone is amazingly disrespectful, it isn\u2019t about the stupid bar it\u2019s about you planning ahead and her being too lazy to make you whole again/supporting your self care. If you allow her to minimize this, she\u2019s going to do crappy stuff and KNOW she can get away with it. I\u2019ve been through this with lemon lina bars, he took a lot more from me and called it \u201cfair\u201d because he got his.

She should have provided an apology with that box of Clif bars.", "NTA, \n\nIn college, my roommate and I had a great relationship with food sharing- we shared the basics like oils and spices, and each had our own food. For things we bought a lot of -frozen pizza, yogurt- the other person could take one, but never the last one and would replace it before it would be missed. So, if on a Tuesday I took a frozen pizza and there were 6 left, I knew I could replace it on Saturday, but if it was the last one, I needed to ask AND replace it the next day. \n\nYour girlfriend clearly took the last of an item, and sure, she had every intention of replacing it, but on HER schedule, not yours. That means she isn't a good person to share food with, because you have very scheduled food, and she isn't amenable to being that vigilant. That doesn't make her the worst person ever, of course, but it is appropriate for you to limit what you share if it negatively impacts you.", "NTA. They are yours. You explained you would share, IF she replaced them. She should not have taken the last few of she had not replaced them yet!", "NTA Nothing is worse than trying to be prepared and having someone else actively prevent or undo your work. Yes it just clif bars, but when you needed them the stores weren't even open. She hadn't been replacing them so it's as if you were unprepared.", "NTA. She ate them and didn\u2019t replace them in a timely manner. The worst part to me is she ate the last one and didn\u2019t mention it or replace it. That is f@cking rude.", "NTA. An unspoken rule is not to take the very last item, especially if you're supposed to replace it. At the very very least, she should have told you she took the last one so that you would know.", "NTA!\n\nShe sounds petty.

My husband and I don\u2019t mess with each other\u2019s workout fuel.", "NTA. i keep a case of energy drinks so i can have one before i workout. i also workout very early like you so yes i would be angry if someone took my last one and i was up at 4am unable to replace.", "NTA. Your friends and family are technically correct but absolutely missing the point - it's not a problem if she eats *some* of your bars...but she didn't do that. She ate *all* of them without replacing them, leaving you without supplies for a 200km cycle trip. That could have been dangerous.\n\nI think they're also missing the point that for your girlfriend they're cool snacks, but for you, they're essential fuel.", "NTA. \u201cDon\u2019t eat the last of someone\u2019s X\u201d unless you can replace it immediately is literally roommate 101.", "This is a minor red flag on her end. Agrees to a stipulation for using something of yours, ignore the stipulation, assumes the mantle of the one who was wronged, then gets an attitude over doing what she said she would do in the first place? Maybe not red. But \u2026 burnt Orange or something, I dunno. This deserves a talk with her at least. NTA.", "NTA it\u2019s a boundary and she\u2019s crossed it on purpose.

Now I don\u2019t have to worry if she\u2019ll have one for a school or try to find something else to eat for the gym. \n\nYou were kind to share.

I like the energy when my stomach can\u2019t handle coffee or soda. Am I completely missing the point of them?", "NTA, she can buy her own. It\u2019s also common sense to never take the last one of someone else\u2019s food, even if you plan to replace it", "Any time my partner and I buy snacks I ask if he\u2019s gonna want anything and he says no, and eventually started buying some in case because he always ends up wanting just \u2018some\u2019 but eating majority of it \ud83d\ude44", "Nta - she\u2019s stealing your food", "NTA.  I\u2019m guessing your family, and anyone who thinks you are the AH does not do any type of long distance endurance training and does not understand how critical it is to need your food and drinks while out, and that you can\u2019t just always switch it up to anything else you have handy.  Nor, have they tracked food and felt first hand the frustration when someone takes said food and you have to start over.  Unless you\u2019ve done it, it can be hard to understand, but regardless you DID tell her they need to replace it doesn\u2019t matter.  If it was your leftovers, or a piece of dessert you were saving would they have still said you\u2019re the A H?", "NTA. To ride the distances you're doing these are necessary. People who aren't into sports don't necessarily realise that when you're exerting yourself to the extreme, your body can't cope with complex things to eat and so these kind of energy bars are designed to be easily digested whilst your body is under duress. Both me and my ex were heavily into sports, albeit different ones, but neither of us would take the others preferred nutrition and if either of us saw the other was getting low we'd mention it to make sure the other didn't get caught out.\n\nThese kind of energy bars are not exactly cheap either. Hopefully by buying you a new box your girlfriend will now know that. I think she's been a bit of an AH for being passive aggressive about replacing them. They are not casual chocolate bars and she should learn to view them as the thing that helps you deal with 100k long bike rides. She needs to be more considerate of you in this area.", "Wait, who cooks rice cakes?", "NTA - its a small thing but it sounds like it effects your schedule regardless. also if she likes peanut butter she can just eat peanut butter. i don't think its asking that much to ask her to be more considerate and either replace the bars and or don't eat the last one. she's the one making a mountain outta a mole hill", "NTA", "You were late one day and then she replaced them when asked (even if it was sarcastically).

You two are back at equilibrium now.\n\nBut NTA because she should have replaced them earlier.", "NTA \nI don\u2019t necessarily think either of you are tbh. It sounds like she was genuinely going to replace them but either forgot or put it off until the next day. \n\nHowever, she could have been more considerate of your workout routine and why they were so important to you. Maybe speak to her and let her know you\u2019re not angry at her. It\u2019s up to you to you if you let her continue getting some but I think she\u2019ll be more considerate about replacing them now that she\u2019s more aware.", "NTA\n\nShe can now buy her own.

Done.\n\nAlso, i dont know where you live that you cant get a snack at 5am.

If thats your roomate then yeah NTA BUT SHE IS UR GF YOU GUYS ARE LIVING TOGETHER. SHE PROBABLY DIDNT KNOW. Its just food and IM SURE YOU EAT HER STUFF AS WELL. Its not logical to immediately replace food as soon as you eat them, normal people replaces food the next time they go gorcery shopping. Yes I understand you use it as fuel but she probably didnt know you eat them every single day/ it was important to replace then right away. You guys probably have ALOT of other options at home so her reasoning was probably that \u201cI will pick up some next time i go to the grocery store since there are other stuff in the house\u201d \n\nLook if you plan to be a family with her stop being so petty and anal about whats mine is mine and whats urs is urs. Because let me tell you if you draw the line so clean down to a fucken cliff bar then she doesnt have to do anything for u as well because spending life with soneone is not always gonna be equal. These tit-for-tat relationships are so exhasting, you are starting an exhasting tally mark relationship.", "Honestly, ESH. \n\nShe should not have taken the last one without letting you know. That was very inconsiderate. However, telling her she can't have them anymore is also very childish. Not to mention, why did you not check you were all set the day before?! She returned the same petty energy you gave her. Approaching her and sharing what had happened and how it threw things off for you may have warranted a more apologetic response off the bat. \n\nYou knew she grew to like them, why not just always make sure to have some extra on hand? Or maybe keep some set aside that you use specifically for your workouts? \n\nAlso, keep in mind that in long term partnerships, silly things/miscommunications like this will happen.
