YTA. Your son was throwing up and your solution was \u201cchamomile tea\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t keep meds\u201d. It sounds like he wanted the benefits of modern medicine and taking his aunt\u2019s pill (she didn\u2019t mind) was the only way to get it.

The one line about not keeping meds in the house is worrying, as is that your first reaction to a bad headache was tea. You have intentionally avoided mentioning what the pill was, and assuming it was something like paracetomol or ibuprofen, the more telling thing is that your kid felt like he had to steal something like that to get relief from his pain over any other option.\n\nBehaviour like this doesn't happen in a vacuum, and that you don't keep basic medication in the house makes me think something in your attitude towards medication has caused your son to come to the conclusion that stealing it from someone is easier than just asking you for some.", "YTA.\n\nYou are not TA for reprimanding George or grounding him for taking your aunt's pills, ~~which are presumably prescription medication~~ \\[UPDATE: they weren't. They were OTC. See below.\\]\n\nIt is a terrible idea to steal someone else's meds, especially when he's only 13, probably doesn't even know what they're for (they're not necessarily painkillers), and almost certainly has no idea of what the contraindications or side effects might be. You don't say whether you impressed upon him how dangerous that is.\n\nAll you said was you are \"*disappointed in him for taking something as important as medication without asking for permission first*\". If that's **all** you said - i.e. the only reason you're mad is that he didn't ask permission - then that's weak as piss, and you get an asshole point for that.\n\nBut you get an even bigger asshole point **for creating a situation where he needed some pain relief and you provided nothing he could safely use**.\n\nYou said \"*we don't keep meds in the house*\". Why the fuck not? You should have OTC meds in the house, such as a mild painkiller for headaches. All you gave him was chamomile tea. Poor kid, it obviously wasn't effective enough, and he had nothing else. He was probably desperate for some relief. What he did was wrong and very unwise, but you created the situation where he felt he had no choice. Take responsibility for that. Go buy a packet of Tylenol, FFS.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: When I wrote the above comment, OP had not yet said what type of medication it was.

Unfortunately, this could lead to him thinking it's OK to just take people's pill and surely do not want to go down that road .  He needs to know it is a big deal.
