My sister said it's just one pill and not a big deal; however, I don't want my son to even get into the habit of stealing something as important as medication and just 3 days grounded/no video games is nothing in the big scheme of things.

YTA. Your son was throwing up and your solution was \u201cchamomile tea\u201d because \u201cwe don\u2019t keep meds\u201d. It sounds like he wanted the benefits of modern medicine and taking his aunt\u2019s pill (she didn\u2019t mind) was the only way to get it. He doesn\u2019t agree with your values and that seems to be what you\u2019re really punishing him for not \u201ctheft\u201d.", "Question: why do you not have any medication in your house?", "Maybe get rid of the folk-remedies and keep some actual medication in your house. No wonder your kid went looking elsewhere; what you supply is no help to anyone. YTA.\n\nYou sound like the kind of loving mother who's going to have a melt-down when you learn he went behind your back to get himself vaccinated.", "YTA. The one line about not keeping meds in the house is worrying, as is that your first reaction to a bad headache was tea. You have intentionally avoided mentioning what the pill was, and assuming it was something like paracetomol or ibuprofen, the more telling thing is that your kid felt like he had to steal something like that to get relief from his pain over any other option.\n\nBehaviour like this doesn't happen in a vacuum, and that you don't keep basic medication in the house makes me think something in your attitude towards medication has caused your son to come to the conclusion that stealing it from someone is easier than just asking you for some.", "YTA.\n\nYou are not TA for reprimanding George or grounding him for taking your aunt's pills, which are presumably prescription medication. It is a terrible idea to steal someone else's meds, especially when he's only 13, probably doesn't even know what they're for (they're not necessarily painkillers), and almost certainly has no idea of what the contraindications or side effects might be. You don't say whether you impressed upon him how dangerous that is.\n\nAll you said was you are \"*disappointed in him for taking something as important as medication without asking for permission first*\". If that's **all** you said - i.e. the only reason you're mad is that he didn't ask permission - then that's weak as piss, and you get an asshole point for that. \n\nYou get a second asshole point **for creating a situation where he needed some pain relief and you provided nothing he could safely use**. \n\nYou said \"*we don't keep meds in the house*\". Why the fuck not? You should have OTC meds in the house, such as a mild painkiller for headaches. All you gave him was chamomile tea. Poor kid, it obviously wasn't effective enough, and he had nothing else. He was probably desperate for some relief. What he did was wrong and very unwise, but you created the situation where he felt he had no choice. Take responsibility for that. Go buy a packet of Tylenol, FFS.", "Info: what kind of \u201cpill\u201d \u2014 otc, prescription? If prescription, what kind? Is there otc medication in the house? Chamomile tea doesn\u2019t really do anything for a \u201cbad headache,\u201d does he get these often?", "Yta - you've put your kid in a position where he has to steal because he can't get necessary medication. \nAn over the counter medication: Tylenol, paracetamol ibuprofen etc is not even stealing. It's something that should be freely available and offered. If your kid had asked his aunt she would have (should have) said yes without hesitation. He couldn't ask because of you.\nYour son didn't steal prescription medication, that would have been different.\nLots of people keep over the counter meds in bathroom cabinets so people can help themselves.\nYou're also medically neglectful by denying your kids proper medical care.", "YTA.You don\u2019t keep meds in the house?Where I live your children can legally go to the doctor on their own, and get prescriptions for meds.Yet you won\u2019t even let them have a Tylenol and they feel compelled to steal/borrow it from your sister?\n\nMan\u2026 these \u2018kids\u2019 are going to grow up fast and move out the day they can.

I also don\u2019t know the extent of how you might excuse your kids away from company. The language you used makes me feel like they can\u2019t go to you when they might need you. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards YTA because your kid wanted relief. Stealing was a byproduct of a situation wherein your child wasn\u2019t receiving the attention or care they needed. \n\nMaybe your child was really suffering. Why didn\u2019t you, personally, check in on them? \n\nYour punishment isn\u2019t harsh but who cares. You punished a kid who was seemingly desperate for help. \n\nBehaviors exist for a reason. This kid sounded like they were desperate for relief. So they did what they needed to do. \n\nIf stealing medication becomes a habit then you have a problem. Right now it seems like you should probably have a more respectful and trustworthy relationship with your child so they don\u2019t resort to desperate situations again.", "INFO: What was the medication?", "INFO: What was chamomile tea supposed to do for his headache? And what do you mean you don't keep \"meds\" in the house? Do you not believe in them or something?", "YTA\n\nSo you're failing to provide your kids with adequate healthcare, and want to punish your child for taking care of themself? Tea ain't doing shit for a migraine. There is no reason that your kid should be *throwing up* from pain under your care. You're failing as a parent. Do better.", "YTA\n\nI kinda understand not having medication on the house, but the minute your child is suffering you should get out of the house and buy some OTC tylenol at minimum. A chamomile tea will not work into decreasing a headache so strong as to cause a child to puke.\n\nThat said, I'm left wondering here if you trying to adress a medical issue with your children with a tea instead of medicine is something new, or if this was the first time your ignored your children's suffering in lieu of your own convictions.\n\nYes, it's not OK for your children to steal, but if you aren't taking care of them properly, they are not the ones to be blamed on.", "YTA WTF get some meds", "Wow, \n\ni don\u2019t even know where to start. You are not keeping medication at Home ?\n\nlet me tell you , as someone with real migraines, just reading this make me so angry.\n\nibuprofen is the only thing that works for me, otherwise I will find myself shaking in the dark trying not to throw up.\n\nThat your son is throwing up tells me he is in the same team and in can\u2019t believe you gave him chamomille tea and let him suffer as if pain was a magical cleanser.

Especially, if it was prescribed to her.", "INFO: It depends\u2026 is this a Tylenol or a narcotic we\u2019re talking about?

Like duh, taking anything without permission is bad. But taking PILLS without permission? That\u2019s scary. \n\nThat being said, I make that judgement with some trepidation\u2026I do question why your son had no other option than chamomile presented to him for a \u201cbad\u201d headache. It sounds like chamomile tea wasn\u2019t going to cut it and he felt he needed something stronger. I\u2019d be interested to know what medication he stole from your sister (Tylenol, Motrin, aspirin, opiates, something else) because I think context matters here. If it was something more innocuous like an OTC NSAID I\u2019d be more concerned as to why he felt he *needed* to steal it. If it was something harder like OxyContin or Percocet, that\u2019s a different conversation. \n\nIf you\u2019re not providing him with safe options for pain relief outside of tea, YTA.

Your position on not keeping meds in the house is worrying, but taking medicine from another person without permission is nevertheless extremely uncool, and you have managed to keep the focus on the theft without veering into antimedical nonsense.\n\nNevertheless, I am forced to question who you don't have some basic headache medicine on hand.", "NTA.\n\nDon\u2019t take medication that might make you sick and deprive the prescriptee of their drugs.\n\nThis is a lesson he needs to learn.", "STEALING EVEN ONE PRESCRIPTION PILL IS A CRIME. Better nip that one at the bud. And people, you need to hide narcotics from your kids because we are all idiots at that age. \n\nI hid my narcotics from a visiting nephew based on intuition.

This should be a big talking point for both kids about taking any type of medication without getting approval or at the very least asking if it one can take it.  Taking pills could be deadly if he takes the wrong ones.  I strongly recommend you sit with him and talk about why he shouldn't have taken the medicine.  Unfortunately, this could lead to him thinking it's OK to just take people's pill and surely do not want to go down that road .  He needs to know it is a big deal.  Aunt needs to zip it and let you parent your child. Seems like it may not be the first time he's taken aunties meds or she's given it to him w/o you knowledge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
