No, she is being unreasonable. NTA. I am honestly mad at her reaction.", "NTA. Your child comes first. End of story:", "NTA\nYou offered several options for pickup. That is fair. Your own kid takes priority and you didnt say you wouldnt help at all, you just wont be able to help as much as you thought you would. Your mother needs to try to make some other arrangements.", "NTA. Your mom is being unreasonable & selfish. There is only so much of you to go around. And your kids should always take precedence over anything else. Can't your mom hire in-home care for your dad? Would their insurance cover it?", "NTA.  You're placing your priorities exactly where they belong: on caring for your children.\n\nIt might help to arrange alternative transport for your mother and father and to arrange for someone to go help them (from their Church, maybe?). But job number 1 has to be caring for your child.", "NTA. The timing of all this is unfortunate. You would have been there if you could be. Maybe committing to caring for him every day was a bit of a stretch in the first place, even if your child hadn't gotten injured. That was a lot of her to ask of you, especially with an hour commute each way. What would she do if you were delayed in traffic, or if one of your kids got sick? That is what she needs to do now. I'm sure she's upset about his health and overwhelmed with it all, but you do have to put your own kids first.", "NTA, your mom is.", "You are not the AH. You clearly care/love your parents and I think when you said \u201cmy kids come first\u201d you meant it as, the kids can\u2019t take care of themselves while your parents are adults. Therefore you have to help them first. That might have hurt their feelings. Plus you offered to pick your dad up and help out. Just not in the way they wanted.", "NTA \n\nWould she have agreed to that with her parents when she was raising you?", "NTA This was completely unexpected, but I do have to ask where your partner is in this equation? Certainly, they can watch the kids? If there's no partner in the picture, though, it's completely understandable.", "INFO -- is your mother health-compromised in any way that would render her incapable of caring for him by herself? Why is it she asked for help?", "NTA. She can\u2019t honestly expect you to juggle your dad on top of the kids. You maybe could have picked him up from the hospital because your 10 year can probably be left alone for like 3 hours, but certainly not every single day! That\u2019s absurd!", "NTA\n\nYou did break Alex's leg, right? So what are you supposed to do? You're ONE person. \n\nBut is Alex's father involved in his life? If so, reach out to him, to help with Alex?", "INFO: When did you tell your mom yoi wouldn't be able to help? Your post makes it sound like you told her today, and it seems like you should have known for a week, if not two that you were going to be unable to help. Your kids definitely should be your priority,  but did you give your mom adequate time to look for other solutions?", "NAH.  I understand that you need to prioritize your own kids, but I also understand your mom's panic.  This was a major, and probably terrifying, life event for her and your father, and she's desperately trying to juggle, and she thought she had this covered, and now at the last moment, suddenly she doesn't.  What she said was unkind, but this is probably one of the lowest moments in her life, and nobody is at their best when they are chronically exhausted and terrified.  She needs home healthcare for your father, and hospitals often have advocates who can help find resources for that, but they need time.  It would have been helpful to let her know earlier that your own life crisis was going to cause problems with the original caretaking plan, but I'm sure you were absorbed in your own issues too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your children come first.", "NTA... you do have your hands full.", "NTA\n\nYour kids are your priority and I'm guessing that looking after an infant and an injured kid is probably a lot harder than you might've expected when it first happened.\n\nYour dad has been in hospital for two weeks... what sort of relationship do you have with your parents?  Did your mother not realise how difficult it is at your place at the moment.  And adding another sick person to your plate is too much.\n\nAt minimum she can take the day off to pick him up.  How much care will he actually need?  How much does she do for him when he's not unwell.  Some people expect their partners to do all the cooking and all the housework even if they work, while they supervise.  If they are unwell they will expect more ie feed me.  Is that what your dad is like or is he fairly independent?\n\nYour mom is only at work for 5 hours a day.  If it's a short commute, then that's 5.5 hours away from him.  If he's stable and has everything set up for him so he can reach it, then he should be fine.  He's an adult so should be able to manage as opposed to expecting a 10 year old child to do this.  Is there a neighbour who he can call on if he needed something while your mom was at work?\n\nDo you have siblings?  If you do, can they help out?\n\nYour dad should be pretty stable and doing well before being discharged from hospital.

Did you let your mom Know in advance after your son broke his leg, you would no longer be able to help her with your dad? Because if you waited till night before to tell her you can't help, then you'd be a jerk for that. But if you if you informed her right after your son got hurt and didn't wait till last minute I'd  say your NTA.", "Mum should pay for a temporary carer.", "Plus her mom should realize this as well.

I\u2019m sure it would be helpful to have both her and her mom on that task. \n\nBut it\u2019s not at all reasonable for OP\u2019s husband to take his PTO for so OP can do the long-term care. Nope. Why on earth should he do that, when her mother could take time off from her job?", "Because she works! so, she cannot or doesn't want to take time off to care for her husband, but guilt trips OP for being unable to come every day with 1 sick and 1 very young kids.\n\nBTW, INFO: why mom doesn't take her PTO to take care of family member?", "My mom works every day except the weekends. She has no health concerns", "You think it is appropriate to leave a 10 year old at home alone? Particularly with a broken leg?", "Except for if the 3 hours turns into 5 or more thanks to traffic or just delays at the hospital.  It's not like the OP is 10 mins away if there is an issue..  \n\nIt may be possible to get a neighbour (or Alex can stay with a neighbour) but they may also be at work.", "Why should that fall to her husband? Her mom can take time off to help her dad. That should be the end of the discussion.", "Unfortunately my husband can't take anymore days off at the moment.", "So where was Grandma in the last two weeks since Alex broke his leg?  It wouldn't take much to know that he can't tolerate long car rides as it's common sense to know it would be uncomfortable.\n\nGrandma had ample time and at the very least, she perhaps should've looked at a plan B once the leg was broken...  Kid had to go for surgery so it was a more complicated break.  The injury is still pretty recent.  Kid's going to be in a cast for at least another 4 weeks if not longer.", "I think the best solution could've been having husband take off if you really wanted to help your parents. Plus, now that your sons leg is broken, he should take a day off or let you go on the weekend to help your parents. If not for that reason, at least you can get some other important things done as well that you'd usually have more time to allocate to. For example, if you have anything for you, 6 mo old, any doctors appointments, and personal errands for either you or your husband. He'll need to take off if the 10yr old is in a cast still.\n\nIn any case, these things do happen unexpectedly, but I feel the forethought should've been to have your husband on standby. An hour commute both ways, and the time in between getting your father inside and comfortable should've already merited an ask for his help. That's 3+ hours out of the house with a 10 yr old and a 6 (?)  it would've been much easier to have them stay home with dad.\n\nRegardless, just take this opportunity to as a need to ask for help. Yes, this is an unfortunate accident before an important commitment had to be compromised, but honestly even if he didn't break his leg it just seemed like an impossible ask to begin with.", "I'm not sure.", "Thank you for your enthusiasm, but I really was asking OP as it is relevant.   \n\n\nThe namecalling from the mom was over the line, but I'm also taking into account that this woman just had an extreme life or death scare out of the blue. She sounds stressed, overwhelmed, and trying to pin down ways to manage her suddenly delicate husband and an extreme lifestyle change. Recruiting OP probably helped alleviate that stress, and then that was yanked out from under her too. Of course she reacted poorly. Is it an excuse? No. Does it deserve compassion? Probably, which is why I'm info-seeking before making a judgment call.", "If that's the case, and she can get PTO, then yes, NTA. Your adult child is not obligated to be your caretaker and more parents need to remember this. You are also not obligated to tolerate verbal abuse no matter how overwhelmed your mother is.  \n\n\nI think the only thing I'd gently suggest is that because she does sound so overwhelmed, you might consider offering to help her track down some numbers for some at-home services. I think she's equating your lack of availability with a lack of compassion for your dad, which isn't the case. You just have too much on your plate. Offering to help her find alternatives might be a kind gesture.", "For a few hours, I think it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m imagining if mom was say running weekend errands (bank, grocery store, dry cleaners, mechanic). That could take a few hours and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to try to drag a kid with a broken leg along with, so he might be home for those few hours by himself. With crutches, he\u2019s likely able to get between the couch, bathroom and kitchen for snacks/water without a probable major incident. \n\nEvery day though? No.", "True. I was giving it an extra hour, but yes, that could easily balloon to even greater lengths.", "Darn. If you are in the US, FMLA is something that can be looked at. If it comes to that. Sorry you're stretched like that. That's too much for anyone to safely juggle.", "If someone is going to take off work to help care for OP\u2019s father, it should be OP\u2019s mother. She works part-time (vs full-time for OP\u2019s husband), she lives with the patient (vs two-hour round-trip commute), and she has more responsibility to her own husband than OP\u2019s husband does to his father-in-law.", "Unfortunately my husband used up most of his PTO to help me with Alex. He took 4 days off to take Alex to camp, 3 days for different school events, and then he took a week off to help before and after Alex's surgery. He only has 2 days of pto left for the year that he's keeping in case something else happens. He only has 5 sick days for the year that he's already planning on using for doctors appointments. \n\nWe can't afford for him to take unpaid time off at the moment.", "FMLA only covers if the employer has 50 or more employees. And even if it covers, the leave is unpaid.", "Is FMLA leave available for either him or your mother? Both should be eligible. Assuming you are in the US, based on your grammar.", "Unlike PTO, FMLA is unpaid."]}
