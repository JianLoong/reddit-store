He scratches and hits anyone who in near so hard it leaves marks/bleeds.\n\nWe moved out after buying our own place a few months later and he brought up his plan to have him move in with us once his parents reach an age where they can not take care of him anymore or can not afford to pay the care staff that come over. That is honestly not too far in the future. He does not trust care homes at all and doesn't even like the workers that come to look after him.

This isn't something small that just pops up. He had it planned already and knew you wouldn't be comfortable with it.", "YWNBTA - Run.  Run fast, run far, run hard.  The rest of your life will be a living hell if you don't.  You can't risk exposing little ones to this.", "NTA, but I think your husband kind of is for not being clear about the care his brother requires. I don\u2019t see it as a matter of \u2018making sacrifices\u2019 because you love him\u2026 I see it as being something that may well end your marriage if you can\u2019t get on the same page - and soon!\n\nWere I in your shoes, I would put any baby plans on hold for now until you can come to some type of agreement. It\u2019s hard not to believe your husband was intentionally hiding/vague about his plans before you married. I\u2019d be pretty livid.", "NTA\n\nHis brother is a danger to himself and others. He is currently NOT being cared for properly if he is left to bang the walls and floors and climb on top of furniture and is able to injure people! He needs to be moved to a facility where they can properly care for him.\n\nUnder no circumstances should you agree to let the brother move in, not even for 'just until he can move to a home', not even for 'just for the next couple of weeks'. You don't know this man. You were kept away from him. You do know he is violent (possibly not deliberately, but his actions have caused injury to others and himself), unpredictable, and very loud at all hours of the day. There is no way to live with someone like that let alone plan to be pregnant and have children in the same home.\n\nDO NOT GET PREGNANT RIGHT NOW.\n\nYou need to figure out if your husband is willing to help his parents find a permanent facility for the brother to move to (the local council or healthcare provider can help find the right paths, or adult services, etc), or if your husband will try to grate you down and pressure you to accept the brother moving into your home.\n\nIf it were me I would divorce someone if he insists on moving his severely disabled, loud, and aggressive/physical brother into the home he shares with me, and that we intend to start a family in.\n\nSomeone like that is NOT safe to be around if you are pregnant, have just given birth, are breastfeeding, and have (young) children.\n\nIf your husband wants to tie his future to living with his brother to care for him, good for him, but you need to let him know NOW that you will not be part of it and will not be there for it.\n\nBetter find out in the next 6 months what your husband's decision is going to be (A: try everything possible to find a facility for the brother; or B: keep pushing to move the brother into your home) and if you can not accept his choice, LEAVE.\n\nYou want children. Don't waste your time on someone who has a vastly different future plan than you do. I don't know your cultural background but I am willing to bet that if the brother would move in, you would be expected to do at least 50% of all the care, if not closer to 99%. And that care is not just any extra laundry the brother may create from just being a third person in the house, it is also extra laundry if he soils himself or spills food, throws up regularly, needs to be washed more often etc. It's not just the extra meals you will need to cook, possibly feed him, and clean up after he's thrown it on the wall or off the table. It's not just the shouting and banging all day long you will need to deal with. What about his toileting needs and shower needs? Could you even lift him? Would you need to spend thousands installing special lifts in the house to move him around? Is he mobile? Would he even accept being bathed or toileted by you? Do you even want to do that? Who is going to entertain him all day? What if your husband wants to see his family and they want to do something the brother can't be part of, I bet you will be asked to 'babysit'. What about if YOU want to go away for the day or a weekend or even a week to see your own friends or family, will you be told no, that you are needed at home to help with the brother? Even if you wanted to do all this, you wouldn't be able to have kids. You just wouldn't have the time and energy  for it. What if you were to have kids and need a cesarean, and you need at least 4 weeks bedrest if not more. Is your husband going to do 100% of the care for his brother, do all the house work, and do the care for you? Or are you going to be expected to be up and running again in a week to care for the brother? Nope out of this right now. Draw the line in the sand and don't bend an inch on this. Yes do agree to some finances going towards the brother's care, but ONLY if he lives in a facility or with other family (if they volunteer to take him in, of course you can help out financially). But under no circumstances accept the brother to move in. You could be wasting your 30s on this to try and make it work to still end up divorced but now you are 37 and need to start from scratch again and that's going to be hard if you want to meet a new person to have kids with.", "Hmm NTA; I think you need to sit down and seriously think \u201ccan I have the life I want and kids with my BIL living here\u201d, and seriously sit on it, and problem solve, and write down any pros, cons and any serious issues and anythibg that can be mitigated, and what can\u2019t.\n\nAnd ultimately, if the answer is that you can\u2019t have the life you envisioned, you need to have an open dialogue with your husband about your feelings, which may be hard, and if you dont see eye to eye, you may not be husband and wife afterwards.", "Your in-laws are very much aware of how extreme your brother-in-laws behavior is.  That is why they hid him until you were married.  Were your parents aware of BIL and the plans for him to live with you when they arranged the marriage?  I read your other posts about your husband and his family prioritizing their desires over yours.  I don't think that you are wrong for not wanting the BIL living with you, but I suspect that your desires will not matter to your in-laws.  You might want to postpone starting a family until you see if it will be safe with BIL around.  Good luck. \n\n NTA", "NTA get marriage counseling now and DO NOT have children until you resolve this issue. You probably would be better off getting a divorce than trying to change your husbands mind. There is a reason they never let you meet him until right before the wedding. Just because your husband wants to sacrifice his life caring for his brother doesn\u2019t mean you have to sacrifice yours as well.", "NTA. You have a say in this. He shouldn\u2019t have made this decision without you.", "NTA but you two are not on the same page and you should not start a family right now.", "NTA at all.  They fooled you. \n\n He would be dangerous to have around children. \nWould you be expected to be the full time carer?    Has your husband ever actually seen any care places?  \nIt's natural and lovely that they care about him so much, but not at your expense.   Make this a firm no  and good luck.", "NTA. You will be the one taking care of him, house, and kids. Put your foot down. Tell him if his brother moves in you will be moving out and taking the kids and he will be taking care of his brother.", "NTA - this would be an absolute dealbreaker for me as this was a clear attempt to spring this on you after the wedding and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was all agreed between your husband and his parents before y\u2019all got serious tbh.\n\nPlease don\u2019t start a family until you can be sure that you are both on the same page.", "NTA and you need to make it crystal clear to your husband that brother will NOT be moving in. It sounds like he needs more care than you can provide and is a danger to others. Start looking for group homes now so your husband can find one he approves of.", "An additional thought...Do you know the nature of your BIL's condition ?  Is this an inherited medical condition ?", "No, his brother does have options - your husband just doesn't like them.  First, you, nor your husband have the proper training to handle him, nor the proper environment to keep him safe.  To date, the brother is kept in a room like a dirty secret and when he's not, he's disruptive.  This is not a safe environment for kids, nor is it sustainable. His brother deserves to have a place where he will get the proper care and opportunity to flourish - not just exist in a place not equipped to give him adequate / basic quality of life.  Research some homes, and do some tours - your husband may quickly see that these places can offer him more than your home could.", "NTA-\nThat's an awful situation he's in but that doesn't excuse him hiding this from you until you're locked into a marriage with him.\n \n\nI'd make a list of every behavior of his brother's that is concerning for you and why each is a concern (financial, damage to the home, harm to himself or others especially future children, the burden of care- is he planning on being the 24/7 caretaker, because you certainly shouldn't be).\n\n\nYour husband should go down your list and detail out exactly how he plans to address every single concern. No plan? The brother doesn't move in. The plan doesn't adequately address the concerns? Brother doesn't move in. It was very manipulative of him to hide this, and if he isn't willing to have proper discussion to make sure that you also feel safe and secure in your home- then you should leave", "So it was a bait and switch. Let's hide the brother until you've married your husband. And then spring on you that a very disabled person will be moving in with you. And, if you don't agree, YOU are the selfish one.\n\nYou got bamboozled. I would not have kids with this man, and I would not be agreeing to become the caregiver - which you don't seem to recognize IS the plan since he doesn't 'trust' the caregivers. Who do you think that is going to fall to? \n\nYou should be reconsidering what your options are.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your husband and his family hid the extent of his brother\u2019s condition from you until the last minute because they knew that you wouldn\u2019t agree to take on his care, or honestly sound alike way too much for non-professionals. They all lied to you. I\u2019d get divorced ASAP, especially before you have kids with him. Yikes.", "NTA. There is no way that your husband does not expect YOU to chip in and help care for his brother \u201cwhen\u201d he moves in. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he wanted you to \u201cstep up\u201d and into a major caretaker role in the future. Given all that you\u2019ve said, I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is no changing your husband\u2019s mind; you may wake up one day to find his brother already moved in with or without your permission.\n\nNow, to my knowledge at least, you neither signed up for this, wanted this, or have any training/experience to even act as a caregiver in this way. Don\u2019t wait until his brother is already there to make a decision. I have known people before who have been trapped in caretaker roles because they would feel guilty if they were to leave that person without adequate care, so it\u2019s best not to be put into that role in the first place.", "Nta he can absolutely sign up to be his brothers care taker. He *cannot* sign YOU up to be his brithers caretaker. Honestly, *this* is divorce level stuff.", "NTA at all. How old is the brother & will he be bringing his 24/7 carers to your home, & do you have enough space for them?", "Oh no. NTA. A home with his brother is not a home for small children. It\u2019s either him or children. If your husband insists on bringing him home to live with you, then that\u2019s a death sentence for having kids. \n\nYour BIL will have a place to go, there are homes for people who need help with trained professionals around.", "NTA. I'm sorry that you are in this situation.  It sounds like your husband and his family deliberately hid the severity of his brother's condition from you and that their plan has been for you and your husband to 'inherit' his care.\n\nI would applaud your husband for committing to his brother's ongoing care if he was only committing himself   Like many of the other responders to this thread, I suspect they are all planning on you being a significant member of of the caregiving team. I don't think it was fair for your husband to marry you without explaining all of this in advance. \n\nI took care of my husband's parents during their terminal illnesses, moving them into our home and being the primary caregiver. That was under circumstances including a predicted limited duration  of time and foreseeable care needs that we're in my abilities to provide. Your BIL's care sounds overwhelming and something that could be unsafe for you to even attempt if you were willing. It's okay to not be willing to undertake that. You are not a bad person because you don't want him to move into your home and dominate your life. \n\nPlease do what you can to avoid pregnancy while you figure out how best to manage this situation.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t practical for you to ever be alone with your BIL. He is definitely a danger to you and future children. It\u2019s a safety issue.", "Ask him why he chose to hide his brother until the last minute, this was all pre meditated , your husband and his family knew exactly what they were doing, not giving you the chance to say no, or to back out of it if it was something you could not see yourself taking on, so now you look like the cruel one, when In reality you were tricked into this. This is life changing and should have been a discussion between you and him way before it became part of your future plans\u2026. SO NTA, your husband and your Inlaws are though.", "NTA. But you do need to talk to your husband about what this means for your marriage. Can you see yourself living with him in the near future? Do you want future children to be hurt by his actions? You need to address this now.", "There is a reason they hid him from you.\n\nYour husband knew his brother\u2019s condition could be a deal breaker. \n\nRealistically your husband was not honest. \n\nYou need to approach this with this mindset. \n\nTell him how personally caring for his brother was not something he told you about, especially given how aggressive he is.\n\nTell him that even having children would be something that you won\u2019t be willing to do if an aggressive adult that needs major care is left on your hands. \n\nTell him you are willing to help him look for an adult care facility, but you won\u2019t be taking this responsibility.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Straight up say NO. If your husband wants to take care of him he can move back to his parents house during the week. If he moves in with you it will become YOUR responsibility to deal with him. It may end the marriage but do you want to be the babysitter for an adult man who will destroy your house.", "NTA.  You don\u2019t have to agree to this. Your in laws need to make plans for THEIR son\u2019s cRe when they are no longer able to handle it. Your BIL should have a social worker assigned to him and a plan in place. Your husband was wrong to hide this from you.", "NTA. Do NOT get pregnant. The brother would (unintentionally) kill a baby. CPS would remove any child you brought into the house with him. He is dangerous to anyone smaller than he is, pregnant women very much included. \n\nExplain the dangers to your husband. Lay it out that his brother can never live with children. Give your husband a month or two to adjust to that. Revisit it. If your husband insists that he live with you, you have some decisions to make, and you don't have a lot of time to make them if you want kids.", "GOD NO NTA. \nDon\u2019t cave on this. It will end your marriage. If you have kids your mama bear will force the decision after he hurts them", "That is a tough dilemma. If there is enough money, I would suggest having you rent a room for him nearby, where you can monitor him and check up on him daily. I know it\u2019s sucks, but sometimes you gotta make sacrifices for the ones you love, and you in-laws have been doing it for years already. Come up with a payment plan together for that and healthcare staff.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
