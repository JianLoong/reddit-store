He is demanding that you pick up a third job of housecleaning during the day.\n\nSo, it is only fair that he should share in the work after 5.  My hubby and I had a deal, 1 person cooks, the other person cleans.\n\nI suspect that he grew up in a household where his mother was a stay at home mom, so she did do all the work.\n\nYou and your husband need to have a serious objective discussion.  If he wants you to add the job of housework to your list, then something needs to come off like your call center job.  That means less income coming in for the family.  You need to talk about why he thinks you do \u201cnothing\u201d at home, did he have a SAHM when he was a kid. I am guessing that she didn\u2019t have a paid job along with the SAHM chores.\n\nHe is being unfair and you need to get him to see that he is being unfair in his assessments and comparisons.  Talk. About the details, and how would you be able to get paid for your day job and do all of the other things?", "Absolutely NTA. You're doing 2 full-time jobs during the day anyway - I don't even understand how that is possible let alone cleaning and cooking! \n\nI am on mat leave with my 6mo and my husband and I share the jobs when he finishes work because looking after a baby takes up pretty much all my time and energy during the day. I've done very well if I manage to do a load of washing and feed myself!", "NTA. You have a real job and so does he. You should split 50:50. If his commute / work schedule is hard for him to get Home to cook dinner for the kids, maybe you Can find an agreement of how to divide the chores. Sounds like he need to work on his attitude.", "Is this really even a question? Nta, which should be obvious. \n\nYou work nonstop, so does he, in that case both of you should be contributing to the house and the home. Has he ever been home while you\u2019re working? I\u2019d like to give the benefit of the doubt and suggest that maybe he just doesn\u2019t realize how much you actually work during the day, but something tells me he\u2019s of the \u201cman work, woman clean, even if she also holds a full time job\u201d mindset.\n\nEdit: jesus I completely overlooked that you also stay home with two babies all day, absolutely completely 100% NTA. I hope you\u2019re able to get a break soon, OP. :(", "Nta, obviously.  Marriage requires an equitable divide of the shared work. There are obviously some gross gender dynamics at work here and he\u2019s using \u201cyou\u2019re home all day\u201d as a pretext to demean your professional labor/foist the personal labor on you.", "NTA.   You need to remind your husband that you are his wife and mother of his children and also maintain a full time job. It doesn't matter WHERE you're working from, he can pull his weight or find someone to do as he's treating you as:  A maid.", "NTA. Why are there so many posts like this today? It is 2022 not 1952, right? Is your husband  so obtuse to not understand that you have three jobs to his one? Are the children supposed to stay quiet and you make sure you have fresh lipstick on?", "NTA\n\nIf you were non working spouse then I guess there is an argument on his side. But you both work all day and have equal responsibility.", "NTA.  You are already doing 2 full-time jobs.  call center and child care.  But he wants to do a third full-time job.  cook and clean.  WTF", "Lets rephrase it: He CAN cook, he just doesn't want to. He signed up for the marriage and parent life. He was able to cook for himself while maintaining a job before you came along. You two need to sit down and talk about equality of duties because currently, its all on you and he does not seem to respect you. \n\nNTA. You're being stretched too thin and it is not healthy.", "NTA, and very unreasonable for him to expect when you're also responsible for working a full time job AND caring for two very young kids to do everything yourself.\n\nNeeds a better conversation and deligating for shared responsibilities.", "NTA - you are at home working. I have no idea how he expects you to have dinner ready when you get off work the exact same time he does.", "NTA\n\nIf he can\u2018t cook, then he can pick up something on his way home.", "NTA!! He is the AH.  Does he not understand that you are working during the day and not a stay at home mom?  Tell him to hire someone to help with the children and cleaning.  Men are such assholes.", "NTA- You wfh and take care of the kids WHILE working. You're doing TWO full time jobs!

You just don't have to get dressed to do it:P", "NTA - Are you freaking kidding me? You are WORKING A FULL TIME JOB! And providing child care for two young children. You probably barely have time to pee never mind cooking and cleaning. Ask him how the two of you would handle child care, household tasks, and cooking if your job was outside the home? Ask him how you would handle the bills without your paycheck? Ask him who is going to cook for him when you divorce his lazy ass?", "NTA Please write a list of all of the various  household chores and childcare. Then get bluetac, an a4 piece of paper and a ruler and write out the chores down the side and days of one week on the top line. \n\nGet a couple coldies and sit down with your husband aka housemate and go through the list of chores. Agree who's going to do what when and have different colour pen for you to your husband. Write it down on the makeshift chore calendar for the week. \n\nTell him you'll both have a run through next week of how it went, swap chores around if necessary between you, but the main agmt must be 50/50. \n\nPhotocopy the chore list so that there's plenty of copies in case, as you don't want to rewrite this more than 3 times. That should be more than enough to come to an agreement on what works, from experience, on who does what.\n\nStick this on the kitchen pantry door or other very visible area, and don't do his chores, let him do them. If things aren't up to your standard, don't re-do them or take over. \n\nHousework and childcare are tasks and tasks don't have gender attached. They are simply things that need to be done to live harmoniously as adults with the freedom of not having to be living with mum and dad.  Alternatively,  no chores = regressed back to a child. Difficult to respect and be in love with an adult child.  This is how I decided to tackle this whole area with my 2nd serious relationship having been a doormat in my first and very unhappy. 2nd partner took a bit of time, but came to understand how much easier life is when you both know what's expected of you to do in the shared home, and be free to do nothing once your chores are finished. \n\nThis will help you both know where you stand and having the chores broken down this way, it won't seem off-putting to him to even know where to start when you ask for help.\n\nDon't forget, NOT on the chore list, agree romance time together like a nice movie at home, sitting on the balcony for a couple of hours together with some pizza, NO phones. \n\nYou both sound like committed, hard working and tired parents, please put the time in to do the chore list etc, it will make things less daunting for both of you as it must feel overwhelming , especially with broken sleep looking after the children.  It will help you to both pull together as a team and feel more in control. It will be hard for the first few months whilst your husband gets used to it, but men do appreciate being the solver of problems and this is a really concrete way he can help do so.\n\nGood luck OP", "NTA. I'm amazed that your husband doesn't understand that work is work. You are earning a living, and are not as free as he thinks to just roam around the house doing chores, when your ability to answer calls is what keeps you employed. So if I were you, I would just tell him that you're sorry things aren't up to his standards, but that's how it's going to be until and unless you get some help. Also - - important! - - start training your 4-year-old to help you! There are many ways to make a fun game out of it for kids. You don't want to overwhelm them, but find something that they can do reasonably well and tell them that that is their job. It might even be sorting socks or carrying plates and utensils to the sink. Something very simple that you know you can count on them to automatically do. Then when they get a little older, you add one or two chores. Kids generally like to help if it's more of a request than a demand, and makes them feel important. When your child starts doing one or two tasks, make sure your husband sees this. Anyone can contribute to the household, no matter what age or gender!\nETA: training the little one to help is not for the purpose of making up for what your husband doesn't do. It's a way of ensuring that child does not grow up into an adult who expects another adult to take care of everything. Amazing how many 18 and 21-year-olds have already formed this terrible mindset.", "NTA - I don't understand how guys can do this. I work full time, come home do all the cooking, all the cleaning, all the house upkeep... and I still have a nagging feeling that taking care of the kid is more work and my wife has it harder.", "NTA you don't stay home all day you work two jobs , i would like to see him work two jobs and make dinner every night. what a load of bull, this is why you should be really careful who you have children with", "NTA - WFH is still work. You aren't a SAHM.", "Hold the hell up. He expects you to work a full time job, and act like a sahp while he works, then does nothing the rest of the night? \n\nNo, absolutely not. You need to set him straight. \n\nNTA. Go on strike. You work all day. He's got it easy as hell.", "NTA but how do you work with a 4 yo and 7 month old? You're either making it up, neglecting your job or neglecting your children. Being a parent is hard but I don't know how that's possible", "Man needs to take some responsibility and learn to cook like an adult. Needs to help more.
