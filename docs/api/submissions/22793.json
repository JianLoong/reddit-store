I used to do 50/50 with Michelle but after her mom remarried and took her away to another state I didn't see her as often. I have had to go to court multiple times but Michelle's mother either tried to ignore or undermine my efforts to be in her life. Because of this Michelle has had some issues and whenever she sees me do something for or with Chloe she throws a huge fit and accuses me of favoritism or not really loving her as much.\n\nMichelle has admitted more than once that she was angry at me for not moving to the same state as her mom and stepdad in order to be with her, but I pointed out numerous times that I couldn't just leave because of my job and I had to stay to raise Chloe. Michelle couldn't care less about how Chloe would be effected and demanded I not talk to her at all when she would visit me in the summer.This was all a real headache for me for many years and it wasn't until Michelle's stepdad left her mom that things started to get easier for me. I had to pay for all of Michelle's moving costs in order to convince her to move back and by that time Michelle was your typical angsty teenager who was more interested in doing her own thing than hanging out with her dad. Because of this Michelle isn't as familiar with my side of the family or our culture as Chloe and a lot of them see this as her rejecting them.\n\nI've tried multiple times to bond and share with Michelle but at a certain point you just can't force things. During this past Spring my grandparents asked Chloe if she wanted to visit them in their home country before she goes to college and she was delighted. Michelle found out and was hurt that she didn't get the same offer, when I brought this up to my grandparents they said that if Michelle were to come they wouldn't turn her away but they wouldn't be paying for it like they were for Chloe and she would have to stay at a hotel or something.\n\nWhen I brought up how unfair and hurtful this looked my grandparents simply said \"if she (Michelle) can't be bothered to learn the family language then she doesn't get to use any of the family money\" and how they don't like people they barely know staying in their home. To not hurt Michelle's feelings I decided to quietly pay for Michelle's trip myself and asked Chloe not to say anything. She agree but Michelle somehow found out and is angry that I'm \"allowing\" my grandparents to treat her like this. Michelle wants me to prevent Chloe from going unless my grandparents agree to pay for her too. I didn't want to do that to Chloe so now I'm being called a terrible dad who's playing favorites. AITA?\n\nEdit to add: Okay because a few people keep bringing this up I just wanted to be clear on a few things\n\n1. Chloe was told directly by my grandparents that they would pay for her and how she could stay with them.\n2. My grandparents starting having their children young so that's why they're still alive.\n3. Neither Michelle nor Chloe's moms are from the same culture as me. Michelle's mom is White American and Chloe's mom is African-American.\n4. My grandparents fully acknowledge that as a child Michelle was blocked by her mom from learning their language, but the way they see it is that now that she's an adult she is actively choosing not to learn.\n5. Chloe's more familiar with my grandparents' language than they are with English, which is another reason why they're okay with Chloe staying at the family home and not Michelle.\n6. Michelle has consistently stated that she has no desire to learn another language because she lives in America.\n\nEdit 2: Also I would've been paying for Michelle to stay at a luxury hotel not just the flight.", "created_utc": 1689898924, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1558668/aita_for_not_keeping_one_daughter_from_an_amazing/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Michelle is a product of her environment, coupled with some teenaged driven bad decisions to not take measures to get to know your family.

It would be nice if everyone took this as a reset. Michelle could try to immerse herself in the culture and the grandparents could get to know her. Chloe should not be punished.

Your daughter has been brainwashed by a racists and instead of working to deconstruct that thought process she is being even more hateful to the half black girl that gets access to things she doesn\u2019t. \n\nIn her mind, she is better because of her proximity to whiteness so how dare your grandparents not bow down to her. She is obviously superior. \n\nI love how everyone is being so angry at the grandparents but the one thing immigrants and minorities can recognize as easy as the nose on our face is when someone is being racists. \n\nYour daughter needs help and taking something from Chloe isn\u2019t going to help. Your grandparents see things that you don\u2019t see because they are not blinded by the love of a child. They see Michelle for who she really is. She uses your guilt to punish you and Chloe. \n\nGet in therapy to get over this madness.

The rest of it is Michelle's own doing. You can't and shouldn't try to prevent your family from loving the daughter they fell in love with, even if the pricklier one gets the short end of the stick in this case. None of it's your doing anyway.", "You're not the AH but I feel really bad for Michelle. Your grandparents are being AHs. Learning a language isn't easy; not everyone has time to pick this up. Saying you won't care for someone purely because they don't know your language? Wow.", "NTA. But \u201chow\u201d did she find out about something only 4 people knew about? I doubt the grandparents brought it up before the trip. So is someone fueling the fire on purpose? I dislike that.\n\nBut Michelle could really put more effort in herself. Being lazy and entitled only gets you so far in life.", "NTA it sounds like Chloe is closer to your grandparents. It makes sense that they would invite her to stay with them. It sounds like they don\u2019t know Michelle that well and Michelle is an adult which means that she should be making her own money. It\u2019s not Michelle\u2019s fault and I understand her jealousy, but she needs to be told this.", "That\u2019s really tough and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad guy or a bad father, but somewhere between ESH/NAH. I have some similar issues as Michelle does so I kind of get where she\u2019s coming from, hopefully you\u2019ll find this helpful. So basically Michelle stopped seeing you and your family at a critical time in her life. Like you said, during the teen years she wasn\u2019t going to be interested in either parent, or even extended family much, so that wasn\u2019t really the time to try to form a bond. \n\nTo be perfectly honest, she\u2019s only barely out of that stage now so you\u2019re not going to see much improvement there. Hindsight is 20/20 and I\u2019m not trying to Monday morning quarterback your life, but from Michelle\u2019s perspective, it looks like she was moving away and you said \u201csorry, I have to think about Chloe, even if it means losing you.\u201d Which is NOT what you said and I know that, but it\u2019s how it feels to a child. So you chose Chloe, in her eyes. Then when she was a teen and pushed you away, you let her. So now, again, in her eyes, you\u2019ve chosen Chloe twice. Now your family, that Michelle was denied the chance to bond with through no fault of her own, has also chosen Chloe, and said some really awful things about Michelle. You are unwilling to take them to task again, so now we\u2019re at three times Michelle feels like you\u2019ve chosen Chloe instead of her. You are also closer to Chloe generally. So you\u2019re choosing Chloe everyday over Michelle. It appears that way to her anyway, to reiterate, I know that\u2019s not how you feel. Effectively, everyone on your side does prefer Chloe. She *is* the favorite. It\u2019s more complicated than that, but it is technically true. At the end of the day, you were the adult and she was (sort of still is) the child, the responsibility for demanding a relationship and time with her was on you, and it was on her mother to facilitate that. Both of you dropped the ball, unintentionally, but dropped nonetheless.\n\nYou meant well, and all your decisions make perfect sense, but not to a child. When she moved away you should\u2019ve visited and not let her push you away, again, hindsight. I know you didn\u2019t do it deliberately. You have to show her you telling your parents \u201cI have two daughters, not one. My family is a package deal, make an effort to get to know and love both of them for who they are or risk your relationship with me.\u201d \n\nI think you are a loving father who meant well and timing and outside forces really spiraled things for you guys, but Michelle will only resent Chloe more and risk that relationship too. For what it\u2019s worth in my own life, I tried really hard to keep a relationship with my dads family and they did a similar thing, flew my sister and brother out for a visit and didn\u2019t call me. My brother called and talked about what they were doing and asked why I didn\u2019t come. It was awkward. I hadn\u2019t been invited and I didn\u2019t know they\u2019d even gone. I stopped trying to forge that relationship. No hard feelings to most of them, but I do wish they\u2019d tried a little harder with me when I was a angsty teen. I hope you manage to find some equilibrium, all of you deserve it.\n\nEdit: I usually think this sub has pretty good takes, but the demonizing of a 20 year old girl who can\u2019t navigate complex relationship and cultural issues after a lifetime of feeling second to her sister is a certainly a choice. Not sure why the adults are all getting off the hook here. Wild.", "ESH except for Chloe. Let's begin with your grandparents. Those stipulations suck and it is not Michelle's fault. She grew up with her mother. You because I am reading a lot of excuses as to why she didn't learn your culture when she was around. You allowed her to have these views instead of addressing it. Her mother for using her as a pawn versus a child where both of you are equal parents. I truly feel sorry for Chloe as she shouldn't be caught up in the mess adults make.", "NTA- but your grandparents are. You can\u2019t punish a child for their parents (in this case Michelle\u2019s mother) choices. It\u2019s completely out of line and frankly gross.", "ESH. You for allowing the grandparents to demand she learn the language to be loved and cared for by them when they can't even be bothered to :checks hand: let her stay in the guest room or whatever they're housing Chloe. (I assume even if you paid for everything they wouldn't let her stay). What are they doing to welcome her in the family? Not the *culture*, but embrace her just even a little? I wouldn't want to learn a language for a bunch of assholes either \n\nI couldn't even imagine taking a trip to see family where they allow my sibling to stay with them but not me. I may not be \"owed anything but anyone\" but as a young person wanting family my feelings would be crushed. It sounds like it'd be a miserable trip every time I had to leave the \"real\" family and go back alone to my hotel. Good god.", "NTA.   \nNow \u2018you are favouring Michelle\u2019 and she still isn\u2019t happy.   \n\n\nYou can\u2019t tell other people how to spend their money\u2026 Michelle needs to learn this.   \n\n\nI\u2019m confused why you think YOU are the AH? Your parents have good enough reasons for their stance. You\u2019re offering to close the gap. Michelle is being an angst ridden teen here (is she still a teen?) and has been raised to be self centred. It\u2019s a shame you weren\u2019t able to be together in those formative years, but that is not something you could choose in the moment either - were you an AH for not moving interstate? No. Was her mum an AH for moving interstate? Who knows!", "NTA. Your eldest daughter is being rude", "Wow!  Your grandparents are huge assholes.  Michelle didn't ask to be brought up in another state and fail to be exposed to their language, and saying that she'd have to stay in a hotel when they're putting Chloe up is equivalent to saying she's actually not their family.\n\nMichelle also sounds selfish and jealous, but she's right this time.\n\nIf they were my kids, I think I'd have a long talk with the grandparents about how hurtful their behavior is, and if they couldn't budge, I might keep both kids from making the trip.

You gave a 17 year old ammunition for her sibling rivalry battle(s) with Michelle.

Only the parent to child direction is entitled (as in the kid is entitled to certain level of care).  All other relationships are earned.  Grands don\u2019t owe her.  \n\nMichelle didn\u2019t earn it.  Maybe you should have encouraged her to learn the language/culture with promise of taking her there as a reward.  Or, asking grands to take her if she follows through on effort.\n\nI think you\u2019re more of TA dragging down Chloe\u2019s time when she\u2019s put in the work.  May have been easier for her to due to location, but she could have easily showed no interest.", "NTA", "Plot twist- they're Ukrainian.", "NTA but I'd like to share a story that I hope Michelle ends up reading:\n\nMy great-grandfather came to the US from the Philippines just before WW2, my grandmother was born there just six months after Pearl Harbor.  \n\nMy great grandfather spoke five languages but as a little girl he only taught my grandma English, because he wanted her to be safe amid the resulting anti-Asian hysteria.  Then she was a teenager and didn't want to hang out with her dad and learn languages.  Then, at 20 years old she got married, and at 21 became a parent herself, and there was no time.  \n\nHe went back to the Philippines to die there and she would visit him, but she never felt at home, never took my mother to meet people she barely knew herself.  She's now 81 years old with grown grandchildren and she still regrets not learning while she had the chance.  I, too, regret that I will never be fluent in even basic Filipino, will likely never fulfil my dream of going with her to meet my relatives because she lost her knee and it's hard for her to travel now.  \n\nIt was not Michelle's choice to be kept from her heritage as a young child any more than it was my grandmother's, but it *is* her choice now, and it's not an option she'll have, at least as far as being taught by her family, forever.  At 20 it feels like you have all the time in the world, but that'll be gone much sooner than she thinks.  I would implore her to consider what she might regret, 60 years from now.", "NTA, but I think your grandparents are way off the mark. \n\nI'm not sure why your grandparents won't give Michelle the time of day without her learning the language. It seems like they don't view her as worthy of love without it. I just don't understand how someone can write off a person like that.\n\nIt's perfectly understandable that Michelle doesn't seem very connected with your culture given her upbringing. Even if your grandparents don't understand that, they should understand that she is your child and her worth is not based on her ability (or inclination) to learn a language.\n\nAnd if they did want her to connect with your culture and language, cutting someone off isn't the way to accomplish that AT ALL. If anything, it would make her more resentful, and because she is rejected for not being a part of the culture, it would reinforce the idea that she is not a part of it and not part of the family. She will never want to learn the language if she is actively rejected by people who could be part of the bridge to the culture. And if she doesn't feel like part of the family (which is clearly the case), why would she feel like part of the culture?\n\nI don't think Y T A for letting Chloe go, but please tell your grandparents that you will not be tolerating their treatment of Michelle any longer. That YOU will cut off your interactions with them. And please do something special with just Michelle--she is probably struggling with feeling connected to you with everything that has happened.\n\nMichelle may be an adult, but it will likely take her many years to come to terms with her upbringing, and to feel connected to this culture. Her place in the family shouldn't be based on that. \n\nI wouldn't have the time of day for anyone who treated my children like this, it wouldn't matter how they were related to me.", "NTA, if her attitude is \"I'm American, I don't have to learn another language\", then she should just stay in America.

Get over the American mentality that everyone speaks English and they have to accommodate you in their home country.", "So he should punish chloe and refuse to let her go to make Michelle happy? Why punish her to prove his love. Michelle is an adult! Chloe is 17. Most families would not pay for an adult to travel with them. They will a 17 year old.\n\nPlus it may be a moot point. Chloes mom can go to court and prove he isn\u2019t letting her go because of the other adult daughters ridiculous demands. That her daughter has a bond with the grandparents and speaks the culture.

Michelle just wants everything that is offered to chloe (even if the offer is not coming from dad) and then some, doesn't matter if she likes it or not. \n\nThe bigger problem op has is, that for the rest of their lifes michelle will whine about chloe being the golden child. Michelle doesn't sound very likable considering her character flaws, so its likely chloe will have more friends, a \"better\" partner, a better job, just a better life. Michelle on the other hand, if she stays as bitter as she is will have a hard time making true friends, finding a good partner or job, bc she will always be busy watching her sisters life like a hawk, whine about everything that looks better than what she has and feeling sorry for herself - always getting the short end of the stick from her pov.

My mom thinks it's wrong to invite, pay for, and house Chloe but not Michelle.

In his mind \"I had to learn English to be in America, she can learn X to be in Y.\"", "If the language is a major part of it though it's not exactly the same. Maybe she's disinterested and says she doesn't want to learn but it could just as easily be that she's tried and felt it was too hard or she can only say a few embarrassingly accented words and people comment / judge it. If Chloe grew up speaking the language and was just generally around it throughout her childhood, it would be much easier for her to pick it up. Little baby brains just pick it up in a way that is a much harder struggle for older brains. It's just harder. \n\nThe grand parents have been building this relationship with Chloe for several years while Michelle was denied all while wanting to be informed too. I'll bet anything when Michelle came back she got treated like a stranger or outsider constantly so of course she's withdrawn.but she clearly wants to be a part of the family. Michelle is seen as rejecting the family for the crime of being unfamiliar with people and w culture she was actively blocked from her whole life.

SHE HAD TIME. if she really wanted to learn she would have made time.", "She may be embarrassed or it could bring back memories she may not want at the forefront just feeling left out and abandoned as a kid. \n\nAnd also genuinely have many of you learned new languages as adults ? Im multilingual and speak a ton but learning a language even when i was like 14 compared to in my 20's - it is so much harder. And I always used to pick up languages quickly and easily. \n\nSo if it's already difficult or something that requires a lot from her - I can see why she's not necessarily been too overjoyed to do so. You say your family sees her not speaking the language and her unfamiliarity with your culture as her rejecting you. But literally everyone at every turn has rejected her. They're not sharing your culture with her either but faulting her for her lack of understanding and connection. No one seems to have given a rats ass to try with her at any point in her life. And to hold this against her now? It's frankly pretty sickening by your family . They are behaving deplorably", "She is not a grown adult, she\u2019s 20, she\u2019s a legal adult, developmentally she\u2019s not \u201cgrown\u201d she is *growing*. There is a difference. If you can\u2019t understand the difference between getting the opportunity to bond with someone as a young child and as a 20 year old, I can\u2019t really help you. There is a difference. It\u2019s undeniable and it\u2019s much harder when she constantly feels like she\u2019s in Chloe\u2019s shadow and like she\u2019ll never measure up. Even if she learns a language and their culture it won\u2019t be the same, because she didn\u2019t grow up in it like Chloe did. So she\u2019ll never compare to Chloe. I can imagine that puts her off, given the very long list of feelings I described that she likely experienced with regard to this particular issue. There is absolutely no excuse for what the grandparents said. That\u2019s just the truth of it. Was Michelle bratty? Sure. Did she also make mistakes? Of course, that\u2019s what teens do. Is this her fault? Absolutely not. \n\nWhat about what they\u2019re doing to try and show her they want to know her? Telling her to get a hotel? Telling her she\u2019s a stranger?

Unreal.", "So from 14-20, Michelle made little to no effort to learn more about your culture, language, or family?\n\nNope. Double nope. Put your foot down. \n\nMy kids are significantly older than their cousins and when they turned 18, I told them it was their responsibility to build & nurture their relationship with extended family. Now, they may be treated differently than their cousins, but they have fundamentally different relationships with their grandparents, aunts/uncles, cousins. Hell, my youngest sister had a baby 4 months before my daughter had a baby!! \n\nMy point is people in general, not just kids, grandkids, great grandkids, are judged according to effort put into building and maintaining relationships.

Even if she went on the trip she would probably be excluded due to the language barrier.

But at this point I'd probably rescind the offer and not put your grandparents through it, Michelle is going to be a terror on the trip.\n\nThe relationship can't be repaired of her default position is rage and she needs to talk to a therapist to deal with her internalized racism.", "NTA, but it seems like Michelle needs therapy asap. Some people say she only wants a free holiday, but if that's the case, she wouldn't complain about staying in a hotel. For me, it seems like she wants a connection to her family but doesn't know how? \"Just show some effort\" is easier said than done, especially with her background. Wanting to visit them might be her first tiny step to show some effort,  but I don't know if that's the thing you should do. I can guarantee you that your grandparents will not make her feel welcome, especially in comparison to Chloe. \nMichelle is a legal adult, but I don't blame her for not acting like one under those circumstances. She needs help and time right now.", "NTA. Michelle resented you for not moving and doesn't have a relationship with your grandparents. She's also an adult.

Michelle could not change how or where she was brought up but she could change her attitude to learning her heritage since then and has still rejected it until it became time for a holiday. Chloe has shown an interest and just as you might engage with student exchange programmes with families from cultures your child was learning about Chloe should have this opportunity regardless of whether it matches her sister's interests. Michelle is an adult, and a stranger to your grandparents, I do not blame them for not wanting to have her there as her attitude is that everyone on your side of the family owes her something. You didn't just let her mother take her, you fought for her and lost. You have been trying to make up for it  (despite it not being your fault) but honestly it doesn't sound like she is open to you winning her over at all - she is just a very angry young woman and for now she wants to stay that way. Nothing you can do or say will change that until she is ready.", "NTA", "NTA\nMichelle has a lot of emotional baggage and resentment.  Kshe needs therapy to help her heal.

She might be wise to stop trying to find it here though. It\u2019s only going to lead to heartbreak and more bad feelings it seems.", "Thank you. Looking at OPs replies I might have been too charitable with him. I want to believe the best but I\u2019m starting to think we didn\u2019t get the full story. He has a lot of excuses and non-answers for why he didn\u2019t expose Michelle to his culture and his family, why he isn\u2019t finding another way to take his grandparents to task, why he couldn\u2019t/didn\u2019t do this or that. All excuses aside, this is Michelle\u2019s culture too and when she left and when she came back, she was a child and the responsibility for teaching her about it and involving her with OPs family, was on OP. He managed it with Chloe but Michelle moved away so OP didn\u2019t bother to find a way. From the information available he effectively went \u201cwell my teen is pushing me away, I guess I\u2019ll go away then.\u201d All teens do that and it\u2019s not a reason to basically walk out of their lives. When it was pointed out that he\u2019s allowing his family to blatantly play favorites his response was \u201chow I am allowing it?\u201d Well, you\u2019re not putting in place any consequences or boundaries for mistreating Michelle. \n\nI hesitate to admit it given the bashing of a 20 year old this thread has become, but it seems like OP isn\u2019t acknowledging that he\u2019s committed any failings at all since he\u2019s been willing to pay for things. Michelle isn\u2019t asking for money, she\u2019s asking for her dad to stand up for her and not let his family treat her as less than her sister. I\u2019m a little saddened and disappointed by this comment section. I truly hope Michelle has other family.", "This is out of line. There is no evidence of racism here. Not wanting to learn a language is not racism and both Chloe and Michelle are mixed ethnicity girls.

And even if not being shared with the family back then wasn't her fault  her attitude towards it since moving back in her teens and still refusing to learn the language now at 20 certainly is. And maybe as you suggest she is finding learning the language too hard as an adult but if she is saying she just won't because she lives in America it is not up to the grandparents to figure out if she means it or if she is just embarrassed - pride comes before a fall and here the fall would be being seen to be ignorant of their culture. On top of that she is an adult who is a stranger to them - blood doesn't automatically stop people using or abusing people, especially elderly people, so the fact she shows no interest in their culture but wants the free trip makes it quite reasonable for them to be cautious.", "No, you need to check your reading comprehension skills, cuz number 6 of OPs edit clearly states \u201cMichelle has consistently stated she has no desire to learn another language because she lives in America\u201d <- you gonna pretend to be that dense?
