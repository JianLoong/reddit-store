She isn't an AH yet. But conversations about what she expects of you besides hanging out every couple weeks and what your boundaries are need to happen soon.

Your parents however are and in raising you both the way they have, have also created an AH in your sister. No siblings are joined at the hip entirely. You can be close as sisters, do things together but still have separate lives. Disability aside, I wouldn't want a sister tagging along when I'm doing stuff with MY friends. Your sister needs to find some of her own and cut out the BS otherwise she'll find herself blocked just like your parents. Sadly, this is where I see this ending for you. Stick to your guns, you've done nothing wrong, you've already put enough of your life on hold through no choice of your own, do not make anymore allowances for her. And if she starts with her BS again, block her for a period and tell her why!", "Lol. Your parents forced you to be with her all the time, forced her to be with you all the time, basically preventing both of you to have a healthy circle of friends and other interests.

Perhaps you should point out that college is a time for people to find themselves and what they'd like to do.  My sisters and I all attended the same university.  We hung out sometimes.  Most of the time, we did our separate things.  Regardless of accessibility, it would be very weird for someone's 18 year old sister to tag along all the time.", "NTA. You are allowed to live your life.", "NTA, you were essentially being groomed to be her caretaker if your parents were to die or decide it\u2019s time for you to take over full time. You are not responsible for her. Live for yourself OP. \n\nTheir words will come back to bite them.", "NAH. I have a similar situation. I\u2019m 30F. My sister (27F) is in a wheelchair. \n\nI think your parents failed both of you - you by asking you to be a caretaker and sacrifice significantly, and her by not helping her develop a healthy and independent social life. \n\nYou\u2019re at a naturally difficult juncture as siblings at your age. You should be doing more things with your own friends independently, and you don\u2019t have to cancel plans for your sister. It\u2019s also natural for her to feel left out and lonely when you\u2019re growing up and becoming more independent. It\u2019s a normal sibling dynamic, but especially heightened when the younger sibling has a disability. But demanding that you cancel your plans is unfair and it\u2019s not your job.\n\nIf I could offer one small piece of advice, it would be to make plans with your sister *in advance* sometimes on a Friday or Saturday night. This will help her feel like you still care and want to spend time with her not just when you don\u2019t have something else going on. I know for my sister it hurts to feel like she only gets attention if someone doesn\u2019t have something better to do, or if people act like their plans with her can be rescheduled all the time since she has a pretty open schedule. Planning in advance will help her feel like she\u2019s important to you still.  Hope it works out <3", "YTA.\n\nYour parents overdid it, which gave you some kind of oppositional defiant issues. Your sister shouldn't ask you to change plans to include her.\n\nBut it's not this one night. You became an adult who seems to constantly feel the need to say \"I can do whatever I want and what I want is not to hang out with losers in wheelchairs\". I don't think that your sister suddenly wants you to never do anything without her. I think she is hurt because you never want to do anything with her.\n\nYou blocked your parents just for calling you. Your behaviour is extremely resentful, your sister is better off without you in her life. Do everyone a favour and just calmly and politely say that you need some space to work through your issues.", "I have been doing that but clearly, it's not enough for her because I am not making sure she can be involved in everything. And I feel like if this is how she's going to feel about things going forward then our relationship will be as dead as mine and our parents.

I live in an apartment with friends now and she's living in a dorm.", "They'll never understand that. They will forever think I should be glad to just do things my sister can do and to make my life fully accessible to her. It's why we'll never have a good relationship.", "I would be expected to make them live their lives the way my parents made me live mine as a kid. So we'd never do anything my sister couldn't and their birthdays and our family vacations would need to be all inclusive of her.", "Yes and I made it clear I would not be, and she does not need one.", "I'm spending it with my friends/roommates this year. None of us are going \"home\" and honestly it's not home for me anymore so I'm glad to not be going.", "My sister does have friends. But she struggles socially because she doesn't like to ask them to slow down for her, or to go at her pace, but also doesn't want to have friends with disabilities. My parents never quite got her involved in groups for disabled kids and never encouraged her to make friends who were disabled and not disabled. They focused on her having not disabled friends.\n\nSo she's spending more time alone and wants to go back to the way things were when we were both at home and my parents made me make sure she could be included in everything.\n\nShe does not rely on me for transport.\n\nI also do hang out with her. I have been. But it's not enough anymore.", "Not just the family vacations, but what I could and couldn't do was limited based on what my sister could do. And my birthday parties should have been more about me than anyone. What's the point of those parties when I never got to enjoy them because there was nothing fun to do for me? At that point just tell me I can't have any since the park we used had nothing for able bodied kids to use.", "I do stuff with her. We hang out at least once every two weeks. Ever since she moved I have made time for us to hang out but I won't go back to how things were and I won't have my parents give me shit for not doing what they forced on me as a kid.\n\nI have a lot of anger at my parents. Maybe I even hate them.", "Your parents did both of you a huge disservice. You, by forcing you into a caretaker role and restricting your opportunities. Your sister, by letting her grow up with the expectation that everything should revolve around her and her needs. Does your sister attend therapy sessions? If not, it might be very helpful for her so she can learn to adjust her expectations.", "Which is absolutely reasonable. My best advice would be to encourage her to spend time with her friends and put herself out there. If there is tension between the two of you then try to keep that open contact but leave the ball in her court with how the relationship is, making it clear that you love her and are there for her but the expectations need to be realistic.", "Siblings don't do everything together. My brother is my best friend, but we still do things separately. Have separate friends, in addition to mutual. Imo the discussion with her shouldn't even be about her disability, but should be about each of your autonomy. Even if she wasn't disabled, you would do things without her. She needs to accept that you are separate people and you are going to do things without her.", "NTA\n\nI think this is something that just needs time to get past. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her an explanation for your actions so don\u2019t worry about defending yourself.  You\u2019re not responsible for managing her emotions. She\u2019ll learn to work through them\u2026or she won\u2019t. But it\u2019s not your problem", "Unfortunately, that means you and them probably will never be close.  And my guess is that they don't realize their attitude will make their dream of you taking care of her not very likely when they need you too.", "Yeah, no. I would be done if I were you. Your parents sound horrible and your sister sounds like she's the result of their upbringing. It would take some strict boundaries for me to have a relationship with them going forward. The first boundary being that you are an actual person, not a caretaker.", "It might be time to start planning your future apart from your family. You have a right to a life that is not centered on your sister and does not involve being her caretaker. That is not your responsibility. Your parents should be making plans for your sister\u2019s future and considering the options that do not burden you.", "Good for you. Merry Christmas.", "Have you tried hanging out with her and her friends? Or a group hsng out? Or is it usually just one on one. It really can't be just you. \n\nYour sister is probably only just now facing grief over her lost opportunities. That's not on you. She probably needs therapy. \n\nShe needs to be able to explain her limits to her friends not just expect you to accommodate her. She is young and if she has never done this then it's going to be hard to become the self advocate she needs to be. \n\nTry talking, ask if there is a way you could help her does not involve you being her social coordinator. Find out where she is struggling. \n\nUnless you are in an area surrounded by \"mean girls\" most people are very accommodating of physical limitations in social situations. \n\nJust an FYI, if you are in the states, most places by law are required to have handicap accessibility. Usual it's a tucked away chair lift/elevator. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Just something to keep in mind. People with mobility issues are able to enjoy music and dancing even in a wheelchair. \n\nYour parents hurt both of you, so start off kindly enforcing your boundaries, offer support without taking full responsibility.", "Then ESH. \n\nYour sister is in a wheelchair. They tried to do what they thought would be best, given how many struggles she is likely to face in life. Was it at times unfair to you? Yes. Life is unfair to everyone.

Once I'm finished college I want to move away again, somewhere far less close.", "I don't think it has been either. But my whole childhood was altered by that stuff too and I don't think my parents gave a single shit if it was hard on me too. I remember them giving me a hard time for wanting to go to a trampoline park for my birthday. I brought it up and heard for days how insensitive I was for wanting to do that for my own birthday when my sister couldn't take part. I was 11. Every single birthday I'd had was in our local park for disabled kids. Where friends and I could not use the swings or any of the actual equipment. Each of those years I had wanted something different and was told no. But that year for my 12th birthday they spoke to me like I was asking for something truly evil. Not to mention being on vacation and wanting to swim at the hotel pool we'd be staying at. That was also a huge deal where I was told I should never ask something like that.\n\nI will never forgive them for how they treated me and I will never let them be in my life the way they might think they deserve to be.", "If that's the hill you want to die on. So be it.\n\nBut it doesn't change my judgment because it's a very privileged hill to die on.", "It is.

Don't argue with her, let her vent as if to a wall. You're better off letting her direct her misguided anger towards you until she comes to her own realization that you are a person too.

This is something you are attending with your friends. Period. End of discussion. You are allowed to do things without including her. And likewise, she is allowed to have friends and do things that don\u2019t include you.

You absolutely don't have to do everything with your sister. Whether disabled or not. You also should not have been placed in a caregiver role at a young age and without consent.\n\nHowever, places that aren't accessible suck. You have the choice to go anywhere you like. Your sister doesn't. It isn't necessarily about you not doing everything together, but that it's a place that she might enjoy and she can't go. It's not that she is physically incapable of partying, it's that this club has chosen not to be accessible and her sister doesn't care. (At least to her perspective.) You talk about how you felt having choices taken from you. Your sister didn't have a choice at all. That isn't to say you can't feel upset or angry. But recognize where your sister is coming from. She also likely has feelings about her choices and lack thereof.\n\nMaking a place accessible doesn't make it any less enjoyable for able folks, but it makes it inclusive for everyone. Disabled people have to constantly fight for accessibility or mourn that something is inaccessible. It is important for them to have allies and advocates. If more places are called out for lack of accessibility, then there may be fewer places which are inaccessible. \n\nIt may be helpful for your family to do some counseling.

Your parents have messed up pushing you into the role of caretaker when you should\u2019ve just been a kid and her sister. Now of course teaching you to be aware of your sisters disability and encouraging a good, supportive relationship between you two sisters (NOT sister and caretaker) would\u2019ve been perfect but instead they\u2019ve taught you \u201cdon\u2019t do anything or go anywhere your sister can\u2019t.

They should\u2019ve helped teach your sister that sometimes life doesn\u2019t work out exactly the way you want and you can\u2019t have your way all of the time but they didn\u2019t and I\u2019m sure if she pulls this shit with other people it\u2019s not going to go the way she wants. Plus resorting to such cruel words ain\u2019t going to win her friendship points either. She\u2019s an adult, she can handle being told no. She\u2019s not going to combust into flames for goodness sake and it\u2019s not the end of the world. Besides, you have to live your life hun. Stick to your boundaries or create some to protect yourself. You are not in the wrong for wanting to do one singular activity without your sister when you\u2019ve literally lived your entire life doing only what she could be part of.

I still guard a few hobbies and friends away from her, I don't want to share everything with her, because so much of my life was co-opted into hers when we were kids. To this day I do not have a close relationship with her and I do not want one. \n\nMake your own life. Have your own friends. That's normal and that's how life goes as a matter of course.

None of this is your fault and you shouldn't face repercussions. She is an adult now and should start acting like it. Soon you will have a BF then husband and kids they will become your priority she cannot keep relying on you to be her maid/entertainment. She needs therapy and healthy boundaries.", "NTA what the actual f? I have a sister and would never include her in all my plans, friendships and activities because we are NOT THE SAME PERSON! She has her life/interest/hopes/challenges and I have mine. Yes, we love each other so spend time when it suits us both to catch up and do things of mutual interest. What an awful dynamic your family has setup. I'm really sorry that you were in that position as a child. Loving a sibling doesn't mean serving their needs all the time. It doesn't mean moulding your life to suit their life. In terms going to the party - even if it was accessible, why would she go with you and your friends? Shouldn't she be developing her own friendship and social interactions? Why is she thinking she's automatically invited to everything in your life?\n(Btw my sister is on the spectrum and can be vulnerable with self care, so my mum has said to me as an adult, please always keep an eye out for her as we get older/after mums gone. No problem because that's my sis, but that was never asked in my childhood)", "While it\u2019s absolute crap that these places are not accessible, was she even invited to these events? It sounds like these are YOUR friends and she is mad she can\u2019t tag along instead of hanging out with her own friends\u2026I\u2019m not sure this is about accessibility so much as your sister not having her own life. Your parents made her dependent on you instead of letting her grow up into her own person and now that you\u2019re both out in the world, she doesn\u2019t appear to have her own life. Surely if she was invited by HER friends, they would pick places that she could actually go?!? I don\u2019t think I know anyone who went to the same college at the same time as their sibling\u2026 NTA but maybe it\u2019s time to transfer and get your own lives because this isn\u2019t healthy.", "op=nta\n\nWhy?  Just because you are sisters, doesn't mean you have to do everything with your sister.  \n\nTake the disability out of the equation. \n\nWhat if you wanted to go to a strip club(in a year) but couldn't take your sister.    \nOr what if you wanted to go mountain climbing but you had a sibling who didn't like heights.  \nWhat if you liked Heavy Metal and she liked Celtic Music.  You wouldn't attend same concerts, live bands, clubs etc.  Based on preferences.\n\nYou are 20, and finally get to make choices about what you do and who you see.  Your sister had to understand that no matter her circumstances, you are going to do things that don't include her.", "NTA - Good grief! Your parents are at fault as they didn't teach your sister to be more self-sufficient. For example, most people know how to entertain themselves or have some activities that they can do when nobody else is around . . . Why do you need to be there 24/7 for her? Will this be expected of you for the rest of your life?", "When my dad was growing up, his older brother was diagnosed with MD. Because of this his entire life became about the brother (whom he loved and still misses to this day). The biggest issue was that my dad wasn't allowed to do anything that his brother couldn't also do. In high school, many sports coaches reached out to my grandparents and begged them to let my dad play, but since my uncle couldn't, it was always a firm no. This kind of childhood isn't fair to either child, and OP you are definitely NTA.", "I think it is okayish to ask you to plan events accessible to her. It is excessive though, to also expect all your friends to plan all events accessible to her. And it is very excessive to ask you to never attend your firends events if they are not accessible for her. NTA", "NTA\u2014you shouldn\u2019t have to change your entire life for a family member. She wasn\u2019t invited to the party so it doesn\u2019t matter if it was accessible or not. If it was, did she expect to be tagging along like she\u2019s a kid? How awkward for your friends and, depending on the event, costly for the organizer of the party if they didn\u2019t count an extra person in their count (admission or refreshments or table set aside for your group or fire code numbers). I get that she\u2019s jealous and lonely but she can\u2019t co-opt your life forever just because you\u2019re related. You deserve to have a life without HAVING to consider her. Your parents may have begun teaching you things in case of emergency, which makes sense, but to put your life on hold because of her health issues isn\u2019t fair to you. My middle child is a Type 1 diabetic so the other two always knew how to help him out in an emergency but we had been counseled by an endocrinologist to not allow any of them to have sugar, go trick or treating, or have stockings/Easter baskets/birthday cakes because it was \u201ceasier.\u201d Yeah, easier for them to resent him for making his restrictions theirs\u2026\nNTA for wanting your own life without an anchor or guilt trip, as harsh as that sounds", "NTA\n\nYour parents did neither you nor your disabled sister any favors. While it's a great idea to ensure she has everything accessible, it's completely ridiculous to insist your entire life needs to be that way.\n\nAnd then to insist you be her caregiver when, guess what, she's not your child. That's just ridiculous.\n\nIf they had it their way you'd be living at home permanently, still being her caregiver, still having your entire life revolving around your sister.\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA \n\nReading your post made me sad for you as well as your sister. \n\nFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective it sounds like your parents forced you to be your sister\u2019s only friend as well as wanted to make you her primary care giver. \n\nWith your age difference I would have expected you would have had at least 2 years in college without being responsible for your sister so a hopefully normal experience. \n\nRegardless it sounds like your sister, contrary to her previous words, wants you to continue to include her in all of your activities which from her perspective makes sense as that seems to be all she knows. \n\nIMO you should spend some time with your sister but as other posters have noted she needs to start making her own friends and not rely solely on you for everything she does.  \n\nUnless you want to do otherwise, I also hope you are readying yourself for the eventual discussion with your parents if you do not plan to take over your sister\u2019s care once you graduate or when your parents can no longer care for your sister. \n\nIf they haven\u2019t already your parents should look into if there is life training available for your sister so she can live if at all possible on her own. \n\nIf such training is not available or not feasible for your sister they should look into what type of housing/care would be available.", "NTA  It's considerate to make sure that some of your plans are accessible but no, she doesn't get to demand that every single plan you make involves her.\n\nI'm disabled and it sucks when there are things I can't join in on but I'm an adult and it's my job to process those feelings.", "NTA.\n\nAnd just because you are siblings doesn't mean you have to be friends, best friends, or spend all your time together.\n\nI think your parents were grooming you to be your sister's bestie and caregiver without even thinking about what you wanted out of life.\n\nYou should create some distance to force your sister to find her own way through life.", "It sounds a lot like sister disagreed with it because she knew her parents/her would get her way. Now OP doesn't have to do as theyre told, so sister can't look good and still get what she wants. So she's weaponised her disability.", "Disabled or not, codependent behavior is completely unhealthy and detrimental for both of you.\n\nYour sister expecting you to revolve your entire life around her is trying to force you into a  completely codependent relationship with her.", "I think you are completely right. The reason the parents were so upset that OP left is they were deprived of their caregiver.\n\nAnd had to start doing all that overindulged caregiving themselves. And found how much work it is.", "Please take my free award! My younger sister is my BFF as adults (hair-pulling cats & dogs as teens) and while we do a lot together, it is not everything. She married one of my friends and when they started dating I consciously stepped back from that friend group give her the chance to establish herself as an individual and not as my sister. Everyone knows we're sisters, but neither of us are known only as so-and-so's sister. OP's parents did both girls a disservice in not allowing them to become individuals. Why wasn't younger sister encouraged to find her own interests? Maybe OP could help encourage and cheer on sister in finding those things now.", "Op doesn\u2019t sound ableist. The parents are. Stating that they didn\u2019t want her to hang with disabled kids show a fact, that the parents are ableist. Op was a kid how was her supposed to make that happen?", "That\u2019s fair. The accessible parks I\u2019ve seen were incorporated to have both wheelchair friendly access and able-bodies access. I\u2019m sorry that you were denied the ability to enjoy things because they were so wrapped up in things being equal they forgot about you entirely.\n\nIt genuinely sounds like they did what was easiest for them, not necessarily what was best for both of you. Because again, a disabled child can go in the water - they need more supervision, but the shallow end and flotation devices exist. Your parents could have found a way.\n\nDistance is healthy. Goimg no contact is smart. They fucked around, they\u2019re finding out. But even if not now, I do still recommend therapy. As I said before, you have a lot anger and resentment, probably a lot trauma and maybe c-ptsd. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not someone who can tell you that. But those labels exist to help you navigate life. If you get into a future relationship, being able to explain \u201cI have diagnosed XYZ and therefore I am no contact with my parents, any contact without my explicit permission would be a deal breaker,\u201d absolves you of bringing up a past you don\u2019t wish to revisit. And sets a definite boundary that if they make contact the relationship is over. Period. No explanation on your part required. It\u2019s perfunctory and useful. \n\nBut I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet, so do what you will with my advice. As I said earlier, you\u2019re not an asshole for wanting to live your life how you want. You get to do that. So I wish you the best."]}
