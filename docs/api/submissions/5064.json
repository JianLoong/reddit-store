She isn't an AH yet. But conversations about what she expects of you besides hanging out every couple weeks and what your boundaries are need to happen soon.

Your parents however are and in raising you both the way they have, have also created an AH in your sister. No siblings are joined at the hip entirely. You can be close as sisters, do things together but still have separate lives. Disability aside, I wouldn't want a sister tagging along when I'm doing stuff with MY friends. Your sister needs to find some of her own and cut out the BS otherwise she'll find herself blocked just like your parents. Sadly, this is where I see this ending for you. Stick to your guns, you've done nothing wrong, you've already put enough of your life on hold through no choice of your own, do not make anymore allowances for her. And if she starts with her BS again, block her for a period and tell her why!", "Lol. Your parents forced you to be with her all the time, forced her to be with you all the time, basically preventing both of you to have a healthy circle of friends and other interests.

Perhaps you should point out that college is a time for people to find themselves and what they'd like to do.  My sisters and I all attended the same university.  We hung out sometimes.  Most of the time, we did our separate things.  Regardless of accessibility, it would be very weird for someone's 18 year old sister to tag along all the time.", "NTA. You are allowed to live your life.", "NTA, you were essentially being groomed to be her caretaker if your parents were to die or decide it\u2019s time for you to take over full time. You are not responsible for her. Live for yourself OP. \n\nTheir words will come back to bite them.", "NAH. I have a similar situation. I\u2019m 30F. My sister (27F) is in a wheelchair. \n\nI think your parents failed both of you - you by asking you to be a caretaker and sacrifice significantly, and her by not helping her develop a healthy and independent social life. \n\nYou\u2019re at a naturally difficult juncture as siblings at your age. You should be doing more things with your own friends independently, and you don\u2019t have to cancel plans for your sister. It\u2019s also natural for her to feel left out and lonely when you\u2019re growing up and becoming more independent. It\u2019s a normal sibling dynamic, but especially heightened when the younger sibling has a disability. But demanding that you cancel your plans is unfair and it\u2019s not your job.\n\nIf I could offer one small piece of advice, it would be to make plans with your sister *in advance* sometimes on a Friday or Saturday night. This will help her feel like you still care and want to spend time with her not just when you don\u2019t have something else going on. I know for my sister it hurts to feel like she only gets attention if someone doesn\u2019t have something better to do, or if people act like their plans with her can be rescheduled all the time since she has a pretty open schedule. Planning in advance will help her feel like she\u2019s important to you still.  Hope it works out <3", "YTA.\n\nYour parents overdid it, which gave you some kind of oppositional defiant issues. Your sister shouldn't ask you to change plans to include her.\n\nBut it's not this one night. You became an adult who seems to constantly feel the need to say \"I can do whatever I want and what I want is not to hang out with losers in wheelchairs\". I don't think that your sister suddenly wants you to never do anything without her. I think she is hurt because you never want to do anything with her.\n\nYou blocked your parents just for calling you. Your behaviour is extremely resentful, your sister is better off without you in her life. Do everyone a favour and just calmly and politely say that you need some space to work through your issues.", "I have been doing that but clearly, it's not enough for her because I am not making sure she can be involved in everything. And I feel like if this is how she's going to feel about things going forward then our relationship will be as dead as mine and our parents.

I live in an apartment with friends now and she's living in a dorm.", "They'll never understand that. They will forever think I should be glad to just do things my sister can do and to make my life fully accessible to her. It's why we'll never have a good relationship.", "I would be expected to make them live their lives the way my parents made me live mine as a kid. So we'd never do anything my sister couldn't and their birthdays and our family vacations would need to be all inclusive of her.", "Yes and I made it clear I would not be, and she does not need one.", "I'm spending it with my friends/roommates this year. None of us are going \"home\" and honestly it's not home for me anymore so I'm glad to not be going.", "My sister does have friends. But she struggles socially because she doesn't like to ask them to slow down for her, or to go at her pace, but also doesn't want to have friends with disabilities. My parents never quite got her involved in groups for disabled kids and never encouraged her to make friends who were disabled and not disabled. They focused on her having not disabled friends.\n\nSo she's spending more time alone and wants to go back to the way things were when we were both at home and my parents made me make sure she could be included in everything.\n\nShe does not rely on me for transport.\n\nI also do hang out with her. I have been. But it's not enough anymore.", "Not just the family vacations, but what I could and couldn't do was limited based on what my sister could do. And my birthday parties should have been more about me than anyone. What's the point of those parties when I never got to enjoy them because there was nothing fun to do for me? At that point just tell me I can't have any since the park we used had nothing for able bodied kids to use.", "I do stuff with her. We hang out at least once every two weeks. Ever since she moved I have made time for us to hang out but I won't go back to how things were and I won't have my parents give me shit for not doing what they forced on me as a kid.\n\nI have a lot of anger at my parents. Maybe I even hate them.", "Your parents did both of you a huge disservice. You, by forcing you into a caretaker role and restricting your opportunities. Your sister, by letting her grow up with the expectation that everything should revolve around her and her needs. Does your sister attend therapy sessions? If not, it might be very helpful for her so she can learn to adjust her expectations.", "Which is absolutely reasonable. My best advice would be to encourage her to spend time with her friends and put herself out there. If there is tension between the two of you then try to keep that open contact but leave the ball in her court with how the relationship is, making it clear that you love her and are there for her but the expectations need to be realistic.", "Siblings don't do everything together. My brother is my best friend, but we still do things separately. Have separate friends, in addition to mutual. Imo the discussion with her shouldn't even be about her disability, but should be about each of your autonomy. Even if she wasn't disabled, you would do things without her. She needs to accept that you are separate people and you are going to do things without her.", "NTA\n\nI think this is something that just needs time to get past. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her an explanation for your actions so don\u2019t worry about defending yourself.  You\u2019re not responsible for managing her emotions. She\u2019ll learn to work through them\u2026or she won\u2019t. But it\u2019s not your problem", "Unfortunately, that means you and them probably will never be close.  And my guess is that they don't realize their attitude will make their dream of you taking care of her not very likely when they need you too.", "Yeah, no. I would be done if I were you. Your parents sound horrible and your sister sounds like she's the result of their upbringing. It would take some strict boundaries for me to have a relationship with them going forward. The first boundary being that you are an actual person, not a caretaker.", "It might be time to start planning your future apart from your family. You have a right to a life that is not centered on your sister and does not involve being her caretaker. That is not your responsibility. Your parents should be making plans for your sister\u2019s future and considering the options that do not burden you.", "Good for you. Merry Christmas.", "Have you tried hanging out with her and her friends? Or a group hsng out? Or is it usually just one on one. It really can't be just you. \n\nYour sister is probably only just now facing grief over her lost opportunities. That's not on you. She probably needs therapy. \n\nShe needs to be able to explain her limits to her friends not just expect you to accommodate her. She is young and if she has never done this then it's going to be hard to become the self advocate she needs to be. \n\nTry talking, ask if there is a way you could help her does not involve you being her social coordinator. Find out where she is struggling. \n\nUnless you are in an area surrounded by \"mean girls\" most people are very accommodating of physical limitations in social situations. \n\nJust an FYI, if you are in the states, most places by law are required to have handicap accessibility. Usual it's a tucked away chair lift/elevator. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Just something to keep in mind. People with mobility issues are able to enjoy music and dancing even in a wheelchair. \n\nYour parents hurt both of you, so start off kindly enforcing your boundaries, offer support without taking full responsibility.", "Then ESH. \n\nYour sister is in a wheelchair. They tried to do what they thought would be best, given how many struggles she is likely to face in life. Was it at times unfair to you? Yes. Life is unfair to everyone.

But you are an adult now and it is your responsibility to go get therapy and work through your anger.", "For your sister to throw such a fit over one disco party makes it clear that she is terrified of being left to fend for herself.

Once I'm finished college I want to move away again, somewhere far less close.", "I don't think it has been either. But my whole childhood was altered by that stuff too and I don't think my parents gave a single shit if it was hard on me too. I remember them giving me a hard time for wanting to go to a trampoline park for my birthday. I brought it up and heard for days how insensitive I was for wanting to do that for my own birthday when my sister couldn't take part. I was 11. Every single birthday I'd had was in our local park for disabled kids. Where friends and I could not use the swings or any of the actual equipment. Each of those years I had wanted something different and was told no. But that year for my 12th birthday they spoke to me like I was asking for something truly evil. Not to mention being on vacation and wanting to swim at the hotel pool we'd be staying at. That was also a huge deal where I was told I should never ask something like that.\n\nI will never forgive them for how they treated me and I will never let them be in my life the way they might think they deserve to be.", "If that's the hill you want to die on. So be it.\n\nBut it doesn't change my judgment because it's a very privileged hill to die on.", "It is.

Abusive people do that thing where they reduce the trauma they cause- to something 'ridiculous'.\n\nA lifetime of cruelty is reduced to \"it was just birthdays\" or \"food\" and conveniently forget all the cruelty that imploded on an event.\n\nAlso, Op did not say they were cutting off anyone. They said they want to attend a party they have had plans for, for weeks.\n\nI am African. I grew up taking care of my younger ones. I did not have to take care of any in a wheelchair.

I just don't know anyone who has always gotten the birthdays that they wanted. \n\nAnd yes OP has said she blocked her parents and will never talk to them again *because of the birthdays*, specifically.

But especially do not let it restrict or define those around you. They will resent you for it even if it is not consciously. It is better to let them do something without you than for them to miss out and harbour resentment.\" I think that's more or less what was said. I learned to lie, so my friends and family could do things I could no longer do. It hurt on occasion but I realised that sometimes I couldn't be accommodated. Your sister needs to learn this.
