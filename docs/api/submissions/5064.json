She isn't an AH yet. But conversations about what she expects of you besides hanging out every couple weeks and what your boundaries are need to happen soon.

Your parents however are and in raising you both the way they have, have also created an AH in your sister. No siblings are joined at the hip entirely. You can be close as sisters, do things together but still have separate lives. Disability aside, I wouldn't want a sister tagging along when I'm doing stuff with MY friends. Your sister needs to find some of her own and cut out the BS otherwise she'll find herself blocked just like your parents. Sadly, this is where I see this ending for you. Stick to your guns, you've done nothing wrong, you've already put enough of your life on hold through no choice of your own, do not make anymore allowances for her. And if she starts with her BS again, block her for a period and tell her why!", "Lol. Your parents forced you to be with her all the time, forced her to be with you all the time, basically preventing both of you to have a healthy circle of friends and other interests.

Perhaps you should point out that college is a time for people to find themselves and what they'd like to do.  My sisters and I all attended the same university.  We hung out sometimes.  Most of the time, we did our separate things.  Regardless of accessibility, it would be very weird for someone's 18 year old sister to tag along all the time.", "NTA. You are allowed to live your life.", "NTA, you were essentially being groomed to be her caretaker if your parents were to die or decide it\u2019s time for you to take over full time. You are not responsible for her. Live for yourself OP. \n\nTheir words will come back to bite them.", "NAH. I have a similar situation. I\u2019m 30F. My sister (27F) is in a wheelchair. \n\nI think your parents failed both of you - you by asking you to be a caretaker and sacrifice significantly, and her by not helping her develop a healthy and independent social life. \n\nYou\u2019re at a naturally difficult juncture as siblings at your age. You should be doing more things with your own friends independently, and you don\u2019t have to cancel plans for your sister. It\u2019s also natural for her to feel left out and lonely when you\u2019re growing up and becoming more independent. It\u2019s a normal sibling dynamic, but especially heightened when the younger sibling has a disability. But demanding that you cancel your plans is unfair and it\u2019s not your job.\n\nIf I could offer one small piece of advice, it would be to make plans with your sister *in advance* sometimes on a Friday or Saturday night. This will help her feel like you still care and want to spend time with her not just when you don\u2019t have something else going on. I know for my sister it hurts to feel like she only gets attention if someone doesn\u2019t have something better to do, or if people act like their plans with her can be rescheduled all the time since she has a pretty open schedule. Planning in advance will help her feel like she\u2019s important to you still.  Hope it works out <3", "YTA.\n\nYour parents overdid it, which gave you some kind of oppositional defiant issues. Your sister shouldn't ask you to change plans to include her.\n\nBut it's not this one night. You became an adult who seems to constantly feel the need to say \"I can do whatever I want and what I want is not to hang out with losers in wheelchairs\". I don't think that your sister suddenly wants you to never do anything without her. I think she is hurt because you never want to do anything with her.\n\nYou blocked your parents just for calling you. Your behaviour is extremely resentful, your sister is better off without you in her life. Do everyone a favour and just calmly and politely say that you need some space to work through your issues.", "I have been doing that but clearly, it's not enough for her because I am not making sure she can be involved in everything. And I feel like if this is how she's going to feel about things going forward then our relationship will be as dead as mine and our parents. It's frustrating because I do love her, and I have told her that, but I don't want to cater everything I do to be around her again.", "> you are entitled to do things on your own, with your friends.\n\nThis was my exact thought - even if the place was accessible, it is 100% ok for OP to want to go out with her friends _without her sister_.

I live in an apartment with friends now and she's living in a dorm.", "They'll never understand that. They will forever think I should be glad to just do things my sister can do and to make my life fully accessible to her. It's why we'll never have a good relationship.", "I would be expected to make them live their lives the way my parents made me live mine as a kid. So we'd never do anything my sister couldn't and their birthdays and our family vacations would need to be all inclusive of her.", "Yes and I made it clear I would not be, and she does not need one.", "I'm spending it with my friends/roommates this year. None of us are going \"home\" and honestly it's not home for me anymore so I'm glad to not be going.", "My sister does have friends. But she struggles socially because she doesn't like to ask them to slow down for her, or to go at her pace, but also doesn't want to have friends with disabilities. My parents never quite got her involved in groups for disabled kids and never encouraged her to make friends who were disabled and not disabled. They focused on her having not disabled friends.\n\nSo she's spending more time alone and wants to go back to the way things were when we were both at home and my parents made me make sure she could be included in everything.\n\nShe does not rely on me for transport.\n\nI also do hang out with her. I have been. But it's not enough anymore.", "Not just the family vacations, but what I could and couldn't do was limited based on what my sister could do. And my birthday parties should have been more about me than anyone. What's the point of those parties when I never got to enjoy them because there was nothing fun to do for me? At that point just tell me I can't have any since the park we used had nothing for able bodied kids to use.", "I do stuff with her. We hang out at least once every two weeks. Ever since she moved I have made time for us to hang out but I won't go back to how things were and I won't have my parents give me shit for not doing what they forced on me as a kid.\n\nI have a lot of anger at my parents. Maybe I even hate them.", "Your parents did both of you a huge disservice. You, by forcing you into a caretaker role and restricting your opportunities. Your sister, by letting her grow up with the expectation that everything should revolve around her and her needs. Does your sister attend therapy sessions? If not, it might be very helpful for her so she can learn to adjust her expectations.", "Which is absolutely reasonable. My best advice would be to encourage her to spend time with her friends and put herself out there. If there is tension between the two of you then try to keep that open contact but leave the ball in her court with how the relationship is, making it clear that you love her and are there for her but the expectations need to be realistic.", "Siblings don't do everything together. My brother is my best friend, but we still do things separately. Have separate friends, in addition to mutual. Imo the discussion with her shouldn't even be about her disability, but should be about each of your autonomy. Even if she wasn't disabled, you would do things without her. She needs to accept that you are separate people and you are going to do things without her.", "NTA\n\nI think this is something that just needs time to get past. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her an explanation for your actions so don\u2019t worry about defending yourself.  You\u2019re not responsible for managing her emotions. She\u2019ll learn to work through them\u2026or she won\u2019t. But it\u2019s not your problem", "Unfortunately, that means you and them probably will never be close.  And my guess is that they don't realize their attitude will make their dream of you taking care of her not very likely when they need you too.", "Yeah, no. I would be done if I were you. Your parents sound horrible and your sister sounds like she's the result of their upbringing. It would take some strict boundaries for me to have a relationship with them going forward. The first boundary being that you are an actual person, not a caretaker.", "It might be time to start planning your future apart from your family. You have a right to a life that is not centered on your sister and does not involve being her caretaker. That is not your responsibility. Your parents should be making plans for your sister\u2019s future and considering the options that do not burden you.", "Good for you. Merry Christmas.", "Have you tried hanging out with her and her friends? Or a group hsng out? Or is it usually just one on one. It really can't be just you. \n\nYour sister is probably only just now facing grief over her lost opportunities. That's not on you. She probably needs therapy. \n\nShe needs to be able to explain her limits to her friends not just expect you to accommodate her. She is young and if she has never done this then it's going to be hard to become the self advocate she needs to be. \n\nTry talking, ask if there is a way you could help her does not involve you being her social coordinator. Find out where she is struggling. \n\nUnless you are in an area surrounded by \"mean girls\" most people are very accommodating of physical limitations in social situations. \n\nJust an FYI, if you are in the states, most places by law are required to have handicap accessibility. Usual it's a tucked away chair lift/elevator. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Just something to keep in mind. People with mobility issues are able to enjoy music and dancing even in a wheelchair. \n\nYour parents hurt both of you, so start off kindly enforcing your boundaries, offer support without taking full responsibility.", "Then ESH. \n\nYour sister is in a wheelchair. They tried to do what they thought would be best, given how many struggles she is likely to face in life. Was it at times unfair to you? Yes. Life is unfair to everyone.

But you are an adult now and it is your responsibility to go get therapy and work through your anger.", "For your sister to throw such a fit over one disco party makes it clear that she is terrified of being left to fend for herself.

Once I'm finished college I want to move away again, somewhere far less close.", "I don't think it has been either. But my whole childhood was altered by that stuff too and I don't think my parents gave a single shit if it was hard on me too. I remember them giving me a hard time for wanting to go to a trampoline park for my birthday. I brought it up and heard for days how insensitive I was for wanting to do that for my own birthday when my sister couldn't take part. I was 11. Every single birthday I'd had was in our local park for disabled kids. Where friends and I could not use the swings or any of the actual equipment. Each of those years I had wanted something different and was told no. But that year for my 12th birthday they spoke to me like I was asking for something truly evil. Not to mention being on vacation and wanting to swim at the hotel pool we'd be staying at. That was also a huge deal where I was told I should never ask something like that.\n\nI will never forgive them for how they treated me and I will never let them be in my life the way they might think they deserve to be.", "If that's the hill you want to die on. So be it.\n\nBut it doesn't change my judgment because it's a very privileged hill to die on.", "It is.

I'm sure, growing up, your parents were just trying to make their daughter feel like she was included. That was good of them. Where they fall short, though, is making you *feel* like a caregiver. Those things they taught and asked you to do for your sister should be things you do willingly and not feel obligated to do.\n\nYour sister was fortunate to grow up having access to everything your parents found for her.

There tend to be clubs for nearly everything in colleges, surely there's got to be one that interests her.  \n\nThis isn't to say that you just abandon her completely.  Have your friends met her, and does it seem like maybe they'd be alright hanging out with her, at least sometimes?

That is not your fault and I hope with therapy she can come to learn healthy ways to cope instead of guilt tripping to get her way.

Your sister was dealt an unfortunate hand being stuck in a wheelchair but she seems downright possessive of you. It is difficult sometimes to blame parents for wanting what's best for their child but also they screwed the pooch on the relationship dynamic between you and your sister. All that coddling and now there's all this resentment between you both.\n\nMy take: you should only hang out with her on your terms from now on until she starts to chill out. Don't argue with her, let her vent as if to a wall. You're better off letting her direct her misguided anger towards you until she comes to her own realization that you are a person too. She sounds obsessed with the idea that you have to always be a convenience for her, which even in her circumstances is entitled. You don't need to defend yourself here. She's your sister and will probably need some time and maturing to understand how things will be going forward.", "NTA. My husband is terrified of heights. It's always been my dream to go sky diving. Do I expect him to go with me? Absolutely not. Does he expect me to give up this item on my bucket list for him? Also absolutely not. This clearly is not a perfect comparison, but we do lots of things that not everyone wants to do or is able to do. That's not exclusionary, that's life.\n\nAnd the above doesn't even begin to touch on how abused and neglected you were as a kid being forced into the role of her caregiver. She doesn't even seem to realize how extensive this caregiving was and how detrimental to your life it's been. Your parents are absolutely TAs, but if she keeps up their attitude,she will be, too.", "NTA. Your parents pushed so hard on that terrible stance (you having to take care of her and include her in everything) that the successfully got your sister to believe that that's how thing are and should be. That's not true though - you have your own life, and you have no inherent responsibility to take care of her constantly and include her in everything.", "NTA, i feel bad for your sister, but she\u2019s being a royal pain. Your parents shouldn\u2019t have forced you to be a caregiver, that\u2019s a form of abuse (Adverse Childhood Experiences are all classified as abuse). Your parents are to blame, OP, they failed both of you. She didn\u2019t ask to be put in a wheelchair, and you didn\u2019t ask to be her caregiver. The biggest AH are your parents.\n\nWith that said, I\u2019m surprised about the lack of access to basic needs like ramps and such. I assume you\u2019re not in the US. It\u2019s federal law that establishments be wheelchair accessible. It\u2019s because of ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) that ramps and other accommodations are added to establishments, as well as protecting those with disabilities from discrimination.", "NTA - but not for the reason you may think. Your parents have handicapped her more than any disability ever could.\n\nI firmly believe that accessibility needs to be more of a priority and more places need to be made accessible. People who use wheelchairs are not second class citizens and deserve to experience all life holds. So birthdays, vacations, your school needing to be fully accessible to her? Yeah. Check your privilege.\n\nHowever, you are not the asshole for wanting your own life. Whether the \u201880s Disco Christmas is accessible is moot. This is something you are attending with your friends. Period. End of discussion. You are allowed to do things without including her. And likewise, she is allowed to have friends and do things that don\u2019t include you. If she makes a friend who invites her on an expensive trip somewhere, just remember that you both get to be your own people - it\u2019s not just when it benefits you.", "NTA. She is guilt tripping you. She\u2019s using her handicap, as did your parents, to manipulate you. Don\u2019t fall for it. Does she realize that she can make her OWN friends?", "Sounds like it was easier for her to side with you when she knew you wouldn\u2019t win the argument.\n\nNTA", "I'm torn on a verdict, but leaning to a mild Y T A. You absolutely don't have to do everything with your sister. Whether disabled or not. You also should not have been placed in a caregiver role at a young age and without consent.\n\nHowever, places that aren't accessible suck. You have the choice to go anywhere you like. Your sister doesn't. It isn't necessarily about you not doing everything together, but that it's a place that she might enjoy and she can't go. It's not that she is physically incapable of partying, it's that this club has chosen not to be accessible and her sister doesn't care. (At least to her perspective.) You talk about how you felt having choices taken from you. Your sister didn't have a choice at all. That isn't to say you can't feel upset or angry. But recognize where your sister is coming from. She also likely has feelings about her choices and lack thereof.\n\nMaking a place accessible doesn't make it any less enjoyable for able folks, but it makes it inclusive for everyone. Disabled people have to constantly fight for accessibility or mourn that something is inaccessible. It is important for them to have allies and advocates. If more places are called out for lack of accessibility, then there may be fewer places which are inaccessible. \n\nIt may be helpful for your family to do some counseling. It may be helpful to have someone meditate so that they can better see your side, and help you all find some balance.", "NTA. I\u2019ve seen this play out in real life and I commend you for your patience thus far. However, your sisters disability, while it\u2019s unfortunate she may not be able to do everything you can do or go wherever you can go, does not mean that YOU \u201cneed\u201d to solely accommodate her on every single thing every single day. Your parents have messed up pushing you into the role of caretaker when you should\u2019ve just been a kid and her sister. Now of course teaching you to be aware of your sisters disability and encouraging a good, supportive relationship between you two sisters (NOT sister and caretaker) would\u2019ve been perfect but instead they\u2019ve taught you \u201cdon\u2019t do anything or go anywhere your sister can\u2019t. Everything revolves around your sister.\u201d That\u2019s just not how the world is going to work for you or your sister and it\u2019s a shame it\u2019s taking this long going r this lesson. Back to what I said about seeing this in real life: your parents are acting unfair to you and if they keep it up they\u2019ll end up with one child or at the very least limited contact with you. They should\u2019ve helped teach your sister that sometimes life doesn\u2019t work out exactly the way you want and you can\u2019t have your way all of the time but they didn\u2019t and I\u2019m sure if she pulls this shit with other people it\u2019s not going to go the way she wants. Plus resorting to such cruel words ain\u2019t going to win her friendship points either. She\u2019s an adult, she can handle being told no. She\u2019s not going to combust into flames for goodness sake and it\u2019s not the end of the world. Besides, you have to live your life hun. Stick to your boundaries or create some to protect yourself. You are not in the wrong for wanting to do one singular activity without your sister when you\u2019ve literally lived your entire life doing only what she could be part of. On a side note the way she immediately flipped out when you wanted to go clubbing without her makes me wonder if she\u2019s never been told no before???????", "NTA. It's unfortunate you had to go to the same college, but you are two different women with two different and separate lives.  Disability aside, the sibling relationship doesn't mean bonded. Sure, personalities and interests willing, there can be some overlap, but if she continues to try to force it, you rightfully will resent it and pull away. Your parents did neither of you a favor.", "NTA. \n\nMy sister is disabled. As a teenager I went through some years of both wanting to disappear, because it felt like we got stared at wherever we went and I had a weird celebrit\u00e9 because of her, and also wanting to be seen for myself, and not as an extension of my sister. I still guard a few hobbies and friends away from her, I don't want to share everything with her, because so much of my life was co-opted into hers when we were kids. To this day I do not have a close relationship with her and I do not want one. \n\nMake your own life. Have your own friends. That's normal and that's how life goes as a matter of course. You shouldn't be expected to cancel all your plans to accommodate her. If she were invited, that's the time to make sure things are accessible for her. \n\nAnd hey, if you've never heard of this book, it's worth a read: The Normal One: Life with a Difficult or Damaged Sibling by Jeanne Safer. It's often a bit taboo to talk about the ways in which growing up with a disabled sibling marks you for life even under the best circumstances: we are the lucky ones, after all, living life on easy mode compared to our disabled siblings. But the advantages are fairly superficial and can be overshadowed easily when we are expected to make our entire lives about our sibling or sacrifice ourselves for them.", "NTA. Your parents set your sister up for disaster. Instead of putting her in position to make friends and do things that accomadated her, they centered everything on you and forcing you to make sure she\u2019s included.

While difficult, the needs of all children should be addressed.", "NTA. I have a disabled sister too. While it does mean we have to make things like weddings and birthdays accessible for her because she\u2019s, you know, part of the family, you are not her caregiver and you have a right to your own life. I get it, it\u2019s hard to carve out a life for yourself that doesn\u2019t revolve around caring for her. Absolute NTA and I hope you find a good balance for this.", "NTA. I think they were fair in that things involving her had to accommodate to her, and it's very normal for parents to pick the high school a child goes too. But the limit is they where expecting you to be a carer for her and expected you to give up all your own Dreams to only do what she wants/can do. Your allowed to be your own person apart from her and your allowed to do things she can't without her. Your parents are AHs and your sister is clearly used to be spoilt.", "Also, it\u2019s perfectly normal for an older sibling to have plans with friends that don\u2019t involve younger siblings. All you\u2019re essentially doing here is treating her as you would if she were able bodied.", "Agreed. I'm disabled and aside from the few things I need assistance with, I do my own thing. Even when you aren't as independent, requiring someone to spend 24/7 with you is exhausting (this is a general you lol). \n\nI'm very independent but there's a couple things I can't do, like change my bed sheets because of the height of my bed will make me pass out, and sometimes my dad will pick up my non-deliverable prescriptions on his way home since he passes by and I don't leave the house much (I WFH and I get groceries delivered). \n\nI understand the pain of things not being accessible but even if the sister was able-bodied, there's no reason they need to do everything together. The sister is using her disability to attach herself to OPs social life at OPs expense. \n\nI feel for both of them but op is NTA and sister needs to realize that.", "Nicely said. I\u2019m sorry that happened to you", "Even if she were able bodied, you are two years older and would most likely have different activities and friends than she has. You have your own life to lead. Somehow the two of you need to build an normal sisterly relationship, not the you-are-your-sister\u2019s-caretaker relationship your parents tried to force on you."]}
