Also, I hate when people get called out on something they know they screwed up and then make themselves the victim of the situation. He probably knew your stance on that kind of thing and went with it anyways.", "NTA. At first I was going to say you were but after he insisted on you giving your opinion, what did he expect. It\u2019s a bit strange he went against your wishes and made it about himself. (Simply going off the information that was provided)", "NTA\n\nHe asked a question that had a 50/50 chance of not liking the answer to. \n\nThe thought was there and he might have missed the memo or he just wasn't paying attention. It IS the thought that counts and at least he didn't have it tattooed on YOUR skin as a surprise gift! lol \n\nBut his reaction to your truth is an AH move. He asked for your honesty and he got it.", "NTA- it's a shame really. You could've worked cooperatively with the artist to come up with something truly special to both of you. But he got something that he probably knows you wouldn't like to steal the spotlight.\n\nForcing you to admit something that he already knew going in isn't cool.", "That doesn't really feel like it's for you though does it? It feels like an attention getter or a way to start a conversation.", "NTA, you were the one with cancer not him, and you also specifically said you didn\u2019t care for those types of bumper stickers or designs etc.", "NTA. Sounds obscenely dumb to me. While I understand the sentiment against cancer, I can't imagine making something like that permanent without discussing with the person who is supposed to feel supported by it and then beign shocked when it doesn't go over well.", "NTA the gesture was very sweet but if you\u2019ve been clear about how you aren\u2019t a fan of the f cancer bumper stickers and other things. Shouldn\u2019t really be putting something permanent on your body for someone else without asking and then gets upset when the person who he got it for without asking doesn\u2019t like it. Also congrats on bill of full health I hope you are feeling better", "NTA - Whether the tattoo was tasteful or not, he turned your illness into social currency.", "NTA- I\u2019ve definitely had this conversation with my family. As a sibling, i most definitely would have asked her opinion ~before~ doing anything in \u201cher honor\u201d or \u201cto support her\u201d.", "NTA.\n\nVirtue signalling, plain and simple. It was never about you because if it were, he would have followed your wishes. \n\nCongrats on beating cancer!", "NTA\n\nHe did so it out of respect and love and you said you appreciated that. He asked you a question and told you to be honest and you were. \n\nAlso, I'm so happy that you overcame Cancer! You're so strong! Much love to you\ud83d\udc96", "NTA\n\nIt is not on other people to live up to your expectations when you do something stupid. I'm sure he feels bad right now. I'm sure in his own head he really thought he did something. But this was a myopic, most likely self-centred thing to do.", "NAH. You tried to be polite and spare his feelings, and that's good enough. \n\nIt was a nice gesture on his part and if he had really cared whether you liked it he could have asked you first. \n\nHe got something he liked, in your honor, and it's ok if you don't like it, too, as long as you appreciate the thought. There are no AHs here.", "It's his tattoo - he's the one who needs to like it!\n\nIt's awesome that he altered his body permanently in support. So what if you don't like the design? Dorks. Give a him big hug and tell him you love him.\n\nNAH", "I'll go against everyone Y(kinda)TA. I mean you having cancer has an effect on people that love you. Maybe it's just how he feels about the whole thing, \"fuck cancer\". People aren't always going to show their support in the best ways I guess, but you can choose to instead see the meaning behind it to them. He saw his sister suffering, and I imagine that's painful enough for someone to say \"fuck cancer\".", "I\u2019m glad you feel like TA because you are one. Your brother did something supportive and you just shit in him. It\u2019s not just you that went though that horrible mess but so did everyone who loves you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You know that he did it for a good reason but you have said you didn\u2019t like that design in the past.\n\nJust give him time and he will get over it.", "NTA! They knew how you felt but wanted to force it on you and make your diagnosis about him! Say that to his ass and watch him sit TF down!\n\nYou deserve better! It is YOUR diagnosis! That should be respected!\n\nSuper happy you're doing well!!", "Nta. He means well, but doesn\u2019t get it.", "NTA.\n\nHe got a tattoo to support you without first consulting you on the design, then got pissy when he learned that you didn't like the design. Of course you're not gonna like the design, you already said you didn't like it. Why would he try to show support by getting a design he already knows you hate tattooed on his leg forever? And even more baffling, why would he make himself to be the victim in this situation that could have easily been avoided if he had just thought about it for 2 more seconds?", "Plus she said it in THE most tactful way possible. WTF does this guy want?", "Yeah in all honesty a lot of these gestures really feel more like cries for attention (shaving heads, tattoos, social media posts, etc.) \n\nI get that many of these people do in fact have genuine intentions, but like with this tattoo in particular people are probably going to assume that the brother had cancer. If not, then he still gets browny points for being such a caring sibling! (Even though op did not like the tattoo)", "The shaving the head thing is understandable to a degree.", "Yeah I think it depends in all honesty, for example my cousin shaved his head when my aunt had breast cancer (and he had been growing it out for over a year at that point). \n\nIn general it\u2019s best to ask the person you\u2019d be doing the gesture for if they\u2019re okay with it. It would also mean avoiding this whole situation here. Now brother is stuck with this tattoo."]}
