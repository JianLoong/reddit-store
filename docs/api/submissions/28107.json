{"id": 28107, "submission_id": "16ye5tq", "title": "AITA for not wanting to raise my little sister anymore?", "selftext": "Me (25f) and my husband (29m) recently took in my little sister (10f) earlier this year. She was living with her grandpa (74m), who has terrible health, in a half abandoned apartment building.\n\nBackstory: My little sister is my half sister; we share the same dad (42m). Her mom (36f) raised my sister till she was 2, and my sister has been with her grandpa ever since. Raising a child never aligned with her mom\u2019s party lifestyle. Her mom is also bipolar, doesn\u2019t take her medication, has outbursts, does other drugs, etc. Our biological dad just got out of prison for DWIs, broke probation, and is now wanted. Her grandma lives out of state and is rarely home with her love for travel.\n\nThe problem: It\u2019s been really hard for me ever since we took my sister in. It\u2019s been hard to adjust going from no kids, to a 10yo, plus all the trauma. She can get under my skin, like siblings do, but she\u2019s a good kid. But I am questioning if we should let my sister live with her grandma (50f) after she finally expressed interest in raising her (for the record, her grandma said no the first time). But that decision comes more problems that I\u2019ll come back to.\n\nMy feelings: I stopped talking to my dad\u2019s side when I went away for college (2018). They are pretty dysfunctional, struggle with alcoholism, teen pregnancies, etc. However, ever since we took my sister in, I now have to deal with them. This has brought up a lot of trauma for me, tears, fears, and hate. I should also note that they are not a fan of being cut off from her.\n\nMy sister\u2019s feelings: What complicates it even more is that my sister doesn\u2019t really understand the dangers. She bounces between wanting to live with us and wanting to go back. When we initially brought her in and away from her grandpa\u2019s bad living situation, her grandma and mom said they couldn\u2019t take care of her. So I stepped in. Now, her grandma said she is willing to take her in. She feels guilty and wants to make it right. We originally said no, but my sister was 100% on board. This of course stirs up sadness and resentment in my heart. I went through a lot to bring her in. But I hate myself for feeling this way. She\u2019s a kid, so she believes the best in people.\n\nHer grandma: Her grandma doesn\u2019t have a place to stay yet and doesn\u2019t have a date to move. She will most likely be with my sister\u2019s mom. Plus, that means being closer to the dysfunctional family.\n\nUltimately, I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m even questioning letting her grandma take her in. Because in all her years, her grandma has never proven to change. I wish I was stronger to deal with all the trauma, but I\u2019ve never felt more mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted in my life. I also feel like I\u2019m \u201cgiving up\u201d when I said I would give her a better life.\n\nAm I the asshole because I feel like I simply can\u2019t do this anymore? My sister would be thrilled to move in with them, but I feel guilty as an adult letting a child decide.\n\nSorry \u2014 I should also add that we are her legal guardians in the meantime. Her parents signed over their rights after they didn\u2019t take her in the first time. We have to have her in our care for 6 months before we can adopt.", "created_utc": 1696294753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ye5tq/aita_for_not_wanting_to_raise_my_little_sister/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if another family member can take her in, you'll still have responsibilities.  If the person you give  her to care for her proves unsuitable, and she comes to harm, it will be a mess for you.\n\nSee if there are any public resources to help you, especially since you accepted (temporary?) guardianship, but haven't adopted.  Does she have a social worker?  They can help arrange for help, and it is in their interest to help you, if the alternative is that she winds up in the foster care system because you can't manage on your own.\n\nIf you'd taken her in as a foster child, without accepting guardianship, she'd be eligible for a lot - Medicaid for health insurance, cash benefits to her caretaker, food stamps, counseling, etc.  All of which would help ease your burden. It still may be possible to get some of this help.\n\nIs she in therapy?  Almost all family services agencies have therapists who specialize in helping kids with exactly her type of abandonment issues and traumas.  They might also have therapists who help family caretakers in your situation.  And things like parenting classes for foster parents, which teach people to deal with these situations. \n\nYou took her in with good intentions.  But, as you have learned, good intentions aren't the same as good parenting skills for raising a child with abandonment traumas, and they don't help pay the extra bills that come with having a child.  \n\nFor the moment, it sounds as if you are stuck.  Even if the grandmother is willing, she doesn't have a suitable place for the child to stay.  So look for other sources of help, outside the family.  And don't let anyone in the family stop you with pressure that these family matters should be handled privately, within the family.  The family, as a whole, just doesn't have the resources.  Get what help you need, don't worry about family secrets, and if there are consequences, such as the father's legal situation becoming worse, that's his problem to deal with, not a reason for you to avoid getting help.  \n\nYou are looking for support for \"kinship guardianship\" in your state.  If you are in NY, this site is an example of some of the help available: [https://ocfs.ny.gov/programs/kinship/background-and-process.php](https://ocfs.ny.gov/programs/kinship/background-and-process.php)", "The issue doesn't sound like it's in taking your sister in, it's in dealing with the family. If you put your foot down and say you're keeping her, that's final, and you're not dealing with her toxic family members, that's probably the best thing for your sister and for you.", "NAH but man do I feel bad for your sister. Staying with grandma sounds like a certain path to bad things but staying with somebody whose trauma is triggered by her existence/connections sounds pretty awful too.", "NAH. \n\nThis is clearly taking its toll on you; I strongly suggest that you get some mental health supports because it's clear that this is bringing up some stuff that's making it harder for you to take care of your sister. A professional would also be able to help you learn to set better boundaries with your family so that you can protect your mental health. Your sister could probably also use some support considering it sounds like she's been through a lot.\n\nYour sister needs a stable home with someone who is actually able to take care of her and by the sounds of it, the only other option doesn't have stable housing. Your sister's wellbeing is the most important thing in this situation and any decision you make should be based on that.\n\nI think it's going to be extremely important for you, if you decide to keep raising her, to not just let things continue as they are; if your family is causing you stress and making you a worst caregiver, it's a really good idea to rethink their level of involvement.\n\nIf you decide to continue raising your sister, you should also contact a family law lawyer to talk about custody and decision making for your sister (family law varies a lot from place to place and they'll be able to help you make sure that you don't get any surprises later on). If you decide to let her live elsewhere, if you have even a slight concern about her wellbeing with that person, it might be a useful to involve child services.", "I hesitate to call you an AH here since you have been trying your best and did not create this situation.\n\nHowever, it definitely sounds like staying with you gives her the best chance at a good life.\n\nI know it's frustrating right now but, how much more will it hurt in a few years when she turns out like the rest of your family because you let her go?\n\nIt sounds like you have no easy choices here.", "There is no right answer, and you can not take the child's wishes too seriously. Not that her wishes don't matter, but she's been shuffled around too much to know what she wants or what would make her happy. At that age, she's also responding to some extent to what she believes would make those around her happy. \n\nIs the family court involved in her care due to the mothers neglect and abandonment? If so, there's likely a social worker assigned. If not, maybe it would be a good idea to get them involved. We did that with my nephew when, at age 14, he was finally bounced to our home after three sets of grandparents, and both parents had given up on him at least once each. We were in a different state than he originated, and I got a case against my sister for abandonment, which led to a state appointed placement in my care, which gave me resources for providing for him. If you eventually determine that even with these resources, you aren't equipped to help, you'll have a social worker who can help determine the right placement. Throughout this process, you may request a guardian ad litem for your sister, too. \n\nUltimately, if you're not able to handle her, you aren't doing her any favors by keeping her. Do what you think is best for both of you.

While it may be nice to want to help, you're not obligated to, especially not if it upsets your entire life.  If her actual parents can't step up, and if others can't or won't do so, then she needs to go into foster care.  This doesn't mean that you can't have contact, just that she may need to be with a set of people more equipped to deal with her.", "You are allowed to have a life. You are allowed to be exhausted for going above and beyond. NAH.", "I'm not going to say that you're an AH. Every parent feels completely overwhelmed at times. You probably more than most because you're young and dealing with a child who has clearly been in a very dysfunctional environment for a long time. So, no, not the AH. \n\nHowever, you are, by all rights and means, her parent now. You stepped in and said you would take care of her so she is your chosen responsibility. It sounds like her family is not in a good place. Why do you still have to deal with them? If they're not taking care of her, you should be able to continue to cut them off while raising her in the best way possible. I might suggest you go in the complete opposite direction - instead of giving her up, adopt her. This way, you can give the middle finger to all of the dysfunction of the family while giving your sister a chance at an actual, good life.\n\nNo choice you make is going to feel like the right one. Welcome to parenting!", "If you legally adopted her, she's your responsibility; you can't just \"give her back\".
