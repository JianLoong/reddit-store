My sister(27f) was pretty skinny mostly. Recently she's been dealing with mental health and depression and has been on medication and she's put on quite a bit of weight. In the last year and a half I've been working out and eating right. No personal trainer or gym membership. I just got an app and only eat a certain amount of calories a day. I enter in all the workouts and the calories I've burned and I've lost and have been losing quite a bit of weight. I was very out of shape and had high blood pressure/heart problems so I just decided overnight to make a change. I am NOT one of those people that shoves fitness and healthy eating down everybody's throats. I don't bring up the calories and fat content in things. It's just my own personal lifestyle and I know how much consistent effort weight loss can take so I don't judge. I went from 350 pounds to 220.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister has been trying to lose weight too. I don't see my sister daily as we live in different states now but when we see our parents we see each other. And for the last year and a half, every time she's seen me I've gotten smaller and smaller. She's happy for me but lately she seems kind of upset/jealous of it. We were at our parents a few months ago watching a game so there was wings, pizza, and beer. I ate a few wings, a slice of pizza, and just periodically snacked on celery and hummus the rest of the night. Her and the rest of the people were eating lots of pizza and wings and I made no judgement but she was commenting on how prissy this is. Most recently we were at Applebee's with our parents and she ordered a double cheese burger and after her I ordered grilled chicken breast and broccoli. She kind of blew up at the table. She was like \"okay!\" and said I'm rubbing my weight loss in everyone's face. I told her that I'm not and that this is just how I eat now. This became a whole discussion and she said I probably still crave burgers that I can never eat. I told her that I didn't get this way by never eating burgers. I just eat burgers less and fit it into the diet. She said I was being annoying and this went on for a while. I just eventually told her that I've never brought up my weight and that only she has and that I'm not longer going to talk about it if she gets this way. So I just kind of ignored her the rest of the meal and focused on our parents. Later she texted me and said she was being rude but I was also being rude for always eating healthy food in front of her.

You've had success with this, and she has been really struggling. It's not okay for her to project onto you, but don't take it personally.

I feel bad for her because weight loss is hard. But it\u2019s no one\u2019s responsibility but the person trying to lose weight to make adjustments to food intake.

Now, had you only been eating crap food in front of her, she'd equally blame you for that and making her fat.", "NTA - Congratulations on your lifestyle and achievement.

Self-control for her will not come until she chooses it for herself.", "NTA she has her own insecurities and she needs to deal with them. Unfortunately I have noticed that especially online people tend to tip toe around being overweight and not holding people accountable. It is unhealthy to be extremely overweight. And if she truly wanted to make that change, the way you did, then she could. Whether it be depression or just laziness stopping her, it's not your fault. Just remind her that you are not responsible for how she feels. She is the only knew responsible for her actions and reactions. \n\nP.s. nice job on the hard work and dedication! That takes a lot strength. I wish you well on your journey and health!", "NTA. Also, your sister is in serious need of therapy. That's not meant to be judgmental, just a statement of fact.

You are amazing.  Hug yourself, not for 'losing weight', but living healthy.  \n\nYour sister's mental health issues do not give her a free 'Get out of AH Jail' card.  \n\nDon't take it personally, and keep telling her, I don't discuss that. Don't engage her.  Let her ramble by herself.", "NTA She let her insecurities get the better of her.", "NTA. It sounds like all you are doing is choosing certain foods, you have not commented at all on her food choices or tried to influence anyone else. Sounds like she is jealous - but you absolutely should not have to eat pizza and burgers for her. It sounds like she has even seen you eating pizza and wings - just not much of it. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s struggling but you shouldn\u2019t have to jeopardise all of the efforts you\u2019ve put in. \n\nMy sister and I are somewhat similar - I was historically the bigger of the two of us but I\u2019ve lost weight and she has gained a bit and we are now similar, with me a bit smaller. She needs to come to terms with this. I assume has other health conscious friends - just is used to you being bigger than her and not liking that you\u2019ve switched.\n\nAlso - congratulations on your weight loss, that\u2019s a huge achievement!", "NTA. First off great job! Losing weight is hard work. I\u2019ve never dealt with weight issues but I do, do personal training. My trainer\u2019s philosophy is be good 80% of the time and enjoy yourself the other 20%. The only foods I limit in my diet (or try to at least lol) is sweets. It really is all about moderation", "NTA, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to just tell her to keep her eyes on her own plate and not to worry about yours.  I\u2019d also probably realize that her behaviour is probably still pretty heavily influenced by her depression and ignore her comments.", "NTA. I had to change how I ate because my bloodwork came back indicating some not so good stuff. I did end up losing some weight and improved my cardio fitness and there\u2019s always someone who thinks it\u2019s their business to comment on my choices.", "NTA.

Not you, how your sister was talking down to you for positive changes.", "NTA by the way congratulations and you're doing an amazing job", "NTA.  Omg.  Weight loss is a solo journey and it's a lifestyle change.  If it matters that much to her she can always get her own table.", "People have primal connections to food, they do not act predictably or rationally in many cases I find.

This would be like a vegetarian eating vegetables in front of someone\u2026\u2026.  I do feel bad for her since certain anti-depressants do cause weight gain. She should talk to her doctor about a different treatment options.", "You can\u2019t fix anyone but yourself. You\u2019re not responsible for her choices nor should you be berated for making personal choices.  \n\nI used to work at an office that brought in donuts almost daily. If not donuts then cake and other sweets.  At that time I was racing bikes and had changed my diet to avoid processed foods and especially foods with corn syrup. Once you\u2019ve stopped eating corn syrup, it gets to the point you can taste the corn syrup and it has a funky aftertaste that I found gross.  \n\n\nI got crap pretty much daily because I was fit and healthy \u2018already\u2019.  I never shamed anyone for their choices or even said anything to another but those others had no reservation about comments on my choices. Oddly enough, it was always people who could have used to drop a few dozen or more pounds. \n\nI chose to ignore and not engage but damn it was hard to stay quiet watching people simultaneously mock my choices while being 50 pounds overweight and become out of breath climbing a set of stairs.", "NTA. I see posts like this all the time. She's jealous of your ability to lose weight and eat healthy and is taking it out on you.

This isn\u2019t an overnight quick fix, this is work. She wants the benefits without the work, and that\u2019s not how life works. It\u2019s you who put in the effort, who changed their diet, who placed all this emphasis on calories and staying healthy and you deserve to be proud! You\u2019ve done so well. \n\nHonestly, it sounds lame saying this, but she is jealous. She is jealous of your success and is acting like a bucket of crabs. She doesn\u2019t understand that once you\u2019ve made this choice it becomes a lifestyle. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t like junk food it\u2019s that you actively CHOOSE to cut down on it. It\u2019s that you CHOOSE yourself over the five second food gratification. She doesn\u2019t have the drive to do what you have and hates seeing you become something she thinks she can\u2019t be. Instead of rooting for you, she wants to see you fail. Please don\u2019t give her the satisfaction. Also, it sounds like she doesn\u2019t have a good foundation of dietary needs and benefits, and they (family) thinks you\u2019re being a snob and rejecting them. This insecurity is coming from them and they are trying to dump it on you. You\u2019re not judging them, they are judging themselves. They know to some extent their choices are affecting their health, they know their weight is connected to their food choices. They are made you aren\u2019t making the same choices and holding up a mirror of what good choices look like. \n\nJust like it\u2019s hard to make good choices around someone who makes bad choices, it\u2019s hard to make bad choices when shown the rewards of good choices.", "NTA. I (25F) have always been thinner than my sister (31F) until quite recently. She even gave me some clothes that are now too big for her that fit me better than clothes I personally own as I've grown out of them. The jealousy can set in at times, but I've had to just accept it and/or make appropriate changes. I'm already down enough weight to no longer need her hand me downs again. I also struggle with mental health issues and I understand why she's feeling so defeated and upset. She really isn't upset with you about what you eat, she's just upset she doesn't look the way she used to and is upset with how she feels her diet affects her weight gain. Be supportive of her and let her know you are there to talk and love on her when she needs it, and you're happy to help guide her, but just know it's not about you, she's just taking it out on you.

They also hinder your ability to lose weight.\n\nI know from personal experience. However, if having to choose crazy or fat, I'll pick fat every time. I exercise a lot! I eat healthy most of the time. However, the weight I put on while getting my meds figured out just won't come off unless I starve myself entirely..\n\nI get where your sister is coming from. It's a hard pill to swallow, so to speak. This doesn't make you an AH. You have zero to do with it. My sister started working out and lost quite a bit of weight. She was like you, high blood pressure, etc. She feels better and has been able to get off a lot of meds. This makes me so happy for her. I really don't give a rats ass what she chooses to eat.\n\nHopefully, your sister is getting therapy as well as taking meds so she can work through her issues...\n\nFat is WAY better than crazy.  I've been to the mental health ward of the hospital, and I'll deal with whatever to NEVER go back...\n\nHappy you are happy!", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in your position, so also see both the overweight and slimmed-down perspectives. When we\u2019re overweight we\u2019re hypersensitive to judgment and criticism and can see/hear it even when it\u2019s not really there. Your sister wants commiseration and validation of herself and her choices, and she\u2019s likely feeling extra betrayed and put out because you *used* to be in her shoes and if you still were she\u2019d have an eating buddy. \n\nNone of this is your fault - keep doing what you\u2019re comfortable with when it comes to your mental and physical health. :)", "Nta.\n\nI have been in your sisters place but it was a friend who was losing weight.\nI would be lying if I said I wasn't jealous, but I never even thought that she was rubbing it in my face or anything like that.\nMental health issues suck and when your body changes because of it, it is hard seeing people achieve great things that you could do or have tried to do. But it doesn't give anyone the right to blow up at anyone.", "NTA at all. Congratulations on your progress!!!", "NTA - I get weight loss is hard and your sister is probably struggling. It can be aggravating for sure. That said, you aren't doing anything wrong. All you're doing is changing your lifestyle and sticking to that change. You aren't shaming your sister, lecturing her, or shoving your lifestyle down her throat simply because you eat a particular way in front of her. No shame to your sister by any means because, again, the struggle is real trying to lose weight...it just sounds like she's projecting her insecurities on to you.", "NTA\n\ni didnt know eating certain type of foods was rude...just wow", "Nta. That's a her issue and not a you problem.", "NTA, you're allowed to eat whatever you want and it's not like you're rubbing it in her face...", "She\u2019s struggling - doubly so as some mental health issues were at play, she\u2019s projecting, but taking it out on OP, which makes her TA. OP is NTA.\n\nEdit to clarify.", "I went onto a similar diet by choice so I understand all about the temptation of wanting to eating foods that are \"off diet\"and how hard it can be to resist.", " It\u2019s pretty obvious she is hoping you\u2019ll eat more so that she has \u201cpermission\u201d to eat as much also.", " If it makes her feel any type of way that\u2019s a her problem.\n Nothing stops her from eating what you\u2019re eating/learning from your example.", "I all have a similar relationship where we have lively discussions, different opinions etc. My brother on the other hand finds this extremely anxiety inducing", "Wrong sub, buddy.", "alat", "She has insecurities, that\u2019s her problem to work on", "a lot of mental health meds will increase weight gain. Some will make you crave food constantly.", "You live a healthier lifestyle than I do, I\u2019d probably eat a whole pizza if no one was looking.\n\nYou should be proud of yourself, you lost the equivalent of a 5\u20197 person riding on your back. Keep up the good work.", "I'm the same now with greasy/salty food. And on the few occasions I have overindulged, my intestines remind me why a lot of grease is a bad idea for me.", "NTA Congratulations on making good changes. Hopefully your sister will do the same and stop being jealous.", "Definitely not your fault your sister comfort eats and feels threatened by living proof weight loss starts with sensible eating.", "\"I'm into fitness -- fittin' this whole pizza in my mouth.\" -- Larry the Cable Guy.", "Currently just had an adequate portion of pizza and am talking myself out of getting another slice.....\n\n\n\nNTA. Congrats on your improvements!"]}
