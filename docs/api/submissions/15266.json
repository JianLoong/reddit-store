My sister(27f) was pretty skinny mostly. Recently she's been dealing with mental health and depression and has been on medication and she's put on quite a bit of weight. In the last year and a half I've been working out and eating right. No personal trainer or gym membership. I just got an app and only eat a certain amount of calories a day. I enter in all the workouts and the calories I've burned and I've lost and have been losing quite a bit of weight. I was very out of shape and had high blood pressure/heart problems so I just decided overnight to make a change. I am NOT one of those people that shoves fitness and healthy eating down everybody's throats. I don't bring up the calories and fat content in things. It's just my own personal lifestyle and I know how much consistent effort weight loss can take so I don't judge. I went from 350 pounds to 220.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister has been trying to lose weight too. I don't see my sister daily as we live in different states now but when we see our parents we see each other. And for the last year and a half, every time she's seen me I've gotten smaller and smaller. She's happy for me but lately she seems kind of upset/jealous of it. We were at our parents a few months ago watching a game so there was wings, pizza, and beer. I ate a few wings, a slice of pizza, and just periodically snacked on celery and hummus the rest of the night. Her and the rest of the people were eating lots of pizza and wings and I made no judgement but she was commenting on how prissy this is. Most recently we were at Applebee's with our parents and she ordered a double cheese burger and after her I ordered grilled chicken breast and broccoli. She kind of blew up at the table. She was like \"okay!\" and said I'm rubbing my weight loss in everyone's face. I told her that I'm not and that this is just how I eat now. This became a whole discussion and she said I probably still crave burgers that I can never eat. I told her that I didn't get this way by never eating burgers. I just eat burgers less and fit it into the diet. She said I was being annoying and this went on for a while. I just eventually told her that I've never brought up my weight and that only she has and that I'm not longer going to talk about it if she gets this way. So I just kind of ignored her the rest of the meal and focused on our parents. Later she texted me and said she was being rude but I was also being rude for always eating healthy food in front of her. I think it's it's ridiculous", "created_utc": 1682009169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t7he8/aita_for_eating_healthy_food_in_front_of_my/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't let her pressure you into eating badly.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to eat, or not eat, whatever you want, and so is your sister. If she thinks that simply ordering the food you want is \"rubbing it in her face\", then that is her own insecurity that she needs to deal with. \n\nComing from someone who has also lost weight with the help of a diet change and a calorie tracker, I know how food preferences can shift once you avoid certain foods for long enough, and I also know the amount of willpower to resist certain cravings for foods you might eat less of, or avoid altogether. \n\nCongrats on your health journey so far and for sticking with it.", "NTA she's just jealous. Everyone is allowed to eat whatever they want", "NTA she\u2019s projecting her insecurities onto you.", "NTA\n\nFirst off, Congratulations!  Losing weight can be challenging when you don't have the added stress of a sibling nagging you about it.  I'm sorry that your sister is trying to make your health and wellness journey about her.  The next time she brings it up, ask her if she would like recommendations on what you have been doing, if she says no then it might be appropriate to let her know you are not going to discuss the topic with her further.  She doesn't need to be bothered by what you eat or how often.", "WOW - you are not allowed to eat because of blah blah blah.\n\nYour sister has issues which she needs help with addressing.  She seems to want you to start eating unhealthier so that will enable her not to change.", "NTA. This is her own insecurity problem, not yours.", "NTA. She's jelly. You're not. Show her what you've been doing to lose weight. If she doesn't want to try, then she will see that it's not you, but her. If she doesn't want to listen to reason, let her feel crappy on her own.", "NTA it's her issue, not yours.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry this was an issue in the first place. You didn't do anything wrong by eating healthy food in front of her. You are literally just trying to eat. She needs to calm down, it's not like you looked at her food choice and made a comment about it \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA Misery loves company and she's just getting upset because you are using willpower to stick to a healthy diet when she can't/won't.", "NTA.\n\nShe definitely sounds insecure and is being aggressive because you have the self-discipline she struggles with. \n\nJust ignore it. You can't make everyone happy. Put yourself first.", "NTA. She's jealous, having body image issues, and hates that you're starting to look good and healthy. Honestly, who does she think she is thinking she can criticize you for wanting to be healthy and *enjoying* eating healthier?", "NTA, what you eat is none of her business. She has insecurities, that\u2019s her problem to work on", "NTA. She is being ridiculous. My guess is she wishes she had your determination. Good job on your journey to better health.", "NTA. You\u2019re eating food. It\u2019s rude to comment negatively on someone\u2019s food.", "NTA\n\nKeep doing you men, losing 130 lbs is impressive men and she is just jealous that she doesnt have what it takes", "NTA.\n\nYou are an adult and can decide for yourself what you eat, just as she can. There is no rule that says if junk food is available everyone has to eat it.", "NTA, my impression is the she is jealous of your self-control. I went onto a similar diet by choice so I understand all about the temptation of wanting to eating foods that are \"off diet\"and how hard it can be to resist. You have done NOTHING wrong, it's her.", "NTA. All you did was order the food you wanted. From the sounds of it, you weren't rubbing it in her face and instead were just eating what you wanted.", "NTA - According to her logic you\u2019re supposed to eat terribly when with her because that\u2019s what she needs.

It does not seem that any conversation can occur right now where you won\u2019t be seen as the bad guy.", "NTA.

I'm sorry your sister is going through some stuff, but that is 1000% not on you.", "NTA yes indeed she's being ridiculous", "NTA", "NTA. Our insecurities are our own responsibility, it's not fair to put that pressure on others.", "NTA. She's being a crab in the bucket, best not to engage with that kind of behaviour.", "NAH - you can eat what you want and she can eat what she wants. Surely, you know this has nothing to do with you. She is feeling insecure and as her sibling, she's naturally going to compare herself to you. Frankly, she's probably afraid everyone is comparing her to you. You've had success with this, and she has been really struggling. It's not okay for her to project onto you, but don't take it personally. I would approach her about this with love and empathy and just keep explaining that you're not judging how anyone else is eating, you're just doing you. She will realize in time that she was projecting.", "Godamn I'm not reading alat", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I feel bad for her because weight loss is hard. But it\u2019s no one\u2019s responsibility but the person trying to lose weight to make adjustments to food intake. It\u2019s pretty obvious she is hoping you\u2019ll eat more so that she has \u201cpermission\u201d to eat as much also.

I don't even enjoy eating large amounts of greasy/salty foods anymore. When I think about eating a bunch of pizza and all that oil I want to throw up these days", "2 paragraphs is \"alat\"? Schools really need funding don't they", "So why comment.  Do you walk into restaurants say I'm not ordering anything and walk out lol", "Kinda seems like you need the practise", "I always find it funny that people have to comment on what others eat, like it's their business. I stopped eating out at restaurants for a little more than a decade and co workers would just be stupefied that I don't eat out, don't eat greasy and cut out things like soya sauce because of the high sodium content.  When I get some junk food, it's like once a month and it will last weeks. NTA OP. Your sister should be inspired rather than dragging you down if she also wants to lose weight."]}
