My sister(27f) was pretty skinny mostly. Recently she's been dealing with mental health and depression and has been on medication and she's put on quite a bit of weight. In the last year and a half I've been working out and eating right. No personal trainer or gym membership. I just got an app and only eat a certain amount of calories a day. I enter in all the workouts and the calories I've burned and I've lost and have been losing quite a bit of weight. I was very out of shape and had high blood pressure/heart problems so I just decided overnight to make a change. I am NOT one of those people that shoves fitness and healthy eating down everybody's throats. I don't bring up the calories and fat content in things. It's just my own personal lifestyle and I know how much consistent effort weight loss can take so I don't judge. I went from 350 pounds to 220.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister has been trying to lose weight too. I don't see my sister daily as we live in different states now but when we see our parents we see each other. And for the last year and a half, every time she's seen me I've gotten smaller and smaller. She's happy for me but lately she seems kind of upset/jealous of it. We were at our parents a few months ago watching a game so there was wings, pizza, and beer. I ate a few wings, a slice of pizza, and just periodically snacked on celery and hummus the rest of the night. Her and the rest of the people were eating lots of pizza and wings and I made no judgement but she was commenting on how prissy this is. Most recently we were at Applebee's with our parents and she ordered a double cheese burger and after her I ordered grilled chicken breast and broccoli. She kind of blew up at the table. She was like \"okay!\" and said I'm rubbing my weight loss in everyone's face. I told her that I'm not and that this is just how I eat now. This became a whole discussion and she said I probably still crave burgers that I can never eat. I told her that I didn't get this way by never eating burgers. I just eat burgers less and fit it into the diet. She said I was being annoying and this went on for a while. I just eventually told her that I've never brought up my weight and that only she has and that I'm not longer going to talk about it if she gets this way. So I just kind of ignored her the rest of the meal and focused on our parents. Later she texted me and said she was being rude but I was also being rude for always eating healthy food in front of her.

You've had success with this, and she has been really struggling. It's not okay for her to project onto you, but don't take it personally.

Don't engage her.  Let her ramble by herself.", "NTA She let her insecurities get the better of her.", "NTA. It sounds like all you are doing is choosing certain foods, you have not commented at all on her food choices or tried to influence anyone else. Sounds like she is jealous - but you absolutely should not have to eat pizza and burgers for her. It sounds like she has even seen you eating pizza and wings - just not much of it. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s struggling but you shouldn\u2019t have to jeopardise all of the efforts you\u2019ve put in. \n\nMy sister and I are somewhat similar - I was historically the bigger of the two of us but I\u2019ve lost weight and she has gained a bit and we are now similar, with me a bit smaller.

I assume has other health conscious friends - just is used to you being bigger than her and not liking that you\u2019ve switched.\n\nAlso - congratulations on your weight loss, that\u2019s a huge achievement!", "NTA. First off great job! Losing weight is hard work. I\u2019ve never dealt with weight issues but I do, do personal training. My trainer\u2019s philosophy is be good 80% of the time and enjoy yourself the other 20%. The only foods I limit in my diet (or try to at least lol) is sweets. It really is all about moderation", "NTA, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to just tell her to keep her eyes on her own plate and not to worry about yours.  I\u2019d also probably realize that her behaviour is probably still pretty heavily influenced by her depression and ignore her comments.", "NTA. I had to change how I ate because my bloodwork came back indicating some not so good stuff.

She should talk to her doctor about a different treatment options.", "You can\u2019t fix anyone but yourself. You\u2019re not responsible for her choices nor should you be berated for making personal choices.  \n\nI used to work at an office that brought in donuts almost daily. If not donuts then cake and other sweets.  At that time I was racing bikes and had changed my diet to avoid processed foods and especially foods with corn syrup. Once you\u2019ve stopped eating corn syrup, it gets to the point you can taste the corn syrup and it has a funky aftertaste that I found gross.  \n\n\nI got crap pretty much daily because I was fit and healthy \u2018already\u2019.  I never shamed anyone for their choices or even said anything to another but those others had no reservation about comments on my choices.

This isn\u2019t an overnight quick fix, this is work. She wants the benefits without the work, and that\u2019s not how life works. It\u2019s you who put in the effort, who changed their diet, who placed all this emphasis on calories and staying healthy and you deserve to be proud! You\u2019ve done so well. \n\nHonestly, it sounds lame saying this, but she is jealous. She is jealous of your success and is acting like a bucket of crabs. She doesn\u2019t understand that once you\u2019ve made this choice it becomes a lifestyle. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t like junk food it\u2019s that you actively CHOOSE to cut down on it. It\u2019s that you CHOOSE yourself over the five second food gratification. She doesn\u2019t have the drive to do what you have and hates seeing you become something she thinks she can\u2019t be. Instead of rooting for you, she wants to see you fail. Please don\u2019t give her the satisfaction. Also, it sounds like she doesn\u2019t have a good foundation of dietary needs and benefits, and they (family) thinks you\u2019re being a snob and rejecting them. This insecurity is coming from them and they are trying to dump it on you. You\u2019re not judging them, they are judging themselves. They know to some extent their choices are affecting their health, they know their weight is connected to their food choices. They are made you aren\u2019t making the same choices and holding up a mirror of what good choices look like. \n\nJust like it\u2019s hard to make good choices around someone who makes bad choices, it\u2019s hard to make bad choices when shown the rewards of good choices.", "NTA. I (25F) have always been thinner than my sister (31F) until quite recently. She even gave me some clothes that are now too big for her that fit me better than clothes I personally own as I've grown out of them. The jealousy can set in at times, but I've had to just accept it and/or make appropriate changes. I'm already down enough weight to no longer need her hand me downs again. I also struggle with mental health issues and I understand why she's feeling so defeated and upset. She really isn't upset with you about what you eat, she's just upset she doesn't look the way she used to and is upset with how she feels her diet affects her weight gain. Be supportive of her and let her know you are there to talk and love on her when she needs it, and you're happy to help guide her, but just know it's not about you, she's just taking it out on you.

It\u2019s really hard to cold turkey things and it sounds really intimidating, you\u2019re doing great for making the change! I can honestly say that if you\u2019d told 10-years-ago-me that I\u2019d be keto, soda-free, gluten-free (that one turned out to be a requirement \ud83d\ude12), gave up beer, etc, I\u2019d say you\u2019re out of your damn mind. But slowly little by little I didn\u2019t want it anymore as I made small changes. \n\nSo, here\u2019s what I told my dad for his first baby step and between this past Christmas and April 1st, he\u2019s now lost 20 pounds doing only this at age 70. Here\u2019s the rules:\n\n1) ALWAYS CHECK THE INGREDIENTS LIST AND NUTRITION FACTS \n\n2) on the ingredients list, if it\u2019s a normal food item that has more than 2 grams of added sugar (specifically the ADDED sugar line in nutrition facts), don\u2019t buy it, find an alternative without the sugar\n\n3) if it\u2019s a food item that you can\u2019t understand why it would have any added sugar in it at all and it has sugar, don\u2019t buy it, get an alternative without the sugar. \n\nThe first week he called me to rant about the discovery that his favorite brand of canned Lima beans had 5 grams of added sugar. That\u2019s how they get you; their beans taste better and you\u2019re not quite sure why so you keep buying them, but they\u2019re only better from the sugar. If it\u2019s a sweet food, look for keto alternatives, it\u2019ll have other sweeteners. Try and stick to erythritol, xylitol, allulose, or monk fruit for the sweetener since those are naturally occurring sweeteners. No aspartame allowed. Though small heads up for xylitol products, it will kill the shit out of your dogs if you have them, keep it on a high shelf. \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind me offering a bit more unsolicited advice, I was in your shoes after college and it sounds like calorie restriction is what\u2019s making it harder on yourself. Don\u2019t worry as much about calories for now, you\u2019re on the right track. Try redirecting the cravings for sugar using fat instead of fake sweetness. Fat is your friend, not the enemy (sugar is the enemy), and if sugar is your villain, taking baby steps towards paleo or low carb/keto is probably going to make you feel the best.\nIf you crave sweet, grab some cheese or beef jerky; the fake sweet is probably making it harder to stop the cravings, kinda like how a Juul doesn\u2019t actually make you crave nicotine less, it\u2019ll just kill you less. For meals, instead of trying to fill up on a fuckton of vegetables or what not, fill up on a fuckton of fatty meat with veg. And add yoga :) I always send these to everyone trying to make a change, including my dad. \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iz9nsEjSS1o&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fddpyoga.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title", "That's the combo that did me in.

Obviously she\u2019s not eating health or she wouldn\u2019t have called out OP for eating healthy.", "I completely get it and you\u2019re doing great. But if you sometimes eat burgers could one of those times be with your sister?", "I work in veterinary medicine. I always make sure people listen when I say \"WEAR GLOVES WHEN GIVING YOUR PET MIRTAZEPINE\" (you give it to pets by rubbing the ointment onto the ear pinna - its used as an appetite stimulant in animals).", "Same. Fuck. Ive gained so much since being on venlafaxine. I don\u2019t really eat that much so i didnt get it. Oh man", "YES YOU ARE", "I've got a sister and I am and allways was the smaller/thinnier one of us. I have a quite unhealthy body image and some problems with EDs. If I imagine my weight would go up, while my \"bigger\" sister simultanieously would lose weight, honestly, I would struggle with it. Definetly NTA, but maybe try to understand your sister and ask her about her feelings, why she is bothered that much. Maybe this incident can be an opportunity to help your sister getting on a better state of mental health.", "NTA\n\nI think it would be best to straight up but kindly tell her that projecting her insecurities on you isn't acceptable. You could just ignore her but if she's the type of person that never gets corrected then there's less hope she will stop pulling BS like this. Or if you're feeling a bit spicy you could flip the script and ask her if it would sincerly make her happy if you started eating unhealthy foods and gained a bunch of weight.", "NTA. She is projecting. She knows she should be eating better but doesn't want to. So every time she sees you eating less food or healthier food it's \"forcing\" her to acknowledge her choices and that makes her uncomfortable. That doesn't mean that it's your responsibility or that you should sacrifice your health to make her more comfortable. \n\nAlso congrats on your weight loss.", "NTA. It's great you have changed your lifestyle. Your sister is jealous, sorry.", "What does she want you to do, eat junk food in front of her? \n\nSounds like that is what she wants. She wants you to eat poorly so she can justify eating poorly herself.\n\nNTA", "NTA - she's jealous and mad at herself and taking it out on you.\nCongrats!", "NTA. Eating healthier food never makes you the asshole. You only value and care for yourself. I personally wouldn't call chicken healthy either but everyone is free to eat whatever they want.", "NTA, you made a change, and that's just how you live, shes an asshole for flipping out for no reason, you eat healthy great for you, she doesn't that's her choice, and who cares, you didn't bring up weight at all, what she did is the equivalent of punching someone for no reason and playing victim, makes no sense", "I just read the first line..NTA..set a good example and don't be guilted into looking after yourself...EVER", "NTA, she's jealous. Keep kicking ass.", "I found the depression meds were the worst for that. I can sympathize with OPs sister. Those meds are hell on your body and make you want to eat crap. I couldn't believe the weight I put on, and I couldn't lose it till I was able to transition off meds. And it was not for lack of trying. She might be frustrated because she was actively trying to do what OP is doing, and the meds made it way more difficult. But OP is not responsible for how she feels, and she can't expect him to change his eating habits for her. If seeing OP eat healthy is enough to trigger a reaction like that, then the meds might be doing something they are weirdly known for doing, making her mental health worse.", "A combo of venlafaxine and mirtazapine hospitalised my husband for 3 days. It screwed his metabolism. He ended up really unwell and with blood sugar through the roof. They stopped the Mirtaz and his sugar dropped back to normal within 48 hours.\n\nIt was scary. We thought he might have a water infection because he felt really off so he dropped off a urine sample with the GP. Within an hour they called for him to come in because the dip test had shown high sugars. Then they tested his blood sugar properly at the surgery and the meter just read \"high\" which means it was out of range. The doctor basically told us \"go to A&E. If you have no way to get there yourself I will be calling an ambulance\" which was not reassuring. This was in the middle of the NHS hack so they were doing everything they could to keep people out of hospital. We also had a 6 month old, had just moved house, had no car and the hospital was nearly 2 hours and 2 buses away. (Rural area, bus to the nearest big town, then 45 minutes wait, then bus to the hospital in the nearest city) A kind friend took us.\n\nI felt so guilty afterwards. It was so freaking obvious. He was drinking upwards of 6 litres of fluids a day and I KNOW that excessive thirst is the most classic sign of diabetes/hyperglycaemia there is and I didn\u2019t freaking spot it! We thought he had dry mouth from another med! I felt so stupid! He takes 15 different meds each day so it can be tricky to filter out what\u2019s a problem and what\u2019s a side effect but I should have spotted that one.\n\nOnce discharged he was treated as though he was diabetic even though things returned to normal. Testing his sugars through the day, insulin if needed, metformin if his HBA1c got too high etc. Better safe than sorry I guess.", "Angry upvote to this."]}
