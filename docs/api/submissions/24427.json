I use spray on by Dove that works really well and has anti perspirant in it. regular Dove deodorant absolutely doesn't work for me in the slightest but their dry spray on is very good. it doesn't stay wet in my hair, either. the clinical deodorants are also really great (either men's or women's) and it can be way cheaper to buy at dollar general or walmart. in any case, it's worth the extra few bucks. also remember that anti perspirant is supposed to be applied the night before so it has time to block the sweat pores! it makes a huge difference in efficacy.", "If I don\u2019t smell currently I don\u2019t see why I should go out of my way to trim my armpits", "Some guys don\u2019t shave because they feel societal pressure not to.", "What's more femenine than a woman's natural body?

Who cares. I'm a 29 yr old woman who stopped shaving a few years ago. Anyone who has a personal problem with you keeping a natural thing about your body, that men also have, is the ones with the problem.. anyone who chooses to be bothered by it can get bent. It's not their body. Just because society has deemed unhygienic and gross and unwomanly for a woman to keep their body hair doesn't actually mean it's unhygienic or gross. As long as you're washing your pits on an average basis, and using deodorant when you need it literally makes no difference then a man having it. It is incredibly sexist for anyone to think otherwise just because men have it doesn't mean women shouldn't. If our bodies produce it, it's not wrong. My husband was with me before I stopped shaving, and he loves me just the same after I decided to stop shaving.

It helps provide chafing and rashes due to having wet skin rubbing together. Anti-perspirant has made it less needed, but shaving itself can cause irritation for many people. Irritated skin can be more susceptible to infection, making it less hygienic. Leg hair can also prevent chaffing--look up \"chub rub,\" a complaint a lot of women have about thigh chafing, likely exacerbated by shaving legs. Pubic hair also serves a protective function, stopping germs from entering the body, much like nose hair. \n\nIt's fine not to like those things, but saying everyone should shave or cover up based on your personal preference is pretty self-centered."]}
