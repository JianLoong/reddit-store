We have no say so, She literally just dropped the 3 kids off at the step and hit the gas and left.\n\nWhile she goes on Vacation with her daughter (My Niece) she expects the Grandparents to take the kids to school, pick them up, feed them, take care of them etc, But My mom and dad(Grandparents) are busy the next 2 days so no one can take care of the kids. I hear my mom tell the kids that I or my (Other brother about same age as me) will be taking care of them. I can't I don't have the time, I run an entire business and my other brother goes to College, We can't just drop everything to take care of their kids.\n\nSo I opened my door and I told the kids\" You guys have 3 houses, your dads house is 4k sqaure ft, and your mom has 2 4k square foot houses. Go home\" ( 3 of the youngest were dropped off )\n\nTheir dads house is  literally down the block from their grand parents(us) incase of anything they can just call and we'd be there in less then a minute.\n\nWhat got me really angered is the fact that I am already running around doing things for my brothers kids(That's fine, got no problem with that). I get to my brothers house to feed his animals and his daughters(Niece that went on vacation with mother) is there, I call her and ask her will you feed the animals? she responds she will only feed HER cat and will no feed their families dog. Okay I didn't get angry I just said ok and continued feeding the dog daily. But what angers me now is the fact that they are just leaving the kids with us, knowing their dad is on vacation and just going on a vacation for themselves. \n\nI feel used, This was completely planned out, They tried doing something similar on December 27th 2023 but my parents were OTR(On the road).\n\nNow everyone is mad at me, My mom and dad are acting like I don't want to help.\n\nThe kids are acting like I don't like them or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end I told my parents \" don't ever sign me up to do anything ever again, if the kids are stranded somewhere they can call me directly and ask me as a human being to go pick them up, Not use me as a transpiration and then treat me like shit\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUgh.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1704392351, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yju5x/aita_older_brother_and_his_ex_wife_leave_5_kids/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are an uncle and nothing more, right now they treat you like a step parent.", "INFO:  You agreed to watch 3 of your brothers kids?  Which 3?

Once you do that it will be a lot easier to set boundaries, but since it\u2019s your parents house without them on board it will be hard to set the boundary of not babysitting because they will just assume since your home you can do it. Maybe another alternative would be start charging them by the hour and make them schedule these times that they want your services. Make a business out of this lmao \ud83e\udd23.

He sounds like he would be happy to follow that plan, just have to have a serious conversation with your mother and see if she agrees to setting boundaries. I hate when parents can\u2019t see when one child is clearly taking advantage of them and never speaking up and putting there foot down. Your parents deserve some respect from the ex wife.", "Dude, she dumped her children (not older teenagers) on your doorstep and jetted. She *abandoned* them. Better for them to have some kind of adult supervision rather than *none at all*. \n\nMost kids that age will be okay, I think, but kids can be so careless and thoughtless, and it only takes a few minutes for a small error to cause a panicked response and become fatal.\n\n Calling CPS is better than the guilt you would feel if something bad happened.", "I know and I already regret my decision, But they are fine they went to school this morning, grandma picked them up and they are eating at my house. I'll go home and apologize to them directly.", "Cheers; hope you find a solution that works for you. It's a hard spot to stand in!", "Just about to get my own place and straight up block my Sil number and not answer phone calls from anyone anymore, If they need me they can text me, If I like what I read I will respond.
