You got away, made yourself a new life, and your parents were disappointed but apparently did not decide to pretend you did not exist or needed to be killed. Their church put a lot of effort into teaching parents that if their child grows up and strays it was because they were bad parents who failed in their duty.

Talk with them a bit about how you feel, about how you wish you could be yourself more around them and feel more valued as a person and not just an idealized version they have in their heads, and how that would feel like more genuine love.
