Sounds like this was your \"declaratiion of independence\". You weren't serious about them paying your bills. You were making the point that you're a self-supporting adult and they aren't in charge of you anymore.  At age 27 it's about time they accepted that. Also, they might be better representatives of their faith if they stop lying about you.", "Haha. NTA. one way to deal with it.

They better pay for it then", "YTA in that you were being an asshole; but you were being an asshole in a way that is both very funny and well deserved. The \"polite\" thing to do would be to just set a boundary, you chose instead to fuck with them, but I certainly can't fault you for it seems like they had it coming, and seems like it drove the point home.", "Nta what a genius way of putting them in their place", "NTA\n\nI'm glad you stood up for yourself and GF.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I will just say that they cannot afford my mortgage and car note.  Much less everything else.", "I agree.  OP is not in the wrong here, they just chose to take the conversation one step farther instead of just saying \"you do you and I'll do me\".  It's a jerk move, but I understand it.

What percentage of people raised in a culturally distinctive environment grow up and leave it? A huge number. Different groups teach their adherents to handle it in different ways. Some religious groups would have sentenced you to death (some would only if you were female), and some would have told your family to think of you as dead, and others are taught to shun anyone who leaves. You got away, made yourself a new life, and your parents were disappointed but apparently did not decide to pretend you did not exist or needed to be killed. Their church put a lot of effort into teaching parents that if their child grows up and strays it was because they were bad parents who failed in their duty. Now that you are an independent adult you can reconstruct a relationship on your terms and help them feel at least a bit less guilty and inadequate by their cult standards.", "Yes, YTAH, your 27 and aren't married and a college graduate, you can pay your own bills.

But not ideal. \n\nThe question I would ask myself is, would it help be a reality check for them? Or is needlessly inflammatory and mostly just about being cathartic? Everyone has things in the back of their head that would feel really great to say in the moment, especially to family, but they aren\u2019t always good ideas. \n\nI would first consider a more emotionally targeted talk with the parents that could lead to greater understanding all around. Talk with them a bit about how you feel, about how you wish you could be yourself more around them and feel more valued as a person and not just an idealized version they have in their heads, and how that would feel like more genuine love. See how they respond. I think allowing yourself to be emotionally vulnerable has a better chance of improving the relationship for everyone. \n\nI\u2019d try that, and then if they still are being difficult, then maybe it would be more appropriate to make a point somehow.", "NTA!!
