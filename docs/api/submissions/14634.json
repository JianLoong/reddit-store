Sounds like this was your \"declaratiion of independence\". You weren't serious about them paying your bills. You were making the point that you're a self-supporting adult and they aren't in charge of you anymore.  At age 27 it's about time they accepted that. Also, they might be better representatives of their faith if they stop lying about you.", "Haha. NTA. one way to deal with it. But out of curiosity, what would you have done if they agreed?", "NTA you handled that perfectly", "NTA. \n\nAlso... perfect clapback.  Bravo OP.", "NTA Speak the truth and shame the devil. Apparently, they raised you to be a liar and when you wouldn't lie for their comfort/convenience it upset them.", "NTA, that was actually really well done, lies always come to light, you just sped up the process.", "NTA sounds like they are trying to do that to you in a way and you clapped back.", "NTA, you did the correct thing.\n\nSet your boundaries, and stick to them.", "NTA as long as your gf wasn't hurt by it/knew you weren't serious.", "NTA and wonderful swerve from the post title.

What would you have done if they called your bluff and paid your bills?  Ready to throw away the gf and get religion?", "NTA\n\nThey want to dictate your life? They better pay for it then", "YTA in that you were being an asshole; but you were being an asshole in a way that is both very funny and well deserved. The \"polite\" thing to do would be to just set a boundary, you chose instead to fuck with them, but I certainly can't fault you for it seems like they had it coming, and seems like it drove the point home.", "Nta what a genius way of putting them in their place", "NTA\n\nI'm glad you stood up for yourself and GF.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They might be willing to dip into savings to finance a month or two - just long enough to destroy your relationship with your gf."]}
