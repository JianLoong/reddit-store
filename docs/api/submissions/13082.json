She has no insurance, no savings, no retirement, and is now In a condition where working is no longer an option.

She is currently living with the oldest sister with her(mother's) boyfriend who is much older than her.  \n\nAlright onto the situation. \n\nMy sister in law Is nearly thirty, and has been taking care of mother In law for years now, in turn, Mother in law watches Sister in law kids. MiL is basically bed bound, and whenever she goes anywhere, she takes a wheelchair because her legs are old and can no longer support her weight. She can still walk short distances, and is able to clean up after herself, as I've seen her do it once.\n\nAt our last get-together last year, Sister in law said she was trying to move house and that it'll be my husband and I's turn to take care of his mother. I flat out said 'no'. \n\nMy reasoning for saying no is as follows: \nA. His mother is jehovah's witness; I am a practicing wiccan and belong to the satanic temple. \nB. His mother does not clean up after herself and expects others to do it for her. \nC. She pulled a stunt at my husband and i's wedding and that him very low contact with her. \nD. She's recently getting back into drinking and drugs. (She used to do pills and other drugs, even while she was pregnant) \n\nEdit note: all but two of the 5 siblings are low or no contact with MIL for different reasons \n\nThe conversation ended at that, but Sister in law sounded a bit upset that I had said no. \n\nFast forward to around Sunday or Monday this week, and my husband gets a call from his sister. The call lasts about four hours or so, and Sister in law had obviously been drinking and had said as much as well. \n\nThough this wasn't the main reason for the call, she started to talk about how she's the only one that can take care of mother in law and how she won't be able to do anything (get married, move, ect) until their mother is dead. \n\nMy husband tried to reiterate our reasons for not taking her, but his sister kept saying, \"I'm the only one that can handle it.\" \n\nI know she's just stressed and depressed, and I'm not in any way upset at her at all. She deserves to be able to do whatever she wants with her life. She is honestly an amazing person, but I know her mother is guilting her into taking care of her. \n\nI still can't help but feel I'm the asshole because I won't even consider taking My mother in law in.

It's a terrible situation, but you are not obligated to be a part of it. Maybe some sort of a fund could be established between all the siblings? \n\nAlso, some kind of social service should be available for her, even if she spent her life off the grid and under the table. She still has a social security number, right?", "NTA, but your husband needs to get a meeting of all of the siblings together, and come up with a plan for his mother. \n\nTaking care of his mother shouldn't be your responsibly, but neither should it be his sister's.

That may be a home, that may be some kind of monetary exchange so the current sister can get some in-home help in exchange for continuing to house MIL. As a spouse, I think being in the room for that discussion would be helpful, but not vital. Let them figure it out. Your husband sounds like he is holding strong against the move in idea, do whatever you can to show him support in holding firm. He\u2019s going to take the brunt of SIL\u2019s ire.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is LC for a reason moving her in would violate that reason. Its time to look at a care facility for MiL. SiL cannot continue to lokk after her and it seems like nobody else is willing to step up.", "NTA. All the reasons that you listed are very valid. Also, she is your HUSBAND'S mother, and your husband clearly has been having LC with his mother anyway. Also, where are the rest of the siblings? The four of them?", "NTA\n\nYour MIL\u2019s condition is her own doing. The same can be said about your SIL. It is not yours or MIL\u2019s children\u2019s responsibility to handle what MIL should\u2019ve handled throughout her life. SIL made the choice to take care of her thus putting her life on hold. All she has to do is stop", "NTA. You have valid reasons for not wanting to take care of your mother-in-law, including your religious differences, her cleanliness habits, her behavior at your wedding, and her recent issues with substance abuse. It's not fair for your sister-in-law to guilt you into taking care of her, especially when she has been taking care of her for years. It's important to set boundaries and stick to them, and it sounds like you and your husband have already done that. It's understandable that your sister-in-law is stressed and depressed, but that doesn't mean she can pressure you into taking on a responsibility that you're not comfortable with.", "NTA - this is too complicated of a situation though for this sub. Those involved need to sit down with a low income housing counselor and disability coordinator and figure out a solution that doesn\u2019t involve her living off family members. This is especially true if there are addiction issues. A disability counselor will assist her with her taxes, and if she is uncooperative, depending on the state, may also be eligible for a mental health hold.", "NTA. She is not your mother, and you do not owe her anything. But your husband and his siblings need to work something out, even if that something is a Care Home. It's not your job AT ALL, but it is (kinda) your husband's. Not for his mother's sake, but for his sister's.", "Nah except for mil, she's ah\n\nIt isn't your responsibility, or your sil\"s responsibility to pause your entire lives for mil. She dug herself a hole and is trying to pull everyone around her down into it.", "NAH\n\nYou're right to not want your MIL and your SIL is right to be tired of it all.\n\n\nIf your MIL doesn't have any funds, is public housing and medicaid (if you're in the US ) and option? It will take a long time, but it at least gives a light at the end of the tunnel. She needs to talk to someone in regards to the taxes and whatnot, to get her mother on track to get assistance. However, at the end of the day, children shouldn't be their parent's retirement plans and MIL needs to figure herself out.\n\nEncourage your SIL to gain her independence and maintain yours.", "NTA. So MIL and her boyfriend are living with your SIL? That's a crappy situation for your SIL. \n\nCall the Council on Aging or elder services in your community. Don't assume there isn't services available for MIL. Even if someone comes in help one day a week it's a break for SIL.", "NTA  ... She needs to file an Indigent claim on her mother and have her admitted to a care home. She's enabling her. If that means kicking her out then so be it. \n\nSIL needs to move. Tell her mother we are moving on X date and she will need to find her own accommodation at that time as there is not room for her to move with SIL. If that means she's homeless then that's her own fault", "NTA. SIL needs to call social services.", "Clearly NTA at all! And all the reasons you listed are not even necessary, just the fact that you don't want to or don't feel like it, should be enough.\n\n>she's the only one that can take care of mother in law and how she won't be able to do anything (get married, move, ect) until their mother is dead. \n\nNot true. This is actually a choice that SIL makes to make it her own problem, when it's really not. MIL is a grown adult that should take care of herself, or get professional paid help if she needs that. I understand her daughter wants to help, but this is definitely NOT normal or healthy that her life should be \"on hold\" because taking care of mother comes before everything else.\n\nPlease talk to your SIL and tell her this is not normal, and that it's an unhealthy and unwise choice to sacrifice her own life and wellbeing to facilitate mom. I think SIL doesn't realize this and is just afraid that mom will be without care if you guys don't take over. That's wrong because there are other options. And if mom chooses to ignore those options, that's on her.", "NTA\n\nDo not agree to have her come stay with you. Your MIL is bedbound. If your sister is no longer able to care for her, next time she is ill with anything, take her to the ER. I know this sounds awful, but legally they cannot discharge a patient to you if you state you are not able to care for them. Do not come to pick her up and do not agree to have her discharged back to your house. So if your SIL says she can't stay with her because she is not able to care for her, the hospital social workers will have to find someplace (a nursing home or similar) that will take her, likely on Medicaid.", "NTA, the mil is for refusing to file what she needs to in order to get services. Even if she owed die to non filing, it wouldn't exempt her from qualifying for services. They would take a small percentage until she was paid in full. \nI mean, it seems like she's being enabled and allowed to avoid responsibility, and your poor sil deserves better.", "This is too complicated a situation for this sub. Your husband & his mom & his mom\u2019s other kids have to come up with a better solution for mom\u2019s care. It\u2019s not fair to stick SIL with the sole care of their mother, & the other kids can\u2019t just say, \u201cnot it\u201d unless they\u2019re good with putting mom on the street. \n\nSome contradictions in your post: mom is bed bound yet she watches SIL\u2019s kids. How? She is bed bound or in a wheelchair & yet no one can control her access to drugs. You complain that she doesn\u2019t clean up after herself- it seems like it would be hard for a bed bound person to make much of a mess & difficult for a wheelchair bound person to do much cleaning.", "MIL doesn\u2019t get any aide or benefits? is this in the US?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
