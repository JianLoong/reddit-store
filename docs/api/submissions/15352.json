It's a studio apartment so most of the people who live in the same building are single. Most of the people I've seen here are around my age but there's one lady who is a bit older( let's call her Ann). The rate of unemployment is very high in my country so most people don't have the luxury of being picky about jobs. I work in a company that takes 15 hrs of my day ( 7am - 10pm). I only have one off day per week which depends on how much work there is. My work schedule makes it difficult for me to spend much time in my house. It's like I just go there to shower and sleep then go back to work. I've never had much interaction with my neighbours even when I was still in school. I just say hi when we come across each other and leave it at that. Last month Ann came knocking on my door at around 11:30 pm. She started asking me why her bf comes to my house. I was shocked coz I've never seen the said bf and I'm rarely in my house. I told her I don't know what she was talking about. She asked for my phone to check if we've ever communicated but she didn't find his number on it. I thought that was the end of it. A few days later she came just after I got home. It was my off day and I had gone shopping. She said that someone told her that they saw her bf come to my house. I asked her to come in and check but she didn't find him. The third time she came with the same accusation I just told her to leave me alone coz I don't know what she keeps talking about. She started coming out of her house anytime she heard me touch my door just to confirm that I was not with her bf. I live directly opposite her. She came to my door yesterday at midnight and started going off about how I'm a husband snatcher, how I bring different men to my house yet I pretend to be so reserved, started accusing me of smoking weed ( weed is illegal in my country). I had just come back from work and didn't have the energy to deal with her so I put on some music and ignored her. She started pounding on my door hurling all types of insults calling me a whore and such. After some time I was fed up so I opened my door and told her that her agemates were busy doing something with their lives, spending time with their families while she's here trying to pick a fight with someone who is half her age over a bf I've never even seen. That seemed to catch her by suprise. She called me a bitch and went back to her house. I called my mum and told her about it and she said I shouldn't have told her that coz I don't know anything about her. She said should try to move to another apartment instead. I now feel a bit bad for what I said but it seemed to work coz the neighbour didn't open her door to confirm if I was alone when I left in the morning.

She is dangerous. Write down every interaction; date, time, what she said and did, etc. See if you can report her to the police now for harassment. Also report everything to the landlord. She ideally needs to be evicted. Look over your rental agreement to see if anything can help you get her evicted and hold your landlord to anything in your contract.
