{"id": 8390, "submission_id": "10mbns1", "title": "WIBTA for pulling out of a family vacation if my dog can't go?", "selftext": " Background: My BIL Thomas has really bad OCD, especially regarding his daughter (Ellie - 1) and our dog (2 yr old lab - Bella). After his daughter was born, we all found out that he has really bad issues with germs. He's super careful with sanitizing and limiting germ exposure. For example, if they go out to eat, he spends like 20 minutes wiping down the high chair before letting Ellie sit in it, or if she goes to the playground, he changes her clothes right when they get home. We have a dog who we view as our child. Thomas hates bringing Ellie around our dog because of the germs. Whenever we get together for family dinners, he used to just hold Ellie, or make us lock Bella up in a different part of the house so that Ellie could run around. He's starting to realize that that isn't sustainable, so he's slowly becoming more comfortable with Ellie running around while Bella is around. To clarify, Bella mostly leaves Ellie alone. Even though he's slowly warming up to it, he still refuses to come to our house because of Bella, and even asked us to leave Bella at home when we got together for Christmas (we said no, she's family).\n\nThe story: My husband (Bobby) really wants to go on a trip with his family this summer to a lake. We talked it over with his parents and decided to rent a houseboat and my FIL said he would take care of the cost of the houseboat and us kids were going to split the gas. Bobby was talking to his sister (Amber - Thomas\u2019 wife) today and she mentioned that Thomas had said that if Bella is going, they're not. I guess Thomas is worried about Ellie and Bella being in such close quarters with each other and is worried about Bella accidentally hurting Ellie (the example he gave was Bella accidentally pushing Ellie off the boat). Bobby tried talking with her and she's going to talk to Thomas and see if we can convince him that everyone involved will be safe (there are guardrails on the boat so no one can accidentally go overboard) and make sure he knows that both Bella and Ellie will be under constant supervision, especially when they're together. Not only that, but we want to do some training with Bella and Ellie in the next couple months before the trip to make sure they are comfortable around each other, since they really don't have a chance to be with each other without Thomas intervening.\n\nThere is an extra fee of $30/day for pets that we're planning on paying, which is a lot cheaper than if we were to put her in a pet hotel for the trip. And we don't have any other family or friends that can watch her either. So besides just wanting to bring her because she would have so much fun, it's also easier (and cheaper) for us to bring her with.\n\nBobby is worried that his dad is going to tell us not to bring Bella so that Amber and Thomas will come on the trip, and I told Bobby that he should tell his dad that if Bella isn't coming, then neither are we, which might make us the AH. So, WIBTA if we say we're not going if Bella can't come?\n\nETA: I mentioned this in a comment, but we do have a 4month old human baby as well as the 2 year old dog. So there is no jealousy that they have a baby and we don\u2019t, or a lack of understanding about having a dog and baby together in the same space.", "created_utc": 1674792413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mbns1/wibta_for_pulling_out_of_a_family_vacation_if_my/", "score": 383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your brother-in-law doesn't want to go with the dog, that's his decision. If your father-in-law and mother-in-law are paying for the trip, then it's reasonable for them to ask a dog not to go. Especially if it means they get to take the trip with their grandchild. I know your dog is like a child to you, but that doesn't mean it is to everyone else and that everyone else has to act accordingly. In your own home is one thing, but this is a joint vacation you're all agreeing to take together.", "NAH unless you push for having Bella on the boat. I love my dog and hate traveling without her, but I also accept that not everyone likes dogs and some people are varying levels of fearful around them. If I have to bow out of something because someone isn't comfortable around my dog that's fine - it's part of what I signed up for when I got her! My desire to have her there does not outweigh someone else's comfort. It sounds like Bobby is trying very hard to be more comfortable with Bella, and with Ellie being around Bella. That's awesome of him, and something that is going to take time.\n\nIn this specific situation, I think this might be setting everyone up for failure though. Being on a houseboat is very tight quarters unless you're also going to be on Below Deck, so I can't blame Bobby for being anxious about this. Ideally, both Bella and Ellie would be watched 24/7. Realistically, that situation is honestly something that I would never consider. All it takes is one moment of either Ellie or Bella behaving badly and the other lashes out, and even without injuries any budding trust is broken. Similarly, even if they're getting along well, if someone gets distracted both Ellie and or Bella can get injured easily, and water isn't a great surrounding for that situation", "Why don\u2019t you let Bobby go and you stay home with the dog?", "Info: how does the dog use the bathroom on a boat? Has your dog been on a boat for that long? How will the dog get daily exercise?", "Gonna be honest. No one but you guys wants your dog around at every single family trip and event.

And frankly plenty of people, OCD and young child or not, don't want to spend a week with someone elses dog running about.

I would buy and gift Ellie a Type II life jacket for safety and bathe your dog the day before the trip (no one likes a stinky dog). Teach Bella the \u201cplace\u201d command so that she learns that she needs to stay in a designated place should she need to be out of the way. Beyond this, what more can you do?

As I\u2019ve said before, and as someone else on the post already replied, you cannot play along with the obsessions of someone with OCD. Yes, it is very prevalent in my family. Yes, more than one counselor and a psychiatrist have told us the same thing. Thomas needs to take responsibility for his obsessions. If he is not seeing a therapist and a doctor for meds, he should be. If he is, he needs to use his coping techniques.\n\nTaking a dog that has always been welcome by the family on a family trip to a lake is not unreasonable.

Thomas doesn\u2019t have an issue with the dog itself. He\u2019ll play with her and mess around with her,  he just gets worried about his daughter being around her, which I do understand. He also has a hard time with the germ side of things and we\u2019ve been told that\u2019s why he won\u2019t bring Ellie to our house. \n2. Bobby and I have a kid ourselves, a 4 month old baby. So it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. \n3. When we first discussed the idea with the family, we made it clear that we wanted to bring the dog and no one said anything about it. It was after the fact when Bobby and Amber were talking about it that she brought up that Thomas had said they weren\u2019t going if the dog was. \n4. Bobby and I have talked about leaving Bella at a pet hotel, but it\u2019s almost double the cost of what it would be to bring her with and we really don\u2019t have that kind of money. \n5. We\u2019re getting a boat with 3 rooms, so all of us will have our own room. The dog is excitable, but she\u2019s a total sweetheart.  We want to do some training with her and Ellie before the trip to get them used to being in close quarters with each other. \n6. Thomas is in therapy and recently started medication for his OCD. He recognizes that there is a problem and has been working on it and he\u2019s been doing great so far. Everyone in the family has noticed improvements and we are super proud of him for it. \n\nI guess my bottom line is that I\u2019m not sure where the line is between enabling his OCD behaviors but also being respectful to his decisions. At the end of the day, we don\u2019t want there to be any negative feelings on this trip, so we\u2019re hoping to come up with a solution that works for everyone, even if it means the trip doesn\u2019t happen.", "So this dog is just going to piss and shit all over this boat for a week? YTA", "I would say soft YTA, bc the dog was there first and you value it as much as a kid. If it\u2019s not aggressive, your brother honestly is keeping them apart for the wrong reasons, he\u2019s probably gonna do more harm to his kid\u2019s immune system cleaning her environment like that so young (given that I don\u2019t know how clean you keep your dog). However, YTA for wanting to bring Bella on a boat where Ellie\u2019s family is also invited, since Bella has already accidentally pushed ellie off of a boat before. I was fully on your side before that pint and my stomach flipped. A toddler getting knocked into any water but especially the side of a boat is incredibly dangerous even if they know how to swim. Ellie can be gentle and safe with kids, but it sounds like she didn\u2019t even mean to. It\u2019s not fair to want to bring a sweet but bumbling being into an area where it has already endangered another being.", "YTA.

The best way to help the guy with OCD is to treat them just like anyone else and don't change your actions to accommodate their OCD.

I've never known a dog that hasn't indulged in coprophagy (I like your phrasing lol) at some point and if we take your concern as expressed you'd have to lump every dog into it because they are known to do that and how could you be sure any dog is clean enough.  So the only solution would to make sure you're never around a dog, ever.  As to the dog and the child on the boat together, why are we assuming the dog is the hazard here?  You're catastrophizing.  Think of it this way.  An argument could be made that a toddler is less conscious about safety on a boat than a dog.  The risk could not be just the dog and the toddler being there together, but the toddler being there.  And why is the dog a greater risk than the adults?  They are larger and an accident involving an adult human would be more likely to propel the toddler than one with a dog.  These are all risks, *everything* in life is a risk.  The question is are these risks to the level that the only solution is to not bring the dog?  I'd say no for me, a lifejacket on the child, which is reasonable for anyone on a boat, would certainly suffice.  Everyone has different levels of risk tolerance and that's fine, but OCD twists *everything* and those with it can lose the ability to accept *any* perceived risk and even be able to discern different levels of risk.", "I agree with that.

OCD is an irrational disorder, so even if Thomas sees reason in this proposal it might still be difficult to get him to agree to it, but I hope that all of you can work something out.", "I'm anything but OCD, lamentably my SO might say, and have some familiarity with managing risk through eliminating or mitigating unnecessary risks to achieve an otherwise risky but high value goal.  In this case, the goal is having the toddler safely aboard with the other humans; the unnecessary risk is the dog, who does not understand physics nor has any particular interest in the child's well-being.  It's not just about the danger of immersion, btw, but also of wave/wake action coupled with erratic dog movements propelling the already unsteady child into hard surfaces.\n\nAs for the coprophagy, not ever having a dog around my face or food is perfectly acceptable...highly desired in fact.  Kids like dogs, usually, so one has to be comfortable with some level of that sort of interaction, but there's no reason to encourage it.  It doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing scenario.", "[removed]", "All fair points.  If you were the one requesting the dog not come for those reasons I'd have no issue with it.  My risk tolerance may be different than yours in those instances but yours aren't irrational and if that's what you wanted that's fine.  Just going off of the OPs post I'm not granting the same acceptance of the reasoning because the OCD appears to be the driver.  You are correct in saying that those concerns could be valid but I'd also have to take into account the person with the concerns.  I admit I'm not impartial on this topic either as I have diagnosed OCD and tend to see situations like this through a different lens than other people.  It is just too easy to escalate an obsession when even a small concession is made when dealing with OCD and I have spent years training myself to never give it an inch.  It may make me seem somewhat inflexible when the topic is breached and I mean no insult to the points you made.", "[removed]", "I understand and appreciate the discussion and your POV.  It is difficult sussing out where the OCD ends and legitimate concerns begin, if indeed they ever even do begin for him.  I had not given sufficient weight to that latter possibility and am glad you raised it.", "To be honest, I think that in this case it would be a matter of needing more information. I have OCD too including around \"contamination\" and minimizing safety hazards and such, all of which dogs play into, but I also am not fond of dogs in general because they vast majority of them are sensory nightmares (I'm autistic) and I have a history of trauma with them (to the point that I used to be actually phobic of them, managed to work through it, and can now even interact with dogs I know well and I do like those ones).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo somebody who only knows about my OCD and not about my autism and trauma might think that a similar situation to the one OP describes involving me would just be a concession to OCD, but it might be more. For what it's worth, the cultural mindset that everyone should be happy around dogs even if they don't have trauma, OCD, etc. is kind of exhausting, some people just don't like dogs and shouldn't be vilified for it, especially on a vacation where accommodations will have to be made for dogs.", "Oh shoot.
