{"id": 8390, "submission_id": "10mbns1", "title": "WIBTA for pulling out of a family vacation if my dog can't go?", "selftext": " Background: My BIL Thomas has really bad OCD, especially regarding his daughter (Ellie - 1) and our dog (2 yr old lab - Bella). After his daughter was born, we all found out that he has really bad issues with germs. He's super careful with sanitizing and limiting germ exposure. For example, if they go out to eat, he spends like 20 minutes wiping down the high chair before letting Ellie sit in it, or if she goes to the playground, he changes her clothes right when they get home. We have a dog who we view as our child. Thomas hates bringing Ellie around our dog because of the germs. Whenever we get together for family dinners, he used to just hold Ellie, or make us lock Bella up in a different part of the house so that Ellie could run around. He's starting to realize that that isn't sustainable, so he's slowly becoming more comfortable with Ellie running around while Bella is around. To clarify, Bella mostly leaves Ellie alone. Even though he's slowly warming up to it, he still refuses to come to our house because of Bella, and even asked us to leave Bella at home when we got together for Christmas (we said no, she's family).\n\nThe story: My husband (Bobby) really wants to go on a trip with his family this summer to a lake. We talked it over with his parents and decided to rent a houseboat and my FIL said he would take care of the cost of the houseboat and us kids were going to split the gas. Bobby was talking to his sister (Amber - Thomas\u2019 wife) today and she mentioned that Thomas had said that if Bella is going, they're not. I guess Thomas is worried about Ellie and Bella being in such close quarters with each other and is worried about Bella accidentally hurting Ellie (the example he gave was Bella accidentally pushing Ellie off the boat). Bobby tried talking with her and she's going to talk to Thomas and see if we can convince him that everyone involved will be safe (there are guardrails on the boat so no one can accidentally go overboard) and make sure he knows that both Bella and Ellie will be under constant supervision, especially when they're together. Not only that, but we want to do some training with Bella and Ellie in the next couple months before the trip to make sure they are comfortable around each other, since they really don't have a chance to be with each other without Thomas intervening.\n\nThere is an extra fee of $30/day for pets that we're planning on paying, which is a lot cheaper than if we were to put her in a pet hotel for the trip. And we don't have any other family or friends that can watch her either. So besides just wanting to bring her because she would have so much fun, it's also easier (and cheaper) for us to bring her with.\n\nBobby is worried that his dad is going to tell us not to bring Bella so that Amber and Thomas will come on the trip, and I told Bobby that he should tell his dad that if Bella isn't coming, then neither are we, which might make us the AH. So, WIBTA if we say we're not going if Bella can't come?\n\nETA: I mentioned this in a comment, but we do have a 4month old human baby as well as the 2 year old dog. So there is no jealousy that they have a baby and we don\u2019t, or a lack of understanding about having a dog and baby together in the same space.", "created_utc": 1674792413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mbns1/wibta_for_pulling_out_of_a_family_vacation_if_my/", "score": 6602, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your brother-in-law doesn't want to go with the dog, that's his decision. If your father-in-law and mother-in-law are paying for the trip, then it's reasonable for them to ask a dog not to go. Especially if it means they get to take the trip with their grandchild.

I love my dog and hate traveling without her, but I also accept that not everyone likes dogs and some people are varying levels of fearful around them. If I have to bow out of something because someone isn't comfortable around my dog that's fine - it's part of what I signed up for when I got her! My desire to have her there does not outweigh someone else's comfort. It sounds like Bobby is trying very hard to be more comfortable with Bella, and with Ellie being around Bella. That's awesome of him, and something that is going to take time.\n\nIn this specific situation, I think this might be setting everyone up for failure though. Being on a houseboat is very tight quarters unless you're also going to be on Below Deck, so I can't blame Bobby for being anxious about this. Ideally, both Bella and Ellie would be watched 24/7. Realistically, that situation is honestly something that I would never consider. All it takes is one moment of either Ellie or Bella behaving badly and the other lashes out, and even without injuries any budding trust is broken. Similarly, even if they're getting along well, if someone gets distracted both Ellie and or Bella can get injured easily, and water isn't a great surrounding for that situation", "Why don\u2019t you let Bobby go and you stay home with the dog?\n\nEdit: the OP has edited her comment that she has a baby of her own.  I\u2019m that case I suggest they bite the bullet and pay to board the dog.   \n\nI have a dog too and sometimes that\u2019s what you need to do, I rented a house once with friends and one was allergic, and that\u2019s life we boarded him.", "Info: how does the dog use the bathroom on a boat?

That way there's more space for all the kids things, babies on a boat won't be a factor and dog can have space/ won't need to be in everyone else's.", "Gonna be honest. No one but you guys wants your dog around at every single family trip and event. She\u2019s a pet, not a child, obviously grandparents would rather their grandkid came than your dog.

I would buy and gift Ellie a Type II life jacket for safety and bathe your dog the day before the trip (no one likes a stinky dog). Teach Bella the \u201cplace\u201d command so that she learns that she needs to stay in a designated place should she need to be out of the way. Beyond this, what more can you do?

As I\u2019ve said before, and as someone else on the post already replied, you cannot play along with the obsessions of someone with OCD. Yes, it is very prevalent in my family. Yes, more than one counselor and a psychiatrist have told us the same thing. Thomas needs to take responsibility for his obsessions. If he is not seeing a therapist and a doctor for meds, he should be. If he is, he needs to use his coping techniques.\n\nTaking a dog that has always been welcome by the family on a family trip to a lake is not unreasonable.

Thomas doesn\u2019t have an issue with the dog itself. He\u2019ll play with her and mess around with her,  he just gets worried about his daughter being around her, which I do understand. He also has a hard time with the germ side of things and we\u2019ve been told that\u2019s why he won\u2019t bring Ellie to our house. \n2. Bobby and I have a kid ourselves, a 4 month old baby. So it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. \n3. When we first discussed the idea with the family, we made it clear that we wanted to bring the dog and no one said anything about it. It was after the fact when Bobby and Amber were talking about it that she brought up that Thomas had said they weren\u2019t going if the dog was. \n4. Bobby and I have talked about leaving Bella at a pet hotel, but it\u2019s almost double the cost of what it would be to bring her with and we really don\u2019t have that kind of money. \n5. We\u2019re getting a boat with 3 rooms, so all of us will have our own room. The dog is excitable, but she\u2019s a total sweetheart.  We want to do some training with her and Ellie before the trip to get them used to being in close quarters with each other. \n6. Thomas is in therapy and recently started medication for his OCD. He recognizes that there is a problem and has been working on it and he\u2019s been doing great so far. Everyone in the family has noticed improvements and we are super proud of him for it. \n\nI guess my bottom line is that I\u2019m not sure where the line is between enabling his OCD behaviors but also being respectful to his decisions. At the end of the day, we don\u2019t want there to be any negative feelings on this trip, so we\u2019re hoping to come up with a solution that works for everyone, even if it means the trip doesn\u2019t happen.", "So this dog is just going to piss and shit all over this boat for a week? YTA", "I would say soft YTA, bc the dog was there first and you value it as much as a kid. If it\u2019s not aggressive, your brother honestly is keeping them apart for the wrong reasons, he\u2019s probably gonna do more harm to his kid\u2019s immune system cleaning her environment like that so young (given that I don\u2019t know how clean you keep your dog). However, YTA for wanting to bring Bella on a boat where Ellie\u2019s family is also invited, since Bella has already accidentally pushed ellie off of a boat before. I was fully on your side before that pint and my stomach flipped. A toddler getting knocked into any water but especially the side of a boat is incredibly dangerous even if they know how to swim. Ellie can be gentle and safe with kids, but it sounds like she didn\u2019t even mean to. It\u2019s not fair to want to bring a sweet but bumbling being into an area where it has already endangered another being.", "YTA.

The best way to help the guy with OCD is to treat them just like anyone else and don't change your actions to accommodate their OCD.

So the only solution would to make sure you're never around a dog, ever.  As to the dog and the child on the boat together, why are we assuming the dog is the hazard here?  You're catastrophizing.  Think of it this way.  An argument could be made that a toddler is less conscious about safety on a boat than a dog.  The risk could not be just the dog and the toddler being there together, but the toddler being there.  And why is the dog a greater risk than the adults?  They are larger and an accident involving an adult human would be more likely to propel the toddler than one with a dog.  These are all risks, *everything* in life is a risk.  The question is are these risks to the level that the only solution is to not bring the dog?  I'd say no for me, a lifejacket on the child, which is reasonable for anyone on a boat, would certainly suffice.

OCD is an irrational disorder, so even if Thomas sees reason in this proposal it might still be difficult to get him to agree to it, but I hope that all of you can work something out.", "I'm anything but OCD, lamentably my SO might say, and have some familiarity with managing risk through eliminating or mitigating unnecessary risks to achieve an otherwise risky but high value goal.  In this case, the goal is having the toddler safely aboard with the other humans; the unnecessary risk is the dog, who does not understand physics nor has any particular interest in the child's well-being.  It's not just about the danger of immersion, btw, but also of wave/wake action coupled with erratic dog movements propelling the already unsteady child into hard surfaces.\n\nAs for the coprophagy, not ever having a dog around my face or food is perfectly acceptable...highly desired in fact.  Kids like dogs, usually, so one has to be comfortable with some level of that sort of interaction, but there's no reason to encourage it.

My risk tolerance may be different than yours in those instances but yours aren't irrational and if that's what you wanted that's fine.  Just going off of the OPs post I'm not granting the same acceptance of the reasoning because the OCD appears to be the driver.  You are correct in saying that those concerns could be valid but I'd also have to take into account the person with the concerns.  I admit I'm not impartial on this topic either as I have diagnosed OCD and tend to see situations like this through a different lens than other people.  It is just too easy to escalate an obsession when even a small concession is made when dealing with OCD and I have spent years training myself to never give it an inch.  It may make me seem somewhat inflexible when the topic is breached and I mean no insult to the points you made.", "[removed]", "I understand and appreciate the discussion and your POV.  It is difficult sussing out where the OCD ends and legitimate concerns begin, if indeed they ever even do begin for him.

I have OCD too including around \"contamination\" and minimizing safety hazards and such, all of which dogs play into, but I also am not fond of dogs in general because they vast majority of them are sensory nightmares (I'm autistic) and I have a history of trauma with them (to the point that I used to be actually phobic of them, managed to work through it, and can now even interact with dogs I know well and I do like those ones).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo somebody who only knows about my OCD and not about my autism and trauma might think that a similar situation to the one OP describes involving me would just be a concession to OCD, but it might be more. For what it's worth, the cultural mindset that everyone should be happy around dogs even if they don't have trauma, OCD, etc. is kind of exhausting, some people just don't like dogs and shouldn't be vilified for it, especially on a vacation where accommodations will have to be made for dogs.", "Oh shoot.

Let us know what you guys decide to do?\n\nPersonally, I'd give up a lot NOT to be locked into close quarters in the situation you describe, and isn't that the nature of a houseboat?\n\nEdit:  INFO - what breed of dog, is it a water lover? \n\n(Originally the first line of the post, it was cut off when I tried to acknowledge Snelliepoo's comment about dogs on houseboats.)", "Okay, other things to address after reading comments:\n- Leave me alone about not mentioning my own kid in the original post. There\u2019s a character limit and when I first tried to post this, with the mention of my kid, I exceeded the character limit and had to repost. I had to edit this a few times to get it within the limit and the only time I mentioned my baby in my original post was at the very beginning when I gave background on who all was going on the trip. My husband has another brother going to, but the only people involved in the current issue is me, my husband, my dog, my BIL, SIL, niece, and FIL. \n- To clarify all who is going it\u2019s: my MIL, FIL, my husband\u2019s sister, her husband, and their daughter, my husband\u2019s brother, my husband, me, our baby, and possibly our dog. So 7 adults, 2 babies, and a dog. I know, it\u2019s a lot. All names are made up. \n- We have a ski boat that seats 6 people (babies are included in that, even if they\u2019re lap sitting, per state law) that we are bringing. The dog has been on that boat before and loves it!\n- We did talk about either camping or staying at a lodge on shore in addition to the houseboat, but everyone going decided on the houseboat. It\u2019s a big lake (I\u2019d specify which one but I\u2019m trying to keep this somewhat anonymous). The lake in question though is drying up, so it\u2019s not like we can really wait until another year to go. The reason for the houseboat is that there are sights to see that are about 50 miles from any marina, so unless we want to spend 4 hours round trip on our little boat that 3 people will have to sit out of anyway, the houseboat is the only way for everyone to participate. \n- My husband\u2019s original idea when he brought this trip up to his dad was that everyone involved (3 couples plus his single brother) would split the cost of the boat and gas evenly and we would pay the extra fee for the dog. My FIL decided to pay for the houseboat entirely and just us kids would pay for the gas and we would still pay the pet fee. \n- We are getting a bigger houseboat because we have such a large group going.  We\u2019re getting one with 3 rooms, sleeps 10 people. All 3 couples will have their own room (dog will sleep in our room with us) and my single BIL will sleep on the couch (he has agreed to this)\n- I in no way want to downplay my sympathy towards my BIL\u2019s OCD. I understand that he can\u2019t help it. I understand that it\u2019s a serious medical issue. I myself suffer from anxiety and depression, so I understand mental health issues. My dad suffers from OCD. I get it. But everything I\u2019ve been told by my dad and my own therapist is that it is not healthy to validate unhealthy OCD behaviors. All of us, including my SIL, are concerned about the potential impacts his behaviors will have on my niece growing up. He is in therapy and he is getting help.", "INFO: does BIL have actual, diagnosed OCD, or are you characterizing his observed behaviors (wiping down high chair) as OCD?

Your baby can be held, carried in a sling, and etc, toddlers have a mind of their own and try to do whatever they want! On top of this you have to worry about the dog going near her. I hate the idea of dogs licking my baby\u2019s face. I\u2019ll probably get down voted for this but its disgusting! I don\u2019t have OCD but I\u2019d be worried about the germs!\n\nIt won\u2019t be a holiday for your BIL, it won\u2019t be relaxing at all.\n\nHave you taken the dog on a boat before?

It annoys me to no end when family or friends feel entitled to bring a dog(s) to my, or any other persons house for a holiday or gathering.  Most of the time they do nothing to police the dog\u2018s behavior, happily enjoying themselves while other responsible persons deal with the goings on.   As others have said, the dog can be your family, but it is not to others.   \n\n\n Beyond the simple dog imposition, which I feel is the crux of this dilemma, is the inclusion of the BIL OCD and such.  It feels to me that this aspect was embellished and brought to the forefront to distract from the issue at hand, entitled \u201ddog mom.\u201d   The thought that 3 groups of people will be sharing a confined space together is already a potentially tense endeavor.  Then to have a large dog forced in as well, when many don\u2019t want to be around said dog in a more open space is just bonkers.    \n\n\nThe request that the dog be confined when that family is over is also not, in my opinion, outlandish.  As stated above, we have lots of pets and host quite often, including 18+ on thanksgiving.  We routinely stash the pets in confined area for their comfort as well as the guests, especially at the start points of commotion.    \n\n\nYou can make this your hill to die on.  And that\u2019s ok as it would be your choice in how you feel.  Just remember that others\u2019 feelings are also valid, even if they oppose yours.

You can't control them, you can't predict them, and they are not and will never be equivalent to a child. That's not a bad thing, but you can't expect anyone else to care about your dog as much as you do and you certainly can't fault a responsible parent for not wanting to let their kid around a dog they don't know well enough to trust. Has your dog ever spent extended time on a boat before? That's a pretty intensely different environment for a dog, and you can't really predict how they might behave in that kind of stressful situation unless you've done it before, and if you have, did your brother get the opportunity to see how he reacted on the boat to determine whether his behavior would be safe?", "As someone with a 5 month old baby, my dog is absolutely not my child.

He's going to have things that are pushing his limits and it sounds like he's done some amount of work on figuring out how to manage that.\n\nPart of managing it though is avoiding situations that might overwhelm you. Being a parent is anxiety-inducing enough as it is, it's hard not to be constantly worried about your kid. And when you're surrounded by family, it's easy to get distracted and suddenly the kid falls down, now they're crying, everyone is trying to help, they're surrounding you while you try to comfort your child...grandma is trying to hug her, grandpa is giving medical advice to you, your sibling is saying \"I told her not to do that\" and a cousin is trying to hide the fact that they pushed the kid.\n\nIt's chaos, and it erupts in a second. Seriously, my heart rate increased as I typed that shit up.\n\nNow add a dog in that mix, and put it all in a cramped houseboat.\n\nHoly shit, I would have a hard time not exploding at everyone and then I'd be here asking if *I* was the asshole for losing it in a situation I tried pretty hard to avoid.\n\nI've taken my dog on a family vacation before, too. It was in a huge cabin with a massive amount of room for him to run around and play in though. We had fun, and the family seemed to like it, but it was a good situation for it. We only had one under-2 child on that trip between 3 families, so we had enough manpower to handle dog and toddler needs without getting in each other's hair. We had room to step away and chill if things were getting a little crazy. Also, we actually have 3 dogs and only took the one that we knew would be manageable, the one who was more aloof and unbelievably tolerant of chaos. \n\nTHAT kind of vacation is perfect for that particular dog to come along on. \n\nI wouldn't dream of doing it on a boat though, and definitely not with a clinically anxious parent of a 1yo. That's kind of where I'm seeing the asshole behavior here.", "Yeah, I think the worst part of this arrangement is the houseboat part. I wouldn't want to be trapped in a boat with a toddler and an infant, and I'm not sure where the dog is supposed to relieve itself, unless they are frequently docked, in which case it seems like you might as well rent a house that is not a boat?

Toddler and dog running around like crazy, a little baby crying all the time. Even if the 1 year old were sleeping I couldn't relax. I'm not OCD but I would spend the whole vacation being afraid she would wander off and fall off the boat.

Or eg some one I knew with OCD had to lie awake at night and apologise for every misdeed she had ever done (**compulsion**) in order to repent other wise she would be punished (**obsession**), this was when she was around 7 before she was diagnosed. \n\nHopefully the fact that OP\u2019s BIL has started to relax with Ellie means that he is getting the mental health support that he needs. BIL is well aware that cleaning a high chair for 20 mins is excessive but he can\u2019t help himself. \n\nAnd even if BIL didn\u2019t have OCD it\u2019s not unreasonable for some one not to want a dog - *even if it\u2019s the sweetest most friendliest dog in the world* - around their child, especially an infant.

However, wouldn't the point of exposure therapy be that the person is *in control* so that they can stop when it feels overwhelming and stop it from spiralling into literally traumatic? What I'm saying is even if BIL *is* supposed to be undergoing exposure therapy, even if this is what his therapist recommends (again, good-faith) it is not OPs place to decide when or where he should be exposed and whether he should be doing it during a vacation (which is meant to be a relaxing time and not a time you spend in panic every single minute of the day). She also keeps dismissing his very valid concerns on toddler and dog on-board safety, which is the real issue here, and instead chooses to direct our attention to his OCD, which isn't even the issue here. Besides, it is also not her place to decide whether a parent feels comfortable with a dog being so close to their literal toddler even if the dog is 'a sweetheart'. She can't decide how other people parent, that's it.

I offered him as a compromise that I would rather have him sleeping over at my house than the opposite, and I even bought a basket for his dog so he can bring him with him to my place, the dog having then his confortable spot for sleeping. My other request was that I could not tolerate eating with the dog trying to snatch food from plates, so I asked he train him to stop doing so. He was still not confortable with the compromise I proposed saying I was not accepting of his dog, when I fact I felt I went way out of my way to find a sustainable compromise.

Something along the lines of, \u201cMental illness is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.\u201d If your BIL can\u2019t relax or isn\u2019t in intense therapy for his OCD when it directly impacts his daughter and the time she gets to spend playing or being with his family, then he\u2019s got some issues to resolve and would be TAH if he is neglecting that responsibility. \n\nHOWEVER, it\u2019s as equally unfair for him to fulfill his compulsions as it is for you to leverage your dog over a child. That makes you TA. \n\nI have 2 dogs myself and no kids. They _are_ my kids. My entire world.

He\u2019s preventing his child from fully experiencing life the way a child should, and possibly passing his anxiety to her with his extreme obsessions/compulsions.

Your behavior is not conducive to maintaining a healthy relationship with them. I think you need to focus on whether or not your family matters enough to find an alternative. \n\nMoral of the story, I would say ESH bc it\u2019s not fair for you and your BIL to use a dog and a literal baby as pawns in getting what either of you want.

To your point, it\u2019s really nice to be able to take a trip that\u2019s just for yourselves sometimes. And when we had my first dog, it was truly easier to board her and visit my ILs (who aren\u2019t dog people).\n\nIn my case, because I can\u2019t board either of my dogs, I\u2019m just stuck. I do what I can and draw the lines I need to, to keep everyone safe and myself sane. That makes my extended family unhappy sometimes but I don\u2019t have readily available backup care for my dogs (not a good scenario in and of itself but it is what it is), so at the end of the day, it\u2019s on me to be where I can provide their care.\n\nIf OP and her husband CAN board their dog, I think they SHOULD.

Not trying to be a jerk. I think \"try being compassionate/kind\" is better here than \"the bigger person.\" People with mental illness aren't being \"the smaller person,\" just as people with cancer, heart disease, or diabetes aren't smaller/bigger. Everyone is the same size, so to speak. Compassion can come in handy, though.", "I strongly suspect that OP is heavily exaggerating, honestly. A few reasons:\n\n1. When I was waitressing, it wasn\u2019t entirely unusual for a table to be in and out within 20 minutes; no way is he really keeping a baby waiting for that long while he wipes down a chair. I can\u2019t imagine anyone \u2014 even his wife \u2014 agreeing to stand there waiting for long enough for neighboring tables to order, receive their food, eat it, and get dessert or pay the bill.\n\n2. We\u2019re talking about a baby too young to be vaccinated, during a pandemic. Aside from how sticky those high chairs can get (ick), this is also a different world than it was when the benefits of exposing kids\u2019 immune systems to germs outweighed the risks of really severe illness. Even if they live somewhere with very few cases, I wouldn\u2019t blame a first-time parent who\u2019s still being cautious in case of another wave. There could be some real OCD involved, don\u2019t get me wrong! But if the 1-year-old is going to restaurants while COVID still exists, I doubt it\u2019s as over-the-top as OP suggests. \n\n3. OP describes the issue with the dog as a germ phobia, but BIL cited worry about the little one being knocked off the boat. I would be terrified taking a 1-year-old in a prolonged boat trip; I\u2019m not saying it should never be done, but I know someone whose son drowned at a well-attended pool party with lots of adults; all it takes is a very momentary distraction for things to go very wrong, and there\u2019s no coming back from that. Add in a dog large enough to knock a child over? You don\u2019t have to have OCD to find that situation stressful.\n\nAll in all, I get the impression OP is exaggerating BIL\u2019s symptoms to invalidate his valid worries. Even the best-behaved dogs can accidentally knock over a 1-year-old (there\u2019s a reason many dog parks say \u201cno kids under (age)\u201d instead of just \u201cno aggressive dogs\u201d \u2014 I\u2019ve seen adults land flat on their backs when happily-playing dogs ran a direction they didn\u2019t expect), and I\u2019m suspicious of any dog-owner who completely dismisses the possibility that their dog could pose some risk, especially to a very small child with minimal experience with animals. I love animals and have an absolutely wonderful dog of my own (aside from my own assessment, I have positive feedback from many others and zero complaints), but I know that doesn\u2019t mean everyone will feel safe having their child around him. That all being the case, I\u2019m not too worried for BIL\u2019s child; unless OP cites something more problematic, this sounds more like a pushy dog-owner trying to invalidate and dismiss someone who committed the crime of not loving their pet.", "I change my clothes when I get home. It's disgusting to sit around in outside clothes. Also, RSV and Covid-19 are still knocking people off and the public has an aversion to washing their hands.

Compare that to being basically stuck in a hotel room with too many people and no grass or trees to pee on, no where to run, a little person moving about which people are constantly being anxious about because it\u2019s a small child and they have to worry about them going overboard, rail or not\u2014this sounds like doggy anxiety hell to me.

It\u2019s not an AH move for you to decline the vacation and do a different family trip that you, your spouse, your kid, and your dog can all enjoy together.\n\n(Bonus spite points if you rent your own houseboat on the same lake at the same time)", "I love my sister's dog.

I'm not saying he's not OCD about germs, just that this example is normal. \n\nIt's also normal for new parents to be a bit over-protective of their child around a dog that is bigger than their child. Labs are usually great around kids, but his behavior doesn't seem unusual.

Is the houseboat a new environment to your dog? Is it a new environment to the child?\n\nToddlers are noisy, curious, unpredictable and messy. So are dogs. You can train a dog as much as you want but it does not guarantee their behaviour especially so when they\u2019re in a new environment. Toddlers are the same in new places.\n\nObviously a 4 month old and a toddler aren\u2019t the same, I have a 2 month old baby and a 1.5 year old niece as well as two dogs, and the dogs respond to them completely differently.\n\nI think you\u2019re looking for trouble by forcing the issue and you\u2019re doing it for selfish reasons.
