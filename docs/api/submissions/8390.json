{"id": 8390, "submission_id": "10mbns1", "title": "WIBTA for pulling out of a family vacation if my dog can't go?", "selftext": " Background: My BIL Thomas has really bad OCD, especially regarding his daughter (Ellie - 1) and our dog (2 yr old lab - Bella). After his daughter was born, we all found out that he has really bad issues with germs. He's super careful with sanitizing and limiting germ exposure. For example, if they go out to eat, he spends like 20 minutes wiping down the high chair before letting Ellie sit in it, or if she goes to the playground, he changes her clothes right when they get home. We have a dog who we view as our child. Thomas hates bringing Ellie around our dog because of the germs. Whenever we get together for family dinners, he used to just hold Ellie, or make us lock Bella up in a different part of the house so that Ellie could run around. He's starting to realize that that isn't sustainable, so he's slowly becoming more comfortable with Ellie running around while Bella is around. To clarify, Bella mostly leaves Ellie alone. Even though he's slowly warming up to it, he still refuses to come to our house because of Bella, and even asked us to leave Bella at home when we got together for Christmas (we said no, she's family).\n\nThe story: My husband (Bobby) really wants to go on a trip with his family this summer to a lake. We talked it over with his parents and decided to rent a houseboat and my FIL said he would take care of the cost of the houseboat and us kids were going to split the gas. Bobby was talking to his sister (Amber - Thomas\u2019 wife) today and she mentioned that Thomas had said that if Bella is going, they're not. I guess Thomas is worried about Ellie and Bella being in such close quarters with each other and is worried about Bella accidentally hurting Ellie (the example he gave was Bella accidentally pushing Ellie off the boat). Bobby tried talking with her and she's going to talk to Thomas and see if we can convince him that everyone involved will be safe (there are guardrails on the boat so no one can accidentally go overboard) and make sure he knows that both Bella and Ellie will be under constant supervision, especially when they're together. Not only that, but we want to do some training with Bella and Ellie in the next couple months before the trip to make sure they are comfortable around each other, since they really don't have a chance to be with each other without Thomas intervening.\n\nThere is an extra fee of $30/day for pets that we're planning on paying, which is a lot cheaper than if we were to put her in a pet hotel for the trip. And we don't have any other family or friends that can watch her either. So besides just wanting to bring her because she would have so much fun, it's also easier (and cheaper) for us to bring her with.\n\nBobby is worried that his dad is going to tell us not to bring Bella so that Amber and Thomas will come on the trip, and I told Bobby that he should tell his dad that if Bella isn't coming, then neither are we, which might make us the AH. So, WIBTA if we say we're not going if Bella can't come?\n\nETA: I mentioned this in a comment, but we do have a 4month old human baby as well as the 2 year old dog. So there is no jealousy that they have a baby and we don\u2019t, or a lack of understanding about having a dog and baby together in the same space.", "created_utc": 1674792413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mbns1/wibta_for_pulling_out_of_a_family_vacation_if_my/", "score": 3799, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your brother-in-law doesn't want to go with the dog, that's his decision. If your father-in-law and mother-in-law are paying for the trip, then it's reasonable for them to ask a dog not to go. Especially if it means they get to take the trip with their grandchild. I know your dog is like a child to you, but that doesn't mean it is to everyone else and that everyone else has to act accordingly. In your own home is one thing, but this is a joint vacation you're all agreeing to take together.", "NAH unless you push for having Bella on the boat. I love my dog and hate traveling without her, but I also accept that not everyone likes dogs and some people are varying levels of fearful around them. If I have to bow out of something because someone isn't comfortable around my dog that's fine - it's part of what I signed up for when I got her! My desire to have her there does not outweigh someone else's comfort. It sounds like Bobby is trying very hard to be more comfortable with Bella, and with Ellie being around Bella. That's awesome of him, and something that is going to take time.\n\nIn this specific situation, I think this might be setting everyone up for failure though. Being on a houseboat is very tight quarters unless you're also going to be on Below Deck, so I can't blame Bobby for being anxious about this. Ideally, both Bella and Ellie would be watched 24/7. Realistically, that situation is honestly something that I would never consider. All it takes is one moment of either Ellie or Bella behaving badly and the other lashes out, and even without injuries any budding trust is broken. Similarly, even if they're getting along well, if someone gets distracted both Ellie and or Bella can get injured easily, and water isn't a great surrounding for that situation", "Why don\u2019t you let Bobby go and you stay home with the dog?", "Info: how does the dog use the bathroom on a boat? Has your dog been on a boat for that long? How will the dog get daily exercise?", "Gonna be honest. No one but you guys wants your dog around at every single family trip and event.

I would buy and gift Ellie a Type II life jacket for safety and bathe your dog the day before the trip (no one likes a stinky dog).

As I\u2019ve said before, and as someone else on the post already replied, you cannot play along with the obsessions of someone with OCD. Yes, it is very prevalent in my family. Yes, more than one counselor and a psychiatrist have told us the same thing. Thomas needs to take responsibility for his obsessions. If he is not seeing a therapist and a doctor for meds, he should be. If he is, he needs to use his coping techniques.\n\nTaking a dog that has always been welcome by the family on a family trip to a lake is not unreasonable.

Thomas doesn\u2019t have an issue with the dog itself. He\u2019ll play with her and mess around with her,  he just gets worried about his daughter being around her, which I do understand. He also has a hard time with the germ side of things and we\u2019ve been told that\u2019s why he won\u2019t bring Ellie to our house. \n2. Bobby and I have a kid ourselves, a 4 month old baby. So it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. \n3. When we first discussed the idea with the family, we made it clear that we wanted to bring the dog and no one said anything about it. It was after the fact when Bobby and Amber were talking about it that she brought up that Thomas had said they weren\u2019t going if the dog was. \n4. Bobby and I have talked about leaving Bella at a pet hotel, but it\u2019s almost double the cost of what it would be to bring her with and we really don\u2019t have that kind of money. \n5. We\u2019re getting a boat with 3 rooms, so all of us will have our own room. The dog is excitable, but she\u2019s a total sweetheart.  We want to do some training with her and Ellie before the trip to get them used to being in close quarters with each other. \n6. Thomas is in therapy and recently started medication for his OCD. He recognizes that there is a problem and has been working on it and he\u2019s been doing great so far. Everyone in the family has noticed improvements and we are super proud of him for it. \n\nI guess my bottom line is that I\u2019m not sure where the line is between enabling his OCD behaviors but also being respectful to his decisions. At the end of the day, we don\u2019t want there to be any negative feelings on this trip, so we\u2019re hoping to come up with a solution that works for everyone, even if it means the trip doesn\u2019t happen.", "So this dog is just going to piss and shit all over this boat for a week? YTA", "I would say soft YTA, bc the dog was there first and you value it as much as a kid. If it\u2019s not aggressive, your brother honestly is keeping them apart for the wrong reasons, he\u2019s probably gonna do more harm to his kid\u2019s immune system cleaning her environment like that so young (given that I don\u2019t know how clean you keep your dog). However, YTA for wanting to bring Bella on a boat where Ellie\u2019s family is also invited, since Bella has already accidentally pushed ellie off of a boat before. I was fully on your side before that pint and my stomach flipped. A toddler getting knocked into any water but especially the side of a boat is incredibly dangerous even if they know how to swim. Ellie can be gentle and safe with kids, but it sounds like she didn\u2019t even mean to. It\u2019s not fair to want to bring a sweet but bumbling being into an area where it has already endangered another being.", "YTA.

The best way to help the guy with OCD is to treat them just like anyone else and don't change your actions to accommodate their OCD.

So the only solution would to make sure you're never around a dog, ever.  As to the dog and the child on the boat together, why are we assuming the dog is the hazard here?  You're catastrophizing.  Think of it this way.  An argument could be made that a toddler is less conscious about safety on a boat than a dog.  The risk could not be just the dog and the toddler being there together, but the toddler being there.  And why is the dog a greater risk than the adults?  They are larger and an accident involving an adult human would be more likely to propel the toddler than one with a dog.  These are all risks, *everything* in life is a risk.  The question is are these risks to the level that the only solution is to not bring the dog?  I'd say no for me, a lifejacket on the child, which is reasonable for anyone on a boat, would certainly suffice.

OCD is an irrational disorder, so even if Thomas sees reason in this proposal it might still be difficult to get him to agree to it, but I hope that all of you can work something out.", "I'm anything but OCD, lamentably my SO might say, and have some familiarity with managing risk through eliminating or mitigating unnecessary risks to achieve an otherwise risky but high value goal.  In this case, the goal is having the toddler safely aboard with the other humans; the unnecessary risk is the dog, who does not understand physics nor has any particular interest in the child's well-being.  It's not just about the danger of immersion, btw, but also of wave/wake action coupled with erratic dog movements propelling the already unsteady child into hard surfaces.\n\nAs for the coprophagy, not ever having a dog around my face or food is perfectly acceptable...highly desired in fact.  Kids like dogs, usually, so one has to be comfortable with some level of that sort of interaction, but there's no reason to encourage it.  It doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing scenario.", "[removed]", "All fair points.  If you were the one requesting the dog not come for those reasons I'd have no issue with it.  My risk tolerance may be different than yours in those instances but yours aren't irrational and if that's what you wanted that's fine.  Just going off of the OPs post I'm not granting the same acceptance of the reasoning because the OCD appears to be the driver.  You are correct in saying that those concerns could be valid but I'd also have to take into account the person with the concerns.  I admit I'm not impartial on this topic either as I have diagnosed OCD and tend to see situations like this through a different lens than other people.  It is just too easy to escalate an obsession when even a small concession is made when dealing with OCD and I have spent years training myself to never give it an inch.  It may make me seem somewhat inflexible when the topic is breached and I mean no insult to the points you made.", "[removed]", "I understand and appreciate the discussion and your POV.  It is difficult sussing out where the OCD ends and legitimate concerns begin, if indeed they ever even do begin for him.  I had not given sufficient weight to that latter possibility and am glad you raised it.", "To be honest, I think that in this case it would be a matter of needing more information. I have OCD too including around \"contamination\" and minimizing safety hazards and such, all of which dogs play into, but I also am not fond of dogs in general because they vast majority of them are sensory nightmares (I'm autistic) and I have a history of trauma with them (to the point that I used to be actually phobic of them, managed to work through it, and can now even interact with dogs I know well and I do like those ones).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo somebody who only knows about my OCD and not about my autism and trauma might think that a similar situation to the one OP describes involving me would just be a concession to OCD, but it might be more. For what it's worth, the cultural mindset that everyone should be happy around dogs even if they don't have trauma, OCD, etc. is kind of exhausting, some people just don't like dogs and shouldn't be vilified for it, especially on a vacation where accommodations will have to be made for dogs.", "Oh shoot.

Let us know what you guys decide to do?\n\nPersonally, I'd give up a lot NOT to be locked into close quarters in the situation you describe, and isn't that the nature of a houseboat?\n\nEdit:  INFO - what breed of dog, is it a water lover? \n\n(Originally the first line of the post, it was cut off when I tried to acknowledge Snelliepoo's comment about dogs on houseboats.)", "Okay, other things to address after reading comments:\n- Leave me alone about not mentioning my own kid in the original post. There\u2019s a character limit and when I first tried to post this, with the mention of my kid, I exceeded the character limit and had to repost. I had to edit this a few times to get it within the limit and the only time I mentioned my baby in my original post was at the very beginning when I gave background on who all was going on the trip. My husband has another brother going to, but the only people involved in the current issue is me, my husband, my dog, my BIL, SIL, niece, and FIL. \n- To clarify all who is going it\u2019s: my MIL, FIL, my husband\u2019s sister, her husband, and their daughter, my husband\u2019s brother, my husband, me, our baby, and possibly our dog. So 7 adults, 2 babies, and a dog. I know, it\u2019s a lot. All names are made up. \n- We have a ski boat that seats 6 people (babies are included in that, even if they\u2019re lap sitting, per state law) that we are bringing. The dog has been on that boat before and loves it!\n- We did talk about either camping or staying at a lodge on shore in addition to the houseboat, but everyone going decided on the houseboat. It\u2019s a big lake (I\u2019d specify which one but I\u2019m trying to keep this somewhat anonymous). The lake in question though is drying up, so it\u2019s not like we can really wait until another year to go. The reason for the houseboat is that there are sights to see that are about 50 miles from any marina, so unless we want to spend 4 hours round trip on our little boat that 3 people will have to sit out of anyway, the houseboat is the only way for everyone to participate. \n- My husband\u2019s original idea when he brought this trip up to his dad was that everyone involved (3 couples plus his single brother) would split the cost of the boat and gas evenly and we would pay the extra fee for the dog. My FIL decided to pay for the houseboat entirely and just us kids would pay for the gas and we would still pay the pet fee. \n- We are getting a bigger houseboat because we have such a large group going.  We\u2019re getting one with 3 rooms, sleeps 10 people. All 3 couples will have their own room (dog will sleep in our room with us) and my single BIL will sleep on the couch (he has agreed to this)\n- I in no way want to downplay my sympathy towards my BIL\u2019s OCD. I understand that he can\u2019t help it. I understand that it\u2019s a serious medical issue. I myself suffer from anxiety and depression, so I understand mental health issues. My dad suffers from OCD. I get it. But everything I\u2019ve been told by my dad and my own therapist is that it is not healthy to validate unhealthy OCD behaviors. All of us, including my SIL, are concerned about the potential impacts his behaviors will have on my niece growing up. He is in therapy and he is getting help.", "INFO: does BIL have actual, diagnosed OCD, or are you characterizing his observed behaviors (wiping down high chair) as OCD?

Your baby can be held, carried in a sling, and etc, toddlers have a mind of their own and try to do whatever they want! On top of this you have to worry about the dog going near her. I hate the idea of dogs licking my baby\u2019s face. I\u2019ll probably get down voted for this but its disgusting!

It annoys me to no end when family or friends feel entitled to bring a dog(s) to my, or any other persons house for a holiday or gathering.  Most of the time they do nothing to police the dog\u2018s behavior, happily enjoying themselves while other responsible persons deal with the goings on.   As others have said, the dog can be your family, but it is not to others.   \n\n\n Beyond the simple dog imposition, which I feel is the crux of this dilemma, is the inclusion of the BIL OCD and such.  It feels to me that this aspect was embellished and brought to the forefront to distract from the issue at hand, entitled \u201ddog mom.\u201d   The thought that 3 groups of people will be sharing a confined space together is already a potentially tense endeavor.  Then to have a large dog forced in as well, when many don\u2019t want to be around said dog in a more open space is just bonkers.    \n\n\nThe request that the dog be confined when that family is over is also not, in my opinion, outlandish.  As stated above, we have lots of pets and host quite often, including 18+ on thanksgiving.  We routinely stash the pets in confined area for their comfort as well as the guests, especially at the start points of commotion.    \n\n\nYou can make this your hill to die on.  And that\u2019s ok as it would be your choice in how you feel.  Just remember that others\u2019 feelings are also valid, even if they oppose yours.

That's not a bad thing, but you can't expect anyone else to care about your dog as much as you do and you certainly can't fault a responsible parent for not wanting to let their kid around a dog they don't know well enough to trust. Has your dog ever spent extended time on a boat before? That's a pretty intensely different environment for a dog, and you can't really predict how they might behave in that kind of stressful situation unless you've done it before, and if you have, did your brother get the opportunity to see how he reacted on the boat to determine whether his behavior would be safe?", "As someone with a 5 month old baby, my dog is absolutely not my child.

He has his family to help him if needed.", "She sounds entitled either way.", "A toddler *has* to have constant supervision on a boat, there's no way around it.", "No. It's wild to expect a dog to have constant supervision while the 5-6 adults present are also trying to simultaneously maintain constant supervision over a 1 year old and a 4 month old and enjoy their vacation.", "It doesn\u2019t even sound like OCD to me. I sincerely doubt he\u2019d spending 20 min wiping down a high chair. I also wiped them down and even an extreme wipe down wouldn\u2019t take more than a couple min. \nThere is also nothing wrong with changing your kids out of clothes they wore on playground equipment. Kids piss on those things.", "Thank you! There are NAH; there is a family raising their baby alongside their dog who planned a trip yet one of the other family members has a debilitating phobia of germs which he extends in unequal measure to their dog. \n\nMy lab went on boats with my bf and I and everyone was always glad to see him, including on bf's boat. If the lab ever did not come with us, people would ask why, and if it was close by they'd ask if we could go get him.

OP is using their attendance as leverage to get a certain benefit.", "Planned, but not paid for except in a share of gas.  It's a group trip now.", "I struggle with anxiety/OCD myself, and I can tell you that I would be an anxious *wreck* if I brought my own damn dog on a houseboat with my toddler.\n\nI totally get where your BIL is coming from, this kind of vacation is going to be a little stressful at points no matter what he does. He's going to have things that are pushing his limits and it sounds like he's done some amount of work on figuring out how to manage that.\n\nPart of managing it though is avoiding situations that might overwhelm you. Being a parent is anxiety-inducing enough as it is, it's hard not to be constantly worried about your kid. And when you're surrounded by family, it's easy to get distracted and suddenly the kid falls down, now they're crying, everyone is trying to help, they're surrounding you while you try to comfort your child...grandma is trying to hug her, grandpa is giving medical advice to you, your sibling is saying \"I told her not to do that\" and a cousin is trying to hide the fact that they pushed the kid.\n\nIt's chaos, and it erupts in a second. Seriously, my heart rate increased as I typed that shit up.\n\nNow add a dog in that mix, and put it all in a cramped houseboat.\n\nHoly shit, I would have a hard time not exploding at everyone and then I'd be here asking if *I* was the asshole for losing it in a situation I tried pretty hard to avoid.\n\nI've taken my dog on a family vacation before, too. It was in a huge cabin with a massive amount of room for him to run around and play in though. We had fun, and the family seemed to like it, but it was a good situation for it. We only had one under-2 child on that trip between 3 families, so we had enough manpower to handle dog and toddler needs without getting in each other's hair. We had room to step away and chill if things were getting a little crazy. Also, we actually have 3 dogs and only took the one that we knew would be manageable, the one who was more aloof and unbelievably tolerant of chaos. \n\nTHAT kind of vacation is perfect for that particular dog to come along on. \n\nI wouldn't dream of doing it on a boat though, and definitely not with a clinically anxious parent of a 1yo. That's kind of where I'm seeing the asshole behavior here.", "Yeah, I think the worst part of this arrangement is the houseboat part. I wouldn't want to be trapped in a boat with a toddler and an infant, and I'm not sure where the dog is supposed to relieve itself, unless they are frequently docked, in which case it seems like you might as well rent a house that is not a boat? Maybe I just don't understand what a houseboat vacation is supposed to be like.", "The point of a houseboat is to go out on the lake for a couple days and just dock in a cove.  Who the hell would WANT to take their dog to do that?  That sounds miserable.", "This! OP already showed she is the one being unreasonable by bringing her dog everywhere. This is what set a YTA for me. You can't put a dog at the same level of a child. Maybe her family is just tired of her dog being brought everywhere.", "There should be some form of therapy available for pet owners who start to confuse between a pet and a child.

Grandparents are better off either holidaying for a shorter period with each of their childrens families separately or offering to take just the kids away with them when they\u2019re a little older. I think option B is probably the best one, then there\u2019s no need to deal with the entire middle generation trying to use their children as bargaining chips.", "Sounds like hell not a vacation to me. Toddler and dog running around like crazy, a little baby crying all the time. Even if the 1 year old were sleeping I couldn't relax. I'm not OCD but I would spend the whole vacation being afraid she would wander off and fall off the boat. Plus dog energy in a confined space would drive me nuts.", "But if the BIL really does have OCD and op isn\u2019t being hyperbolic that isn\u2019t being just a case of being paranoid and unreasonable - **OCD is a debilitating mental illness**. \n\nPart of the diagnostic criteria for OCD includes the patient being away that their behaviour (spending 20 minutes cleaning a high chair) is unreasonable but they can\u2019t stop them selves from doing it (**compulsion**) because for example he believes that he doesn\u2019t clean the high chair for 20 minutes Ellie will get sick and die (**obsession**). Or eg some one I knew with OCD had to lie awake at night and apologise for every misdeed she had ever done (**compulsion**) in order to repent other wise she would be punished (**obsession**), this was when she was around 7 before she was diagnosed. \n\nHopefully the fact that OP\u2019s BIL has started to relax with Ellie means that he is getting the mental health support that he needs. BIL is well aware that cleaning a high chair for 20 mins is excessive but he can\u2019t help himself. \n\nAnd even if BIL didn\u2019t have OCD it\u2019s not unreasonable for some one not to want a dog - *even if it\u2019s the sweetest most friendliest dog in the world* - around their child, especially an infant. That is the parents prerogative, human child trumps *furbaby* every time. If OP is willing to have her dog around her baby that is also her prerogative but it doesn\u2019t give her cart Blanche to force the same on any other parent.", "In what world is it paranoid to think it could be unsafe to be on a houseboat with a 1 year old and a dog? It is responsible to assess risk. And the kid has a risk of accidentally drowning on a houseboat especially if there is a dog that could knock her overboard.", "Agreed!", "The other side is stating a reasonable boundary. There's no way in hell I'd want to take a vacation on a house boat with my one year old and someone else's dog.\n\nHard no.", "But OP is not the parent of the other child. He doesn\u2019t get to make decisions for another parent about what is acceptable for that child.", "When I take my dog somewhere else, humans needs come before my wants for my dog. If I took my dog to my parents\u2019 house and someone came around who was afraid of dogs, he\u2019d go in the crate or outside. If I had a FAMILY MEMBER who didn\u2019t want my dog around, I wouldn\u2019t constantly try to force my dog down their throat. \n\nI certainly would NEVER presume that my dog would be invited on a family vacation or that he should even come! Yeah, he\u2019s part of MY family, that doesn\u2019t mean everyone else sees or has to see him the same way! The entitlement of OP is staggering. \u201cMy dog is my child,\u201d okay, in YOUR home, that\u2019s your MO. It doesn\u2019t work like that in the real world, which is why you don\u2019t get to take your dog into grocery stores, duh.", "And if you don\u2019t account for the price of occasionally boarding a dog when you GET a dog, you\u2019re not financially secure enough to be a pet owner. \n\nYou can pay to go go on vacation but you can\u2019t pay to board the dog? I call BS.", "Unless the BIL has been diagnosed, and it doesn\u2019t sound like he has, then OP has no business using OCD as a term for what her BIL is actually doing, which sounds like reasonable precautions. \n\nPublic high chairs are disgusting, parents should absolutely wipe them down. My kid got filthy at playgrounds, I frequently changed her clothes when we got home. I wouldn\u2019t have her around any dogs when she was tiny, because it\u2019s impossible to teach a 1yo how to be respectful of someone else\u2019s dog, and we didn\u2019t have one at the time. \n\nHonestly it sounds like OP has a terribly behaved dog she forces on everyone all the time, and she\u2019s trying to shift the blame from herself to her \u201cunreasonable\u201d BIL.", "Being overly cautious about germs around your baby and having OCD are not the same thing.", "I wouldn't put my dog in that situation!", "I fear OP may grasp it just fine but not give a rat's ass about it.

Absolutely.\n\nI love my dog to the moon, but he's a rescue and he needs stability. When we travel, we hire a college student to stay with him.

It's great for everyone.", "Yea, taking Bella on a week long boathouse trip?  Yea, I could understand that.  But to a family gathering for Christmas?  While we did take our pup to my family's side of Christmas (it was 2 weeks after and 2.5 hours away so we took her so she wouldn't be crated all day) we did not always take her to my in-law's Christmas since they were in town.  As a dog owner, you just need to read the room for different events.", "I thought it was weird that the dog was brought for Christmas. From the statement, \"they asked us to leave Bella at home\", I'm taking it that it was a day visit/dinner. Sounds like they bring the dog everywhere. For me, that sounds excessive.

He needs to get used to in in some settings, but they can\u2019t expect to take it everywhere.

Either way, I don\u2019t think anyone here has malicious intent, this just sounds like trying to jam a square peg the size of a Buick into a round hole made for a cork.

As for exposure therapy, some people say it is very effective, but as I am not specialised on treating OCD, I don't really think I can offer an informed opinion. However, wouldn't the point of exposure therapy be that the person is *in control* so that they can stop when it feels overwhelming and stop it from spiralling into literally traumatic? What I'm saying is even if BIL *is* supposed to be undergoing exposure therapy, even if this is what his therapist recommends (again, good-faith) it is not OPs place to decide when or where he should be exposed and whether he should be doing it during a vacation (which is meant to be a relaxing time and not a time you spend in panic every single minute of the day). She also keeps dismissing his very valid concerns on toddler and dog on-board safety, which is the real issue here, and instead chooses to direct our attention to his OCD, which isn't even the issue here. Besides, it is also not her place to decide whether a parent feels comfortable with a dog being so close to their literal toddler even if the dog is 'a sweetheart'. She can't decide how other people parent, that's it.

I offered him as a compromise that I would rather have him sleeping over at my house than the opposite, and I even bought a basket for his dog so he can bring him with him to my place, the dog having then his confortable spot for sleeping. My other request was that I could not tolerate eating with the dog trying to snatch food from plates, so I asked he train him to stop doing so. He was still not confortable with the compromise I proposed saying I was not accepting of his dog, when I fact I felt I went way out of my way to find a sustainable compromise.

Adding dogs to the mix sounds even worse. \n\n-signed a mom of 2 dogs and 2 former toddlers", "If he is truly wiping it down for 20 minutes and immediately changing his kids clothes the second they get home, that is not normal behavior for keeping your kid safe in public. Sanitizing and cleaning/changing isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s the level he goes to. No one here can know if OPs exaggerating or not and if he\u2019s *not* then this is something that absolutely could be a compulsion and ocd. If he is exaggerating then yes obviously he\u2019s an asshole but I haven\u2019t seen anything here to suggest that other than his entitled behavior about bringing his dog everywhere which isnt enough to decide everything he\u2019s saying is unreliable.", "It's not better to get viruses younger ... Especially viruses that you don't build immunity to or that mutate too significantly for past infection to help, like colds and flu. The daughter will be healthier putting off catching the flu, or RSV for that matter, or anything else, as long as possible. When you get sick or exposed your immune system kicks in - it doesn't forget how to work because you haven't been sick recently.", "I got naked in my garage after every ER shift during the height of Covid and never got sick (was also pregnant) cleanliness def has its benefits", "Thank you! I was waiting for someone to bring this up! \n\nAlso, I grew up in a house with three dogs and was exposed to all the germs under this idea of building a stronger immune system. I have horrible year-round allergies, but never get sick with anything that isn\u2019t allergy/sinus related. So 50/50, there\u2019s no guarantee.", "Maybe they can ask BIL to contriubute to the cost of the pet hotel, since it's his issue, not anybody else's.", "Not a houseboat, but when my dad first got his pontoon, we also kept our dogs tethered until it seemed they weren't interested in leaping over the rail.( well one did a peterpan when he saw a giant fish,opps...that Was FUN) Still they managed to get wet from the shore and thank goodness they could dry out at our campsite. Maybe OP could camp nearby where the houseboat moors? Parks?", "Immune systems develop without needing exposure. However, being exposed to common bacteria and allergens when can help with future exposures to those things. The same is not true for viruses. There's a reason why the younger the child, the higher the risk of death from flu or RSV, and it's not lack of previous exposure.", "Ellie is over 1.", "Believe me, it became a dealbreaker for me too after that experience", "It would depend, but unless they\u2019re mooring the whole time, houseboats dock. I know several people who live on houseboats with their dogs full time.", "Also, I don't know if you could find a pet sitter on Christmas and where I live, the boarding places were closed on Christmas. No new dogs, and no getting your dogs. They had someone come in to spend some time with the dogs, but no pickup or drop off. Meaning that they would've had to drop their dog off early on Christmas eve and then picked him back up on the 26th. That's not fair to the dog.", "OP says they didn\u2019t actually witness BIL wiping the chair down.  Changing a toddlers clothes, after playing at a playground is smart.  My toddlers would be filthy, after falling in the dirt and plopping down in whatever.  If there\u2019s sand, there\u2019s likely cat poop.  Playground equipment usually has bird poo on it.  If BIL was truly a germaphobe, he wouldn\u2019t take his toddler to a playground or to a restaurant.", "It is scientifically proven that exposure at young age help for children with no risk factor (no immune system problem already present, no parents/siblings with allergies). Of course, we can\u2019t prevent everything nor expose children to everything, but there\u2019s no indicator in the post that the child is sick or has risk factors.", "It doesn't always help *enough to avoid all issues with everyone* but it does help. I too get sick easily and have autoimmune disorders, but had I not grown up on the countryside odds are it would've exploded as bad as for my cousin (big city, overly hygienic mom) who becomes allergic to anything after eating it for 2 weeks and is living off things like rice and ostrich meat.", "The child is 1, so even more vulnerable. The dog is 2.", "Great thought! Especially if finances are a concern, they definitely should throw that out there as a gentle ask. \u201cGlad to do this for you BIL! We weren\u2019t anticipating the extra expense. Since we\u2019re boarding our doggo to accommodate you, would you be able to help us foot the bill? We would appreciate it so much! We really want to be able to join family for this fun vacation.\u201d", "Yes you can, and they are very effective.", "Fluticasone propionate kicked the worst of my allergies for me and made it much more manageable. I don't know why a year of nasal spray convinced my rhines to stop itis'ing for good apparently, but I'll take it.", "Yes, and they told me there is no connection with my daughters excema and her eating eggs and gluten because the test is negative. We have ten years of \"experimental evidence\", but no, we are wrong.", "Doctors, the guys responsible for over prescription of opioids? Yeah they don't tell you about the stuff they don't sell.\n\n\nAlso no big pharma study is going to suggest not taking pills.", "And also because big pharma can't patent honey.  FTFY", "And that\u2019s a totally valid choice if you want to do it! I wasn\u2019t willing to do it just to go to my parents\u2019 house for dinner for a few hours. Aside from the fact that our kennel cost closer to $55-60 for a night, I preferred having the dog in the house overnight due to living on a block that was a little borderline. So our choices were to change the schedule (wasn\u2019t going to ask for that but Mom certainly could have if she\u2019d wanted), dog came along, or I stayed for only about 3 hours instead of closer to 5. I would have been totally fine with any of those and made it clear that it was up to my parents and I\u2019d go with what they were most comfortable doing.\n\nAll that to say, I think it is reasonable to work something out for a longer drive IF and ONLY IF the host is fully on board. Again, if the host isn\u2019t comfortable with the dog being there, then the dog needs to not be there. I think we probably agree on that.", "No, these are markers of OCD and not just a concerned dad.  Ellie is now 1 so she should have gotten quite a few vaccines by now and her RSV risk should be lowering soon as well.  I get BIL not wanting to constantly take his toddler to a crowded venue if she was born with some immune issues, but at that age, a normal toddler shouldn't be isolated.  I mean, SIL can't even enter stores at an outdoor mall? That's a little over the top.", "I'm guessing they were mouth-breathers....?  LOL!", "Animals can get Covid.", "It REALLY helped me. Granted we had moved and I was new to the area, so that may be a reason why. I was taking zyrtec almost every day. After a month of the honey, the symptoms markedly lessened for me. It was still windy , and still spring, not like the seasonal change did it. \nShrug. If it was coincidence,  worst thing I did was eat honey..lol and I got away from the zyrtec.", "People are generally allergic to airborne pollen,  which bees don't gather.  Different plants have different pollination strategies and the windspread pollens don't have nectar to attract bees, and the pollen is not structured the same.  \n\n\nhttps://www.brandywine.org/conservancy/blog/wind-pollination-social-distancing-plant-world#:~:text=Wind%20pollinates%20a%20wide%20range,the%20seeds%20of%20future%20generations.", "My sister has brutal allergies and swear by local honey", "Also, what pharmaceutical company would invest in that research? Can't patent honey, and they have antihistamines already.", "Plus, u get to eat honey! Yum!", "This means you have to know where, and from what kind of flowers the bees got their pollen.  So, locally sourced only, and then only from beekeepers who track it.  A tiny fraction of available honey.", "Yep, agreed.\n\nI was more talking about folks who completely ignore their hosts' preferences (or even needs) not to have a dog there.\n\nWhen I was in my early 20s, I lived in a rented townhouse with 3 other women around my age. We were *not* allowed to have pets there *at all,* and that was on the lease. My sister, however, brought her dog over when she and the rest of my family came for Christmas present opening that year. I tried to tell her to take the dog back home (she lived less than 20 minutes away), citing the lease issue, but she refused, and my parents took her side. It's that kind of dog owner that I'm talking about."]}
