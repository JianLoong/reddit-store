May I remind you that children of wealthy family live with their parents far far longer because the rich know it's financially beneficial for the kids future. Additionally in many cultures it's absolutely reasonable that someone lives with their parents until they're either financially stabel enough to move away somewhere good or marry and move out  \n\nThis whole you're 18 you're grown thing is not normal, we're humans a socially resource dependend species not birds that can fly after being thrown out the nest. \n\nThe guy's just 20, not 30. He wants to build stability for himself through a business. He also studies and that's not an easy job either. I work in a field where there is mostly mental work and it's also quite exhausting over time. I think everyone here who says YTA is being the asshole. \n\nAdults shouldn't bring kids into this world if they don't plan on supporting them financially until they have build a backbone to support themselves. He's 20 trying to build something aka a business and a career through a degree. You're all acting like he's a man in his late twenties that sits on their parents couch and eats chickenwings and watches TV 24/7.\n\nHe's a student and a working person.\n\nWhy should he have to waste money on an apartment and food etc if he has parents. I mean this benefits capitalism if single people live alone for no reason, this does not benefit the environment nor the working class. \n\nthe rich would never expect this type of crap from their kids just saying. They are laughing abt us trying to push eachother into \"financial independence\" while they live mutligenereationally in mansions.", "NTA. \n\nYour parents are kicking you out. They don\u2019t get to pretend everything is all right.\n\nHowever, you have a dilemma, and if you want to engage in reasonable adult decision-making, it seems that putting your  business aside for now, whether you stay at home or get your own place, is probably the best course of action.

It sounds like you are not contributing to the household, and they are tired of it. If you are an adult living under someone else's roof, you should be contributing to chores, cooking, cleaning. Your \"business\" sounds like a money drain, not something that makes money. They don't want you living rent free off of them and not doing things around the house, which is reasonable. Why are you retaliating? It shows how immature you are. They want you to grow up. Dump the business, focus on studies, and help around the house like an adult.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's your life, you don't have to have them at the dinner if you don't want to.\n\nIt's hard to comment on the reasons why or the broader situation with your parents because you haven't said why they want you to move out or how their behaviour has been, what your relationship is like etc.\n\nMore info needed if you wanted that", "They\u2019re not wrong \u2018cause it\u2019s their house.

First, you are to over extended to try to start a business right now.  Your priority should be your education and a job that you get a steady pay check from.  Doesn\u2019t sound like you have any time for anything within your home.  Your parents are not wrong.  However you are.  Sounds like your angry that they suddenly want you out and your doing it out of spite.  You\u2019re upset because they are taking a stand and you\u2019re angry because they\u2019re screwing with your plans.  They think you need to grow up.

And you're still in school?  You also work commission?  Does that pay anything at all?    \n\n\nSo your parents are not only footing the bill for you to live at home and go to university, but your time is spent on a company you own, but which costs money and brings none in, and \"commission sales (do you make any money at all)?\"\n\nYou're holding a 3.0 GPA.  Why?  Because of time spent on endeavors which earn no money but which cost money?    \n\n\nIt sounds as if your choices are what are causing them to want you to move out.", "It\u2019s kinda funny that you mention the rich wouldn\u2019t expect that when you consider the fact my parents are multimillionaires.
