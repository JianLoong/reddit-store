Get super butthurt about it because you KNOW you looked silly and then lash out like a big baby.\n\nIm literally at work getting paid while having this exchange. If i wasnt i wouldnt even bother browsing reddit.\n\nMost reddit users especially here are using it to kill time or alleviate boredom. YOU apparently use it ad a soapbox to go on long political rants that make you look like a joke.\n\n\nSo the question here is do YOU have a life?", "No, his parents are, which makes this worse. \n\nHe needs to sell out his business, and get back in his parent's good graces, and attend business classes if he isn't already. He is too young to be involved with a business like this, which requires a great deal of marketing, publicity, and footwork. None of these he can handle right now. He is too young to have the connections needed (like vendors and other business) as well as a steady clientele to reinvest into the business. This is a field he can concentrate one once he graduates and has more time, until then he needs to apologize and try to get them to help him out until he's done.\n\nStill not the asshole, just a little naive to think he can balance all of this, not taking into consideration emergencies or things that happen spontaneously.", "Even still, OP has no obligation to include his parents in any of his birthday plans.", "ahhah pls. I didn't spam any nonesense it's very obvious to me that you're projecting. You're the butthurt one dear not me. This is not a spam, in fact it's true that humanity has become narcissistic to the degree they're not willing to support their offsprings because of financial propaganda which in this case didn't apply. However unlike you I couldn't have known as I had better things to do then to scroll down the many comments of other poeple and read their replies. \n\nKudos to you for getting paid at work tough! Whether that will make you less bitter is another question for another day, if you so as to dare to self reflect instead of acting like a clown getting triggered over a matter that at first had very little to nothing to dow ith you.", "Does that mean they buy essentials and you buy beer, soda, candy etc.?", "Your original post was like 5 paragraphs most of which had nothing to do with the post\u2026. Thats the opposite of what someone with no time would be posting to reddit.\n\n\nAlso are you seriously using \u201cno you!\u201d As a retort after being called out by more than just me for your nonsense?\n\n\nThere is no bitterness or negativity in me especially in regards to this exchange but i find it hysterical that you of all people are trying to play this all off like i am angry or upset when you instantly devolved into name calling multiple times when you got caught not reading the post.\n\n\nYou got visibly triggered and defensive\n\n\nResponded like a big baby multiple times. Tried to counter legitimate criticism of your antics as \u201c no life bro\u201d and \u201cnah thats you bro!\u201d \n\n\nThen move to \u201cmind your business bro!\u201d After you very publicly got on a soapbox and started yelling your incoherent bs at the top of your lungs.\n\nWe all have bad takes sometimes and we all sometimes get lazy and half read/mis read posts\u2026.
