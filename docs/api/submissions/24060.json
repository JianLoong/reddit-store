He needs to lock the doors.\n\nI (17 m) have a cousin (22 m) that is living with me and my family due to some housing issues.\n\nI'm perfectly fine with him staying in the basement. He is usually outside working all day so I don't see him much, but when he comes back he never locks the door.\n\n I happen to be a fairly paranoid person (I listen to true crime and some cases have made me more cautious about unlocked doors) and I've asked him if he could lock the door when he comes home. He said he would try but his ADHD probably won't let him. To be fair he is very forgetful, but I would have thought locking the door will be something easy to remember.\n\nIt's been 3 months and he has never remembered to lock the door once. I always remind him but he pulls the \"I have ADHD card\" every time. I've let it slide for this long but the last straw was 2 nights ago. \n\nI was watching TV late into the night. When I went up stairs to go to sleep, my urge to check if the doors were locked kicked in. I went to check and the door wasn't even properly closed. There was a small gap. I shut the door and scream internally. If I hadn't check, we would have slept with he door slightly open. It freaked me out .\n\nIn the morning I told him \"look I don't give a damn if you have ADHD you need to start locking the f-ing door. Last night you didn't even close it. What if someone walked in?\" He then got up and was obviously pissed. He said that we live in a nice area so that will never happen and that I'm the only one with the problem so I should deal with it. \n\nMy parents have told me that I was harsh and should just be more calm with this, but the thought of something bad happening because he didn't lock the god damn door scares me. Since then I've been staying up late to make sure I lock the doors before turning in for the night. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nI feel like I should clarify that he only uses my home for sleeping. He crashes for the night and he's off in the morning. Sometimes he doesn't show up for weeks. So there is no routine. We've tried sticking notes on the wall so that he reads it but he always seems to pass them by or he notices three days later. \n\nMy cousin is also very prideful. If we point out he's wrong or needs to fix something he will deny it and continue. It's like taking to a wall. He also has plans to move to another country \"soon\" so he thinks there is no point in memorizing \"rules\" of my house. \n\nAlso for the tech thing to lock the door. My parents are kinda old fashion in the sense that they don't trust a piece of technology to lock the house and stuff.", "created_utc": 1691384918, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kb0kp/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_i_dont_give_a_damn/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You both need to sit down and work on your shit. You need to work on your paranoia. You live in a very safe neighborhood, and one door being unlocked isn't going to change anything. If someone wanted to get into your house, a single lock on the door wouldn't stop them. Think about other things you can do to feel more secure in your life  (hint: stop listening to true crime). I used to have this problem to a much, much worse degree (I was sleeping under beds or behind sofas to stay safe from imagined violent people). What helped me was treatment for my anxiety, not doubling down on safety measures.\n\nYou are taking your paranoia out on your cousin, but he can also try a little harder. As someone with ADHD I struggle with this kind of thing, but there are many tools at our disposal to help with things, *if we are willing to make them a priority*. It doesn't seem like your cousin is interested in making it his priority. And hint: yelling and cursing at people doesn't usually help in motivating them to care about what you want them to care about. Try making an emotional appeal to him instead, telling him it makes you feel scared and unsafe. And then ask him how you can support him in putting up some reminders around the house to encourage him to double check if he locked it. Or do what some other people around here posted, and install an automatic lock.", "NTA.", "INFO: Do you live in a community where people have to lock their doors for safety?", "NTA - adhd here and yeah occasionally I do shit like that (after my dog ran away the other day, I came back and left my car key in the engine, spent an hr looking for it before i thought to check the car\u2026but I was really frazzled because his timing was the worst)\n\nBut his response when pressed was basically \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit\u201d \n\nADHD means even when you give a shit you still fuck up occasionally. But this is not that.\n\nAlso I know you said no tech solutions, but a deadlock that is locked when you close it from the outside? A locksmith can adjust the lock to fit current keys. That would be an appropriate accomodation, and is what I have for these reasons.

He can develop strategies to remember, as this is a matter of safety. Set alarms on his phone to remind himself for example.\n\nYou two should get a smart lock. One that works with your phones, auto-locks after you enter, etc. Would help both of you out immensely.", "**NTA.** I have ADHD, and while I sympathize with your cousin, this is an issue of safety that clearly needed to be dealt with ASAP. It was fair for you to want to call him out for blaming his lack of responsibility on his ADHD.", "NTA. I also have ADHD. Although it is a super serious thing to deal with, you're only allowed to use it to explain your actions, not excuse them. Everyone, including those with disorders, needs to be actively trying to be better people. If he at his big age hasn't found a way to work around the disorder that makes his life harder, then that is truly a him problem. And he can expect the people around him to continue to nag him to do things correctly. Especially if he isn't truly sorry. \n\nNo matter what neighborhood you live in it is important to lock your house up at night, not because of personal preference, but for general safety.", "NTA! Someone easily could have entered your home and hurt you & your family.\n\nI had a similar issue with a former roommate who would never lock the door because 'we were in a quiet neighborhood'.\n\nOne evening, the neighbors crackhead son BURST through our door (bc roommate didn't lock it) with a gun and asked if he could hide inside because he was hiding from the cops.

Would a note placed where he can see it help, say where he leaves his keys? Would having a person in the house remind him help?\nIf he gets home about the same time every day, would an alarm on his phone help?\n\nPart of his problem remembering this is that he is out of his normal space and normal routine.
