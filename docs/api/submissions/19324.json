I notice you didn\u2019t put his age in the post, is your husband the same age as you? Do you have family and friends you\u2019re close to? His behaviour is unacceptable", "OMGarden!!! (Cancer survivor here) \n\nGirl. You go buy everything and anything you damned well want to.\n\nNOT THE AH!!!\n\nYour husband...thats an entirely different conversation i will just keep my thoughts to myself about (mine cheated then left me with 2 toddlers mid chemo) \n\nI got your back.", "NTA.  Your husband should be ashamed of himself.", "NTA. \n\nI am so angry at your husband right now. Reading this had me literally crying with rage. I\u2019m so sorry for everything you\u2019re going through.", "You are NTA!!\n\nAnd your husband is selfish for thinking the money should be used to go on a holiday.", "Good lord your husband is an A H.\nSpend that $$$ on a nice wig. You can continue to wear it even when your grows in btw. Saves styling time and will probably save money in the future.", "NTA.  Whatever you can do to reduce your trauma is healthy for you.  Shame your husband can't understand that.  Keep doing what you need to for your mental health.", "He could have shaved his head and had a wig made with his hair.  Instead of getting haircuts, he could have gotten shaves instead.  After a few years, it might have been enough.  And they would have saved the money to pay for that vacation.  Mind you, that would have taken some sacrifice on his part...  /s", "Not yet but I\u2019m going to order what you suggested (live in a rural area so not a lot of selection in stores) because Ive heard and read great reviews on scalp massagers and essential oils, . thank you for your suggestions\ud83d\ude4f", "I do this! And it amazed me that it actually worked. I have fairly thick hair but it was thinning a bit in one spot so I started using this oil and sometimes use my fingers, sometimes the massager and it does help.", "Effucks is a brilliant portmanteau!"]}
