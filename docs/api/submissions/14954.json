I for sure can't only blame that but it took me until my late 20s to realise how internally misogynistic I was and start to unlearn it. When I look back at those lyrics now, I find them really disgusting (for example, Eminem's songs about murdering his wife) and I'm sure it had a big effect on me. Make sure you educate yourself and don't internalise the sentiment.", "By all means listen to what you want.\n\nBut understand that people absolutely will judge you on the totality of that music, not just the aspects of it you would like them to judge.

That being said, others can and will judge you on the message those songs deliver. If you feel comfortable hearing lyrics that degrade women, it doesn\u2019t mean you would make similar comments but it does mean you excuse the comments for the sake of the song, others have a lower tolerance for that type of media. \n\nWhen we consume media with explicit bigoted messages there\u2019s a level of concern as to how much or how little we agree with that message, you may not degrade women in your daily life but there are people who share your interests that do and listen to the same music because they agree with the message it sends.", "NAH - You like the music you like.

When its her turn she makes her choice.\n\nYou need to learn from her.", "yeah, I get you. I am very familiar with Cannibal Corpse lol. Yeah, I think if you know an artists truley holds a certain belief you cannot ignore then I think that's fair enough. We all have our line in the sand. \n\nIf OP's friend's line in the sand is the type of misogyny she heard then fair enough. I don't think that mean OP sucks for not thoroughly checking a playlist to make sure their friend wont be offended though\n\nA bit off topic...  but i assume you know Slayer given the other 2 bands you mentioned. The fact Tom Arraya is a devout Christian always surprises me haha.", "Its not that simple. OP mentioned that the rapper in question was dead. Rap is getting old enough that intent and sub-text of lyrics written then aren't the same as their sub-text now. Lead Belly's use of the N word in Bourgeoise Blues or Bob Wills' lyrics in Take Me Back To Tulsa are examples of lyrics where the words effect the listener differently now than they did originally. Rap is getting to be an old enough genre where this is a factor.", "I feel like I have more of a say on misogynistic lyrics as a woman than I do racist lyrics as a white person, but yes I shouldn\u2019t have played that in front of her", "The friend knew what type of music OP listened to and requested for her to play music. Could\u2019ve put on her own or gone without it", "It sounds like she did try to confront it directly, but was dismissed by OP. If you feel like the relationship is a one-way exchange then why continue it?", "Yes it's an assumption. This is a small excerpt of someone's life told by one side, so there's no way to get a full picture of everything going on. When the friend said OP never listens that was a context clue that it's happening elsewhere in their lives. \n\nI think OP was right in skipping the song for her friend, even if it was reluctantly. The problem was in the aftermath of the situation and how both parties handled it.", "I'm a metalhead. When I have friends over who are not into metal, I run a non-metal 80s playlist. It's not that hard, you know.", "Lol I never got too into them, so I didn't know that. That makes it ridiculous that the kids I knew in HS who listened to them were how they were. I'm guessing they didn't know either, because they made fun of religious people whenever they had a chance.", "I\u2019m almost sure she was referring to this issue in particular. It\u2019s the only thing we\u2019ve ever argued about, but it\u2019s come up multiple times", "If that's truly the case, then repairs should be easy. Tell her you wanna sit down and reflect. If she feels unheard you gotta listen. Like I said in my other comment too, it's worth checking out other artists. I don't listen to very many new rappers, but I've never had a problem with Aesop Rock, Del tha Funky Homosapien, Toby Nwigwe, Busdriver, Zaia and a few more. On the fence there's MF DOOM and Blake Rules (some objectification, but generally respectful). I'm not sure what kind of hip hop you're into, but there's something out there for everyone to satisfy your taste and still align with your morals. Your friend might appreciate the effort, if nothing else."]}
