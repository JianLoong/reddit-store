I for sure can't only blame that but it took me until my late 20s to realise how internally misogynistic I was and start to unlearn it. When I look back at those lyrics now, I find them really disgusting (for example, Eminem's songs about murdering his wife) and I'm sure it had a big effect on me.

That being said, others can and will judge you on the message those songs deliver. If you feel comfortable hearing lyrics that degrade women, it doesn\u2019t mean you would make similar comments but it does mean you excuse the comments for the sake of the song, others have a lower tolerance for that type of media. \n\nWhen we consume media with explicit bigoted messages there\u2019s a level of concern as to how much or how little we agree with that message, you may not degrade women in your daily life but there are people who share your interests that do and listen to the same music because they agree with the message it sends.", "NAH - You like the music you like.

I agreed on all her points and said I wasnt supporting it, i just liked the *feel* of the song.

Art is problematic only in as much as it actually influences you behavior, and I certainly don't act anything like anything in that music.\n\nThat being said, there is the separate the art from the artist argument, which does have some merit. The way I approach it is this....is the issue a single band member who is no longer a part of the band, and the content still stands without them? Example of that would be Simple Plan, who I don't have an issue with despite the actions of a former member, who was not the primary songwriter or composer. Flip side of that is Lost Prophets, which I don't recommend you look into unless you are prepared to lose all faith in humanity. In that example, the problem is with the primary creator, so all of their work is tainted. I am, however, willing to listen to music created by the non primary band members. For me, in a nutshell, it comes down to what the person/s did that was problematic, and to how great a degree is supporting the product supporting the person. Like still liking Cullen in Dragon Age, despite his voice actor being horrible. It's his performance, but it isn't his creation, ultimately.  \n\n\nIf anyone actually read all that, please remember that this is just my opinion and is as likely to be wrong as anyone else's.

Many aspects of society are built by the subjugation, degredation, rape and murder of women. I happily listened to and sang along with songs flaunting the desire to do these things to women for years. And those artists make a living off perpetuating it.

She told me that art can be offensive, or challenging, and of course told me to not repeat a lot of the language used in these songs. As a young woman listening to rap, Eminem in particular, I tried to understand where the misogyny came from. In Eminem's case, he had an abusive mother, and rocky intimate relationships with his partners. Understandable that he'd spew vitriol about them, right? \n\nIt's been a while since I last really listened to rap, and I decided to put on some of my old favourite Eminem songs on recently. I'm only in my late 20s, but I've had time to experience personal relationships, and misogyny, especially as a woman in trades. By this point I'd also acknowledged and started working through my own internalized misogyny (I'll sum it up with \"not like other girls\"). It was difficult to listen to the music and enjoy it.

Doesn't help his ex wife at least self harmed, but potentially tried to kill herself twice (the claims are self harmed to the point of hospitalization. One of which was directly related to the release of Kim) making everything much worse in hindsight.

Really try to see it from her perspective and maybe have a conversation with her about it. Another commenter mentioned that they listen to women rap artists who make music that uplifts women. Maybe you could have an open, honest conversation with your friend about how you both feel about this topic and then maybe look together for rap music that is made by women and for women.

I can say I do listen to music that I don't agree with either, however I have found it harder in my later years to internally rationalize it.\n\nA good example is Chris Brown or DaBaby. Listening to their music gives them power, financially, popularity, reach, and more importantly influence. How do we come to terms with the fact that these people can now take their influence and make other decisions with it?\n\nFor example, can you imagine the amount of people who disagreed with DaBaby's homophobic comments and then the amount of people who love his music that probably got upset at \"cancel culture\" and have now developed a mindset against anyone in the LGBTQ+ community? Whoever might have been on the fence about their feelings might now be influenced and feel angry towards that community. And anyone can say, oh well if they're homophobic they'd always have that feeling or they'd always turn out that way, I disagree with that as we can unlearn hatred and discrimination.\n\nLook at Chris Brown who actively sings about colourism (racisms younger sibling), and he is hugely popular. It really just reinforced that light skinned people of colour are higher value people. It makes people like Dani Leigh (DaBaby's light skin ex gf) make songs like Yellowbone, singing that men want a yellowbone girl, and it actively perpetuates that dark skin black girls deserve to be treated as less than. There are studies out there that prove dark skin black girls are viewed as adult black males when involved situations with law enforcement.

Are you seriously suggesting that a person is responsible to know each and every song that may offend their friend in a playlist with potentially hundreds of songs in it and should be concerned about this in their own home?", "I didn't want to argue that they were equal. I find there is a weird hang up bias when the Holocaust or Hitler is mentioned to conflate usage of the Holocaust as being equally compared to something else and that is simply not what I did. I agree when used to equate something to the Holocaust there is nothing happening on the earth right now that equates to the what happened for the entirety Holocaust. Aspects can be used for comparison, for example we see many parallels between the US and therise of Hitler but for someone to say the Holocaust is happening is also not true and is disrespectful to make that mention\n\n I'm not equating the Holocaust to a singers abhorrent lyrics. I am comparing Hitler's mindset (discriminatory) to other people who exist today who are discriminatory, Chris Brown with racism and DaBaby with homophobia, and they are open and proud of it. Should the world change, should they ever had the power that Hitler had, what actions would they take, what would they willingly eradicate from the world. And if we were to imagine a world where Hitler sang his opinions in the world rather than what he actually did, would his viewpoints be ignored because he's not a threat? It's just music? I'm asking these questions not from the POV of would we accept it not knowing what Hitler was capable of, but I'm hindsight knowing what he did.\n\nChris Brown actively takes his discrimination and makes tangible decisions that affect the world outside of his lyrics. For example, he is famously known for refusing dark skinned black women in his presence/club sections, and says no darkies allowed. The argument that why would one care to be near him, or why would anyone care to be in his clubbing booth are moot points as he is exercising racism. It's also not to say this action of Chris Brown could morph him into Hitler, that would be silly to posit. BUT, with the amount of people that are like Chris Brown or like DaBaby, mircoaggressions from a large group of people can influence the mindset of the population. Nothing to do with music but look at the anti trans movement that is spreading so much. Laws being enacted etc\n\nMy entire argument is not supposed to be what's right or wrong or what we should and shouldn't do. It's an opinion of me just being confused and having a hard time reconciling this in myself. Like no lie, judge me all you want but I like some of Chris Brown's songs. I used to have his album before he hit Rihanna and as I got older I used to feel guilt for indulging in the song Forever that I eventually phased it out", "That is not what I said. I asked would his viewpoints be more acceptable  if sung. Not would \"would anti semitism in songs be better than genocide\". Like people get an argumentative hard on when Hitler is mentioned to fight tooth and nail to say XYZ is being equated to the Holocaust. I get when it's warranted but it's like a kneejerk reaction when people see the name Hitler \n\nAre people really that bad at reading comprehension?\n\nEdit: I did re read my last sentence in the original post and it's unclear that I was making it about viewpoints. My argument still stands about the kneejerk Hitler reaction however. It's like no one cares about what's being said and someone ssd the word Hitler or Holocaust and people jump to others throat to just say inaccurate insulting statements. Calling people dumb, being condescending, questioning someone's intelligence etc.", "I agree but the song game on in a playlist, Friend asked her to skip it and she did.
