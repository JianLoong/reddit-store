We finalized our headcount and settled on a final amount for all services rendered, the final amount was around 15k. The vendor allowed payment through a check by mail, or someone dropping off the check in person. Being out of state, we opted for option 2. \n\nI sent out a check to the venue through online bill pay, and got confirmation the payment was to be delivered the day of the wedding (which was a Saturday). I had a confirmation number from my bank payment was sent and money was taken out of my account.\n\nThe wedding was wonderful, and I enjoyed the next day (Sunday) with my husband. We received a text from the vendor she still had not gotten the check. I looked at my bank account and see the check was sent with a delivery date of the next day (Monday). I shared a screenshot of this with the vendor, including the confirmation number. I offered to call my bank with her on the line as confirmation. I offered to venmo or Zelle her the money. She insisted on a physical check, which I do not have as I am out of town. She told us she would withhold our items left behind (unused favors, the top of our cake, guest book, other items). I explained again how the check would be there tomorrow and I offered venmo or Zelle again, and she refused to accept anything except a physical check. \n\nI had to spend over 30 minutes on the phone with my bank to stop payment on the check (which cost $50), then I had to transfer money to my mom so her check would clear. Then I had to drive back to my moms house to physically get the check (~30 min), then back to the venue to hand deliver the check (~45 min). When we got to the venue, the manager (not the person I had been texting with) thanked me for the check and told me not to worry as it would be put into the lockbox and they don\u2019t cash checks until Tuesday. \n\nAt this point, I asked why I had to spend the day after my wedding running around town when my check wouldn\u2019t be cashed for a few days, and the original check was due tomorrow. We argued back and fourth, no yelling just trying to understand what happened. \n\nI 100% that the vendor must be paid for services rendered, but I am frustrated I had to spend the morning after my wedding running around doing this, only to to learn it wouldn\u2019t be cashed until Tuesday (after my payment was to arrive). \n\nAITA for being upset that I had to spend my morning like this and arguing with the manager when I dropped off the check?\n\nEdit - spelling", "created_utc": 1686531746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/147aueo/aita_for_how_payment_was_handled_for_my_wedding/", "score": 2089, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Surely the headcount was finalized weeks in advance? \n\nYTA for the fact that they hadn't received final payment by the time your wedding occurred - I don't blame them for being panicked and holding on to your items, because they would have no other leverage (other than to sue you) if you skipped out on the final payment. It's the venue's rules for only accepting a physical check - you don't have to like it, but you do have to follow their rules and submit payment on time (which it sounds like you did not do) or accept the consequences.", "YTA.\n\nI think the venue was very kind and understanding, honestly. I work in this business, setting up tents/marquees for outdoor weddings. If we haven't been paid on the assembly day, we don't show up. Be glad they let you in at all.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is YOUR duty to make sure that your bills are paid in the agreed upon manner.", "Why didn\u2019t you just let them hold the items until the check arrived?", "ESH. Why didn\u2019t you just bring the check to the wedding?", "YTA\n\nThe vendor needed payment that day and you didn\u2019t deliver. If you\u2019d sold an item on marketplace would you let the person pick it up without paying? I\u2019m going to guess the answer is no. The same concept applies here. There was no way for the vendor to know whether you were telling the truth about the payment coming and with scams being so rampant I can understand insisting on payment.", "YTA.  Even if they don\u2019t deposit the checks until Tuesday, they wanted the check immediately to make sure they received it.  Otherwise they run the risk of having to chase your for the money if they check doesn\u2019t arrive, which is even harder for them to do since you live out of state.  The best thing to do would have been to bring a physical check with you to the wedding to give to the vendor day-of.  Since you didn\u2019t do that, you had to do all of the running around the next day to fix the situation.", "More info\n\n\nWhen did you finalize the head count? Day of? 1 week before? 2 weeks before(", "YTA. You had to pay the day of your wedding. The day they chose to deposit is totally up to them. They need to have the physical payment in their hand when the contract states. \n\nThe only reason you end up having to drive up there is because of your own lack of planning. Plan better next time, and you won't have to go through all that trouble", "YTA - they needed payment, they didn\u2019t have the check, they told you they didn\u2019t have the check. Im not sure why you made this into much more of a conflict than it needed to be. More over, if you had to pay the balance on the day of the wedding why didnt you just bring your checkbook that day?", "If you have confirmation from the bank saying delivered on Saturday,  then fight them for that $50 back. They messed up.\n\n\nAlso...you say that you had to drive all the way to the venue to deliver your check or they would hold on to your extra favors and stuff? Ummm.....wouldn't you have to drive to the venue to get that stuff anyway?", "YTA - All the rules apply to you. Money was to be delivered by check on or before the event date and this did not occur. The check did not arrive and your acct was past due. She was doing her job. You drove around to solve the issue; your issue.  Arguing occurred because your late check created a sequence of events.  \n\nFocus on this is resolved. We often invest our frustration on a topic that is completed. You are starting a new life and this goal was met. Happy Nuptuals.", "Wow, YTA \n\nWhy didn't you pay her the check sometime during wedding?", "YTA. Should have just taken a physical check the day with you. That\u2019s on you for poor planning.\n\nAlso unclear on why you left your stuff there in the first place.", "You are not the asshole for being upset but the vendor has the right to get paid before services are rendered. There are no really assholes here, you didn't want to deal with the hassle but the venue wanted to be paid before the event. I'm pretty sure that some people skip out on their bill so the venue was cautious.", "NTA, but just let it go.  Don't make that your main memory of your wedding.  Think of it as practicing for dealing with various government agencies.", "NTA\n\nwow, talk about horrible customer service. the payment is expected the day AFTER it is supposed to clear. but...that isn't good enough. \n\nwell, fortunately there's yelp and other review sites. leave an appropriate review about the complete lack of customer service. \n\nor, should we say....customer careLESS?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
