He warmed up to her pretty quickly and she started frequently spending the night. \nMy son\u2019s best friend (M14) stayed the night Thursday night since they didn\u2019t have school, and my girlfriend didn\u2019t have work so she was home with them. Since then, I noticed he\u2019d been quiet, but he wouldn\u2019t tell me what was wrong. \nTonight at dinner, she asked my son if there\u2019s anything he wanted to tell me. He didn\u2019t reply, so she literally says \u201cDo you think your dad would like to know you\u2019re gay?\u201d\nHe immediately burst into tears and left the table. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and never talk or go near my son again. As she was walking out trying to apologize, I told her she had no right to do that to him at all, before slamming the door on her. \nI found my son in his room sobbing, it took a bit of coaxing for him to open his door, and when he did, he apologized. HE apologized for being gay and begged me not to hate him. I reassured him I\u2019ll always love him and got him to calm down. It turns out, she caught my son kissing his friend goodbye Friday afternoon and they\u2019ve been a couple for about 5 months now. \nTwo hours ago, I\u2019ve gotten facebook messages from both her dad and brother calling me a terrible person and over reacting. They told me I had no right to treat her like that or break up with her over something so minor. I decided not to argue and just blocked all three of them.  \nAs I\u2019ve calmed down, I\u2019ve started to feel bad. She was crying pretty hard as I yelled, but I didn\u2019t care at the time. I was just so mad she revealed something so personal that he wasn\u2019t ready to share.

He now knows that he is your first priority and anyone else is a distant second. \n\nNot only that, but you may have saved his life. From the Trevor Project website:\n\nResearch suggests that among LGBTQ youth, only one-third experience parental acceptance, with an additional one-third experiencing parental rejection, and the final one-third not disclosing their LGBTQ identity until they are adults (Katz-Wise et al., 2015). Another study found that LGB young adults who report high levels of parental rejection are eight times more likely to report attempting suicide and six times more likely to report high levels of depression (Ryan et al., 2009).\n\nYou are a hero, no an AH. \n\nHug your son tight, you\u2019re in this together.", "NTA\n\nGood job and your a great dad.\n\nThe way he was sobbing it sounds like she made him believe he was wrong for being gay.\n\nYou did the right thing by protecting your child from that.", "NTA.   \n\nIt was very callous of her to do that to your son. \n\nOpening up about sexuality is a very personal thing which should be done at the discretion of the person.\n\nNot only did she rob him of that discretion, she put him on blast-- and at a delicate age, might I add.", "Nta, you made the right call, it\u2019s not something minor, this was something your son, should have revealed if and  when comfortable to reveal it not for someone to casually out him like that Jesus.", "NTA Good for your for standing up for your son.  \n\nA person that uncaring about the feelings of others is not a person to keep in your life, just keep her blocked.", "I'm just so in shock that your ex and her family thought this would be okay.

Seems like she was looking to be the hero in your eyes by dropping this \u201cbombshell\u201d and it backfired. Classic case of FAFO. \n\nFrom your reaction being so supportive, your sons fear of telling you seems to be misplaced and it makes me wonder if she said something to him to feed the fear that you wouldn\u2019t accept him. Have you asked him what she said to him when she saw him kiss his boyfriend?", "NTA. Outing a kid is a form of abuse. Your son deserved the chance to be ready before he told you, and she took that away from him. Blocking them all was the right move.", "NTA.  Quite the opposite.  What she did was cruel and shameful.   Your son is lucky to have a father like you.  Most gay kids don't.

Sorry if that wasn't clear.", "It was literally none of her business.\n\nAt most she should uave talked to him about talking to you, but it wasn't her job to tell you.

You deserve applause. \n\nI\u2019d only say YTA if your girlfriend doesn\u2019t become an ex. Major overstep on her part outing him.

On top of that your son didn\u2019t need to be shamed for who he is. You did good here. I\u2019d reevaluate my relationship to GF if I were you", "NTA, you chose your son over some gossipy woman you only knew for a year like any decent father would. The fact that she\u2019s sending her family after you only shows she doesn\u2019t even understand what an AH she is. Good riddance.", "NTA. She can't be trusted again. Such an utterly terrible thing for her to do. Your child deserves better.", "NTA - you protected your son, showing him all that love is way higher priority than your ex.", "NTA, she had absolutely no right to do that. I'm so sorry your son was outted against his will and thank you for standing up for him.", "Nta she did damage to your kid. Let your papa bear at her. She\u2019s your son\u2019s enemy and now yours.", "Absolutely NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were right to protect your son and to kick that homophobic AH out.", "NTA.

Disgusting behaviour.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to break up with whoever you want, especially if they make your kid cry in embarrassment.", "NTA.

She's a moron, and you acted perfectly", "You are absolutely NTA Every child deserves to have their parent have their back. For her to. Put him? Vile behavior. Block her and her family from all contact. Give your son a hug from me & let him know there is no reason to apologize for being who he is.

That's always the right place to be at. Make this woman your ex, please. If she did this to your son, trust me, she'd do the same thing to you.", "You are my hero for standing up for your son.

You did the right thing. Don't ruin it now by folding up your spine. She's a horrible bullying B.", "NTA. Wow such witchy sneaky behaviour from her.

You absolutely did the right thing!  \n\nThe way GF phrased the question to your son reminded me of an adult pushing a child to confess something to a parent (that\u2019s bad or shameful) that will get them in trouble!", "NTA. What could she possibly say to help this situation or justify her actions? You don\u2019t out someone against their will.", "What a cool dad", "That is not a minor thing to do to someone!

Perhaps she asked if he wanted to be the one to tell him over dinner or if she should go to the dad alone. \n\nOverall, I think totally cutting her off just depends on what motivated her doing this and how tactfully she at least tried to handle things, even if it came off as tactless in the moment.  I would obviously stay in touch with your son and make sure she's not doing or saying anything homophobic, but to me it's a pretty decent possibility that she has absolutely nothing against gay people but just felt like there were rules to enforce and talks to be had, and that was your right and responsibility to be aware of and deal with.", "Eh NTA, I can see how you reacted like you did.

I can't speak for other gay people, but I can try to articulate for a moron like your girlfriend and her family of fools what \"coming out\" feels like to a gay person (from my perspective). You grew up your whole life around your family, maybe they seem like progressive people and maybe they've explicitly told you that they love you no matter what. At the same time, because you're gay, you've heard stories about other gay people who've been disowned and rendered homeless by abusive criminal parents simply for being gay. So then you start to wonder \"what if?\". What if your dad doesn't love you as much as he said he did? What if their love was actually conditional? Even if it might be a remote possibility, that remote possibility is highly salient in our minds given the extreme consequences we can face (homeless LGBT youth are at increased risk for sexual exploitation, for example). Yes, in this day and age, and yes, even in \"progressive\" areas, we still face those things. It's also not always super religious people either who disown their kids for being gay. \n\nThis is one big reason why a coming out experience should be controlled exclusively by the person coming out. I was fairly sure my parents would be accepting, but when I came out to my mom it was *awful*. Lots of ugly crying because of that \"what if?\" scenario. Your girlfriend put your *teenage minor* son on the spot and forced him to go through all of those emotions before he was mentally or emotionally ready. Not only that, but the tone of her comment seemed accusatory, like being gay is something he should be ashamed of. \"Is there something you want to tell your father?\" when you know damn well what the thing is sounds like something a person would say if they caught a kid doing something bad. I can't speak for your son, but if it were me I would *never* be able to trust her again so it is an absolutely reasonable thing to break up over. \n\nOn the off chance your (ex) girlfriend isn't a raging homophobe piece of trash and is instead just an incredibly stupid person with two barely functioning neurons and a feeble, flickering synapse between them, she should take this as an opportunity to educate herself and disabuse herself of whatever clownish ideas she has about the reality of being gay in this day and age.", "Every experience your child has right now is brand new and fragile, as parents we will always want to protect them from the world.
