He warmed up to her pretty quickly and she started frequently spending the night. \nMy son\u2019s best friend (M14) stayed the night Thursday night since they didn\u2019t have school, and my girlfriend didn\u2019t have work so she was home with them. Since then, I noticed he\u2019d been quiet, but he wouldn\u2019t tell me what was wrong. \nTonight at dinner, she asked my son if there\u2019s anything he wanted to tell me. He didn\u2019t reply, so she literally says \u201cDo you think your dad would like to know you\u2019re gay?\u201d\nHe immediately burst into tears and left the table. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and never talk or go near my son again. As she was walking out trying to apologize, I told her she had no right to do that to him at all, before slamming the door on her. \nI found my son in his room sobbing, it took a bit of coaxing for him to open his door, and when he did, he apologized. HE apologized for being gay and begged me not to hate him. I reassured him I\u2019ll always love him and got him to calm down. It turns out, she caught my son kissing his friend goodbye Friday afternoon and they\u2019ve been a couple for about 5 months now. \nTwo hours ago, I\u2019ve gotten facebook messages from both her dad and brother calling me a terrible person and over reacting. They told me I had no right to treat her like that or break up with her over something so minor. I decided not to argue and just blocked all three of them.  \nAs I\u2019ve calmed down, I\u2019ve started to feel bad. She was crying pretty hard as I yelled, but I didn\u2019t care at the time. I was just so mad she revealed something so personal that he wasn\u2019t ready to share.

He now knows that he is your first priority and anyone else is a distant second. \n\nNot only that, but you may have saved his life. From the Trevor Project website:\n\nResearch suggests that among LGBTQ youth, only one-third experience parental acceptance, with an additional one-third experiencing parental rejection, and the final one-third not disclosing their LGBTQ identity until they are adults (Katz-Wise et al., 2015). Another study found that LGB young adults who report high levels of parental rejection are eight times more likely to report attempting suicide and six times more likely to report high levels of depression (Ryan et al., 2009).\n\nYou are a hero, no an AH. \n\nHug your son tight, you\u2019re in this together.", "NTA\n\nGood job and your a great dad.\n\nThe way he was sobbing it sound like she made him believe he was wrong for being gay.\n\nYou did the right thing by protect your child from that.", "NTA.   \n\nIt was very callous of her to do that to your son. \n\nOpening up about sexuality is a very personal thing which should be done at the discretion of the person.\n\nNot only did she rob him of that discretion, she put him on blast-- and at a delicate age, might I add.", "Nta, you made the right call, it\u2019s not something minor, this was something your son, should have revealed if and  when comfortable to reveal it not for someone to casually out him like that Jesus.", "NTA Good for your for standing up for your son.  \n\nA person that uncaring about the feelings of others is not a person to keep in your life, just keep her blocked.", "I'm just so in shock that your ex and her family thought this would be okay.

Seems like she was looking to be the hero in your eyes by dropping this \u201cbombshell\u201d and it backfired. Classic case of FAFO. \n\nFrom your reaction being so supportive, your sons fear of telling you seems to be misplaced and it makes me wonder if she said something to him to feed the fear that you wouldn\u2019t accept him. Have you asked him what she said to him when she saw him kiss his boyfriend?", "NTA. Outing a kid is a form of abuse. Your son deserved the chance to be ready before he told you, and she took that away from him. Blocking them all was the right move.", "NTA.  Quite the opposite.

Such an utterly terrible thing for her to do. Your child deserves better.", "NTA - you protected your son, showing him all that love is way higher priority than your ex.", "NTA, she had absolutely no right to do that.

She overstepped boundaries and could have let this be a bonding moment for her and your son, with her talking to him so he may be more comfortable coming out on his own terms.\n\nI'm so sorry you and your son went through this, it's terrible.", "NTA - I was outed by family to extend family, and they told me many nasty things. My dad never stood up for me.\n\nYou're an amazing dad. You didn't let someone get in between you and your child, and atood your ground. I hope your son is doing alright, and that was not overreacting. She outed him, and he feared you and your reaction. No one has any right to out someone.", "NTA. You\u2019re going to have an inbox full of messages looking for dates after this post \ud83d\ude06", "NTA.\n\nThe way she started this at the dining table,, the way she framed her words, the child's distress, and her/her family's insistence that she didn't do anything wrong all feel so wrong to me. Like she's a homophobe shaming the child. And it backfired on her as she was wrong about OP.\n\nPlease talk to your son. What else she said and did. Keep her blocked, don't even reconnect to talk about breakup. From your reaction, she should know you are done.", "NTA for many reasons. But also wanted to say, you could break up with her because she left chips crumbs on the counters. Her family can get lost with this \u201cyou have no right to break up with her for something so minor.\u201d It\u2019s not minor, and you can break up with her for literally any reason in the world. Also what is with all these full grown adults that immediately go crying to their friends and family to dogpile on someone? Never in my life have I wanted my friends and family to harass someone for me. And it\u2019s never going to make the person turn around and go \u201cyou\u2019re right! We should get back together.\u201d", "Absolutely NTA. What she did was despicable. Coming out should have been based on your son's readiness, and she robbed him of all is autonomy regarding HIS sexual identity. Absolutely disgusting of her.", "you are NTA OP but I have to ask is something wrong with your now EX girlfriend mentally, because some parents when they find out their kids are gay have a very negative reaction, luckily for your son you are not one of them and I say kudos for that but you were right for kicking her out, obviously you are a good parent but there are a lot of parents especially the religious kind would not be so understanding, did she not realize that when she outed him.", "NTA you did right by your son! But you would be TA If you let her back into his life.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA\n\nYou're a great dad. She's an awful person. Never speak to her again.\n\n-a queer person", "NTA. She had no right to dictate when your son should come out. It's deeply personal, not to mention terrifying for a child. He should have had the option to wait until he felt comfortable. I am thrilled that you comforted your son and openly accepted his sexuality. As the mom of a trans daughter, I would never out her to anyone without her permission (now that she's finally told her father, she doesn't care if the whole world knows, so this is not outing her).", "I think the jury has spoken, but surprised that not very many people brought up an alternative motivation besides homophobia or power tripping. \n\nGrowing up, my parents were 100% not ok with romantic partners spending the night or being alone behind any closed doors, and had rules around sex not being a thing high schoolers were supposed to engage in...at least not without the adults knowing and being able to say their piece about \"you shouldn't be doing it now but if you are we are going to have the protection and sti talk\". \n\nIf gf was raised in such an environment, she might have felt it was wrong to keep secrets from you about what was going on with your kid in your house. Maybe she discussed with son beforehand that she was absolutely OK with him being gay and was sure his father would be as well, but that she felt morally obligated to let Dad know because, well, there's rules for boyfriends and girlfriends. Perhaps she asked if he wanted to be the one to tell him over dinner or if she should go to the dad alone. \n\nOverall, I think totally cutting her off just depends on what motivated her doing this and how tactfully she at least tried to handle things, even if it came off as tactless in the moment.  I would obviously stay in touch with your son and make sure she's not doing or saying anything homophobic, if it does turn out she has absolutely nothing against gay people but just felt like you had a right to know everything she did.", "Eh NTA, I can see how you reacted like you did. But she might not have known how to deal with it. \n\nPeople are missing that his friend STAYED OVER and she caught them kissing. It's super awkward at that point but it wouldn't have been appropriate to leave it that he not tell you and continue having his boyfriend sleep over. \n\nIt's entirely possible she told him you needed to know if the bf was going to stay over, and that he should tell you, and reassured him you would be fine with it. He was still scared and couldn't do it, and she made a huge mess of trying to sort it out through lack of experience. \n\nIt's not necessarily that she's a homophobic monster.", "NTA. She was 100% in the wrong and you're a good parent for sticking up for your son", "you\u2019re a good dad and did the right thing NTA", "Nta she was the reason your son felt so ashamed, you did right by blocking them all", "Nta", "You're a great dad.\nNTA", "NTA, she made him think he was in trouble for being gay. That you would be upset about it.\n\nKeep the crazy away from your kid.", "NTA", "Omfg! NTA. Your initial instincts were right. Your poor kid. Keep her away from him. She has traumatized him and inserted herself into something that she has no right to. You did good!!", "NTA. If she did make your son feel bad in any way about being gay, please don't let her back into your home. Your home should be a no-hate safe space for your child.\n\nShe deserves to feel bad about what she did anyway. Was she hoping you'd hate your son? It doesn't sound like she had good intentions outing him to you.", "Bonus, OP taught her a lesson that, while not his job to teach, and a lot late for her to learn, she clearly needed in life. Perhaps her family will reflect on their failure to foster self-awareness and decency in their kin, especially in an age when you\u2019d have to be completely out of it not to realize the very tenuous sense of security many in the LGBTQ+ community feel, if they feel one at all. \n\nGood job being a good dad, OP. When you are ready, if you want to, there are no doubt many people who would be thrilled to meet a partner who has their priorities and relationship with their son in order.", "Well said. OP you did exactly the right thing.", "You would only be the A H if you continued to date her. Keep yourself and especially your son far away from her. What she did was very malicious.\n\nI'm glad you love and support your son and he knows he can count on you.", "Let your bfs 15yr old son have sex in your house regularly. While the bf doesn\u2019t have any idea, because if you tell bf the son might kill himself. Seems like the perfect solution/s", ">The way he was sobbing it sound like she made him believe he was wrong for being gay.\n\nDing, ding, ding!!! \n\nThen she laid it on... Either you tell him or I do! \n\nPoor kid, my heart breaks for him. Great job OP, protecting your son.  NTA", "This is what it seems like for sure. She thought she was going to have this moment and it backfired. FAFO.\n\nGood for you OP for having your son's back.", "Really? My read is that he's stressed because sharing secrets like this is stressful, and he was afraid he would hate him. She wanted him to share because she knew how much it was stressing him out and that the dad would be accepting, but made a very bad call in outing him", "I'm wondering how she reacted when she found them kissing.  Something must have transpired for him to be quiet at dinner. And, like you said, why would he think his dad would hate him?  I'm really curious about what went down", "NTA. She calmly and with premeditation and fake concern outed your son.\n\nI shudder to think what kind of ultimatum she gave him.", "I'm worried that she or one of her supporters will out the son's friend, as well. We have no idea if his family will be as supportive.", "Because she didn't care about him. The way this all went, she was clearly shaming him. She's a homophobe.", "I worry she did talk to him before talking to Dad, and that's why he was scared.", "This is horrifying. She did do it on purpose with unabashed cruelty. What kind of person does that? She intended to cause harm and suffering. Your boy seems like a little angel and he is lucky to have you you both are lucky. Please forget about this horrible woman and do not take her back. She has extreme mean issues and is a monster. NTA", "Sounds like they broke up from OPs post.", "My man is having bfs over at 15, who knows how long it\u2019s been going on, that is not ok. The father has a right to know that his son is spending the night with people he is sexually attracted to. Gf absolutely has to tell the father about it, and it\u2019s better to be done in the open. I am tired of everyone treating gay people like precious jewellery. The reason his son didn\u2019t come out was so he could keep having \u201cfriends\u201d over.", "Gentle correction, it was the ex's father and brother that were harassing OP", "Yeahh, she wasn\u2019t trying to hurt the son, she was trying to stop the \u201csleepovers\u201d happening in the house right under the nose of OP. OP absolutely has a right to know, she probably gave the son an ultimatum that either you tell your dad about your sexuality or I will. And can we stop pretending that the only reason gay people don\u2019t come out is cuz they are scared. In this case it\u2019s pretty obvious why he didn\u2019t come out, so he could keep having his bf over. If you\u2019re gay and scared of your parents the first thing you don\u2019t do is invite your gay BF into the house lol.", "strangely yours is the only comment i've seen mentioning this. def an important issue here", "Op has a bigger responsibility to his child, not the girlfriend that is shaming his child.", "Big no. She crossed a boundary in a huge way and she doesn't deserve any courtesy whatsoever.", "That's a lot of information that you have there. Are you the girlfriend (hopefully x) or a family member?", "You're making at least one assumption, and oversimplifying.\n\nIf she was actually having that line of thought, she could have told OP without putting the son on the spot. There were ways to approach the situation other than making a scene.", "> break up with her over something so minor\n\nFirst, outing a teenager is not minor. Second, OP has the right to break up with his ex because she outed his son, or because she is homophobic, or because she chews with her mouth open, or because she thinks the Star Wars Sequels are the superior trilogy.\n\nPeople need to recognize that starting a relationship is bilateral but ending a relationship can be unilateral. I do not think people should always exploit this asymmetry but sometimes it is necessary to invoke when your partner crosses a red line (e.g. racism, abuse, or violence).", "I also got this vibe.", "Also, NTA. Obviously.", "I think you are probably a good person who tries to see the best side of everyone. I also think that, in this case, you are really, really wrong.", "That\u2019s what I was worried about too. So NTA\nGood for OP standing by his son. I hope the friend\u2019s family will be just as supportive \ud83d\ude4f", "Thank you for this nightmare fuel.  I hadn't even considered that he might have been so scared because of her and not just general teen fear of being different.", "I'm certain she did and in a threatening way. They're both well rid of her.", "Oop, thank you!!", "What part of him crying, needing coaxing to open a door through fear of being hated, led you to the conclusion it was so he could have sleepovers? \n\nYou've made a fair few baseless claims about his motive, whilst knowing literally fuck all.", "Right. I get that most people are focused on the girlfriend outing the son which is wrong in the way she did it, but his sons boyfriend stayed the night and who knows how many times he has stayed over before this incident. 13 year olds can be sexually active. It is important to address this issue with his son after things calm down from the breakup.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s elementary my dear friend. But no I\u2019m not, but that\u2019s almost certainly what happened. \u201cDo you have something to tel your dad?\u201d \u201cTell him now or I will do it for you\u201d", "That's fair. I hope I'm not wrong, because that would be very messed up for this situation; but I do see how you could have this interpretation", "No problem", "The private part is meaningless, the confrontation has to happen and has to happen quick, like the next time dad denies the BF from coming over and son asks why. Should the dad lie? It\u2019s going to happen, if the son wanted to talk in private or come out in private to OP I\u2019m sure the gf gave him enough time.", "Why? So what? It's not like they'l get preggers.", "He did immediately go talk to his son, who had gone to his room and may not have even witnessed the reaction. He did not need to explain anything to her.", "Also it\u2019s been four days since she knew and hasn\u2019t told him, that in her mind (and I agree) is enough time for young Casanova to come clean.", "Why would he deny the friend coming over?", "there are concerns for sexually active 13 year olds aside from just pregnancy", "Sleepovers will be denied for obvious reasons", "Yea, I know. When I was 13, I was doing it in bushes and toilets since a safe home was not an option.", "congrats. that doesn't mean a conversation between OP and his son isn't warranted", "That's between them. Kids will try things, it doesn't matter if they'll parents approve or not. Safe place is more important. If the boys slept in same room before, it's unfair to call it off for what might be just hand holding and goodbye kisses."]}
