We\u2019ve been hanging out more lately and found out more about each other. \n\nActually one of the things we bonded over is the fact we have the exact same facial scar (we even got it at the same age which is a crazy coincidence). We often discuss how it has impacted our self image and self esteem growing up and had lots of conversations. I felt like she understood me.  \n\n\nThe only difference is that she tends to cover her scar with makeup whereas I don\u2019t. (She says that it\u2019s not the same thing since she\u2019s a girl and I get it) \n\nA few days ago we went to a party together and hung out in a room with a few others. One of them was a girl who started chatting with us and Melissa seemed really impressed with her.\n\nAt one point the girl pointed out my scar (which was blunt & made me feel self conscious) but the good thing is that she said positive things. \n\nMelissa immediately joked that \u201cactually\u201d my scar makes me look \u201ccreepy\u201d & \u201cintimidating\u201d. I asked her \u201cdoes that mean you would also look creepy and intimidating if you didn\u2019t hide the same scar with makeup?\u201d . She looked shocked and the people we were with to gave me a look like I had fucked up. \n\nAfterwards in the car we had a massive argument where she called me an \u201cinsensitive asshole\u201d. She said that I\u2019m a shitty person for exposing her insecurity and belittling her feelings. I said that she\u2019s the actual asshole here since she threw me under the bus to impress the girl or whatever (not sure what she was trying to do).  We spent a long time arguing but eventually fell asleep. \n\nSo am I the asshole here or is Melissa?", "created_utc": 1670779389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj0h8z/aita_for_exposing_my_friend_who_has_the_same_scar/", "score": 5531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you are just fine pointing out that she has the same scar under her makeup.  \n\nShe has NO right to yell at you for playing fair during an unfair conversation that *she* caused.   \n Melissa needs counseling and you need to spend time with better people than Melissa.\n\nFYI: I married a guy with a massive scar from the center of the top of his forehead that reached straight down to his nose - it was an accident from his childhood.  After a few months, I really could not \"see\" it any more - really.  When we get used to people, spend time with them and enjoy their company, flaws (like scars) become very unimportant.  \n\nThere's a t-shirt in Florida, US that says \"Scars are tattoos, with interesting stories behind them.\"", "NTA.

I would say both of you were the asshole if you escalated or took it further, but as is, just asking about her scar in the same context wasn\u2019t an asshole move.

Because you don\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean she can say you\u2019re creepy and intimidating.  Why was she so interested in how this woman reacts to you?

I think a better way to have handled it (hindsight being 20/20) would have been to say in front of everyone \u201cComments like that are really hurtful. It\u2019s taken a lot for me to come to terms with my scar and not be afraid that people will react like you just did. Some people never find that courage and would hide or cover it up. Please be more thoughtful about your words.\u201d Nuff said.", "NTA. If she had used a random insult, it would be ESH.

I'd apologize for embarrassing her, but make it very clear that what she did was wrong and you're upset with her.", "NTA\n\nMelissa started this - and in an unpleasant way.  As she knew that the scar had affected your self esteem growing up, it was particularly nasty to say that the scar \"made you look creepy and intimidating\".  You simply replied using her own words.  If those words were hurtful to her, she should not have said them about you.\n\nIt seems Melissa was trying to sabotage your friendships with another girl.

Melissa is definitely the AH here.\n\nPlay stupid games, you win stupid prizes.", "[deleted]", "NTA i literally laugh at people in these types of scenarios.

Realizing that she isn't the friend you thought she was and just be done with her after that.

Then, bring it up with her later - I\u2019d tell her then that if she does it again, you\u2019re going to challenge her with her own scar. Then there\u2019s fair warning, and you can also make clear that you\u2019re just as uncomfortable and she needs to check her hypocrisy at the door.\n\nBut honestly?

I have multiple large and jagged 3 inch scars in varied areas up both my arms also my right hand is very scarred and even has a mutilated and stunted finger also with heavy scarring. When people care about you they dont care about the scars. My husband certainly doesn't mind mine!

Mind you if this is a one off thing, she appoligizes, and you both can move forward happy I wish you both the best. But always remember people who tear you down dont love you or care about you.

I\u2019m so sorry she was so cruel. Good on you for not taking that shit, even if she was a \u201cfriend\u201d. Which as many have said, I\u2019d take a look at that friendship and reevaluate.

When someone you met at a party complimented your scar, she was jealous and tried to deflect the compliment (in a way that backlashed against her).  \n\nMelissa thinks you like her too, and when a guy likes a girl they don't tend to point out her flaws in front of other people.  So when you pointed out her flaw, she suspected that you don't like her as much as she likes you.  \n\nThat hurt her feelings, and you got your feelings hurt, and neither of you are in a good place with each other.

One day after we had worked together for about a month, I made a wise crack, as we so often did, and said \"so, did you save 20 orphans from a burning bus?\" And gestured to my neck. He nonchalantly said \"nah, some dude in a bar slit my throat.\" I started to laugh then stopped and realized he was light hearted, but not joking.

Some people can learn to love theirs, others will spend their entire life trying to come to terms with it.\n\nI have facial scars that can\u2019t actually be seen anymore due to the age I got them and the fact that I was forced to use scar cream to try to hide them, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the scars *changed the physiology of my face*. All of them run through my eyebrows which means when I move them, they don\u2019t always move in the same way/as much as the other. I also have bald \u201cstreaks\u201d that run through them. I\u2019m so self conscious about it that I\u2019ve filled in my eyebrows with makeup since I was 12. Everyone compliments how thick and nicely shaped my eyebrows r. It\u2019s like a dagger to the stomach every single time because on the inside I know that what they think is so amazing and full, is only actually about 60% there. Even the \u201cnice\u201d comments can be harmful. \n\n If you deliberately make someone feel bad (especially for something u know they r insecure about) then I 100% believe all bets r off, they opened that Pandora\u2019s box, anything anyone else says after is just a consequence of their own actions. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nMelissa is TA as is the girl who so bluntly put you in the spotlight.", "NTA. It is never advisable to build oneself up by degrading others.

So she actually has options that are not commonly thought of as available to men. And if he as a man, he used any kind of make up to cover the scar that could even make it worse for him on a social basis. Now on her side as a woman having a scar on her face is a very negative thing. We know that there are societal differences in how men and women are appreciated by potential love interests. But, if you are going to denigrate someone, don\u2019t be surprised if they don\u2019t tolerate your piss poor behavior and throw it back in your face.

When it's 90 degrees and humid outside, and I'm spending hours outside, my makeup is still mostly there at the end of the day, but it's definitely not what it was in the morning.
