We\u2019ve been hanging out more lately and found out more about each other. \n\nActually one of the things we bonded over is the fact we have the exact same facial scar (we even got it at the same age which is a crazy coincidence). We often discuss how it has impacted our self image and self esteem growing up and had lots of conversations. I felt like she understood me.  \n\n\nThe only difference is that she tends to cover her scar with makeup whereas I don\u2019t. (She says that it\u2019s not the same thing since she\u2019s a girl and I get it) \n\nA few days ago we went to a party together and hung out in a room with a few others. One of them was a girl who started chatting with us and Melissa seemed really impressed with her.\n\nAt one point the girl pointed out my scar (which was blunt & made me feel self conscious) but the good thing is that she said positive things. \n\nMelissa immediately joked that \u201cactually\u201d my scar makes me look \u201ccreepy\u201d & \u201cintimidating\u201d. I asked her \u201cdoes that mean you would also look creepy and intimidating if you didn\u2019t hide the same scar with makeup?\u201d . She looked shocked and the people we were with to gave me a look like I had fucked up. \n\nAfterwards in the car we had a massive argument where she called me an \u201cinsensitive asshole\u201d. She said that I\u2019m a shitty person for exposing her insecurity and belittling her feelings. I said that she\u2019s the actual asshole here since she threw me under the bus to impress the girl or whatever (not sure what she was trying to do).

NTA", "NTA. I would say everyone sucks if you *escalated* it, but you only used literally the same words she did. She was being a jerk and totally deserved to hear her own words thrown back at her.", "NTA. You are not wrong to inform people that Melissa has a facial scar under her makeup.   \n How DARE Melissa say that  \u201cactually\u201d \\[your\\] scar makes \\[you\\] look \u201ccreepy\u201d & \u201cintimidating\u201d?\n\nShe is saying out loud what *she* is afraid of... but doing it in an profoundly unkind way.   I think you are just fine pointing out that she has the same scar under her makeup.  \n\nShe has NO right to yell at you for playing fair during an unfair conversation that *she* caused.   \n Melissa needs counseling and you need to spend time with better people than Melissa.\n\nFYI: I married a guy with a massive scar from the center of the top of his forehead that reached straight down to his nose - it was an accident from his childhood.  After a few months, I really could not \"see\" it any more - really.  When we get used to people, spend time with them and enjoy their company, flaws (like scars) become very unimportant.  \n\nThere's a t-shirt in Florida, US that says \"Scars are tattoos, with interesting stories behind them.\"", "NTA. She deserves this. If she can make fun of your scar, you can too. Melissa is acting like only she is allowed to be insecure about something, if she is bold enough to comment on someone's appearance she should be able to take those comments too.", "NTA.  Melissa is TA.  \n\nShe *knows* how the scar has affected your self-esteem.  And yet she still made fun of it.  \n\nUnder any other circumstance you'd be wrong.  But here, when she's using inside info to put you down, you get a pass on using inside info to put her right the same.", "She shouldn't dish it if she can't take it. If she can't handle the heat she should stay out of the kitchen. She started it, you finished it. Periodt. She deserved it for being a fake, two-faced jerk. NTA.", "NTA Maybe she should stop being an insensitive AH. If you can't point out her scar then she ought to shut up about yours. You reap what you sow.", "She sounds like the kind of person who builds themselves up by tearing other people down.\n\nYou could have handled it better but you are NTA. She is.\n\nI have a facial scar too, going through my top and bottom lip. It used to make me feel self conscious. \n\nThe doctor who stitched it up said to my dad \"Well she was never going to win a beauty contest, was she?\"  I was 5. My dad nearly punched him.\n\nNow I just ignore it and so does everyone worth caring about. Anyone else gets ignored.", "NTA\n\nShe is AH\n\nDragging someone down to look better is weak", "NTA \n\nShe shouldn't have started making fun of you period it was rude and hurtful. Her words can also have repercussions \"creeper(creepy)\" with no real context and rumor mills can ruin innocent relations. She's not your friend Especially if she also has the same scar and is sensitive about it but still tried to hurt you.", "NTA. I would say both of you were the asshole if you escalated or took it further, but as is, just asking about her scar in the same context wasn\u2019t an asshole move. She felt embarrassed, and deliberately embarrassing someone is usually a dick move, but there is a difference between being rude/bullying and pointing out someone\u2019s rude/bullying behavior.", "NTA. Merely saying someone has a scar isn\u2019t in any way an insult.  You didn\u2019t say it made her anything.  You pointed out she had one, too.  She feels she has to cover it, fine.  Because you don\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean she can say you\u2019re creepy and intimidating.  Why was she so interested in how this woman reacts to you?  That\u2019s what you need to ask her.", "**NTA** \n\nShe should not be dishing it out if she can\u2019t take it.", "NTA\n\nShe initiated by making fun of you, and when you defended yourself, she got mad and harassed you further.", "NTA. Melissa drew first blood with that wildly inappropriate and hurtful comment. Especially cruel since she knew you were sensitive about it. Could it have been handled better? Sure. But in the heat of the moment, I\u2019m not sure many would have the wherewithal to respond differently. I think a better way to have handled it (hindsight being 20/20) would have been to say in front of everyone \u201cComments like that are really hurtful. It\u2019s taken a lot for me to come to terms with my scar and not be afraid that people will react like you just did. Some people never find that courage and would hide or cover it up. Please be more thoughtful about your words.\u201d Nuff said.", "NTA. If she had used a random insult, it would be ESH. But she used your scar to insult you, use your insecurities and essentially defame your character. Not only is it disgusting, it is hypocritical of her. In return, you pointed out her hypocrisy. I think what you said was fair.", "NTA at all. She crossed a line and knew you were uncomfortable with your scar and should never have said something so insensitive, especially as she has one similar. She\u2019s the asshole.", "NTA - you were essentially being complimented on something you and Melissa both have (that she hides) by a girl she seemed to like. So, in order to make herself feel better, and get the girl\u2019s attention back on her, she turned it around to try to make you creepy and intimidating; you, then legitimately asked the question you asked and now she\u2019s hurt?  Dude, this girl is not your friend\u2026a friend wouldn\u2019t do this to you especially after bonding over how this scar impacted self-esteem/image.", "NTA. If you had done that unprompted you would be TA but she literally said your scar made you look creepy and intimidating while she has the EXACT same scar. What a hypocrite! You just responded to her stupid comment. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "She literally has the same scar, she knows how insecure it can make someone feel and still chose to make fun of you. The right thing to do would have been to tell her that privately, hurting because you're hurt isn't the answer. But man, I probably would have done the same damn thing you did. \n\nIdk. I'd apologize for embarrassing her, but make it very clear that what she did was wrong and you're upset with her.", "NTA\n\nMelissa started this - and in an unpleasant way.  As she knew that the scar had affected your self esteem growing up, it was particularly nasty to say that the scar \"made you look creepy and intimidating\".  You simply replied using her own words.  If those words were hurtful to her, she should not have said them about you.\n\nIt seems Melissa was trying to sabotage your friendships with another girl. Is it possible that Melissa is attracted to you?", "Melissa. Melissa is definitely the AH here.\n\nPlay stupid games, you win stupid prizes.", "I feel like she was a bit jealous of the attention the other girl was giving you. NTA, but maybe ask her why she said it at all. Especially the creepy line.", "NTA i literally laugh at people in these types of scenarios. You really thought you were gonna make fun of me and I was gonna let that slide? Reddit loves to talk about a high horse but I say get low. Love what you did would have probably done the same but except maybe harsher !", "NTA, my body makes cysts. In high school, 2 weeks before my senior prom, I had a cyst removed from the left side of my face. On prom night, some jerk of a jock was making fun of me. My date told him, \"You should see the guy who sliced her. He's been in ICU for three weeks in traction. I wouldn't mess with her, bud.\" I almost split a stitch.", "Melissa is the biggest AH in the story. She didn't have to say what she said. She chose to be an AH in that moment. She chose to project her insecurities about her own scar onto you. \n\nInstead of responding, you could have simply not said anything back. Realizing that she isn't the friend you thought she was and just be done with her after that. However, we often do have a reaction after being made fun of and/or hurt, so you reacted with a statement of truth. \n\nYou stated a fact that called her out in front of others.", "NTA and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s much of a friend. What you did may have been overboard but understandable after her remarks", "NTA she fucked around and found out her fault", "ESH. She started it, but you didn\u2019t have to finish it (this kind of falls into the \u201cunderstandable but not acceptable\u201d category for me). I would have just called out her comment as unkind and insensitive (in front of everyone) and moved on. Then, bring it up with her later - I\u2019d tell her then that if she does it again, you\u2019re going to challenge her with her own scar. Then there\u2019s fair warning, and you can also make clear that you\u2019re just as uncomfortable and she needs to check her hypocrisy at the door.\n\nBut honestly? If she would do this, she\u2019s not a friend, or at least not a good one.
