We\u2019ve been hanging out more lately and found out more about each other. \n\nActually one of the things we bonded over is the fact we have the exact same facial scar (we even got it at the same age which is a crazy coincidence). We often discuss how it has impacted our self image and self esteem growing up and had lots of conversations. I felt like she understood me.  \n\n\nThe only difference is that she tends to cover her scar with makeup whereas I don\u2019t. (She says that it\u2019s not the same thing since she\u2019s a girl and I get it) \n\nA few days ago we went to a party together and hung out in a room with a few others. One of them was a girl who started chatting with us and Melissa seemed really impressed with her.\n\nAt one point the girl pointed out my scar (which was blunt & made me feel self conscious) but the good thing is that she said positive things. \n\nMelissa immediately joked that \u201cactually\u201d my scar makes me look \u201ccreepy\u201d & \u201cintimidating\u201d. I asked her \u201cdoes that mean you would also look creepy and intimidating if you didn\u2019t hide the same scar with makeup?\u201d . She looked shocked and the people we were with to gave me a look like I had fucked up. \n\nAfterwards in the car we had a massive argument where she called me an \u201cinsensitive asshole\u201d. She said that I\u2019m a shitty person for exposing her insecurity and belittling her feelings. I said that she\u2019s the actual asshole here since she threw me under the bus to impress the girl or whatever (not sure what she was trying to do).

I think you are just fine pointing out that she has the same scar under her makeup.  \n\nShe has NO right to yell at you for playing fair during an unfair conversation that *she* caused.   \n Melissa needs counseling and you need to spend time with better people than Melissa.\n\nFYI: I married a guy with a massive scar from the center of the top of his forehead that reached straight down to his nose - it was an accident from his childhood.  After a few months, I really could not \"see\" it any more - really.  When we get used to people, spend time with them and enjoy their company, flaws (like scars) become very unimportant.  \n\nThere's a t-shirt in Florida, US that says \"Scars are tattoos, with interesting stories behind them.\"", "NTA.

Anyone else gets ignored.", "NTA\n\nShe is AH\n\nDragging someone down to look better is weak", "NTA \n\nShe shouldn't have started making fun of you period it was rude and hurtful.

I would say both of you were the asshole if you escalated or took it further, but as is, just asking about her scar in the same context wasn\u2019t an asshole move.

Merely saying someone has a scar isn\u2019t in any way an insult.  You didn\u2019t say it made her anything.  You pointed out she had one, too.  She feels she has to cover it, fine.  Because you don\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean she can say you\u2019re creepy and intimidating.  Why was she so interested in how this woman reacts to you?

Melissa drew first blood with that wildly inappropriate and hurtful comment. Especially cruel since she knew you were sensitive about it. Could it have been handled better? Sure. But in the heat of the moment, I\u2019m not sure many would have the wherewithal to respond differently. I think a better way to have handled it (hindsight being 20/20) would have been to say in front of everyone \u201cComments like that are really hurtful. It\u2019s taken a lot for me to come to terms with my scar and not be afraid that people will react like you just did. Some people never find that courage and would hide or cover it up. Please be more thoughtful about your words.\u201d Nuff said.", "NTA. If she had used a random insult, it would be ESH.

Dude, this girl is not your friend\u2026a friend wouldn\u2019t do this to you especially after bonding over how this scar impacted self-esteem/image.", "NTA. If you had done that unprompted you would be TA but she literally said your scar made you look creepy and intimidating while she has the EXACT same scar. What a hypocrite! You just responded to her stupid comment. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "She literally has the same scar, she knows how insecure it can make someone feel and still chose to make fun of you. The right thing to do would have been to tell her that privately, hurting because you're hurt isn't the answer. But man, I probably would have done the same damn thing you did. \n\nIdk. I'd apologize for embarrassing her, but make it very clear that what she did was wrong and you're upset with her.", "NTA\n\nMelissa started this - and in an unpleasant way.  As she knew that the scar had affected your self esteem growing up, it was particularly nasty to say that the scar \"made you look creepy and intimidating\".  You simply replied using her own words.  If those words were hurtful to her, she should not have said them about you.\n\nIt seems Melissa was trying to sabotage your friendships with another girl. Is it possible that Melissa is attracted to you?", "Melissa. Melissa is definitely the AH here.\n\nPlay stupid games, you win stupid prizes.", "I feel like she was a bit jealous of the attention the other girl was giving you.

I wouldn't mess with her, bud.\" I almost split a stitch.", "Melissa is the biggest AH in the story. She didn't have to say what she said. She chose to be an AH in that moment.

Realizing that she isn't the friend you thought she was and just be done with her after that.

She started it, but you didn\u2019t have to finish it (this kind of falls into the \u201cunderstandable but not acceptable\u201d category for me). I would have just called out her comment as unkind and insensitive (in front of everyone) and moved on. Then, bring it up with her later - I\u2019d tell her then that if she does it again, you\u2019re going to challenge her with her own scar. Then there\u2019s fair warning, and you can also make clear that you\u2019re just as uncomfortable and she needs to check her hypocrisy at the door.\n\nBut honestly?

And while guys absolutely can wear makeup, that's just opening up a whole new slew of bullying opportunities that might be worse than the bullying he'd get from the scar. Where I live, at least, a guy wearing makeup is going to have to deal with a lot of homophobic bs.", ">Afterwards in the car we had a massive argument where she called me an \u201cinsensitive asshole\u201d. She said that I\u2019m a shitty person for exposing her insecurity and belittling her feelings. I said that she\u2019s the actual asshole here since she threw me under the bus to impress the girl or whatever (not sure what she was trying to do). We spent a long time arguing but eventually fell asleep.\n\nNo, you're NTA. You're absolutely correct.\n\nShe called you creepy, because of a physical imperfection that she actively hides. The level of pick me energy radiating from her in that moment could cause cancer and infertility to those present. She doesn't get a pass because she's insecure and a girl, that's just trash thinking right there.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is a bully. \n\nPeople teaching psychology could use this as a great example into why people bully others. \n\nYou were being complimented about something she knew you felt insecure about. She rotated it, insulting you and shaming you over something she felt insecure about herself. I can\u2019t tell you what to do, but I\u2019d consider it friendship over.", "NTA", "NTA she was downright insulting.", "she\u2019s the asshole, you were a retaliatory asshole. Get new friends", "NTA. She's a hypocrite. Why is it ok for her to make you feel bad about your scar but not ok for you to say the exact same thing to her?", "Don\u2019t dish it out if you can\u2019t take it. NTA", "NTA, this is not how a friend behaves.", "NTA: Don't put up with that at any time. People who use your problems to misdirect their insecurities will more than likely screw you over at some point later if they see they can get away with it regardless of what gender you are. She had to learn at some point that public humiliation is going to result in fair game to even the playing field.", "OP you might wish to consider reclassifying Melissa as an acquaintance. \n\nA friend would not have said that about you.", "NTA.", "NTA. But you sure about the friend part.", "NTA. Melissa was obviously jealous of you getting positive attention from new girl. Either the likes you romantically and wanted to \"eliminate competition\" in a way that was very cruel towards you (that was not a joke, that was a stab and she's even too cowardly to admit to it and apologize), or she likes that girl romantically. Either way, the way she went about this is wrong on many levels, enough for me to understand that Melissa is not your friend. From now on, procede with this information in mind and get some distance from her toxicity. Treat her like an acquaintance, nothing more.", "Anyone who insults their friend or weaponizes an insecurity as an ego boost to try and look better or impress someone else isn't your friend lol\n\n\nNTA\n\n\nAnd if she doesn't realize that; I would reconsider my closeness with her. You obviously can't trust her with sensitive information.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: To add, just because she covers up her scar and you don't; in no way does that make your insecurity any less than hers. It ain't the pain Olympics. If she honestly thinks her's matters more than yours... That's kinda disgusting.\n\nYour feelings about your scar are just as valid as her's about her own.", "NTA - she literally insulted and embarassed u in front of a group, and she thinks she's immune from getting that same energy back?\n\nif u throw mud at me, i throw it back with rocks in it. she had it coming. dont dish it out if u cant take it.", "NTA. In the words of Ralph Wiggum \u201cblowback\u201d", "So she can dish it but can't take it huh? I'd just tell her that. If you can't take the heat, don't fan the flame.", "NTA. Your friend was very insulting to you for no good reason. Ask her why she is shocked and upset when you said that to her, when she did worse to you. You had every right to throw it back at her, and maybe if she can't handle you getting positive attention, she should just stay away.", "NTA and she is not your friend.", "Nta", "nta", "NTA.

She made a messed up comment about your scar, knowing how you feel about it.

Next time she will wash her mouth before trying to humiliate someone publicly!! \n\nPs: Someone who do that is not a friend!", "NTA. It\u2019s sad you both talked about it being an insecurity and she felt the need to add mean comments.", "Melissa can dish it out but she cant take it. You\u2019re NTA.", "nta\n\ndon\u2019t dish out what you can\u2019t handle, it\u2019s as simple as that", "NTA\n\nOP, it's best you cut this person out of your life because its not worth the effort. She's a hypocrite and don't let history and emotion cloud your judgement", "no, NTA. cant believe the cheek of her considering you've both had long talks about this exact issue. play stupid games and win stupid prizes, Melissa!", "While it seems fair to throw the same punch back, YTA as much as she is. You chose to stoop to her level and now you both have to live with it.", "I think its both YTA and NTA.\n\nYTA: if this is a girl you care about and are trying to build a relationship with her then you should probably understand her point of view first. Girls can be extremely extremely sensitive about physical issues. I know a few girls who refuse to leave the house without makeup for all occasions, even getting the mail from the front door. It often takes them years to feel comfortable enough with a person to share their un-makeup face. If you want to be that person for her you have to allow people throw some \"jabs\" at you and in order to protect her. Also by showing you aren't affects by those jabs you will build up her own self confidence and be a better place.\n\nGuys can be sensitive too about physical issues but the amount of societal pressure is no where near a girls. Supposedly some jobs with bad bro's (or much worse clique-y girls) will reject a girl interviewee because of her looks (both for looking too good or having some physical difference). Its definitely not equal and there is no use in pretending it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~NTA: if you are really that sensitive about it and she knows that (as in you specifically told her how sensitive you were) then what did she expect to happen? She should understand that you threw out a automatic reaction after being attacked. This is normal, when attacked people attack back. If she understood how senstive you were about it she should defend you by either: saying positive things about it, staying silent, changing the topic.~~ crossed out because can only have 1 judgement. I prefer YTA.", "You both behaved very badly.  It sounds like she was jealous of the other girl.  You were angry at her mean comments, and behaved with meanness in return.  Next time, take the high road.   What if you had walked away from Melissa and escorted the other young lady with you for a private conversation?  That would have sent a message that you aren\u2019t interested in Melissa\u2019s meanness.   If Melissa wants to wrestle in the mud, you don\u2019t need to join her in the dirt.", "She shouldn't have said it and neither should you. You both have a lot of growing up to do.", "NTA, it\u2019s understandable that you pointed that out when someone you\u2019re close to makes comments like that. \n\nHonestly it seems like Melissa has a thing for you. You said she seemed impressed by the girl and that her comments about your scar were positive.  You probably showed some sort of reaction to it and if she has a crush on you then she was probably a way to get the other girl to back off and think differently. It\u2019s super juvenile and unwarranted but makes sense. Then for you to respond probably shook her up. It was deserved but she was probably already feeling threatened by the other girls interest in you and it made your comment hurt her more. Again, your comment was not out of line at all. I\u2019d talk to her about her feelings though. Especially because if she sees anyone as coming on to you and tries to change their opinions by making comments like that, it\u2019s super messed up.", "*This* NTA I'm so sorry that she belittle your feelings like this OP. That's not how a friend should act...", "But shes a girl!! Somehow that makes it different...\n\nNTA. Shes the AH here, not you. So got a taste of her own medicine and it was bitter. Hopefully lesson learnt for her.", "Yeah, OP, is it possible this girl finds you attractive and decided to make fun of you in front of the girl who was hitting on you to throw off your game? Either way, take some space from her. I don't think she's healthy for you.", "Interesting to know, I've always said that tattoos are scars that you chose, I like it the other way around too.", "Oh MAN that's good.", "Wow your date was an awesome person, making you look like a total badass! Lucky you!", "I actually think you're onto something. This sounds like dumb teenage love drama!", "These aren\u2019t witty.", "So he should just allow her to insult him?", "I actually read it as Melissa being into the girl but for whatever reason OP's friend is someone who rips other people down to make herself feel bigger. \n\nOP, NTA.", "Pray do tell me, before these \"recent months\" what decent things have you heard come out of Florida?", "it wasn't a joke. jokes are funny. people laugh at jokes. jokes don't hurt your good friends feelings.\n\nshe's a crap friend and a hypocrite.", "If she thinks that was funny, she's a bully.\n\nShe owes you a proper apology. That was mean.", "Oh come on! There are rarely just two options in a situation like this. \n\nBy reacting from an emotional standpoint, losing ones head and being spiteful to her will only give off a bad impression of OP and reinforce what she said. \n\nSure, call her out on it - it hurt your feelings. For instance; simply stating \u201cHey, that was uncalled for,\u201d in a conversational situation will likely refocus the attention on M (and the group will now probably be thinking the same thing; Hey, that WAS uncalled for, what\u2019s up with this girl?) By all means let the that it fact it hurt your feelings show in your face. All eyes on M now. The conversation\u2019s halted now and a bit awkward. \u201cAll you need to say is \u201cOh. I didn\u2019t realise you saw me that way\u201d. Then quietly excuse yourself. This will leave HER in the embarrassing situation SHE created. \n\nSo now you\u2019ve been \u2018the bigger person\u2019 and \u2018taken the higher road\u2019. You\u2019ve also left her feeling, and most probably looking, like a disingenuous asshole.", ">No. He's brave enough to show his true face to the world and a \"friend\" that he's confided in for Years decides to publicly shame him all to make herself look cool to some random chick?!\n\nThe problem is that OP's friend has the same common mindset according to which men don't have the same self esteem and image problems regarding physical appearance that women have.\n\nI'm overweight and short and I've suffered my all life for it; but I've lost count of how many times my feelings have been downplayed and I've been told (both from \"traditionalist\" and \"feminist\" people) that it's not the same because I'm a man.", "Agree wholeheartedly with you. \nIt doesn't last long...and doesn't cover up the ugly she has on the inside.", "I think you're taking the comment seriously when the person you're replying to was being sarcastic.

So there\u2019s that.", "That is awful that you're treated that way. I'm sorry you've had to deal with that all your life. I don't understand why people assume men can't have feelings or insecurities. It's so common that guys are treated like they're some kind of impervious and unfeeling creatures, then have to keep it to themselves so people don't say you're \"too sensitive\" or some other insult to shut them down.", "Absolutely. There's no internal makeup to cover up who they actually are as a person.", "No way lol my words just got a bit incoherent with anger \ud83d\ude05 my bad. What I meant was,\n\nI disagree with the other poster in saying that he was wrong for standing up for himself because they believe he was fine with his scar since he doesn't cover his up.\n\nThe friend was cruel and I think OP did the right thing by calling her out when she attacked his appearance", "I had to scroll WAY too far to find this!", "You're absolutely right, makeup is not limited to just girls. Choice is the perfect word for this. I wish the girl made better choices. OP didn't deserve to be attacked like that from someone he considered a friend", "There's the double standard that \"dudes look good with scars, adds character etc\" bullish!t while women must be pretty pretty princesses perfect dolls at all times.", "You do realize a big purpose of  makeup is to enhance natural features, right? People can put on makeup without it being noticable. Well-done concealer shouldn't be visible, anyway.", "Notice you used the word \"well-done.\" Applying makeup so it looks natural is a  skill. It takes time and effort to develop and not everyone can do it well. Second, as I mentioned in my previous comment, I'm assuming that he will need heavier makeup to cover the scar (which might not be true). Heavier makeup is harder to apply and make look natural. And if you are applying heavy concealer to a significant portion of your face, you often have to do a full-face to keep it from standing out. Sure, you can dab lightweight concealer on a small spot without much effort, but I'm assuming that's not the case here. I could be wrong since obviously I don't know what his scar looks like. It might already be fairly close to his skin tone, or it could be very discolored. It might be smooth, rough, etc, all factors that impact how much makeup would be needed to cover it."]}
