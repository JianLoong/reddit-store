She and your dad could have split the day so you got each of them for half the day while your half-sister got the other then they could've swapped. Instead your sister demanded to have both of them there today, which was likely intentional on her part.\n\nIf your parents were decent at parenting, there would have been no drama, so any shit they're getting is their own fault.", "INFO your other comment says you are 14 but how old is your sister? \n\nAnd when you say your Dad went is that your dad or her dad? \n\nIt sucks not having a parent there but depending on the age of your sister there could be a pretty reasonable reason they had to stay with her. \n\nDid your mum offer to make it up to you at all?\n\nThere\u2019s so much information missing from this to offer a proper judgement", "NTA.

I know at 14 it's probably hard to understand, but 16 isn't \"grown up.\" I'm absolutely not saying that your feelings aren't valid, but you're both just kids, and your half sister is going through something hard and scary right now, and it probably feels really unfair. You don't get hospitalized for weeks for minor reasons though, I'm wondering if there is more going on with her health than is being shared with you.", "NAH. \n\nI don\u2019t believe your mom was deliberately missing your birthday. \n\nYour sister feels safer with your mom when she\u2019s at the hospital. Understandable since this is her third major health issue since December. \n\nYou are entitled to feel sad that your mom missed your birthday. Even though you knew your mom\u2019s side of the family would be angry with your mom for staying with your sister you are not obligated to lie to them. \n\nI will say your mom\u2019s side of the family sound like A H for not caring about your sister.

Even if your mom feels obligated to be with your half-sister, that comes with consequences. I agree with other who have raised concern over your extended family using this situation to go after your mom and half sister for their own selfish reasons, rather than out of support for you.

No matter what she did, there was going to be a child whose needs she was not meeting. You told your family the truth. Including that she was accompanying a hospital patient, not just having fun. You did not mislead them. (I don't actually think she deserves them giving her a hard time because there literally was not a good choice available to her, and they should be aware of that. But their actions are their responsibility, not yours.)\n\nFrankly I think the family should spend less time trying to make your mom feel bad and more time celebrating you. You and your sister both legitimately needed your mother and she couldn't be there for both of you. I'm glad she could be there for your sister, but it was also very unfair that she wasn't there for you. And you are entitled to have and to share feelings about that -- and I also hope that other adults who care about you can give you a bit extra now, knowing that you're living with even more stressors than usual. \n\nBecause at 14, in some ways you are ready to be treated as an adult -- but you still need support from caring adults.

Your mom and her seem to have a very toxic (to everyone else) relationship.  Your sister probably doesn't like your mom giving any time to anyone else and probably gets jealous.  So she does what she can to guilt your mom into staying.\n\nI kinda get that to a point but she's going to need some serious help (both her and your mom) to be less codependent on each other.\n\nI might've said something different if your sister was a lot younger than you... but she's actually older.  She may have had a traumatic time in her life but this is nothing new.\n\nIt's kinda telling when your mom is more worried about her appearance to her family than what effect missing your birthday had on you.\n\nThere is no reason someone else couldn't have stepped in for a couple of hours so your mom could at least spend a little bit of time with you.  I hope she doesn't expect you to do a lot for her sister on her birthday.  And out of curiosity, what does your sister get from your mom on her birthday... the whole entire day spent spoiling her.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.  Your family asked what was happening and you didn't lie.  You had no reason to.  You told the truth.  You didn't have to hide your mom's lack of spending any time with you.  I'm not sure they were TA's when they contacted your mom because they have seen what is happening and may actually have been standing up for you.\n\nWhat's your dad think of the situation?  What did he do for your birthday?", "YTA based on your comments, I'm gonna get downvoted for this. \n\nYou forgot to mention that your sister has PTSD and you talk about her as if she did this on purpose. Yeah, your mom doesn't feel bad for staying with your sister....that has PTSD. \n\nYou knew that your toxic family was going to harras her, you were maliciously honest. Why?

She fills the mother role, and her family is disgusting for not accepting her as \u201creal\u201d family, just wow.

You wanted to, and did, punish your mom for missing your b day.  You aren't repentant and don't care.  She didn't blow you.off to get her nails done.  Someone is hospitalized.\n\nAlso,  you had a *prime* opportunity to get something good!  Something you want but they've been wishy washy on buying it for you?  Somewhere you want to visit?  This would have been a great bargaining chip, and you wasted it.  So kinda dumb as well as the ahole.", "That says a lot about your situation, NTA you are just a girl who needs her parents like any child, you just turned 14, that means that every time your half sister is in the hospital you are alone. I understand you, you wanted your parents to dedicate quality time to you at least for a couple of hours, it didn't happen. And when your relatives called you only told the truth, you're not bad, you're not a bad sister either.

Being in the hospital is hard, lucky you don't get it but don't judge her for struggling. You can mention that you've been feeling 2nd and ask for some quality time but it's a little over the top to know the drama already between your half sister and the family and say something you know your mom will get scolded for.

You make it sound as if your sister is in the hospital for an ingrown toenail.  And no, she's not.

You need to be able to vent and connect with people who care about you.\n\nBut in terms of the way you're judging and criticizing, and the cavalier way you're describing  what your step-sister has been going through, please give that a lot more thought, maybe with some more compassion and trying to put yourself in her shoes.", "Okay so your 15 yr old sister who has a trauma based injury in her very early years(PTSD) has gone through FOUR hospital stays since December(last six months) and she's clingy with the woman who has likely been the only Mother she's known(since your parents have likely been together since she was under a year?  Basing this on time for your mother to conceive and gestate you).\n\nI get that you were hurt, but deliberately getting your Maternal family pissed at your Mother because she prioritized the SICK and hospitalized child was very petty and AHish behavior.  You have the right to be hurt, you even have the right to say why.  But you appear to have done it for that reason more than because you felt the need to be \"honest\".\n\nYour sister is scared and sick so YES she's going to cling to your mother(her \"mother\" too).  You are jealous and it's not an unreasonable reaction, but try for a little compassion and empathy.  And no you really don't get used to multiple hospital visits in one year.  You get scared and lonely and often are in pain and you don't get sleep or privacy.  It's not a vacay, it's a hospital with often daily blood DRAWS.\n\nPS double pneumonia sucks(feeling like you can't breath is scary as hades).  Chest ports really suck for an adult, and could/would be terrifying for a child.  Surgery on the basic break is not fun but a crush injury likely also means physical therapy on top of the painful recovery process.  Plus you are talking limited mobility so you are stuck in bed, often have someone having to help you to and from bathroom(if you aren't put on a catheter/bedpan regime).  Try to imagine having a tube stuck up an intimate place so that you don't have to/can't walk to bathroom.  Try to imagine having strangers wash you on a daily basis.\n\nPS your maternal family sounds pretty d\\*mn lousy to consider your half sister NOT their family simply because she doesn't share DNA with them.  Unless your half sister was raised by her bio mother and only recently came into your household, she's been in their life nearly as long as you have.  Can't imagine why she might cling to your mother when she appears to be emotionally rejected by half the \"family\".(or if her bio-mother's family in her life--1/3rd).\n\nEdit to add--if I calculate your comment correctly, in the last six months(thru \"now\") your sister has spent nearly 2 months IN the hospital with how much recovery time at home?  So she's spent 1/3rd of the last months of her life IN A HOSPITAL???  \n\nAgain you're entitled to be upset--it was your birthday--but your sister has been repeatedly put back into a situation that exacerbates her PTSD.
