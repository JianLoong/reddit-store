I know at 14 it's probably hard to understand, but 16 isn't \"grown up.\" I'm absolutely not saying that your feelings aren't valid, but you're both just kids, and your half sister is going through something hard and scary right now, and it probably feels really unfair. You don't get hospitalized for weeks for minor reasons though, I'm wondering if there is more going on with her health than is being shared with you.", "NAH. \n\nI don\u2019t believe your mom was deliberately missing your birthday. \n\nYour sister feels safer with your mom when she\u2019s at the hospital.

Even if your mom feels obligated to be with your half-sister, that comes with consequences. I agree with other who have raised concern over your extended family using this situation to go after your mom and half sister for their own selfish reasons, rather than out of support for you.

No matter what she did, there was going to be a child whose needs she was not meeting. You told your family the truth. Including that she was accompanying a hospital patient, not just having fun. You did not mislead them. (I don't actually think she deserves them giving her a hard time because there literally was not a good choice available to her, and they should be aware of that. But their actions are their responsibility, not yours.)\n\nFrankly I think the family should spend less time trying to make your mom feel bad and more time celebrating you. You and your sister both legitimately needed your mother and she couldn't be there for both of you. I'm glad she could be there for your sister, but it was also very unfair that she wasn't there for you. And you are entitled to have and to share feelings about that -- and I also hope that other adults who care about you can give you a bit extra now, knowing that you're living with even more stressors than usual. \n\nBecause at 14, in some ways you are ready to be treated as an adult -- but you still need support from caring adults.

Your mom and her seem to have a very toxic (to everyone else) relationship.  Your sister probably doesn't like your mom giving any time to anyone else and probably gets jealous.

I hope she doesn't expect you to do a lot for her sister on her birthday.  And out of curiosity, what does your sister get from your mom on her birthday... the whole entire day spent spoiling her.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.  Your family asked what was happening and you didn't lie.  You had no reason to.  You told the truth.  You didn't have to hide your mom's lack of spending any time with you.

You wanted to, and did, punish your mom for missing your b day.  You aren't repentant and don't care.  She didn't blow you.off to get her nails done.  Someone is hospitalized.\n\nAlso,  you had a *prime* opportunity to get something good!  Something you want but they've been wishy washy on buying it for you?  Somewhere you want to visit?  This would have been a great bargaining chip, and you wasted it.  So kinda dumb as well as the ahole.", "That says a lot about your situation, NTA you are just a girl who needs her parents like any child, you just turned 14, that means that every time your half sister is in the hospital you are alone.

And when your relatives called you only told the truth, you're not bad, you're not a bad sister either.

You make it sound as if your sister is in the hospital for an ingrown toenail.  And no, she's not.

You need to be able to vent and connect with people who care about you.\n\nBut in terms of the way you're judging and criticizing, and the cavalier way you're describing  what your step-sister has been going through, please give that a lot more thought, maybe with some more compassion and trying to put yourself in her shoes.", "Okay so your 15 yr old sister who has a trauma based injury in her very early years(PTSD) has gone through FOUR hospital stays since December(last six months) and she's clingy with the woman who has likely been the only Mother she's known(since your parents have likely been together since she was under a year?  Basing this on time for your mother to conceive and gestate you).\n\nI get that you were hurt, but deliberately getting your Maternal family pissed at your Mother because she prioritized the SICK and hospitalized child was very petty and AHish behavior.  You have the right to be hurt, you even have the right to say why.  But you appear to have done it for that reason more than because you felt the need to be \"honest\".\n\nYour sister is scared and sick so YES she's going to cling to your mother(her \"mother\" too).  You are jealous and it's not an unreasonable reaction, but try for a little compassion and empathy.  And no you really don't get used to multiple hospital visits in one year.  You get scared and lonely and often are in pain and you don't get sleep or privacy.  It's not a vacay, it's a hospital with often daily blood DRAWS.\n\nPS double pneumonia sucks(feeling like you can't breath is scary as hades).  Chest ports really suck for an adult, and could/would be terrifying for a child.  Surgery on the basic break is not fun but a crush injury likely also means physical therapy on top of the painful recovery process.  Plus you are talking limited mobility so you are stuck in bed, often have someone having to help you to and from bathroom(if you aren't put on a catheter/bedpan regime).  Try to imagine having a tube stuck up an intimate place so that you don't have to/can't walk to bathroom.  Try to imagine having strangers wash you on a daily basis.\n\nPS your maternal family sounds pretty d\\*mn lousy to consider your half sister NOT their family simply because she doesn't share DNA with them.  Unless your half sister was raised by her bio mother and only recently came into your household, she's been in their life nearly as long as you have.  Can't imagine why she might cling to your mother when she appears to be emotionally rejected by half the \"family\".(or if her bio-mother's family in her life--1/3rd).\n\nEdit to add--if I calculate your comment correctly, in the last six months(thru \"now\") your sister has spent nearly 2 months IN the hospital with how much recovery time at home?  So she's spent 1/3rd of the last months of her life IN A HOSPITAL???  \n\nAgain you're entitled to be upset--it was your birthday--but your sister has been repeatedly put back into a situation that exacerbates her PTSD.

At least that's what she was thinking at the time. And  my brother was scared and in pain all  the time too, and angry because his life was so far from normal that he looked at me, who got to sleep in my own bed every night and go to school with my friends and he resented me for that while I resented him for having our mom's attention.\n\nIt sucks for everyone.

Yes, the surgery might be minor, but from what I can tell the surgery isn't why she's in the hospital. There is something *serious* going on. As someone who is in and out of hospitals, they don't keep you unless it's *required*, and in fact they have a bad habit of sending patients home *too soon*.\n\nI think that your parents are hiding just how bad this is, or that you don't understand just how bad it is. Ports are put in when normal IVs aren't enough, or when you're likely to be in there long term, or are expected to need IV treatments on the regular. They're most commonly put in for chemo, or for giving antibiotics when someone has a *serious* infection. They aren't put in for no reason. There is a very real chance that your sister is in serious danger of dying, but that no one is telling you so as to not scare you.\n\nYour mom isn't ignoring you for fun. She's not trying to be mean, but one of her children may be in danger of dying. At the very least the child in question is having *serious* mental health issues due to this whole situation and she sees that she can alleviate that on some level.\n\nShould she have taken some time to come see you for an hour? Maybe. I can't say for sure with the info I have - especially if your sister is scared for her life on top of the PTSD. But it was not kind to sicc her family on her, not when you knew that they were less likely to be angry because she missed your birthday than they were to be angry she missed your birthday for someone *they* resent. I'm not saying it's wrong that you told them the truth, I'm saying that your motivation was incredibly unkind, and your mom has every reason to be mad at you, even as you have a right to be upset that you didn't get to see her.\n\nPlease try to give her a little slack in this situation. From the lack of comments concerning past mistreatment by her, I am left to conclude that this is an atypical situation, rather than a pattern of behaviour. Please try to understand that this is a nightmare situation for any loving parent, and that people dealing with some of their worst fears aren't going to make the best decisions, they're going to react in fear and try to hold on tight to the child they're in danger of losing without taking the time to always be fair.\n\nPlease talk to your mom. I don't mean in a way that's all \"You didn't do this thing for me! And now you suck!\" - in a way where you're explaining how you feel without directly placing blame. But also, *listen* in return. Try to be understanding. Try to make it clear that you understand that your sister needs her (which I'm sure that after all these replies you've gotten, you understand even if you want to dig your heels in and be stubborn) but that you *also* need her, and work together with her to problem solve, to find something that works for both of you.\n\nYou also need to apologise for siccing her family on her - not because you told the truth, but because you did so specifically *to* sicc them on her, as you have yourself admitted. Explain that you were angry, and you were upset, and that telling them the truth was the most understandable action to you at the time, but admit that it was unkind of you to do so with the purpose of hurting her.\n\nAnd lastly, I hope you extend some compassion to your sister. PTSD is beyond difficult. It isn't just being a little scared, it's much, *much* worse. I doubt that your sister called your dad there on your birthday out of malice, especially since you yourself haven't mentioned her having a history of doing this. Please understand that even if she's not so close to death as it needing to be an immediate concern, with so many health issues so close together and the very serious condition that's keeping her hospitalised, she may be genuinely afraid for her life.\n\nI'm not going to assign an asshole state to anyone (even if I think intentionally hurting your mom was *actively* shitty, and terrible to do) and am just going to hope that things get better.

Your sister is scared and doesn't want to be alone, and being in the hospital is absolutely an appropriate time to demand your parents be there for a young person. That does not by any stretch make it less sucky to spend your birthday alone. \n\nI get why you told your extended family the truth, but I also get why your mom was exasperated. She could have been nicer and found a way to still do something special for you, and you should definitely talk to her about how you feel. Give her a chance to make it up to you.

You can celebrate your bday with your family later. There is no requirement to do it on the precise day. Your sister hospital stay can't be moved around to other dates.

I'm sorry if it appeared like I was saying they don't owe her the truth. I understand why they might not be telling her the truth, but ultimately it's making things worse if they don't tell her.\n\nI would argue however that she is not completely without explanation. She's been able to describe several things going on, and I think that there's probably a level of not making it clear how serious those issues are, if that makes any sense? Parents sometimes think they're protecting their kids by not telling them things like this are as serious as they are, which is ultimately the worse option in most cases.\n\nShe absolutely needs parenting too. I hope that her sitting down and talking with them will lead to some sort of middle ground at the least. This feels like something that could at least be made less-awful if everyone sat down and talked reasonably - and if the adults in question tried not to take it too personally if the teen lashes out, focusing on the issues being brought up and talking about the behaviour *after* it all if it's appropriate to.", "That makes YTA.", "I think half the nastiness might stop if OP was shown that they care about her.

Took her to a nearby restaurant for lunch.\n\nBut unless the child was in the middle of a life and death medical emergency mom could have left for an hour or two.\n\nBut even if she could not leave it sounds like op has family not related to the half sister so instead of op being left alone on her birthday mom should have reached out to that side of the family and had someone take op out or do a something for her birthday.\n\nMom dropped the ball miserably here. Op deserves some attention too. Family with sick kids juggle things like this all the times. Mom could have made other arrangements instead of abandoning her child and leaving her alone on her birthday!", "All OP did was tell the truth. Why is OP the asshole for her families actions. They are the ones going at OPs mom. Why does a 14 year old have to be more considerate of her parents feelings when they never considered hers?

What if that does happen, how will we look after the kids and make sure they are ok?", "People have kids with cancer and manage to balance their time. Whether the issues are related or not, it doesn\u2019t change the frequency of her hospital stays nor does it change the fact that she has a living, breathing sibling who occasionally needs to be acknowledged be her parents. If her sister can throw a fit and spam other people\u2019s phones, there\u2019s a great chance that she isn\u2019t in the ICU clinging to life. Furthermore, her mom knows when her daughter\u2019s birthday is. She easily could\u2019ve had her husband be present with their daughter while she took a couple hours to have lunch/quality time with OP. This is a blended family with a chronically ill child; therefore, it\u2019s imperative that the bio parent still in her life shows OP through her actions that she\u2019s still wanted, loved, and a priority. It doesn\u2019t mean leaving the sick child to suffer alone in the hospital, but it does mean taking the time to explain to her that she can\u2019t always have both parent with her constantly. If she\u2019s old enough to spam people\u2019s phones, she\u2019s old enough to understand that Mom can\u2019t spend OP\u2019s entire birthday sitting in a hospital room.", "How would you know? Are you the sister.", "They\u2019ve known about her PTSD for literal years. Mom and dad dropped the ball big time- she should\u2019ve been in therapy ASAP. The fact that she had to be sedated years later when one parent left is indicative of the fact that she\u2019s clearly not getting treatment for her mental health issues or she would have meds and coping strategies to handle one parent at a time. It\u2019s not her fault she has PTSD at all, nor is it OP\u2019s fault to want to see her own mother on her birthday. I, too, have PTSD- it\u2019s not a picnic, but it can be manageable with therapy. If they don\u2019t do something soon, the neglect of their youngest daughter, particularly emotionally, will absolutely create enough resentment to alter their family permanently. OP shouldn\u2019t be made to feel like crap for wanting to see a parent on her birthday. Perhaps knowing that the day was fast approaching, mom and dad should have offered to make it up to her (privately, without her sister, once she\u2019s better to ensure OP gets some undivided attention) or spoken with her doctors to get child life, social workers, and a therapist to come up with a plan to ensure her success. They didn\u2019t do any of that, and it\u2019s not on OP. She\u2019s 14, and operating without a fully formed frontal lobe.", "It sounds like mom is embarrassed her image is tarnished as opposed to actually being remorseful about missing OP\u2019s birthday. Everyone calling OP the AH would be singing a different tune if she were posting about why she no longer has contact with her family at 24 due to her sister being treated wonderfully while OP is tossed to the side. Look, it sucks to be sick; however, throwing one child a party a few weeks after the other was ignored on her birthday is guaranteed to create resentment.

Now i dont give a fuck but let's be honest about what we are doing here. Maybe \"weird\" has some extra baggage for you but if op means weird as in \"atypical \" i think they are just accurately describing how common it is for people to run to hug their parents outside of some particular reason."]}
