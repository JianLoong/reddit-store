If he has YOUR genetic data. Run all the genetic tests that your doctor can, and build your own data about you. Any genetic disorders your father might have had you might not have inherited, any you have you might have mutated yourself and so on. While it\u2019s NICE to have your parents\u2019 genetic information, there are thousands upon thousands of adopted or lost children out there who will never get it, and they face this same dilemma, so there\u2019s processes in place.   \n\n\nDo you know the story of your conception?

I can understand that maybe if she had prior trauma with your birth father or maybe there was some type of situation where she didn't like to relive some sort of memories, but you are still owed & have a right to know your medical history for yourself & your family.

If you were born around then and can stand a very difficult read, I suggest \"The Girls Who Went Away.\" It's full of real life testimonials of women who gave up their babies in that time frame. It's completely heart breaking.\n\nSo the nice thing is you have other avenues. With the genetics, you can get a lot of health reports for cheap or free using your raw DNA file you can download from the site you tested. Promethease was cheap last time I checked. [CodeGen.eu](https://CodeGen.eu) is less comprehensive but free I think.\n\nYou can also find your birth father without your mother's help and without posting publicly. There's a facebook group called \"DNA Detectives.\" They give lots and lots of tips on how to triangulate your own DNA matches to determine who your birth parents are. The fact that your mother tested will make it that much easier for your to figure out who your father is. You may even find someone willing to be your \"search angel\" who will look for you.\n\nGood luck!\n\nETA:\n\nAlso upload to other sites like GedMatch; you'll get more matches there.

The more obvious ones, and the more dangerous ones are usually well defined.

There are doctors who specialise in rare (genetic) diseases, maybe get a referral to one of those so they aren\u2019t fishing through many tests but can quickly narrow down to a few for the specifics of what you are looking for.   \nAnother important thing to remember is that not all things found on a DNA test will you actually need medical help for. EVERYONE \u2018fails\u2019 a DNA test, EVERYONE has mutations, but not every mutation needs to be named and classified and known, only the ones that are actually messing with you.   \n\n\nEven if you did get your bio father\u2019s genetic material you\u2018d have to pay to run all those tests\u2026 why not just test yourself or your kids as needed instead?", "I never said next husband.

I am saying when I found my birth mother and her then ex husband (who was married to her when I was concived and for the other two childre)  didn't mention any second guesses about having been my birth father.", "Don\u2019t think he was ever step dad, as OP given up for adoption. Regardless, he\u2019s dead if I understand OPs comments. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve read anything saying bio dad was married to birth mom. Seems that would be easy to trace, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s case.", "Op says she was married in an earlier comment to me. She says \u201c They got a divorce and he also died before I found out the truth\u201d and maybe she is referring to the  \u2018stepdad\u2019 or the bio dad, but in that same section she\u2019s talking about the bio dad so I took it to mean that it related to bio dad."]}
