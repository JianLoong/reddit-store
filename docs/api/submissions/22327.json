We never got along growing up. In fact, before yesterday, I haven't seen him in 3 years. My salary is \\~$180k and my husband makes more than me. We also have fruitful investments that generate quite a bit of passive income. My husband (42M) had full custody of his daughter \"Harmony\" from a previous relationship and she is an angel. We bonded and she really felt like she was my daughter as well. She is now 22, graduated from college Magna Cum Laude, and wants to work in fashion. She LOVES haute couture and wants to work in Paris. The problem? Paris is expensive and a lot of the positions that would consider her don't pay well, especially with how expensive Paris is. My husband and I decided to surprise her and sponsor her living expenses and additional allowance, so she doesn't have to worry about income and can focus on her dream. She was ecstatic and posted on social media about it.Well, Tony's daughter \"Joy\" (25F) saw the post and told him. She has also been wanting to work in Paris for years. I found this out because my parents invited my husband and I to dinner, and when we arrived, Tony was there too. The topic of us sending Harmony to Paris conveniently came up. They suggested that we sponsor Joy to go to Paris too because Harmony and Joy were basically cousins and could bond over a shared experience. I calmly said \"No, we aren't responsible for financing Joy. Tony can pay for Joy if he wants her to go to Paris.\" He aggressively responded that he doesn't make enough money for that and we are just showboating our money. I said that it is not our responsibility to send Joy to Paris simply because Harmony was going. They are not sisters and don't even have a relationship with each other. So if Tony couldn't afford it, tough s\\*\\*t.This led to a long drawn out argument and then it came out that Tony had already told Joy a month ago that we promised to pay. He also said that \"I would be a sh\\*tty uncle if I didn't pay for my niece but would pay for someone who isn't even my biological daughter\". Now, this is where I might be the AH because my blood boiled. I said that Joy was NOT my niece because he is NOT any brother of mine. My husband and I left and, shortly after, Joy called me begging to pay to let her go. I was still enraged and yelled \"I don't understand how you and your father think you can use me as an ATM when neither of you have ever been family to me. Pay for yourself!\" and I hung up. After a few more hours, I have cooled down and started seeing the family backlash against me on social media. A lot of people say that I am punishing Joy because I hate Tony. I'm still not going to pay for her, but Joy technically is innocent in all of this, I guess. And a lot of my resentment is towards Tony, not her.

I hadn't really focused on my parents' involvement in all of this. This isn't the first time they have tried to bring Tony and I closer. I think they just thought that he and I could resolve some tension through the bonding of Joy and Harmony. I'm used to their tactics by now.\n\nSecond, Joy and I do not have a relationship. As a child, she was kept away from me by my brother and his now ex-wife. As an adult, she hasn't made any effort to reach out to me until now.\n\nSo, I think my rage response to Joy came out because I simply saw her as an extension of my brother. Tony is pretty homophobic and generally bullied me for being gay growing up and stayed away from me once he moved out of the house. He and I don't have a relationship and I have no desire to build one. Now I probably should've been more measured in my response to Joy, as she probably didnt know that Tony lied to her. I can see apologizing to her for yelling and saying she is not family to me, but that's all I can see...", "NTA.

Just suddenly there it is: gimme gimme.\n\nOf course, you have a wonderful relationship with your daughter and not much of one with your niece, so the thinking that it's only symmetrical that you should pay for Joy is stupid.

At first, I wasn't going to mention age because I didn't want to seem like I was taking a jab at my brother's life decisions (wasn't relevant to the post that he was a teen dad), but I also didn't want to make it seem like Joy was a 11-year old girl.

She and her father NEEDS to apologise to you.", "Ugh. No! You don\u2019t need to finance a child that isn\u2019t yours so they can have their own \u201cEmily in Paris.\u201d Tony is delusion. Joy is a brat. You don\u2019t owe anyone anything. The family is insane. Actually on second thought, you do owe them something - a recommendation for a psychiatrist.", "NTA. Also your niece is a 25 year old women , she can take care of herself.", "So, I have a good relationship with my uncles. One of them could easily pay for me to live somewhere comfortably for a year, but it never occurred to me that he should. NTA All of this is ridiculous.", "NTA for not paying for Joy, but you should apologize for yelling at her. Her father promised her a lie and that's not her fault. She might have even been told another lie so she would call and ask. \n\nYou are in no way obligated to pay for anything for her. \n\nAlso, I know you don't need to hear this, but your daughter is very much your daughter. Blood isn't the only thing that makes a family. I'm so excited for all of you that you could give her this opportunity.", "NTA\n\nIt's your money and your stepdaughter.\n\nYou're not responsible for your niece.\n\nIf you don't like your brother--fuck him.", "NTA. Even though Joy was kept from you as a child, she is 25 so has been able to make her own decisions regarding who she has a relationship with for a long time now and has chosen to not have one with you. \n\nLets also not forget that Tony told her A MONTH AGO that you would pay for her and she still did not contact you to even thank you. The fact that her dad lied does not dismiss this fact. \n\nI hope your daughter loves her time in Paris!", "NTA", "NTA - most people on this sub argue over streaming passwords and wedding invites. Not supporting your  Grown Ass living in Paris! The audacity!", "NTA you're not close to either of them and she's not your kid. You don't owe them anything. Your family canfu d her trip and stop treating you as the family ATM. Cut contact with them all and live your life. They should've made better decisions", "Hi it\u2019s me, ur long lost son. I am 34 and have my own family and career but you and your husband seem like the kind of people I\u2019d like to be around. I hope I can support my daughters dreams one day like you are. \n\nNTA and I hope you never have to think about this ever again.", "Where exactly do people get off and where does this entitlement come from??? Seriously I am stunned at some of these posts....!!! \nI'm absolutely baffled for you OP..\nWho are these people to even think for a second?.\nNTA\nP.s I don't think your niece needs or deserves and apology or an explanation...what the f**k she just thinks some random person she's never met or had any kind of relationship with is going to, for no reason I might add, pay for her life choices???? And she didn't once question that ...at all....Like Seriously w.t.f???", "Joy and Tony are assholes. Block them.", "NTA You already said how expensive Paris is. Your husband makes more than you and he is paying for HIS DAUGHTER and you are contributing to your STEP DAUGHTER, but you are not paying the entire thing. The reality is you cannot afford to pay for your niece. You don\u2019t have the money. $180,000 is not a lot of money. You are not millionaires. And a niece is not the same as a step daughter and Harmony is more your family than Joy is. Tell the other family members who are giving you a hard time that they can take up a collection and send Joy to Paris, but you and your husband just can\u2019t afford it. Even if in reality you could easily pay for two women to live in Paris, tell them you have already budgeted for Harmony and that is all the money you have. Offer to put a couple hundred dollars in the collection plate for Joy, but they have to come up with the rest. If they care about family so much, that is the least they can do for her.", "NTA, and cut all contact with Tony.", "Not your responsibility", "NTA, honestly sounds like your family is very manipulative. Why they seem to feel entitled to what you earn is beyond me. Be sure to set boundaries with them and be firm.", "Not saying Joy needed to call you.  But any phone call from her should have been an apology to you for her dad's behavior.", "NTA- It's not your fault that Tony lied to his daughter. You're right, you are not their ATM. While it's always unpleasant when hostilities flair, sometimes one simply must raise their voice in the interest of clarity. I think you have achieved that admirably. It's up to good old Tony to find a way or, sadly, Joy will have none.", "NTA! They used a innocent child against you but you stood your ground. Just DON\u2019T cave in. You can always tell your parents and family that they can pay for Joy. Life is really simple. If she wants to go, work for it. They\u2019re really high thinking you\u2019re an ATM. I think you can manage to tell Joy why this is ridiculous. If she doesn\u2019t understand, you know what to do.", "Interesting how this works. \u201cYou have money. I decided that, because you have money, you should give it to me/mine. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re awful.\u201d  LOVE to hear how people love to appropriate others\u2019 money as theirs.\nNTA.", "NTA.  I\u2019d just ignore all of them. It\u2019s your money and you don\u2019t owe them anything. The fact that Joy even called you to beg to get her to Paris is the piece de resistance.  They aren\u2019t your family and you have no responsibility to carry their dead weight.", "NTA. You get to spend your money how you want to.", "While she may be 'innocent' in all this - she is a full grown adult. She is 25. What is odd is she didn't reach out a month ago to talk/thank/any communication with you regarding you sponsoring her? That sounds SUS. She is not your responsibility. Your family is trying to use you. NTA", "Definitely NTA, TONY should man up and let his daughter realize life isn't going to be easy.", "NTA\n\nI suspect your parents played a big part in all of this.  They probably assured your brother that they can convince you to pay or were sure you'd do so with little promoting.\n\nThis problem would easily be solved if your parents paid for the trip and gave you credit.\n\nTime to make the grandparents put their money where their big mouths are.", "Tony may have lied about telling Joy.", "Joy became TA too when she blamed OP and his husband for her not going to Paris instead of turning on her crappy father for falsely promising that she could go.", "No one's surprised by her attempt at bargaining as a reaction to this. Good on you for standing up for yourself, now take a big step away from her and her father - who has clearly passed on his sense of entitlement to her.", "Why would he want to do that?  \n\nShe has been under the impression that he is going to pay for her to live in Paris for a month.  She did not ever even reach out to thank him!!\n\nWhy would anyone try to force a relationship with someone that entitled and ungrateful? I would not want her in my life!!\n\nEdit:  NTA", "Nta - Yeah, if I thought someone was going to pay my way to Paris, I would be on the phone thanking them profusely the day I first heard about it. Not even sending a text makes Joy an AH too. And all those complaining relatives can pool their money and finance her if they think she deserves it.", "Ooh, I missed that part.", "Even worse she kept demanding it.\n\nIf I found out a parent lied about a large gift I was supposed to receive, I WOULD BE so EMBARRASSED.  How can you not be?  That your parent tried to force someone to make a huge gift they had no intention of making.\n\nWhat would Tony promise Joy next if OP gave in?\n\nWedding-paid by uncle\n\nHouse/down payment--uncle said he'd pay for it.\n\nIVF--uncie's got ya.", "Poor thing, good for her for perfecting her French I guess! I would imagine it's dirtier than Stockholm sure.", "\ud83e\udd6a\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7", "I'm 35, and financially well less off than my parents (though they are also very much working class), and they still pay when we go out to eat lol - but they don't drink, so if I have drinks I'll usually pay for those.\n\nBut, when I do come into a bit of money, I usually will gift them something pretty decent - good Broadway or concert tickets, usually, as they both really enjoy that sort of thing. They do the same for me. It isn't really about who owes who what - it's about, I have this right now, let's all enjoy it.", "LOVE this \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This sub gets nuts with the comparisons or one upping. \"I wouldn't expect my uncle to do the exact same thing the post is discussing\" \"exactly! I bought mine a trip to space\" \"exactly that's what we do too!\" ... wait what?!", "She was innocent. Right up until she called you to guilt trip you. She's 25, not 15. She knows what she's doing. The gall to call up someone she has No relationship with, to demand money. Nope. Sorry he dad raised her poorly, but that's no excuse now.", "Joy is a grown woman acting like she is entitled so someone else\u2019s money\u2026. Related or not", "She couldn\u2019t care less about an apology. What she wants is for you to sponsor her. She has no shame, and it seems like the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.", "Especially since she didn\u2019t bother to call and say thank you when she first thought OP was  sponsoring her.", "Even if OP didn't think of Harmony like a daughter.  Hubby(/father) earns more than OP, so they are likely paying for it more from HIS earnings than OPs\n\nAND Why should OP's husband have to pay for Tony's child--she's no blood of his?(if we use Tony's logic that Harmony isn't OP's child/blood).", "Eh, there\u2019d be nothing wrong with saying sorry that her dad decided to lie to her and throw her in the middle of the brother\u2019s bad relationship and that he didn\u2019t have any ill will towards her.\n\nShe was told he would send her to Paris. Next thing you know her dad tells her there\u2019s been a fight between them and he\u2019s no longer going to pay for the her, all over some bad blood between the brothers. She feels like her dumbass dad just lost her a dream experience and calls the OP in a panic. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to have that reaction if that\u2019s how she understands it.\n\nOP, don\u2019t pay for her or anything but let her know she\u2019s got the wrong villain.", "I also feel like you can\u2019t really just break into the fashion world by having enough gumption. Isn\u2019t it the kind of industry that heavily relies on connections and name recognition?", "Also, she thought OP was sponsoring her in Paris and never called to say thank you?!", "Also, she thought OP was sponsoring her in Paris and never called to say thank you?!", "That dad could have lied to her again and told her that the offer is rescinded because of an argument. I would just tell her the truth of what happened.", "Not true. You can specifically name people and state you give them nothing. This happened to me when my mom died.", "For a whole month too. She only called when \u201cOp changed their mind\u201d. The audacity. That kind of person thinks the world is handed to them on a platter just by breathing.", "EXCELLENT point! Very true.", "When she didn\u2019t call to say thank you she doesn\u2019t have a right to call and beg for the money after OP said \u201cno\u201d. And she is n contact with her grandparents, she could have asked for his contact info from them.", "Looking for this comment!!! Exactly!!! NTA", "But... there are 2 million Parisiennes, 30 million visitors. \n\nI believe that is the highest ratio anywhere in a major European city.", "Exactly. If I for a second thought an estranged family member was sponsoring a dream for me, I would first of all be shocked and incredibly grateful, then I would immediately call to express undying gratitude with the promise that a handwritten thank you card was on the way in the mail. And that\u2019s just to start.", "When I went there was garbage and feces on the sidewalks and streets almost all the time. They had a truck go around at night rinsing everything off because of it", "This was, no joke, my favorite part about marrying into a family where this was tradition. My in-laws are wonderful people and 100% refused to let us pay for dinner, so it became (very good-natured, to clarify) fucking Spy versus Spy shit whenever we'd go out to dinner as to who got the check.\n\nWaiter brings the check and you snatch it from me? Okay, next time I'll give the waiter my card before we're seated.\n\nYou leave the card on file with the waiter before we even get to the restaurant? I'll arrive early, give them my card, and tell them to use that one instead.\n\nYou call the restaurant, make a reservation, and leave a card on file, telling them to not let anyone else pay? I'll cancel that reservation, make one under my name, and give them my card.\n\nMy in-laws are wonderful people. They grew up dirt poor (even though they're comfortable now) and helped my wife and I out in so many ways when we were finding our feet as adults. They finally agreed, when we graduated and landed good jobs, that - with the exception of one \"family\" restaurant they've been going to for 30 years - my wife and I can always cover the check when we're out.", "It's the \"giving economy\" rather than the transactional interactions.  It sounds lovely and I'm sure it brings added closeness to those involved.  Kudos to you."]}
