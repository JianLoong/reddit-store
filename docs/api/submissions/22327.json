We never got along growing up. In fact, before yesterday, I haven't seen him in 3 years. My salary is \\~$180k and my husband makes more than me. We also have fruitful investments that generate quite a bit of passive income. My husband (42M) had full custody of his daughter \"Harmony\" from a previous relationship and she is an angel. We bonded and she really felt like she was my daughter as well. She is now 22, graduated from college Magna Cum Laude, and wants to work in fashion. She LOVES haute couture and wants to work in Paris. The problem? Paris is expensive and a lot of the positions that would consider her don't pay well, especially with how expensive Paris is. My husband and I decided to surprise her and sponsor her living expenses and additional allowance, so she doesn't have to worry about income and can focus on her dream. She was ecstatic and posted on social media about it.Well, Tony's daughter \"Joy\" (25F) saw the post and told him. She has also been wanting to work in Paris for years. I found this out because my parents invited my husband and I to dinner, and when we arrived, Tony was there too. The topic of us sending Harmony to Paris conveniently came up. They suggested that we sponsor Joy to go to Paris too because Harmony and Joy were basically cousins and could bond over a shared experience. I calmly said \"No, we aren't responsible for financing Joy. Tony can pay for Joy if he wants her to go to Paris.\" He aggressively responded that he doesn't make enough money for that and we are just showboating our money. I said that it is not our responsibility to send Joy to Paris simply because Harmony was going. They are not sisters and don't even have a relationship with each other. So if Tony couldn't afford it, tough s\\*\\*t.This led to a long drawn out argument and then it came out that Tony had already told Joy a month ago that we promised to pay. He also said that \"I would be a sh\\*tty uncle if I didn't pay for my niece but would pay for someone who isn't even my biological daughter\". Now, this is where I might be the AH because my blood boiled. I said that Joy was NOT my niece because he is NOT any brother of mine. My husband and I left and, shortly after, Joy called me begging to pay to let her go. I was still enraged and yelled \"I don't understand how you and your father think you can use me as an ATM when neither of you have ever been family to me. Pay for yourself!\" and I hung up. After a few more hours, I have cooled down and started seeing the family backlash against me on social media. A lot of people say that I am punishing Joy because I hate Tony. I'm still not going to pay for her, but Joy technically is innocent in all of this, I guess. And a lot of my resentment is towards Tony, not her.

I hadn't really focused on my parents' involvement in all of this. This isn't the first time they have tried to bring Tony and I closer. I think they just thought that he and I could resolve some tension through the bonding of Joy and Harmony. I'm used to their tactics by now.\n\nSecond, Joy and I do not have a relationship. As a child, she was kept away from me by my brother and his now ex-wife. As an adult, she hasn't made any effort to reach out to me until now.\n\nSo, I think my rage response to Joy came out because I simply saw her as an extension of my brother. Tony is pretty homophobic and generally bullied me for being gay growing up and stayed away from me once he moved out of the house. He and I don't have a relationship and I have no desire to build one. Now I probably should've been more measured in my response to Joy, as she probably didnt know that Tony lied to her. I can see apologizing to her for yelling and saying she is not family to me, but that's all I can see...", "NTA.

Just suddenly there it is: gimme gimme.\n\nOf course, you have a wonderful relationship with your daughter and not much of one with your niece, so the thinking that it's only symmetrical that you should pay for Joy is stupid.

At first, I wasn't going to mention age because I didn't want to seem like I was taking a jab at my brother's life decisions (wasn't relevant to the post that he was a teen dad), but I also didn't want to make it seem like Joy was a 11-year old girl.

Don't backtrack and if your family continues to try to shame you, I'd advise changing your number.", "OP- Will you sponsor me so I can live in Paris for a few years?", "Could have handled it better however nta, your brother gone screwed the pooch and he probably set up his daughter", "\"Joy\" is an adult and can get a job, save money and sponsor herself. The level of entitlement is unreal. NTA.", "NTA, but perhaps you and your husband should talk to Harmony. If she is serious about joining fashion industry, Milan would be a better choice.", "NTA, your brother wanted to use you as you said to finance for his daughter and I would question if your parents knew of this and set it up. You maybe the AH for how you spoke to Joy as she may not have been told the actual story of what happened so it maybe worth explaining it to her and apologising.", "Hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha OMG\n\nNo. NTA.\n\nI'm sorry to laugh, I know I *know* how much it hurts when entitled people you are related to say you're the problem.\n\nBut this is the easiest NTA, ever, for me, in my admittedly short time as a redditor who spends way too much time here.\n\nSleep easy. I hope Harmony has a lovely start to her life in Paris.\n\nEdit: whoops I mixed up your stepdaughter and Tony's daughter.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t quite say Joy is totally innocent but she\u2019s definitely not the aggressor or primary AH. Calling you for money after you said no was strange, but I don\u2019t know if I can call her a full AH if she wasn\u2019t given the proper information. Also it\u2019s not a punishment to not pay thousands of dollars you never promised idk why people are saying you\u2019re punishing her for your dislike of her dad", "No one else is entitled to your money just because you have it. No one. NTA.", "I\u2019d have considered you t a IF you\u2019d gone off on Joy with zero provocation from her. However, she rang you making demands. \n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "It\u2019s over. You\u2019ve said what your position is and that\u2019s it. You owe no apologies to anyone. Tell your parents to stay out of your business. Cut their drama out of your life.", "Magna cum lord", "Why would they think you\u2019d pay for her to go also? People are delusional nowadays. NTA. Her dad is the AH for promising something that wasn\u2019t offered in the first place. Glad your daughter gets a good opportunity.", "NTA. It\u2019s insane how many people think they have a right, er RIGHT, to other people money for whatever reason their can think of and the sad reality of people having to come to AmI\u2026 to make sure it\u2019s ok to not pay the way for other people.", "You are not punishing anyone. Joy is your niece. On what planet is she expecting you to finance her life and dreams as an adult? \n\nHarmony is your daughter/stepdaughter. She isn't entitled to your money but you have chosen to support her as your child. it doesn't entitle anyone else to anything. If your family cant see this they are assholes but the biggest one is your brother whose manipulation tactics have backfired. Don't promise someone else's money to anyone. Social media backlash - says it all. Block them. NTA", "YOU ARE NOT AN ASSHOLE.  Period, end of sentence.", "NTA - This isn\u2019t a case of you taking custody of your niece by choice when she was a young child and now showing favoritism towards your daughter. This is a case where you have little to no relationship with your relatives and they attempted to apply pressure to get you to take on the fiscal responsibility of someone for whom you\u2019ve never had any responsibility for", "Nta but should call apologize for yelling at that little girl ( how would you feel if a grown man yelled at your daughter for the same thing)", "You are not responsible for your niece. You're more responsible for your step daughter. \nTo pay for your niece is going to make your brother an even worst person. He's too entitled.", "NTA this is absurd.  It would be like a random person from Harmony\u2018s school demanding funding.  You have no relationship and no obligation.  Even if you knew and loved joy and your brother you STILL are not under any obligation", "NTA- you don't have any relationship with joy. If you had a close relationship i'd say, consider it. You are being treated like an ATM by your fAmILy. You also have no clue how joy will behave. Are you willing to sponsor her going there to party her ass off on your dime?", "OMG NTA! Get away from that mental health monster of a family! They are toxic!", "Your brother is definitely the asshole, and so are your parents for setting you up at dinner. Seriously, what a bunch of losers", "NTA wtf?! When things have calmed down and you're all talking again let Tony know that the route through all of this was that you all let Harmony get settled over there and then Joy asks her if it's ok to come stay for a bit. Nobody needs sponsoring she's 25 years old she can save up some money for flights and food etc and if she wants to make a go of living in Paris she can get a job there?! Obvs it's too late for now but seems like he needs to learn the art of being normal", "NTA but Im genuinely confused..what is up with families and taking private matters on social media nowadays? geez..", "NTA. And I\u2019m not letting Joy off the hook like other commenters seem to be doing. She really thought you were going to pay for her when she didn\u2019t try to have a relationship with anyone in your family? And then, when she was told oh you are (this part was not her fault) she doesn\u2019t text or call or send a note like hi Uncle, THANK YOU. Better off without the lot of them I say.", "NTA.  You are paying for YOUR daughter.  Daughter is different than niece.  Your brother should have never told his daughter that you were going to pay for her.\n\nThe entitlement of people is unreal.", "NTA.  Tony had a lot of nerve promising your money to his daughter.  You have no legal or moral responsibility to Joy.  If Tony thinks it's so important, maybe he needs to get a second job to make it happen.", "Why do you hate paragraphs? That\u2019s unreadable.", "NTA stand your ground!", "Tony demoted himself to \"relative\" and doesn't get to write checks your as has to cash.", "I always marvel at these situations. I have a great relationship with my sister and BIL. I make a good living - they are wealthy (they work very hard and none of us grew up with money). I have never once thought my sister owed me anything. I could foresee limited situations where I might ask her for help, and my feelings might be hurt if she said no, but I would never take to social and badmouth her. \n\nIn other words, your brother is demonstrating why you can\u2019t stand him. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Be petty. Link this post to them and in social media. \n\nI'm tired of these people who think they're entitled to their relative's money.", "Your parents are assholes because they set this \"dinner\" up.\n\nEdit: NTA. The niece is an adult and not your child.", "1000% this!  How dare your estranged brother promise his daughter, who from your follow up comment, you don\u2019t have a relationship with that you\u2019d finance her living in Paris.  The entitlement of people these days is mind blowing.  If your parents want to finance Joy\u2019s  Parisian life so be it but they have no business placing such expectations on you.  Your parents are a huge part of this problem.  Joy is 25, if she really wants to live in Paris why hasn\u2019t she been saving up?  NTA.", "Joy doesn't need an apology either. Joy was under the impression that Uncle was paying for her to go to Paris for an entire month and didn't reach out to thank him at all. I'd have been over the moon and contacting them regularly to thank them. She obviously has his number since she called him asking him to pay for her. Brother and niece are both the AH.", "Agree.", "agreed, I think OP owes Joy an apology for yelling but she was absolutely entitled in that interactionNTA", "I think it\u2019s insane that anyone thinks you owe her an apology. She thought she was entitled to your money too. She\u2019s just like her father. You should just block all of them because it is absolutely ridiculous They think you should pay for her and the way they treat you.", "The only apology you owe Joy is this \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re upset about this situation, but that is something you need to address with your father. He never asked me to pay for you, he lied in the hopes that I would roll over to not cause drama. This entire situation is on him, and I will not discuss it further\u201d", "Apologize for yelling. Apologize for saying *angrily* that she is not family to you but do explain that you don't think of her as family since there is not and has never been a relationship there.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely not. Maybe if you\u2019d gone off on her, but she rang you and not even to ask if her dad was wrong, but just to Have A Go. She\u2019s 25 and old enough to know better. Never mind that but she\u2019s spent a month thinking you were going to do this, and she never once rang emailed or called to thank you? Screw that.", "NTA.  If your parents want her to go so bad, they can pay for her.  It's your money, you get to choose how it's spent.   Your brother is extremely entitled, plus he treated you like shit for your sexuality, & your haven't spoke in three years.  Lotta nerve on him.", "Your brother and his ex wife kept Joy away from you when they were 15 and you were 13?", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything else to apologize for, but I do think it would be good of you to apologize for that (although not necessarily required).", "Even if you had a good relationship with her this demand is ridiculous. My cousins got to do better things in life than myself because their parents had more money and I would never dream of especially as an adult to demand that since my cousins got to go to better schools and what not that my aunts and uncles should fund my life too and I actually have a good relationship with them. These people the entitlement and audacity is strong with them!", "I was wondering if your brother was homophobic. Even more reason not to do anything for him (like pay for his daughter).", "YTA for not having a relationship with her because you see her as an extension of someone else.", "You do not owe Joy an apology.  Tony owes her one for lying to and deceiving her about living in Paris.", "NTA. Be petty. Link this post to them and in social media. \n\nI'm tired of these people who think they're entitled to their relative's money.", "You don\u2019t owe her anything. The people saying that are delusional", "Culturally, I think family should support family. Do you want a relationship with Joy at all?", "As an uncle as it relates to OP; I think you're missing some relevant facets of this (though I'm not disagreeing with conclusions)", "\u2026and are totally the reason Tony is the way Tony is. :(", "It also would not matter even if they were close to her. It is not their responsibility to pay for her life. The entitlement is amazing.  NTA", "A very good point.  If someone offered me such an opportunity, I'd be thanking them quickly and profusely.", "Joy is low key TA along with her dad because \n\n1. She\u2019s old to have a relationship with OP but never chose to have one. \n\n2.She thought OP was going to finance her life in Paris and never bothered to say thank you.", "In wondering if Tony said that just to pressure his younger brother even more\u2026", "If Joy wants a sponsor to live in Paris, she needs to find an employer willing to do so.  She may want to look into labor shortage areas there and acquire those skillsets if she doesn't have one on the list.  Work visas are possible for those who qualify.", "i've heard if you leave people a penny in your will, they can't contest and say you forgot them. not sure how true it is in OP's country but worth looking into!", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f bravo", "Exactly this - Milan or London make more sense though I think Paris is still seen as one of the top 4 cities for fashion but might be due to tradition if it\u2019s really gone downhill. However, OP what kind of fashion is Harmony wanted to design? - luxury, haute couture, ready to wear, etc. Would make more sense for her to go to a city that is more known for the type of fashion she\u2019s wanting to design.", "Now that\u2019s interesting. One of my oldest and best friends is Parisian tho has lived mainly in U.K. for years \u2026. She has family/visits etc. She hated\u201d Emily in Paris\u201d ( I\u2019ve not seen it) - but I do know, her family all loathe the foreign nepos. My friend said, those who truly want to learn, learn about our country and culture and language - we don\u2019t expect anyone to be fluent but being shouted at by loud rude ( foreign rich nepo tourists) does not go down well , even if someone just learns how to say a few basic words, we know they\u2019ve made an effort. \n\nI make her right. But pal hasn\u2019t lived in Paris for many years. Your thoughts?", "That's disappointing to hear \u2639\ufe0f. It looks so glamorous and exciting as the fashion capital of the world. I'm kinda jealous of the nepo-babies who can live, study and party wherever they want....", "I agree to that, op, you are technically only sponsoring a long vacation. No fashion icon will find her and bring her work to the catwalk, this isn't a movie.", "When Joy was a baby/toddler, she didnt live in our house. She lived with her mom and maternal grandparents. I saw her when she was my brother and my parents, but it\u2019s not like Joy remembers me from when she was 2. By the time my brother was 18 and out of the house, I barely saw her at all.", "The question should be: Does Joy want a relationship with her uncle if it doesn\u2019t involve him signing a check for thousands of dollars? The answer is no. Why should OP want a relationship with her?", "I think OP probably owes Joy an apology for the extremely harsh way he responded. I do think though at 25 she's old enough to know she isn't entitled to someone else's sponsorship if she's never even had any sort of relationship with them", "If my dad had told me my aunt (who is cool, I like her but we have no relationship to speak of) was going to cover my living expenses for an indeterminate period of time, my response would have been \"why the hell would she do that?\". As an adult, I'm not comfortable with my parents giving me money.  I'd be weirded out if one of my aunts or uncles was  put forth as a benefactor out of the blue for something that far from necessity.", "Good points!", "This.  Joy, Tony, parents...  all A-Hs.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Op, I am a 48 year old man who has always dreamed of living in paris and pursuing my dreams.  I want to try every ham and cheese sandwich in paris.  Your brother promised that you would do this, so if you do not, you are TA.\n\nAlso, you have to pay for my wife and daughter. I already told them that you would.", "As long as it's in Paris."]}
