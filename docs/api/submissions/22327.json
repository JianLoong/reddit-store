{"id": 22327, "submission_id": "150j3sz", "title": "AITA for not paying for my niece to live in Paris?", "selftext": "I (38M) have a brother \"Tony\" (40M) who I despise. We never got along growing up. In fact, before yesterday, I haven't seen him in 3 years. My salary is \\~$180k and my husband makes more than me. We also have fruitful investments that generate quite a bit of passive income. My husband (42M) had full custody of his daughter \"Harmony\" from a previous relationship and she is an angel. We bonded and she really felt like she was my daughter as well. She is now 22, graduated from college Magna Cum Laude, and wants to work in fashion. She LOVES haute couture and wants to work in Paris. The problem? Paris is expensive and a lot of the positions that would consider her don't pay well, especially with how expensive Paris is. My husband and I decided to surprise her and sponsor her living expenses and additional allowance, so she doesn't have to worry about income and can focus on her dream. She was ecstatic and posted on social media about it.Well, Tony's daughter \"Joy\" (25F) saw the post and told him. She has also been wanting to work in Paris for years. I found this out because my parents invited my husband and I to dinner, and when we arrived, Tony was there too. The topic of us sending Harmony to Paris conveniently came up. They suggested that we sponsor Joy to go to Paris too because Harmony and Joy were basically cousins and could bond over a shared experience. I calmly said \"No, we aren't responsible for financing Joy. Tony can pay for Joy if he wants her to go to Paris.\" He aggressively responded that he doesn't make enough money for that and we are just showboating our money. I said that it is not our responsibility to send Joy to Paris simply because Harmony was going. They are not sisters and don't even have a relationship with each other. So if Tony couldn't afford it, tough s\\*\\*t.This led to a long drawn out argument and then it came out that Tony had already told Joy a month ago that we promised to pay. He also said that \"I would be a sh\\*tty uncle if I didn't pay for my niece but would pay for someone who isn't even my biological daughter\". Now, this is where I might be the AH because my blood boiled. I said that Joy was NOT my niece because he is NOT any brother of mine. My husband and I left and, shortly after, Joy called me begging to pay to let her go. I was still enraged and yelled \"I don't understand how you and your father think you can use me as an ATM when neither of you have ever been family to me. Pay for yourself!\" and I hung up. After a few more hours, I have cooled down and started seeing the family backlash against me on social media. A lot of people say that I am punishing Joy because I hate Tony. I'm still not going to pay for her, but Joy technically is innocent in all of this, I guess. And a lot of my resentment is towards Tony, not her. My parents have called and said they were disappointed in how I think of family, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1689445350, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150j3sz/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_niece_to_live_in_paris/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is TA for telling Joy that you promised to pay. And an AH in general for expecting you to finance this without even discussing it first.

I hadn't really focused on my parents' involvement in all of this. This isn't the first time they have tried to bring Tony and I closer. I think they just thought that he and I could resolve some tension through the bonding of Joy and Harmony. I'm used to their tactics by now.\n\nSecond, Joy and I do not have a relationship. As a child, she was kept away from me by my brother and his now ex-wife. As an adult, she hasn't made any effort to reach out to me until now.\n\nSo, I think my rage response to Joy came out because I simply saw her as an extension of my brother. Tony is pretty homophobic and generally bullied me for being gay growing up and stayed away from me once he moved out of the house. He and I don't have a relationship and I have no desire to build one. Now I probably should've been more measured in my response to Joy, as she probably didnt know that Tony lied to her. I can see apologizing to her for yelling and saying she is not family to me, but that's all I can see...", "NTA.  Your brother tried to use \"family\" as his reason to pressure you into paying. \n\nUnless Joy pressured you, she probably thought you were going to do it.  She probably deserves an apology.", "NTA to Tony, but you Joy deserves an apology.", "NTA\n\nAll of these family members who are so enraged can pay for your niece to go to Paris. Tony should start a gofundme.

They didn't tell you what was in store when they invited you to dinner, right? Just suddenly there it is: gimme gimme.\n\nOf course, you have a wonderful relationship with your daughter and not much of one with your niece, so the thinking that it's only symmetrical that you should pay for Joy is stupid. But your brother isn't \"thinking.\" He wants money from you because he wants money fro0m you.\n\nThat's all it is: a mooch.\n\nAnd you should tell the relatives calling up to attack that they can pay for Joy if they feel that way about it.", "NTA!

Tony should never have promised his daughter money that was not his to give away.\n\nOP, if I were you, I would apologize for the tone but not the meaning. Both Tony and Joy are using you as an ATM, and you rightfully won't stand for that. Also, it drives me NUTS that Tony called Harmony not your daughter. You clearly are a beloved father figure to her.

Her father sucks for acting like you do.\n\nHowever, with as ridiculous as her father is behaving it\u2019s quite possible she really was promised you\u2019d pay and has no idea the truth about your dynamic.
