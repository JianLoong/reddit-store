{"id": 22327, "submission_id": "150j3sz", "title": "AITA for not paying for my niece to live in Paris?", "selftext": "I (38M) have a brother \"Tony\" (40M) who I despise. We never got along growing up. In fact, before yesterday, I haven't seen him in 3 years. My salary is \\~$180k and my husband makes more than me. We also have fruitful investments that generate quite a bit of passive income. My husband (42M) had full custody of his daughter \"Harmony\" from a previous relationship and she is an angel. We bonded and she really felt like she was my daughter as well. She is now 22, graduated from college Magna Cum Laude, and wants to work in fashion. She LOVES haute couture and wants to work in Paris. The problem? Paris is expensive and a lot of the positions that would consider her don't pay well, especially with how expensive Paris is. My husband and I decided to surprise her and sponsor her living expenses and additional allowance, so she doesn't have to worry about income and can focus on her dream. She was ecstatic and posted on social media about it.Well, Tony's daughter \"Joy\" (25F) saw the post and told him. She has also been wanting to work in Paris for years. I found this out because my parents invited my husband and I to dinner, and when we arrived, Tony was there too. The topic of us sending Harmony to Paris conveniently came up. They suggested that we sponsor Joy to go to Paris too because Harmony and Joy were basically cousins and could bond over a shared experience. I calmly said \"No, we aren't responsible for financing Joy. Tony can pay for Joy if he wants her to go to Paris.\" He aggressively responded that he doesn't make enough money for that and we are just showboating our money. I said that it is not our responsibility to send Joy to Paris simply because Harmony was going. They are not sisters and don't even have a relationship with each other. So if Tony couldn't afford it, tough s\\*\\*t.This led to a long drawn out argument and then it came out that Tony had already told Joy a month ago that we promised to pay. He also said that \"I would be a sh\\*tty uncle if I didn't pay for my niece but would pay for someone who isn't even my biological daughter\". Now, this is where I might be the AH because my blood boiled. I said that Joy was NOT my niece because he is NOT any brother of mine. My husband and I left and, shortly after, Joy called me begging to pay to let her go. I was still enraged and yelled \"I don't understand how you and your father think you can use me as an ATM when neither of you have ever been family to me. Pay for yourself!\" and I hung up. After a few more hours, I have cooled down and started seeing the family backlash against me on social media. A lot of people say that I am punishing Joy because I hate Tony. I'm still not going to pay for her, but Joy technically is innocent in all of this, I guess. And a lot of my resentment is towards Tony, not her. My parents have called and said they were disappointed in how I think of family, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1689445350, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150j3sz/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_niece_to_live_in_paris/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hadn't really focused on my parents' involvement in all of this. This isn't the first time they have tried to bring Tony and I closer. I think they just thought that he and I could resolve some tension through the bonding of Joy and Harmony. I'm used to their tactics by now.\n\nSecond, Joy and I do not have a relationship. As a child, she was kept away from me by my brother and his now ex-wife. As an adult, she hasn't made any effort to reach out to me until now.\n\nSo, I think my rage response to Joy came out because I simply saw her as an extension of my brother. Tony is pretty homophobic and generally bullied me for being gay growing up and stayed away from me once he moved out of the house. He and I don't have a relationship and I have no desire to build one. Now I probably should've been more measured in my response to Joy, as she probably didnt know that Tony lied to her. I can see apologizing to her for yelling and saying she is not family to me, but that's all I can see...", "NTA.

They didn't tell you what was in store when they invited you to dinner, right? Just suddenly there it is: gimme gimme.\n\nOf course, you have a wonderful relationship with your daughter and not much of one with your niece, so the thinking that it's only symmetrical that you should pay for Joy is stupid. But your brother isn't \"thinking.\" He wants money from you because he wants money fro0m you.\n\nThat's all it is: a mooch.\n\nAnd you should tell the relatives calling up to attack that they can pay for Joy if they feel that way about it.", "NTA!

Tony should never have promised his daughter money that was not his to give away.\n\nOP, if I were you, I would apologize for the tone but not the meaning. Both Tony and Joy are using you as an ATM, and you rightfully won't stand for that. Also, it drives me NUTS that Tony called Harmony not your daughter. You clearly are a beloved father figure to her.

Her father sucks for acting like you do.\n\nHowever, with as ridiculous as her father is behaving it\u2019s quite possible she really was promised you\u2019d pay and has no idea the truth about your dynamic.

I believe you can be right and civil.\n\nTherefore you do suck a little too.", "NTA You walked into an ambush and walked away \"incensed\". Apologize to her for going off like that.

I have an aunt whose decently well off and while I have a good relationship with her I would never at any point in my life think about asking her for money", "NTA OP and I really don't see where you would owe your niece any type of apology either.  I mean, while as a minor, she had no choice in whether she could contact you or not but once she reached the age of 18, the choice was then hers.  So from the age of 18 to 25, she made no effort to get to know you and your husband but expect you both to fund her stay in Paris.  As for your parents and the rest of your family, you need to tell them this and that you have a father-daughter relationship with your stepdaughter as your husband had full custody of his daughter and as a father, you are providing for your daughter.  Whereas, you didn't and don't have any uncle/niece relationship with your niece and that don't have to do with what you feel towards your brother.

Your brother should never have lied to his daughter and said that you would pay for her to go to Paris.,  And it ridiculous for your brother to say that Harmony is not your daughter and that you should pay for your niece over her.

In mainstream USA culture it would be weird to expect you to pay for your niece to have something good that you're giving your own daughter. And your husband's daughter IS your daughter.

She does not get to cry wolf now when it suits her.", "Sounds like they think because you earn a certain amount of money you should automatically give it to them because they don't simply because you share a blood relationship. This is incredibly entitled.\n\nI'm sure Joy is upset, she sounds quite immature for 25 and her Dad got her hopes up. To be honest it sounds like she's projecting the pain of disappointment into anger and upset at you for being unfair, I don't think anyone would have told her she's been lied to. It may be worth sending her a message just to explain this \n\nI understand you feel bad you said she's not family but remember they said your daughter in all but blood is not your family either which is a disgusting thing to say. Not only that but they did think that you should pay for a practical stranger to stay in another country after your brother's homophobia. It boggles my mind at this level of entitlement.\n\nI'm not sure anything you say will get through to them other than going LC or NC until they drop it.

If precious innocent Joy should be mad and disappointed it should be in her lying father for getting her expectations up or maybe just playing to her grasping nature. Who expects someone she doesn't have a relation ship to pay? I mean *really*. Seriously.", "You don't have to finance someone elses child if his/her parents can't afford to fulfill her 'dream'.  Not everyone can get what they want in the world.  You're lucky enough to be able to give your stepdaughter what she has wanted and will move her up in the field she works in.  I'm extremely lucky that I'll be able to help my daughters out when they are ready to move on into whatever career they choose, life isn't always fair.  NTAH.", "Totally agree with this.  I mean, it is awfully presumptuous of Joy to ask/expect for OP to pay for her, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she acted poorly like her father.

I let my lifelong anger at your dad's homophobia and my rightful anger at your strange request for money spill over into an unnecessarily rude interaction with you despite barely knowing you. I understand that your father previously lied to you about the possibility of my husband and I paying for you to live in Paris. I'm sorry if you got your hopes up based on that lie. We will not be giving money to anyone other than our own daughter. I wish you well and sincerely hope you haven't taken on any of your dad's hateful opinions, especially if you have an interest in the fashion industry.\"\n\nShe might have no idea about any of it so emphasizing your brother's homophobia is one way to give her enough context to start to understand just how outrageous this whole thing is. \n\nAlternatively, you could try:\n\n\"Hi Joy!
