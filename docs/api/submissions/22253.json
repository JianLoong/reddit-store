At one point I yelled at her \u201cI\u2019m just fat ok!\u201d And she backed off lol. At about 20 weeks we had an anatomy scan and thought it was ok to tell everyone. She was mad that she we had lied, but we also reminded her that she was invading our privacy at the time and that\u2019s the extent it took to get her to butt out. \n\nI think your family had it out for you when you didn\u2019t go to all the family stuff beforehand. It didn\u2019t matter if you were pregnant or not, they would have found something to bitch about. Don\u2019t go to her next wedding either.", " It's unacceptable to the jinxing gods to announce that you're pregnant any other time except the day of your sister's wedding? YTA.

You might luck out for Thanksgiving you can she is too pregnant to travel.", ">my wife wore a lose fitting dress so unless you really looked you couldn\u2019t notice\n\nI'll bet you people were looking, though. I mean, I can't speak for most people who wear dresses, but when I go to a wedding, I want to wear one that's flattering and comfortable, and usually it means there's more of a fitted bodice (which I acknowledge is for my body type, that's more of an hourglass shape and might not be the case for others). If the loose fitting dress isn't your wife's usual style, combined with missing the dinner and the odd behavior, I'd bet people were talking more than you think. \n\nUsually every family has those perceptive people who just notice things about other people. Maybe they're walking differently (pregnancy gives you a slightly widened gait, even at 4 months), maybe they're smiling more, sweating more, drinking more--but every family has at least one person who notices. Where you get into trouble is if the perceptive person is also the gossip. \n\nAnyway, all that to say, you probably weren't flying under the radar as much as you thought. I am 100% empathetic to the idea of rituals surrounding miscarriage, however, I think in this instance there were other options to make people aware of the situation without having it announced at the wedding.

Everyone shows pregnancy weight differently. Your wife clearly shows pregnancy weight at four months quite obviously--as evidenced by the fact that even men were loudly remarking on it when she was wearing a loose outfit. So if it was not possible to hide at this point... I think you should have let everyone know ahead of the wedding ceremony. I understand your anxiety over this given the past miscarriages, but showing up and \"announcing it\" with your wife's baby bump at your sister's wedding wasn't a cool move either. \n\nEven if I was inclined to believe you had zero idea what you were doing there, you CHOSE to tell your drunk uncle that she was pregnant while you were eating McDonalds out in the car. What did you think would happen? Of course he was going to go blab it to everyone inside. You knew this would happen and you did it anyway. All you needed to say was, \"This is so embarrassing, but we both really hate seafood. Please don't say anything. We're sure the caterers are wonderful.\"\n\nSo I think your sister was terrible for making a huge announcement and embarrassing your wife, but I also agree with her that you were on some level trying to make her wedding day all about you.

Why can't a pregnant woman just exist. She didn't want a big announcement.  But the cat got out the bag. People need to grow up and stop pretending that being visibly pregnant without a big announcement is some kind of offensive behavior.", "Is there some kind of sin being committed to be pregnant at a wedding? They didn\u2019t steal the mic from the best man and climb on a table to do a gender reveal or anything.\n\nThey did nothing wrong.\n\nI would have made a scene at the brother in law\u2019s comment.", "Mature adults don\u2019t need to lie about being pregnant.", "teenagers like to think theyre grown lmfao", "Couldn\u2019t you and your wife have just\u2026not gone to her law school party? I don\u2019t understand. This is making me second-guess your entire story.", "You wanted your sister's graduation party to be put off by a few months because something happened in your life?  \n\n***MONTHS***???\n\nAnd you think she's the one that's an attention seeker?\n\n-----\n\nIt's obvious at this point that you're the attention seeker and wanted the drama.  You wanted to stir the pot.  You wanted the \"rainbow baby\" comments.\n\n-----\n\nIn case you decide to edit the comment because it shows your true character, I'm keeping a copy so people know what I replied to:\n\n> She\u2019s definitely an attention seeker when my wife had a miscarriage last year my sister held herself a party not a week later because she got into law school I said her wait a few months and she told me no she and her friends planned on going to America for the summer so this was her only time to celebrate with family", "Why should she have to wait to celebrate getting into law school because of your wife\u2019s miscarriage? It\u2019s very sad and unfortunate the pregnancy didn\u2019t make it to term but life keeps on moving and your sister is allowed to celebrate her achievements.", "It's not attention-seeking to not want to put off celebrating a major life event because your brother's wife had a miscarriage, especially if it's the only time she could do it. I understand this was a tragic event in your life, but it's completely unreasonable to expect everyone else in your family to not celebrate any good news for months.", "It sounds like you don't even live close by though. Why would it be an issue to celebrate her achievement?", "Your sister has every right to celebrate her accomplishments, why should she hide if your wife had a miscarriage.\n\nIt's not like she announced a pregnancy.   \n\nYou have major main character syndrome and the more you comment the more entitled you sound.", "See this is where I\u2019m thinking you might have some issues of your own. Like it\u2019s NOT just your sister. Your brother husband also called you out. And some other family members. When everyone thinks you\u2019re an AH, I start to wonder if they have a point.", "Why does your sister have to revolve her life around your wife\u2019s miscarriages? Now I see why your brother\u2019s husband called you tacky. You\u2019re exactly the same as her, attention seekers who want it to be all about them and their problems.", "I dont see how that is wrong for her to do though. If she would expect you to come and be angry about that, then she would be TA. Not for being happy and not wanting to wait a few months to celebrate an achievement like that.", "Holy crap. Who asks for that?\n\nYou wanted that \n\nYTA YTA YTA", "Damn, OP, crazy how the entire world didn't stop on your account.\n\nYou didn't have to make a formal announcement but don't be thick, if your family knows you've been trying for years, and your wife shows up in a purposely shapeless dress and you refuse the seafood and likely drinks and also leave the area to eat in your car... Sure, you didn't *announce* the pregnancy, but if people were acting awkward and not inviting you for pics, they could clearly tell. Should have left your poor wife at home to rest instead of dragging her through all this. You didn't mean to be TA but you absolutely were in your family's eyes and this situation. \n\nYTA", "Why would she wait to hold a party thay has nothing to do with pregnancy or babies?", "They can't help it if they were not ready to announce the pregnancy before the wedding.  Timing of life events isn't always convenient.", "It was other people who made a big deal about everything. Expecting a pregnant woman who fears another miscarriage to make a big announcement prior to an event of a large group is just \u2026 mean. She was trying to keep a low profile.", "Omg no, it's not on par with wearing a white dress! Life goes on, people get pregnant, it's not always possible to announce it to everyone who will be attending a wedding before said wedding.", "This - this is a HUGE part of it, so no, they didn\u2019t need to announce anything. They wanted to keep it private.", "My wife and I went through something similar, although it was 4 years, an ectopic pregnancy and another miscarriage before finally having a safe one, and I can see why they would be super hesitant to make an announcement beforehand. It sounds like this family has a ton of issues (drunk uncles, spoiled sisters, weird BIL, etc) so I\u2019m not sure anytime would have been acceptable with this bunch. I do think it depends a lot on how much she\u2019s showing though.", "Not at someone else's event.  \n\nI'm so glad I'm definitely not in your family.  You'd get roasted alive here.  And you'd get an invoice to cover half the cost of whatever event you decided to discuss your big news at.", "So to confirm, you think it's attention seeking entitled behavior for someone to have a graduation party after they graduated lawschool if (possible not even yet invited) guest had a miscarriage weeks before?  \n\nBecause OP wanted that delayed for ***MONTHS***.  \n\nYou're on that side?", "OP has confirmed it.  \n\nI don't get why you're fighting this.  OP commented to me directly that yes he told the whole truth because he didn't want to lie.  \n\nHe told the uncle the whole thing.", "It isn't lying to not mention it.   It isn't lying to say you won't discuss it.  It isn't lying to say \"I don't want to talk about pregnancies or miscarriages or anything with children.  You know our history and I just want to have a fun night.  Don't bring this up again\".  \n\nIf you seriously think you have to lie in order to be firm, you need to learn healthy ways of being firm.", "Mature adults don't feel like a pregnancy is stealing their spotlight. This is the root of it", "I saw a response somewhere in the comments from the wife of one of the brothers. She said that they came and made a scene, talked nonstop about the pregnancy, and pretty much did a gender reveal at the wedding.", "Isn\u2019t it interesting how OP completely stopped commenting after he gave himself away as the self-centered one with this reply?", "I agree with you. I was on op\u2019s side until this thread. Now I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s not a reliable narrator.", "And imo there\u2019s nothing wrong with *wanting* a little attention from a big achievement like getting accepted into law school. It\u2019s a big deal! If the wife was feeling too much grief still and didn\u2019t want to go I totally understand, but to ask the sister to not have a party at all is weird.", "Oh no my brothers having a baby after 8 years! I\u2019m going to be an aunt! But shoot I\u2019m also getting married, instead of double the happiness I\u2019ll just be hateful and spiteful instead! Lmao great family you got there bud. Stay safe.", "Wow that's insanely dumb, your family sounds disgusting", "Wow, your family sounds like a bunch of shitheads. You sound SoOoOo EdGy.", "They didn\u2019t discuss it! Yeah they shouldn\u2019t have told the uncle but it\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault the uncle and his mom couldn\u2019t keep their mouths shut", "Ohh, okay, I didn't know that's what that comment meant. I was just looking for a mention of the uncle and didn't consider he would answer like that.", "No one\u2019s trying to be firm. That\u2019s just you.", "She also claims the OP\u2019s wife is homophobic.

Being polite isn't edgy.\n\n-----\n\nI've now been confirmed correct in the comments.  He did do this for attention.  He's a sexist homophobe as well.", "And now OP has said the sister is an \"attention seeker\" for not delaying her graduation party by several months because OP's wife had a miscarriage the weeks before.  \n\nMonths.   \n\nIt's obvious at this stage that OP is a shit stirrer and wanted the drama.", "I said OP needed to be firm.  I asked if the people not grasping that aren't capable of being firm if they don't understand how.", "Oh shit, I\u2019ll have to stay tuned and see if receipts are posted. \n\nIt\u2019s easy for someone to just claim to be a real person in a story like this (hell, it\u2019s possible it\u2019s all made up) lol but I\u2019m intrigued to see if it\u2019s real!!"]}
