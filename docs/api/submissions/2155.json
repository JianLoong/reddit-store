We\u2019ll call this woman Tina.\n\n\nTina is a 40 something year old woman who has been in the program for 8 years and is a cherished figure at that specific NA group. Tina and my sister have been talking a lot since she joined the new group, texting constantly, and she even gives my sister rides to the meetings a lot of the time when I can\u2019t. My sister really likes this woman, and was excited for me to meet her. I was excited too, she seemed like a great influence for my sister.\n\n\nAnyway I go to the meeting, it was fine, met a few people including Tina and everything was great. When it was time to leave, my car wouldn\u2019t start and Tina offered us a ride. I sat in the backseat to let me sister chat with her friend.\n\n\nAs we\u2019re driving, Tina asks if she\u2019d care if we stopped by her place so she could grab something and mentioned something about making a delivery. We waited in the car while she went into her house and I asked my sister what she means by delivery and my sister is just really quiet and tries to shrug me off but I pushed until she told me that Tina gets a prescription for adderal she doesn\u2019t take and sells it. I was absolutely speechless. I pushed my sister for more details, specifically how long she\u2019s known about this, and she told me she found out when Tina OFFERED IT TO HER one day. \n\n\nI about lost my shit. Who does that? What kind of sick predator tries to peddle drugs to NA members? I made my sister get out of the car and called an Uber as I proceeded to flip shit on this woman the entire time. In the car ride home, I messaged the leader of the home group and told him everything that happened and even got screen shots from my sister\u2019s phone with proof of her talking about drugs. I also posted on my personal Facebook about her, no names but people in those circles knew who it was about. \n\n\nThe leader thanked me for telling him and I know he ended up confronting Tina because my sister has been getting messages from her and others in the group tearing her apart for allowing me to break anonymity and also breaking it herself by telling me what Tina did, and that we are \u201cruining Tina\u2019s life and risking her sobriety\u201d (like she didn\u2019t do that all on her own.) My sister is mortified and so angry with me. But I think I did the right thing and refuse to apologize to this predator. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668288812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytj0al/aita_for_breaking_anonymity_at_my_sisters_na/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It means you're not supposed to repeat what you hear in a meeting to anyone.\n\nYou didn't break her anonymity. If anything, since you let someone know, you actually helped make that meeting safer.", "NTA.\n\nI've never been in NA, but I'm pretty sure the one rule that allows the break of annonimity is when someones behaviour/actions is litterally risking the sobriety of others, especially with drugs!\n\nThis is NA, you're supposed to be abstaining from those things right? So why would someone be selling it to members! That's a total risk factor! Everything about what this \"Tina\" did is totally predatory and these people needed to know! If it was AA, and someone in the meeting tried to give booze to members after, they would be kicked out!\n\n\nSorry, this is just really making ME angry cuz I am an ex addict and I KNOW how hard it is when you are trying to abstain and get healthy. Having someone you trust also offer you the very drugs you are trying to get off is HUGE red flag to me! They are just a predatory person trying to hurt those who are vulnerable!", "NTA.

That\u2019s why dealing drugs in an NA group is generally frowned upon. That\u2019s also why anonymity is generally supported. You did the right thing in protecting not just your sister, but her whole NA group.\n\nTake a correlate environment: medical practice. HIPPA protects patient identity. Exceptions to the rule exist if you find out someone is being harmed by someone else. In fact, you are not just encouraged but mandated to break anonymity and report to CPS if a child is involved in such a scenario.", "NTA.

Thank you for confirming I have nothing to feel guilty about.", "Thank you", "You\u2019re probably right", "Yes but my sister is very vocal about and proud of her recovery and actively posts about it herself.
