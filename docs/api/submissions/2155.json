My sister really likes this woman, and was excited for me to meet her. I was excited too, she seemed like a great influence for my sister.\n\n\nAnyway I go to the meeting, it was fine, met a few people including Tina and everything was great.

We waited in the car while she went into her house and I asked my sister what she means by delivery and my sister is just really quiet and tries to shrug me off but I pushed until she told me that Tina gets a prescription for adderal she doesn\u2019t take and sells it. I was absolutely speechless. I pushed my sister for more details, specifically how long she\u2019s known about this, and she told me she found out when Tina OFFERED IT TO HER one day. \n\n\nI about lost my shit. Who does that? What kind of sick predator tries to peddle drugs to NA members? I made my sister get out of the car and called an Uber as I proceeded to flip shit on this woman the entire time. In the car ride home, I messaged the leader of the home group and told him everything that happened and even got screen shots from my sister\u2019s phone with proof of her talking about drugs. I also posted on my personal Facebook about her, no names but people in those circles knew who it was about. \n\n\nThe leader thanked me for telling him and I know he ended up confronting Tina because my sister has been getting messages from her and others in the group tearing her apart for allowing me to break anonymity and also breaking it herself by telling me what Tina did, and that we are \u201cruining Tina\u2019s life and risking her sobriety\u201d (like she didn\u2019t do that all on her own.)

That\u2019s why dealing drugs in an NA group is generally frowned upon. That\u2019s also why anonymity is generally supported. You did the right thing in protecting not just your sister, but her whole NA group.\n\nTake a correlate environment: medical practice. HIPPA protects patient identity. Exceptions to the rule exist if you find out someone is being harmed by someone else. In fact, you are not just encouraged but mandated to break anonymity and report to CPS if a child is involved in such a scenario.", "NTA.

Thank you for confirming I have nothing to feel guilty about.", "Thank you", "You\u2019re probably right", "Yes but my sister is very vocal about and proud of her recovery and actively posts about it herself.

If so, you may regret leaving it up.", "I said Tina offered her adderal. Never said she took it.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't \"breaking anonymity\". That would be outting her addiction to the community. \n\nThis right here is what every junkie struggles with. Personal accountability for endangering and harming everyone around them.\n\nTina was abusing the system to make money off addicts riding the edge, she wasn't there to get help nor was her privacy violated. They're just making excuses for their drug dealer.", "I don't think you broke anonymity, however, I would recommend taking the post off your face book page, especially if you live in a small area where people can figure out who Tina is.", "NTA, this actually doesn't break the rules. If someone is in the group trying to get other members of the group to use again, they are breaking a fundamental rule.\n\nYour sister was in a poisonous group and you should not apologize.

Tina is not cool and good thing you reported her. besides dealing drugs to people in NA is not the anonymity they were trying to protect.", "NTA, wait the sponsor who is supposed to help people with addiction is supplying drugs.  I think this trumps anonymity.  She gave that up when she violated the foundational trust of the group.", "Facebook was wrong.

The way that addiction works it\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking and preying on vulnerable people is vile. \n\nGive your sister some time but always be there to hold space with her. She\u2019s probably blaming herself a lot. Her anger may be misguided. It is always hard when we find out those we cherish and look up to are not what they seem.

On what planet is posting on social media acceptable behavior by OP?", "OP's sister needs to learn to protect her own sobriety and for the moment it sounds like she's managing. OP is *not* doing her the favor she thinks she is. \n\nPlus, OP outed not only this woman but her sister. I know she says her sister is very open about her membership but she should probably reconsider that. It's not good if people start seeing her as the face of NA. If OP's sister has a slip, which is super common, people will judge the whole program by her behavior. Anonymity has a multitude of facets.
