NA is an anonymous fellowship, you can\u2019t be posting about a particular meeting and it\u2019s members online, don\u2019t care how angry you are. However anonymity doesn\u2019t apply when needing to report a member\u2019s illegal activities to the relevant authorities. I think blasting anyone on facebook is a shitty thing to do tbh. As for your sister, I would advise she try a different meeting if she can or go to AA whilst everything dies down. There\u2019s no reason for her recovery to suffer because of what has happened.

At meetings, they usually say \u201cno drugs or paraphernalia allowed at this meeting for the protection of the members\u201d and meetings request that drugs are left outside/in your car. I don\u2019t know that she was actually breaking any meeting rules\u2026. But also, you\u2019re not a member. If you went to an open meeting where non addicts are allowed, you didn\u2019t break any anonymity, it was broken when you walked in and the members consented to that by having and attending an open meeting. If it was a closed meeting (for addicts only) you should\u2019ve been asked to leave. \n\nI can understand the humiliation your sister feels, and the defensiveness on the part of the NA members. After all, NA is a place for all addicts to recover, regardless of where they are in the process. Sobriety and good life choices are not a condition of membership, and generally the idea is that by continuing to come to meetings, people will eventually recover, which probably won\u2019t happen if they go to prison for dealing. \n\nBut\u2026 you didn\u2019t report them to the authorities. If I were you, I would respond to the message that you\u2019re not an NA member, and haven\u2019t spoken to anyone outside the group giving Tina\u2019s name and personal information, plus this happened outside of a meeting. If I go to a meeting, meet someone there, and go get dinner with them afterwards, I couldn\u2019t refuse to give the McDonald\u2019s worker their name by citing anonymity.

Anonymity refers to what you hear in meetings (Who you see here, what you hear here, let it stay here) but also identifying any member to another.

It\u2019s easy to have messed up thinking when you are being influenced by addicts hiding their relapse. Addiction is manipulative af.", "You broke no anonymity per 12 step guidelines. \n\nAnd this Tina lady was a total predator. There are more than you realize and it's really unfortunate. You absolutely did the right thing.", "SHE OFFERED YOUR SISTER DRUGS? And your sister wanted Tina as a sponsor????? \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your sister needs to find a new meeting. These people are not helping her stay sober. They\u2019re gaslighting the shit out of her about what being sober means. This is insane.", "NO! As much as the people giving your sister a hard time want to pretend it is, This isn't fight club. \n\nYou didn't break anonymity because A. You told people in the group and they already knew her. B. Anonymity is to protect people for the things they say during NA about their past. If this was something she had done in her past and you told all of facebook then that would be breaking anonymity but you told people in the group about what she was doing behind their backs in the current and now that could risk other peoples sobriety and C. You did not use her real name on facebook so she still has anonymity and even if you had used her name you aren't sharing info you got from NA you got info about someone in NA offering to sell your recovering sister drugs. Anonymity is NOT about protecting current drug use or selling to people with drug problems and risking their sobriety.", "NTA\nAnonymity is about not repeating what people share in meetings, or revealing to others that someone attends them. It needs to be a space that is safe *from the outside* so people can share what they need to without worrying it will impact their \"real\" lives. (The boss shouldn't know you go to meetings, unless you're comfortable telling them, least they start treating you differently.)\n\nThis wasn't information shared in a meeting, nor did you (for instance) introduce her as someone from an NA meeting to a person that didn't know.\n\nThis was behavior absolutely contrary to being in the program, and the consequences to \"Tina\" and your sister are in accordance. The folks mad at you probably don't actually understand what happened, or what anonymity is about.", "Well she only outed Tina right, not anyone else? Honestly, why not blast her on social media so she can't join other NA groups and do the same thing?", "Anonymity means not telling others that so-and-so goes to NA. If your public post had named her you\u2019d have done that. But all you did was make a predatory behaviour someone they already knew was doing.", "\"recovering addicts\" is an incredibly hateful and stigmatizing way to talk about people going to mutual aid meetings related to their drug use.", "\"allowed\"? It's none of her business and no one gets to allow it or not allow it. Prescription drugs from a pharmacy can save the life of someone who would otherwise buy fake ones. NA meetings are meant to be by and for people who use drugs and OP barging in with self-righteous nonsense was completely inappropriate and out of line. Drug users will use drugs. NA meetings will necessarily involve people meeting people they'll use with or get safer drugs from. It's the nature of the meeting.

I know there used to be, but they came down on them hard.  Also, pharmacists won't fill a lot of those rx's and definitely won't for repeat refills.\n\nI have a friend in FL who is a chronic pain patient who was forced to go to a methadone clinic because their doctor won't rx their medication anymore and pharmacies refuse to fill them anyway.  \n\nThey over-corrected when they reacted to the opioid epidemic to the detriment of legitimate pain patients.", "Right?

Drug dealers like Tina are why myself and others have to wait 3 fucking days to get our medication and if we run out that's too bad. \n\nThe fact that everyone in this group is mad at you along with your sister tells me they aren't actually going to NA to get better. They're doing it to appease someone/family, or getting a good deal on drugs. You need to report the crime immediately because the guilty by association thing is starting to get more popular.", "NTA you were in the right to report this woman to the groups administration.

People need to know what a shit person Tina is.", "Reminds me of a scene from Breaking Bad where the dealers were targeting NA meetings for a new client base.", ">no one gets to allow it or not allow it.\n\nPretty sure the cops would disagree with that. And the OP didn't barge in, she was an invited guest, she went there to help her sister quit using drugs. Supporting Tina would be like supporting someone who brings a keg to an AA meeting.

But that social media issue\u2026 instant asshole behavior because it hurts everyone. Their sister is going to look like she isn\u2019t on the sober road anymore.
