NA is an anonymous fellowship, you can\u2019t be posting about a particular meeting and it\u2019s members online, don\u2019t care how angry you are. However anonymity doesn\u2019t apply when needing to report a member\u2019s illegal activities to the relevant authorities. I think blasting anyone on facebook is a shitty thing to do tbh.

At meetings, they usually say \u201cno drugs or paraphernalia allowed at this meeting for the protection of the members\u201d and meetings request that drugs are left outside/in your car. I don\u2019t know that she was actually breaking any meeting rules\u2026. But also, you\u2019re not a member. If you went to an open meeting where non addicts are allowed, you didn\u2019t break any anonymity, it was broken when you walked in and the members consented to that by having and attending an open meeting. If it was a closed meeting (for addicts only) you should\u2019ve been asked to leave. \n\nI can understand the humiliation your sister feels, and the defensiveness on the part of the NA members. After all, NA is a place for all addicts to recover, regardless of where they are in the process. Sobriety and good life choices are not a condition of membership, and generally the idea is that by continuing to come to meetings, people will eventually recover, which probably won\u2019t happen if they go to prison for dealing. \n\nBut\u2026 you didn\u2019t report them to the authorities. If I were you, I would respond to the message that you\u2019re not an NA member, and haven\u2019t spoken to anyone outside the group giving Tina\u2019s name and personal information, plus this happened outside of a meeting. If I go to a meeting, meet someone there, and go get dinner with them afterwards, I couldn\u2019t refuse to give the McDonald\u2019s worker their name by citing anonymity.

Anonymity refers to what you hear in meetings (Who you see here, what you hear here, let it stay here) but also identifying any member to another.

She should have been your #1 priority and she will now be outcast as a narc, so soft YTA", "It\u2019s not uncommon for dealers to prey on people in recovery.", "NTA - you are totally right. I been in it, morphin plus IV, for seven years - been out of it for 25 \\^\\^ For me the people who sell and do not use are the worst. I'd rather have no car than have one from selling poison. She is the worst. She used NA to find new clients. Your sis will realize - when she's out of it. This woman was grooming her. OMG I'm sure they all knew. You didn't break nothing, as she did on her private time while you were in her car...", "> she\u2019s a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d. Tina was just a dealer using the group\n\nLike Jesse Pinkman lol", "Hardly surprising to find predatory behaviour in cults like AA and NA\n\nNTA btw", "I have been a nurse. You're not allowed to discuss patients outside work. Nothing you say can imply who your patient is. That is set in stone, well law, but anyway. If I saw a patient who is not supposed to eat because of a procedure, stuffing their face in the cafeteria, I was obliged to tell the surgeon so we knew for safety's sake. If I noticed fresh self harm scars, I made a note to tell their psych doctor for their safety and wellbeing to ensure they received good care but I couldn't gossip about them. Same with unethical staff. If I ever had suspected a doc was sleeping with a vulnerable patient or if the prescription didn't add up, I would have been obliged to report it or for others to report me. It's very similar with anon groups. She was dangerous to the health and wellbeing of recovering addicts. She needed to be reported.", "This 1000%.  I really hate to say it, but the social media post makes the whole thing YTA.  If it wasn't for that it would be N T A completely.", "Using drugs bc you're struggling to stay sober and selling drugs or offering drugs to recovering addicts  are two extremely different things", "Op I have 16 years clean and sober you absolutely did the right thing. Tina is absolutely a predator and most likely uses meetings to get her customers. I\u2019ve seen this exact scenario play out numerous times at meetings.  Dealers will go to meetings to get people that are more vulnerable and newer in recovery and try to flip them into customers.  It\u2019s disgusting and sick and honestly you should\u2019ve called the cops on her. The anonymous part is you don\u2019t reveal what\u2019s said in meetings and you aren\u2019t supposed to reveal how you know people from the program in real world scenarios ie social settings or at their jobs etc. Tina loses that privilege because she\u2019s committing crimes. You absolutely did the right thing and anyone that has an issue with it is neither a customer of hers or isn\u2019t seeing the bigger picture.", "Recovering addict/alcoholic here, nothing OP did was breaking anonymity at all.  If OP went out and told people who didn\u2019t know she was in NA that they saw her in an NA meeting then they would be breaking anonymity but clearly everyone already knows who she is and her name wasn\u2019t used when referring to her outside of NA.  I\u2019m shocked anyone inside an NA meeting thought what she was doing was ok and telling people from inside the meeting , who already know her, anything is irrelevant because, as I said, they already know her from NA. Also how is telling her home group member she is literally breaking the law only risks that crazy woman\u2019s sobriety if she chooses to use over her own actions.", "You don\u2019t, because for all you know, Tina was never a (recovering) addict, she\u2019s just using that as a ruse to sell drugs.", "I have a few friends who went to very expensive,  highly respected rehabs. The staff were bringing in all sorts of different drug and selling them marked up from street level value. People actually OD'ed in these places because of it.", "Same for pain management. 8yrs on same meds, at same dose with no issues, but because there are people who sell their meds, I randomly get to pee in a cup and insurance pay about half of the testing costs.", "Eh, kid of an addict. The way my mom described rehab was \"just learning new ways to get high without getting caught\" and \"all it ever did was make it easier to use\". Maybe we shouldn't be offering drugs to vulnerable women trying to get better. They could have kids at home counting on them to get better. \n \nIt could cost their kids entire childhood with a parent like it did mine. It sounds to me like he didn't name drop and it sends a warning to other potential victims. That's besides the fact that Tina took them both on a 'delivery' and it was treated VERY casually by OPs sister. Stop protecting predators.\n\nOn top of that, people need to stop fucking abusing adderrall. There is a huge shortage that has left me personally without medication for nearly 3 months now and kids with ADHD NEED their medication. \n\n Meanwhile this chick is getting them to sell to customers who are weak and in a low while in recovery. She knows what she's doing and you know what? She deserves to be called out. I personally hope it gets her medication revoked so that some kid on the area can have the medication *they actually need instead*.  There is a difference between being held accountable and being doxxed.

Selling drugs to drug addicts is awful, the woman is predatory", "People like her are the reason people who need medication can join longer get it.", "Sorry but we need to disband the notion that relapse is a part of recovery. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a part of relapse. One relapse and you\u2019re dead. That\u2019s not recovery. It\u2019s a harmful idea that lets addicts feel ok about not staying clean or sober. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA\nHaving spent the last 10+ years in anon programs, you absolutely positively could have saved someone\u2019s life. As far as social media goes, I suggest removing the post IMHO.", "Nah, they can do it with the amount from a finger prick. I've had them do that when I absolutely couldn't produce pee. Still annoying that I have to do this, but easier than producing pee when I'm npo for a procedure and they expect me to produce pee.", "And why do they always do urine samples when you've been told to fast? Like sorry for not drinking a gallon of water at 7 in the morning?", "Ugh yeah. I was in the hospital and they wanted my urine sample in the morning. They said it had to be morning pee. But I needed to pee really early when I woke up and I forgot about the sample. They basically tore the door open but I was finished. Then I had to do it again the next day.", "I wouldn't even use the past tense for that aspect \ud83d\ude2d Beyond addiction, thousands (millions?) never abused a prescription. After a couple months, their bodies just become dependent on the medication. Then there are 2 choices - excruciating withdrawal with little/no support, or continued use (typically via the street and/or cheaper alternatives). The stigmas have held strong throughout the years.", "I haven\u2019t had to do any urinalysis. I\u2019m not sure what determines that, because I know others in my state have had to. But I\u2019ve gone through two different clinics now, and I\u2019m even open with them about my illegal cannabis use.\n\nI just have a video appointment with a psychiatrist every 3 months, where she prescribes 1 month of meds that I just pick up from the pharmacy. Then I call her office and she sends over a prescription every month in between.\n\nAfter meeting with the psychiatrist a few times I had to take an assessment to get an official diagnosis, but I was even able to do that online. And if you are already diagnosed you can probably skip that part.", "Wow, thank you that's good info to know.  Seems like I'm in a very similar situation as you re: cannabis use (although I legally obtain edibles, the plant material itself is still illegal here in any quantity).  I'm going to look in to this so I appreciate the response.", "Funny, that\u2019s exactly my situation. Edibles were just legalized over the summer. \n\nGood luck!"]}
