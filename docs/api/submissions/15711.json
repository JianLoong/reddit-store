{"id": 15711, "submission_id": "12zdqjf", "title": "AITA for not taking in my neighbours delivery for her baby?", "selftext": "My neighbour (let\u2019s call her Mae) who lives across the road has a baby who is quite poorly. From what I understand she is tube fed and has a lot of medical appointments.\n\nOn Monday my boyfriend, Sam, had to leave in a bit of a rush after hearing his grandad had been taken to the hospital in the middle of the night. Sam\u2019s Grandad is fine and is coming home today. As Sam left in a rush, I decided to work at home so our dogs wouldn\u2019t be alone. Sam works from home usually.\n\nJust before lunch, there was a knock on the door. It was a delivery for Mae\u2019s baby. I asked the delivery why he hadn\u2019t gone to Mae\u2019s to deliver it. He told me that Mae had our address down as her alternative place to deliver to if she was not there. He had knocked on the door but Mae wasn\u2019t in, and that he had 30 boxes in the delivery for her. I told him that I wasn\u2019t taking 30 boxes in and that she would just have to rearranged. The driver told me that if I refused it would probably mean that Mae wouldn\u2019t get her delivery for another week as they are generally only in the area once a week. I told him that I couldn\u2019t take 30 boxes in as that would block up my hallway, and it was Mae\u2019s problem.\n\nWhen Sam came home from the hospital, he wasn\u2019t happy. Apparently Mae had called him in tears about the delivery. She hadn\u2019t been at home as the baby had gone for a scan under sedation and they were gone all day, her partner was at work as he had a meeting he couldn\u2019t get out of. Mae was upset as they were running low on supplies and she didn\u2019t think they had enough to last another week and wanted to know why he had refused the delivery after saying that he would take it in. Sam apologised to her, saying he thought I would take it in as he had to go to his grandad. Sam wanted to know why I had refused the delivery. I told him that I didn\u2019t want 30 boxes filling my hallway and that Mae should have rearranged the appointment so she was in for the delivery. Sam snapped at me saying that she had taken the appointment last minute as it was a cancellation otherwise she would have been waiting over a year for it because that\u2019s how long the waiting list is for that scan. Sam said that Mae doesn\u2019t ask her neighbours either side of her as they are elderly and one is a fall risk. Sam said I was selfish for not wanting to take the boxes in. I told him that he should have told me that he had arranged this. He admitted that he had just forgotten in the moment because he was concerned about his grandad. The delivery was for the baby\u2019s feeding supplies so was things like ready made formula, supplies for the feeding pump, etc.\n\nSam knows that I don\u2019t take anything in for our neighbours as I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019ll always do it. I\u2019ve been telling him to stop taking things in, just because he works from home doesn\u2019t mean he should turn our hallway into the post office.\n\nAITA for refusing to accept a delivery?\n\nEdit 1: Sam's just told me that Mae's messaged him. She's managed to get the delivery rearranged, and it is now coming tomorrow. He's asked if we need to take the boxes in, and she's said no as she doesn't trust that I'll refuse again and has arranged for someone to be in her house while she takes the baby to an appointment.\n\nEdit 2: I DO NOT know Mae. Everything I know about Mae, Sam has told me. He and Mae are friends. We've had issues in the past with taking in parcels for our neighbours. I've been yelled at before by one because I didn't take his parcel in - I was in a virtual meeting at the time. This is why I don't want us taking in parcels and why I have told Sam to stop. We only have a small hall way. It's not very wide, its not very long either. 30 boxes would have filled it up. Not to mention the fact I would likely be libel if anything happened to medical supplies. With there being ready made formula in the boxes, if one had been leaking and our dog who has a very sensitive stomach had eaten it, he could have been very sick and we'd have an expensive vet bill.", "created_utc": 1682506211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zdqjf/aita_for_not_taking_in_my_neighbours_delivery_for/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You knew it was stuff for a  medically fragile baby. And you knew that those boxes would've only been in your hallway for a handful of hours.\n\nHow did a sweetheart like Sam end up with someone like you?\n\nYTA", "OK, he should have told you, and for that he is a bit of an ass, but if you knew this was for a sick baby across the street, and not the home-brew system set-up for the next block frathouse, then, honestly, YTA. It would have blocked your place for a few hours, and it would have helped an already overwhelmed mother immensely. \n\nAnd yes, sometimes a doctor's appointment can be that hard to get. It's not just about rescheduling.", "YTA While you weren't under any obligation to take the packages, a kind person would have done it. How long would they have been \"filling\" your hallway? A few hours? Neighbours are supposed to look out for each other.", "YTA\n\nLike are you seriously asking. For heaven's sake how much does it take to a be a decent human. And you definitely knew what the delivery was about. 30 boxes blocking, not my problem, she could have rearranged you threw ever lame excuse for not helping. \n\nGod forbid if you ever need help. This is why the world has gone crazy apparently the slightest of help can be such discomfort. I am really glad to live in a community where the neighbors are first ones standing for little problems to big issues.", "I realise 30 boxes is a lot, but c'mon....its not like its a permanent fixture in your hall, and given the fragile situation with the baby.....god I cannot believe people like you exist.\n\nYTA", "YTA - that poor overwhelmed mother trying to take care of her baby \ud83e\udd7a. And to have a neighbor so selfish that they can\u2019t be bothered to clutter up a hallway for a day to make sure a baby is fed????? Oh how awful", "Yes, I think YTA. You already knew your neighbors were in crisis, so why not be kind and help them out? If you were in a similar situation, wouldn't you hope your neighbors would do the same?", "Sorry but YTA\n\nYou know what position Mae is in and whether or not deliveries annoy you at that point you take a view and help.\n\nWhether or not Sam made an agreement and whether or not he remembered to tell you (while really stressed and in a rush) doesn't change that most people would consider the health of an ill child more important than a clear hallway.", "YTA. It didn\u2019t matter if \u201cno is a complete sentence\u201d. Or \u201cit\u2019s your house you can do what you want\u201d. Those things are both true, but it doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t TA.", "Yep, you\u2019re pretty awful. Oh no I would have been inconvenienced for an afternoon, woe is me. YTA", "While people are having one medical emergency after another, you seem concerned w making sure you\u2019re not helping too much. 30 boxes is a lot to be fair. But it seems like you and your partner are on different pages. And he desperately screwed up on communication on this one. Reading this story, it kinda seems like you could\u2019ve called around a bit when the driver got there. This is a situation where people are in need. It\u2019s not easy to determine if you can or are willing to help. \n\nIf it\u2019s was your baby, what would you do? Would you want help? Are you sure you wouldn\u2019t need it? \n\nTry to be nice, it\u2019s s shitstorm out there. Please try not to be the AH. You\u2019re not being decidedly nta.\n\nIf you live in a tiny apartment, I struggle to call you an asshole. If your hallway would\u2019ve been walkable, YTA", "YTA - You know her situation. Park it in the living room, it will be gone within 24 hrs max.", "You seriously need to ask?\nClearly YTA!  X1000\nWhat a vile excuse for a human being.\nYou couldn't be inconvenienced for a while until Mae came home and would rather jeopardize an infant you KNOW to be sick??? \n\nThe delivery driver TOLD YOU Mae would have to wait a full week if you turned him away and you did so anyway.  \n\nI can't believe people like you exist! \nMakes me sick \ud83e\udd22\n\nIdk how you are not even ashamed to post this.", "I hate to say it, but yes. I was firmly on your side in the beginning. I was thinking that this woman had just put down your address as a backup without asking either of you first. But that\u2019s not the case here. That\u2019s not what happened. This lady had a discussion with your boyfriend and asked if he would be kind enough to take her delivery because she has a child with a medical condition and found herself in a bind. Your boyfriend said yes but due to extenuating circumstances with a family member, he couldn\u2019t be there. You were. It sounds like this is something he does often for neighbors and it sounds like you already know that. Since you knew he does this a lot, you probably should have known he might have agreed to take the delivery. Why not call and ask him before saying no? Or just take them this time and then talk to him about it later - again, only because you know this is something he does.\n\nDon\u2019t punish other people because you\u2019re upset with your boyfriend. I\u2019m assuming this delivery was for medication or food for a baby. That\u2019s pretty messed up and callous that you turned it away since your boyfriend agreed to help and this child needs their medical supplies. The mother and baby are innocent in this it sounds like. Again, I would feel differently if she had just put your address down without asking first (in which case she would be the asshole) but she didn\u2019t. \n\nI think you need to have a discussion with him. If it were me, I would have accepted the packages this time. Then I would have had a talk with my boyfriend. Then I would have spoken to my neighbor and said while boyfriend agreed to take packages, it\u2019s not something I\u2019m okay with. I would KINDLY say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry but I didn\u2019t know my boyfriend agreed to take your packages. He didn\u2019t tell me. This is an issue he and I need to work out. In the meantime, I\u2019m really not comfortable with you using our address as a backup anymore. Going forward, i will not accept a future delivery. Nothing against you.\u201d \n\nTo play devil\u2019s advocate a bit though - if your boyfriend is home during the day and he personally is okay with taking in packages for neighbors, why does that bother you? He\u2019s the one holding them. Why should you care? Does he hold the packages for weeks on end? Is your home filled with tons of packages all the time? If yes, then I understand your frustration. If it\u2019s just for a few hours, I personally don\u2019t see why you should be upset that he wants to help others. If you are more upset that people are taking advantage of him, that\u2019s not entirely your call to make if he doesn\u2019t feel the same way. It\u2019s tough because I can see both your side and his on this issue. But it\u2019s still not your neighbor\u2019s fault. Sounds more like a boundary issue (both yours and his boundaries).", "YTA. Boundaries, don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm, blah blah blah. This would\u2019ve been an inconvenience, maybe even a big one. 30 boxes is a lot. Still - the deliveries are only made once a week? They\u2019re for a super sick baby? My dude. Come on.", "30 boxes is a lot - this is what's called \"a favor\", in fact 1 box is \"a favor\", 30 boxes is \"a gigantic favor\".\n\nFavors are very useful to exchange among neighbors, because they are typically reciprocated, often at times of urgent need -- like if you house burns down, and you need a place to stay for the next 1-2 days.   Or your parents come to visit, and you're out when they arrive and so a neighbor takes them in and offers them tea while they wait for your return.\n\nYou've decided not to do favors for your neighbors.  Your neighbors will take note.\n\nYTA.", "Given who it was for, I think it was a bit mean of you not to take it in, even though it was lots of stuff. I know you have to set boundaries, and sometimes neighbours take advantage, but in this case, there was a very difficult outcome for somebody who was doing the best they could, and this outcome could completely have been solved at no cost and minimal inconvenience to you. So I'm leaning towards YTA.", "Both you and Sam are TA.  Sam didn\u2019t tell you about the delivery but still got on you for not taking it.  You are because you know about the issues the baby is having and still refused the delivery.  Given the baby\u2019s condition it\u2019s possible that the supplies were not readily available and the driver told you they\u2019d have to wait.  Your inconvenience is not worth possibly harming the baby.  Do better.", "YTA and so incredibly heartless", "You sound like an AH. This is because you\u2019re afraid that doing something nice for someone once is a huge risk, because you\u2019ll be trapped into doing it forever. This comes through in your language in several places. I wonder why you believe that? \n\nIn any case, Sam screwed up by not telling you, obviously. He knows you, so had no reason to expect you\u2019d put yourself to any inconvenience just to feed a baby. So Sam\u2018s at fault. Let\u2019s see who else is. \n\nMae sounds like she had a hard situation, and did the best she could. She asked her neighbor to take a delivery for her. He agreed. Done. She\u2019s morally in the clear. \n\nSo now it\u2019s you. You knew that the supplies were to feed Mae\u2019s baby. You knew they\u2019d be cleared out quickly.  Basic humanity obviously dictates that you accept the packages. But do you break universal moral code for failing to do so, on the grounds that you\u2019re not a post office?\n\nYes, you do. Your failure at empathy 101 makes you an AH, and your assumption that \u201cI should never be impacted by bad things that happen to other people\u201d is, to put it simply, what\u2019s wrong with the world. \n\nYTA", "YTA.  \nOur world would be better if we helped each other. This was someone who legit needed your help.", "YTA. All your reasons for not wanting to take in the packages are selfish.", "YTA - Yes, it was a big delivery, but you were aware of their circumstances. You could have realised the stress it would cause for them not to have the supplies. Having the boxes in your hall for one day impacts you significantly less than not having baby supplies for a week impacts the parents of a sick infant. \n\nThere was a miscommunication between you and Sam, as he had agreed to take it in. Bit if in doubt, take the stuff in and tell your neighbour when they pick it up that you'd rather they don't give your address. Remember favours like this from neighbours are give and take, you do it for them and they'll do it for you.", "YTA. Now, I would have also been pretty upset if I thought someone used my address as a back up delivery without asking so in that sense I understand your refusal.\n\nThat being said, you knew they had a sick kid and it be a week until the packages could be redelivered? That's a time you take the packages and then have a conversation about asking first. You would have then learned they did ask.\n\n Clearly there was a miscommunication with your boyfriend. Because of both of you this poor family is even more stressed despite doing everything right . You both owe them a huge apology.", "Are you really asking?\nHoney, YTA. First of all, it was not 30 boxes of toys and candies. You are perfectly aware of your neighbour's situation and your lack of empathy is unbelievable.\nYes, 30 boxes would have blocked your hallway. For how long? A month? A year? Oh, just a couple of hours. Such a sacrifice. The sick baby is far less important.", "The baby needs what's in the boxes to stay alive I'm assuming, so yeah, YTA here. Acting as if the boxes were going to be in your home for such an long amount of time. Do you live and dine in your hallway? Mean spirited people are everywhere.", "YTA, it is just a short time with the boxes. Have you told your neighbours you will never accept deliveries for them? If accepting deliveries isn't often, why is it so much a big problem?\nSome day you will need help like this from others and see how it is in other end. That Child needed those supplies, it can be life changing to have them or not. I hope the kid will be Ok.\n\nEdit, Sam is TA", "YTA. Oh no you would have been mildly inconvenienced but greatly helped out your neighbor who you know has a sick baby and the delivery driver explained the consequence of you rejecting the delivery. What a giant asshole and cruel.", "YTA. It's for a sick baby for gods sake. You're *entitled* to be an asshole, but it still makes you an asshole.", "YTA. How do you live with yourself being so heartless? I'd understand if it was a jungle gym off Amazon, but those are life saving supplies for an unwell baby. You've literally prioritized you hallway over a human life. You're really lucky if this isn't a deal breaker for your partner. I hope have the life you deserve.", "YTA.  So you know the baby is sick.  You know the baby NEEDS the things to live.  You REFUSED to hold onto the stuff for a short time... not days weeks or months, but a short time.  you are 100% the asshole.", "Honestly, YTA. You know the family, you know the baby situation, you don't have to pay for the delivery and you know they haven't moved anywhere - probably at work or something so they will pick up their boxes most likely in few hours or by the end of the day. Did you use your hallway during the rest of the day that intensely? Or just the thought of it being disorganized made you refuse something so little and neighbourly to do?", "You knew full well the boxes contained absolute necessities for a seriously ill baby. *Obviously* YTA. I'm glad she managed to get what she needed, no thanks to you.", "How is one *this* reluctant to help a fellow human being who is struggling?\n\nYour \"logic\" in all this reaches beyond any actual logical conclusions to be made under these circumstances.\n\nYou've turned a simple miscommunication into a potentially life threatening situation, all because you couldn't be slightly inconvenienced for a short while.\n\nGoodness gracious YTA.\n\nYou know what I would have done? I would have accepted the boxes AND carried them across the street for her. Hope you never need a hand up, because you wouldn't deserve it.", "YTA. I understand it would\u2019ve be an inconvenience but it\u2019s not like they would\u2019ve been there for a week. Have some compassion.", "Wow you\u2019re cold. Yes 30 packages is a lot but what\u2019s the big deal? Unless you were expecting the queen for a visit? Even she would have loved your heart.\n\nI really don\u2019t understand what your problem is. I take in packages for my neighbours all the time. They do the same for me. I really really don\u2019t get it, unless you\u2019ve had a bad experience or something? Helping people out should not be not that hard. \n\nYes.. people can set boundaries. But honestly this one just sucks.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Don't need to ask.", "YTA x3billion\n\nJeepers Creepers, I take packages in if they're just on the neighbor's porch and a thunderstorm is coming in just because I don't want their stuff to get wet.  Yes, 30 boxes is a lot, but you knew the circumstances.  \n\nWhat you did was cruel.", "Wow. You knew Mae was dealing with a very sick baby and you couldn't do one thing which would make a small problem for you for only a matter of hours?\n\nYTA.", "YTA.", "YTA.  \n\nHopefully  Sam will find a more compassionate mate soon.", "Wow. YTA and I can't believe you're questioning if you are an AH because you clearly know you are: \n\n**|**Sam knows that I don\u2019t take anything in for our neighbours as I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019ll always do it. I've been telling him to stop taking things in,", "YTA. Yes, that\u2019s a lot of boxes but you would have them for a day or two. How can\u2019t you can understand why she forgot to check with you or give you the heads up?  She is massively overwhelmed and fearing for her child.", "[removed]", "YTA.  You knew these were necessary medical for a young child and you basically told everyone around you to go screw because you didn\u2019t want to be bothered.

You also have an a hole for a heart.", "This is a difficult one to judge. Of course you're not required to help a neighbor,  especially when the favour is sprung on you. It's not asshole behavior to say no in most cases. However,  it does come off as very cold and unsympathetic to refuse a favor when you know all the circumstances and consequences to refusing, especially since it only requires a tiny amount of inconvenience to you. That pushes you a bit into the asshole category. \nIt's your reasoning for refusing - because you don't want neighbors to ask for help - that makes you more asshole than not.  So, YTA", "YTA. Minor inconvenience vs. the life of a sick child. I don't see where there is even a choice in this circumstance. If there is such a thing as karma, you will someday feel the consequences of your actions. I hope that you are seriously thinking of how to make this up to all involved.", "YTA. I hope you never have an emergency.  It doesn't hurt to extend kindness once in a while especially when you knew the situation. Don't count on your neighbors being kind to you in the future.

You'd rather a baby die than inconvenience yourself?", "YTA\nYou refused to take some boxes which contained supplies for a sick baby because they would have inconvenienced you for a day max.

That makes sense. \n\nI think it\u2019s definitely a boundary issue between you two. It sounds like for him, his boundary is that he wants to help others and he might feel you are not respecting his feelings on that.

It\u2019s hard to know what to do in this case but I think your upset needs to be directed at him. Not your neighbors - unless of course you\u2019ve already told them not to deliver packages to your home before this. If you haven\u2019t, that might need to be something you consider (after discussing it with him). Either way, I don\u2019t envy the spot you\u2019re both in.
