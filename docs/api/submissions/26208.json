However, my next-door neighbors have three young kids, all under the age of 7. Lately, these kids have been playing in their backyard for hours on end, and they can get pretty loud. They're homeschooled, so it's not like this will necessarily end in a week or two.\n\nNow, here's where it gets tricky. I work from home, and I have a small home office that faces their backyard. The noise from their kids playing is driving me crazy. I can hear them shouting, laughing, and even screaming, and it's become extremely distracting during work hours. I've tried noise-canceling headphones, but it's still quite disruptive.\n\nSo, yesterday, after yet another afternoon of non-stop noise, I decided to go over and politely ask my neighbors if they could keep it down a bit during my work hours. I didn't want to come off as confrontational, and I even offered to help with suggestions for quieter activities. They didn't take it well at all. They got defensive and accused me of being insensitive to children's need to play and have fun. They said I should understand because I work from home and have more flexibility. It got a bit heated, and they made it clear they weren't going to change anything.\n\nNow, I'm left wondering if I was in the wrong for asking them to control their kids' noise during my work hours.

This fact seems to get overlooked a lot in this old-as-dirt complaint. It's inconsiderate to impose your own bubble of existence onto someone else's... whether it's a house party, screaming kids, or body odor. But dealing with it is just a fact of life.\n\nYou're gunna have to suck it up, unfortunately. Too many people struggle to understand that the \"joy of children's laughter\" is nails on a chalkboard for others. *Especially* if you work from home. It's NOT unreasonable to make the request, especially if you did it politely. But you're not entitled to their acquiescence. So now everyone just has to deal with each other, the struggle of coexisting.", "NTA.   Yes kids in their own yard will always make some noise. But there it can also just be unreasonable and too much. \n\nKids also do not have to all make noise. This is a relatively new concept, I think to compensate for the fact that we are all (incorrectly) obsessed with controlling and monitoring our kids in the name of safety (at a time when any index of danger is at an all time low and with ample evidence that more freedom leads to better adjusted kids). \n\nI am referring here to real life danger. The risk of online stuff that will damage their self esteem is very very real.", "NTA. It's ridiculous to have to deal with noise ALL the time. No one signs up for that, even if you are not working from home. When I was a kid around that age, my parents used to explain to me that I was playing too loud and would tell me to play more quietly when outside or if I woke up early and wanted to play with loud toys.\n\nWe all have to be considerate of each other as we live in society. If you have dogs and they are barking too much, train them or put them back in the house until they calm down. If you have kids, that means teaching them to be quiet sometimes. Kids have to learn to consider other people as well and they are capable of playing quietly and having a good time.", "NTA. Listening to children scream for hours every day while you try to work sounds awful. They won't change though, so you may have to start working elsewhere.", "I think the assholes are the people calling the OP an asshole.  He is entitled because he wants peace and quiet in his home, but there is no entitlement directed to the neighbors with screaming kids?  Yes, they are playing on their own property, but the noise they make doesn't stay on their side of the fence, does it?  \n\nLet's flip the script a bit and say it was the woman's adult children who aren't working sitting in the back talking and playing music loudly all day.  Is it okay to complain about that?  What if  we're talking about a retired person who wants to enjoy some peace and quiet in their own home?  Is he an asshole because he \"chose to retire\"?  What if it's an elderly person who's health is poor?  Again, his fault for \"choosing to be sick\"?\n\nThis is a situation for some compromise, and the OP suggested some quieter activities, but the neighbors care more about \"their rights\" than in being good neighbors.  You want to talk about entitlement?  That is exactly what this mother is teaching her kids.  It's all about them.  Fuck compromising or showing any respect for others.", "Nta", "NTA.\nMost children should be muzzled", "Nothing wrong with asking. It sucks that they wouldn't compromise but I guess they'd rather the kids be outside bothering you, than inside bothering them. \n\nNTA.", "The kids ATAH. EVERYONE around loud children wants them to shut up. I\u2019m sure every adult in this situation would be happy if the kids were quieter. But that\u2019s the thing. Kids are loud. They are TA. I have 4 miniature AH of my own. If my neighbors wanted them to quiet down, id just ask them to lead the way and show me what to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There really is not enough information being provided about the exact levels of noise and their duration, but I do know that some people are more sensitive to noise than others, so it might not take much for the OP to be bothered by it.  I'm more annoyed at the \"black and white\" perspective of the comments where people are calling the OP an asshole when he was seeking a compromise, but, instead, the onus is fully on the OP to soundproof his walls, install thicker windows, wear earplugs, etc. while being called \"entitled\" for wanting some peace and quiet in the home he is working hard to keep and maintain.\n\nThis is not about who is in their legal right to do whatever they are doing, it's about compromising and getting along with others to try to achieve a little more harmony in our existences.
