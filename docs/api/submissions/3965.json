It started with my fianc\u00e9s youngest brother on Thursday, then his second brother last night and now his mother doesn\u2019t feel quite right and he recons it\u2019s only a matter of time before his parents both get it. \n\nThey\u2019re saying they should all be okay to take him this Friday but I\u2019m a little apprehensive and would prefer if he stayed at my dads as he has offered. This is because my son is still on the back end of bronchitis (he was in hospital for it only 2 weeks ago) and the last thing I want to do is even risk him getting norovirus whilst he\u2019s still recovering. I\u2019m being told that I\u2019m too clingy and acting as a helicopter parent because they said they\u2019ll all be okay by Friday but I\u2019m more worried about germs still lingering. \n\nThey\u2019re saying they\u2019d be really upset if they don\u2019t have him, that they\u2019ve been really looking forward for it and they had plans and I feel really guilty and I\u2019m not sure if I would be the a-hole if I refuse to let them look after my son.", "created_utc": 1670189418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcmcnk/wibta_if_i_tell_my_mil_she_cant_watch_my_baby/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It makes no sense to send a kid over to a house full of sick people.", "NTA!! The health of your baby comes first and risking norovirus is absolutely not worth it. I\u2019d almost argue that you\u2019d be TA if you let them have him! He\u2019s super young, his immune system is tired, and norovirus is nasty and very contagious.

Babies immune systems are not as developed and likely experience more distress than an adult at being sick.\n\nThey're being totally unreasonable if they can't understand your concern and are putting their well-being ahead of your child's. Plus, you're the one who will have to care for a very sick infant if he does contract norovirus over the weekend.\n\nNTA absolutely", "NTA! They are being ridiculous.

I\u2019m", "NTA. I would have said there were no AHs until your inlaws started guilting you.

It may be fine for them to have him by that time, but their reaction to it all is concerning.", "NTA. Why would they even want to potentially expose their grandson to illness just because they want to watch him. Seems selfish and irresponsible. They can watch him again when they\u2019re not ill. He\u2019s just a baby.", "NTA \n\nThey should stop the guilt trip. Your child just had bronchitis. Do they not care about him? Goodness! Shame on them!", "Nta.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to expose my child to that either, especially when they have not long come out of hospital.\n\nI can't imagine why anyone would want to look after a young baby when you're ill, or just getting over being ill!", "NTA I\u2019m 25 and it pisses me off so much when people who are sick come to university, when they could just as well stay home. Same with friend who still hang out with me without even giving me a warning that they are sick. Respiratory tract infections and often also digestive system infections are so easily transmissible and people are just reckless. Sure you won\u2019t die from the norovirus or a cold, but it\u2019s still annoying and exhausting to get it. Not to mention a harmless disease in adults can have much different effects for babies, because their immune system is not as strong yet and you can\u2019t force them to stay hydrated or to eat something. Your babies health and safety is more important that your ILs feelings.", "WNBTA\n\nThis is a no brainer... just make the call & rip the band-aid off \u201csorry IL\u2019s.

You don't take chances with a young kid's health and anyone who doesn't understand why it's a problem must not really care about your son and doesn't understand how long viruses can live on surfaces. My 16 month old cousin is just getting over RSV and has had to be hospitalized multiple times. I skipped a family party she was going to be at last weekend because I had a slightly scratchy throat that was probably allergies but I didn't want to risk exposing her to anything with all the illnesses going around right now. That's the choice adults are supposed to make to protect the kids in their lives. Your in laws should understand that and not get angry at you for wanting to be cautious when it comes to your son being exposed to a nasty and highly contagious virus. I'd be tempted to tell your in-laws any nasty comments they make will just make you more likely to let your dad watch your son instead of them the next time you need a sitter. They're acting like childish AHs who would probably expect you to expose your son to Covid if that's what was raging through their house because they're selfish and only care about themselves.", "NTA\n\nyour son\u2019s health trumps their feelings.", "NTA\n\nYour baby\u2019s health is more important than his grandparents\u2019 weekend plans.

That's just being smart not helicopter parenting.", "NTA\nthey suck for insisting on bringing a high risk baby to a high risk area. Arrange for them to have a weekend when they\u2019re feeling better but ultimately where they child goes is up to you and your husband.", "NTA\n\nyour son\u2019s health trumps their feelings.", "OP.. this is your child.  If you feel it is unsafe for your child to be there, then don't send them there.  Who cares what they think, at the end of the day, it is your responsibility to keep him safe.  If you send the child there and the child gets sicker, they will say you were irresponsible and only looking out for yourself and your fun.", "Both babies and health is unpredictable, so both you and they have to deal with it. Asking for a planned visit with the host having a virus that has minimum of 3 days to 2 weeks contamination time is plain silly.\n\nI'm currently sick with my whole family probably because my mom did not keep away long enough. She tought she was well already.", "**NTA**\n\nNo matter what you're NTA for not wanting to send your infant to a house where there's been a nasty virus going around, but gently . . . you shouldn't be asking a bunch of strangers on an Internet page anyway; you shouldn't even be asking your in-laws about whether or not they're contagious, unless they've specifically been told by their doctor. You need to ASK A DOCTOR. So call your paediatrician and explain the situation, and ask what the risk is likely to be, or if you trust your in-laws to be truthful with you, ask them to call their doctor and let you know whether they are likely to still be contagious by the weekend (NOT just a guess), and whether they are willing to do a deep-clean of the house to be safe.\n\nHonestly, though, I would trust your instincts. Anyone who has just been through norovirus - which is AWFUL - and calls you a \"helicopter parent\" or \"clingy\" for not wanting to risk subjecting a vulnerable infant to that is not someone I would trust with my infant to begin with. They sound either very ignorant or very careless with regards to your child's health and safety. There's being overprotective, and then there's not wanting a child who hasn't even had their 6-month shots yet and whose immune system is still incredibly vulnerable not to be exposed to a serious virus. Your in-laws don't sound very responsible. You are NTA.", "No.  Do not expose your baby to potential germs.  Norovirus is awful and he already has a weakened immune system from the bronchitis.  \n\nAlso, I question how much they really care about him if they are willing to call you names because you don't want to take a completely unnecessary risk.  \n\nNTA", "NTA but you probably don\u2019t need to make a call this far in advance. It should be clear in a few days if illness is still a concern. Also, their reaction makes it seem like they\u2019re the clingy ones\u2026", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s good they told your about the illness and didn\u2019t hide it. Let them know there will be another opportunity to babysit, but that you need to have another plan and it\u2019s not fair to have your dad wait and see if he is needed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
