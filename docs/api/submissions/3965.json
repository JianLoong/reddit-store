It started with my fianc\u00e9s youngest brother on Thursday, then his second brother last night and now his mother doesn\u2019t feel quite right and he recons it\u2019s only a matter of time before his parents both get it. \n\nThey\u2019re saying they should all be okay to take him this Friday but I\u2019m a little apprehensive and would prefer if he stayed at my dads as he has offered. This is because my son is still on the back end of bronchitis (he was in hospital for it only 2 weeks ago) and the last thing I want to do is even risk him getting norovirus whilst he\u2019s still recovering. I\u2019m being told that I\u2019m too clingy and acting as a helicopter parent because they said they\u2019ll all be okay by Friday but I\u2019m more worried about germs still lingering. \n\nThey\u2019re saying they\u2019d be really upset if they don\u2019t have him, that they\u2019ve been really looking forward for it and they had plans and I feel really guilty and I\u2019m not sure if I would be the a-hole if I refuse to let them look after my son.\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019ve had a few people tell me I shouldn\u2019t even be going out \n\nI firstly want to say if I felt my son was too unwell to go anywhere then of course I\u2019d stay home with him. But I am his mother so I make that call about whether or not he\u2019s too unwell. He\u2019s just got a cough still and has recovered from the worst, but the doctors told us the cough can linger for a couple of months. \n\nI am absolutely going out because it\u2019s my 25th birthday as well as my best friends wedding and I\u2019ve not really done anything I\u2019ve wanted to do for months. I\u2019ve asked for your opinion on refusing my MIL, I haven\u2019t asked for unwarranted opinions on whether I should be going out at all OR if my dad is responsible. My dad is very responsible and I would never impose on him unless he has offered. I should add he\u2019s desperate to spend time with his grandson as he has never ever spent the day with him alone.

I skipped a family party she was going to be at last weekend because I had a slightly scratchy throat that was probably allergies but I didn't want to risk exposing her to anything with all the illnesses going around right now. That's the choice adults are supposed to make to protect the kids in their lives. Your in laws should understand that and not get angry at you for wanting to be cautious when it comes to your son being exposed to a nasty and highly contagious virus. I'd be tempted to tell your in-laws any nasty comments they make will just make you more likely to let your dad watch your son instead of them the next time you need a sitter.

You need to ASK A DOCTOR. So call your paediatrician and explain the situation, and ask what the risk is likely to be, or if you trust your in-laws to be truthful with you, ask them to call their doctor and let you know whether they are likely to still be contagious by the weekend (NOT just a guess), and whether they are willing to do a deep-clean of the house to be safe.\n\nHonestly, though, I would trust your instincts. Anyone who has just been through norovirus - which is AWFUL - and calls you a \"helicopter parent\" or \"clingy\" for not wanting to risk subjecting a vulnerable infant to that is not someone I would trust with my infant to begin with. They sound either very ignorant or very careless with regards to your child's health and safety.

Doctor told us that will linger for a month or two. \n\nMy dad is a responsible person, he\u2019s raised 4 children, and he\u2019s desperate to spend time with his grandson as he has never done this before.

Maybe reconsider their access to your lo completely", "Because I deserve a break?", "This!", "Don't come on AITA and ask not to be guilted, princess.", "Of course you do. \n\nThe baby deserves a parent to whom he is close and is familiar. Better if you can have regular breaks on a daily basis. I hope you can find a way that works for you all.\n\nIMO, in relation to bonding,  it is strange that you want that length of separation and not a good thing, though understandable if there is a medical need or other emergency.\n\nI am sorry if you don't like my comment and I appreciate that you didn't ask for this.\n\nDoes your baby even know your Dad and your Dad the baby?  You say he has never cared for the baby alone for a day.\n\nWill the baby be protected from smokers? (Bronchitis recently)", "Midwife said it\u2019s perfectly acceptable, and healthy, to allow a baby to stay with people we trust, HV has also said the same. He\u2019s not a newborn, he\u2019s nearly 6 months old. We are very close and very well bonded and he\u2019s spent a few weekends away before at my in laws, one of them was when my partner had surgery and I was very poorly and neither of us could provide the care for him. \n\nI can\u2019t get regular daily breaks at all, my baby doesn\u2019t nap very well, and will go down for 20 minute tops and in that time I\u2019m eating my first meal of the day, doing the worlds biggest laundry pile, sterilising or making bottles. So no, I don\u2019t get regular breaks through the day. My other half works full time and gets home when we\u2019re starting bedtime routine so I can\u2019t just ask him to take him for an hour. \n\nIt\u2019s my 25th birthday and my best friends wedding so I will be going regardless what people say or think. My dad and step mother don\u2019t smoke, they are fantastic with children and he\u2019s spent time with his grandson before just not without me. My son loves his grandad and his grandmother and the two youngest. He loves playing with them and they live on a farm and he loves the animals. \n\nI\u2019ll be going over the night before to go through the routine and so my dad isn\u2019t lost and so my son is used to the house, I did this the first time he stayed at my in-laws as well, but as I\u2019ve said in previous comments, he\u2019s raised 2 kids into adulthood and is currently bringing up 2 young children of his own. I trust him the most out of anyone."]}
