The message stated that they had been considering names for their unborn son, and \u201cLuka\u201d was at the top of their list. She said she didn\u2019t want us to be surprised if that\u2019s what they decide to name their child, and wanted to be considerate of our feelings. \n\nAfter discussing this together my wife and I both agreed that the choice of name would make it painful for us to see these friends and their child whether it be in person or on social media. \n\nThese particular friends both have a unique racial makeup as both my wife and I, and our son and their daughter could pass as siblings. We both thought that seeing their Luka grow up would be difficult, and that we would always wonder if that\u2019s what our boy would be doing/ look like. \n\nWe don\u2019t live close to these friends, but our lines of work so bring us in close proximity every handful of years. Our relationship at the level where we would stop by to visit them on a cross country drive, talk on social media, and exchange Christmas cards. When we lived in the same city we had the same social network and that same social network corresponds regularly. \n\nMy wife messaged our friends and asked them to reconsider their name choice, because of the pain it would cause us. They replied back that it was a name then had wanted to use for years and would honor their family\u2019s line of work (not a family name, just so happens to mean what the dad and grandfather did for work in another language).\n\nIt sounds like they was already decided what they want to name the baby, but I don\u2019t know why they would go through with it if it would hurt us. I know we don\u2019t own the name, but it seems extremely insensitive to us. We\u2019re not only grieving the loss of our baby, but all the future things he won\u2019t be able to do and see. We\u2019ll never stop grieving his loss and I don\u2019t think they truly care for our baby or friendship if they do this.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I asked them not to name their child the same name as my baby boy?

Firstly, genuinely sorry to hear of your loss. I hope you and your wife are doing okay. But yeah they have every right to name their kid whatever they want. If it\u2019s too much for you too be around, limit contact to the bare minimum to protect your own mental health. But they certainly aren\u2019t evil for naming their kid the name they chose", "NTA, you can ask. They just don't have to listen", "NAH - You don\u2019t own the name, so they technically are free to use it as they please. But I understand not wanting to be around another baby with the same name as your son. \n\nI do wonder if it would make them feel awkward about it\u2026. Not the best memory to associate your child with.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss :(", "NTA but you can't stop them.\n\nI do think it's really uncool there are so many names out there.

I can't imagine why they would even want to, let alone be insistent on it.", "NAH. I am so sorry for your loss. My husband lost his 18month old son and I\u2019ve been there for him through years of his grief. It won\u2019t ever end, and I\u2019ve seen how he gets when his son\u2019s name comes up in normal life circumstances. His son\u2019s name was very common, so it pops up a lot and I can see how much it hurts him. If friends of ours wanted to name their child the same name, I know it would just torment him. I would suggest distance. We can\u2019t control what other people do, but controlling our own actions is important for our peace. Again, so sorry for your loss.", "NAH.\n\nYou can communicate how it makes you feel...but ultimately it is up to them what name they use. You then just need to decide how you will deal with it.

I\u2019m sorry for your loss and understand why you would prefer they didn\u2019t use the name, but aside from the fact that it\u2019s a family name for them, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re actually that close and won\u2019t see them particularly often. \n\nYou\u2019re basically opposed to the concept of them using the name, because it isn\u2019t actually going to affect your lives that much.

No parent should bury their child.  As far as the name,  I understand your feelings but at the same time that name also has a special meaning for your friends based on what you wrote.

It's time to cut ties.  That's pretty low life thing to do.", "Not going to say yall are assholes, but neither are your friends. Names are names. There's a million Luka's out there. Your friends let you know as not to blind side you, however for you to tell them they can't name their OWN child that, is fucked up.

Mute them on social media to not see them if that helps you keep a peace of mind.", "I am sorry for your loss but yes, YTA. They were giving you a heads up not asking for permission. You turned a polite warning into a family discussion and then an attempt to change their minds. A simple \"Thank you for letting us know\" is all that needed to be said, especially over message. If you really felt the need to discuss a phone call where tone and such can be determined would have been the better route to go.", "YTA because your wife already asked and they said no.  \n\nYou are absolutely entitled to your feelings of pain over your loss and hurt over their decision. If you feel that you can no longer maintain a friendship with them, that's valid and you are allowed to end the friendship. \n\nOn the other hand, they are allowed to choose a name that means something to them and they've given you a solid reason for why this name is special. It's not like they just like the way it sounds and they didn't choose the name because they wanted to hurt you.", "YWBTA. they are trying to be considerate of you by reaching out, and it is something that ultimately should not end your relationship with them, honestly. \n\ni am very sorry for your loss though.", "Gentle, I\u2019m sorry for your loss but I also get where you\u2019re coming from but then too: ESH. How distant do people need to be before they are permitted to use the name? \n\nKeep your mouth shut, unfollow on social media, and distance your friendship with them. I hope you are getting grief counseling to help you handle future things that will inevitably affect you and your grief. It\u2019s hard.", "YWBTA. I'm sorry for your loss. No one should have to lose a child, especially one that young. But your loss doesn't mean the world stops or that you get to dictate how others live their lives.

Ask them to change their name so that you aren't reminded of your son?", "NTA and those \u201cfriends\u201d don\u2019t sound like good friends.", "NTA. Perfectly reasonable.", "Sorry but ywbta. Your grief will be the same whether you run into a Luka, Lucas, a kid that even looks like it could be yours or a kid with a completely different name and look doing something you hoped your son would do. That's just how grief works. Feel free to limit following your friends while you adjust but let them be. \n\nI wish you and your wife well.", " YTA, this is their child, not yours. You have no business telling friends, regardless of how close you may or may not be, what to name their child.", "NTA. Ask them to either not select the name or not make it the first name. They can honour the work by having it as a middle name. Just explain how it will impact you emotionally, like you did in the post. It may help them see it from your view. If they do pick it as the first name, you will need to decide if that would result in you needing to cut all contact.", "Those are not your friends. If they were, they would\u2019ve chosen a different name and not even mention that they were thinking about the same name your baby had. I get why a lot of people on here are saying n a h but honestly it\u2019s really rotten of your \u201cfriends\u201d to do that to you both. ESPECIALLY since you just lost your child 7 months ago.\n\nThose aren\u2019t the kind of people you want in your lives! Don\u2019t argue with them, just let it go and stop communicating.\n\nNTA but cut contact with these \u201cfriends.\u201d I\u2019m truly very sorry for your loss.

I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re mostly from users who aren\u2019t parents. I can\u2019t imagine how I would cope if I lost either my son or daughter. There is no loss that could come close. No idea what your so called friends could be thinking, but with the millions of names there are to choose from, if the ONLY one they can go with is that of your beloved late son, they are absolutely not your friends and should be sliced cleanly and permanently out of your lives. \n\nOP & Wife, I\u2019m so, so sorry.

If it was a family member doing this I would say that they WBTA, but since it is a friend, who you only see on social media/ pictures a majority of the time I don't think they are in the wrong unfortunately.", "Gentle YTA. It sounds like they were informing you to be considerate, not asking for permission. Despite this your wife did ask and was told no. Asking again is only going to achieve the same outcome but prolong your pain. You could instead tell them thank you for the years of friendships you\u2019ve had but as this will be a constant trigger for you you and your wife will be removing them from all social media and no longer wish to have any communication with them. If you have to see each other in professional settings then you\u2019d prefer only business discussions.", "YWBTA if you were family or super close friend I would get it. It doesn\u2019t sound like you would actually be apart of their child life. Sure you would see the kid online but you wouldn\u2019t actually be apart of seeing the kid. A possible annual visit isn\u2019t enough to change the name they may set on.  I understand your pain. I too have lost a child. It\u2019s so hard. You\u2019ll always wonder, you\u2019ll always feel little pulls on your heart but the pain does get easier. I recommend therapy for yourself and your partner. I think it\u2019s the only reason I was able to make it through. You guys have this and each other.\nHonestly your partner is the only one who\u2019s going to get it. Hold tight to each other but don\u2019t spend time on this name. Let this have it and focus on each other", "YTA \n\nYour wife asked and they said no\n\nYou don\u2019t get to decided\n\nBut actions have consequences\n\nIf you cannot be friends with them if they use the same name that is fine \n\nAs you said, you don\u2019t see them often, don\u2019t live close and only have them on social media\n\nYou could delete/block them", "YWBTA - you can\u2019t control what other people do, only how you respond. Your friends have already indicated to your wife that they are not willing to reconsider. You\u2019re just setting yourself up for failure if you tell them not to use that name.

You don\u2019t hang out regularly so it won\u2019t affect  you majority of the time. Most people have a list they like for a majority of their lives, it doesn\u2019t change sometimes through the years but if it\u2019s at the top of their list, it probably has for a very long time. I\u2019m sorry you lost your little boy and no one should ever go through that, but it\u2019s their life and they get to choose what they name their child.", "Your wife already asked once. If they're set on using the name, it's their choice.", "Let's just say that they're not the assholes. You guys aren't all that close, the name means something to them, and they were sensitive enough to know that they shouldn't spring this news on you without warning.", "NTA perhaps write a message that you will have to stop talking and seeing them for a while if they choose that name due to the pain it would cause you and your wife. If they still pick the name then go no contact. They should have never asked your opinion as it doesn\u2019t seem to have changed their mind. Perhaps tell a few mutual friends why you are no or low contact so they understand why it\u2019s happening. You get to protect yourself.", "NTA, they are stepping WAY out of line. who looks at the name of a friends DEAD CHILD and goes, \"oh hey, this is cute\". These people are either idiotic or hate you.", "Esh. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for being hurt but it\u2019s crossing a line to tell other people what to name their kids. \n\nThey\u2019re assholes for not being more considerate of what you guys went through. \n\nI\u2019d just be honest with them and tell them you won\u2019t be able to remain friends with them if this is the choice they go with.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think they did it to hurt you, but rather reached out so you weren\u2019t blindsided.", "NAH - Sounds like ya\u2019ll aren\u2019t friends, though.", "YWBTA. They are not friends, they are acquaintances. You barely see them every few years you said. Unfollow them on all socials.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but yes, YWBTA. You already have your answer. There\u2019s no difference between asking them to reconsider - to which they essentially said no - so asking them to NOT use the name isn\u2019t going to get any other answer. My heart breaks for you but you have their answer and I don\u2019t think revisiting it will do anything except more harm and pain.", "NTA - but it sounds like they\u2019re not your friends and it\u2019s ok to cut them off.", "You know it was a huge movie last year right?", "Gentle YTA, I understand that you find this hurtful but I think you've misunderstood the intention of them telling you. They aren't asking your permission or for your blessing their giving you a quiet heads up.\n\nIt's not as though you'll see them daily or be forced to interact with them often.\n\nYou have every right to feel upset, you don't have the right to tell them they can't use a name that's fairly common anyway.", "NTA. I honestly can\u2019t fathom why anyone would want to knowingly inflict pain on people you claim as friends over a name. There are literally thousands of names to choose from. Anyway that\u2019s just my opinion. \nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, OP. I truly am \u2665\ufe0f", "YTA and I\u2019m sorry for your loss but you can\u2019t trademark a name\u2026\n\n\nLet alone a very common one.", "NTA and I'm not sure they're friends. I would never consider choosing a friend's deceased child's name, or a living one for that matter, especially as it only reflects a family job not an actual name.\n\nI do appreciate that it also means something to them and they're giving you future knowledge of it and you've advised that you would be upset and you have no control over what they do name their child.\n\nI think going NC would be best because I think your friendship is already sullied by the fact they've even considered it and I don't think you'll get over that, especially if they end up not going with it.\n\nVery sorry for your loss, I can't imagine the pain.", "NAH. It\u2019s understandable if you stop being friends with them", "Yes exactly as r/whateverworks1470 said. Definitely NTA. Your feelings are 100% valid. Unfortunately even asking them not to name their child with the same name they are not obligated to do so. Best thing to do would be to congratulate them and part ways. I don't even know if I would announce it as it's like handing them an ultimatum but just gradually cut ties and remove from social media.  Nobody can know the pain you are feeling unless experienced. Sending lots of love your way.\ud83d\udc95", "Agreed. One thing I think I will mention tho is in my opinion it was decent of them to let OP and his wife know in advance in private rather than being told at the last minute in a public place surrounded by others, which I have seen a number of times on here.", "This is really good. Precisely this.", "They won\u2019t listen. If they are so inconsiderate they won\u2019t suddenly start to care. NTA", "That's kind of the point though isn't it. They aren't friends, let alone close friends. They are business acquaintances that happen to be the same race and communicate briefly several times a year.\n\nOP could block these people and never notice the difference. In fact, that is what he should do. It is awful that OP lost a child, but it has literally nothing to do with the new child being born.", "NAH is correct, but I just think the right thing to do in my opinion is change the name.  That\u2019s what I would do if I were the friend.  I just think it\u2019s hella fucked up, it\u2019s like a horrible memento of your loss.  But, that\u2019s a personal standard, and no one owns a name.", "Thank you for sharing your story. I\u2019m so sorry you lost your beautiful baby boy. I hate this for all of us. Our son\u2019s birthday is coming up soon and I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to handle it. \n\nNo one but other bereaved parents really gets this level of loss. It\u2019s all consuming. So many people say and do such insensitive things- it\u2019s insane.\n\nNo one tells you that when your child passes, you\u2019ll also lose friends and family as well. We\u2019ve also gained and strengthened some beautiful friendships as well. \n\nSending you love and hugs wherever you are.", "They didnt do that, they are using a name that has special meaning to them and is a family name.", "His name isn\u2019t Luka. It\u2019s just a placeholder for this post. Don\u2019t want to get doxxed.", "Why NTA instead of NAH ?", "They aren't inconsiderate for using a name.", "Yet close enough to ask them about it. I wouldn\u2019t ask a rando business acquaintance for their thoughts I would ask a semi distant family friend i see rarely, but cared for.", "Yet they're close enough to contact OP and let them know.", "My cousin named his son after his dead younger brother as a tribute. His daughter after his mom whole was born the day she died. Familys do this all the time and it usually is taken as a compliment or not an insult as its not about you in this case.", "You seem to be implying that by using the name Luke they are somehow taking it away from your son. They aren't, they're just using the name for their child that feels right to them, same as you did at some point. NAH, you can go no contact with them to avoid the painful association.", "No idea.... my mind just went to Not The AH instead of Not AH.... I guess I never noticed I was typing something different \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It depends on their relationship with OP I guess. I would never in a million years use the name of a friends recently deceased child, no matter how much I liked it. That's... I mean that's fucked up. \n\nNow, if they friends do not consider OP to be *their* friend or don't consider themselves close with them, that's slightly different. \n\nI still would feel really gross about using the name of a baby I actually knew that died within the same year for my own child, though. There's a *lot* of names out there. I don't think OP would be at all out line for no longer involving these people in their lives at all."]}
