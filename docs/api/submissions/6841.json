If you break something you replace it. Shame on her.", "NTA. Your sister, however, is a colossal AH.\n\nAny halfway decent person would apologize and offer to replace the broken object ($30, ffs).

In your shoes, I would be banning sister from my home.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd as an aunt who actually loves my nieces and nephews, I can't IMAGINE being so casually indifferent to their feelings or treating them so dismissively. The whole way you describe her interaction with him - barely even looking up from her phone when he calls her over excitedly, BREAKING HIS NEW PUZZLE and then hardly even glancing up to apologise - just reeks of self-absorption and immaturity. Honestly, I wouldn't even want a family member like that around my child.
