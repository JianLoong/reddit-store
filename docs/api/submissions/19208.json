You didn't make your nieces cry - your sister did. A 3 year old might not understand the concept of a birthday gift being given to one person and not another, but the older sibling can certainly be made to get why their baby sister was given a baby's toy to not feel left out. This is a parenting fail, not an auntie fail. Your sister should have handled that herself instead of asking you to a take a toy away from a small child and then blaming you for the kid being upset.", "NTA. I have family who live in a different town and I do the same thing. I have family who do it for my kids too. Thank god my children and nieces and nephews are nice people. My kid just had her fifth birthday and got two $50 bills just for her and straight up gave one to her sister and her sister does the same thing at her birthday and it's the sweetest lol. We also have family friends who live close but will literally buy and wrap a present for both kids on both birthdays haha just cause they love spoiling our kids. Your nieces reaction was a bit yikes haha. I would be having a stern talking to my daughter if she behaved like that about something so small.", "NTA. Your sister is being mental, and this really needed to be harnessed into a learning moment for the 7-year-old. The toy was clearly not meant for her--it was a squeaky toy for babies, not big girls. The 3-year-old getting a present from long-distance Auntie did not reduce the number of presents that the 7-year-old got. The whole, \"You don't need to blow somebody else's candle out to make yours burn brightly\" type of thing. \n\nI would imagine that the 7-year-old would not normally be interested in squeaky baby toys... she was just upset that her sister got a present on \"her day.\" It's not like you walked in with a cake and a crown for the 3-year-old. It was still the 7-year-old's day, squeaky toy or no. This is a red flag reaction from the 7-year-old that Mom needed to nip in the bud, not get indignant about potential ruined photo ops. \n\nIt's important to celebrate people on their birthdays, but this is a shade too far and the reaction of the 7-year-old is ungenerous, at best. Of course, she's *seven* and it is to be expected to a certain extent, but this sort of tantrum should be corrected, not encouraged. \n\nTA here is your sister, as she handled this very badly. I wouldn't be surprised if L and K end up with a tumultuous sibling relationship, frankly. Sounds like your sis might be inadvertently promoting a rivalry.", "Where I live, some people are trying to make this a thing, and to be honest I don't understand why this could possibly be necessary and find it really strange. That said, if it's common where you are I would go with not the asshole. If it's not common where you are, it would be a soft you're the asshole because for things like this you always ask the parents first.", "YTA. Simply put, the person that is not celebrating their birthday does not get presents. This should be common sense. What you did just started a slippery slope of the 3-year-old thinking they're entitled to presents on their sister's birthday. And as you saw, it made the 7-year-old feel like her birthday didn't matter, and she can't have a day all to herself without her younger sister being involved. So you also started older sister's resentment for younger sister. If you were afraid you were going to forget the present the next morning, you could have just set a reminder on your phone for a time before you left.", "I'm going to say YTA here. I get that you wanted to treat both the kids, but there's a time and place for everything. It may have been better to give the younger kid the gift after the party. Or, you could have talked to mom to let her know what you were going to do. That way the birthday girl would have known what to expect.  The gesture was sweet, the execution was not well thought out.", "YTA\n\nI remember being younger and on my birthdays, my brother also got a gift because \"he felt left out\". I don't blame him because he was a kid, but it always upset me that when I voiced my frustrations my family would make me out to be selfish because \"you're getting so many presents and he is only getting one!\". The point was it was ***my*** birthday! I didn't get anything on his birthday because \"I was older and more mature\" (older by three years). \n\nWhat you did was shitty. Time and place.", "YTA. You do not give a child presents at their siblings birthday. You just don't. Did you really think this wasn't going to cause an issue? \n\n\"In my defense, I was leaving early in the morning and I didn't want to forget about it.\" is not a defence. Put in an alarm and note on your phone if you are so forgetful. This is just a shitty excuse for bad etiquette. You totally could have waiting for K to enjoy her party before you gave L anything.", "NTA my family has always done this if there is a party and there are younger siblings. The littles ones don't understand and it helps keep them occupied while their sibling is being fussed over.", "Yta sorry but the only time to NOT give her sis a gift was during her bday party.  You were leaving early in the morning? So you had the evening after the party and the morning before you left.\n\nIts a minor thing but doubling down on 'I didnt do anything wrong!!' is not helping your case.", "Soft YTA because while I think there was nothing wrong with getting your other niece a present, there\u2019s a time and place and you shouldn\u2019t have done so without the parent\u2019s permission", "YTA there is a time and a place and it isn\u2019t here. Do you get the 7 year old presents on the 3 year olds birthday? Or is she too old for that. It\u2019s the 7 year olds birthday and at least during the party her sister shouldn\u2019t be getting presents just because you are to scared to tell her it\u2019s not her birthday. \n\nAnd in the case the 3 year old didn\u2019t even care then you created a whole situation that shouldn\u2019t have happened", "NTA in my country its actually very normal to do this when the younger sibling is so young they dont really understand why one get gifts and not the other, so until 4 years old or so its common to bring a small gift for the non birthday kid aswell\n\nAnd the older children understand why, we explain that little kid is so little they dont quite grasp the concept yet of birthdays, they just see big kid gets gift and not me, in reverse we generally also do it until youngest is out of the age group\n\nSo if younger kid has a birthday the older one gets a little token aswell even if they understand it already\n\nI honestly dont understand the attitude you got at all", "YTA. You gave the gift during the party! It would have been different if you had waited until the party was over and all the guests were gone. You made a little girl cry at her own party.", "YTA. That's how we get videos of small children blowing out someone else's candles or doing other crazy stuff because they weren't taught that birthday is about the birthday person, and adults enabling them", "YTA. You don\u2019t give someone else a present during the birthday person\u2019s party. Even adults would be upset, let alone a 7 year old.", "INFO: Did you miss the kids birthday or Christmas and this their gift or did you just decide to give the kid a random present at another kids birthday party? If it\u2019s the ladder the I can understand why mom is upset. That\u2019s it NOT the kind of thing you would want a kid to start expecting.", "YTA, the younger sibling likely takes much of the time and attention from the parents, as it should be. But for one day, the older sibling gets to be in the spotlight, with friends and family doting on her. \nThis is how you create children who have to be the centre of attention at every event, even ones not for them.\nDo you buy a present for the older one for the younger ones' birthday, or are they expected to \"know better\" at expect nothing?", "YTA. You don't give a child a gift on their siblings birthday. What is wrong with you?", "A soft YTA. Was your sister out of line, absolutely but you can't expect a child to not get upset when you give someone else a present at their birthday party. The practice of doing so is a little ridiculous, why can't the birthday child get one day with it being about them and not a sibling.", "YTA Child must learn it\u2019s someone else\u2019s day.", "YTA Is like stealing the thunder at a wedding by announcing an engagement or pregnancy. You really should have given it the next day.  You can set a reminder on your phone. Parents must teach their children that a birthday is for one child, not the others. It's past of their socialization. You should have at least asked mom. Unfortunately, you ruined the older kid's day .  Apologies are in order.", "NTA. You did the right thing by giving it to her unwrapped and discreetly, though. Your sister could have used this as a valuable teaching moment.", "YTA. \n\nIt wasn't L's birthday, it was K's.", "NTA your sister clearly has a favorite. The 7 year old is old enough to understand and the 3 year old isn\u2019t and your sister is ok with hurting L so K can be happy I\u2019m no", "I think NTA but in general giving presents to a different kid at someone else's birthday party is a bad idea. \n\nI'd have suggested giving the birthday girl one of her presents on her birthday, then after the party give both neices a (both wrapped or both unwrapped) gift at the same time explaining it's not a birthday gift, it's an \"auntie/uncle missed you gift\".\n\nThe excuse that you were leaving early the next day and didn't want to forget is kinda lame. I mean for one, you can just leave the gifts out on top of your suitcase, and for two you could also tell your sister about the gifts ahead of time so she could remind you.\n\nYou could have done that regarding the younger niece's gift at the party too and your sister could have said \"no\" and prevented all this, or have been prepped to talk down the birthday girl.\n\nHer demanding you give all 3 gifts to the birthday girl makes her an A though.", "NTA at all. With young children i do the same, specially with nieces. Everybody gets a gift, the birthday child a better one, but the siblings a small gift for them to know we also thought about them. The mother was wrong for having that attitude. Aldo...i never had the bithday child acting so jealousy from sister/brother...", "NTA. My sisters are 6/7 years younger than me. Every birthday when they were young they\u2019d get a few little \u00a3 items just to keep them occupied. It meant the attention was more on me as it kept them occupied rather than wanting what I had!", "NTA, K needs to learn about boundaries or something and your sister shouldn\u2019t be pandering to their outburst.\n\nTaking the toy away from L is fucked.", "NTA. I think what you did was really sweet and it especially makes sense since it was unwrapped and you don't get to see them that often.", "ESH, but unfortunately mostly you. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty basic etiquette not to give one child a gift at another child\u2019s birthday party. I understand you were trying to do something nice for L, but this is the one day a year that K gets to feel special, and you ruined that for her. \n\nThink about it. As the older sibling how often does K get told she needs to cater to her little sister? How often do you think L\u2019s needs come as a priority to people because \u201cshe\u2019s younger and K should understand.\u201d K is only 7. She deserves to have *one day* be about her, not L. \n\nAfter it was said and done though, taking the toy away from L to give to K was an AH move on your sister\u2019s part. It only served to create more drama. She should have just said to play with it later or not in front of K.\n\nYou made K cry. Your sister made L cry. This was a situation created by poor forethought, but in the end both of you suck.", "Info:  Do you bring K a gift on Ls birthday? If so, NTA.\n\nIf this is just for L because she\u2019s younger, you\u2019re a huge AH and K will recognize the favoritism as she gets older.  That the little sister gets more just because she\u2019s younger.", "If the kids are small, I always bring the other a small present too. NTA. This is pretty common and thoughtful actually.", "NTA - 7 is old enough to not lose your shit over this. We can conjecture all we want that maybe she's tired of sharing the spotlight with her younger sibling, she misses the attention, it's her birthday, whatever. But at the end of the day, she got two special presents from her family member who made a special trip just for her! And then her younger sibling got a gift away from the spotlight. This should not have provoked such a reaction, and your sister was absolutely wrong in how she handled it. She made your nieces cry, not you.", "NTA\n\nWhen me and my brother were younger we'd usually get an \"unbirthday present\" from parents and sometimes grandparents and aunts & uncles. This was a much smaller present than whoever's birthday it was just so we didn't feel left out. It never made the person who's birthday it was mad or cause this sort of tantrum.\n\nYour sister need to stop treating K like a spoiled brat. You are not the asshole.\n\nEDIT: Reading comments saying Y T A I'm doubling down on my NTA vote. It wasn't wrapped, you gave it to L after K had her presents and ran off to play. You didn't make a fanfare of it. You don't see them often, and its clear L was getting very little attention of any sort. I'm sure family members that live closer will bring little things for the kids every now and again, you're just making up for that. You're a good auntie and it's not you who made her cry. You should buy L three presents for her next birthday.", "NTA\n\nOne day that girl is going to encounter someone who shares her birthday and all hell is going to break loose.", "When my son's oldest birthday came around, she had 2 little brothers.

I did the same for each kids birthday til they were old enough to understand.", "NTA. I thought this practice was pretty common--to bring a small little toy for a young sibling, or, for another example, with a new baby gift, a small something for an older sibling.

This is on their mother.", "NTA. This is pretty standard practice to make sure REAL little kids don't feel left out because they don't quite understand birthday parties and presents. Unwrapped was a good idea too because some parents will let little siblings \"help\" unwrap gifts, which would be stealing thunder.

I\u2019m really close in age with them. I can\u2019t remember why but my dad bought me a small action figure or something as a reward for something or the other. Idk maybe like a report card lol. My cousin and I must have been 6 or 7. He made the mistake of giving it to me in front of my cousin and it made my cousin kind of upset, and my dad felt bad and bought him a pack of like Pokemon cards or something. \n\nI don\u2019t know. Kids are just really sensitive about attention and being slighted etc etc and it\u2019s not that they are materialistic but that they just are bad at understanding non tangible forms of affection and reward at that age. I\u2019m a lot older and I don\u2019t really give a shit whether or not someone buys me a birthday gift; I honestly feel a lot happier when someone I care about sends me a meaningful text or gives me a phone call. My cousin also doesn\u2019t really care about receiving tangible gifts either, from what I can tell. \n\nAll this is to say, I think people are overestimating how much receiving a gift is going to spoil the three year old and desolate the seven year old. Kids shouldn\u2019t get whatever they want, but everyone likes little displays of affection, and I think kids are no different. Maybe things are different now with lots of kids having very expensive electronics, but when I was younger (not too long ago) even something small and cheap from a parent would send us over the moon. \n\nThey\u2019ll both be fine, but, yes, you should have waited for a more opportune moment and your sister shouldn\u2019t have defaulted to confiscating the toy and giving it to the birthday girl.", "YTA.

But when it's LO bday the older child gets nothing extra.   I don't think parents or the families mean to make this happen, but they do it anyway because it's \"easier\" than dealing with an upset, tantrum-screaming child.   In your case though it sounds like your sister is going to make sure that DOESN'T happen...because she's going to favor the elder child and sacrifice the younger one's feelings no mater what.

We've never had an issue.  I am concerned that one baby toy can make the 7yo spiral and throw her birthday crown.  Then mom rewards this behavior, by taking the toddler toy away from the toddler.

At 3/4 years old its a teachable moment that some days will be your special day and some days will be someone else's. Also the world isn't always fair or revolves around 1 person.
