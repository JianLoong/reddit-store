Parents aren\u2019t parenting her.", "selftext": "Okay so basically I moved into this new apartment complex. I understand apartment living isn\u2019t perfect and there will be plenty of times you hear your neighbors or you just have to put something aside and get over it. \n\nHowever, since I have moved in I have not been able to have a full night of rest due to my neighbor\u2019s child. If I had to guess I would say she\u2019s about two years old. She isn\u2019t a newborn. She scream cries for hours. I mean hours. Usually anywhere from 2 am to 6 am. From what I can tell/hear her parents don\u2019t do anything to comfort her or calm her down. I would understand if she were younger, but she\u2019s old enough that they could talk to her a little more or calm her down by going on a drive or something. They also have a dog that barks all of the time, and doesn\u2019t seem to be trained. So I think there\u2019s just a lack of parenting. The mom is also pregnant. I was hoping this was a temporary situation, I thought maybe they were moving and between houses, but it doesn\u2019t seem that way.\n\nWhat\u2019s confusing is they are in a one bedroom apartment in a fancy complex, and where I live it would be cheaper to rent a small house. Our apartment complex isn\u2019t very kid friendly, there is no elevator yet, and so they are having their daughter walk up 4 flights of stairs whenever they come or go. Which may not seem like a big deal, but if I were a parent with a small child I wouldn\u2019t pick this apartment to live in.\n\nMy issue is less with the crying toddler, and more so with the parents. I don\u2019t think they know how to parent. \n\nI\u2019m getting irritable because I can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019ve tried putting headphones on, blasting the tv, it doesn\u2019t matter she screams so loud. \n\nAm I the asshole if I file a noise complaint as a sort of wake up call to the parents? I genuinely feel bad for the little girl, and I can\u2019t imagine what it will be like when the new baby comes.\n\n\nEdit for more context: I\u2019ve heard them tell her to shut up, I\u2019ve seen them at the pool and they don\u2019t watch her, they also let her run up and down the halls of our apartment complex without keeping an eye on her, which is a full blown construction zone right now. I am being critical of their parenting but it\u2019s because of the things I\u2019ve witnessed. I understand that they can parent their child however they want, they can live wherever they want, but their choices are impacting other people. Everyone here is pretty quiet. It was marketed with grad students and young professionals in mind. We have quiet study rooms. She\u2019s also the only child in the whole place which makes me feels a bit sad for her.

So...not sure how much we can trust their awareness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, I think she should still try to talk to them before going straight for the complaint.", "There\u2019s also an occasional \u201cshut up\u201d\u2026they don\u2019t watch her by the pool\u2026.there isn\u2019t a lot of awareness", "right but saying \u201cbe quiet\u201d and \u201ccalm down\u201d really aren\u2019t effective ways of soothing a toddler. they\u2019re kind of known for not being reasonable.", "I'm saying that if you have kids, don't disturb others. I lived in appartments my all life, i have/had neighbours with newborns, toddlers etc. I have never had this problem, i never heard the kids yelling non stop like this. So it's possible for parents to parent.", "I agree 100 percent, but I\u2019ve seen them around the complex. They don\u2019t watch her. Mom is always on her phone, the little girl looks desperate for her attention. They don\u2019t watch her around the apartment complex which is an issue because it\u2019s a full blown construction site right now.", ">You don\u2019t get to just force everyone to behave in a way to minimize your own discomfort.\n\nYou also don't get to force others to put up with your lack of parenting. If your kid screams for hours, it's a you problem, so you should solve it ( by isolating the walls, by moving, by whatever else works). \n\n I'm pretty sure appartments have a rule that you can't make much noise after 10pm.", "Yeah I don\u2019t necessarily want them to get evicted. I guess I wanted them to parent which I\u2019m quickly realizing is stupid because one noise complaint isn\u2019t going to do that. I just feel bad for the little girl. She\u2019s not happy and I\u2019m not sleeping.", "I would say I\u2019m a bit concerned. Like I said I\u2019ve never heard a child meltdown so frequently and like that. But I would never want to make an assumption that big and hurt their family.", "As long as they make it be quiet i don't care.", "Have you consider that maybe, they don't have a choice ? That they live there for free ?", "That beast isn't going to shut up for quite some time.  Document when it is disturbing the peace and quiet.  Be diligent.  Report it.  You won't be the only one doing this.\n\nIt takes a village to raise a child, but only one child to royally fuck up the whole village.\n\nI really dislike children.  When one is heading towards the flight I'm on, and it's already being loud and crying, I just imagine it's wailing for both of us.  I hate it, it hates something else, so I'm adding my screams to its screams so I can remain composed and without any snot, crumbs, or drool on me.", "Ah, the storyline evolves\u2026", "You seem to be under the misapprehension that parents have complete control over their child\u2019s behavior at every moment, and that any bit of undesirable behavior is due solely to bad parenting.  Hopefully you will never get smacked upside the head by having a child of your own that is a poor sleeper.", "Could very well be shit parents, but I guess the broader point is, their parenting style is not the problem you need to solve. I just don\u2019t think making assumptions about them is going to help you here. They have the right to make noise. They have the right to not give their child as much attention as the child would prefer. They have the right to let their kid cry. Not saying they aren\u2019t shit parents and people, but you need to focus on solving your own problem, not in making assumptions about how other people should solve theirs.", "Nobody lives here for free. It\u2019s on the more expensive side, and it\u2019s highly competitive to get into right now. As they only have limited spots since it\u2019s under construction. There are many apartments in the area that are far more affordable and more family friendly", "Also I said she typically scream cries at night, I actually don\u2019t know how frequently it happens during the day because I\u2019m at school. So it\u2019s probably happening even more than I realize.", "Like i said, i lived in appartments next to toddlers/newborns my whole life and i never once was disturbed by them crying. So obviously something can be done.", "Agree with you, they can live however they want. Part of me just feels bad for the little girl. And I need sleep. I\u2019m going to try ear plugs, but I\u2019ve tried about everything else.", "How do you know that ? Maybe someone is renting the apartment for them ? \n\nAre you always such a know-it-all about other people's business ?", "So add to your record the time you arrive home and head out with the same sheet.  Easy peasy. Plenty of people working from home or taking night shifts will fill in the gaps in their own reports.", "Ah, ignorance mixed with arrogance.", "Okay even if what you are saying could be true\u2026I don\u2019t think it matters. The environment that they moved into is a very quiet environment. They are not quiet.", "If the parents aren't able to keep thrir kid from screaming for hourse, then they should invest in something to isolate the walls. Or move to the woods. Idc, as long as i don't have to listen to it", "Mind your own business. Report the noise if it bothers you and stop judging people you don't know.", "Everybody judges it\u2019s human nature. But thank you for finally answering the question.", ">stop judging people you don't know.\n\nSaid you, judging op for criticizing parent who are shit at parenting their kid and negatively influencing her life.", "NTA but I\u2019d definitely give CPS a call so they can examine the situation\u2026 it\u2019s not normal for a 2 year old to scream and cry throughout the night\u2026", "NTA", "Yta.\n\n\nSimply because you make a wild amount of baseless assumptions based on nothing in order to vilify neighbors you know nothing about\n\n\nTons of reasons for why a kid might be crying and unless you have hearing equipement in their home you dont know what they are doing to attempt calming the child.\n\n\nDogs bark outside of shock collars and vocal cord surgeries training will never eliminate that problem\n\n\nRent a nice remote house if you demand silence. You said its so much cheaper so you can move", "Abusing child abuse lines and service over being annoyed at a crying child is horribly immoral", "I tried to use one of those to drown out my friends snoring on vacation.  Even with the volume all the way up, it didn't work.  Where is that thing anyways?\n\nMy suggestion for now is to line the walls or ceiling that faces the apartment with sound insulation foam.  The kind they use in audio studios.   You could also put down heavy rugs or even more insulation in your bedroom for better sleep.  \n\nMy brother went cheap and used yellow dimpled Mattress foam for a makeshift closet recording studio.    If you're on a budget.   I put up a thick brocade curtain as a wall decoration behind my bed and that dampened the noise next door unintentionally.\n\nIt should help with the screaming (treble) but probably not so much for the running (base) but it's better than going nuts.\n\nYour landlord sucks for allowing that family to move into a 1 bedroom.   My building is mostly 1 bedrooms and he finds lonely single adults who are older and disabled and it works out for the most part , noise wise.  He made an exception for a single mom for the basement 2 bedroom and it was a mistake he regrets to this day. \n\nIt's hard to move and you can suffer and pray someone will come to their senses and they'll move out or block out the noise by putting stuff on the walls.  Earplugs for your whole wall.\n\nThe screaming and barking dynamic isn't  changing anytime soon.\n\nhttps://www.walmart.com/c/kp/acoustics-panels", "Honestly? I'd just start with 'how are you guys doing - everything OK?'. But it's your situation so it's gotta feel right for you.", "OP isn\u2019t forced. He chooses to live there. If the parents are violating noise rules, then OP should report it, then problem is solved", ">OP should report it\n\nThat's where op asks if she's the ah, for reporting the noise."]}
