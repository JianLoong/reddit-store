Seems like they will have to suffer for you and ex's mistakes. As he seems like a deabeat and you just noped out and now they essentially dont get a dad.", "INFO: What's stopping him from doing free stuff with the kids? Like playing games at home, going to a park, etc?\n\nBecause if he literally can't afford things like gas to pick them up, or is in a living situation where they can't visit him at home then my answer is completely different than if he can't afford to take them to the movies or something.\n\nFrom just what you've written, it kind of sounds like you've lost sight of what's best for the kids.", "Of course you're NTA. He's proven that he's not trustworthy, it would be irresponsible to give him more money. I don't really see why he needs money to take your kids out, though - the playground is free. If you want, though, you could send them out with him with a gift card to Starbucks or some other restaurant so that he can feed them without pocketing your cash. But that would be a nice thing to do, *not* something you owe him.", "NTA", "Esh. Deadbeat is Deadbeat sure, but flat out denying your kids time with their dad over money that you don't even need is all about your feelings, not theirs. All you are teaching your kids is that, given the chance, it's better to be bitter and vindictive than kind for the people you love.", "ESH.\n\nI mean i get it, he shouldnt steal and that was very wrong. But you basically used it as a lever now to force him completly out of his kids life. The kids miss him, which means they want to have a relationship with dad. Do not deny them that. Even if you see hin as a deadneat, for the kids, he is dad. \nIf the kids did nit want to see him, it would be different. \n\nThink of a different financial arrangement.", "Some of you are missing the point. If he doesnt pay her the child support she doesnt let him see the kids but she admits to not needing the money.", "YTA. The story above does not convey any of the reasons you would have broken up your family well enough for me to think anything other than \"If OP was concerned about the previous child, she's more than welcome to use her substantial generational wealth to fix that whole child support situation.\"", "Info So just to clarify- if he wanted to exercise his visitation by walking to a park or going to the library or whatever else cheap or free to do would you allow that? You\u2019re saying that he says either you give him $100 to take the kids out or he won\u2019t see them?", "NTA. You haven't blocked his relationship with his kids, you've just stopped giving him handouts.", "NTA - he sounds appalling and the kids would be better off away from the selfish parasite.", "NTA. You wanted your kids to have a dad. But no real parent would steal from or neglect their child. This person did both to his three children.", ">Your kids deserve to see their dad.\n\nTrue, that's why op didn't stopped him even after a year of him not paying. She just refused to give him money because, like you already pointed out, there are many free activities he can do with the kids", "What was OP\u2019s mistake other than being mislead about the type of person she married?", "He wants me to pay him. He says he can't afford anything.", "I never deny him visits. I just stopped giving him money. He is free to see them and take them out.", "Actually, you missed the point. If he doesn't pay child support he loses visitation rights. But I don't enforce it. I am happy he visits. But he refuses to visit if I don't give him money.", "Yeah I\u2019m wondering how the court got that to happen. Child support is to provide a similar living experience at both places. Not my place to wonder about the other kid, but if he knew yeah he\u2019s a dead beat otherwise he could have been surprised. Idk personally if you didn\u2019t trust him afterwards and didn\u2019t want to be with him fine, but straight up taking the kids away is a dick move. If he was a good dad to your kids and then you just straight up rip them from their dad and hold child support in which most cases you would be paying him since you make more than him YTA. I feel like everyone is the asshole and the ones that lose is the kids.", "My partner with holding from me the fact he already has a child, who he never supported in any way,  for 7 years we have been together is reason I divorced him. Trust is important to me.", ">any of the reasons you would have broken up your family\n\nReally? Hiding a kid doesn't seem like a good reason? \n\n>she's more than welcome to use her substantial generational wealth to fix that whole child support situation\n\nWhy? It's not her kid and it's not her responsibility. And what's wrong with having generational wealth??", "His other child (that, again, she didn't know about) is NOT her financial responsibility. Period.", "If he wants to take kids out anywhere, its fine with me.\n\nHe can even spend time at my home with kids, that is okay too.\n\nBut he is refusing to even visit without me paying him.", "Marrying someone she was in a relationship for less then 2 years and being surprised she didnt know everything about past. Finding out something (which to be clear he should of been very upfront about, why i said NTA) and then breaking up marriage after having kids. \n\nEssentially allowing her own poor choices in man to directly affect her children.", "This seems like a lot of your behaviour is rooted in feelings for HIM. Kids deserve dads, end of. ESH. \n\nSource: I was just like your kids once\n\nEdit: like YOUR children didn\u2019t have a deadbeat dad until you made him one to them. You get child support that you admit you don\u2019t need, even though you know he can\u2019t pay it.

You can\u2019t & shouldn\u2019t pay him to be a dad.", "The worst part is OP has had their emotions make a life long decision on the kids behalf using the partners life before the 2 years they were together to restrict the dad. I was a child of a divorced from the age of 6 and my parents hated each others guts but they always agreed on decisions when it came to my best interest I think OP and the Father should come to terms with each other situations ( financial ) and do what\u2019s best for the children. Wether that be you put in more money toward memories for the kids with their father because as you said you have expendable income it doesn\u2019t have to be cash in the fathers hand, maybe book them a day out some where. Cutting the kids off because you think the father needs to get his shit together isn\u2019t the right way about it. \n\nBTW I don\u2019t think you are TA but it\u2019s a sticky situation", "There\u2019s couples who been together much longer and still don\u2019t know every single thing about their partners past, that\u2019s unrealistic. Plus if he was actively hiding it how was she supposed to find out without hiring a detective? \n\nConsidering their oldest kid is 6 and they were only married for 5 years, it\u2019s safe to assume shit happened and they tried to make it work. \n\nWould it be better to stay in a marriage where the trust is broken in such a serious way? \n\nI don\u2019t think being blindsided or not staying married is a mistake on her part", "what I read was he hasn't paid child support in a year and has effectively lost visitation rights and she is still allowing him to see them but he is asking for money to take them out and not really spending that money on them? Correct me if I am wrong?", "So I should pay him money to see his own kids? Not just enough to buy stuff for them, but fund the rest of his life too?", "Yes", "This is EXACTLY it. What\u2019s best for the kids is what is important above all else", "She doesn't stop him for coming to see the kids. She just doesn't pay him anymore.

He can come and take the kids if he wants to spend time with them. Did you even read the post or just jumped right ahead to projecting??"]}
