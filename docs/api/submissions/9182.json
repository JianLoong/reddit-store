We were really broke.\n\nAs soon as I turned 16, I got a job working in retail to contribute to the household and hopefully save up for university. I was starting to save up quite a sizable amount of money after a year.\n\nIn that same year, Dan got one of his coworkers pregnant. Shortly after she gave birth, she was hospitalised multiple times with post-partum psychosis and eventually lost all custody of the baby. \n\nDan took custody and so it was me, our mum, Dan and the baby in a two bedroom flat. It was feeling a bit crowded and cluttered and Dan vented to me many times about how he needs to get his own place.\n\nDan was really struggling for money, he was working a minimum wage job and had all the baby expenses to worry about.\n\nWhen I was 17, Dan stole my debit card and bank details, and withdrew all of my savings, which was around \u00a32K. He put my debit card back in my wallet and then left the house with the baby and moved in with his new girlfriend.\n\nI felt so betrayed that he would just take something that I worked so hard for.\n\nMy mum told me I was forbidden from going to the police about it, and told me to just let it go, as Dan is struggling and needed it. \n\nWhen I was old enough to go to university, my dad gave me money to go towards my expenses.\n\nI hadn't spoken to Dan since that day and Dan never attempted to speak to me either.\n\nLast week my mum tried to sneakily get me and Dan to meet up under the guise that we were just getting a normal dinner at a restaurant and he was in on it. I told them that I don't want to see Dan.\n\nDan told me I need to grow up and I can't hold a grudge over this forever. It was such a long time ago and he was young and desperate, and he's still my brother. He said it's only money and I shouldn't be so materialistic.\n\nI told him it's the principle of it, that I'm his little sister and he stole something significant from me.
