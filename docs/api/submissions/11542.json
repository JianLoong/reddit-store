I come from a family who went to average Unis and I went to a normal public school and then came to America to study. I did the normal dedicated future ivy league student routine throughout high school, everyday extracurriculars, top level athletics, leadership roles, almost perfect grades and SATs and loads of volunteering roles and summer jobs. \n\nMost of my friends also did this, but there\u2019s this one girl in my dorm who is not at all like us. She got 1450 on the SAT and a B+ was her average score, which is very good, but not an ivy league level score. She also didn\u2019t do any extracurriculars apart from being on the junior softball team. She is, however, a triple legacy at this school. This means one of her parents, grandparents, and great grandparents all went here. \n\nRecently, I was talking with my friends about one of my other friends from high school, who sadly didn\u2019t get into an ivy league school, even though he did a lot of the work I did, just lower grades. The legacy girl then walks into the room, joins in the conversation, and immediately starts dissing my friend, saying \u201cwell, not everyone is like us, Ivies nowadays aren\u2019t all about academics, people have to be the perfect human being to get in, like us, we\u2019re the perfect human beings.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t disagree with her on that, but she kept on going, talking about how non Ivy league students are just fundamentally inferior, and it\u2019s not hard to get into an Ivy if you\u2019re good at life. Basically she was dissing pretty much everyone who didn\u2019t get into an Ivy. \n\nI could tell a bunch of us were getting a bit irritated by this, and one of my other friends spoke up, saying that getting into Ivies was ridiculously hard if you are anyone other than the child of a donor or a legacy student. The legacy girl took great offence to that, and spewed some bullshit about how it\u2019s just as hard being a legacy student as it was a normal student. \n\nI told her that yeah, it\u2019s hard to study and stay at this school even as a Legacy, but getting in is infinitely easier, and that all you had to do to tell was look at our high school resumes vs hers. She got furious and said she earned her way here just like us, she was just as good as us, but we all were like \u201csure?\u201d. I left the conversation and later texted her, apologising for calling her out and that we just meant she shouldn\u2019t talk shit about those who didn\u2019t get into these types of schools. \n\nShe did not accept my apology and has now reported me to the Dean\u2019s office, telling me that I should learn not to treat Legacy students like shit, and that it was the same as discrimination. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678009808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11it81d/aita_for_telling_a_girl_that_she_didnt_earn_his/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was notoriously difficult for girls to be offered a place in medical degree courses, and much easy for boys, due to the quotas. The reason being (but never officially admitted) that in case of war there should be enough male medics, who would be automatically mobilised."]}
