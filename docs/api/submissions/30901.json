By adulthood, it's reasonable that someone told her, but she \"always\" knew about an affair that happened when she was two absolutely tells me someone was speaking about topics inappropriate to be brought up in front of her at a young age.", "Ok, NTA then.  From the title it seemed like you only had venom against your step-dad for seducing your innocent mother away from her marriage lol.", "Just being devil\u2019s advocate here.

You have some trauma from your father's death, and lingering anger at both your Mom and Stepfather. While yes, your stepfather is technically the affair partner, it was over two decades ago. That's a long time to be holding on to such strong emotions. \n\nBefore you walk down the aisle yourself, I think you should get into therapy to process those emotions. You don't want to carry them forward in your life or your own marriage.\n\nYou Mom messed up. There is no question about that. But what about the rest of your relationship with her? Was she a good mother in other ways? Did she explain what happened to her marriage with your father? Did you stepfather ever talk about it?

Wouldn\u2019t you want a grandfather figure for them in life?", "My mom is the person who told me that my dad was a bad person because he wouldn't have stayed with her if he was the biological father of my half sister.

Sorry you're dealing with this and I hope she can eventually come around to see your perspective", "I mean, I feel bad for everyone involved, tbh. Except mum and stepdad.

I should know better to ask that question since my dad has a husband.", "That thought hadn't occurred to me and now makes sense!", "It's all good! I know it can be confusing for some people to hear at first.", "Hell no. You're right, it would be insanely disrespectful to your father to have your step-father walk you down the aisle.

Your half-sister is being the AH for pushing an issue with an extremely obvious answer.", "I say NTA, however, I also kinda feel like your aunt is an AH due to airing out grown up shit like that in front of kids.

Your aunt sounds like a real one.", "yeah\u2026 so sister and anyone else who tried to push you into this can shut the fuck up. it is YOUR day, and just because your mom\u2019s affair happened 20+ years ago, it doesn\u2019t make anything about the family your mom and her AP started ok or worth involving in your wedding. shoutout to your aunt for calling your mom on her shit. \nNTA. please stand your ground, OP. and i\u2019m very sorry for the loss of your father. you have done more than enough by being a sister when you never owed that to anyone at all.", "NTA. You told the truth. How she views her father and how you view the man your mom cheated on your dad with, left your dad for, and blew up your family for are two different things.

I worry about all of the anger you seem to have bottled up, or sort of. Obviously your focus now is on your wedding.

You were a child at the time and apparently things were handled poorly. Sounds like your aunt made it way worse with her throwing things in your mom and step dads face at every chance. But to be a full grown adult punishing your parents for a mistake when you were 2 years old... it's time to let go. If they didn't raise you well or were bad parents in other ways, that's different. But you should let go of the resentment over the affair. It is only hurting you.", "You were two when they split up? \n\nAre the memories and feelings of your parent\u2019s split even yours, or just something you learned from your aunt, and then projected onto them after your dad died?\n\nOh, and NTA - you can do whatever you want at your wedding.", "Feels easy: Nobody walks you down the aisle to give you away because you're not a piece of property to be gifted to someone else.

NAH", "You're not the asshole, but I do think you need therapy. You say he tried really hard, and called you his other daughter. The situation was obviously traumatic, and you needed some type of support.

I wouldn't let either of them be at a wedding, in which people vow not to o exactly what your mom did.", "NTA.

If you framed it like \"look. Nobody will ever ever ever replace my dad, so no. Nobody else will walk me down the aisle\"... that I can get behind. It's reasonable,  and fair. But if you actually said \"your dad is just an affair partner\", that is belittling a guy that, as you said yourself, has stepped up to fill the role of father for you, and is very offensive to your half sister. \nIf your intention is to burn the bridges down, ok. Go for it. But be aware it was your choice to do so.", "I mean you don\u2019t owe anyone anything, but kinda you\u2019re punishing your sister for something she didn\u2019t have any control over even if it\u2019s not consciously. That\u2019s the thing that really makes YTA here. NTA for not wanting someone who\u2019s not your dad to walk you down the aisle.

Why did your mum cheat on him?\n\nI ask because you were very young when it happened and so you didn't fully understand the situation. Did you ask your mother?", "Your feelings are perfectly understandable and it is of course up to you who walks you down the aisle.\nHowever...\nYou're holding on to an awful lot of anger and pain which I feel stems from loyalty towards your dad.

Or would he himself have moved on, and want you to do the same?\nMany of the posters here are almost Old Testament in their condemnation of the two 'cheaters'.

Your Aunt is so incredibly toxic, if anyone should be excluded from your wedding it\u2019s her.  I would seriously consider getting use therapy.  \nShit happens in marriages, I find it sad that the man that helped raise and you say loves you, is considered a nobody.  I\u2019m sure the DNA test was requested by your Dad during the divorce. Your step dad \u201cwouldn\u2019t have married her if the baby wasn\u2019t his\u201d  Well that\u2019s pretty obvious, not many men are willing to get married to a woman carrying another guys kid.  \nBut from your post your mind was poisoned by your Aunt.  Extraneous family members should not get involved in a divorce or shoot their mouth\u2019s off to children.  It was never any of her business.  \nMistakes were made long ago, and the wedding guests are 100% your choice.  I hope you and your family can find some healing.

Then mea culpa and f** 'em!\n\nIf not,  maybe reconsider the whole relationship or maybe the way you view the relationship. I had something bit similiar in my family. At some point, I realised that my parents just didn't fit with each other and the relationship ending, even though in a really bad way (cheating), was for the best. \nAnd even though I really wanted to hate both new partners of my parents (and for a long time I did), I at some point realised that they all are just humans. Even worse, I did get along with them and kinda liked them. Don't get me wrong, none of them were ever in any way parental figures for me. But I didn't hate them anymore and accepted them as partners of my parents. \nAdmittedly,  it helped that they all had a strong awareness of not being parental figure's and respected that. \nSometimes you're just with the wrong person, and every ending is better than staying in the relationship. Which obviously doesn't mean cheating is ideal.

At 8 years old there's no way you can know all the facts. From everything you describe he's been there for you and loved you for two decades. So you are relying on one 'fact' that he was your mom's affair partner vs the 20 years of verifiable facts that he treated you well.

There's certainly nothing inherently wrong with your desire or reasoning.

My bio dad cheated and left when I was 2 and let my step-dad adopt me officially when I was 5. I know enough about my mom and my bio dad to know that they weren't ever going to last, and me being born hastened that. \n\nMy step dad then cheats on my mom, same as my bio dad, and I'm mad for years. Then he kills himself, and I'm left hating a dead dude. So a few years goes by, and I get enfianced. We're together for 2 years, and she cheats on me. I'm alone for a good long while, like 8 years. In this time, I did some reflecting and realized I was probably the reason why my fiance cheated on me, not that that makes it ok. This led me to think about my mom's situation through the same lens. Sure enough, there are some glaring similarities. \n\nThis all happened while I was 18-22 years old, and I just started connecting the dots when I was about 30. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that there were definitely factors at play in your bio parents relationship that you don't know about. You need to, very directly, ask your mom to tell you why she cheated on your dad. Let her know how much it bothers you. And don't just assume you know why. You need to hear it from her mouth, in her own words. You may find your dad wasn't everything you thought he was. You may also find that your mother is everything you thought she was.\n\nAs for your step-dad. That man has taken you under his wing and raised you as his own for 26 years, I believe you said, in a world where that is FAR from the norm. He may have helped end your bio parents relationship, but you don't know if that relationship would've lasted in the first place.\n\n And I'm assuming your mother and step-dad have made a happy home, seeing as their relationship has lasted all this time.\n\nAll that being said, you are not an asshole for what you said, given your perspective on the whole situation. However, what you said is a very asshole thing to say to/about someone who has WILLINGLY dedicated half their life to caring for you.\n\nI think you should sit down with your mom and have a serious conversation about your dad. Ask her why she did what she did. Don't assume you know because, unless you have already heard straight from her mouth, all you have is your best guess. You could be right, or you could be wrong.\n\nAs for the wedding, I think you should at least invite them. Or you could go the other direction and alienate some of the only people who have your back just on principle. \n\nPs. Sorry for the novel. There is no TLDR way to say what I was thinking.", "ESH. You have every right to not want him to walk you down the aisle. Girl, walk yourself! You're not property and nobody can \"give you away\" except for yourself. Your actual father included.\n\nThat aside, you could have been nicer about it to your sister. You know it's not her fault. Your step-dad sounds like he's trying so that's nice. Your mother is the one responsible for the affair altogether. She was married and she should have been the one to stop things before they escalated. She should have at least explored other options in regard to ending her marriage before moving on to someone else. She didn't do that. This guy definitely contributed to her infidelity but ultimately mom was the one that for sure knew she was married to someone at the time things got serious with him.\n\nYou sister shouldn't have just assumed who, if anyone, would be walking you down the aisle.
