It\u2019s YOUR day", "\\> they won't be invited\n\nif that's the case, why even bother with this thread? :)\n\nNTA", "Oh, ok. Well, I guess I can understand why your sister thinks you hate them, lol. But It's your decision whether you have a relationship with them or not, and I know how confusing family conflicts like this can be. You aren't TA in this case, but it sounds like your relationship with your sister might be suffering if she feels this way. \n\n\nI'm kinda surprised your sister assumed he was going to be a part of the wedding at all if you don't see each other on a semi-regular basis", "I\u2019m not saying you never should\u2019ve known but your dad died when you were not even 8. You should not have been involved in any of the adult drama at such a young age. And for her to repeatedly bring it up in front of either of you isn\u2019t ok.", "I have no relationship with him and my mom anymore. They won't be invited to my wedding. They are not part of my life except for very rare things and even then it's not because I attend their stuff or they get invited to mine. I am civil. But we will never be a family. My dad hated him too. That is enough for me. I will not betray my dad like that or myself.", "Why not, if she\u2019s going to continually try and sanctify the guy that ruined OP\u2019s and her dad\u2019s life then it\u2019s only fair she gets a dose of the truth.  Yes her mom is also to blame but just because he stuck around after blowing up her life doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a great guy.", "Sorry, no, it's not appropriate to air your third-party opinions about the conflict between someone, their ex who is their child's father, and the child's new step-parent in front of that child. Children should not be put in the middle of problems like this. By adulthood, it's reasonable that someone told her, but she \"always\" knew about an affair that happened when she was two absolutely tells me someone was speaking about topics inappropriate to be brought up in front of her at a young age.", "Ok, NTA then.  From the title it seemed like you only had venom against your step-dad for seducing your innocent mother away from her marriage lol.", "Just being devil\u2019s advocate here. Did your step dad know about your mum being married as he put his rod in her?", "Because of how things went with my sister. That's the only reason there is any guilt on my part.", "She has this idea that we can all be one family sometime. But that is not an option. She holds onto the idea that her dad is also my dad. That's why she assumed all this.", "Props to you for being civil with them and staying true to how you feel about your father. NTA", "Dear OP, you are your own person with the right to make that choice. But you seem angry and hurt on behalf of your Dad, about an affair that had nothing to do with you. Who knows what happened in their marriage. None of this should have been put on your by any of the adults in your life. \n\nPlease, before you get married, get into therapy and work through these experiences with your family. And tell your Aunt you've heard enough.", "This is so toxic and unhealthy.", "Sounds like sister has been hearing \"the truth\" for 25 years", "Because it's not her fault and this would be unnecessarily aggressive and cause more problems. I would refrain from encouraging people to act destructively if I were you and reflect on why you think it's appropriate to talk to people close to you that way.", "It's Reddit and cheaters must be punished! /s.\n\nSeriously the aunt doesn't need to 'call out' her sister at 'every opportunity' to the point that it clearly fucked up OP and OPs mother's relationship.", "He knew she was married and that she had a kid.", "No guilt. It was a low blow to say her father was around longer than your dad. Your wedding, your choice. Step-sister needs to butt out.", "OP, I think this is beyond an AH assessment. You have some trauma from your father's death, and lingering anger at both your Mom and Stepfather. While yes, your stepfather is technically the affair partner, it was over two decades ago. That's a long time to be holding on to such strong emotions. \n\nBefore you walk down the aisle yourself, I think you should get into therapy to process those emotions. You don't want to carry them forward in your life or your own marriage.\n\nYou Mom messed up. There is no question about that. But what about the rest of your relationship with her? Was she a good mother in other ways? Did she explain what happened to her marriage with your father? Did you stepfather ever talk about it? What caused you to have no relationship with your Mom as you got older?\n\nYou don't have to forgive your Mom, but you do need to make peace with what she did, take a step back, and let some of this go -- do this for your own well-being. Recognize that good people can in fact mess up. \n\nIf you have a relationship with your sister, she does not want to keep hearing her Dad referred to as her mother's affair partner. She didn't do anything to deserve that, so enough. She's heard you loud and clear. A simple \"I prefer walking down the aisle alone or with my uncle so and so. I know you love your Dad, but the relationship is different for me. I hope you can respect that.\"", "It's not just on behalf of my dad, but me too.", "Yet is still trying to preach to the victim.\n\nBoth OP and Half-Sis are innocent but she needs to understand that OP will never consider forgiving them for what they did and accept it.", "It\u2019s not OPs fault either, but HS is aware of OPs views and still continues to attempt to insert her father into OPs life when OP wants nothing to do with him. It is up to OP who she forgives and associates with no-one else.", "My mom fucked our relationship up herself. A lot more happened with her than me knowing about the affair.", "Ok so still your issue lies with both your step dad and more importantly your mum. \n\nHave you ever confronted her about it, or even explained to her why you don\u2019t feel comfortable with him walking you down the aisle.\n\nWhat if you have kids. Wouldn\u2019t you want a grandfather figure for them in life?", "My mom is the person who told me that my dad was a bad person because he wouldn't have stayed with her if he was the biological father of my half sister. She praised her husband for marrying her when he found out he was but thought my dad was terrible for making it clear they would get divorced whether he was raising one kid or two.\n\nShe tried to \"cheer me up\" when dad died by suggesting her husband meant I wasn't going to miss out on having a dad.\n\nShe also called her husband my dad and when I corrected her she would get really annoyed with me. Then she said my dad was shitty for DNA testing me after he found out about the affair, which to make makes perfect sense.", "Nah she can call him whatever she likes", "I don't think OP actually wants to hurt her sister, considering the only reason OP's posting is because she feels bad that her decision upset her. Sister was a victim of these adults' acts and vitriol, too \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And if that is the case, it's time to let go of the anger and start fresh. It's done. Now focus on yourself and not being burdened by your history.", "That's completely fair. I'm sorry your relationship got messed up in that way. Again I don't think you're wrong for any of your actions. \n\nI get why you're doing what you're doing.", "I have confronted her about it in the past. We no longer talk now though (my choice).\n\nNope. My kids really won't know either of them. My future kids will have two amazing grandfathers in my two future FILs.", "I really didn't. She didn't have a say on any of this and I know that. None of this was ever meant to hurt her. When she said \"our father\" I admit I was triggered because that man is not my father and never will be.", "This is true but Sister knows that her constant parading of her father WILL hurt OP. She can\u2019t have it both ways.", "Two future FIL's?  I don't understand this, can you please clarify?  I thought your father died?\n\nEDIT:  Please ignore that last sentence.  I'm being stupid.", "Yeah. This is a dark cloud over what should be an exciting time of planning your wedding. Sorry you're dealing with this and I hope she can eventually come around to see your perspective", "I mean, I feel bad for everyone involved, tbh. Except mum and stepdad. I just thought your suggestion sounds like adding fuel to a fire that's burning really well without any additional anger on OP's part. I agree sister is being unreasonable in her expectation, and I'm glad OP knows that and isn't second guessing her choice", "My fiance has two dads!", "Her future spouse may have two dads.", "Yep, makes sense now.  I should know better to ask that question since my dad has a husband.", "That thought hadn't occurred to me and now makes sense!", "It's all good! I know it can be confusing for some people to hear at first."]}
