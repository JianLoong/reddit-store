I found her name, website, and IG in under 3 minutes.", "So you moved away? After you broke up? I\u2019m super confused, but was basically trying to figure out if she was wanting the dog when she didn\u2019t even have a stable residence. It also sounds like the dog is already used to living in the city?", "That is a VERY cute dog. I would like to throw my hat in the ring for dog custody.", "Who is the dog closest to?", "Bro does your ex gf use Reddit?", "Haha\u2026 you might want to delete yours as well. I didn\u2019t even think of looking until your comment. I won\u2019t say either but the dog is even on there to confirm it lmao", "Lol what kind of detective skills do you have bro?? xD", "OP, all it took was a couple google searches. I'm pretty sure I have the names of all three players involved. Former clarinetist so I was curious. LOL.", "Hard to say, probably equal. I rough housed with it a bunch but partner was the \u201cloving\u201d partner", "I didn\u2019t think so\u2026 but reading above\u2026 maybe", "Lol, yes, I was like maybe? Then I saw the dog.", "The person above you is right. I was able to find her really easy with one Google search and then another of her public Instagram to confirm.", "It took me a single google search.  There is only one first harp for the Minneapolis orchestra who\u2019s about 30 went to Juilliard and has an adorable white/brown husky.", "(If I have the correct oboist), OP is way cuter than the oboe player smh. Harpist has bad taste.", "Burn her reputation to the ground", "I must be really bad with this then lol, but yeah recommend OP hides it.", "I honestly didn't expect it to be that easy. But I guess there are not a ton of julliard educated harpest playing in the Minneapolis orchestra. Keep at it your Google fu will get there!"]}
