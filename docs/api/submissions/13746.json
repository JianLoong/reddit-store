Yes, I had her young, as I and my gf messed up.  My gf didn't want to take care of Deliah, which is whatever and I cannot change that. So I'm basically a single dad. I love Deliah, she is my life. She means everything to me, and I'd give a life and take a life for my baby. That's how much I love her. She's my world.\n\nWhen i informed my mom & dad that i had a daughter and i introduced my baby girl to my parents. , my dad's first move was to run upstairs and barge in my room grab all my stuff and go to the door and throw it out on the ground, he then pointed outside and yelled, and snapped his finger \"GET OUT RIGHT NOW!\" my mom was crying telling my dad \"no let him stay let him stay, we finally have some good news, etc\" and my mom was happy about my daughter as the last few years in our family, was not good. So announcing a new family member on the way brought a smile to my mom.\n\nMy dad put all my belongings outside, while I held Deliah on my shoulder. I grabbed my stuff and left. I then walked to my local motel holding Deliah and we stayed there for a few days, till i figured out what i need to do and everything. It was rough. I didn't have enough money, and I had a daughter but I knew that i have to give my baby girl a good life regardless. I called my best friend \"Deandre\" who then gave my number to \"John\" and a lady named \"Janice\" who runs a daycare at her house which was super cheap so i could drop deliah off before work\n\nJohn owns a small warehouse. He offered me a job for $14/hr and he hooked me up with one of his connections to offer me a small studio apartment for cheap. So the baby was taken care of at daycare, and i got a job. I worked daily, and using the money i had after taking care of Deliah, the bills, etc. I started saving it up and whatever i saved i started a business. I started an e-commerce arbitrage-based business which took a lot of work and months. A lot of time, and money was lost but i eventually succeeded and my life changed completely. Moved into a new apartment, bought a car, got the best for my baby, and changed my lifestyle. Now i'm living good, i get to work from home. Take care of my daughter and life is amazing.\n\nI recently invited mom to my new home to see her granddaughter, and she was excited and came over instantly i open the door and it's my dad with mom. I ignore dad, and let my mom meet deliah and hold her. dad wanted to hold her and i said no. Don't touch my daughter. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Some are asking how did i afford a house, and how am i a millionaire. First off, lmao. Some of you need to read this completely. I don't have a house. I moved into a new apartment, and i am not a millionaire lol. Far from a millionaire. I don't know where y'all are getting the fact i said i became a millionaire and that i have a house and all. I said i moved into a new apartment.
