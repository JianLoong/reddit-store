Yes, I had her young, as I and my gf messed up.  My gf didn't want to take care of Deliah, which is whatever and I cannot change that. So I'm basically a single dad. I love Deliah, she is my life. She means everything to me, and I'd give a life and take a life for my baby. That's how much I love her. She's my world.\n\nWhen i informed my mom & dad that i had a daughter and i introduced my baby girl to my parents. , my dad's first move was to run upstairs and barge in my room grab all my stuff and go to the door and throw it out on the ground, he then pointed outside and yelled, and snapped his finger \"GET OUT RIGHT NOW!\" my mom was crying telling my dad \"no let him stay let him stay, we finally have some good news, etc\" and my mom was happy about my daughter as the last few years in our family, was not good. So announcing a new family member on the way brought a smile to my mom.\n\nMy dad put all my belongings outside, while I held Deliah on my shoulder. I grabbed my stuff and left. I then walked to my local motel holding Deliah and we stayed there for a few days, till i figured out what i need to do and everything. It was rough. I didn't have enough money, and I had a daughter but I knew that i have to give my baby girl a good life regardless. I called my best friend \"Deandre\" who then gave my number to \"John\" and a lady named \"Janice\" who runs a daycare at her house which was super cheap so i could drop deliah off before work\n\nJohn owns a small warehouse. He offered me a job for $14/hr and he hooked me up with one of his connections to offer me a small studio apartment for cheap. So the baby was taken care of at daycare, and i got a job. I worked daily, and using the money i had after taking care of Deliah, the bills, etc. I started saving it up and whatever i saved i started a business. I started an e-commerce arbitrage-based business which took a lot of work and months. A lot of time, and money was lost but i eventually succeeded and my life changed completely. Moved into a new apartment, bought a car, got the best for my baby, and changed my lifestyle. Now i'm living good, i get to work from home. Take care of my daughter and life is amazing. \n\nI recently invited mom to my new home to see her granddaughter, and she was excited and came over instantly i open the door and it's my dad with mom. I ignore dad, and let my mom meet deliah and hold her. dad wanted to hold her and i said no. Don't touch my daughter.

I'm sure your relationship is severely damaged and I'm not saying to just forget what he did, but if you can reach a point where you can be cordial around each other it may be worth it.

I meant an apartment if you want to know what type of apartment. It was $500/a month in a not-so-good area. So that explains it. \n\nNumber two, regarding diapers and baby supplies. It wasn't the best supplies and all. I'll agree with that, but i got them for either free or cheap. From food banks, etc. \n\nHolding a full-time job wasn't that hard ben. It really wasn't. When you have a kid, you'll make things work, somehow someway. When you are in that situation. When i'd wake up in the morning. I'd get deliah ready and walk her to the daycare and drop her off and go to the warehouse to work. Then when my shift was over, i'd walk to the daycare to grab deliah and go home. \n\nWhen i'd go home, i'd feed Deliah and put her to sleep and I'd open my laptop and work.

Honestly having deliah in my life is a blessing. I believe she was the one who made me the person who i am today, without her.

Otherwise, when Delilah was first born, she was staying at her mom's place for a while. Then when the time felt right which was when my post comes in. Then I announced it and all.\n\n2) I didn't have any of her baby stuff my parents house to begin with, all of the baby stuff including carrier, etc was at deliah's mom's place.", "You have a point, honestly, i do want to forgive him and all. But it's like. You kicked me out at my worst point in my life?  I had a baby, and you had a grand daughter and you kicked her out too. \n\nThat kind of hurt me the most, it wasn't about me but my baby deliah. You didn't even want to say hi, or acknowledge her and ur first move was to kick your son out while he's holding his baby. Feels sad.", "Hahahahahaha.\n\nSorry guy you making a fool of yourself. \n\n14 an hour at 8 hours a day then you're working nearly a week only for your rent, which was 500 a week. Childcare a cheap one takes like 300 per week thats another 2,5 weeks payment gone. And then you've not bought ANYTHING for the kid yet. \n\nA doctors visit for lets say your daughter has a rash or ear infection what does that cost? Plus medication. But of course you have a health insurance that covers that all, right? So no extra spendings on that. Or wonderbaby never gets sick.... \n\nAnd then you forget THE most important thing. 8 hours you're working, get home which may take some time. Unless you don't live next your working spot and daycare is not next to your apartment and next to working spot you need to calculate some time for getting home and pick up kid from daycare. Then quickly feed kiddo. But with what? You forgot shopping. \n\nOK never mind you don't shop you go to food bank and they do home deliveries. Thats The new thing with them. So after feeding you directly put baby to sleep and yeah she's wonderbaby she sleeps right away. Never sick, never moody, no sleepless nights for you and her. \n\nThen when she's sound asleep and remains asleep miraculously for the rest of the night you open laptop and work. \n\nBut who does laundry, who does dishes, who cleans your place, who gets rid of the mess people generate when living their live? Get and organize new clothes? You need to get constantly new clothes in the first year for kids. Meaning you also need to sort out old clothes which are too small and put them away. Bottles you need to clean and desinfect them, like constantly. Who does that because you sit on your laptop. When do you do that all when you start working as soon as wonderbaby is asleep. And do you ever interact with that kid? Like play? Go for walks? To the park? See doctors? Visit friends (your or hers doesn't matter)? Do you know how much time all that eats? Especially if you do that all alone? \n\nAs I said I have a job. And someone staying home with the kids, my husband. I know what it means to hold a job and to have kids. I know what it means to live of off a budget and I an happy that that was BEFORE I had kids. \n\nThe worst hole in your story is that you talk about me me me me but never about your wonderbaby that you love more than everything. \n\nYou seem to have no idea what living with a baby is like because then you knew what I was talking of. It's not about holding a job. I've been holding my job for very many years now. Thats not so difficult if you're not an idiot. Finding that job that pays good and is at a stable company is difficult. Manage kids and job at once is difficult. Surviving the sleepless nights and still get up in the morning is difficult. Get all the chores done is difficult. \n\nYour telling stories.", "OP is telling stories. How did he become a millionaire such that he could afford a house AND car within a year while also paying rent, essentials, day care AND taking care of Deliah as a single dad. \n\nPlease downvote his post it\u2019s so bait", "She's close to 2 years old now. And she can walk/talk.", "I get 100% where you're coming from.  I haven't had contact with my dad in close to ten years.  Not going into the reasons why but I wish it didn't have to be that way.  My parents aren't together so my relationship with my mom isn't affected but it makes things awkward with other people in my family at times.  I tried, and I think he did too, to remedy the situation but unfortunately we just couldn't make a relationship between us work.  I don't get all the people on Reddit that seem so caviler about cutting people out of your life and making it seem like an easy thing to do.  It sucks, even if sometimes it's the right thing to do.\n\nI really hope you two can somehow get past what happened and your daughter will know her grandpa.  That is one of the hardest things I had to deal with, when my kids asked why they didn't ever see their grandpa.", "Legit. I thought I was going crazy when I read his story and thought none of the maths made ANY sense.", "I prefer OP's made up story to this load of self drivel.", "I didn't read it as he bought the new apartment but moved into a better rental"]}
