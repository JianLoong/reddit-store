If your husband has a hard time understanding this, invite your mother to his next prostate exam.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  It\u2019s a medical procedure, not a side-show.  The procedure is done on you.  You tell everyone else what you need.  Your comfort, privacy and safety come first. SMH", "Tell that man of yours that when he has a baby he can decide who's with you when you deliver. No one should even ask if they can be in there. This is not a spectator event. And if he pushes it you can remind him that you can make sure he's not in there either. Use your power, honey.", "NTA, but you can only control the room.  She can enter the hospital.

EW.\n  \n\nThis doesn't even need discussion.   There is not choice by anyone else, not even husband.   Only You.", "NTA. you are pretty far ahead of yourselves. But I wish you luck. You're right, and within your rights, to assert even at this early stage that you wouldn't want his mother in the delivery room. You don't need to cite your less than ideal relationship with her, though. That's beside the point. It's atypical to have more than two people there. He doesn't seem to get it. Why don't you compromise and allow her to be at the hospital and see the baby shortly after they're born?", "I\u2019m a MIL and I would never expect my DIL to invite me into her delivery room. Delivering a baby is difficult and stressful and the mother should have total control over who is in the room with her. I have a great relationship with my DIL and, when the time comes, I will let her know she has my support for whatever she needs.\n\nEdited to add: NTA\n\nWhen the husband pushes the baby out he can choose who he wants to support them.", "NTA - when he pushes the baby out of his body then his mom can be there. Otherwise\u2026no! If he continues to push for it I\u2019d ban him from the delivery room as well. Labor is an intensive emotional roller coaster. You don\u2019t want anything but positive vibes in that room with you.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou are the one given birth and you are the only one who has a say who can be in the room when you are at your most vulnerable.\nBTW, does your hospital have a limit on the number of people who can be in the room?", "NTA. You are the one giving birth and you and only you get the final say as to who is in the delivery room with you. If your MIL is only going to add stress and isn\u2019t going to help you relax, then there is no reason for her to be there. This is a very personal and vulnerable moment for you and she isn\u2019t entitled to be there.", "NTA, it's an extremely, extremely personal moment in your life and also it's a medically fraught time that can be really dangerous for mothers. Best of luck OP, you are NTA.\n\nYou're the one squeezing a human out of your vagina, YOU get to decide who is there in the delivery room.", "Nta, I would have him watch labor videos and ask him would he want your mom there to watch him if he was the one giving birth? Also what does she offer to you, the person giving birth? If she doesn\u2019t offer anything then they are an unnecessary person in the room.", "NTA  just tell the MIL no and if your guy pushes back tell him not to come also.", "NTA. Ask him if he'd mind your mom going and watching him have a back sack and crack followed by several prostate exams and finally a therapy session resulting in him showing his most vulnerable side. When it's his body exposed and he's at his most vulnerable he's welcome to make choices about who's present. But he has absolutely NO say in who's there when you're at your most exposed and vulnerable.\n\n\nEdit: and there's a high risk aspect to the birth! Your comfort and a calm environment should be the number one priority anyway but even more so with it being high risk! NO MIL. He needs to understand it's not about him and his family it's about you. (And your mom is there to support YOU her daughter and provide comfort/reassurance etc, not to meet her grandchild first) He needs to see it more as YOU giving birth rather than his mom's grandchild being born. You can't put being vulnerable on hold, whereas his mom can wait and celebrate her grandchild's birth later when you're not at your absolute most vulnerable.", " NTA. A lot of people don\u2019t realize that childbirth is an invasive medical procedure and you only want certain people to see you in that condition. You seem to be ok with your MIL meeting the baby after the birth so you should probably emphasize that point so it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re not suggesting that one grandma is more important than the other.", "NTA. The birth process is typically long, difficult, and excruciatingly painful, and from what I hear, can be very scary, especially for a first time! The people who are there should be people who are comforting for you to be around, since you\u2019re the one delivering. I understand his wanting his mom there, but he\u2019s not the one pregnant and he won\u2019t be the one delivering the baby, so ultimately who is in the room isn\u2019t up to him. If he knows your relationship with MIL isn\u2019t good, he should drop it and let you choose who is best for YOU as you go through the birthing process. She can come in after to see the new baby. Congrats btw!", "YWNBTA. I had my exh and my mom in the delivery room with me during the actual birth. My exMIL was also pissed. But, ultimately, YOU are the one with the huge monumental PHYSICAL task to do. Everything should be about making you feel more comfortable and supported.", "NTA\n\nYou will be having a medical procedure. She stresses you out, which can cause problems with labor. After birth, you need to bond with baby and recover. She can wait until you are home and ready for a visit. \n\nPlus, will hospital even allow more than two? Since 2020, they have limited visitors. Now that flu and RSV are picking back up, they are back to strictly limiting visitors. \n\nIf she does come up, just ask her to leave or have nurses remove her from room if she is interfering or causing issues.", "NTA.  Those are your private parts, your pain and your bodily fluids exposed. Thus your comfort comes first. MIL can come in, after you are cleaned up. \n\nPerhaps let her take the first pictures as a compromise? Or ask her to make the announcement on social media? If you like her and for the sake of your husband I would give her something special.", "NTA. This is your decision alone. Nobody else gets a say.", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t about fair. Your mom will be there to support her child through labor. His mom will be there to see the show. You can\u2019t even compare the two.\n\nAlthough, if you aren\u2019t even pregnant and his main priority with your delivery is his mommy. You should get him to some marital counseling before you consider making a baby with him.", "NTA your medicinal procedure is not a spectator sport.", "NTA. You and only you decide who\u2019s in the hospital room with you.", "No as a grandmother I promise I come to the hospital only on invitation. That\u2019s so intrusive.", "Once again:\n\n**Child birth is not a spectator sport. It is a medical procedure, that is high risk and life threatening even after the smoothest of pregnancies. Only the mother, the patient in this scenario, gets to decide who is in the room.**\n\nAsk him when he's getting on the bed, naked, legs akimbo, with you, his mother and your mother present, to look at his junk, for hours? Days? \n\nNTA.", "Tell him you don\u2019t want his mom to see your hooha", "Nta. You get 100% decision making power about who gets to be in the delivery room (as long as the number of people is agreed upon by the doc). Don\u2019t let anyone else tell you different. Period.", "NTA. Giving birth is not a spectator sport. You, and you alone, choose who gets in.", "Lol wtf? Does he think that because it\u2019s his child he gets a say on your body???? \n\nFuck that entitlement and its mom too \ud83d\ude02.\n\nNTA. You\u2019re the one going through the most traumatic thing the female body goes through. He gets no say whatsoever.", "NTA. No one gets ANY say in who is in the room but the person giving birth. This is a giant red flag for your fiance.", "NTA\n\nLike it's been said forever, giving birth isn't a spectator sport. It's a high risk medical procedure, and YOU are the patient. The people allowed to the delivery room are the ones who YOU are comfortable with. Your fianc\u00e9 doesn't get a vote or say.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a medical procedure at the end of the day, and you are being subjected to it. It's high in pain, exhaustion and emotions. You are the main event so to speak. In this case, you are the priority. Afterwards It's you and the baby, not just the baby. You need to be comfortable with whoever is there.", "NTA - I see your husband\u2019s point but you giving birth trumps whatever else other people want. You call the shots. If he ends up bringing his mother anyway, then you\u2019re within your rights to tell the staff to kick her out and they will be happy to do so. She\u2019s more than welcome to wait in the waiting area, instead. With a high risk pregnancy, you\u2019ll have staff - nurses, doctors, etc - coming into your room to fuss over you and the baby. No need for extra people getting under foot.", "I'm a man and am pretending not to understand your question.\n\nYour birth your choice.\n\nYou have the people in the room you want, assuming they are willing to be there.\n\nMILs are rarely in the birthing room. It is unusual for the women to be so close to the MIL she wants here there. She can have a great MIL whom she loves whom she doesn't want there.", "Nta. You are the one undergoing a medical procedure when delivering the baby and its your body on display. Once the baby is born, he doesn't get equal say on who gets to come visit the child, but during the actual delivery, nope you get 100% say in who is in the room with you.", "I\u2019m not sure where you live, but I\u2019m in the states (California) and last year when I gave birth, I was only allowed one person. Initially it was two people, but Bc of COVID, it was brought down to one. And in any case that they do allow more people, it\u2019s just strange they should feel she has the right to be there. You\u2019re going to be very exposed and vulnerable and only those you absolutely trust and feel comfortable should be there. To force you to accept anyone else in there seems like an invasion of privacy. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand men who want their MIL at the birth. Would these same men be comfortable if you walked around naked in front of their mothers because they will see a lot more of you at the birth.", "NTA, tell him when he gives birth you fully support him choosing whomever he wants in the delivery room with him.", "NTA.\n\nHave we recognized that the MIL trying to be in the delivery room or the SO trying to push, for that, is a red flag, yet?\n\nI've seen so many of these posts and it always ends, badly...", "NTA. Be calm, kind, but firm. You want her to be part of the baby\u2019s life but not your medical procedure. Your mom isn\u2019t there as a grandmother. She\u2019s there as the person who has comforted you for literally your entire life. She\u2019s there to provide you comfort and strength.\n\nSince he\u2019s taking about it early, I think it\u2019s important not to dismiss it and let him think you\u2019ll change your mind or tell his mom she should expect to be there. It doesn\u2019t need to be a fight, you just need to be clear about what you want but acknowledge you know he might be disappointed.", "I REALLY don\u2019t understand the obsession of people wanting to force themselves into other peoples delivery rooms? What\u2019s wrong with them? Is it an American MIL-thing? SO strange. \n\n\nAs someone who\u2019s recently given birth, it\u2019s a firm NO to ANYONE that makes you uncomfortable. You have to set this boundary HARD with your fianc\u00e9. Yes, it\u2019s his baby too but it is YOUR body. And it will be exposed in a way you\u2019ve never experienced before. \n\nEven if it\u2019s a smooth birth, you will be in a very exposed situation. A lot of things happens during birth and you should not have to focus on ANYTHING other than the procedure. Sit him down and have a serious talk with him. First about the fact that your (and the babys) comfort is priority number one - your MIL is not giving birth, hence her opinion/feelings/whatever DOSEN\u2019T count! \n\nSecond, a co-partner during childbirth should be prepared to do HARD work. Not only snivel in a corner and pat your hand. Hubby and I took a course in profylax (have to check translation, we\u2019re not English speaking) where one of the major focuses was to give me pain-relief through putting pressure on certain points on my body (knees, shoulders etc). He spent all my time in labour (both times!) exercising that pressure to help me. Hours. Will your MIL be able to do that? \n\nAlso, if she\u2019s conservative and of a certain age she WILL gossip about your birth. \u201cOP didn\u2019t do this, OP didn\u2019t do that\u201d and you don\u2019t need that judgemental c**p in your life. \n\nShow your baby daddy these comments and ask him once again about his opinion.", "NTA. I have a great relationship with my MIL and even I don't want her there with me when I give birth. Birth is an incredibly powerful moment, but it's also incredibly risky, and a very vulnerable moment for the person giving birth.\n\nThe only people there should be people you want there that will respect and help you through birth in the best way possible for you. People you are 100% comfortable being that vulnerable around.\n\nPerhaps she can see baby afterwards as a compromise - if you end up feeling up for the visit in the hospital. If not, that's completely ok too. \n\n(As a side note, my mom had her mom and her MIL in the room when she had me, but she knew her MIL from the time she was 14 and was completely comfortable with her being there, but their relationship is completely different from the one you have with your MIL)", "NTA.

Very personal experience", "NTA it your body and it a  risky situation you have e every right for your mum there and not his", "NTA. Stop viewing it as the birth of a grandchild. Start viewing it as YOUR delivery. It\u2019s your hospital stay. YOU are the patient. The baby will have YOUR name until you sign a birth certificate. Everything about YOUR delivery is about YOUR needs. Nobody is entitled to be present in YOUR hospital room. Don\u2019t give up on this topic. You need to be as comfortable and stress free as possible. Make sure your partner knows you have know problem asking the nurses to escort anyone out of the room if they are causing you stress. Your priority is to stay calm because a raise in your blood pressure and too fast of breathing means a drop in babies blood pressure.", "What is up with these damn 'mama's boys on here....I couldn't imagine asking my wife if my mom could come into the delivery room. These young idiot fathers really think it's some tit for tat. I can't even blame age because I know plenty of young men, 25 and under, who wouldn't even dream of this. It's totally up to mom, but personally I think it's bad form to even ask. Don't even put her in that tough spot. NTA", "NTA. This is not about anyone but you! \n\nI am 36 weeks pregnant and I made it VERY clear from the beginning that I only wanted my husband there. My mom is even an L&D nurse and I think she was a bit hurt but I stood my ground (she\u2019s better about it now).

It was beautiful, private and mine to choose.", "NTA for not wanting MIL in delivery room.
