If you don't know the person and haven't even met them, it's very hard to view them as family. I think you should be supportive if Tim's happy, so go to the wedding and meet his new wife and children, and just show Tim that you are there for him. But you shouldn't have to feel bad about not viewing a stranger as a family member.", "NTA.  Just because you marry someone, doesn\u2019t mean that the immediately become proper family particularly if you don\u2019t introduce them!  Difficult to be an instant Grand parent to someone you have never even seen.", "NTA.\n\nYour son needs to stop expecting all of you to get along with his new family in short span of time irrespective of what they mean to him. It's hard for people to bond and telling people it's the first wedding also doesn't sound right, he is trying too hard to make his new family fit into yours.", "NTA. You\u2019ve never met them and aren\u2019t related to them. Tim should stop trying to push his own narrative.", "NTA. Tim is rushing his (step) family immediately in your family\u2019s lives, when it takes a while (long time even) to get close with people. You only knew of Sammy for *two* weeks- and whether you want to be technical or not, you at the moment don\u2019t feel connected enough to feel like they are \u201cgrandchildren\u201d to you.\n\nI can understand Tim\u2019s excitement, but he needs to slow down. There have been other posts about family rushing people in their family like this, when clearly the family is rightfully not 100% ready. You expressed your feelings about it, and he should respect that.", "NTA", "NTA, You can't force anyone to accept a stranger as family. That takes time and it may still be the case that the grandchildren you have seen growing up, continue to feel more like family.", "You are NTA. Sammy is not your grandchild. That's absurd. End of story.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s highly unlikely that Sammy sees Tim as family or a parental figure because they met at most 3 months ago! It\u2019s different when the parents marry when kids are adults. \n\nYou have to question the judgement of someone who merges two large families with kids in such a short time. You aren\u2019t even supposed to let your new partner meet your kids until about 6 months and Tim has moved a family of 7 in with his 4 kids at 3 months??\n\nPlease do your best to check in on Tim\u2019s bio kids. Are they really okay with all this change so quickly? Where are they all staying? Does Tim or Jane have a house big enough to house 12??", "Tim seems to be TA here, not you!", "NTA.

So the first grandchild thing is an odd thing to tell the whole family because they won't be invited. \n\nYour not refusing to build a relationship with her or trying to be hurtful or unkind. So your 100% NTA for trying to bring your son back to reality.", "NTA. And there is a high probability that Sammy is rolling her eyes at her mom\u2019s fast marriage and the forced parent/grandparent language.", "NTA and surely Sammy doesn\u2019t see you as a grandparent either. You are complete strangers. Weird that Tim would refer to an adult that you\u2019ve never met as your grandchild. He\u2019s only known her mother for three months!", "Ehhh I\u2019m going to go with light ESH\n\nThis is all just over the title of \u201cfirst grandchild married\u201d. Tim and Sammy aren\u2019t really asking you to do anything or take ownership/ responsibility as you say, its just the title. \n\nIf Jack and Noah cared I could see why you\u2019d want to defend them, but you say they don\u2019t. \n\nThe phone call wasn\u2019t really necessary here, and you\u2019re right that the consequence is going to be a rift in the family before you\u2019ve even met them.\n\nBut you\u2019re not wrong, is the thing. You can\u2019t really be a grandparent to someone you\u2019ve never met. \n\nI think they\u2019re a little ridiculous and getting ahead of themselves by claiming the title and for making it up in the first place. It\u2019s not a competition to see who gets married first.\n\nOverall they suck for creating this whole \u201ctitle\u201d mess. It stupid, but seeing as none of the grandkids are bothered by it then this would have been best just to let go.", "NTA. You really don\u2019t know any of these folks. Human emotions don\u2019t work like that. I suspect they want to shore up all the positive family vibes ASAP after the elopement, being a jerk to you six weeks after eloping with a stranger with six kids won\u2019t be the way to do that. I would take Jack and Noah\u2019s lead though. See what happens there across the country with the new sudden marriage and the ten kids before you get too involved, it sounds like a mess waiting to happen. He may need you shortly.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHy are you causing drama over this? You sure are an AH out to hurt people.", "Why does what he says matter to you? It doesn't sound like he's asking you to do or say anything, contribute to her wedding, take a special role, etc. Yeah, it's weird and uncomfortable, but your reaction was over the top and probably will cause some problems in your relationship, so ESH.", "NTA. Your feelings are reasonable and valid - and just as important as anyone else's in that particular conversation about grandkids. \n\nHowever I would tread carefully to not push Tim away. The rushed marriage is likely unwise, it's very possible it won't last, and the fallout could be huge. He will need your support if so.", "NTA \n\nMy dad got remarried when I was in my 20s.  It was 3 months before my brothers long awaited wedding that we were all thrilled about.  We weren\u2019t sure who my dad was dating at the time even though we all saw each other several times a month.  I felt very uncomfortable with the titles he and his new wife aggressively pushed during my brothers wedding festivities.  Her family was perfectly polite but I just didn\u2019t know them.  Your new step grand daughter might feel the same way as you.  I think it\u2019s great that you plan to make time to get to know them.", "You are not wrong. She is not you grandchild.", "NTA.  But with how fast this thing seems to have happened, I'd be worried about the actual grandkids, you know, Tim's bio kids. When you visit op, please check on them, if he's acting like this with the rest of the family, how is he with his kids? They really might need someone to lean on or help them out of a fucked up situation. This crap seems to have happened in months, there's no way his kids are ok with that shit forced on them.", "NTA. What Tim is doing is super weird and he ought to cut it out.", "NTA that adult has absolutely no relation to you. Th 1st grandchild getting married is Noah. That is a fact. Tim needs understand that getting married to someone sent automatically mean familial bonds\nYou have absolutely no relation to Jane and her 6  kids and Tim needs to accept that fact. \n\nIt doesn't matter how they receive you. Tim will be the one who reaps what he sows.Tim is the one who married someone he met 3 months ago. \nYou can be polite and cordial. But they shouldn't expect any type of familial bond with you or anyone in the family.", "Nta. All valid points.", "How is he an AH. he has never even met them before or ever heard of them until 2 weeks ago. And now suddenly he has more grandcchildren and he should treat them equally?", "Is it really necessary to declare the winner in the \"First!\" competitions?  \n\n>How could I claim her as my own and take any ownership or responsibility of her life and or marriage?\n\nHow would not arguing with Jack about Firsties! imply that you're responsible for his step daughter?  Are you afraid that if Sammy gets divorced your church circle will condemn you for her immorality?\n\nI can't decide between Y T A and E S H because this is such a WTF issue.  Jack's an idiot for marrying someone after just 3 months but I don't know if I should condemn or commend him for being so excited that his new stepdaughter is getting married soon.  (Is he just being overly welcoming like an excited puppy or is he trying to squish all the family into one big, happy delusion?)\n\nRegardless, be polite.  I doubt Sammy cares about being declared First! for your family but she'd be annoyed if it got twisted around to \"GMiL hates the fact that I'm getting married before one of her 'real' grandkids does.\"  Just tell Jack that it's great that Sammy is the First! of the next generation to get married and chill out.", "NTA your son and his current wife are being WAY TO SELFISH.", "Nta", "He is trying to visit them, and build a relationship. Not really a good start for that.", "NTA", "You've already decided that they aren't your family so I'm not sure why you're traveling to meet them. Yikes. YTA", "Also, OP, I would ask Tim if Sammy intends to take care of you when you're old. Will she fly across the country to care for you in the hospital? Does she intend to keep a room in her house for you when you visit? Probably not, because Sammy has no idea who you are. Tim is expecting OP to instantly act like family to a stranger."]}
