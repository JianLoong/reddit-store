If you don't know the person and haven't even met them, it's very hard to view them as family. I think you should be supportive if Tim's happy, so go to the wedding and meet his new wife and children, and just show Tim that you are there for him. But you shouldn't have to feel bad about not viewing a stranger as a family member.", "NTA.  Just because you marry someone, doesn\u2019t mean that the immediately become proper family particularly if you don\u2019t introduce them!  Difficult to be an instant Grand parent to someone you have never even seen.", "NTA.\n\nYour son needs to stop expecting all of you to get along with his new family in short span of time irrespective of what they mean to him. It's hard for people to bond and telling people it's the first wedding also doesn't sound right, he is trying too hard to make his new family fit into yours.", "NTA. You\u2019ve never met them and aren\u2019t related to them. Tim should stop trying to push his own narrative.", "NTA. Tim is rushing his (step) family immediately in your family\u2019s lives, when it takes a while (long time even) to get close with people. You only knew of Sammy for *two* weeks- and whether you want to be technical or not, you at the moment don\u2019t feel connected enough to feel like they are \u201cgrandchildren\u201d to you.\n\nI can understand Tim\u2019s excitement, but he needs to slow down. There have been other posts about family rushing people in their family like this, when clearly the family is rightfully not 100% ready. You expressed your feelings about it, and he should respect that.", "NTA", "NTA, You can't force anyone to accept a stranger as family. That takes time and it may still be the case that the grandchildren you have seen growing up, continue to feel more like family.", "You are NTA. Sammy is not your grandchild. That's absurd. End of story.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s highly unlikely that Sammy sees Tim as family or a parental figure because they met at most 3 months ago! It\u2019s different when the parents marry when kids are adults. \n\nYou have to question the judgement of someone who merges two large families with kids in such a short time. You aren\u2019t even supposed to let your new partner meet your kids until about 6 months and Tim has moved a family of 7 in with his 4 kids at 3 months??\n\nPlease do your best to check in on Tim\u2019s bio kids. Are they really okay with all this change so quickly? Where are they all staying? Does Tim or Jane have a house big enough to house 12??", "Tim seems to be TA here, not you!", "NTA.

So the first grandchild thing is an odd thing to tell the whole family because they won't be invited. \n\nYour not refusing to build a relationship with her or trying to be hurtful or unkind.

And there is a high probability that Sammy is rolling her eyes at her mom\u2019s fast marriage and the forced parent/grandparent language."]}
