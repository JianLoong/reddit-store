You\u2019ve offered playing something else and covering the cost for all three and also offered for everyone to buy their own copies. That\u2019s more than fair. \n\nMy partner and I have couple friends we go out for dinner with a couple times a month and the deal is we take turns paying. A little while ago we went for a fine dining experience (usually we just go to local spots). It was the other couple\u2019s \u201cturn\u201d and they\u2019d suggested we go there. Still, we immediately offered to pay our half and they were super grateful because while technically the deal would\u2019ve been that they paid they would\u2019ve paid far more than we\u2019d paid the previous time. When things are unusually expensive, standing arrangements shouldn\u2019t apply.", "NTA.\n\nOver time you etablished together the expectation how much the games usually cost which you play together. Jumping from 20$ to 60$ to spend on a game is a major deviation which requires a conversation. Are they also going to pay for 60$ in the future?\n\nNow I'm not sure why you guys just not pay for every game you olay yourselves. Would avoid having a situation like that in which they might try to fleece you.\n\nSo I'd say talk to them and tell them if they want to play more expensive games from now on everyone buys their game for themselves. Again the whole group buying setup makes things more complicated than it's necessary.", "NTA \n\nThey are taking advantage of you. They fully know what they're doing. Not your friends.", "NTA\n\nThat said, if they all want to play it together and you want to too, I'd put forward that ye all buy it individually (as it's about the normal costs of the 3x games round each) and make it clear that it will still be your round to buy afterwards.\n\nSo you'll just be delaying your turn, not skipping it or breaking the tradition, which sounds like good craic", "Give them $20 each (they can add the rest and buy the game for themselves ), buy the game just for yourself and end this game buying exchange thing. It's clearly not working as it should. If they want to continue it, then there should be a cost limit going forward. But it makes no sense to continue it. \n\nNTA\n\nEdited.", "No. Don't let them normalise you paying more. Sometimes 'fairness' is just what you won't put up with.\n\nYou did right. NTA", "NTA! Life is too expensive and nobody gets paid enough for this shit", "NTA - In fact, I would buy the game for myself without them knowing and enjoy playing it while they continue to act petty.  Their behaviour sure as f\\*ck would not make me want to change my mind.  It's your money and you decide how you spend it.\n\nAlso, this buying games for each other every few weeks is over.  Tell them to suck on that motherf\\*ckers!\n\nSh\\*t friends btw.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is easy: THEY are AHs trying to exploit you.

The thing is we're all over 40 and have a decent grasp on etiquette. The unspoken rule is that each taking a turn to pay usually means within the same price point. Like if a meal costs $150 and the next one is $130 and the other is $170, no biggie. But no one is going to spend $130 and then $150 and ask the friend to pick up a $300 tab. It would be unfair. \n\nYou can offer the following:\n\n- you reimburse each of them $15 and $20 respectively\n\n- you chip in $45-60 for another game \n\n- you give them $45-60 and they can buy whatever and you're done with this game purchase rotation and won't be participating in the future.", "NTA. But if you end up caving in, make sure the next game is $70 and see how they like it!", "NTA- I\u2019d offer to give them each $20 towards the cost of the game", "NTA. you all buy it yourselves, but it's still your turn next.\n\nMaybe next time, make it so if a game is more than $25, you stop this weird little tradition you have?\n\nHonestly this is why most people don't do this. It's just screaming complications. I don't know why you started, but it's just a bad idea.", "friends should never make you stress over money like that so, NTA  maybe there needs to be changes in your routine going forward too like if a game is over a certain amount we buy it for ourselves like others suggested !", "So, since this is an ongoing tradition - the net effect of everyone just buying their own copy would mean you can still play together but everyone pays exactly the same. (minus deals, etc)\n\nThat seems a smarter way forward as it also opens the door to other price brackets without these petty arguments or someone feeling shafted.", "NTA, obviously.\n\nWhat's really fascinating here is that you already had an established system for games over $35, which they suddenly seem to have agreed is no longer happening now, when it's your turn...\n\nIf you follow up with them, I'd ask them why they're not okay with doing what you've always done for more expensive games?", "NTA. Internet is full of scammers and I seen people pulling this particular one. Basically friend you up, buy you a cheap game then expect you to buy them a way more expensive game.\n\nYou could say its not an outright scam but trying to take advantage of you. I would just ignore and move on.", "NTA. Stop this habit. Buy your own games. I would contribute $20 to each of their purchases to complete the buyers round and keep it fair.", "Something I failed to mention in my post and in another comment i left, for games over like $35, we've always just bought them ourselves. Then when the next indie game came around, we'd hop back into our rotation.  It started because one of us would suggest a game to play and offer to buy it for everyone else (especially if they never heard of it before.)  It started as a friendly thing and none of us have minded our routine until now", "I do like this answer.  Normally for games over like $35 we would just buy it ourselves and keep the routine going after. That's part of why I was so flabbergasted by it", "This is the answer", "It's worked for 5-6 years until now. I can't see us ending this just because of this incident. If anything, we would just verbally agree on a price cap, which I think is a great idea and honestly should have been discussed before now. We all assumed on the \"rules\" but never clarified which was the thing that started sinking the ship.", "That is your opinion and you're 100% welcome to it, but it's worked for us for years until now. It started just as a polite thing we would do. \"Hey I wanna play this game, I'll buy it for you guys if you're willing to try it\"\n\nAnd then it became routine.", "The agreement has never been for $60 games. Anything over $35 we've always bought ourselves and then continued the rotation after.", "And they are deviating from your agreed rules of your rotation. When it more expensive everyone buys it for themselves. So from your comments I gather this grew organically and the rules were never clearly established, just through habit. Though it sounds like the person who buys the round so to speak is also the person who decides what game they buy and gift. If they want it so desperately played let them take the turn this time as another poster proposed.\n\nSo talk to them about this, but that it is not just to impose the price increase on you while it never happened before, but also that it would be wise to agree on some ground rules so that in the future this doesn't happen again and it would be a tragedy to end a thing you (and I assume the other two as well) enjoy about something like this. Preferably talk about this in voice chat or directly, as it decreases the chances if miscommunication and also will transfer your generally feelings towards this issue better. It will also give you a better idea if actually something is amiss.", "Yeah, bit weird ye have a \"normal\" procedure for it that wasn't applied this time... just say ye want to go with that so. People will always chance their arm here and there, we all do it I suppose. People who drink cocktails love getting into rounds all night with people who drink pints yk?", "What you could do if you wanted to compromise a bit more is pitch the $35 x3 and they cover the rest individually.\n\nThat would still be MIGHTY generous of you but could be a good one time compromise if this type of relationship means enough to you"]}
