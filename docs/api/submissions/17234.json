My brother (4M) received a little credit since he was little, and my other brother (15M) did as well, though he didn't help; he just said whether or not it looked good.\n\nOn Friday, the gift was complete, so we showed it to Mom that evening, and she liked it. We took a picture with it as well.\n\nWe had a garage sale on Saturday, but we all did our own thing afterward. That evening, I played with a few online friends and decided to stay up late since it was the weekend, and we didn't have plans on Sunday. I decided to go to bed around 2:30 AM.\n\nThis morning (Sunday), my Dad opens my door at 9:05 AM, which wakes me up; he asks me to help cook the eggs for Mother's Day. I explained to him that I was trying to sleep because I stayed up late and didn't know we planned to make breakfast beforehand so that I wouldn't stay up late.\n\nDad insists that I help with the eggs or the waffles, but I reiterated that I'm still trying to sleep because I stayed up late. He said I would help with the eggs and said a pan was out and that I had six minutes and started closing the door; I quickly tried to say that I had already told him.\n\nAt around 9:45 AM, he came in again while I was in bed asleep, the opening of the door woke me up, and he said, \"How do you think that'll make her feel? Hearing that you refused to help make her breakfast?\"\n\nI replied that I had already helped with her Mother's Day gift, and he said something along the lines that he was the one who had the idea and actually built it and that helping with breakfast is something I can have more control over. I replied, \"Got it; I wasn't a part of her gift.\"\n\nAfter some back-and-forth, he closed the door a little (it wasn't fully closed); and left to continue cooking.\n\nAt around 10:15 AM, breakfast was ready, and I was asleep; he came to my door, slammed it shut, and walked towards the kitchen cursing (about me, but he didn't call me any names from what I heard.) I'm not sure what he said, but I think it related to doing what I wanted and not what the household needed.\n\nI feel like he failed to communicate his plans and that if he had told me he intended on making breakfast the next morning for Mother's Day, even after her gift, it would've helped me to know not to stay up late under the impression that we finished Mother's Day and that we had nothing planned.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684087532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hiz69/aita_for_refusing_to_help_cook_on_mothers_day/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wasn't exactly prepared but I wouldn't have minded making a full breakfast had I known it was planned.\n\nWhen he introduced the gift idea, I thought it was perfect and after it was given to her, I (mistakenly) thought that was all, since he asked me beforehand if we should give her the gift on Mother's Day or give it to her early, but apparently my Dad had plans to make breakfast this morning which I didn't know about, which was why I stayed up late to spend time with a few friends who I haven't really talked to in a while.\n\nHowever, I still should've gotten up and if it's that big of a deal to me, I could've just made coffee while making the eggs.
