My brother (4M) received a little credit since he was little, and my other brother (15M) did as well, though he didn't help; he just said whether or not it looked good.\n\nOn Friday, the gift was complete, so we showed it to Mom that evening, and she liked it. We took a picture with it as well.\n\nWe had a garage sale on Saturday, but we all did our own thing afterward. That evening, I played with a few online friends and decided to stay up late since it was the weekend, and we didn't have plans on Sunday. I decided to go to bed around 2:30 AM.\n\nThis morning (Sunday), my Dad opens my door at 9:05 AM, which wakes me up; he asks me to help cook the eggs for Mother's Day. I explained to him that I was trying to sleep because I stayed up late and didn't know we planned to make breakfast beforehand so that I wouldn't stay up late.\n\nDad insists that I help with the eggs or the waffles, but I reiterated that I'm still trying to sleep because I stayed up late. He said I would help with the eggs and said a pan was out and that I had six minutes and started closing the door; I quickly tried to say that I had already told him.\n\nAt around 9:45 AM, he came in again while I was in bed asleep, the opening of the door woke me up, and he said, \"How do you think that'll make her feel? Hearing that you refused to help make her breakfast?\"\n\nI replied that I had already helped with her Mother's Day gift, and he said something along the lines that he was the one who had the idea and actually built it and that helping with breakfast is something I can have more control over. I replied, \"Got it; I wasn't a part of her gift.\"\n\nAfter some back-and-forth, he closed the door a little (it wasn't fully closed); and left to continue cooking.\n\nAt around 10:15 AM, breakfast was ready, and I was asleep; he came to my door, slammed it shut, and walked towards the kitchen cursing (about me, but he didn't call me any names from what I heard.) I'm not sure what he said, but I think it related to doing what I wanted and not what the household needed.\n\nI feel like he failed to communicate his plans and that if he had told me he intended on making breakfast the next morning for Mother's Day, even after her gift, it would've helped me to know not to stay up late under the impression that we finished Mother's Day and that we had nothing planned.\n\nAITA?\n\n**Edit:** Based on all your comments, I acknowledge that I screwed up. I should've gotten up to help with breakfast, but I didn't, and I'm ashamed that I didn't do better. I have decided to coordinate dinner and now I'm making dinner for Mom, it's something nice and I'm sure she'll love it. Thank you all for your perspectives and taking time out of your day to respond to my goof up. I've learned a lot from this and I'll apply what I've learned moving forward.

Your dad stomped all over that and tried to make you feel bad for not saying \"how high\" when he said \"jump.\" That's not good parenting - that's just authoritarian bs.

I say it was a good thing, because it made him come here and people told him he was an ah and hopefully he will become a better person because of this.\n\nYTA.", "Agreed", "Nice job!", "Commenting here so you will see it.\n\nI saw your edit and just wanted to tell you that we all make mistakes and misjudge situations, it speaks more to your character that you learned and corrected.", "OP, please don't let your mother do the dishes after your dinner either, maybe do those with your siblings.  You seem like you've really learned a lot here and this is the only thing I hadn't seen.  Good luck, I bet you'll make her next birthday and holidays awesome!", "That sounds like an awesome Mother's Day. You did it right!", "No kidding. My 11 year old bought me a gift with her own money and no one had to tell her to do it.", "I mean. He slept about 7 hours, he is 18, he could have gotten up.\nThe issue here is that the father was pissed the kids clearly don't give a damn about mothers and he was trying to make it special. And even when told what to do, they did the bare minimum.\n\nYTA. \n\nWhat you are saying about men needed people to tell them is called the mental load. Check it out, women mental load. It helps to put a lot on perspective.", "Umm. The first 2 things I learned to cook (with heat) as a child were scrambled eggs and pancakes. I made my mom Mother\u2019s Day breakfast 0 times in my life. I helped with dinner often but never breakfast. So no it\u2019s not an auto assumption. (Thinking back I don\u2019t think my mom really ate breakfast that often. Not like a real breakfast maybe some toast so that might be why. But the point is my family never did moms day breakfast. We did once make a scavenger hunt for her present though)", ">The dad never said come make the eggs. He came back several times to get the son up which tells me all the cooking was already done\n\nUm... what?\n\n>9:05 AM, which wakes me up; he asks me to help cook the eggs\n\n>Dad insists that I help with the eggs or the waffles\n\n>He said I would help with the eggs and said a pan was out\n\n>9:45 AM [...] left to continue cooking\n\n>At around 10:15 AM, breakfast was ready", "That's the thing, his dad was only asking for probably 1 hr max....op is just selfish, but at least he took the comments to heart and put an edit on.....hopefully he now really does understand the issue", "Lmao since this is AITA you just hadddd to get a dig in about the husband, can't help yourself\ud83d\ude02", "Dad did nothing wrong.", "My mum said that to me and wondered why I choose not to have kids.", "My mom said that and I PRAYED for a kid like me.

I mean the OP actually said its mothers day and he knew they had no plans that day...who doesn't have plans on mothers day for their mother?", "Definitely agree the 15 year old should be involved.  My 15 year old daughter took the initiative to get her father to take her to the mall so she could get me some bath stuff in my favorite summer scent which she bought with her own money she has made from pet and babysitting.", "Nope. And I feel like you can\u2019t even really tell them because then your guilting them.", "And with alcohol. LoL", "Preach! I remember seeing friends that age get off work on Friday, party all weekend and go back to work Monday with less than 10 hours sleep combined... OP can suck it up for 1 breakfast. \n\nGlad he's doing a nice dinner for Mom, she'll appreciate his efforts!", "On a Sunday that\u2019s plenty early for some. I\u2019m a grown-ass adult and I\u2019m not doing anything before noon on the weekend if I wasn\u2019t made aware of those plans the day before. Sleeping in is literally what I look forward to most about days I don\u2019t work.\n\nStill silly of OP to not realize they would be celebrating Mother\u2019s Day *on* Mother\u2019s Day, but equally silly of dad to not run his plan by OP the day before.", "Ooof.  I\u2019m sorry if my comment caused you any harm.", "there is literally vacation video of my mom going \"what will your kids think when they see this?\" in response to my meltdown and my 5yr old self goes  \"I'm not having kids!\" ... got diagnosed as a teen with a condition that makes kids very unlikely", "God how amazing is Bluey?!", "I unabashedly have used parenting techniques from Bluey episodes on my now-4yo, like explaining that we'll keep some art and other art can become new paper for other kids to draw on. My husband gets a kick out of observing how accurate Bingo is.", "The edit of OP acknowledging his goof really warms my heart. Kudos for listening to the people around you and not digging your heels in! I hope the dinner went well and mom had a wonderful day!", "I would say YTA, but based on your edit it sounds like you were the asshole, read the comments, reflected, and modified your behavior. That's way more than a lot of people do. I hope dinner turned out well!", "2:30 am to 9 am is 6 and a half hours my guys \ud83d\ude43", "For a shitty picture frame with a disingenuous saying. \n\nSorry not sorry, the only way I\u2019d be like ooh thanks this is the best is if the four year old actually picked it out.

Maybe the dad didn\u2019t talk to him the night before because OP was playing video games all night. Exerting power would be forcing the son to make breakfast with no option.
