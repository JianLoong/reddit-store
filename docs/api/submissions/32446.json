So is your mom.\n\nMy father was given a name that in previous generations had been a male name in his family but by the time he was born it was exclusively female in my country and he hated it and went by his middle name his whole life.", "NTA, If I knew my son was being teased because of his name, I would be very understanding if he wanted to change this.\n\n I would probably regret giving you a name, that causes so much pain.", "INFO: Have you ask your mother why she gave you a girly name? And how this is not disrespectfull to you.\n\nWNBTA for changing your name. Don't know how old you are, but if you are not allowed to legally change it yet, maybe go by a nick name till then.

Decision wasn\u2019t yours in the beginning but it is now and you should take it if it makes you feel better. Always, always, always listen to yourself and follow your heart/stomach. \n\nBesides, people who love you truly will love you no matter the name and will support you because your happiness is a priority. So this name changing can be a great filter :)\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA. In no way at all would you be the a h for doing that. In fact, no matter the reason, I think anybody has the right to change their name, regardless of reason. It is not disrespectful to your parents at all.", "NTA\n\nYour mother made a mistake and you have to pay for it. I suspect she and your family are behaving like this because when you were born people told them this is a stupid idea and they didn't listen.

If someone wants a name from a show why don't they change their own name? And a girls name for a boy, that's cruel. It would be disrespectful to her? Good grief, where were they when she gave you a girl's name? Where's the respect for you? Call them the wrong name, call aunt's \"Uncle\", call your mother \"Dad\".  Change it, and post the forms to Mum so she can change hers to the show name. And buy her a copy of \"A boy called Sue\" by Johnny Cash.", "Eff your family, Sue. They don\u2019t need to deal with it.

It's disrespectful to name a child something that will get them harassed.  Parents need to really think before naming a child.

Your parents were disrespectful to you for giving you a poor name. Change it to what you want. Both my sister and I modified our first names because they were not appropriate names for grown women. Please do what would make you happy. Mother will get over it.", "YWNBTA\n\nYour mother can be angry if she chooses to be, that is of no consequence. You don't like your name and if you're willing to go to the effort to change it, that is your right and only your business.", "NTA.  If you feel the names don't represent you, that's your own choice.   But don't be surprised that your parents take it very personally (right or wrong) that you're rejecting something they chose.", "NTA. Change your name. She named you after a TV character - I don\u2019t even see how you\u2019re being disrespectful. If you\u2019re at all inclined to placate your mom, you could involve her in choosing your new name or even keep the middle name.

My bf has a girls first name too(though his is a family name and he would never change it) so he goes by his middle name. However he hates how he was bullied for his name and when we go out waiters/waitress' will always hand me his card back which embarrasses him. You are allowed to change your name. It's YOUR name. YOU have to live with it. Your mother likely is a person that thought she was naming her baby rather than a male child that would grow into an adult that has a traditionally feminine name. If you don't have a good relationship with her anyway and never had then go ahead and change your name.", "God do you guise remember Sabrina? He also did not enjoy having a female name. Names matter, words and language and culture matters. If she wanted her SON to keep the name she gave HIM she should have given HIM a MALE name.\n\nNTA, go get yourself a male name boy.", "NTA ask those people why they care more about your mother\u2019s feelings than they do about you being bullied because of her choices", "NTA \n\nChange your name live your life, its honestly your choice and your mother's feelings should not be in consideration here.", "Your name is yours.

If it is genuinely a burden on you and changing it will improve your happiness, then you're not wrong to go for it. But names are gifts and it sounds like your mom picked something meaningful even if it didn't work out. Acknowledging that in the new name might alleviate some of the negativity you're feeling.   \n\n\nAlso, you haven't said how old you are so I'm just going to put out there that at least in English, all names are girl names. My first name is the same as my dad, grandfather, and great-grandfather, in my generation it's fairly unisex and in younger generations, it skews hard towards girls. You're unlikely to find a name with much masculine niche protection and if your concerns are rooted in managing interactions with your peers, age will level off most unpleasantness.", "We only name our children because they can\u2019t name themselves at birth.

I don't blame you at all. Having a girl's name when you're a boy cannot have been easy for you and I cannot understand her thinking it would be interesting? For whom? Certainly not for you. \n\nJust because family tell you something doesn't mean it's right. If anything your mum was being disrespectful naming you with only her interests at heart rather than yours.", "NTA. I hate the disrespectful comment because it's always basically \"you gotta disrespect yourself to keep the respect for other people\" \nYou are the one who has to live with the name. Do what makes your quality of life better.", "NTA, and you have the right to be called anything you'd like. Let everyone know your new name even if you don't get around to changing it legally for a while. Don't respond when someone calls you by your former name. It has nothing to do with disrespecting your mom's choice. It's about what you want and are comfortable with.", "Do people call you by your given name(s)? You can have people call you whatever you'd like and tell your family it isn't legally changed. Then when they've calmed down you can legally change it. If you're underage just wait until you're a legal adult and don't need anyone's permission. \n\nIn this day and age the idea of name changes and dead-names is not obscure, so I feel like you won't have as much trouble with the general public with using a new name. Your family might revert to the old name, but at that point you can just consider it a family quirk. I know a lot of immigrants with ethnic names that their family uses in the house, but out of the house the westernized name is used. I know there's backlash about this, but hey it's hard to stick to your guns when your name is Yoo Suk.", "If you're getting teased currently, I'm going to assume you're still a minor.  I think you may feel differently in a couple years, because unique names hit differently in college/as an adult.  But once you're an adult, do whatever you want, it's your name.  YWNBTA", "NTA. Your mom named you after a *TV character*? Okay, so mom likes that show... but to saddle you with a female name? Outrageous. I mean, how emotionally attached can your mom truly feel to a fictional character?\n\nYour relatives should be telling you that it's about time to address this situation. It's your name and you need to feel comfortable in your own life.", "Nope, it's your name, and if your parent picked a stupid name, that could oh so obviously lead to issues, then you're absolutely in the right to change it.\n\nHonestly I'd be thinking hard about how much I wanted to keep the surname, if family are all being buttheads about it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA do what makes you happy, it\u2019s your life your name and only you decide what you\u2019re comfortable with, if changing your name makes you feel comfortable and happy then I think when your family sees that they will eventually stop being upset.
