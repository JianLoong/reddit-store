She has Type 1 diabetes and had some other health issues so her drug bill alone is around $400-500/month at least. We broke up relatively amicably 2 years ago and I forgot about her being on my health insurance but when I remembered I just kept it because she can\u2019t afford drugs without it. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s illegal but thankfully they never checked. \n\nFast forward my gf and I found out she will need a root canal and crown eventually which is very expensive, around $3000. I remembered I had $1500/year in my dental benefits and because she is living with me I can switch common law to her. But the problem is my ex is still on the plan and I never bothered to take her off. I called her up and told her I had to take her off the plan because my current gf needs to be on the plan for dental. She cried and demanded I keep her on it because she is currently unemployed. She got laid off a few months ago and says she can\u2019t afford drugs without it. \n\nBut my current gf needs the root canal soon and health insurance companies will be suspicious if I take my ex off and immediately put my gf on. I told her I will have to take her off end of Dec and she will have till then to find a job. She called me an asshole saying she can\u2019t afford her drugs even with a job (she doesn\u2019t have any education to mostly works low wage retail jobs) and I told her being on my insurance forever was never going to be a long term solution for her and she needs to figure out something else. I don\u2019t love her anymore but I feel guilty because she won\u2019t be able to afford her drugs. And my gf isn\u2019t happy because it\u2019s possible she can\u2019t afford to wait that long for the root canal so the dental money will only be able to be able to be used for the crown and cleanings.", "created_utc": 1668794916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyqjae/aita_for_taking_away_my_exs_health_insurance/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Surely, your ex could find something.", "NTA. You are both adults and as such are responsible for yourselves. She has failed to take any action in two years. She is not your responsibility.

Otherwise you'll both end up SOL and she still would end up without coverage anyway.\n\nIt's not your responsibility, but maybe help her apply for state insurance or find programs to help her get the insulin she needs?

Yes, this should have been discussed at the time of the break up. But it wasn\u2019t, and you\u2019re giving your ex notice. That\u2019s all you\u2019re obligated to do.

ESH", ">had she been proactive when you broke up, she wouldnt be in this situation currently.\n\nShe might be, and the odds are she probably WOULD be.  OP indicates that she doesn't have much education, and struggles to find anything but retail jobs that don't offer health insurance.   There are tons of employers who do anything to avoid having to give their employees benefits.\n\nThe situation sucks for her, it really does.  There's a lot of people in her position.  The American healthcare system is crap, and it shouldn't be based on employment.  etc.\n\nBut that isn't OP's responsibility.  He did give her more time.  You are correct that she should have used that time to see what solution she could find.  \n\nThe odds are that she didn't do so, and just took staying on OP's health insurance for granted.  That's a terrible move, and it's extremely short-sighted of her.\n\nHowever, it's also true that she could have taken the full two years and been unable to figure out a solution.  It's not easy to do and it doesn't just happen if you work hard enough.  There are people who bust their ass to try to figure it out and are unsuccessful.  Insulin prices are a travesty.\n\nSo I feel for her.  But she needs to be contacting agencies to find help.  Not telling OP that they can never get married to anyone else, or tell OP they need to continue committing insurance fraud.", "I don't even understand how he's able to insure girlfriends????\n\nI've never ever heard of that being allowed.", "For the current girlfriend, employers aren't legally required to offer dental insurance. Companies also don't have to offer health insurance if they are a small business.

It's not OPs problem anymore.", "How does that make OP the asshole?", "At a previous employer I was able to by claiming her as a Domestic Partner. It was a Federally taxed benefit, so they'd add what _they_ paid into my paycheck, tax me on it, and then take it back out.", "My insurance covers common law", "You can cover domestic partners, you don't have to be married.", "Common law is instant where you live?", "Ok, but how do you even expect this to work\n\nSo your ex is still your common law spouse according to the insurance company, so even if you removed her today, the earliest you could possibly claim to have a new common law spouse is in a full year, as the shortest timeframe for common law recognition is one year in the few states that recognize them, many being longer.\n\nIf you claim that you've been in a committed cohabitating relationship with your current girlfriend for a year, then you are admitting to insurance fraud.", "Ya I\u2019m hoping to wait till next year to add my current gf and I\u2019d probably have proposed by then if everything goes well. So the dental might not cover the root canal if she needs it earlier than that but she can put in a filling and wait for a crown", "If you are still \"if everything goes well\" this relationship, I would hold off adding her to your insurance."]}
