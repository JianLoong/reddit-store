It's not easy to do and it doesn't just happen if you work hard enough.  There are people who bust their ass to try to figure it out and are unsuccessful.

You are no longer involved so no, she can not be on your insurance.\n\nYour new love also needs her own insurance and not to rely on you. There might be a delay in when your coverage extends to her so if she can't afford to wait, someone has to pay out of pocket until the insurance kicks in.\n\nAt my job, every year in November, you can add/drop dependents, change plans etc. Do you not have this where you work?Do you not review your health plans every year to see if any changes need to be made? Are you in the habit of just adding whoever is your girlfriend at the time to your insurance?\n\nGet out your insurance material and read it. Find out what is covered and what is not. Remove your ex from your insurance now and find out how soon you can add the new one.", "Didn\u2019t she do anything at all to alleviate this problem? Not wise.", "Seems like the system is down on this one", "NTA. You\u2019ve been paying her insurance for two years, enough is enough. I feel for her because insulin has no business being as expensive as it is, and that\u2019s a huge financial hardship to deal with, but she\u2019s not your responsibility. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation for her, but you need to take care of yourself and your little family first. \n\nYou\u2019ve already been more than generous by providing her insurance for two years, you don\u2019t owe her anything else.", "Not only that, he would have to pay back all the benefits they paid out for her.", "Insurance through the affordable care act still costs money. Mine costs over $700 a month.\n\n\"Affordable care\" doesn't mean \"I can pay for this with a handful of dimes.\" It means \"I can at least get insurance for less than the $6,000 a month I'd have paid for my pre-existing conditions.\"", "But common law doesn\u2019t usually come into affect until after like 7-10 years of being together if I\u2019m remembering the law correctly.", "Right. OP says -\n\n> My ex and I lived together and were common law.\n\nThe phrase is \"common law marriage\" and legally, it's just like, \"plain old marriage\". It's not a synonym for \"long-term relationship\". If the OP is common law married to his previous partner, then he needs to get a \"plain old divorce\" before trying to sub in a new partner.\n\nContinuing to allow his former partner to represent herself as his wife to their insurance would mean that he can't backdate their breakup to whenever they agreed to call it quits. They're still married in the eyes of the law (if their common law marriage was valid in their state.)", "My company insurance covers for domestic partners, so his might say that instead of common law.", "If the need for the root canal is already diagnosed, the insurance may not cover it anyway as a pre-existing condition. You should double check your plan\u2019s fine print.", "So\u2026 root canals are only needed when the root is infected. She either DOES need it or she DOES NOT need it. If a filling would work now, it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t need a root canal and she should get the filling. Root canals are usually an emergency procedure, not something that you can postpone indefinitely.", "Yeah CA is like that. No common law here though some insurances let you insure a dependent domestic partner.", "It depends on the state. For example in Iowa to end a common law marriage one has to get a divorce to end the common law marriage.", "NTA. It's illegal! You could lose your health insurance and be charged for this, and also be responsible for paying back the money for her drugs that she wasn't entitled too. \n\nGer her off before you lose your benefits.", "If your ex is in the US, she needs to immediately file for Medicaid or the health benefits her state offers. She can do so at the same time as filing for SNAP and TANF if she qualifies. There maybe a starter website that will let her know what assistance she might qualify for. You need to get her off your insurance before you both get caught. Usually there is an enrollment period when you can make changes. \n\nYou said common law, which I think mostly doesn't exist in the US anymore so you may not be in the US. If you aren't, there is probably some kind of health care available?", "YTA, and im surprised the N T A votes dont see the serious legal shitstorm youre tempting here.\n\nIm gonna assume your mention of \"common law\" means you were in a common law marriage.  If so, your ex can file divorce proceedings against you and sue for support.  That support may include continued health insurance, alimony, property, etc.  Results may vary by jurisdiction, but really, you need to get the marriage ended legally before tossing her off your insurance.\n\nSecond, I suspect you have committed insurance fraud, or youre about to.  Common law spouses cannot be swapped in and out like boyfriends and girlfriends.  But insurance won't cover a gf.  I suspect you're calling these women your spouse specifically to obtain insurance.  Joke's on you then - your ex is now your wife, so your new paramour can't be your spouse.  Obtaining insurance for her on false pretenses may be a crime.\n\nIn sum, you're screwing around with stupid legal risks because you don't want to do things the right way.  Grow up.  Get a divorce, but answer your legal obligations to your common law wife in the meantime.  Sad to say it, but your new gal cannot get insurance through you, because you cannot truthfully call her your common law spouse.", "vision and some dental plans are $15.95 a month so your ex has no excuse not to get her meds health  depends on the deductable for the marketplace or medicaid for the poorest of the lot", "If she works an entry level job, she would probably meet the income threshold to be eligible for state Medicaid.", " Common law marriage was discontinued for anyone\n\u201cmarrying\u201dafter 2005 and I\u2019m not sure federal recognizes it without a lot of proof that you lived together as husband and wife.", "That makes sense. Here we generally have a 30-90 day waiting period before coverage kicks in.", "That\u2019s a state by state thing. Federal has nothing to do with it. But OP must mean unmarried domestic partner, which some insurance covers, because what he\u2019s describing is very much NOT common law marriage by anybody\u2019s law I\u2019ve ever heard of.", "So this actually depends\u2026sometimes you need them for a cracked tooth that is causing discomfort but no infection (an issue I have had in the past).
