Same type of guy who would try and strike up a friendship with a woman only to find out she\u2019s taken so he gets angry at her for \u201cwasting his time\u201d.

And cheap.", "NTA, based upon what you said it was focused on you and gave you the feeling he was trying to hook up more or less.\n\nIf it was questions about he area and what there is to do around that area it would be different but since the questions were personal it's a good indication in itself he was interested in you.", "NTA.

I\u2019ve had encounters like that in the service industry way back when I was bartending and it can get weird real quick. My best advice is to start with \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d as soon as the personal questions come up so you don\u2019t have to slip it in later once it gets awkward. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m from BFE but my fiance and I just bought a house in Shithole.\u201d \u201cWhat do you do for fun?\u201d \u201cI really enjoy antique shopping with my fianc\u00e9 on the weekends, so much fun.\u201d", "NTA. Somebody can\u2019t handle rejection & was taking it out on you, OP.", "As a former waitress and one who fully knows the crap we get for pay, you should have thought that through a little longer. The difference between zero tip and a $100 dollar bill. Not saying string him along but y\u2019all former waitresses out there know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. And I wouldn\u2019t feel bad as he was a creep anyhow.", "Yeah, former waitress here. Build it into the answers \u201coh I don\u2019t get up to much. My fianc\u00e9 and I are homebodies.\u201d", "Ehh, I agree with you this is how OP should handle these interactions outside of work. But while working as a waitress that will unfortunately effect your tips negatively.   \n\n\nOP is absolutely NTA and no one has any obligation to get sexually harassed or made uncomfortable at work. That being said- if OP is looking for ways to handle this at work without impacting her income, this is personally how I deal with this as someone\u2018s who worked as a server or bartender everywhere from dive bars to strip clubs. \n\nI don\u2019t tell customers I\u2019m in a relationship, period unless they\u2018re regulars I have a friendly relationship with. I don\u2019t flirt or encourage anything, but I don\u2019t shut them down and remain friendly. If they ask to see me outside work, I make non committal comments about being busy. I\u2019ll take their number if they offer, but never hit them up. If they see you again in person, rinse and repeat being busy.   \n\n\nMy BF knows this and doesn\u2019t care at all because he knows I make more money this way. Maybe it\u2019s a bit unethical, but so is hitting on someone who can\u2019t say what\u2018s actually on their mind without being potentially fired. And yes, you shouldn\u2019t have to pretend to be single to make money, it sucks- but that\u2019s the industry and you either gotta be okay with or accept that you will make less money than the girls who act single.  \n\nStill NTA, but it\u2019s maybe some advice that will help OP deal with these situations without hurting their income. Quite frankly I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s relationship status is their business anyways and offering that information freely can do nothing but hurt your tips. Most of the time telling them that doesn\u2019t stop the sexual harassment anyways.", "It's just it seems like women get a lot of hate for rejecting men before they've even had a chance to ask them out.  Like assuming every man who talks to them is into them or something.  I just kind of felt like I was acting like one of them.", "He just said that line to not look foolish lol", "Agreed.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

NTA, OP.", "Guys like that thrive in the plausible deniability of not actually asking you out, but otherwise showing their interest in any other way.\n\nIt's a trap.\n\nIf you shut them down early, they take refuge in calling you presumptuous and pretend they were never interested. If you don't respond to the hints then they complain about being \"friend-zoned\" or some similar nonsense.\n\nTrust your gut, keep shutting these guys down, and remember that their hurt ego is not your responsibility.", "The whole point is to make you uncomfortable saying no. Like it's ridiculous that a waitress would ever feel obligated to entertain this, and I never hit on waitresses or anyone I'm a client of, it's creepy and inappropriate.\n\nBut many men want to maximise the chances of women saying 'yes' even if they don't really want to, and creating this kind of discomfort is a big part of that, sometimes through the implied threat of physical violence, but mostly this kind of thing. You shouldn't have to put up with it in the work place or anywhere else, don't feel bad about it at all.", "Women always get hate no matter what they do. So don't worry about it. That's actually a really good life lesson to learn. The earlier you understand it, the better for your quality of life and happiness.\n\nCreeps like that take an advantage of women who do customer service jobs because the woman is supposed to be friendly and easily approachable. When they ask personal questions just give very round answer or avoid answering it entirely or even lying is good! Sometimes I even had a deal with guys who worked with me that I point to one and claim he is my partner and my colleague would back me up.", "I\u2019ve seen the reverse actually, men get a bad rap for asking women out at all. That guy in your situation though was being inappropriate though", "Girl, don\u2019t reject anyone until the bill is paid!\n\nI\u2019m kinda joking, but also kinda serious. Honestly you can avoid this situation entirely in the future by not telling them you have a SO. You are truly not obligated to share that info at work especially with a random customer. If they\u2019re obviously flirting, just stay nice and do your job. Make up work to do and walk away if they get too chatty. If they try to make plans with you be non committal and say you\u2019re busy. If they give you their number take it and never text them. People get the hint fast if you do see them again.\n\nI gave up on trying to reject people at work years ago. Most of the time they don\u2019t care you\u2019re in a relationship anyways and it really can\u2019t do anything good for your tips. You\u2019re NTA for telling him, but honestly this is the way to go in the future to avoid these scenarios. If they\u2019re dumb or sleazy enough to try to sleep with their waitress, take their money and move on!"]}
