I\u2019ve had encounters like that in the service industry way back when I was bartending and it can get weird real quick. My best advice is to start with \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d as soon as the personal questions come up so you don\u2019t have to slip it in later once it gets awkward. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m from BFE but my fiance and I just bought a house in Shithole.\u201d \u201cWhat do you do for fun?\u201d \u201cI really enjoy antique shopping with my fianc\u00e9 on the weekends, so much fun.\u201d", "NTA. Somebody can\u2019t handle rejection & was taking it out on you, OP.", "As a former waitress and one who fully knows the crap we get for pay, you should have thought that through a little longer. The difference between zero tip and a $100 dollar bill. Not saying string him along but y\u2019all former waitresses out there know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. And I wouldn\u2019t feel bad as he was a creep anyhow.", "Yeah, former waitress here. Build it into the answers \u201coh I don\u2019t get up to much. My fianc\u00e9 and I are homebodies.\u201d", "Ehh, I agree with you this is how OP should handle these interactions outside of work. But while working as a waitress that will unfortunately effect your tips negatively.   \n\n\nOP is absolutely NTA and no one has any obligation to get sexually harassed or made uncomfortable at work. That being said- if OP is looking for ways to handle this at work without impacting her income, this is personally how I deal with this as someone\u2018s who worked as a server or bartender everywhere from dive bars to strip clubs. \n\nI don\u2019t tell customers I\u2019m in a relationship, period unless they\u2018re regulars I have a friendly relationship with. I don\u2019t flirt or encourage anything, but I don\u2019t shut them down and remain friendly. If they ask to see me outside work, I make non committal comments about being busy. I\u2019ll take their number if they offer, but never hit them up. If they see you again in person, rinse and repeat being busy.   \n\n\nMy BF knows this and doesn\u2019t care at all because he knows I make more money this way. Maybe it\u2019s a bit unethical, but so is hitting on someone who can\u2019t say what\u2018s actually on their mind without being potentially fired. And yes, you shouldn\u2019t have to pretend to be single to make money, it sucks- but that\u2019s the industry and you either gotta be okay with or accept that you will make less money than the girls who act single.  \n\nStill NTA, but it\u2019s maybe some advice that will help OP deal with these situations without hurting their income. Quite frankly I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s relationship status is their business anyways and offering that information freely can do nothing but hurt your tips. Most of the time telling them that doesn\u2019t stop the sexual harassment anyways.", "It's just it seems like women get a lot of hate for rejecting men before they've even had a chance to ask them out.

If you don't respond to the hints then they complain about being \"friend-zoned\" or some similar nonsense.\n\nTrust your gut, keep shutting these guys down, and remember that their hurt ego is not your responsibility.", "The whole point is to make you uncomfortable saying no. Like it's ridiculous that a waitress would ever feel obligated to entertain this, and I never hit on waitresses or anyone I'm a client of, it's creepy and inappropriate.\n\nBut many men want to maximise the chances of women saying 'yes' even if they don't really want to, and creating this kind of discomfort is a big part of that, sometimes through the implied threat of physical violence, but mostly this kind of thing. You shouldn't have to put up with it in the work place or anywhere else, don't feel bad about it at all.", "Women always get hate no matter what they do. So don't worry about it. That's actually a really good life lesson to learn. The earlier you understand it, the better for your quality of life and happiness.\n\nCreeps like that take an advantage of women who do customer service jobs because the woman is supposed to be friendly and easily approachable. When they ask personal questions just give very round answer or avoid answering it entirely or even lying is good! Sometimes I even had a deal with guys who worked with me that I point to one and claim he is my partner and my colleague would back me up.", "I\u2019ve seen the reverse actually, men get a bad rap for asking women out at all. That guy in your situation though was being inappropriate though", "Girl, don\u2019t reject anyone until the bill is paid!\n\nI\u2019m kinda joking, but also kinda serious. Honestly you can avoid this situation entirely in the future by not telling them you have a SO. You are truly not obligated to share that info at work especially with a random customer. If they\u2019re obviously flirting, just stay nice and do your job. Make up work to do and walk away if they get too chatty. If they try to make plans with you be non committal and say you\u2019re busy. If they give you their number take it and never text them. People get the hint fast if you do see them again.\n\nI gave up on trying to reject people at work years ago. Most of the time they don\u2019t care you\u2019re in a relationship anyways and it really can\u2019t do anything good for your tips. You\u2019re NTA for telling him, but honestly this is the way to go in the future to avoid these scenarios. If they\u2019re dumb or sleazy enough to try to sleep with their waitress, take their money and move on!", "NTA my wife makes an appearance in every get to know you conversation I ever have with a member of the opposite sex. I think it sets the tone for what\u2019s important yes", "NTA.   \n\n\nHe didn't care that you were taken, and he didn't care that he was taken. He was trying to pick you up and you drew the boundary line clearly for him. Well done. You're a waitress not a sex worker.", "NTA but as a word of wisdom you shouldn't have to use your fiance as an excuse to tell someone to stop being a creep. You're not property, being 'taken' shouldn't make the slightest bit of difference. You deserve to not be creeped on regardless of your relationship status. If it ever happens again I hope you feel confident enough to tell them to piss right off and/or refuse service.", "Good idea except never tell them where you live", "He might have been telling the truth but that would make it even worse.", "People call it hate when it\u2019s really just men with hurt feelings acting like children. \u201cHate\u201d makes it sound intriguing. Men crying over hurt feelings sounds lame because it is.", "Personally, I hate when women start acting like men were flirting with them. For example, when someone asks a woman if she is using a certain equipment in the gym or how many reps she has left. That isn't flirting, that's just gym etiquette. It's become a recent trend on TikTok to 'call out' people who are 'flirting' with them at the gym.\n\nThis however was flirting and it is totally acceptable for you to have said so. If you care about tips/need them then I would suggest not saying that. Keep certain information a secret and then ignore him/block him after. Perfectly acceptable to do so in my opinion.", "NTA\n\nYou never have to give anyone personal info. Learn to set polite but firm boundaries to protect yourself from potential creeps. \n\nBecause one day the creepy guy won't care if you have a fiance or a husband so the less they know about you, the better.\n\nAnd you did need to stop him because otherwise you'd be accused of leading him on. \n\nCustomer service and hospitality Jobs require firm but polite boundaries: I'm sorry sir, did you need a refill? I'm not going to discuss my personal life with customers but I'll be glad to get you another coffee.", "NTA. He\u2019s a creep.

He doesn't get rejected; he does the rejecting.  Pay no attention.  He would have undoubtedly twisted it in his mind by the time he left that he wasn't interested in you anyway.\n\nI've seen it said before that it is sad you have to be another man's property, in order to be left alone.  However, the counter to that is, it got the creep to leave you alone.  Anyway you do what you have to so that creeps leave you alone.", "NTA\n\nHe's just mad he'd not going to get fuck you, there was no way ot of that where he wasn't angry.", "NTA. He didn't tip you because he realized there was no way he could have sex with you, and wanted to punish you for this. That a woman has to resort to the 'I have a fiance' trope because for some man who just don't respect women that is the only reason they accept for a woman not wanting them is another sad story....", "NTA \n\nYou did the right thing. Even if you don't have someone you don't exist to be gawped at.", "NTA and fuck the fact that society has you thinking you even remotely could be. Next time, when they say they have a girlfriend/partner, say \u201cso your partner is cool with you eye fucking random people? Cool for you if they are but don\u2019t make me one of them.\u201d", "NTA I work in an adult store, and I bring up my husband A LOT. Usually, because I get flirted with a lot and people respect my relationship more than me. But sometimes it's because \"I'm not interested\" isn't enough.\n\nI have a customer who I have served twice, and both times, he has flirted hard, and I mentioned my husband more than once. The other day I leaned over the counter to show him something and he mentioned something about my hair colour, it's 2 toned so I flipped it back to show him the colour underneath and he took this as an invitation to touch my hair and cup the back of my head. I immediately said \"do not touch me\" and his first reaction was \"oh you don't want the cameras to see\"  I responded \"I couldn't give a shit about the cameras I just don't want you touching me\" *blank stare* \"I'm also married and I don't think my husband would appriciate it\" that got through!

Getting hit on gets old.", "NTA. \n\nSpoiler: He doesn't have a GF, that was his defence mechanism kicking in. One of his next questions was along the lines of *\"when do you finish\"* or *\"what days do you work\"* (so he can invite you out on one you're not in) but when you made it apparent that 1. You're taken and not interested and 2. Staring at you in a creepy way for an extended amount of time wasn't as subtle as he thought his ego took a massive kicking and went into defence mode with the equivalent of a kid saying *\"well I didn't want it anyway\"* when they didn't get what they wanted.", "That's info he can use to stalk her if he's a real creepy guy. No info given is best.", "Some guys will just get mad anyways though, that\u2019s one of the joys of customer service.
