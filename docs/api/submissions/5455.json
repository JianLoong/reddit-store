Are you an adult?\n\nYou should have stood up and given the child the seat and moved out of the way. \n\nYta", "ESH. You could have responded differently, they could have explained the fire regulations. Except, it\u2019s also against code to have handbags and coats etc in the aisle way, so by asking your son to move, they should have asked every single other person to pick up their things.", "The teacher needed to find a chair or help in another way.", "YTA twice over. First time for ignoring requests which staff most likely had to enforce due to safety regulations. Regulations are not opinions that you can debate. 2nd YTA because you come here seeking judgement and just double down and argue about it. Take your judgement and move on.", "YTA- soft.    It is a hazard.   In the event of a panic, your son would not be able to get out of the way.   Obviously it was fine with you, but schools can not take that chance.", "NTA -\nThey didn't give a reason for not wanting your son to sit in the aisle and didn't provide an alternative. There is nothing wrong with letting your son sit on the floor. And if they didn't provide a reason for BS rules then I don't see the need to follow BS rules - good on you for calling them out on said BS rules.\n\nBy the sound of your language, you may have been rude, but we don't have a transcript so can't really comment on this. But also when people get a bee in their bonet about following BS rules they can get obtuse about it, so being direct in calling that out is going to come across as rude to them.", "yta.  Honestly, they should of not let you in.  Clearly, they were at full capacity  It is a safety issue.  If one person can sit in the aisle, so can any person.  I cannot think if a single venue where it is ok to sit in the aisle.", "ESH. If there was no more seats anywhere, then that is a different story and not the asshole. If there was a spot that maybe you or your ex could move to, then you were an asshole.\n\n\nMore likely they didn\u2019t want anyone to trip.", "The teacher didn\u2019t say anything about anyone having their purses or whatever else in the aisle. If they did, then I\u2019d agree that OP was an AH but if the aisles were spacious enough for people to get by easily than the teacher/staff was just being a nag. \n\n\u201cOh your kid can\u2019t sit there\u201d\n\n\u201cWell there aren\u2019t any other seats anywhere, and kid is not blocking the aisle.\u201d \n\nTeacher could have pointed out a free seat or an alternative, but didn\u2019t.", "He's not female.", "Ok so hear me out. My guess is if there had been a fire the boy would have stood up and proceeded where everyone was directed to go. The guy said his son was not in the way I see no reason to not believe him as I wasn't there.", "Some people just like to b*tch any change they get. Hopefully she was just having a bad day", "Except he won\u2019t get trampled on in his seat if other people start fleeing first.", "Let me paint you a picture:  there\u2019s a fire or a gas leak or *something* that causes a major panic and everyone is rushing to get to the exit. The staff are most likely trained to some degree to know what to do and how to avoid adding to said panic. The bags and purses are small and will at the most result in some stumbling or crushed belongings. \n\nYour son, however, is a young child who does not know what to do in the case of an emergency. He is also a very human-sized obstacle that can move erratically and unpredictably. He is sitting, which makes him closer to the floor, in the exact area where he would be more exposed to being kicked and trampled on by the most powerful part of the human body, the legs, as people are in a rush to get out. If one person trips over him, it would cause more people behind that person to trip and then we have an even bigger obstacle and another situation for the staff to have to deal with in addition to whatever is causing the panic. \n\nSure, maybe there\u2019s a small chance of that actually happening but it *can* happen and they probably don\u2019t want to risk you suing them when shit happened because you couldn\u2019t keep your kid out of the aisles.", "Why did they let in too many people then? I would have offered the son the chair and stood in the back if that\u2019s what others were doing. But I think the event organizers bear some responsibility to manage the attendance", "And try getting there early enough to get a chair next time. Or stand at the back with the other latecomers. YRA.", "Is your 9 yr old kid the same size as a purse?", "Then they should also make sure in those same rules that bags are to be placed under your chair and not on an unoccupied chair. That's how we get to issues like this, OP even stated that people were leaving their bags and stuff on empty chairs. Totally avoidable solution if those in charge actually cared about a solution that helped all sides", "I have several family members that are firefighters (not relevant, only stated for effect). The kid is in more danger than a purse is if people panic in a fire and run for the exit.", "YTA !!\n\nPeople in the aisle are a fire hazard & the business will be fined. Business can get huge fines for multiple instances of violations. Schools are held to an even higher standard & get bigger fines. AND IT'S JUST ALL AROUND UNSAFE. You were rude to someone who's enforcing rules that keep YOUR KIDS safe. Be a better adult", "NTA.\n\nAs someone pointed out it could be a fire-hazard thing but since we don't know that and since he's was holding your hand that should suffice. And bags are more likely a hazard, in case of emergency that get left behind and people trip. And it's a trip-hazard anyway.", "If the staff couldn't get you to remove your child from the aisle, why would they bother with handbags?\n\nBesides the fire rules, did you give any thought to how filthy that floor is?", "I first read the title as \u201cAITA for letting my son SHIT on the floor\u201d so I was very interested to see where this was going. This is a little less interesting of a story.", "Ok, OP's other account. You could have at least tried to sound a little different. So transparent.", "Just because*you* call a rule \"BS\" four times doesn't actually mean it's \"BS.\" There are tons of reasons why a child shouldn't sit on the floor in the aisle so that's not a far fetched rule a school would have, whether you like it or not.", "I think people would climb over seats too in an emergency because the stairs would be full.", "I'm intrigued... Let's see how close", "People can trip and hurt themselves as easily on a bag as a child in the rush of evacuating, maybe easier because a bag won't try to dodge away from you."]}
