He was a part of a holiday program at his school past week with his water polo team. It was during the day and me, my ex, and our younger two kids went to see it.\n\nThere were four of us but only three seats. My ex, my 12yo son and I took a seat and my 9yo Jeremy sat on my lap. After 20 minutes Jeremy came off my lap and sat on the floor next to my chair. He wasn't blocking the aisle. Ther aisles were quite spacious. Jeremy was just sitting very close to my chair and holding my hand.\n\nOut of the blue, a teacher came up to me and asked that my son not sit on the floor. I explained there were no more chairs (obviously) and he was just sitting my lap for 20 minutes.  \n\nShe repeated herself about my son sitting on the floor. I said he's not blocking anyone or anything so unless she is going to find another seat for me and him to sit together then stop pecking at me.\n\nAgain, Jeremy wasn't blocking anyone. There were staff and purses in the aisles. It was more about being a nag so I ignored her. \n\nI got an email from one of the VPs telling me that I was rude and uncooperative to his staff by letting my son sit in the aisle next to me. I said I wasn't being rude. There was no more seats and a 9yo boy is only going to sit on his dad's lap for so long. \n\nAgain, yes , Jeremy sitting in the aisle next to my chair holding my hand or recording my other son with my phone. But he was NOT blocking anyone from passing. People put their bags and purses in the aisle by their chair and took up more space than my son. This wasn't a safety issue. It was being a nag. I wouldn't put my son in a position where he's going to trip people or get hit in the face by a bag or stepped on. Get real.\n\nI did reply back to the VP and never heard back so it obviously became a non-issue.", "created_utc": 1671803484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztg0lp/aita_for_letting_son_sit_on_the_floor/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had other options.", "YTA\n\nIt's a fire hazard.  You may think the aisle was \"quite spacious,\" but a fire inspector may disagree.  \n\nVery secondarily, it's just not okay to have your child sit in an aisle where other people are walking.", "YTA, Their venue, their rules, end of story.", "YTA. They can't let people sit in the aisle. Fire codes prohibit this. Sure, they should have found an extra chair, but you still ignored what you were being told for good reason.", "Good job teaching your 9yo that authority figures don't matter.  YTA", "YTA.\n\nI was leaning N T A as I don't see where the teacher offered a solution i.e. finding another chair or pointing you to an area where your child could sit.\n\nThat said, 'stop pecking at me' is a really rude thing to say. I don't think it where called for; you also didn't ask the teacher for an alternative solution. Calling the teacher a 'nag' in your post...your attitude is giving me serious AH vibes.\n\nAlso, the aisle absolutely is a safety issue. A bag is not the same as a 9 year old child; in an emergency, I don't care how many bags get trampled but I, and my insurance, would certainly care about a 9 year old.", "YTA. You could have let your 9yo sit with his brother and mom and either stood in the back or found a solo seat for yourself. You could even have asked the teacher to find you a seat. I don't understand why you had to insist on finding two seats together.", "YTA. Your tone and wording like \u201cpecking\u201d and \u201cbeing a nag\u201d reeks of misogyny (yes you can be a misogynist if you\u2019re female). Gross entitled behavior and horrid example for your child. YTA.", "You were kind of rude and you talk about nagging, which feels like a gendered way to belittle the woman asking your son to move. \n\nBecause of that, YTA", "Unless your 9 year old child is the size of a handbag, YTA.", "YTA. It\u2019s not about blocking the aisle as much as your son potentially being stepped on during an emergency.  It\u2019s also an issue because any teacher knows that if one kid gets to do something then eventually you\u2019re going to be dealing with a bunch of others who want to know why they can\u2019t do the same. The teacher is thinking about the big picture, you are thinking about your own individual situation. \n\nBut really, the issue here is that your first instinct was to argue. You had other options. You could have let your son have your seat and gone to stand in the back. You could have split your seats before the program even started.  But no, you had to be right and get your way.", "YTA stand up and give your child your seat, then. Teaching your kids that you\u2019re entitled to do what you want and don\u2019t have to respect the rules of other people and places when imposing upon them is a horrible message to send. You were asked politely to follow the rules and acted entitled as a result", "YTA. You\u2019re just a person who thinks rules don\u2019t apply to you & expects people to make exceptions for your immediate convenience. Your kid & all the other kids who want to sit on the aisles are a fire hazard not to mention generally in the way of people who want to walk in the aisles. If your kid gets to sit in the aisle, then how about the next kid who wants to sit there & the 30 after him? You\u2019re not special. You don\u2019t get to break the rules that every one else has to follow.", "YTA. I get there wasn\u2019t a seat. But I can hear it in your Karenlike tone. There are safety rules. You were rude and entitled. VP called you out, and you justify it. You do owe some apologies. You do.", "YTA for the situation at hand and now a bigger AH for the way you are acting in the comments. Why come to reddit and ask us for our judgement, than just double down and argue with everyone. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be raising children, you have the maturity of a 10 year old.. feel sorry for those poor kids.", "YTA. It\u2019s a fire hazard", "YTA- I know you think the aisles are large enough, but it\u2019s a safety hazard, pure and simple", "ESH\n\nThis is likely a risk situation  - you should have taken it more seriously. Staff are there to supervise this risk.\n\nThey should have offered alternatives or only given out a certain number of tickets if the venue could only hold a certain number of people, clearly they were unprepared.", "Either get their earlier so you can get more seats or get your kid off the stairs. You\u2019re a grown ass man & these facts should be common sense - YTA", "YTA", "YTA:  It doesn't matter why they asked your son to move, it matters that they asked him. Not only did you refuse, you were arrogant about it. They don't have to find you seats. You could have come earlier to the event if you all wanted to sit together to ensure this. And, now, that people have called you out about it, you are once again being arrogant that you were right. Why bother to ask the question because in your mind you already know the answer. The school personnel asked your son to move. They are responsible for **ALL the children,** not just your child.", "YTA.\n\nWhen there aren't enough seats the overflow always stand at the back or sit at the very edges on the exterior sides of the room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've never seen anyone actually sit in the aisle.", "NTA. The teacher made a request, you responded, and seeing as the request could not be fulfilled (no additional chair was provided) that\u2019s the end of that. The teacher obviously complained to VP, but like you said it\u2019s a non-issue and they saw it from your reply. Who knows how that teacher painted it for the VP.", "NTA. \n\nIncidentally , I love it when teachers run into adults that don\u2019t immediately do why they tell them to like their students do.

You just taught him that rules only apply when you feel like they do. The very definition of entitlement behavior. You feel entitled to do what you want, as long as YOU don't see a problem with it.
