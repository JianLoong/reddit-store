{"id": 14196, "submission_id": "12e3ql7", "title": "AITA for having completely different standards for my daughter and stepdaughter despite them being the same age?", "selftext": "My wife and I each have a daughter from previous relationships, both of whom are 17. \n\nMy daughter lives with us and has since we got married 10 years ago. My wife's daughter Marci (fake name) never has. The full story of what happened is very long, but the short hand is that despite almost 16 years of legal battles, court filings and CPS investigations, my wife was never able to get custody or even consistent visits. There were a few orders on her side at points, but enforcing them was impossible. It sounds like an excuse, I know, but it's really not. \n\nThings came to a head (again) last fall and Marci was presented with an opportunity to either sit patiently for my wife to pull another filing together and roll the dice again, or emancipate herself. She decided she wanted emancipation. My wife decided to back it because, and it blows my mind that this was the case, emancipation had the better chance of winning, and Marci gave the impression that she was using this as the way to get away from her father and would want to come live with her.\n\nShe had no intention of this, but it finally opened the door for them to talk, and now she's coming to visit for 3 weeks this summer. Should be great, but now we have a conflict with my daughter. For obvious reasons, we can't have any of the kind of rules that we would have if she was a child in our house. If it's not something that would be a problem for an adult guest to do, I just have to let it go. Of course I think that a 17 year old smoking is a huge deal,  but I can't fight about that with her. I can just say not to smoke indoors. Of course I don't want to also be welcoming Marci's partner to come stay with us for the trip, but that's a deal-breaker for her and my wife wants this to happen, so it's happening. \n\nMy daughter is pissed because, in her words, she's seeing someone that's literally two months younger than her be held to a completely different standard. Unfortunately, the reality is is that while they're both 17, Marci just isn't a child like my daughter is. We'd love to live in the world where both girls grew up living with us and we got to have the exact same standards and similar conflicts, but that's not the one we live in. I've tried explaining to her that this is an incredibly weird and difficult situation and that honestly this can't be compared to a normal family because it just isn't, but she's not having any of that. I tried to tell her to just pretend that Marci is in her 20s and is an adoptee that's reuniting with her birth mother, because that's the closest scenario I can think of to this, and that made my wife start crying and now she's mad at me too and everyone is fighting. I don't really see what could do differently. This just kind of has to be what it is, and they won't accept it.", "created_utc": 1680827872, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12e3ql7/aita_for_having_completely_different_standards/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If Marci is legally considered an adult by the courts after proving that she is fully capable of supporting herself and she is better off without parents then you are right, Marci is not a child and gets to live how she wants (within the bounds of the place she is residing of course).", "INFO: what, precisely, does your daughter want to do that your stepdaughter is allowed to do?", "NTA Tell your daughter that if she wants to get emancipated, she's welcome to talk to a judge about it. Of course, that means paying her own rent, cell phone, car, college, clothes, vacations, other nice things that you can't afford as an emancipated teenager. \n\nYes, there are privileges to being treated as an adult, but having a functional family that provides for you is nice too.", "NAH. You're all dealing with a complicated, emotionally fraught situation. I think you should try to explain again that there's a difference between guests and residents but not muddle the topic with age or loaded language about family. Apologize to your wife. I understand and agree with what you were trying to express, but I also understand why it would be hurtful to her.\n\nAs for your daughter, I don't think she's TA as long as you sort this out before Marci comes. I have a few guesses about what she may be feeling. First is that she could be projecting some anxiety about the fact that she'll become a legal adult soon, perhaps feeling under-prepared in contrast to Marci who is already self-sufficient. Second is that for one reason or another she might've already felt that you were treating her as younger than her age and the situation with Marci simply brought it to the forefront.\n\nThird, and here's where you may potentially be TA, how much input did your daughter get in planning Marci's visit? Have you given her the chance to set boundaries about what she's comfortable with? Does she feel pressured to view Marci as a sister? Moving two strangers--unfortunately, that's probably what Marci is to your daughter, or an acquaintance at best,--into the house for three weeks is a big deal. I'm not saying your daughter should get a flat veto or that it's the case here, but oftentimes parents unfairly shift the brunt of inconvenience and discomfort onto their children. Some hypothetical examples are expecting her to set her schedule around Marci and the partner or to share personal spaces with them. Your daughter may have deeper concerns about the arrangement that she doesn't feel permitted to say so she's beating around the bush with the topic of age.", "ESH\n\nThis is a great way to ensure the girls pretty much hate eachother. Congrats! Also you really hurt your wife by implying her girl is adopted thus not really hers. \n\nA way to avoid this would be to find out what your 17 yr old almost adult anyways daughter wants to do. Then negotiate. \n\nSex? Get her an iud and a big bag of condoms make her swear up and down til she's blue to use them Everytime. No matter if a doofus says he doesn't like the feel. \n\nSmoking, your other girl can't buy a pack herself so unless you are supplying well, nah. Some for booze. \n\nGrowing and using a lil mj? It's reasonable to say not in my house if it's illegal and could risk you. If not relax a teen won't have enough money to actually grow much.", "INFO - The two examples that you give regard smoking and having her partner with her, which one of these is your daughter the upset about or is there something else that she's looking for the ability to do that you don't allow her to?", "INFO what happened between Marci and your wife that she lost custody and visitation for so many years?", "ESH, I think... You're only the ass a bit for how you talked about it in front of your wife, mostly. I'd definitely encourage you to talk with her and get a gauge on how you can help her feel better about the way you handled this and what she might rather you consider saying or doing instead in that moment so you can figure out a way to address it better in the future.\n\nIn regards to your daughter... children, especially teenagers, are often obsessed with the concept of fairness at least in their own home, I think because children often are exposed to a lot more unfairness outside of home than our society is willing to admit so it becomes all the more important in the place they feel safest. This isn't to say I think your daughter should be able to smoke or have a date around or anything so much as an explanation.\n\nI'm genuinely curious as to what it is exactly that your daughter wants to do but can't at home? Is it smoking or being able to have a date over? Is it something else? What privileges is it that she wants that she can't have exactly? Depending on what they are, maybe there's room to be more flexible than what we can see here, but it's hard to guess without knowing exactly what it is your daughter wants.", "INFO\n\nDoes your daughter want to smoke/vape?\n\nDoes she have a bf/gf? Is she having sex with them?\n\nIt's clear that, because of Marci's upbringing, she engages in various \"adult\" activities that you'd rather she didn't, and you don't want your daughter to do. Does your daughter actually want to do these things? What boundaries does your daughter actually want you to relax?", "Info: What does Marci being emancipated have to do with respecting the rules in your home. I'm adult and I don't allow guest to smoke in my home. I don't care how old they are. If your in the US you are not allowed to drink until your 21 being emanicipated doesn't change that. 18 year olds are legal adults  who can join the military but they still aren't legally allowed to drink in the US until they turn 21. Maybe you don't live in the US so that isn't issue for you. Also her being legally eminanicpated has nothing to do with her partner being allowed to stay in your home. Again I'm an adult and if I don't want someone staying in my home they won't be staying in my home. So please stop using her being eminacipted as the excuse for why she will be allowed to do these things. You are allowing her o do it because your wife wants her to come visit and Marci said it is a deal breaker if you don't allow her to do these things. It is what is but be honest with your daughter. This has nothing to do with her being eminicaptied. Her being being eminicpated allows her to make choice of whether or not she comes to visit without needing her father's permission. Her being emincipatied does not mean she gets to do what she wants in someone else home. Adults are still required to respect other people's rules when they are a guest in someone else's home.", "NTA. This is a pretty tough spot to be in. Marci knows she has the power in this relationship and she's flexing her muscles for sure. I would love an update after the 3 week visit, as I'm sure it will not go smoothly for any of you.", "NTA but to be perfectly blunt, you are opening Pandora's box by bringing these 2 together. I would drum up a plan for your daughter to visit family/go to camp/ whatever, during the visit, and keep them apart as long as possible.", "NTA, but it sounds like your daughter has had an entirely different upbringing.  \n\nPerhaps you should highlight the ways you ARE treating them the same.\n\nYou give them both the compassion they need.\nYou meet them both where they are, hoping the best for them.\nYou accept their faults, and want to help them improve. \n\nYou get what I'm saying?   Like - yea the standard is the \"rule\" of no smoking, no sleepovers or whatever - but that's the implementation of desire of the heart for that person.  You desire the best for both your daughters. \n\nFailing that - call your daughters bluff.  Tell her she can smoke and that she can have her boyfriend for a sleepover.   My gut says she won't actually do it cause she was raised better.", "nah\n\nthis is a really tough situation\u2014there\u2019s no perfect way to handle it because it\u2019s the result of shitty circumstances. you might think about using a family therapist. you all care about each other, you just don\u2019t have the map to navigate this situation and having a navigator to help get to the other side could be really helpful!", "Well, your daughter is going to hate Marci on sight, she is going to hate your wife and she is going to hate you.\n\nYou consider it acceptable to, metaphorically, straightjacket and/or imprison your own daughter while expecting her to be happy that someone who is younger than her can shag her way through her three week stay, smoke until her lungs bleed and have freedoms that she can only dream of once she leaves home and you **EXPECT** (your words) her to keep days free for fun, family, bonding activities. Read that sentence again and ask yourself: \"What are the chances that my daughter is going to want ANY relationship with Marci?\" Or you, for that matter.\n\nI do not envy your situation at all but the entire emotional cost of this whole sorry mess is to be laid at your daughter's feet. And she deserves none of it\n\nYou are the one setting the double standards. You can solve it if only during the periods that Marci stays with you.

But YWBTA if you're supplying a physical child drugs and alcohol.", "NTA - I don\u2019t think the way you worded it, with pretending that Marci is an adoptee, was the best way to word it, especially with your wife present. I understand why she would be hurt by that, though I also understand that you were trying to help your own daughter realize why things are so different.\n\nHave you talked with your wife about what would be the best way to help your daughter understand the situation? She may be able to help you think of a better way to get her to understand. Marci\u2019s life and emancipation have nothing to do with your daughter; I understand that it may be odd to see someone that is her peer being treated as an adult, but at the same time the concept isn\u2019t wholly different than what is taught to elementary school students. \u201cFair doesn\u2019t mean everyone gets the same thing, fair means everyone gets their needs met.\u201d\n\nMarci grew up in a way where she needed to be emancipated and become an adult earlier than she needed to.\n\nYour daughter grew up in a way that guaranteed her safety and stability and is able to continue to live as the minor she is.\n\nDifferent life circumstances cause different outcomes for different people.", "NTA, and your daughter has to understand that her situation is completely different from your stepdaughter.

Being treated to blatantly unfairly by your parent sticks with you.", "NAH. Man that sounds like a mess, sorry. I think if there\u2019s some way to emphasize to your bio daughter that she is actually lucky to have rules and restrictions, even if it feels unfair, that it means she has grown up in a loving, responsible household, and even if it seems like her stepsister has more freedoms, it\u2019s not really a good thing and the result of an unfortunate situation.", "NTA\n\nYou need to continue having conversations with your daughter about why Marci\u2019s situation is different. Include that legally Marci **is an adult** and that this makes things different. Help your daughter understand that you and your wife are trying to build a relationship with Marci and are having to make compromises to do this, and are fighting hard to figure this out because you love Marci and that if your daughter was in a troubling situation you\u2019d fight just as hard for her too. Open up to your daughter about the fact that there\u2019s no playbook for parenting, and for such a unique situation, and you\u2019re just trying to figure out how to bring Marci back into the family.\n\nAlso, maybe plan some time with your daughter to show her that she\u2019s important to you. She probably feels awkward and insecure about the situation too.", "NTA although it was kind of mean to say what you did in front of your wife, it probably hurt her feelings a lot. \n\nYour daughter really needs to get it into her head that it has nothing to do with fairness. You need to have another sit down and explain that the circumstances are COMPLETELY different and she has grown up in a different household with different rules.", "I feel for your daughter, that\u2019s a tough way to learn that lesson, but it\u2019s a lesson worth learning young.

She'll act like it's the end of the world, surely, but it isn't.

The most important thing you can do is keep listening to your daughter and her concerns... try to keep that line of communication open. You can emphasize with the statement that things are unfair. However, you (and your wife) are legally responsible for your daughter in a way you aren't for Marci.  It might also be helpful to ask your daughter what she is thinking her plans will be after she turns 18, and agree to help her take steps to prepare for that. (She wants to get an apartment... great! you love her and would love for her to stay. However, if she wants to move out at 18 you will respect and fully support that that decision. You will make sure she knows how to make a budget and grocery list, etc. You will also advise that she start saving up enough $$ for first and last month's rent at the going rate in the area. She wants to go to college? great! Is she expecting you to help pay and/or live under your roof? Well then... she should be aware of  the terms and conditions that come with such support.

I say NTA but all relationships need healthy boundaries even when you're desperate for.tne person to choose you. More so then because your kids both need those skills. \"Kid we don't allow anyone to smoke indoors and you're underage. So I cannot allow you to smoke inside.\" Word it how it works for you and be gentle but firm. I will say vaping isn't necessarily on the same level but if it's cigarettes? You are also allowed boundaries for being forced to breathe second hand smoke so vaping may be a flexibility option as long as you again make sure she knows it's not Infront of you.\n\nYou're allowed to be uncomfortable with her substance use and you can still ask any guest to respect the space.

Where as for OP's daughter if she is caught doing those things her parents can enforce punishments and she cannot just leave their house because she is legally a child still.", ">I'm not sure what this means.\n\nI was using the word \"boundaries\" as a catchall for any houseguest rules she might want to negotiate, similar to how you have a no smoking in the house rule. \n\n>I don't think so. We've never called Marci her sister.\n\n>We do expect her to clear her schedule on some of those days for **family activities and time**\n\nThat's a bit of a contradiction.\n\nIt sounds like you have a decent set-up for privacy.\n\nAll that said, I'm an adult with my own place who can establish whatever rules for houseguests I feel to be necessary. I would still be hesitant and probably decline to have someone stay with me for three weeks. Living with somebody is a whole new minefield of potential conflict even when you know them well. I wouldn't let someone's SO that I'd never met stay with me unless it was an absolute emergency. Your family's relationship with Marci comes with a ton of emotional baggage on top of it. So my point is if I were a 17-year-old girl whose parents are already fighting months in advance and I get zero say in the situation, it would be *extremely* anxiety-inducing. \n\nYour plan for the summer visit is risky and imo spending time together in a lower-stakes setting first would be a better way to go. I'm concerned that there may be a belief, if not intellectually then emotionally, that these three weeks will magically make up for lost time. Frankly, you need a backup plan in case it doesn't go well.\n\nI understand why your wife is willing to bend over backwards to accommodate Marci. I understand that you're trying to support her and are caught in the middle. I understand why Marci (rightfully) expects not to be subjected to the same rules she would've been if you'd raised her. But I'm also positive there's something more to what's bothering your daughter that you don't understand yet. I haven't read through all the recent comments to see if you've already answered this, but it's a good idea to ask her whether there's something she *actually* wants to do but isn't allowed to. \n\nIn the bigger picture, she probably needs reassurance. You've got to make room for her to speak freely, though. An attitude of \"this is how it has to be\" where a single poorly worded sentence sets off a screaming match is not conducive to problem-solving and compromise. The three of you really, really need to get on the same page before Marci's visit because the situation will only get more sensitive from there.", "Why don't your daughter go and stay at her mom's house if her mom is in the picture.", "Honestly I can't imagine asking my parents to even have my SO in my room at all at 17.\n\nI would laugh in my daughter's face if she tried it.", "Again her being emanicipated has nothing to do with her respecting the rules in your home. So stop using that as the excuse. As I said even adults have to respect the rules of someone else's home when they are guest there. You and your wife are allowing her to do this because that is how badly your wife wants her daughter to come visit. The only role her being emanicpated plays is that she gets to decided whether or not to visit your wife. Why not be upfront about that with your daughter. Explained the only way Marci would be willing to visit is if she is allowed to do these things in your home and you want her to visit so badly that you are not holding her to the same standards that you would give other guest in your home like not being allowed to smoke. Stop acting like legally being an adult means you can do what ever you want in someone else's home. That is not the norm. People still have to respect other peoples rules and bourdaries when they are guest in someone else's home. I'm saying YTA   because of the excuse you keep using with your daughter. Your adults and it is your home. You get to establish the rules for guests in your home. If the guest don't like them they don't have to stay. So stop acting like you don't have a say or a choice in what goes on in your own home.", "Ask him what size condoms to get.", "So I did some of my own research, and I don't know if you're aware, but being emancipated *does not mean* that she is legally allowed to smoke or drink, so YWBTA if you allow her to even have them in your home. \n\nIf she can't obtain them legally on her own, she shouldn't have them at all, and you allowing her to expose your daughter to illegal activity isn't okay.", "With all due respect, Marci lived her whole life waiting for the legal processes to allow her mother custody. You yourself said it\u2019d be a \u201cdice roll\u201d of if her most recent file would be accepted or not. I absolutely understand why emancipation was the route she went down, and it sounds like a logical decision on her part.", "With her dad who she emancipated from and he is letting her come back.", "I'm not sure that's wise. He mouths off and she might leave. Op is not calling the shots on this one. It isn't his daughter. And she wouldn't listen anyway by the sound of it.", "She has her own housing.", "OK what does this mean? Your daughter can\u2019t hang out with her SO in her room with the door open? If that\u2019s the case no wonder why she\u2019s mad.", "But you\u2019re going to let a girl who is younger than her do that in front of her?", "Eh, I don't know about you, but I was actually pretty well behaved as a kid with my SOs in regards to being alone with them... more than a few times with no parents in the house even. I remember as a teenager feeling... weird every time I heard adults talking about how everyone expected teenagers to be hypersexual all the time, including my parents. Something about this clear vision of what they saw me as sexually felt... objectifying and like projection of their libidos, I suppose. Considering my parents had me at 18/19 respectively, that's probably not too far off the mark. The irony? I'm a late bloomer, only became 'active' in my 20s and not because of lack of access.\n\nI think we do teenagers a disservice with these assumptions based on that experience because I know I'm not the only one. I'm not saying 'let go of all rules', but that stance sounds pretty strict for someone who is 17 and about to make her way in the world and be significantly more exposed to these types of situations.", "\u201cI would laugh in my daughter's face if she tried it.\u201d\n\nYTA for this alone! Don\u2019t laugh at and ridicule your child! What\u2019s wrong with you?", "Moved in with my boyfriend's family at 16. Boyfriends parents were extremely kind about it. Some situations normal conventions just don't apply.", "The fact that you would laugh in her face but are letting Marci do the same makes YTA.", "She's already agreed not to smoke indoors. It's not the indoors that the special thing. It's that we're letting go that she's doing it at all.\n\nIt's NOT okay for kids to use nicotine.", "It seems like you keep missing the point where she's allowed to smoke outside, not in the home. A lot of parents wouldn't allow their own minor child to smoke, even outside. But if they invite their adult friend over, they'll tell them \"no smoking in here\" and they'll step outside to smoke. Marci is an adult.", "Yeah, I\u2019m gonna go with this. You aren\u2019t going about this properly. It\u2019s like Marci is making the rules and you and your wife are rolling over for whatever.", "I don't know if she drinks at all, but she won't be here. \n\nI'm not confiscating cigarettes, but I'm not buying them. I'm just not asking questions.", "It's not illegal to smoke cigarettes at 17 you just can't sell cigarettes to someone under 21. It's actually illegal for someone under 21 to drink alcohol.", "That definitely. \n\nWhat I meant is that we would have been happy to view the emancipation as the technicality to bring her home. She didn't need to actually live as an adult. That she chose to do.", "No? She's not in contact with him. Her living situation is completely separate.", "Going \"This is the expectations of any guest\" isn't mouthing off. It's what healthy adults do. It's also a show of respect because it's not pandering to her as if she's a.fragile deer going to flee in terror.", "Tell her there\u2019s no smoking on your property, if it bothers you. You\u2019re allowed to set that rule.", "Ah, I see. That makes sense then. I understand your perspective here, though at the same time it seems natural for her to experiment with this new sense of independence and live life as the adult she legally is now.\n\nIt really is an awkward and delicate situation. I wish you and your wife patience in navigating this, I know it can\u2019t be easy."]}
