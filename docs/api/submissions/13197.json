We had dinner, chatted, and then towards the end of the night our boss passed around envelopes (with our cash in it). I had set mine down on the table next to my purse. Just before leaving I told my boyfriend I was going to use the restroom which was downstairs. When I came out of the restroom he was waiting outside the door with my purse ready to leave- so we said our goodbyes and left. It wasn't until we were halfway home that I realized he had grabbed my purse but not my envelope. I asked if he had grabbed it and he said \"shoot I didn't\". No big deal, I forgot too. So I called the restaurant and they did not pick up as they were closed. No problem, I would call the next day. \n\nI called in the morning and it went straight to voicemail. So I left a message. \"Hi this is so-and-so from (insert company name) dinner party from last night. I think I left something there so if you could give me a call back that would be great.\" Several hours later they called. I described the envelope size and color (it was red - very noticeable) and where I was sitting and where I thought I had left it. Then I asked if they had seen it. They replied with \"Nope haven't seen it.\" and hung up on me. \n\nThat phone call made me feel very uneasy. Why would they hang up on me? Not only is it rude but it made me suspicious. So, during my lunch break, I went down to the restaurant and told them the situation and how the phone call made me uncomfortable. I asked why they hung up on me and they denied it. I just brushed it off because it wasn't worth arguing over. So I asked if there was a way I could watch the surveillance footage just to see what happened to the envelope or if the waitress accidentally threw it away ( I worked in a law firm for several years so I understand that they are not obligated to show me, I just thought I would ask because this was not just $5 - it was a decent amount). \n\nThey snickered and said \"Not for you to watch\" and asked me to leave the restaurant because they aren't \"interested in being accused of something they didn't do\". I left and immediately called my boss to tell him the situation. He called down to the restaurant and several hours later my envelope was found and I got my money back. When I went to pick up the envelope they said \"Our employees had to dumpster dive to get this back for you\" almost as if they were trying to guilt trip me? (Maybe that is just in my head but it seemed that way because I never asked them to go to those extreme measures - just wanted to see the footage). \n\nSo AITA for requesting to see the security footage?", "created_utc": 1679786156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1222vek/aita_for_requesting_to_see_the_security_footage/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA.  The restaurant staff is not responsible to secure your valuables that you have sitting on the table with you.  It is very likely that the envelope would have ended up in the trash.  But that's not the restaurant's problem.  It's OK to call the restaurant to inquire about if an envelope was found.  It's not OK to expect the restaurant employees to go to extraordinary measures to try to find the envelope.\n\nNow, if I was the restaurant manager, I would deny the request to review the security camera footage, as that can take many hours.  There are often several cameras that view any particular spot, and you would not have a clear time-frame to look for.  So you might need to review an hour or so on several cameras.  I don't have time for that when I have a restaurant to run....and I sure as heck aint turning over the operation of my security system to a customer.\n\nIf you requested to search the trash bin, I would be inclined to let you do that, as long as you agreed to pick up any mess you make in the process.\n\nAsking my employees to dumpster dive?  That's above and beyond.  Operating a restaurant is a fast-paced environment.  Nobody has time to dumpster dive.  If they do, it is likely that the business is failing.", "NTA Someone on their staff stole the money and they knew it. But part of this is your fault. You carelessly put the money beside your purse and inside. Then you left both purse and money unattended while you went to the restroom. Someone knew what was in those envelopes and waited for an opportunity. Unfortunately without realizing it you gave them that opportunity.", "NTA. \n\nyour request contained the magic words, though! Glad you got it back. And I'm so glad your boss added their request to yours.", "NTA. They stole knew corporate would release the footage if properly asked so gave it back.", "NTA. Their employees didn't dumpster dive, I'd bet they copped to it when they realized you weren't going to leave it alone.", "NTA at all, not even close. But maybe your boss should think about giving checks in the future. Handing out envelopes of cash is just making targets of employees.", "Nta obviously they were lying. You wouldn't throw away an obviously sealed envelope with your name on it.  Hopefully the company won't go there again.", "These were my thoughts exactly. I came here to say this, but glad I read down a bit first.", "No - I was trying to be careful not to say anything accusatory because I know that just puts people on the defensive. But that's why I'm here. I feel like asking for the footage made it seem like I was accusing them.", "For sure - it's their legal right to refuse.", "Well, of course. No one else's fault but my own.", "I wouldn't have either. So I don't expect others to for me.", "I left it with my boyfriend at the table where everyone was still sitting with the intention of coming back upstairs to grab it and even sit back down to finish my drink. While I was in the bathroom everyone was getting up and leaving. But I hear what you are saying - I learned my lesson nonetheless.", "To be very clear- I did not ask them to dumpster dive nor expect them too. I wouldn't have done it myself so why should I expect others to do it for me? I also did not expect them to say yes to the security footage, but thought it would be silly not for me to at least ask.", "No. If I was on shift and someone asked to see footage so they could see where their envelope with a large amount of cash went, I would think they just want to know where it went not that they\u2019re accusing me. \nThey probably reacted like that because they had the envelope and didn\u2019t want to say anything. The way they went about it just screams guilt.", ">Our employees had to dumpster dive to get this back for you.\n\nSo did the money smell, was the envelope dirty? I can't imagine someone would dumpster dive for it. 'I'm sorry, it looks like the envelope was thrown out as trash. We cant show you the video but you can have your lawyers request and review the footage. Sorry for your misfortune.'\n\nIf they found it, I am 100% certain someone took it and it was caught on camera.", "Tbh I'm kind of imagining a situation where someone either scooped up a whole disposable tablecloth and threw it away or just swept everything into a bag... I only say this because I've done that exact thing cleaning up after parties at an old job. And I mean if that WAS the case I'd be mad too. I can absolutely see a boss telling an employee to crawl into the dumpster for you. Customer service sucks and honestly you should be more careful, especially with a whole bonus of cash.", "I wonder if your boss applied some pressure?", "I just pointed that out because in today's day and age we have to be extra vigilant with protecting things. Now as far as if you're the asshole or not, I don't think you are but you might be for expecting them to agree to you watching it. I believe footage can only be watched by management of the restaurant and potentially law enforcement agents for crimes.", "I'm just really glad you got it back. There's for sure no way an employee didn't see that envelope, look in it, and swipe it. Seeing some of the other comments and how quickly the envelope was produced, I'm questioning if it actually was thrown away.\n\nWhen you got it back, did it look like it had been in a dumpster with trash? Cause if it wasn't, then that's a whole different story. Lol", "Another coworker might have picked it up either thinking it was theirs or knowing it wasn't.  The restaurant's response makes them seem guilty.", "And if the boss is telling the truth, they threw the employee into a dumpster.", "It had one small smear on it. But honestly, no. It didn\u2019t look like it had been through the trash or dumpster. Also- maybe I should add this- my mom owns a business that shares the same alleyway as this business (where all the city dumpsters are). And the dumpster trash had been collected by the trucks that morning.", "Well that's honestly why I asked to see the footage. If it had been scooped up and thrown away then I know I am not getting it back and that's just that. I'll deal with the consequences - but you don't know until you know. Could have just fallen onto the floor even?", "I'm not sure. It's possible, as I was not listening to the conversation so I wouldn't know for sure what was said.", "I didn't expect them to show me. Like I mentioned in my post, I worked in a law firm for years and understand they have no legal obligation to show me. But I did know that asking never hurts - at least I thought.", "It had one small smear on it. But didn\u2019t look like it was in a large restaurant\u2019s dumpster. No grease marks or anything.", "I'm glad you got everything back", "Well the good news is at least you got your money back. For most people, it wouldn't be a happy ending", "If you have worked at a law firm for years, then you should understand that even asking that question in the first place is ridiculous. I understand that you want to try and make sure that you can find your bonus money, but unfortunately asking them for permission to view their cameras could put them at a lot of risks as well. For example, if the general manager says it's okay but the district manager throws a fit about it, you just call someone their job. \nNot to mention, they have absolutely no idea how you're going to react if they tell you no. For all they know, they might have to call cops because you didn't do a good job at keeping track of your stuff, and might go berserk on them.\nIf anything, you probably should have just gone to your boss in the first place, and all of this could have been avoided. Or, next time make sure you keep track of your stuff. Put it in your bag, or make sure that your partner has it on them. Stick it in your coat pocket, or if your outfit or your partner is outfit has pockets, put the envelope in one of those. there are about probably four or five different ways you could have handled this, to avoid the situation in the first place, and probably about two or three other ways you could have handled it after the fact.\nI'm not going to say that you're the a******, but neither are they. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "Oh they for sure swiped it then. You're not the asshole in this case at all. But I'm still giving you the side eye for not putting that cash straight into your purse.

People have asked me to view our security footage at my company, and I know people sometimes get angry when I say no. But that is why managers exist. To descalate situations like that. Although, I would never throw a fit or demand anything- no means no.\n\nAlso this wasn\u2019t a large corporation. It\u2019s a local steakhouse. I don\u2019t think there are district managers and all that.", "Well to be fair the envelope didn\u2019t fit in my purse 100% lol. I have one of those smaller purses with the long straps\u2026 if that makes sense", "Oooh that makes sense. Girl roll those bills up and stuff them in it next time! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
