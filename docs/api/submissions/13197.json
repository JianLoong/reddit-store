We had dinner, chatted, and then towards the end of the night our boss passed around envelopes (with our cash in it). I had set mine down on the table next to my purse. Just before leaving I told my boyfriend I was going to use the restroom which was downstairs. When I came out of the restroom he was waiting outside the door with my purse ready to leave- so we said our goodbyes and left. It wasn't until we were halfway home that I realized he had grabbed my purse but not my envelope. I asked if he had grabbed it and he said \"shoot I didn't\". No big deal, I forgot too. So I called the restaurant and they did not pick up as they were closed. No problem, I would call the next day. \n\nI called in the morning and it went straight to voicemail. So I left a message. \"Hi this is so-and-so from (insert company name) dinner party from last night. I think I left something there so if you could give me a call back that would be great.\" Several hours later they called. I described the envelope size and color (it was red - very noticeable) and where I was sitting and where I thought I had left it. Then I asked if they had seen it. They replied with \"Nope haven't seen it.\" and hung up on me. \n\nThat phone call made me feel very uneasy. Why would they hang up on me? Not only is it rude but it made me suspicious. So, during my lunch break, I went down to the restaurant and told them the situation and how the phone call made me uncomfortable. I asked why they hung up on me and they denied it. I just brushed it off because it wasn't worth arguing over. So I asked if there was a way I could watch the surveillance footage just to see what happened to the envelope or if the waitress accidentally threw it away ( I worked in a law firm for several years so I understand that they are not obligated to show me, I just thought I would ask because this was not just $5 - it was a decent amount). \n\nThey snickered and said \"Not for you to watch\" and asked me to leave the restaurant because they aren't \"interested in being accused of something they didn't do\". I left and immediately called my boss to tell him the situation. He called down to the restaurant and several hours later my envelope was found and I got my money back. When I went to pick up the envelope they said \"Our employees had to dumpster dive to get this back for you\" almost as if they were trying to guilt trip me? (Maybe that is just in my head but it seemed that way because I never asked them to go to those extreme measures - just wanted to see the footage). \n\nSo AITA for requesting to see the security footage?\n\nEdit: the question I am getting asked the most is \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you just put it in your purse\u201d\u2026 well I tried. It didn\u2019t fit properly. I have a cross body purse that is small. So I put it next to my purse so i would not forget it and so that it wouldnt just fall out of my purse. but i didnt get a chance to go back upstairs because everyone was leaving. my boyfriend grabbed my things so i didnt think twice (although i should have). Also, i was not about to just take the money out in front of my coworkers and put the bills in my purse and leave the card out. I dont even know if they got the same amount as me. Too awkward - i dont like opening money cards in front of people.", "created_utc": 1679786156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1222vek/aita_for_requesting_to_see_the_security_footage/", "score": 432, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The restaurant staff is not responsible to secure your valuables that you have sitting on the table with you.  It is very likely that the envelope would have ended up in the trash.  But that's not the restaurant's problem.  It's OK to call the restaurant to inquire about if an envelope was found.  It's not OK to expect the restaurant employees to go to extraordinary measures to try to find the envelope.\n\nNow, if I was the restaurant manager, I would deny the request to review the security camera footage, as that can take many hours.  There are often several cameras that view any particular spot, and you would not have a clear time-frame to look for.  So you might need to review an hour or so on several cameras.  I don't have time for that when I have a restaurant to run....and I sure as heck aint turning over the operation of my security system to a customer.\n\nIf you requested to search the trash bin, I would be inclined to let you do that, as long as you agreed to pick up any mess you make in the process.\n\nAsking my employees to dumpster dive?  That's above and beyond.  Operating a restaurant is a fast-paced environment.  Nobody has time to dumpster dive.  If they do, it is likely that the business is failing.", "NTA Someone on their staff stole the money and they knew it. But part of this is your fault. You carelessly put the money beside your purse and inside. Then you left both purse and money unattended while you went to the restroom.

Glad you got it back. And I'm so glad your boss added their request to yours.", "NTA. They stole knew corporate would release the footage if properly asked so gave it back.", "NTA. Their employees didn't dumpster dive, I'd bet they copped to it when they realized you weren't going to leave it alone.", "NTA at all, not even close. But maybe your boss should think about giving checks in the future. Handing out envelopes of cash is just making targets of employees.", "Nta obviously they were lying. You wouldn't throw away an obviously sealed envelope with your name on it.  Hopefully the company won't go there again.", "These were my thoughts exactly. I came here to say this, but glad I read down a bit first.", "No - I was trying to be careful not to say anything accusatory because I know that just puts people on the defensive. But that's why I'm here. I feel like asking for the footage made it seem like I was accusing them.", "For sure - it's their legal right to refuse.", "Well, of course. No one else's fault but my own.", "I wouldn't have either. So I don't expect others to for me.", "I left it with my boyfriend at the table where everyone was still sitting with the intention of coming back upstairs to grab it and even sit back down to finish my drink.

I only say this because I've done that exact thing cleaning up after parties at an old job. And I mean if that WAS the case I'd be mad too. I can absolutely see a boss telling an employee to crawl into the dumpster for you.

Now as far as if you're the asshole or not, I don't think you are but you might be for expecting them to agree to you watching it. I believe footage can only be watched by management of the restaurant and potentially law enforcement agents for crimes.", "I'm just really glad you got it back. There's for sure no way an employee didn't see that envelope, look in it, and swipe it.

The restaurant's response makes them seem guilty.", "And if the boss is telling the truth, they threw the employee into a dumpster.", "It had one small smear on it. But honestly, no. It didn\u2019t look like it had been through the trash or dumpster. Also- maybe I should add this- my mom owns a business that shares the same alleyway as this business (where all the city dumpsters are). And the dumpster trash had been collected by the trucks that morning.", "Well that's honestly why I asked to see the footage. If it had been scooped up and thrown away then I know I am not getting it back and that's just that. I'll deal with the consequences - but you don't know until you know. Could have just fallen onto the floor even?", "I'm not sure. It's possible, as I was not listening to the conversation so I wouldn't know for sure what was said.", "I didn't expect them to show me. Like I mentioned in my post, I worked in a law firm for years and understand they have no legal obligation to show me.

I understand that you want to try and make sure that you can find your bonus money, but unfortunately asking them for permission to view their cameras could put them at a lot of risks as well. For example, if the general manager says it's okay but the district manager throws a fit about it, you just call someone their job. \nNot to mention, they have absolutely no idea how you're going to react if they tell you no. For all they know, they might have to call cops because you didn't do a good job at keeping track of your stuff, and might go berserk on them.\nIf anything, you probably should have just gone to your boss in the first place, and all of this could have been avoided. Or, next time make sure you keep track of your stuff. Put it in your bag, or make sure that your partner has it on them. Stick it in your coat pocket, or if your outfit or your partner is outfit has pockets, put the envelope in one of those. there are about probably four or five different ways you could have handled this, to avoid the situation in the first place, and probably about two or three other ways you could have handled it after the fact.\nI'm not going to say that you're the a******, but neither are they. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "Oh they for sure swiped it then.

Hell I\u2019ve dug through garbages before for customers who have lost valuables, and it\u2019s been a common thing among past workplaces as well. \n\nBut we also employ teenagers the answer phones and don\u2019t always know how to interact with these situations. \nYou got your money back so all good, I also wouldn\u2019t let a customer check our security footage..", "NTA but you can fold envelopes and it isn't wise to leave money sitting around like that.

I don\u2019t know what your boss said, but I strongly suspect the card was the only thing in the dumpster, they had to put the cash back from whoever pocketed it.", "NTA\n\nWhat were you suppose to do?
