My grandma told me she made a lot of those comments after I moved in with my dad.\n\nSince Ava is a single mom she's working and not in college now and apparently some afternoons she has no one to take care of Emmi so my mom decided I should be the one to do it since I finish school the hours she needs someone. Both my mom and Ava told me I needed to do it and I told them I wouldn't and when that didn't work and they pressed the issue, I told dad, who told mom to back off.

Not you baby and no relationship with baby mom. Enjoy your life and don\u2019t worry about them.", "NTA. Tell you mom that maybe you should take this in front of the judge. Because its a form of abuse to make you into a slave worker for your mom and her stepdaughter.'\n\nEdit: Hang in there. Less than 2 years till you are free from them.", "NTA.  You told them no & that should be enough.  You don't owe them an explanation.  It does not show that you hate the baby.  There is nothing wrong with standing up for yourself.  They clearly weren't listening when you said no, so you spoke up & told them to fuck off.  Of course they heard that!  You stood up for yourself.  You didn't do anything wrong.", "Sometimes you have to shout to be heard.", "NTA and threaten to call CPS for child abandonment if they ding-dong-baby-ditch you.", "I'd only feel interested in gaining a niece if my mother had bothered to gain a daughter or step sister had been interested in a sister first. Without those pre existing bonds, no thank you", "Yeah, the entitlement would have been enough for me to say no, even if they were paying.", "I don't think any of them are involved.", "Dad would be punished. Unlikely he'd end up in jail but they could transfer custody and have said they would if we didn't comply.", "This wouldn't be enough with our courts and our judge. He was very specific about what it would take to remove the contact with my mom and this is nowhere near that.", "I wouldn't get any of that but even if I did, I don't want them to be part of my life.", "I would never go to them for help. Mom has never been reliable and Ava would never help me. She'd laugh in my face if I asked her for help.", "Not for them.", "When the complete sentence  \"no\" doesn't work, \"Fuck Off\" is a great follow up", "Especially when your a child who\u2019s own parent doesnt listen to her wants/needs/desires.", "Don\u2019t even threaten. Might give them the idea. If they ding-dong-baby-ditch you, call the cops immediately.", "Hang in you only have about 24 months before you can tell the world to F off", "Is there any way to see a different judge instead? \n\nYou're 16 so old enough to make your own decisions regarding the custody agreements. Maybe work with a.\"compromise\" in that you will have some contact with your mom, under the proviso that your step family are not to be present whilst doing so?", "Where is her baby daddy and his family in all of this?", "You are such a bright girl especially for your age. Stick to your guns and try to record anything that they do, aka gaslighting and guilt tripping. Hopefully then if you ever leave, show the judge what your sick mom does and it might help you leave earlier. You also my dear need to prepare your life for going NC. Your mom and Ava are bitches.", "Not just them.\n\nAnybody.", "No, that's a really complicated thing to do and by the time we might be successful, I would probably have already turned 18.\n\nOur contact is all over the phone. I don't need to go to her house but I can't block her and act like she doesn't exist in terms of phone contact. So I need to let her call and text and a specific number of times a week I need to give some kind of reply.", "I don't really know. I don't think he's involved at all.", "I would go to my friends or other family for help but I'd also gladly help them.", "OK so that's something positive in that your contact has been court ordered to be via telephone but your mom is trying to break this by pressuring you to be present to babysit for Ava's child. Your mom could very well be using this as an attempt to get you in person for more in-person contact, which would be breaching the rules set out by the judge.\n\nPlease ensure that you follow up calls between yourself and your mother with text messages summarising what was discussed, with her needing to confirm your summary is correct. This acts as written evidence of what your mom is trying to do. \n\nAt no point in the court ordered agreement does it stipulate involving stepfamily in these phone calls, nor attending in person. So, your mom is basically using babysitting as a means to try and circumvent a legal requirement. \n\nI'm not sure which country you are in but where I live, your dad would be able to challenge this.", "Just give her a generic reply. Nope. Nada. No.", "Good grief.  No way.  Stay strong.  I\u2019m glad your dad is on your side and your contact with your mother is via phone, etc.  \n\nI\u2019ve read stories where the older person starts leaving their child and it turns into dropping the kid off on Friday and disappearing until Sunday night or Monday morning\u2026and they end up pregnant again!  Not a chance.", "I'm in the US but we're in a small rural place where the court is small and we don't have a lot of choices for judges. They also frown heavily on low contact within families so it was lucky my dad got custody initially. It would be impossible to get this to work in our favor since the judge will say I should have a relationship with them anyway.", "I understand. It's really tricky and I'm so sorry you've been put in this position.\n\nMy best advice, considering the information provided, would be... every time your mom brings it up, say \"Mom, I am not going to babysit for Ava. I am a minor and I am uncomfortable with this request. The more you pressure me to do this, the worse our relationship is going to be. If you want to have a better relationship with me, then you need to respect my boundaries and put your own child before Ava's. This is not up for discussion and this phone call will not be going any further if you don't drop this.\""]}
