Keep playing that music until he starts giving you a cut of his profits.", "NTA. You are in fact, a hero.", "NTA. He is..for filming you when you don't want to be, and for his unfunny pranks. Messing with school stuff like that is not funny at all.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have your life plagued by your brother's pranks. He should have shared the pranks around a bit if he wanted this to be a long term thing. It's nothing short of bullying realy, plus it's put your job at risk. \n\nAs for your parents taking his side. They should have thought of the consequences of letting the punishment ride even after you proved your brother faked your poor report, instead of transferring the punishment to him. They would probably be less keen for him to make money off his pranks if they were the butt of every prank.", "NTA  \nAlso super fucked up that your parents punished you on the report card despite proving it was fake.", "NTA, prank youtubers are always the asshole.", "I can totally see how you'd think that. I got the idea ironically from my brother complaining about copywrite and how if there's music playing when he's doing his tiktok street interviews it can get his videos taken down and I know how ruthless disney is so I thought it'd be a good strategy to keep him away", "I am not, he keeps all the money because it's his channel", "She was 11-12. No preteen makes good decisions and he doesn't care that she says no now because she said yes 4-5 years ago. This doesn't seem to be a Y T A thing. Maybe YouTube will be able to help but i doubt they will because they'd be forced to watch one specific channel which i doubt they'd do. Maybe she can just report each video or keep blasting the music", "Considering he is making his money off of prancing you and you are the draw on his channel and without the prank videos he makes of you that get him views I would advise you to see legal counsel and sue him for the profit he has made off of those videos prancing you that he made without your consent.", "You took the words right outta my mouth. Bro needs to hire his money making talent. Cause it ain't his camera skills...", "OK this is my point. He's risking your safety. There are a lot of creepy people out there and just because you're living without normal access to social media to keep up with friends and family does't mean people can't spot your school logo in one of his videos and google high schools in your town. I really don't want to freak you out but my job involves knowing how easy it is to work out whether a FB page is the same person as the person with that name on our database, and for most people it's insanely easy because of details like 'Go \\[school sports team\\]!' or 'The traffic on \\[road near their address\\] is awful, 15min to get one mile!' Exactly what amount of money is worth the risk?", "Document everything and tell your parents if he doesn\u2019t leave you alone you will tell social media the truth about them. Make sure you secretly record this and give it to someone you trust just to be safe. Ask your parents why they don\u2019t care about you? Ask them why they let you be abused in your own home where you\u2019re supposed to feel safe? Ask them what kind of parents do this to their own child?\n\nThey\u2019ve already showed you they don\u2019t care about you at all. They only care about money. Your brother is abusive, those are not pranks. I think you should release your story on social media and tell people to stop watching those videos because you never consented and tell everyone the truth about how you\u2019re being treated .", "Sorry, 11-12 isn't old enough to understand the implications of being in the videos and your parents need to wise up fast. There's a reason a kid that age can't sign a contract on their own behalf.", "Probably also the golden child is make and OP is female. I wonder if that is also why OP is not getting support from her parents.", "And, why his pranks are getting meaner and viewers are enjoying it. Misogyny ftw."]}
