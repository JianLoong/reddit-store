If the speaker is working I\u2019d stick with it and have it ready on your phone also as a backup.", "NTA, and you\u2019re kind of a genius for deploying the Disney tunes like that.", "NTA, use their horrendously strict copyright grip to your advantage if it means he leaves you alone. Make sure your speaker stays safe though. Also that's some B.S. they didn't unground you after you proved the report card was fake. He can provide for his family in a way that isn't harassing his little sister, it's sick your parents are siding with him. Save your money so you can move out when you can.", "NTA and on YouTube you can actually have his videos taken down as it against their TOS. look up how to submit privacy claims on YouTube and force him to have all videos with you removed or have his account deleted. I've seen YouTubers who go around harassing people in public who then get butthurt when their victims force them to edit them out of the video or delete it entirely.", "NTA. Rather like someone with a water pistol to repel feral cats, it sounds as though you've come up with an appropriate and reasonably successful way to deal with your brother's annoying and exploitative behaviour. (You're a minor; can it even be legal for him to take advantage of you in this way without your consent?)\n\nI'm sorry that your parents are supporting him. Sounds like you just need to keep your head down and defend yourself as best you can until you can move out. Wishing you luck, and sorry you are having to deal with this nonsense.", "If you are the \u201ctalent\u201d in his channel\u2019s coni \u2014 then you should be getting paid for each video that features you. Like - a LOT of money.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s filming you and bothering you against your will. If you stop and allow him to continue you should be getting a cut of the money", "YTA without reading because Disney sucks chunks. Period.", "I love that", "I think your parents are doing terrible by not protecting you at all. Heck, they grounded you for A MONTH for nothing. What an absolutely shit and pathetic thing to do.\n\nHave they ever shown that you matter to them? \n\nYour brother is a bully, clearly.", "You arn't correct.on this; a house is not a public area. You are citing rules for recording in public areas. For an example that makes sense, think of her bedroom, or the bathroom in the house. Surely as a minor she would have rights to not be recorded in those spaces. Good try I guess.", "Next time he does something like that, you can also try saying \"I do not consent to being on video\" \"I do not consent for any video of me to be published.\" You may be 16, but you have rights. He won't be able to post it without suffering public backlash and potential legal repercussions.", "[removed]", "A house is not a public area, but having permission to film mostly means the rules are as if it were.\n\nYes, a bedroom and a bathroom are different. I said that, too.", "NTA. Order a tshirt and a hoodie with \"**I don't consent to my face being in this**\" and \"**I am not okay, please stop**\". Soon, he'll be furious because that and the Disney music will make it obvious that you are a unwilling participant.", "NTA, also I would contact youtube and you can ask them to take down any video's with you in it since you did not consent to being filmed. If anything you should be able to get his videos demonetized.", "NTA. He is filming you without your consent and making money from it. That\u2019s exploitation and you are a minor, so he\u2019s darn lucky all he\u2019s getting is his footage ruined.", "NTA. He is actively sabotaging and causing you distress in many aspects of your life including your school, work and home life. You clearly don't consent to his 'pranks'. I think you should seriously consider filing for emancipation or moving in with another family member such as a grandparent if you can. Please get you boss to ban your brother from your place of work and call the cops every time he rocks up to 'prank' you. You could even file a restraining order and report some of his antics against you to the police such I wouldn't be surprised if some of his 'pranks' enter the criminal realm.", "NTA... Did you copy that idea from some USA cop?", "1) he\u2019s harassing you\n2) your parents seem not to give a cr*p\n3) makes money by harassing you\n4) doesn\u2019t even pay you??\nAnd somehow you should stop with Disney music? NTA", "NTA. and if you want to go full 30 rock, get a hockey goalie mask with the team logo on it and put it on whenever he starts filming.", "You are the one making him money if he can't make the content without you. He's upset he can't harass you for money anymore. Keep protecting yourself.", "NTA definitely, he's such an AH and it's really sad that he can't get views himself. tell him sorry but you can't go back on a punishment!", "NTA.You can stop playing disney music, and start playing spoilers to all the shows he's watching? :)  \nEdit:   \nYou know.... as a \"Prank\", haha so funny.", "NTA but get a specific restraining order that he cannot film you. Or file a suit that you haven\u2019t been paid for your appearances. Definitely go LC with parents asap", "Also what kind of parent doesn\u2019t \u201cever back down on their punishments\u201d? Yikes. That\u2019s some hard \u201cthe parents are never wrong\u201d mentality they are driving there, and it really doesn\u2019t show you a healthy view that parents are human too and can make human mistakes.", "This is what I would do. I would report every single video I was in without my consent.", "how does OP suck", "Have you looked into emancipation which in many places you can do at 16 if you could support yourself with your job? You could use the harassment from your brother as part of the emancipation request. Do you have another family member you could move in with? Have you tried convincing your boss to ban your brother from your place of work? Tell you boss to call the cops every time your brother turns up to 'prank' you. Also let your school know about the situation since your brother is messing with your homework.", "Can't he just move in volunteers to be pranked like Jake Paul does? Jake Paul sucks but at least all the people in his house that get pranked agree to be there.", "Please file for emancipation or at least look into emancipation. Here is a link explaining emancipation for you.\n\n[https://www.findlaw.com/family/emancipation-of-minors/emancipation-of-minors-basics.html](https://www.findlaw.com/family/emancipation-of-minors/emancipation-of-minors-basics.html)", "I had to reread the post. My first thought was blasting music is a sucky thing to do. However, in rereading, I see OP is protecting herself from harassment and bullying.\n\nOP-apologies. You are in a horrible situation where everyone else is an AH by supporting such awful family dynamics.", "he bought a house and pays the mortgage for it", "Yeah, what the heck is up with the parents who \"don't go back on their punishments\"?   And yet the brother experiences no repercussions for faking the whole report card?", "NTA if your so popular and apparently Important for his followers- he should be splitting the profits with you.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents can become his victims, you should be on social without your consent. Keep working and studying, and look for scholarship so you can get out of there as soon as possible", "NTA.    I like the Bluetooth idea", "What the hell do you mean his fans like you, a 16 year old girl? Tiktok is a fucking blight. NTA", "NTA time to go to the police station, show all his \u201cPranks\u201d and get a restraining order.", "Keep doing it, fuck his views, fuck his tik tok. If he was really that talented of a \"Content Creator\", he can do it without the aide of scaring his sister.", "Yeah. This comment isn\u2019t getting upvoted enough. Now, I\u2019m not sure where op lives or the legality of filming a minor without consent, but she should definitely report it to YT and TT. \n\nHeck even if it\u2019s not illegal, they are likely to remove the videos.", "Op already found a solution. If her asking worked she wouldn\u2019t be in this situation", "If the parents are so worried to lose the house they can become op brother victims. Exploiting a kid and force her on social is not the way to keep money.", "Op is working so she is proving for herself. Her parents can go to work and not forcing her to be exposed on the social. Op doesn\u2019t want a social media account so the revenge part is useless.", "This is the way. Remember that report card prank and subsequent punishment. You love and respect your wonderful parents and are following in their footsteps and tradition. It's tough love and it hurts you to do it.... but you must follow through out of love for your brother.", "All the money...", "That's like Brad Pitt in his prime saying a colleague has long legs .... it's not harassment if you want him to flirt.", "It feels like because she works a \u201creal job\u201d and he\u2019s a \u201cprank YouTuber\u201d, you guys are missing the context- her earning pocket money for herself is not more important than him keeping the bills paid for their family, herself included.", "Baffled to what you\u2019re trying to say here.", "Her parents are two adults and can continue to work. Op shouldn\u2019t be sacrificing her mental health for them to have more luxuries. She didn\u2019t say they were starving did she ?", "Bills can be paid in many other way that not jeopardize op future and mental health. \n\nOp is studying should she have her future ruined because she will always be \u201cthe sister of the prankster\u201d just because the parents can have more luxuries?", "/u/Right_Guarante is a scammer!  **Do not click any links they share or reply to**.
