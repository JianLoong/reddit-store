He\u2019s filming you without your consent at the expense of your schooling, work and wrongful punishment from your parents. Don\u2019t be surprised if he does something to the speaker.

Half of the profits plus half of the creative decisions, so you will have to agree in advance about where, when, and how he can film you.

Isn't a prank supposed to be funny???", "Obviously NTA.

When you say he is \"providing for us\" what do you mean by that.  Is his youtube money literally going towards household experiences that you benefit from?

Obviously a \"NO\" from the actual person being filmed *should* carry more weight, but legal, moral, and right do not always align.)\n\nI have seen exactly one thing interesting enough to bother with TikTok.

He's still making money from those videos.\n\nWhen it comes to pranks he doesn't believe in boundaries or \"faking\" (telling me about what he did) before hand because he likes getting my genuine reaction to whatever he's done. Him not faking his prank is one of the reasons people like his content unfortunately", "I don't have any social media and am not interested in making one. Seeing gross comments on his own videos is bad enough, I don't want to have to see those all the time or have people know anything about me outside of the videos", "This was my thought.

Not the brother.", "Based on your other comments, it sounds to me like the pranks are something for *you* to endure\u2014 and not them. If your parents are off limits and yet they continue to reap the benefits of your brother\u2019s success, then you have every right to be off limits as well. This isn\u2019t something that is applying equally to your parents, and it\u2019s unreasonable for it to be something that you solely bare the burden of. \n\nKeep blasting that music, and protect that speaker!", "Your parents are not doing their best.
