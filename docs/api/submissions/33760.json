We get along fine and were friends before she moved in with me. A month ago I decided to order an adult toy and this happened to arrive with Christmas presents. While opening all the packages getting ready to wrap them, we were confused because there was a plain white box. I opened it up and was caught by surprise, because I honestly forgot I ordered it. My housemate was there at the time and we had a laugh about it. \n\nFast forward to Christmas eve and my mum is visiting. My housemate is preparing to travel to their parent\u2019s home for the holidays and is waiting for the taxi. I get along great with my mum but we do not have the kind of relationship where we talk about everything, somethings we just don\u2019t talk about. My housemate knows this, but out of no where she proceeds to tell the story about when we were unwrapping the packages and goes into vivid detail about what the adult toy looks like. I give her a look of \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d But she proceeds and makes sure my mum knows that it is mine. After finishing she bursts out laughing and I walk away. My housemate gets in her taxi and leaves. This created a very awkward environment in the house for the rest of the day and when I woke up on Christmas, I was very annoyed. My mum asked why I was in a short mood and explained that I felt my housemate crossed a ginormous boundary of mine. She understood but said she had forgotten about it.\n\nNow, the reason I didn\u2019t address the inappropriateness when it happened, is because I am known to react very emotional to things in the moment. I\u2019ve learned to just walk away think about how I feel and then think of a way to react appropriately. But this is something that I just can\u2019t seem to shake and every time I think about it I get very annoyed. I\u2019m asking WIBTAH or should I just move on?
