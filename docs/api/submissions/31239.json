It might take some time to really open my mind up a bit, but I see now that I was actually really awful to someone who is suppose to be my friend. Alice is a really kind, sweet and strong person after everything she's been through, I took her horrible experiences and minimised them in a disgusting way and I don't know why I feel the way I do about tattoos, maybe it's consuming way too much social media where people pretty much do anything for attention, but for some reason I reacted so strongly and I think I need to explore that. Maybe it'll help to talk to a professional.\n\nSeeing comments of people agreeing with me and expressing their disgust with tattoos made me realise that in 25 years or so, I DON'T want to be that kind of person, because I feel like I'll be alone for the rest of my life if I continue thinking the way I do. Its not so much pressure or fear of being alone, but worry more about what kind of person I'll become if I continue to insult the people I care about and who care about me and have done nothing but be there for me.\n\nI'm going to apologise to Alice and maybe ask if I can go with her if she ever gets another tattoo, just so I can understand the process and get to know the people in the industry. I'm also going to ask if I can play the game she got the tattoo from with her too if she forgives me.\n\nI completely deserved my verdict because I acted unfairly, and thanks to people in DMs that were patient and calm while I was completely awful. I can't guarantee an overnight change, but I'm willing to try to open my mind a bit better and give back to my friend what she's given me in the years we've known each other.\n\nI'm going to try to do better.\n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1700342016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yg7j8/update_aita_for_telling_my_friend_her_tattoo_is/", "score": 235, "replies": ["Well done. You asked and heard. \n\nI am not a tattoo fan. I dont mind that others have them but I have never wanted one. They are just not for me. \n\nHowever I have always seen the beauty in them. I see the artistic value and the history of them. I love watching shows about tattooing to see how they come up with idea's and how they fix mistakes, it is fascinating. \n\nBut I have never wanted one. \n\nUntil one day I lost someone so important to me, someone I could never imagine living without. On that day, I felt like I had been kicked out of heaven. I pondered things for several months, then I got a tattoo. It is usually hidden from others, on my shoulder. I know it is there, it comforts me. It makes me happy. It is my personal memorial to what I lost. \n\nYour friend has done the same. Maybe not for someone she lost but for huge emotional reasons just the same. She survived. It is her scar. It is her proof of her own strength. \n\nI am glad you realized that. Give her a hug from me.", "Thanks /u/FixMix2 for being such a good cautionary example!", "Good for you for listening to good advice and being big enough to apologize.", "I\u2019ve never understood the idea that people get tattoos/piercings/etc. for attention. People don\u2019t alter their bodies for the approval of others. They do it because that\u2019s what they like. I like my tattoos and piercings. I don\u2019t care if other people do, it\u2019s not their body and it wasn\u2019t for them in the first place. It\u2019s for me, I want them so I got them. I enjoy that I can decorate my body how I see fit.", "Proud of you OP!", "That's really good to hear, OP.  I hope things get better between you and Alice.", "I\u2019m glad you are using this as an opportunity to challenge why you hold such anger for something that ultimately doesn\u2019t affect you.  My personal issue is I don\u2019t know why people don\u2019t have basic tact skills for these sorts of things, outside of having their own issues that they are projecting, as it seems to be the case here. \n\nLike me I\u2019m not a huge fan of tattoos but outside some pretty specific and generally agreed upon limits of offensive subject matter, my response is to support what makes my friend happy and find something that I like about the piece to compliment them on and inquire what it means to them or if this is a new tattoo artist etc so they can better share their experience with me.  \n\nIf I don\u2019t understand something and I feel it\u2019s appropriate to ask them, I do that.  In this situation it\u2019d be \u201dHuh, I don\u2019t understand.  Would you mind walking me through how seeing that reminder on you helps you?  It\u2019s just hard for me to process that concept at all.\u201d\n\nAsking carefully considered appropriate questions and doing your best to read the situation before saying more and perhaps tabling the question till a later date are all useful skills to learn.  If you try to lead with good intentioned curiosity along with asking permission first and that it\u2019s okay for them to not answer is much better than coming in hot with anger when confronted with confusion of an unknown/new thing.  \n\nSome things to consider while doing internal challenges.  It\u2019s hard but as someone who has done a lot of that since my early 20\u2019s the time and effort it took me and continues to take me is the best investment of my time and effort that I ever made.  Also a good place to start is working on your patience.  It is a powerful skill that is often undervalued and yet it is so useful in everything you do.", "Please make sure your apology has no excuses. No \"I'm sorry, but....\"", "The issue isn\u2019t being online, the issue is you thinking you\u2019re an authority on someone else\u2019s body/appearance.\n\nAlso you sound extremely old fashioned/conservative in your views on tattoos.  It\u2019s 2023 people are a lot more open and free with self expression", "I had a coworker show me his new tattoo that honestly looked like a horrible prison tattoo.  He kept bugging me about that stupid tattoo, wanting to know if I liked it, and wouldn't leave me alone, so I said, \"do you really care what I think?  You are the one who designed it, paid for it, and have it permanently  on your skin.  What I think is irrelevant. \"\n\nHe finally left me alone.", "It\u2019s almost never worth being critical of a friend\u2019s tattoos. Hurts them for no reason, and what are they going to do, magic erase?", "I had to go to the original post so their comments and man. Thank you for this comment! That person needs to get off line (as should I lol).", "I was about to say the same thing lol", "Right? I have lots of tattoos and hate attention. I get them because I like how they look.", "This is the shit we\u2019re here for. Good job, admit you were wrong, apologise, and hope she accepts it. \n\nAlso\n\n> made me realise that in 25 years or so, I DON\u2019T want to be that kind of person\n\nDude this is so much bigger than you probably even understand yet. Keep on keeping on. Growing never stops.", "Good job. I would refrain from comparing slave branding to personal tattoos in the future, that\u2019s a bit tasteless.", "Good on you for realising your wrongs. I'm proud of you.", "Its amazing that you have opened your mond to something new and that your going tbe patch things with your friend, maybe in the future your opinion about tattoos will completely change you might end up with a tattoo your self! So proud of you b-fly!", "Nice. Reflecting and developing is the most essential part of this life. Keep going, you\u2019re doing the right things.", "I'm really proud of you for realizing your mistake and understanding how to go about it, OP. For the record, you never have to really change your opinion on tattoos too drastically. \n\nMy own wife doesn't want any because she thinks it's too permanent a practice and she just \"doesn't love anything that much\" (other than me, her words lol). It makes sense to me. But she likes mine. Has even helped design a couple! You don't have to like something to understand why someone else would, and respect their decisions. I'd say you're well on your way to having a much healthier and happier mindset. \u2665\ufe0f", "Ink Master is a show on, I think it\u2019s on Paramount.  I haven\u2019t watched it for a few years, so I\u2019m not sure about the latest seasons.  I watched seasons 1-3 and I never really liked tattoos, but by watching that show I realized and began to really appreciate the artistry of it.  It\u2019s a competition show where the contestants have to do tattoos in different styles and then the judges critique them, but also discuss the different styles, so I learned a lot about that, too. \n\nTattoo artists really are artists and their canvas is skin, but unlike canvases, everyone\u2019s skin is different and they have the added challenges of working with people who who may move (can ruin fine line work,) but also if the person is fat or thin, where the tattoo is placed on the body (tattoos on ribs is painful) etc.  \n\nI now have a lot of respect for tattoo artists and when I see someone with a tattoo, depending on who and where, I\u2019ll ask about it and look closely because most are proud of them and like to talk about it, especially with those who have a real interest.  \n\nSo I would suggest OP check out this and other shows. Oh, those who do cover ups, wow. There are shows that focus on that and some of those artists are incredibly creative.  \n\nIt\u2019s great that you took time to reflect and admit you were wrong about judging and voicing your views.", "Most of my tattoos are memorials. I love them because it feels like they're still here with me.\n\nI love getting compliments from people who have no visible tattoos but appreciate the art in mine. Always makes me smile.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I hope your tattoo helps you as mine do for me. \u2665\ufe0f", "My mom thinks I got my tattoos specifically to make her mad. It\u2019s that kind of narcissism that leads me to a very rich experience in therapy!", "The comment history is rough for sure", "Why not just say \"not my style but I'm glad you got something you like\"? Gee whiz.", "My brother once got a tattoo of a baked potato just to piss my mom off, because she called tattoos useless and he wanted \u201cthe most useless, inane tattoo possible\u201d to prove her right and wrong at the same time. She asked why he did it, and he looked her dead in the eyes and said \u201cbecause it\u2019s funny, and that\u2019s the point\u201d while my dad and I cackles from the couch\n\nbut that\u2019s likely a whole other thing than what you\u2019ve got going and I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with it all.", "My dad said the same! My very first tattoo was a memorial FOR HIS SON, and he thinks it's something I've spent well over $1000 and counting just to piss him off. \ud83d\ude44 Unbelievable, that man."]}
