I have multiple disabilities and difficulties including autism, anxiety, and vocal issues.\n\nBack when I first started classes, I would go on campus 3 times a week to meet up with other friends and mutuals. At some point, one mutual I only knew from one class asked if they can bring another person to the group meetups to which we all agreed at first. For privacy sake, I\u2019ll call him Greg. Greg also has autism and I think some kind of personality disorder. It started off calm with him being a bit clingy and nosy in general but nothing too bad. Soon he became a bit too \u201ccomfortable\u201d. I won\u2019t say all because this subreddit is extremely strict about \u201cnon-verbal\u201d gestures but he had habit of calling some of us gross nicknames when asked to stop, as well as just being very needy and quick to getting angry if he didn\u2019t get attention he was seeking. We didn\u2019t talk about him much outside the meetups because we all tried to bite the bullet but most of the others were visibly uncomfortable.\n\nNormally I had a habit of tolerating people due to my vocal issues and low self esteem, but the way he treated my other friends annoyed the hell out of me. And it didn\u2019t help when the mutual who introduced Greg to the group kept brushing off complaints on his behavior and inviting him to join meetups anyways because he \u201cjust couldn\u2019t help it\u201d. But the final straw was when one of my best friends in the group called me on the phone crying one night and said she refused to come to anymore meetups if Greg was there because he had made fun of one of her insecurities regarding her body after she rejected his advances. That was when I snapped. The next day I came to campus and I let all my personal thoughts out on him and almost yelled at him for all the harassment he had put everyone else through. \n\nHe tried to get defensive and say I was being an ableist because he had a hard time picking up social cues to which I called bull since many people asked him to stop. I said I didn\u2019t care what the hell he had or didn\u2019t have, that I was on the same spectrum and that he can go \u201cscrew\u201d himself if he couldn\u2019t treat others with respect. I left and almost started crying myself over how stressed and anxious the situation made me feel. Later I received angry texts from the mutual saying I caused \u201cchildish drama that could have been avoided\u201d and I didn\u2019t need to come anymore if I was gonna overreact. That was a few days ago and I haven\u2019t gone since, neither has my best friend. Some of my other friends in the group backed me up and said they would start trying to do different meetups without Greg or the mutual. But I\u2019m still receiving angry texts from mutual saying I should have done better. Maybe it is just them taking advantage of my anxiety on the situation, or maybe they are right. I don\u2019t regret yelling at him, but I do regret letting it go on for so long and not thinking of a mature solution sooner.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667239809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yijs8a/aita_for_telling_off_another_disabled_student/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
