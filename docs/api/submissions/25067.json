Get yourself someone better. Fuck this guy.", "NTA. Seems like when he saw you ordered very little he felt entitled to order his usual and spend more thinking you\u2019d cover the difference.

He\u2019s trying to see how much he can pull over on you.

NTA if you pay for only your meal.  Generous if you give him the $50 you decided was your max.  Do NOT give him more than that.  \n\nIf you had stayed at the start that the meal would be your treat, how would his order have been different?  Bigger entree?  Bottle of wine?  Dessert?  How much more would he have taken advantage?", "NTA", "If I saw a chicken Caesar salad for $22 I would laugh and walk out lol.. that\u2019s absurd. You guys shouldn\u2019t even be at restaurants like this if you\u2019re broke and budgeting money in between pay.. it\u2019s not a bad thing to do once in a long while, but it sounds like you guys should have scaled it back to a place that has entrees for $15-30 not $30-100 with $22 salads.. not trying to be rude but the root of this problem is living outside your budgets/means.

That's the only thing that might excuse his initial assumption.

I would send him the cost of your entree plus half the tip with note \"my part of dinner bill\". That's it. You don't cover his part.

He should've been more straight forward so you could've been like my budget is under $50 for tonight.", "NTA He spent 75 one dish whilst talking about a cheaper option wtf, that's so expensive and no way would I pay half after the convos you had re budgets that's so rude of him.", "I thought about it, but does that seem like I'm being petty towards my partner by caring about things like this? It's not even about the money, but more the principle. I don't want him to get used to me paying his portion every time.

You are not getting what is fair here. I have no idea what your money situation is like but worst case scenario if you cover part of his meal it could mean you cannot pay your rent, buy lunches for work, put petrol in your car for work or pay for public transport for work.

Is this new to the relationship? What\u2019s been the standard?", "I think I really only feel bad about it bc I would be paying $50-55 and he'd have to cover almost double what I'd be paying.", "He also ordered that though", "He ordered more than double what you ordered. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s more than fair, especially considering you agreed on a budget in advance.", "He told you he's on a budget and wouldn't order his usual. He orders his usual plus extras and expects you to cover the things that are over his budget regardless of your budget.\n\nHe could have ordered according to his budget but he didn't. That's on him only. Why should you shoulder his part?", "No, he would not be paying \"almost double\". He would be paying for 73% of what he ordered, and you would be paying for 160% of what you ordered. How is that fair?? He's literally stealing from you."]}
