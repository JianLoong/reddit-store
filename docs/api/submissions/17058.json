It's lovely that you still will do stuff for your Wife but you should be honest and open with her on how you're feeling .", "NAH - Maybe have a chat with your wife and explain that you are still struggling with your grief over your Mom, and although you absolutely want to celebrate her and make the day special for her (as you should - and she should for you on Father's day!), you would like to give the big family gathering a miss this one time. \n\nI'm so sorry you lost your Mom. I lost my Dad years ago and Father's Day hurt for a long time. But I promise it won't hurt forever - it will get easier.", "NTA - that\u2019s not your mother. Thankfully my husband understands and never pressures me about this.", "INFO:  have you talked to your wife about this?", "NTA, I lost my mother when I was in my 20s and I understand your feelings. I would suggest that you frame it with your wife and MIL that you are getting together with your family to celebrate your mom, so they see what you are doing as still part of a Mother\u2019s Day event. Sign a card for MIL, make sure she gets flowers and time with her daughter and grandchild, but you can say you aren\u2019t ready to have a Mother\u2019s Day where you don\u2019t do something for your own mother.", "NAH, but I think you should go", "NTA\nYou\u2019re still mourning. You should talk to your wife and explain. Hopefully she will understand that this isn\u2019t personal to your MIL. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I hope your memories of her bring you some comfort.", "NAH but I think you would be wise to take some specific time to grieve your mom and still celebrate that your wife is a mom and her mom is still in her life.   Tell them both some happy memories of your mom as you celebrate them.\n\nHeck tell me one.  Do you have a special Mother\u2019s Day memory?\n\nYou can be sad and still manage to politely function around family.   I\u2019m guessing your mom would want that for you.", "NTA I'm so sorry for your great loss.", "NTA - You\u2019re allowed to grieve and take your time to heal. Maybe you can ask your wife to do something for your r mother as well. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll understand. It\u2019s a pretty normal request. Maybe go to her grave and put some flowers down or something. That\u2019s not to say she doesn\u2019t celebrate her mother just maybe you can celebrate both.", "NTA, I would not go to her family get together and instead do something your mom enjoyed. Celebrate your own mom.\n\nExplain to your wife that you\u2019ll make everyone feel awkward if they see you crestfallen and grieving at a party. I really do hope she understands", "NTA\n\nShe's not your mom. I'm sorry for your loss.

It is still as raw and gut wrenching as it was 6 weeks ago. I have 2 adult children at home plus a bonus adult child here. I also have my dad down the street. I told all of them that I am not ready. I don't want presents or cards or calls (about 20 of their friends call me mom so they all usually call and send something). I just want it to be a normal day, granted a day I would be crying even more than I have been if that's even possible. I did agree to a brunch here with my dad (& mimosas) only because I don't want my dad home alone all day on a day he'd be thinking about her. I don't think I'm selfish for this and I don't think you're selfish for how you feel. You're not saying you won't celebrate your wife for her being a mother you're just not ready to go back to how it was before because you can't. \nNTA", "NTA - you understandably miss your mom. You  say your wife understands but is upset because it's a family lunch. She can still celebrate with her mom, you can't. How fair is it to put you through that knowing you're hurting? Please don't go to this lunch and grin and bare it. That's really unfair to yourself. How would she feel if the tables were turned?", "NTA - You unfortunately lost 1 of the 2 people you owe celebrating on Mothers Day and this Mothers Day you are still going to celebrate the second person but want to grieve the first person. Thats extremely reasonable.", "I love my wife and given the journey she took to be a mom she needs to be celebrated and she gave us an amazing boy however I feel odd wishing her mom. I think deep down maybe I\u2019m a bit jealous and her Mom is also very rough around the edges, opinionated, downright rude sometimes so it doesn\u2019t really make it more enticing.", "Sorry for your loss.", "I know right ? Glad you have a supportive Hubby", "Yes I spoke to her yesterday. She is definitely trying to be understanding but I think deep down she might be a little upset because it is a family Mother\u2019s Day get together. I did mention to her that I will come along because of her but I don\u2019t feel like wishing her mom because I miss mine. It is a tough situation.", "The whole wishing thing is what I\u2019m struggling with. Maybe I\u2019m being selfish", "I did and I think she understood tbh I would have maybe been more receptive if she wasn\u2019t constantly criticizing my wife and being a little prickly", "I agree, celebrating my wife\u2019s motherhood is my duty and I will gladly however I think part of the reason is that her mom always says insensitive things in general and even her compliments have some aspect of a back handed comment. I guess I would have more inclined to share it with her if she was nicer and \u201cmotherly\u201d she is usually very selfish and says mean things. \nShe makes very little effort to hang out with her grandson and when she does she always has something negative to say to my wife. Throughout my wife\u2019s maternity leave she didn\u2019t once come over or offer to watch the baby so my wife could have rested. I get it she is an old lady and we always thought she might drop the baby but the thought would have counted. I guess all these things just add to me not really wanting to around someone who is mostly insensitive.", "I\u2019m sure she would.", "Yes absolutely I am thinking of getting her a Caribbean trip", "Sorry but no she isn\u2019t. Similarity my wife doesn\u2019t call my dad her dad either.", "I'm fairly sure OP isn't from Alabama.", "My heart goes to you. I hope you have a peaceful time reminiscing. Every one should be allowed to grieve in their own way. My condolences to you and your family.", "That is the amazing part about my wife she is very understanding and my rock. She is ok but I have immense guilt for not supporting her at a family gathering. I feel like if I don\u2019t go , regardless of what the Reddit community thinks her family will probably deem me the ah", "I understand how much you miss your Mom.  I miss mine too.  She died from cancer in 2013 and it still hurts.  Avoiding your MIL on Mother's day might be a big mistake.  I'm assuming you get along with MIL.  If you don't then, by all means, stay away.  But if you do get along, I would go just to support the wife.  NTA.", "It\u2019s hard not to be a little resentful of people that still have their mothers and mothers that have outlived your own, particularly the mother that gets to spend Mother\u2019s Day with the grandchild your own mother never met. But envy and jealousy are toxic and destructive to your own happiness - remember that these are the two mothers who play the biggest role in your life now, it\u2019s not their fault that your mother isn\u2019t here, and that them having a bad Mother\u2019s Day would do nothing to alleviate your pain. Your circumstances do not negate the fact that MIL deserves a good Mother\u2019s Day and you should be able to bring yourself to wish her one and being kind to your MIL doesn\u2019t in any way mean that you aren\u2019t sad or that you aren\u2019t mourning. If you can find a little generosity in your heart, you should be able to be thankful that your wife has so far been spared the pain that you are suffering and hope that she and her mother take advantage of their good fortune and make the most of this day.", "Oh no. Yeah I wouldn\u2019t want to be around someone who is always putting my spouse down. Why would I celebrate someone who does that to their own child. \nIf excuse myself from that event as well. Seems like she doesn\u2019t deserve such a celebration. \nJust celebrate your wife and mom\u2764\ufe0f", "If your MIL is that negative towards your wife, why are you celebrating mother's day with her at all?\n\nYou have your own family of three now. Celebrate with your wife and son only.\n\nAlso my husband and have never congratulated our respective MILs for mother's day, only our own mothers.", "Well that is an entirely different MIL issue than your grieving imho.   I still think sharing a cherished memory of your mom with someone caring is a good strategy when you are feeling sad.\n\nSorry you have that situation - I had a great MIL and I miss her.   She was a great cook and really loved to make things I liked and always managed to make more food than we could eat.  I had to be careful not to politely tell her I liked something I wasn\u2019t that fond of because she would remember and serve it every time after that.   She treated me like family from even before I dated her daughter.", "This made me chuckle this morning... thanks!", "Thank you. I almost came on here to ask if IWATA for handling it this way but my boys and my dad are super supportive and they have reassured me that it's my day anyway and I should spend it however I'm comfortable.", "I get along ok I guess. Whenever she says something I smile and nod politely because I know she is old and unhappy. I guess I will take sometime to visit my mom and try to get over it cuz this will probably go on until her mom is around. I just feel odd saying it to someone else\u2019s mom when mine is around.", "It is a tough thing that you are asking but logical nonetheless.", "By acknowledging And wishing your MIL Happy Mother's Day does not in Abu way diminish the love for your mom. She knows you loved her and it is not disrespecting her. I don't know, that's the way I felt the 1st 2 years.  It hurts and is hard, but it does get a bit easier as time goes by.  I lost my mom 3 yrs ago. Hugs to you and very dirty for your loss.", "Oh.... lol... NTA", "Thanks", "NTA but I would say explain it to your wife so she is made aware (if it isn't obvious to her yet) why you can't bring yourself to do so. And no amount of celebrating your MIL is going to help you cope or heal from missing your mom even more on such a day. It's something they need to respect. Neither should anyone bring up \"but it's been 2 year\". Similar to how no amount of celebrating your MIL is going to help you heal, time can't be the judging factor of when you will be okay. That is up for you to know and decide.", "NTA. But please speak to your wife about your feeling in an open and honest and gentle way. I'm sure she would like to understand your feelings.", "NTA", "Honestly, coming along and not even wishing her mom a happy Mother\u2019s Day is kinda rude. I think it\u2019s worse than just not going because it\u2019s too raw which is 100000% valid and understandable. Take care of yourself.", "You have nothing to feel guilty about though. If she's telling you that it's ok then take her word for it. Who cares what her family thinks? You and she are also a family and that takes precedence over whatever they feel. YOUR feelings matter.", "NTA", "NTA. You're grieving and you're entitled to live your feelings in a comfortable environment. \n\nA little suggestion: celebrate your wife, but also your mom. Make a donation, little or big this doesn't matter, in her name, it'll maybe help you to feel her closer.", "Maybe it's a cultural thing (Asian). We call our MIL and FIL mom and dad and treat them with the same respect we would give to our own parents."]}
