His note said he told his tenant to park on my lamd accross the street\n\nThat's a fine way to ask (sarcasm). I have no doubts that if your neighbor ASKED, you would help. However, he didn\u2019t even bother to get your permission", "NTA. Pretty ballsy of him to assume and then give his tenants permission, wow! I'd kick their asses off immediately! Is your neighbor paying property taxes on that land? Nope. You are.\n\nIf you just let them, after a period of time they might be able to legally claim ownership via Adverse Possession. Granted, it take a very long time but still, it's a risk.\n\nGood for you for reclaiming what's actually yours.", "NTA. It was incredibly presumptuous of him to offer up YOUR property.\n>\nPerhaps if you don\u2019t really need the space you can rent it out to them (but I\u2019d strongly advise a month to month lease).", "NTA.  Depending on where you live, it could become adverse possession if it goes on long enough.  If they are not willing to pay, let them park elsewhere.", "NTA, dependent on where you are you might need to take out public liability insurance for them to park on your land. You may also have to make sure the land is totally safe for them, and could be open to being sued if they have an accident \n\n(UK: https://www.mylawyer.co.uk/trespassing-a-A76076D34460/#:~:text=An%20owner%20or%20occupier%20of,treated%20as%20per%20civil%20trespass. )", "NTA\n\nIt is your property. If they, their visitors, or their property get damaged, you are liable.", "NTA.\n\nThe moment he assumed they could use it is the moment they were a complete A.\nThey could have knocked and asked, had you said no, then you would be in your rights, not an A but just not very neighbourly. \nThey didn't, they didn't even give you the chance, you were then very understanding and they've taken advantage.\n\nCharge them parking fees.\n\nTalk to your local council. Start taking pictures each day.", "NTA because it's your land and you can choose to do with it as you see fit. \n\nHe should have never told his tenant to park there without speaking to you first, rather than telling you after the fact that the tenant was going to start parking there. I can see why you're upset even if you're not using the land.\n\nIf they're unwilling to pay you a fee to park there (which is a reasonable request), they can just find other parking accommodations instead that are less convenient. Not your problem.", "NTA\n\nIt is your land, do with it as you please. They had no right to just park there. Kinda cowardly to slip a not under your door and say how it is going to be.", "NTA. If you let him direct his tenants there and ten years goes by, he could claim the land under adverse possession. Leaving it blocked off is fine, offering to rent it to them for an annual rent payment is also fine. Letting him take control of it isn't.", "NTA\n\nIt's your property. You can grant access to whomever you see fit.", "NTA.  Don't take liberties with shit that isn't yours.  Call a tow truck next time", "NTA they should have asked before just assuming they could use your property.", "NTA but you might be able to make some cash renting the parking space.", "NTA. They want to park there? Either the tenant or the neighbor can pay you monthly parking fee.", "NTA either way but I'm kind of on the fence about how harshly to judge neighbor. \n\nIf neighbor is charging new tenant rent, then he is a shady dude who is trying to take advantage of you... In that case, he ought to be offering to pay you for use of the space and you should have no guilt about restricting access.\n\nIf the new tenant is neighbor's family member who he took in temporarily or something, then I'd maybe consider lightening up on them a tad. Not that they are entitled to your spot, but it changes from being a neighbor actively taking advantage of you, to a neighbor who doesn't have many good options and was hoping you'd take pity on them. \n\nEither way, your spot, your rules.", "NTA - but not the nicest either. Someone telling you what they are going to do with your things isn\u2019t okay. Having boundaries is important. You should have told him upfront you didn\u2019t appreciate him just assuming he could use it. You would have appreciated him asking first. If you decided they could when there was no where else to park, that leaves it open for them to always say they had nowhere else to park. It would have been best just to tell them no if you were upset from the beginning. Then not asking was a warning sign they would twist your words to get what the originally wanted.", "I can see why you'd be upset with it because of his approach. NTA.", "Your land, your financial responsibility if anything happens. You need to protect your liability. No one gets access to your property for free.\n\nNTA", ">he told his tenant to park on my land\n\nHe doesn't get to decide this. He should have asked. \n\nYou're right to stop them parking there. NTA", "NTA.  You should have him rent the spot.  With a proper legal document.", "They think that because you park there sometimes they can park there all the time. You need to put your foot down and hope they can\u2019t pay rent so they gave to move out. Bad neighbor.", "NTA. Noone has the right to just dictate what they are going to do with your property. \nI would slip a note under your neighbour's door requesting back rent for the time it was being used. $150/month should do it.", "I\u2019m sure the landlord didn\u2019t tell them what was said and just told them yeah y\u2019all park over there not in my drive way anymore. Nta", "NTA\u2026nope.  Because the more you let this neighbor take advantage, I believe legally, this land could be theirs after so long.", "NTA\n\nYour neighbor has a tenant, who theoretically they are earning passive income from, and they are taking advantage of YOUR property to their benefit. The neighbor didn\u2019t ask before telling his tenants to park on your land and he didn\u2019t even offer to rent the space as tenant parking. So no, you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA, they're lucky you aren't charging them to park there (which you should btw).", "NTA. \n\nI believe this is something called theft by conversion. He cannot profit off of property he essentially stole from you. A nice cease and desist from a lawyer who nicely explains this to him ought to do the trick.", "NTA. You have to be careful depending on where you live for eminent domain. It might be a pain but you start parking there if it\u2019s just across the street and give them formal notice next time they park there they will get towed.", "YTA - I will never understand the mentality of people who begrudge someone parking on a bit of land they don\u2019t use and causes them no issues if they do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
