That makes it harder for you cause now they don't have the scene of the accident to go by.", "You are correct that it's not necessary to have one to file, but it is smarter to have a police report.

Mine does, though I\u2019ve never been involved in this type of accident.", "I have had police come out for even minor accidents, and I live in a big city. It would be worth calling the police.", "In New York the police won't even come out for small accidents where no one is hurt.

Take plenty of photos and for gods sake get the hell off the road so you don\u2019t mess up traffic. Especially in a rear ending situation, it\u2019s quite hard for them to ignore rear end damage on you and front end image on her, and it\u2019s her responsibility not to hit you. \n\nThe cops make everything worse these days, they never help anyone get off the road, and they just stopped traffic to fuck things up for everyone else. \n\nTake your pictures, get as much info as they\u2019ll give you,  get off the road as quickly as you can, and accept that bumpers are made out of plastic and won\u2019t look perfect forever. Call your insurance when you\u2019re in a safe spot. Move on with your life. Don\u2019t force everyone on their morning commute to go half speed while you sit there waiting for a police officer to come write down a bunch of meaningless paperwork that shouldn\u2019t even be a part of their job description.", "Yes but typically it's covered under your collision deductible.", "I don't know maybe? OP really hasn't said much on that, just curious why police weren't called at the time.", "Most municipalities allow you to file a police report after the fact for fender benders and other little stuff.  Basically, if the car is drivable, they expect you to move on."]}
