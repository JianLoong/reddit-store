I suppose he could claim she refused to supply her info (which may or may not be an issue depending on their location), but she can just as easily say she gave it to him and he must have lost it. I doubt that law enforcement will be interested in launching a hit-and-run investigation into a simple fender bender, especially when many law enforcement agencies won\u2019t even dispatch to the scene unless there are injuries.

Without seeing the scenario in person, I can only speculate, and as I hinted at above, I think there's more to this story that wouldn't really put the blame solely on the woman.  If both parties are up and alert, the first thing should be to ask if everyone's okay. Then, you can get into the insurance stuff. \n\nAlso, OP's resorting directly to insults is frankly very immature and I got a really bad vibe on his personality from the very start where he emphasized being on his way to his \"internship job\" while at the very same time assuming the woman's insurance was controlled by her \"parents\". Usually people in internships are middle to late teens up to maybe mid 20s, so I am assuming the woman was even younger if he had reason to believe that. \n\nAlso, the woman sort of had a point, in my perspective. If she truly just clipped the car, I cannot suspect that there would've been that much damage. I've got plenty of chips, scratches, and dings on my own car, not even from vehicular accidents, and so I can say with 100% certainty that it is simply a natural risk of owning/driving a vehicle. And I cannot stand people that, regardless of circumstances, treat a ding or scratch with the exact same emotional response as the complete totaling of a car. From my experience, it is usually only guys that think this way, and they do usually all have a certain personality. And, frankly, based on the associations with that type of personality I cannot confirm, nor deny, that maybe there was some truth to the woman's statement about why she wouldn't talk to him any longer.", "taking a photo of the plate might not really help dude. you need to call the police to have a report filed at the scene.", "Always call the cops. Quiets down that ego quick", "NTA", "Give her plate info to your insurance company. They should be able to pull the VIN from that and run a carrier discovery report.", "YTA. Bigtime . Huge.", "nta but that doesnt matter. you shouldve contacted the police, if she left the scene without providing her information then she could be charged with a hit and run (a misdemeanor where i am since you were in the car), and a police report would strengthen your case. insurance companies can be absolutely impossible. a while back someone ran into my parked car and i had to seek out videos from local business because of how ridiculous that shit was. good luck", "NTA Did you at least get her Driver License information?", "NTA, but you should have just called a cop as soon as she got snippy.", "i saw a \"parked\" car go backwards and hit another parked car cause the idiot never put the car in parked. watched as the victim was panicking cause he was a teen driver and her yelling that it wasnt her fault but his and told him to not speak to her in an accusatory way (like 8 people saw the accident). she got in the car, started eating pizza!, and got out to talk to the teen. then got back in the car and started crying, yelling at her helpful boyfriend and blaming him, all with a crying kid in the car. my mom went to offer help to the poor kid and he said he was talking to the boyfriend via text. \n\nanyways, op nta and people who dont think theyre responsible are obviously deflecting the blame. make sure you file a claim with insurance and put in a police report so its on file in case things go south.", "YTA\n\nLast year, I was rear-ended by a 16 year old. Totalled my car. Air bags went off. \n\nI called the police and waited for them to arrive. All I said to the kid was \"are your parents coming?\" And \"make sure you take photos.\" \n\nThe police came and got all the details. When the father arrived, he didn't have his insurance with him. But he obtained it and gave it to the cops. He promised to email it to me. (I confirmed with the cops that he had it.)\n\nI could have gotten mad. I mean he hit me as we were both going forward (I had slowed to make a turn with signal on). My airbags went off and hit me in the head so I hurt. I was missing an appointment. But getting angry wasn't going to change anything and wasn't going to help the situation. \n\nI let the cops still with the kid. \n\nYou let your anger get the best of you. And then you left without calling the cops to get a police report. You 100%. Don't leave the scene of an accident without a police report when it's not your fault. (I don't recommend doing it when it is your fault, but if the other side doesn't want to call the cops...)\n\nYou're going to have a hard time getting her insurance to pay for it because I have a feeling she's going to Tell a different story and you don't have a police officer to back you up.", "You should have called the police", "NTA and I get that the cops won't turn up for a fender bender with no injuries.  I'm in a wee community and even our cops ask you to call it in.\n\nI'm not sure why you'd wonder if losing your temper with her is even a question.  I'd have probably dealt with that attitude with anger, too.", "NTA. I\u2019m a woman. The accidents where I\u2019ve been either a driver or a passenger and I\u2019ve been hit that I can remember are:\n\nWoman who rear ended our car when I was around 11 or 12.

Where's the lie?", "You're right, that's just being selfish.", "That's the great thing about being rear-ended, there's very very few circumstances where it's your fault. The rear car should always be maintaining a safe breaking distance such that they're able to stop without hitting the car in front if it stops suddenly.", "Even being impatient in traffic, I'm cautious around emergency vehicles with sirens on, in case it suddenly turns my way, or someone avoiding it suddenly turms my way\n\nBut if it wasn't coming at you I can understand going ahead as normal, in general cautious drivers could still lead to wrecks by stopping when the average driver would keep going.", "Not true.", "For the most part.

It doesnt weaken your point and contrarily makes it stronger when you cant be accused of misrepresenting the data. \n\n> **fatal** crash involvements\n\nThat statistic says that men(especially young men) are causing more fatal crashes than women.  \n\nYou can also find a statistic that will tell you that women cause more total accidents per distance driven than men, because they do lead the fender bender category.", "Ummm...\"number plate\" doesn't sound very American, so not sure why we're discussing state laws?", "These days with every job being posted and applied to online there's no reason not to apply, what's the worst that'll happen? You get a cold email telling you no and that's that. Another thing being what I call the entry level paradox where \"entry level\" jobs want 2+ years of experience so your only option is to just keep applying and hope for the best.", "It may be easy to apply for jobs, especially nowadays online, but do women still bother to apply when they think the response will be no? The ease of application may mean more women shoot their shot now than in the past, but it would be interesting to see some up to date stats or research on it. \n\nBut the bigger problem is applying for jobs where it\u2019s higher up in a company. The jobs that aren\u2019t listed online. If a majority of women think they aren\u2019t qualified to apply or they know the culture of the company is patriarchal, they probably won\u2019t apply, because why bother taking the risk of being rejected if they already believe the answer will be no? And if a majority of men think they aren\u2019t qualified but will apply because they don\u2019t mind the risk of being rejected, or they are so bad at evaluating their risk of being rejected that they don\u2019t think they will be rejected; then over time more men will be in positions of power. Purely through them being the majority applying for those positions. Add that to historical and current discrimination against women in certain cultures and societies, and women aren\u2019t the ones up top making the decisions. \n\nBasically, I think women need to pause their thinking every time a job they want seems unrealistic, tell that realistic part of themselves to shut up, throw caution to the wind, and apply."]}
