Just because your brother is more mobile than you doesn't mean he's mobile enough to use the stairs on a regular basis and not risk hurting himself. It also really sucks to be told it's that or share your already small room with your sister. Of course this isn't your fault either. You didn't ask to be put in this crappy situation but neither did he.", "NAH. Short of buying a new house (which may not be possible given the market and medical bills if you're in the US), there isn't a perfect solution. You were a little harsh on your brother, but he's being a bit self-centered. It's kind of a shitty situation all around.\n\nAre there any renovations that could be done to the upstairs bedroom to make it bigger for your parents? Or a way to section off a part of the living room to make a room for you (even if it's temporary)? Something is better than nothing at least until you get a better idea of your prognosis.\n\nBest of luck to you OP and your recovery.", "NAH, you both are disabled right now and theres no easy solution: while he is less disabled than you now and maybe able to do the stairs, it still sucks for him to suddenly have the prospect of navigating stairs for who knows how long.  And you'reno doubt traumatised from the accident and sudden loss of ability.  Is there really no side room, like a dining room, that you can use for a second room?  When my daughter came home from the hospital with severe medical needs we turned the dining room into her room. Maybe try estate sales in upscale areas for someone selling their parents old stair lift?  I really hope you guys are able to work something out.  You guys need to give each other grace: you both have a shit situation dumped on you, and emotions are high from that.  Im rooting for you!", "NTA. I sympathize with your brother\u2019s situation but can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s come to expect some preferential treatment in your family, without consciously realizing it.\n\nYou\u2019re disabled and it\u2019s not fair to either of you to have to share rooms at your age.", "NTA could they cordon off another room  say a living room so you have your own room? Seems like he\u2019s the only one making the sacrifice here.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother has a lifelong chronic condition that he can use his legs some and while difficult, can navigate stairs. \n\nYou have a sudden acute condition that you literally can't use your legs and cannot currently navigate stairs. \n\nIt sucks all around, but until the lift gets installed or you graduate to crutches, bottom floor goes to the one who can't physically use the stairs at all.", "Info: is there only one room downstrairs that can function as a bedroom?", "NAH, both you and your brother shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this. Im more questioning why your parents bought a house with stairs when they have a chronically disabled child.", "NTA your brother will hopefully get his room back in due course. Currently your needs are greater than his.", "NTA, as of this moment you are more disabled and have less ways to get upstairs. When I had legs surgery I literally slept in the living room for months cause I couldn\u2019t walk anywhere without assistance or a wheelchair. You\u2019re lucky enough there\u2019s a bedroom so yeah you get to use it.", "NTA but I think your wording was a little off for the intended message. Didn\u2019t need to include about his disability, it\u2019s tough when he\u2019s spent his whole life adjusting to his own struggles so he feels like one of his needs are being taken from him. Of course his disability is valid but you\u2019ve spent your whole life catering to him for it, and now you\u2019re the one more in need when it comes to the bedroom situation. It\u2019s unfortunate that there\u2019s no ideal solution here but if you\u2019re that injured that you can\u2019t make it up on your own he\u2019s just going to have to see that and accept it. It\u2019s not fair by any means but the downstairs should be rightfully yours until you\u2019ve (hopefully!) made a full recovery. \n\nYour family seems very caring and has spent a lot of time caring for his medical needs and comfort and it\u2019s now his turn to do the same for you.", "Tentative NAH. What you said was pretty bad. I am cutting you some slack because you're adjusting to a sitter situation. \n\nBUT\n\nYour brother's needs have not got less just because you have more urgent requirements. He needed a downstairs room before. He still needs one now. I know there isn't one available and he's having to use an upstairs one for now but he definitely doesn't have to be happy about it or pretend it's not really hard for him to manage. And trust me, he knows everything does not revolve around his disability. He's had this his whole life putting limits on what he can do, where he can go, and how much extra things will cost for him. And that is still his situation now. You may get better. He definitely will not. Do not diminish his situation just because yours is new and horrible.", "NTA. your brother is being ableist. Your parents have two disabled children. Disability is really the only marginalized identity that you can \"acquire\" for lack of a better word literally at any point in your life, and similarly it's also the only one with the potential to be temporary. Right now, you are disabled. You were in an accident and you, for the time being, do not have the ability to walk-- that is a disability. Your brother is being ableist in positioning himself as the \"disabled child\"; you are literally BOTH DISABLED, lol. \n\nI don't know how the room problem is going to be solved without your dad carrying one of you. I think logistically it should be whichever person has more mobility which is, at this moment, your brother.", "NTA. It can be difficult for someone who is used to getting their way to understand that they aren't the only one who needs help now. He'll have to learn to adjust and maybe hearing it out loud will cause some self reflection. I hope you regain use of your legs.", "Nta.  He needs to realize your situation", "NTA he needs to get over himself.
