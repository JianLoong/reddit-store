After her father's death she practically moved into our home because my mother in law got severe depression. The house got pretty lonely for her, especially since my husband and I were out all the time.\n\nShe'd even stay for dinner as though it was her who was paying for it. She occasionally brought her kids with her and eventhough her daughters are incredibly sweet and even help around the house, her son makes me grateful I have no kids. I'd lock my room before going, but the rest of the house was never safe from this crotch goblin. My mother in law would never do anything and let him run wild. She'd say that her and her husband's pension was running half the house and she didn't mind anything he did. I lock my portion But I still live here and it's annoying.\n\nHe's getting therapy and the medical attention he needs to no effect. He makes loud noises and does all the things he knows annoy me Why not ask her girls to look after him? The eldest is 15.\n\nRecently my mother in law died. After the funeral was over though all The sisters are staying over just until all of them can get emotionally stable again but I decided to speak up now or I'll never get my home to myself. I told the sister with the kid that she's not invited anymore and I'm done with her kid. That it's my place now and no one gets to wreck it's peace. \n\nShe said that this was her home long before it was mine and she owns a portion in it. That she'll come by whenever she wants to. That I should just lock away my portion and whatever happens in the other portions is none of my business. In my anger I said that her rotten genetics are the reason I don't want any kids.\n\nI admit I might have crossed a line but she has her own home why does she need to wreck my peace? My husband's threatening to divorce me if I don't apologize. The other sisters have withdrawn their allowances and house helps, which I think is what bothers my husband alot because he thinks we won't be able to afford anything now. I told him that just goes to show that his sisters never loved him and only gave us money as charity. \n\nI think I should apologize because I don't want to ruin the family but I also think if I stay my ground, it would keep the sister away.

You and your husband live in his childhood home, the home was willed to your husband and his three sisters.

If I\u2019m understanding that correctly then you are without a doubt the AH.

YTA majorly!\n\nThat is not your home. This person grew up there, and was given a portion by her deceased family member. For you to act so entitled is insane!

You are not entitled to your sisters-in-law's help paying for domestic staff! They surely did that to maintain the property and standards of living of their parents, not you and your husband.

Your entitlement and horrendous behaviour have led to you & hubby no longer being able to afford the house.

He has 3 sisters who live in different cities. We've never looked into moving out and never wanted to either as one of his sisters pays 2 house helps that make things very easy for me because my husband and I work 9-5. Also getting a house nowadays isn't easy.\n\nLast year his father died. Before dying he equally divided the property among his 4 children as this was their childhood home but it is an understood fact among his sisters that this house is ours, whatever the papers might say.\n\nHis youngest sister has a 5 year old autistic kid. After her father's death she practically moved into our home because my mother in law got severe depression. The house got pretty lonely for her, especially since my husband and I were out all the time.\n\nShe'd even stay for dinner as though it was her who was paying for it. She occasionally brought her kids with her and eventhough her daughters are incredibly sweet and even help around the house, her son makes me grateful I have no kids. I'd lock my room before going, but the rest of the house was never safe from this crotch goblin. My mother in law would never do anything and let him run wild. She'd say that her and her husband's pension was running half the house and she didn't mind anything he did. I lock my portion But I still live here and it's annoying.\n\nHe's getting therapy and the medical attention he needs to no effect. He makes loud noises and does all the things he knows annoy me Why not ask her girls to look after him? The eldest is 15.\n\nRecently my mother in law died. After the funeral was over though all The sisters are staying over just until all of them can get emotionally stable again but I decided to speak up now or I'll never get my home to myself. I told the sister with the kid that she's not invited anymore and I'm done with her kid. That it's my place now and no one gets to wreck it's peace. \n\nShe said that this was her home long before it was mine and she owns a portion in it. That she'll come by whenever she wants to. That I should just lock away my portion and whatever happens in the other portions is none of my business. In my anger I said that her rotten genetics are the reason I don't want any kids.\n\nI admit I might have crossed a line but she has her own home why does she need to wreck my peace? My husband's threatening to divorce me if I don't apologize. The other sisters have withdrawn their allowances and house helps, which I think is what bothers my husband alot because he thinks we won't be able to afford anything now. I told him that just goes to show that his sisters never loved him and only gave us money as charity. \n\nI think I should apologize because I don't want to ruin the family but I also think if I stay my ground, it would keep the sister away.

My sister and I still own 50% and legally there isn't anything he can do about it. I don't speak to him anymore because of his behavior. You're on the right track if you're aiming to lose not only your house but your entire family. Get your shit together. The world doesn't owe you a damn thing.", "YTA a 1000%. Don't  be surprised when your husband's siblings out vote him 3 to 1 to sell \"your' house.", "Wait. The other sisters pay, they help around the house, and what do YOU contribute? Clearly nothing. I hope your husband divorces you. Or the sister's sell their portion and force you guys to move.\n\nGrow up.\n\nYta.", "Yey, if I was the sister I\u2019d be seeing a lawyer. OP owns 0% of this house.  Force \u2018em to sale and then split it between the siblings.", "Sounds like you are not only the AH but an awful human being. The own the majority of the house AND they are paying for you to live there, yet you think you are entitled to the house more than they are? You are not entitled to the house at all! It\u2019s your husband\u2019s inheritance, not yours! You need to move out and get your own place and stop disturbing the sister\u2019s peace!", "YTA", "YTA. Husband should divorce you now that your true colours have come out.", "YTA!!", "Holy moly. You're TA. They lost both of their parents and you're concerned about THEIR house being completely yours? Your husband is right. You absolutely need to apologize to his sister. Maybe every sister since it seems you made them all very upset and uncomfortable.", "Jesus, YTA. Where do you get off being so damn entitled? Your husband and his sisters own the house, and as long as his sisters own the majority of the house they can come over to see their brother whenever they want, or better yet, band together to force a sale and buy your husband out of his share. Inheritance from his mother to him is protected, it legally isn\u2019t yours and you have zero claim to is as YOUR house. If I were your SIL and you spoke to me that way I\u2019d do my damndest to ensure your husband either divorced you or to put you and your husband out on the street.\n\nAlso - how are you both so seemingly broke when you both work 9-5?", "You don't own a house. You husband owns 25% of the house. Go crawl into the subbasement. YTA", "YTA. I have never read a post with that has made up my mind quicker on this subreddit. The way you talk about a disabled child is abhorrent. You sound absolutely awful. Enjoy your divorce.", "YTA:  \nNot your house. Not remotely your house.   \nAnd the way you talk about that child. YIKES. YOu know that if you have kids with your husband...same rotten genetics, plus your rude ones.   \nALthough I would love for you to explain to the class why you think you aren't.", "YTA.. and I'm not just saying that because my eldest son is autistic...   I'm saying it because you are the biggest AH I have read today.. yesterday.. hell all month.. ok maybe I'm a lil bias... But Congrats! That's quite a high amount of AHness considering this is Reddit..... \n\n\nThis whole post reeks of entitlement... And what doesn't reek of entitlement reeks of contempt of a child... Certainly not a good look for someone that is supposed to be an adult. \n\n\nDid you really suggest a 15-year-old girl try to take care of an autistic child? Is your head been in the sand the whole time that they have visited? At over 30 years old there are some days where the most I can do is cry... I would never expect a 15-year-old to take care of a neurodivergent child. It's probably a good thing you're not having kids.... You know nothing about them. \n\nNow onto that entitlement to the house.... Legally There is nothing you can do... Those sisters own three quarters of the house... Your husband  (Not you) owns one quarter. Not only should he be demanding an apology for his sisters, he should still be handing you divorce papers. You have shown some pretty nasty red flags", "YTentitledA", "OP, YTA, and you need to apologise. It's not just you that has to live in that house.\n\nAlso, this situation is obviously untenable. You and your husband should either\n\n1) Buy out the sisters so you own all the home or \n\n2) Sell your share and buy your own house or\n\n3) Agree on an overall sale of the property and split the proceeds 4 ways", "YTA, reading this was frustrating", "Guess what- 75% of the house belongs to others and 25% belongs to your husband!  Who the heck do you think you are?   Better start looking for a new place, because anyone of them can force a sale.  Your husband and you can PURCHASE it!", "YTA. I can't even begin to tell you how wrong you are about absolutely everything you said you did and still do in this post. You have no right to do anything to his sister. You barely have a stake in the property. You're a horrible human being for acting the way you are and I can't believe your husband didn't divorce you already. JFC.", "Wow. This cannot be real. From the ableism to the entitlement I don\u2019t know where to begin. YTA.", "YTA\nSo they all just lost their parents and your screaming at them to get out of THEIR home because you can\u2019t handle sharing a house an autistic child? And you seriously need to ask if you\u2019re the AH? YOU own nothing in that house. Your husband and his sisters own it. Your entitlement is blinding you to the actual legalities of your situation. If they wanted to they could force a sale on the house because they collectively own more of it than your husband does.", "Asshole?? No, you're just a horrible human being. Just so you know her autistic son is being an autistic kid. You should be ashamed and I don't blame your husband for saying he would divorce you", "YTA from the beginning to the end of this story. This is not your house, and assuming there\u2019s an understanding does not make it so. It is legally not your house. Also, the way you talk about an autistic child is absolutely atrocious. Get some help.", "YTA and an ableist one at that! \n\nyou have a strange setup but you said yourself, it\u2019s easy for you and yet you still feel the need to act entitled and unpleasant towards one of the ones who enable the easiness for you.", "How can she say it\u2019s her house when the sisters are subsidizing them", "Get some therapy and let your husband divorce you so he can find someone who isn\u2019t horrible and bitter", "As the most voted, you should cast your YTA vote.", "The more i read her comments the more disgust i am lol.", "Saaaaaaame"]}
