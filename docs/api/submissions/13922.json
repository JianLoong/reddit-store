We've never looked into moving out and never wanted to either as one of his sisters pays 2 house helps that make things very easy for me because my husband and I work 9-5. Also getting a house nowadays isn't easy.\n\nLast year his father died. Before dying he equally divided the property among his 4 children as this was their childhood home but it is an understood fact among his sisters that this house is ours, whatever the papers might say.\n\nHis youngest sister has a 5 year old autistic kid. After her father's death she practically moved into our home because my mother in law got severe depression. The house got pretty lonely for her, especially since my husband and I were out all the time.\n\nShe'd even stay for dinner as though it was her who was paying for it. She occasionally brought her kids with her and eventhough her daughters are incredibly sweet and even help around the house, her son makes me grateful I have no kids. I'd lock my room before going, but the rest of the house was never safe from this crotch goblin. My mother in law would never do anything and let him run wild. She'd say that her and her husband's pension was running half the house and she didn't mind anything he did. I lock my portion But I still live here and it's annoying.\n\nHe's getting therapy and the medical attention he needs to no effect. He makes loud noises and does all the things he knows annoy me Why not ask her girls to look after him? The eldest is 15.\n\nRecently my mother in law died. After the funeral was over though all The sisters are staying over just until all of them can get emotionally stable again but I decided to speak up now or I'll never get my home to myself. I told the sister with the kid that she's not invited anymore and I'm done with her kid. That it's my place now and no one gets to wreck it's peace. \n\nShe said that this was her home long before it was mine and she owns a portion in it. That she'll come by whenever she wants to. That I should just lock away my portion and whatever happens in the other portions is none of my business. In my anger I said that her rotten genetics are the reason I don't want any kids.\n\nI admit I might have crossed a line but she has her own home why does she need to wreck my peace? My husband's threatening to divorce me if I don't apologize. The other sisters have withdrawn their allowances and house helps, which I think is what bothers my husband alot because he thinks we won't be able to afford anything now. I told him that just goes to show that his sisters never loved him and only gave us money as charity. \n\nI think I should apologize because I don't want to ruin the family but I also think if I stay my ground, it would keep the sister away.

You and your husband live in his childhood home, the home was willed to your husband and his three sisters.

If I\u2019m understanding that correctly then you are without a doubt the AH. If you pay nothing towards the house, then you can\u2019t tell the people who do and who own the home legally what they can and cannot do!

YTA majorly!\n\nThat is not your home. This person grew up there, and was given a portion by her deceased family member. For you to act so entitled is insane! Your portion was actually given to your husband, not you. This comes off very ungrateful and controlling. \n\nAside from that, talking about anyone's kid like that is not okay. I feel the same way about children in general, but I'd never be so rude about a child, especially one that is a part of your family. \n\nYour husband would be smart to divorce you and ban you from the premises.", "YTA. Are you for real? You have no legal rights here. Your husbands family don't owe you financial support (or love, for that matter), and your hostility ends that anyway.

You are not entitled to your sisters-in-law's help paying for domestic staff! They surely did that to maintain the property and standards of living of their parents, not you and your husband.

Your entitlement and horrendous behaviour have led to you & hubby no longer being able to afford the house.

He has 3 sisters who live in different cities. We've never looked into moving out and never wanted to either as one of his sisters pays 2 house helps that make things very easy for me because my husband and I work 9-5. Also getting a house nowadays isn't easy.\n\nLast year his father died. Before dying he equally divided the property among his 4 children as this was their childhood home but it is an understood fact among his sisters that this house is ours, whatever the papers might say.\n\nHis youngest sister has a 5 year old autistic kid. After her father's death she practically moved into our home because my mother in law got severe depression. The house got pretty lonely for her, especially since my husband and I were out all the time.\n\nShe'd even stay for dinner as though it was her who was paying for it. She occasionally brought her kids with her and eventhough her daughters are incredibly sweet and even help around the house, her son makes me grateful I have no kids. I'd lock my room before going, but the rest of the house was never safe from this crotch goblin. My mother in law would never do anything and let him run wild. She'd say that her and her husband's pension was running half the house and she didn't mind anything he did. I lock my portion But I still live here and it's annoying.\n\nHe's getting therapy and the medical attention he needs to no effect. He makes loud noises and does all the things he knows annoy me Why not ask her girls to look after him? The eldest is 15.\n\nRecently my mother in law died. After the funeral was over though all The sisters are staying over just until all of them can get emotionally stable again but I decided to speak up now or I'll never get my home to myself. I told the sister with the kid that she's not invited anymore and I'm done with her kid. That it's my place now and no one gets to wreck it's peace. \n\nShe said that this was her home long before it was mine and she owns a portion in it. That she'll come by whenever she wants to. That I should just lock away my portion and whatever happens in the other portions is none of my business. In my anger I said that her rotten genetics are the reason I don't want any kids.\n\nI admit I might have crossed a line but she has her own home why does she need to wreck my peace? My husband's threatening to divorce me if I don't apologize. The other sisters have withdrawn their allowances and house helps, which I think is what bothers my husband alot because he thinks we won't be able to afford anything now. I told him that just goes to show that his sisters never loved him and only gave us money as charity. \n\nI think I should apologize because I don't want to ruin the family but I also think if I stay my ground, it would keep the sister away.
