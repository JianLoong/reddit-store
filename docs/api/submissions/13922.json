He has 3 sisters who live in different cities. We've never looked into moving out and never wanted to either as one of his sisters pays 2 house helps that make things very easy for me because my husband and I work 9-5. Also getting a house nowadays isn't easy.\n\nLast year his father died. Before dying he equally divided the property among his 4 children as this was their childhood home but it is an understood fact among his sisters that this house is ours, whatever the papers might say.\n\nHis youngest sister has a 5 year old autistic kid. After her father's death she practically moved into our home because my mother in law got severe depression. The house got pretty lonely for her, especially since my husband and I were out all the time.\n\nShe'd even stay for dinner as though it was her who was paying for it. She occasionally brought her kids with her and eventhough her daughters are incredibly sweet and even help around the house, her son makes me grateful I have no kids. I'd lock my room before going, but the rest of the house was never safe from this crotch goblin. My mother in law would never do anything and let him run wild. She'd say that her and her husband's pension was running half the house and she didn't mind anything he did. I lock my portion But I still live here and it's annoying.\n\nHe's getting therapy and the medical attention he needs to no effect. He makes loud noises and does all the things he knows annoy me Why not ask her girls to look after him? The eldest is 15.\n\nRecently my mother in law died. After the funeral was over though all The sisters are staying over just until all of them can get emotionally stable again but I decided to speak up now or I'll never get my home to myself. I told the sister with the kid that she's not invited anymore and I'm done with her kid. That it's my place now and no one gets to wreck it's peace. \n\nShe said that this was her home long before it was mine and she owns a portion in it. That she'll come by whenever she wants to. That I should just lock away my portion and whatever happens in the other portions is none of my business. In my anger I said that her rotten genetics are the reason I don't want any kids.\n\nI admit I might have crossed a line but she has her own home why does she need to wreck my peace? My husband's threatening to divorce me if I don't apologize. The other sisters have withdrawn their allowances and house helps, which I think is what bothers my husband alot because he thinks we won't be able to afford anything now. I told him that just goes to show that his sisters never loved him and only gave us money as charity. \n\nI think I should apologize because I don't want to ruin the family but I also think if I stay my ground, it would keep the sister away.

Nothing belongs to you. Why do you feel so entitled to things you haven't earned yourself? Consider some professional therapy.", "YTA. If you want your own space so much, go buy or rent your own home. You have absolutely no right to kick someone out of a space they own and you do not own. If I were your husband I'd divorce your entitled ass without even waiting to see if you apologize.", "Did I read that correctly? You and your husband live in his childhood home, the home was willed to your husband and his three sisters. You and your husband do not pay for the house, the sisters do, yet you feel like the house belongs to you and the sisters are not allowed in it. If I\u2019m understanding that correctly then you are without a doubt the AH. If you pay nothing towards the house, then you can\u2019t tell the people who do and who own the home legally what they can and cannot do! If you want to control who enters your home, you will need to move out and pay for your own home\u2026\n\nYTA.", "YTA - This HAS TO BE A TROLL!  If Not, EXPECT your SIL's to insist on selling the house for their 1/4 of the money, this is their legal right.  Either buy them out, or sell.  The thing that makes me think you may not be a troll is that you have indicated your husband may divorce you if you don't apologize.  NOT ONLY ISN'T THIS **YOUR** HOUSE, the 1/4 of it that HE owns is HIS, not community property - since it is an inheritance.  Which means, if he divorces you, you are out in the cold.", "What? YTA majorly!\n\nThat is not your home. This person grew up there, and was given a portion by her deceased family member. For you to act so entitled is insane! Your portion was actually given to your husband, not you. This comes off very ungrateful and controlling. \n\nAside from that, talking about anyone's kid like that is not okay. I feel the same way about children in general, but I'd never be so rude about a child, especially one that is a part of your family. \n\nYour husband would be smart to divorce you and ban you from the premises.", "YTA. Are you for real? You have no legal rights here. Your husbands family don't owe you financial support (or love, for that matter), and your hostility ends that anyway. They are all grieving their mother and all you can think of is how you get to call the shots now (which you don't)? I won't say anymore.", "Not only do they co-own the house, but *they were giving you money?* I assume that\u2019s what you mean by \u201callowances and house helps?\u201d And you still think you\u2019re justified in keeping them out of the house?", "YTA\n\nThis is THEIR home. No part of the home was left to you. Lol. Them coming to and from THEIR house makes sense. You and your husband feel no need to leave the home because the money his sisters are putting into it makes things easy for you\u2026.but that still doesn\u2019t make it YOUR house. It makes sense they put money into THEIR home.\n\nMove out, get a home of your own, and then you can remove people as you see fit. You\u2019ll get your peace too\u2026.", "YTA. Are you joking? I just read your side of the story and don\u2019t think anyone else did anything wrong. You are wrong to assume the house is yours. You were wrong to say such nasty things about your nephew. You were just wrong. Your husband is right\u2014you owe your sister-in-law an apology. You probably owe your husband one too for making such outrageous assumptions about HIS family home.", "YTA but this can\u2019t be real, no one can be this dense", "Jesus YTA and you don\u2019t even own the house it was split between the four siblings no wonder your husband wants to divorce you", "YTA. This IS NOT your home. You have lived there for many years with the (very kind) financial and emotional allowance of your SILs. You and your husband chose to move into the family home to your financial benefit but refuse to accept the very obvious stipulation that this isn\u2019t, truly, your home. It is the family home.\n\nThe way you speak on your in-laws, especially your special needs nephew, is a whole other kind of gross.

I have an autistic brother with some other issues and let me tell you, when I was fifteen I had no idea how to deal with him even though i tried my best to help my parents. No fifteen year old can, it's not the daughters' responsibility. And I saw you other comments, you're saying he's ruining the house. Do the sisters pay for the repairs?

Not even close. YTA. I can have sympathy for how difficult it can be to be around an obnoxious child that isn\u2019t you own. But you sound so spoiled and entitled. Fortunately a judge is unlikely to agree that what the papers say doesn\u2019t matter. Congrats. I have no doubt you\u2019ve forced the sale of a home your husband has only a 25% ownership stake in.

I hope they kick you out ASAP.", "YTA. You have absolutely no right to kick this woman out of the house she is an equal owner of. The way that you speak about her child is deplorable. And the moment you chose to attempt an illegal eviction, immediately after the funeral of HER MOTHER, was cruel.\n\n> In my anger I said that her rotten genetics are the reason I don't want any kids.\n\nYou were already at full abuser and now you've gone even past that.\n\nYou deserve to be divorced and I hope every last person in that family goes NC with you.", "Lmao another one who thinks she has rights to tell someone what to do with their OWN property. You are a total ahole! Seriously, who the hell do you think you are?? That man maybe your husband (I feel bad for him), but that don't give you the ENTITLEMENT to ban someone else from their OWN property. \n\nI wish I was her, because I wouldn't have been so respectful to you. I'll be damn if someone like you tried to kick me off my own property. Lmao", "It's not your house. It's your husband's family's house, and you are simply along for the ride. Your husband isn't even the majority stakeholder...\n\nThe sisters were helping to support the house as a family home. You've told them they can't be there, so why should they pay for *you* to stay?\n\nYTA on every level here. It's entirely possible that your husband loves his family more than you. You *obviously* don't want to be part of his family, so why should he keep you around? You are acting hostile and entitled and YOU are the problem.\n\nYou may say \"papers don't matter\" but I can assure you they do.", "I cannot believe this is real.  The OP is defending all the worst parts . . .", "YTA- You\u2019re sounding like the evil step mother in Cinderella, after her parents died. Her father left that home to her just as much your husband. Also that\u2019s so wrong of you to say his sisters never loved him. And to attack her son, \u201crotten genetics\u201d. How old are you?! Not acting like a 27 year old adult. You\u2019re letting GREED wreck a family. Check yourself before this gets worse! Maybe get therapy\n\nBecause you\u2019re going to lose it all if you keep thinking this way. Your husband already wants a divorce, that should be a clear sign to check your own actions. And don\u2019t apologize if you don\u2019t genuinely mean it. That\u2019d be manipulation.\n\nWhen you lose your husband and the house (that you never owned in the first place) don\u2019t go crying alligator tears to them or here.", "YTA and your poor husband", "I would say don\u2019t apologize at all and see if your husband is bluffing, hopefully he\u2019s not.

What makes you think you can ignore the will like that?", "YTA and you are awful!", "WTF did I just read? 1- you don't own the house, it belongs to all 4 siblings the same way! 2- one of your SILs pays for 2 house helps and you still think you are the one entitled to the house?? You sound awful and if you want so much quiet and peace, just find your OWN place.", "YTA, I can only imagine the manipulative actions you\u2019ve been running behind the scenes. Best of luck with your 1/5 of the house, or maybe it will be 1/10, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re going to be flying solo pretty soon.", "YTA.

And insulting their special needs child? Who do you think you are?", "YTA. The house is not YOURs, it belongs to your husband and his sisters.

Karma.

You are not entitled to your sisters-in-law's help paying for domestic staff! They surely did that to maintain the property and standards of living of their parents, not you and your husband. And you sound disgusting talking about this kid in such ugly ways. Why are you so hateful?! When the sisters decide to sell their shares of the house, you'll see how hard life is when you're not living such a spoiled life.", "YTA and a bad human being!!  I hope that if you ever become pregnant god doesn\u2019t give a child with disabilities because that poor soul will suffer.

That she'll come by whenever she wants to. \n\n*and she is right.*\n\nin the US, at least most states I'm aware of, inherited property with multiple inheritors is equivalent to tenancy-in-common rather than the standard joint tenancy/right of survivorship most couples take a home title as.  which means that legally, any of the 4 new owners could demand their dollar share of the property's market value, which would either force the other owners to buy out their share to retain the property or sell it to pay the proceeds.  without your name on the deed or in the will, the most you might likely be entitled (irony!) to are half of your husband's share of the *value of his portion of the asset,* not the asset itself.\n\nI'm not even going to address all the other bleeding red flags in this post, since my fellow AITAers have covered them rather nicely.", "YTA, the house isn't yours because legal papers actually do matter. Your entitlement and horrendous behaviour have led to you & hubby no longer being able to afford the house. If he doesn't divorce you, he'll probably loose the house, and he'll still be stuck with . . . you. If he divorces you, his family will probably start helping with the house again.

He has 3 sisters who live in different cities. We've never looked into moving out and never wanted to either as one of his sisters pays 2 house helps that make things very easy for me because my husband and I work 9-5. Also getting a house nowadays isn't easy.\n\nLast year his father died. Before dying he equally divided the property among his 4 children as this was their childhood home but it is an understood fact among his sisters that this house is ours, whatever the papers might say.\n\nHis youngest sister has a 5 year old autistic kid. After her father's death she practically moved into our home because my mother in law got severe depression. The house got pretty lonely for her, especially since my husband and I were out all the time.\n\nShe'd even stay for dinner as though it was her who was paying for it. She occasionally brought her kids with her and eventhough her daughters are incredibly sweet and even help around the house, her son makes me grateful I have no kids. I'd lock my room before going, but the rest of the house was never safe from this crotch goblin. My mother in law would never do anything and let him run wild. She'd say that her and her husband's pension was running half the house and she didn't mind anything he did. I lock my portion But I still live here and it's annoying.\n\nHe's getting therapy and the medical attention he needs to no effect. He makes loud noises and does all the things he knows annoy me Why not ask her girls to look after him? The eldest is 15.\n\nRecently my mother in law died. After the funeral was over though all The sisters are staying over just until all of them can get emotionally stable again but I decided to speak up now or I'll never get my home to myself. I told the sister with the kid that she's not invited anymore and I'm done with her kid. That it's my place now and no one gets to wreck it's peace. \n\nShe said that this was her home long before it was mine and she owns a portion in it. That she'll come by whenever she wants to. That I should just lock away my portion and whatever happens in the other portions is none of my business. In my anger I said that her rotten genetics are the reason I don't want any kids.\n\nI admit I might have crossed a line but she has her own home why does she need to wreck my peace? My husband's threatening to divorce me if I don't apologize.
