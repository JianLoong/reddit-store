The cause of our divorce was him cheating with a woman (f22). We have two kids (m6) and (f4) together. I have primary custody over our kids. His AP moved with him and his mom after the divorce and they have a 3 months old boy. \n\nMy ex and I still have to co-parent our kids so we are in contact regularly, we also live a few blocks away. Particularly as my own family lives away and I don't always want to bother friends or neighbors, I still call him when we have a problem in our home. I mean problems with the car, a faucet leaking, if he needs to pick up the kids from school because something came up to me, etc. \n\nHis AP has complained before, although my ex told her he had a responsibility with his kids and needs to help. However in the last few months she's been complaining a lot more. My ex told me this a few times, my ex MIL (who lives with them) also told me that AP complains all the time because my ex has to help us out sometimes and she has had to tell her to not get in between my ex and his kids. \n\nHonestly if she would just complain to him than I wouldn't care. But last Thursday I had to call him because our youngest had a bad cough, so I told him to go to the drugstore to buy some syrup for him. It was late, like 1am when I called him. While I was talking to him about what syrup to buy his AP took the phone and she had the nerve to tell me it was late and to stop thinking that her \"husband\" was gonna run after me wherever I wanted. I told her to stay out of it and to let me talk with my ex. She continued complaining and told me he was not gonna go huy stuff for me and if I needed something I could go to the drugstore myself because he's with his family and she and her kid need him too. She told me I'm \"monopolizing his time\". I told her that quite honestly I don't care about her or her needs, neither do I care for the needs of their kid. She called me names and told me I kept everything after the divorce and I still pretend I'm still married to my ex, she told me he has a new family and I don't know what else. I got sick and told her if she didn't want a guy with a family then she shouldn't have fucked married men, I told him that I'll wait the syrup and hang up. He did bring the syrup a while later so I was willing to let it go.\n\nMy ex MIL came to visit the kids on Saturday and she told me that AP got very angry and her and my ex had a big argument, she ended up leaving with the baby and hasn't came back. Later I was talking with my coworker about this and she told me she does kinda get AP's point And she told me I was kinda mean for telling her she's not important, especially since she had a baby not long ago and may be going though a hard time.

It doesn't mean you get your ex to come fix your car or unblock a sink. You may be coparenting, but you still need to solo your adulting. Tbh I'm kindof on the fence about the cough medicine. Why is you not having cough medicine on hand with 2 kids under 10 in the house his problem in the middle of the night? Yes they're his kids too, but it's your custody time and your house. It's very much actually your responsibility. \n\nFeels like you're basically using 'he cheated now he gets to be inconvenienced' as your coparenting guide and that's kinda toxic too. How much of this stuff would be obviously unhinged if he lived across town or further? Using your kids as a weapon against your ex is shitty even if he's an asshole.", "I\u2019m saying NTA because it\u2019s up to you both to create the terms of your coparenting relationship and he seems to comply with the arrangement of you asking for help. If he set a boundary that that was not an option and was inappropriate for you to call for help, then I would say Y T A. But it\u2019s up to him to set that boundary. You are not responsible for how his new partner feels. He has to make his own priorities. I just don\u2019t agree with other posters that you\u2019re violating some boundary when these are the terms that the two of you consent to.", "YTA - you are no longer married. When it is your time with your kids, their wellbeing and needs are your responsibility. If you need to fix a faucet, Youtube it and do it yourself, call a friend, or hire someone.

Sounds like everyone is an asshole here, though I'd only call the ex an asshole for the cheating. Everything else is just him being spineless.", "I'm gonna go ESH. Cough medicine isn't really recommended for kids anymore so it feels like an excuse that he needed it so badly.

I think this moves it closer to NTA for me personally, even though I do think some of the household stuff he does for his ex-wife is beyond the scope of co-parenting.\n\nMaybe the ex husband does things around the house still because he feels it's important his kids have a functioning household. If his wife doesn't have a working car, or the washing machine is broken, or the sink doesn't work, it's going to indirectly impact the kids because it's going to make it harder for mom to look out for them. \n\nSo if what OP said was true, and her ex really did say to call him when something breaks, I think it's not really the ex-wfe that's the AH. I think it's really an issue for her ex-husband and his new girlfriend/wife/baby mama to hash out on their own.

But if something that's more mechanically challenging is involved, and the ex is capable of repairing it, then I don't see the issue if both parties are ok with that. My perspective is, if I had children, I would do whatever I can to make sure they are as comfortable and safe as possible. If it means working on the ex's car so that they don't have to go without something they enjoy, so be it. The AP needs to understand that kids are the first priority. \n\nI for one applaud OP and her ex for maintaining this apparent friendship for the kids.

Lawyer here. \n\nI don't know what their custody agreement is written as but having an affair doesn't give the non-affair partner the right to dictate the availability of her ex when he doesn't have the kids. AP has a point here. I'm pretty positive a court would agree with this. When a parent gets primary custody, it is their responsibility to handle the types of things that OP is seeking help for. That does not absolve the father from paying support and taking the kids when it is his time. \n\nOP and father need to keep each other in the loop but calling the father to get cold medicine at 1am is not father's responsibility and OP needs to have another support system in place for that. \n\nFather was absolutely TA for having an affair and now is living with those consequences.

They will notice.", "I\u2019m ok with some pettiness but that doesn\u2019t make her not an asshole.", "While I do understand some degree of pettiness, it's not a great thing to display in front of your kids with your co-parent. \n\nSometimes, pettiness can easily drift into the realm of parental alienation. Which should be avoided. \n\nTreating your ex like your husband, responsible for the day to day functions of home maintenance is a bit over the top.", "Maybe that\u2019s not always an option financially?", "Specially those who cheat with a much younger person. Age gap relationships present a lot of challenges that the older person often doesn't anticipate.", "How old was the AP when this all started?", "OP.. i think you need to be careful about what you are expecting of your ex partner and co-parent. \n\nThat fact that he cheated is horrific and I'm so sorry you are dealing with the aftermath of his actions. That said, as primary custody holder, as hard as it can be sometimes, the responsibility for the things you raised typically fall on the parent with custody. Of course parents need to communicate and the like to make sure co-parenting works well enough. That doesn't mean that you can require him to drop everything at your beck and call to help you during your time. If this issue was raised in Court, I'm fairly certain a judge would tell you the same thing. I've seen this first hand in court my self as an attorney. \n\nPeople believe that because he cheated, he doesn't get to dictate anything. Unfortunately, even bad people have rights, and that includes in this setting a co-parent not being expected or required to do many of the things you are asking him to do. He needs to pay support, take the kids during his time, and the like but that doesn't mean he is required to jump up and respond to requests for assistance running errands and the like when you ask. AP does have this point. \n\nI would just be careful with this because if AP wants to fight your ex in court and forces him to handle things correctly, you may end up getting shafted from the help you are getting right now from him. You have every right to be upset and i understand how difficult the situation can be, but it is what it is at this point.", "Then the AP should be discussing boundaries with her partner, not addressing it with OP.

She can make him stop helping on any days where the kids aren't with him. He has his mom and his new partner with him while OP has no one near to help her.\n\nThat's all I'm saying.

Ex can also go to court to ask for a revised custody order if he is going to be spending more time tending to the kids which in turn would affect support and everything else kid related. We need to make sure all aspects of these types of things are discussed.\n\nI get you point and support OP personally. This has all the makings of lack of boundaries though. Regardless of the reason the affair baby was born, he/she is still his responsibility to. The ex needs to be more realistic about his time and ability to help and how that will affect his relationships moving forward.

They always get sick. Cold, cough, sneezing etc, come along every freaking year, many times per year. Whether it's allergies or a cold, you should have made sure that you have everything that you need at all times. When it's your parenting time with the children, it's your job to see to their needs. That's the joys of parenting. Stop calling your ex husband, unless it's an emergency. If Billy is going to the ER, absolutely call dad. Otherwise, you need to be standing on your own 2 feet.

But again, not your problem. \n\nAll that being said, obviously he should be doing normal co-parenting things. Getting your sick kid medicine is not something to be applauded. He's expected to do that stuff and anything less would reflect really poorly on him. \n\nAs for the household stuff, I can see why this is grey. But when it comes down to it, as long as you're not using it as an excuse to get him in your house multiple times a week, it's actually really good for your kids to see your ex coming over to help. It shows them that just because 2 people don't love each other, it doesn't mean that they can't respect each other and help each other out. Especially since stuff like plumbing and car issues indirectly impact the kids. \n\nBesides, if he wants you to stop contacting him about that stuff, that's his right.

It keeps his children in a safe environment and the repairs benefit his children.

It sounds to me like AP is young and lacks life experience and wishes for everything to go as she wants it to be.

Your ex is a grown man and can say \"no\" with his fucking mouth, she doesn't need to intervene if it was an issue for anyone else than her.\n\nShould you build a network that isn't solely your ex? Yes, absolutely. But are you wrong for telling her that her problems aren't yours? No. NTA. It's the truth, and she needs to understand it.

Now that you're divorced, ALL your home, car, and logistical problems are yours to solve all by yourself, without expecting any of his help. Same for his problems - he shouldn't ask you.

She sounds more jealous than anything and some of the stuff, like fixing the car, also impacts the kids. It looks like she didn't think through what it would be like to marry a guy with kids. I think she expected them to fall off the face of the earth once she had her own kids. She's complaining because she's not the center of her husband's attention 100% of the time since this is her first baby. She has to share and doesn't want to.

OP is overly dependent on her ex husband, her ex husband cheated, and the woman he cheated with is kind of a shit.\n\nSituationally, I do sort of find myself siding with the the AP slightly, but it's kind of irrelevant; the whole thing is a hot mess and weirdly I'm forced to give the ex husband a few points for possibly being dedicated to his children and willing to go a bit above and beyond to support his ex, but I also imagine it's slightly more complicated than that in reality.\n\nSo yeah, ESH.", "Agreed, ESH.\n\nI am actually okay with the home maintenance aspect, since the kids still live there and he presumably knows quite a lot about the home, assuming it is the same one they lived in together. Then again, my dad is a carpenter, and he would have sooner sawed his own arm off than have my mother pay someone else to come fix the house his kids lived in. So I may be biased. My mom did all the usual adult stuff, but she definitely got dad's advice on bigger stuff, referrals when needed, and help when possible. I think if both families are not super well off, it makes sense to have the dad help out. Car stuff is the same way. One the one hand, it is not his car, but on the other, no good dad wants to see his kids in danger because the mom had to choose between groceries and a needed car repair. If he can help out sometimes, that makes sense to me, as long as they have a healthy give and take.\n\nI had more of an issue with the 1 am phone call, especially if that sort of thing is normal for them. I get that OP had to be home with the kids, but if they are having late light phone calls all the time \"about the kids\", I can see a new mom having issues with that. The tone of the post (\"I told him to go buy cough syrup\" instead of \"I asked if he could grab some meds since I couldn't leave the kids\") makes me wonder if the issue is more that OP is treating the husband like an errand boy since he owes her for cheating. That would definitely set off the other woman, especially if he feels he can't push back without losing access to the kids. OP and the ex should discuss boundaries and make them more explicit.", "> literally the current wife was literally sleeping with a married man of two, like NOW she\u2019s concerned with boundaries????\n\nHave you heard of that new groundbreaking research which claims that \"more than one thing can be bad at the same time\"? Apparently not.\n\nOP's ex husband doesn't have an obligation to fix the car and whatnot. These are \"husband duties\", not coparental ones.

The needs of AP and her child are irrelevant to her. \n\nIt appears that OPs ex also places being a reliable father who his children can count in as a high priority. This is unfortunately not always the case when a parent cheats and divorce follows. But if this guy wants a future relationship with his children he knows that when the \u201cold children live in lesser conditions than the \u201cnew\u201d children, and the custodial betrayed parent is perceived by the children has having suffered from the living conditions that parent has been left in by the non custodial wayward parent, it usually results in those children going no contact when old enough to do so.  So ex has a powerful motive to behave the way he does. \n\nAP can be as pissed as she wants, but her quarrel is with her husband, who we can assume in general principles is a selfish SOB.  Taking her problem to the betrayed ex was about as ineffective and foolish as it gets. Appealing to OP as a mother?  Really?  \n\nFinally, I suspect that this is not a case of the OP wanting her husband back. On the contrary this reads as an wayward spouse who was busted and was denied reconciliation by his BS. And that his life with AP is a plan B. And AP knows it.", "A mid thirties guy groomed a girl barely legal...", "The ex sounds like a real charmer.

My mom was horrible about my dad, whenever she was mad at me, I was \"just like your father\". Ugh, it was very stressful growing up under her primary custodianship.  Dad was NOT like that at all and did his best; he never complained & never put me in the middle.\n\nYes, definitely do not add to the kids' stress.

It isn't as if OP wants him back.\n\nI also agree that it was really gross of him to have an affair with someone so much younger. Just ICK. \n\nI believe in peaceful cooperative co-parenting.

It will make you feel proud and impress your kids!\n\nKarma's a witch, seriously, and I really think the new Mrs has no understanding of what having children with someone else really means - it sounds like she thought her man was going to replace not only OP but their kids too.

She shouldn't be asking him for help with her car or her plumbing.\n\nThat is inappropriate. I would not be okay with my husband going to the mothers of his children homes and fixing things, nor would any other step I know. And frankly, the mothers wouldn't want it either, because a basic boundary most coparents have is that exchanges happen outside the house, either in the driveway or a neutral location. \n\nI've never seen so many people jump to this kind of defense before.

There's nothing wrong with still loving your ex, you were together a decade so you can't just switch off feelings even if he was a jerk, but be honest with yourself, this isn't just about your children. \n\nAs he's had a baby with this woman I can assume that neither he nor you would want to reconcile and even if you did, you'd have to deal with his affair baby and you'd never trust him again.

And it sounds like AP is actually \"wife\". OP needs to get over her ex and move on with her life, including being more self-sufficient. It will be healthier for EVERYONE.  And I say as someone who's partner of 8 yrs got someone else pregnant and left me for them.", "That should be a new choice on here.", "I mean...she called him at 1AM for cough syrup. That's not exactly an emergency or life threatening. I'm sure the child would have been fine to wait until 8am. And if not, ER sounds like it was needed  \n\nYou call me at 1AM -somebody should be on their way to the hospital or dying.", "Just stop calling him for house and car repairs. If it doesn't directly affect the co-parenting, stop calling him for things.", "People with kids split up all the time.", "Given that the other baby\u2018s mother and grandmother were at home with him, and he would have been asleep, the other baby is completely unaffected by his dad occasionally getting medication for his older sibling.\n\nThe ex won\u2019t get additional custody because OP occasionally needs a small favor for their kids.", "\"I knew it, I'm surrounded by AHs.\"", "Well, if her son has acted like this with these women, it sounds like MIL didn\u2019t set him up for success emotionally. He\u2019s not really committing to either woman. I suspect MIL wants to keep her son for herself, struggling to let him go in the first place. He got involved with women willing to compete for his attention while he\u2019s being avoidant to his current partner, whether that was OP back then and now the AP. When those relationships fail, he has to go back to his mom\u2026", "Side piece. Person a married person is fucking behind their spouse\u2019s back.", "Affair partner", "I think you're forgetting that this may not be the case where they live. Are you licensed to practice in Argentina?\n\nObviously her being rude to the affair partner is an issue, but where I live and with the families I've worked with, the judge would side with the parents who it seems have agreed to this arrangement. I am not a lawyer, just a paralegal who has spent some time working in family law, so maybe I'm incorrect, but I can definitely say that unless you are licensed to practice law in Argentina, you should probably not be giving a legal opinion here.\n\nETA: Additionally, differences can exist from state to state so generalizing it as \"in America\" seems to also be a bad idea. As an example (albeit not super relevant), the state I live in has community property laws, but most states do not.", "I was 17-years old and was willing to move across the country to live with a 35-year old and told him I would wear a shirt saying \"BOY TOY\" on it.  I even got severely depressed and retreated into myself for quite awhile after he broke up with me after driving to meet me *once* (and things in the bedroom didn't work out because neither of us had proper lube). \n\nI was 100% serious about moving in with him.", "He was already with her before the divorce, so ..18ish", "Ewe, I missed that. I was thinking 22 at the beginning of the relationship. If that's the case, I actually have more empathy for the AP. She's still acting like an entitled brat, but 19 can also be a really influential age (just starting real adulthood). And if that's the case, it's not OP and AP that are potential AH. Ex is creepy. (Sure, age of consent and all that but anyone under 20 in a relationship with a nearly 40 yr old is usually creep behavior).", "Same. Ex had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy. It's better to get over it and move on.", "Were you in a bad situation at home? Looking back, why do you think you wanted to do that?"]}
