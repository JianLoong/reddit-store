The cause of our divorce was him cheating with a woman (f22). We have two kids (m6) and (f4) together. I have primary custody over our kids. His AP moved with him and his mom after the divorce and they have a 3 months old boy. \n\nMy ex and I still have to co-parent our kids so we are in contact regularly, we also live a few blocks away. Particularly as my own family lives away and I don't always want to bother friends or neighbors, I still call him when we have a problem in our home. I mean problems with the car, a faucet leaking, if he needs to pick up the kids from school because something came up to me, etc. \n\nHis AP has complained before, although my ex told her he had a responsibility with his kids and needs to help. However in the last few months she's been complaining a lot more. My ex told me this a few times, my ex MIL (who lives with them) also told me that AP complains all the time because my ex has to help us out sometimes and she has had to tell her to not get in between my ex and his kids. \n\nHonestly if she would just complain to him than I wouldn't care. But last Thursday I had to call him because our youngest had a bad cough, so I told him to go to the drugstore to buy some syrup for him. It was late, like 1am when I called him. While I was talking to him about what syrup to buy his AP took the phone and she had the nerve to tell me it was late and to stop thinking that her \"husband\" was gonna run after me wherever I wanted. I told her to stay out of it and to let me talk with my ex. She continued complaining and told me he was not gonna go huy stuff for me and if I needed something I could go to the drugstore myself because he's with his family and she and her kid need him too. She told me I'm \"monopolizing his time\". I told her that quite honestly I don't care about her or her needs, neither do I care for the needs of their kid. She called me names and told me I kept everything after the divorce and I still pretend I'm still married to my ex, she told me he has a new family and I don't know what else. I got sick and told her if she didn't want a guy with a family then she shouldn't have fucked married men, I told him that I'll wait the syrup and hang up. He did bring the syrup a while later so I was willing to let it go.\n\nMy ex MIL came to visit the kids on Saturday and she told me that AP got very angry and her and my ex had a big argument, she ended up leaving with the baby and hasn't came back. Later I was talking with my coworker about this and she told me she does kinda get AP's point And she told me I was kinda mean for telling her she's not important, especially since she had a baby not long ago and may be going though a hard time.

If his wife doesn't have a working car, or the washing machine is broken, or the sink doesn't work, it's going to indirectly impact the kids because it's going to make it harder for mom to look out for them. \n\nSo if what OP said was true, and her ex really did say to call him when something breaks, I think it's not really the ex-wfe that's the AH.

But if something that's more mechanically challenging is involved, and the ex is capable of repairing it, then I don't see the issue if both parties are ok with that. My perspective is, if I had children, I would do whatever I can to make sure they are as comfortable and safe as possible. If it means working on the ex's car so that they don't have to go without something they enjoy, so be it.

Lawyer here. \n\nI don't know what their custody agreement is written as but having an affair doesn't give the non-affair partner the right to dictate the availability of her ex when he doesn't have the kids. AP has a point here. I'm pretty positive a court would agree with this. When a parent gets primary custody, it is their responsibility to handle the types of things that OP is seeking help for. That does not absolve the father from paying support and taking the kids when it is his time. \n\nOP and father need to keep each other in the loop but calling the father to get cold medicine at 1am is not father's responsibility and OP needs to have another support system in place for that. \n\nFather was absolutely TA for having an affair and now is living with those consequences.

Which should be avoided. \n\nTreating your ex like your husband, responsible for the day to day functions of home maintenance is a bit over the top.", "Maybe that\u2019s not always an option financially?", "Specially those who cheat with a much younger person. Age gap relationships present a lot of challenges that the older person often doesn't anticipate.", "How old was the AP when this all started?", "OP.. i think you need to be careful about what you are expecting of your ex partner and co-parent. \n\nThat fact that he cheated is horrific and I'm so sorry you are dealing with the aftermath of his actions. That said, as primary custody holder, as hard as it can be sometimes, the responsibility for the things you raised typically fall on the parent with custody. Of course parents need to communicate and the like to make sure co-parenting works well enough. That doesn't mean that you can require him to drop everything at your beck and call to help you during your time. If this issue was raised in Court, I'm fairly certain a judge would tell you the same thing. I've seen this first hand in court my self as an attorney. \n\nPeople believe that because he cheated, he doesn't get to dictate anything. Unfortunately, even bad people have rights, and that includes in this setting a co-parent not being expected or required to do many of the things you are asking him to do. He needs to pay support, take the kids during his time, and the like but that doesn't mean he is required to jump up and respond to requests for assistance running errands and the like when you ask. AP does have this point. \n\nI would just be careful with this because if AP wants to fight your ex in court and forces him to handle things correctly, you may end up getting shafted from the help you are getting right now from him. You have every right to be upset and i understand how difficult the situation can be, but it is what it is at this point.", "Then the AP should be discussing boundaries with her partner, not addressing it with OP.

Also, why should she care for his comfort when he's an AH who abandoned his family for a cheap woman? BS", "Cheating isn\u2019t a mistake. It\u2019s a series of choices to hurt and betray someone who loves and trusts you.", "I get your point but that doesn't change the fact that this can turn around on OP real quick.\n\nDEVIL'S ADVOCATE ARGUMENT: Suppose AP and Ex start talking and they decide to figure their stuff out. As part of that, AP decides to convince Ex to get 50/50 split custody. That changes the amount of support she would be paid as that is typically related to the amount of days each parent has. She can make him stop helping on any days where the kids aren't with him. He has his mom and his new partner with him while OP has no one near to help her.\n\nThat's all I'm saying. I never said OP was TA. I just trying to get out that she needs to be careful with the relationship with ex and AP as they can change her current situation towards their favor.", "It depends on how it's done or expected. \n\nHim offering to help is one thing. \n\nHer calling and asking for help or expecting that help is another. \n\nTiming also matters. \n\nIf he is already there for the kids, dropping off or picking up and the conversation goes something like \"I'm having problems with that leaky faucet again do you think you could help?\" Is much different from a phone call in the middle of diner demanding that a problem be fixed immediately.", "I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s a big deal that she asks him? He does have the right to say no, but he\u2019s not doing that. \n\nAlso, remember: she seems to have moved to be close to him and his family when they were together. Her family does not live nearby. Also, he only lives a few blocks away from her, so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s asking him to drive across town to come help her.", "AP can go to court and protect her interest in their child which can affect the way that OP's ex is able to assist her by changing his availability. Especially if he has split custody with their kid. Just because it is of his own volition doesn't mean its the right thing to do at all times for all parties. Ex can also go to court to ask for a revised custody order if he is going to be spending more time tending to the kids which in turn would affect support and everything else kid related. We need to make sure all aspects of these types of things are discussed.\n\nI get you point and support OP personally. This has all the makings of lack of boundaries though. Regardless of the reason the affair baby was born, he/she is still his responsibility to. The ex needs to be more realistic about his time and ability to help and how that will affect his relationships moving forward. OP also needs to realize that the current situation won't last forever and that level of help after divorce is not common, although i think its great that he helped the way he did despite the adversity with AP. He is still the bad guy.", "Honestly, I don't really understand why you'd even want him over for anything besides direct child things. The dude fractured your family. You could argue you had him help the first couple of times to teach you how to fix stuff on your own but a few times a month? I don't get it.", "Fixing broken house things for you is no longer his responsibility. He isn't your husband or your handyman.\n\nYou should only be calling him for things that are about the children.", "It kinda sounds like you\u2019re trying to get him back. You\u2019re a woman, not helpless. How can things break a few times a month? Look, the AP is trash for going near a married man, but you need to pull back and leave them to it, unless it\u2019s something to do with the kids.", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH. They sucked first and deserve to be put through the ringer some, but at some point you\u2019ve got to move on and take care of your own household. His youngest kid isn\u2019t to blame. Despite whatever he\u2019s done in the past, the only way to move forward is for him to split his fathering time among all of his children. His AP has some justification in expecting him to stay home for non medical emergencies. It sucks and I\u2019m sorry he cheated and ruined things, but it\u2019s done.", "agreed. Emergencies are ok when they are true emergencies. Not when you car doesn't work right, or you need to fix a fan or anything like that. That is not the ex's responsibility and that is crossing the line if it is happening. That is where AP would have a point. \n\nNot about the sick kid and medicine.", "I don't know what door dashing is, is a drugstore chain?", "It's not like he doesn't want to help her and she demands he does anyways. He told her to call him, and he helps out without complaint. I honestly think he might be doing this because it impacts his kids. If the house they live in has a broken washer, or a broken sink, or a broken car, it's going to impact them. I don't think him stepping in and taking care of these issues is an overstep on the part of the ex-wife. He offered this help, and he doesn't seem to complain or resist helping, and what he's doing benefits the kids.", "Yeah i kinda get it. It sucks when the kiddos are sick. And I couldn't imagine doing it by myself, when you were supposed to do it together, raising kids and so on. I really get why you are in a tough spot. Its more like I dont think you are totally unreasonable, this mess is not your doing. But even though its not on you, its still a bit much. The medicine i can understand, but you seem very dependent on him. And in kids related situations i get it. But not the everyday stuff. \n\nBut as a mother a 2 little ones I really get why it is hard to do it alone. He should help out when its emergencies and needed.", "I'm allergic to cough syrup and cold medicine, the struggle is real, but there isn't a cough or congestion so bad that tea, a hot shower/bath, or steam couldn't help alleviate.", "It was a light cough during the evening, it got worse during the night when he was trying to sleep. I thought I had syrup but it was expired.", "To get his raggedy example of what's not acceptable further away from her kids.", "I'm not condoning cheating. But I think saying they deserve no compassion ever again is just adding more pain. Forgiveness is as much for our own good as the other persons. \n\nIt'd be one thing to say, you want that person out of your life forever. But OP clearly wants the father around to help out with the kids and the house in general. You don't just get a blank check to make demands of someone because they messed up. \n\nOtherwise this is just going to escalate and everyone will be bitter and angry, and how is that good for anyone?", "They are not married anymore. That's why it's a bigger deal that she asks him, and IMO is her being too presumptive. \n\nAnd as for her having moved here... So what? That was a decision she made. It's not an excuse or free reign for her to call him over for shit that she could take care of on her own but doesn't want to/isn't able to, for whatever reason.", ">AP can go to court and protect her interest in their child which can affect the way that OP's ex is able to assist her by changing his availability. Especially if he has split custody with their kid. Just because it is of his own volition doesn't mean its the right thing to do at all times for all parties.\n\nHow can a court change his availability? What does that even mean?", "All she can effect in court is his access to HER kids. Also, most family courts prioritize the children and what is best for them so his access to APs baby and the baby still having contact with the half-siblings are unlikely to be curtailed by a court.", "I don't have any type of feelings towards him, I don't love but I also don't hate him, he just kinda exists. He offered to help with those kind of stuff and I don't know how to do them, so I just call him because I don't care seeing him.", "No I'm not. I don't know how to do those things since I never had to do them myself, he told me to call him if something broke and he'll see if he can fix them", "The AP was basically groomed by a man almost 20 years older than her when she was barely an adult (if that).", "Doordash is a delivery service. Mostly you get food from them, but you can also get things from regular stores.\n\nBut unless you live in Manhattan, it's not going to be available at 1 am. Ignore the other poster.", "Door dash is another type of delivery service.", "It's a delivery service in USA", "Does your area have Door Dash or something similar?\n\nETA like Uber", "You are acting like someone is holding a gun to this man\u2019s head. If he has an issue with being called at 1am, he can have an adult conversation with his ex. No need for home wrecker to be involved what so ever", ">They are not married anymore. That's why it's a bigger deal that she asks him, and IMO is her being too presumptive.\n\nHe also **offered** to help if anything goes wrong. So again, this is not just her. And it\u2019s not her job to keep the new girlfriend happy. \n\n>And as for her having moved here... So what? That was a decision she made.\n\nSo if someone gives up their life to move to be with someone, that someone becomes their support network, and they\u2019re tied to that someone via children, the person who gave up their life is just SOL because the other one cheats? I\u2019m sorry, but no. I do think OP should be moving towards more independence, but I do not think she\u2019s at all TA for asking that he help her while she\u2019s figuring all this stuff out.", "If he has custody of the affair baby and AP is not there  and its 1am and OP needs medicine, he will be in the same predicament she was in during her emergency.\n\nLets be realistic here, just because OP is the innocent party here doesn't mean she can't still get screwed by this. I see it all the time in court. People many times are morally right but end up finding out they are legally wrong. That creates so many issues.", "You should learn how to do these things. Youtube has great channels on how to change tires, plumbing etc.", "But you\u2019re not married now. He\u2019s moved on. The only things he should be doing is with the kids. You can\u2019t phone him during the night and get him round a few times a month to fix things. Learn how to do those things, watch a YouTube tutorial or something, or call a handyman. I don\u2019t even get why you\u2019d want him anywhere near you when he cheated and had a child with someone else.", "Yeah. True.", "Ah okay, I don't live in USA anyway", "I live in Argentina, not USA", "Him offering to help does change things. OP should update her post to indicate that's the case here.\n\n> So if someone gives up their life to move to be with someone, that someone becomes their support network, and they\u2019re tied to that someone via children, the person who gave up their life is just SOL because the other one cheats?\n\nAnd I mean... Yes? What's the alternative? It sucks for OP, I won't argue that it doesn't, but it is what it is.", "I don't call him during the night to fix things, I call him during the days in those cases", "He hasn't moved on. He still comes whenever she asks. Maybe he's trying to weasel his way back, maybe he's \"keeping an eye\" on her because he can't accept her moving on and wants to keep her dependent on him...\n\nMeanwhile, OP hasn't even considered why he's being so helpful to her at the expense of his new partner.", "But he\u2019s not your husband anymore. Why not call a handyman? Look i get that he cheated and that\u2019s awful, but it sounds kinda petty and like you are trying to wind up AP, which if that is what you want to do, then own it and say it.", "You shouldn't call him for anything unrelated to your kids.\n\nLook, move on, ok? You keep calling him and he keeps on coming, neither has moved on, both are fixated on a relationship that has already failed. This isn't good for either, but worse yet, this is terrible for your children.\n\nETA: ESH. While I agree that you're not responsible for the AP's needs and feelings, you do keep an unhealthy relationship with your ex-husband.", "Guilt probably, or maybe you\u2019re right and he\u2019s trying to worm his way back in. I\u2019d like to think she\u2019d tell him to F off. I wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with him, apart from kids obvs, after the way he\u2019s treated her.", "He offered - I see no harm in OP accepting his offer if it is done without a malicious intent."]}
