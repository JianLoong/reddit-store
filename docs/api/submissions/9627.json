I did check with people before booking the date and although we're still very early into the arrangements, the date is set for a Friday in August this year. \n\nI've told some people the date and my fianc\u00e9e has told her family, some people have made hotel bookings already. My sister is currently travelling and has been for the last 5 months or so. Good for her she's having a great time. \n\nThis morning I got a message from my mum saying that my sister is upset because she is supposed to be at a music festival (Wednesday - Sunday) where the Friday clashes with our wedding. The festival is around a 5 hour drive away and essentially a mini holiday for her. \n\nAfter I got the message from my mum I immediately called my sister. I apologised to her and told her that I'm sorry I didn't check with her first, I had just assumed that since she's been away for 5 months, she wouldn't have anything else booked. My sister seemed okay with it, she wasn't rude but a bit upset. We talked about how she's getting on with her travels as she's currently in the mountains in New Zealand. She's not going to miss the wedding all seemed good.\n\nI then called my mum and she was pissed, as my sister has been travelling, she's not had many opportunities to speak to my sister, most of it has been text. The first conversation my sister had with my mum in ages was essentially (according to my mum) my sister angry at my mum over the phone, blaming my mum for not knowing she was away them dates and generally just being angry and upset. This then upset my mum.\n\nAITA for not checking with my sister before booking the dates of our wedding?\n\nExtra info for anyone that can be bothered to read it:\n\nMy sister is going to the festival with 1 friend and she's worried about telling that friend about having to bail for some of it. She's worried the friend will then pull out of going. I have invited the friend to the wedding if it means that my sister still gets to go to some of the festival\n\nMy mum feels guilty (she shouldn't) and has offered to pay for flights to allow my sister (and friend) to get to and from the festival to attend the wedding. \n\nMy sister has been to this festival a couple of times in previous years already.\n\nINFO: my mum is annoyed at my sister and not me", "created_utc": 1676025551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yoqwz/aita_for_booking_my_wedding_without_checking_with/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just so I've got this straight...\n\nYou're engaged, and have picked a date for the wedding.\n\nLater on, you find out that the date you've chosen conflicts with a music festival your sister is going to.\n\nYou call your sister and she's a little upset, but generally okay with it and will make arrangements to come. \n\nShe was worried about letting a friend down, but that friend is also getting invited.\n\nBut now, your mother is upset that be resolving this issue, you've ruined a phone call between her and your sister by being the only subject of discussion?\n\nNTA.\n\nHonestly, from this it sounds like everything has been resolved as best it could. Your mother could have been a bit more chill, but it seems like there shouldn't be any major drama unless someone wants to make some.\n\nEnjoy the wedding!", "NTA.  If you have to accommodate people's schedules, where would that end?  You'd never find a date that's convenient for everyone anyway.  It's your wedding.  P8ck a date that suits you.  But a consequence of that is that if others have pre-committed to something else, maybe they can't come.  I mean, your sister isn't obligated to change her plans for you.   No use getting into a war over whether it's more important to you for her to be there etc.  I say stop discussing it, leave the decision with her now, and respect it either way.", "NTA a wedding takes precedence over a music festival and she can make her own choice about which to prioritize.

You can't make the dates work perfectly for everyone.

The fact is that these festivals happen every year, she has already gone, and you shouldn't be bending over backwards to make your sister happy or your mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have been more than accommodating, including inviting her random friend who is also going to the festival.

Kinda seemed the opposite with your couple comments about it in the post, and she was able to call you so I\u2019m guessing you could\u2019ve told her. NTA, but a little odd you didn\u2019t try to inform sister about the date I guess and I can see why that would hurt her a little since you did inform other people. But she can probably easily sell her ticket so I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve tipped the balance towards moving the wedding anyway. Doesn\u2019t sound like a once in a lifetime festival considering she\u2019s been before."]}
