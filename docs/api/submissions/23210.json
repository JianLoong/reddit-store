{"id": 23210, "submission_id": "15affbi", "title": "AITA for telling my husband he was cleaning the toilet wrong?", "selftext": "I (30F) asked my husband (31 M) to clean the toilet because I'm pregnant and throwing up often. For a variety of reasons that are equally our fault, the toilet in our master bathroom has gotten quite gross though we have kept the guest bathroom cleaned. \n\nI was frustrated that he didn't do it yesterday like he said he would (I've thrown up in a gross toilet twice since he said he'd clean it) so I nagged him to do it today. \n\nI'm in our room so I'm like 10 ft from the bathroom and hear him immediately start scraping the bowl with a pumice stone.\n\nI interrupted him and told him he needs to scrub it with the toilet brush first to get like the gunk off first and that the stone is for stains, kind of like how you would wipe crumbs off a counter before scrubbing any gunk with a scouring pad. \n\nHe got annoyed and said \"I know how to clean a toilet.\" \n\nI told him with how dirty it is going right in with the pumice is gunna get it all nasty and that he should do toilet brush first then the stone. \n\nI often find that he doesn't seem to know basic housekeeping skills but instead of taking my advice he insists he knows what he is doing. For example sweeping the kitchen before wiping off the counters or doing the stove before the microwave and the microwave bits getting on the cleaningn stove. He uses the wrong settings on the washer or dryer and frequently forgets to clean the lint trap. \n\nI dont judge him for not automatically knowing these things, we all had to learn at some point. But he gets so defensive when I suggest there are better/cleaner/more efficient/safer ways to do certain household chores. \n\nMind you these had been primarily my responsibility since he works more (I am not currently employed and before that he contributed more to the household financially even when I did work) but he is having to pick up some slack because this pregnancy is kicking my ass. \n\nI feel like maybe I can be too harsh but I also was very explicitly taught how to clean (I had a rotating chore list of about 2-3 hours of daily chores including everything from sweeping, mopping, bathrooms, laundry, kitchen deep clean, etc) and he was not. I wish he would defer to my expertise instead of just doing it wrong and insisting it's fine and he knows what he is doing.\n\nEdit to add: \nYes the toilet was dirty but not to the point of the pumice being necessary, IMO cleaner and a scrub brush would have sufficed. Kind of my point to my husband that he should have used a scrub brush first. For those curious about why a pumice stone would ever be necessary we have very hard water that can stain the porcelain around the water line of the bowl, not stains from the toilet being dirty per se.\n\nNever had to edit twice but pregnancy brain jumbles my thoughts: \n\nOveruse of a pumice stone on porcelain causes damage. Using it gently to spot clean the water ring stain is fundamentally different from using it to clean the whole bowl. I didn't make that clear and should have because a trend I'm seeing in comments is people asserting it is an issue of personal preference.", "created_utc": 1690400158, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15affbi/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_was_cleaning_the/", "score": 2176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wait until it\u2019s been done, thank him, and mention it later on that he could do it another way. It feels kind of shitty when you\u2019re doing something your way and someone tells you you\u2019re wrong right in the middle of doing it. If he\u2019s doing it in a way that won\u2019t work properly or that will damage something, like not emptying the lint trap, he shouldn\u2019t be getting mad that you\u2019re correcting him as long as you\u2019re nice about it.

So they place too much value on it, and immediately get defensive any time someone questions how they do that task.

That's how gravity works. It's so damn basic. Don't put delicates in the laundry and run them on permanent-press. Clothes get ruined. It's just. Not hard. \n\nAll of the comments on here saying you ask too much really reinforce the point of just how low the bar is for men. If your husband can't take basic, logical advice from someone who knows what they're doing, he sounds pretty thin-skinned IMO. I'm sorry you have to live in a half-cleaned house for the rest of your pregnancy. :/", "NTA! I have found what\u2019s helpful with this is my husband and I have to agree on a minimum standard of care.

I don\u2019t need you to show me!\u201d But obviously he did because the job was done poorly. \n\nShifting it to, hey this is normally my task I perform a certain way let me show you how I do that. Also setting the expectation that this is how we will approach things like this has helped him absorb that this is not a criticism, this is not something to be defensive about (this part has taken work and acknowledgment on his end). I found these things kept popping up as well when I was pregnant and required us to rethink how we approach these issues.

Since becoming a wife and a mom, I often go back to the phrase \"don't piss on the prize\". Moms often complain about how much of the household tasks, planning, shopping, etc fall on them and them alone.

If my husband is not causing harm and the task is just done a little differently than I would do it, I leave it alone. If something is going to be forgotten or damaged, I kindly speak up. Many men were not raised learning these skills and they are insecure about it. Allowing them to learn things their own way can really help them build confidence and ultimately take on more of the load. One thing I'm NOT ok with is the sulky, \"I can't do anything right so I'm not doing it\" approach. Nope, grow up and learn like the rest of us. \nI'm leaning towards maybe soft YTA.

Either way, this should have been hashed out before having a baby.", "Maybe ITA, but my policy is that if I'm doing something FOR someone else they can either let me do it or help me do it, but they can't criticize how I do it.

For a variety of reasons that are equally our fault, the toilet in our master bathroom has gotten quite gross though we have kept the guest bathroom cleaned. \n\nI was frustrated that he didn't do it yesterday like he said he would (I've thrown up in a gross toilet twice since he said he'd clean it) so I nagged him to do it today. \n\nI'm in our room so I'm like 10 ft from the bathroom and hear him immediately start scraping the bowl with a pumice stone.\n\nI interrupted him and told him he needs to scrub it with the toilet brush first to get like the gunk off first and that the stone is for stains, kind of like how you would wipe crumbs off a counter before scrubbing any gunk with a scouring pad. \n\nHe got annoyed and said \"I know how to clean a toilet.\" \n\nI told him with how dirty it is going right in with the pumice is gunna get it all nasty and that he should do toilet brush first then the stone. \n\nI often find that he doesn't seem to know basic housekeeping skills but instead of taking my advice he insists he knows what he is doing. For example sweeping the kitchen before wiping off the counters or doing the stove before the microwave and the microwave bits getting on the cleaningn stove. He uses the wrong settings on the washer or dryer and frequently forgets to clean the lint trap. \n\nI dont judge him for not automatically knowing these things, we all had to learn at some point. But he gets so defensive when I suggest there are better/cleaner/more efficient/safer ways to do certain household chores. \n\nMind you these had been primarily my responsibility since he works more (I am not currently employed and before that he contributed more to the household financially even when I did work) but he is having to pick up some slack because this pregnancy is kicking my ass. \n\nI feel like maybe I can be too harsh but I also was very explicitly taught how to clean (I had a rotating chore list of about 2-3 hours of daily chores including everything from sweeping, mopping, bathrooms, laundry, kitchen deep clean, etc) and he was not. I wish he would defer to my expertise instead of just doing it wrong and insisting it's fine and he knows what he is doing.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When my husband told me the reason that my computer was running slowly was because I keep ignoring the windows updates and that I need to stop doing that and I need to allow Windows to install updates I didn't take that as criticism, I took that as helpful advice. \n\nAlso, I'm not going to be thankful that my husband did a half-ass job cleaning a toilet that he uses every day. honestly I feel like I shouldn't even have had to ask him in the first place, he should have noticed that it needed to be cleaned and just done it like I have been doing for years.", "I didn't say you're doing it wrong. I said that he should use the scrub brush before using the pumice because the scrub brush washes away the majority of the gunk and the pumice is used to spot clean stains and will scratch the bowl if used to clean the entirety of it.", "Yeah that's called abuse.

That\u2019s not how this works.", "You don't want to know if the way you're cleaning damages your house?", "It's for hard water, i used to have to do it to our sink because the dripping (which i would ask my dad to fix but he wouldn't) would cause a brown spot\n\nThe toilet we just left alone because if you're looking in my toilet you can see the stains i don't care", "Just for another perspective, I live in a hard water area and have literally never heard of anyone doing this!", "This is a tough situation to manage - I had the same in my pregnancy; I wasn\u2019t sick but I could barely breathe or move (I had covid and then pneumonia and towards the end I could only manage to shower about two days out of three) so cleaning the house was out of the question. I was working from home and having had to give up going to the gym I wasn\u2019t really getting out of the house at all for the last 4 months or so.\n\nMy partner straight up hadn\u2019t realised how much I did around the house during the day and early evening while he was at work, and how much that enabled us to chill out together around our work commitments, until it suddenly stopped happening. And although he was a willing helper it was frustrating to have to coach and remind him constantly of tasks that weren\u2019t in his habit to do - but because he was only home for about half his waking hours and spent those hours mainly in the living room the mess in the bathroom and other areas of the house started to really depress me because I was tired, hormonal, and frankly I was working harder than I ever have in my life before or since and still didn\u2019t seem to have Nice Things around me to show for it.\n\nAnd it was visibly pissing him off that every time he did something that he was proud of a) thinking of and b) finding the energy and executive function to complete, I was making criticisms of the end result - and even to myself my nagging was getting annoying.\n\nOne strategy that really helped was just to talk about the chores in two lists: the needs, and the wants, and explain why things that seemed like wants to him were needs to me. Stuff like \u201ccan you please open the window above the toilet when you poop and then close it when you go to work because I\u2019m super sensitive to smells at the moment but I\u2019m also getting cold and can\u2019t lean forward far enough to close the window myself without gagging\u201d we\u2019re really helpful because to him, opening the window was a fair enough request but he couldn\u2019t understand why closing it when the house got cold was a barrier for me to be minimally comfortable while I was working.\n\nAnother thing that really helped was to try and make myself praise or thank him every time, and criticise only half the time. It made me more mindful of what I was saying to be able to think \u201cokay he did a shoddy job there but I already told him I didn\u2019t like the way he did the previous task so I\u2019m just gonna say thanks this time and live with it for a week or so until the job needs doing again and then give an instruction on doing it better *before* he started it the next time so that he had the chance to actually enact the feedback right away rather than being told that something he put effort in wasn\u2019t good enough and he\u2019d have to redo it immediately. This meant me living with some things that weren\u2019t perfect (and managing my rocky emotions over that) but overall meant we were more relaxed with each other and had more positive interactions, which was really important because with not having the energy to go out, he was the only non-work person I\u2019d interact with most days.\n\nEdit to add: NAH - you are more sensitive because of the pregnancy, and he\u2019s having to learn a lot in a short time and feeling underappreciated for the extra work he\u2019s doing because you don\u2019t think the results reflect the effort he\u2019s making, but you are both able to adjust to that with a little patience on both sides.", "He is an adult, with functional eyes and synapses, is he not?", "Youre a know it all about cleaning.

Because they definitely aren't. The companies that produce these products make them effective, not safe for the environment.", "Thank you for the explanation, I've never had this issue in my terlets.", "I\u2019m gonna fix this problem for women everywhere. I know y\u2019all just want us to listen and not fix, but y\u2019all need to know this.\n\nIf you have a problem with the way your bf/husband is cleaning or doing something, don\u2019t tell him while he\u2019s doing it. What women tend to see as helpful advice, men tend to see as critique, especially when we\u2019re doing something you\u2019ve asked us to do. For example, my fianc\u00e9e once asked me to sweep and dust, saw me sweeping before dusting, and then said something. My immediate thought was \u201cI\u2019m trying to be helpful, but I\u2019m doing it wrong. She thinks I\u2019m stupid/incompetent, and I am causing more problems than I\u2019m fixing as opposed to just letting her do it the way she wants.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t know what the root of the issue is, but I\u2019ve found that many man-woman relationships of any kind (husbands/wives, boyfriends/girlfriends, mothers/sons, etc.) face this exact issue at some point or another. It\u2019s a huge headache for both sides, because, in truth, both side have a point. The man usually is helping and trying to do it in the best way that he knows how/the way his brain thought was the best, but the woman is generally correct that there are more efficient/better ways to do it or that men might be undoing a previous chore.\n\nSo women, here\u2019s how you fix it. Don\u2019t tell him while his fucking up. Let him fuck up, just let him get all the way done. Now, there\u2019s two routes to go from here. 1)If a job is of pressing importance and not completely done, once he is finished, let him know you appreciate the help, and say it looks good except for one or two spots and point them out. 2)If he did a passably good job and the chore doesn\u2019t need immediate correction, just leave it. I know it\u2019s gonna bother you, but he will appreciate it and it will make it easier for you to get him to do it the right way. \n\nTo get your husband/boyfriend/son/whatever to do a job in the way that you want it done/think it should be done, regardless of which route you picked above, nicely tell him how you would like it done, in explicit detail, before he gets back to work on it. Most men are happy to do things a different way than they would have, but feel attacked or looked down on when the correction happens while he\u2019s in the middle of doing something. Giving clear, precise, instructions before he does a job give him guidelines for the job before he begins rather than switching up the guidelines partway through the job.\n\nAlso, lists and friendly reminders do help. I know that many women don\u2019t want to do things like this because \u201cI\u2019m not his mother\u201d, and you\u2019re right, you\u2019re not. That doesn\u2019t mean that everything a mother might have done for your husband (a to-do list with instructions if he\u2019s fucking up, packing lunch, explaining how to clean properly/why it needs to happen in a certain order, etc.), should you also happen to do them, would be \u201cmothering\u201d them. Lists and reminders (in a friendly tone, don\u2019t yell at him, talk to him like a person) really do help men stay on track and remember everything that needs to get done/how it needs to get done. He\u2019s not doing it wrong after you told him the right way to do it last time he fucked up to irritate you. He went back to doing it wrong because he forgot how you told him last time and his brain (incorrectly) filled in the instructions.\n\nNAH - he was trying to help, just messing up. Clearer communication really can help avoid these arguments", "YTA\u2026 woman here. I would have just walked away from every chore I was doing if you started correcting me on how I did it wrong.

You had me a little bit on edge with that very first sentence. \n\nBut I do think you make some incredibly salient points. I have seen a few people who recommended not giving the feedback during the task, and I do think that he would be more receptive to a different approach. \n\nFor me it was tough in that instance because I was worried about him damaging the toilet and making more of a mess in the process, and wanted to intervene instead of waiting to give the feedback after the fact, but I think people are generally correct when they said it's not actually that big of a deal or doesn't cause that much damage. \n\nI think the question I might need to ask myself in the moment is if the impact of me not intervening is more of an issue than the potential erosion of trust/his self esteem that occurs from me intervening. \n\nIf it's a safety issue, it's pretty black and white. The impact is more important than his feelings. \nBut in these gray areas where it's not an immediate safety concern or the impact isn't extravagant, I can absolutely be more selective. \n\nI will be perfectly honest, it is really hard for me to consider his feelings when I feel like he is overreacting to an issue that isn't personal. \nMe giving him feedback about how he does a task is not me saying that he's bad or incompetent or lazy, and yet that is what he hears. And if he feels criticized and like I'm implying that he's bad for the way he's doing things, that is valid. \n\n\nI guess I just don't really take it personally when I get feedback about the way that I am doing a task, I don't tie my value in with the way that I do chores or things that are pragmatic. I see it as an issue of a skill or knowledge gap and not like a deficiency of character. \n\nBut knowing that my husband does take it personally when he is given feedback about the way that he is doing something, even if I don't agree that it is personal, means that I can and should adjust my approach to set him up for success. \n\nI think we both have work to do, I think he needs to try harder to hear what I'm actually saying instead of reading in all of these implications.

In fact, she\u2019s usually quite impressed with how well I do things just so long as she\u2019s not around to actually see me do them. So if the job gets done to satisfaction, why should it matter if I do it a little bit differently than she would? It honestly just comes down to her being a bit of a control freak. She just has to micromanage every little thing and it honestly drives me insane sometimes.", "You're best talking to him about the way he receives feedback when you're away from the moment and both chilled out. \n\nI've learnt to pick my battles - using a pumice stone on the toilet when it doesn't need it would be a battle I'd pick. And tbh, so would leaving crumbs/dirt over the kitchen after saying its clean. (If it's just he has to re sweep or clean though I'd leave it alone as long as its clean).\n\nMy husband doesn't clean, dust or hoover as thoroughly as I'd like. I was constantly criticising him which wasn't fair, so instead we swap what we do now - e.g. if one week he's doing the kitchen I'll do the bathroom,  if he hoovers the downstairs, then we swap over the next week. I only try to point out stuff that's wrong if it'll have an impact on us.", "> I try to communicate my feedback without judgement. \"Hey did you know that if you...\" or \"if you tried it this way it might be easier\" or \"for future reference you might consider...\" What frustrates me is that it doesn't seem to matter how I approach my feedback, in the moment or at another time, emphasizing the impact of how the change of approach causes less damage, is safer, cheaper etc, removing value judgements and focusing on the practical, his response is always the same defensiveness.\n\nHeh, this sounds like me and my boyfriend. I was always trying to find the \"perfect\" way to respond. But that was a trap. There was no good way. If I didn't tell him something, and it went poorly, he would say \"why didn't you tell me?!\"... If I did say something, he felt undermined and embarrassed and got defensive really fast. Then he'd start arguments over it. Sigh.\n\nIt's a type of manipulation. When there is no \"safe\" way to communicate, you are being manipulated. The point is, he wants you to stop talking about all of this entirely and just lower your standards, or even better, take on all the chores. He doesn't WANT to have to keep his promises, he wants you to just give up and do the chores yourself to avoid having to listen to him complain.\n\nI feel like society has collectively gaslit women over this issue. I received the advice \"just communicate! women never communicate! once you do that, your life will be better and your relationships will be perfect\" early on in life.\n\nBut it was a lie.\n\n1) women communicate way more often than men on average, so that's just bullshit. 2) we need to teach women that when men ignore them, IT ISN'T THEIR FAULT. Cut it out with telling women \"have you tried using \"I\" statements?\" it makes me want to barf. You know what has never fucking worked in the history of ever? Coddling men and pretending they don't understand basic emotions.\n\nThey do, they just don't care. You don't need to start a statement with \"I feel disrespected when you don't keep your promises,\" ... they fucking know already. If they respected you, you wouldn't have to be on your knees begging for respect.\n\nWe tell women that all you have to do is craft the most perfect, least offensive comment in history, perfectly tailored to his mood (remember to only talk about it at the right time and not when he is stressed, too!). Be perfect. Talk perfectly. Use the right words. (And there are never \"right\" words. Everything you say will be picked apart and you'll be told \"you SHOULD have said this!\") Then, maybe, just MAYBE, you'll finally get your feelings/thoughts/observations respected. MAYBE, if you weren't such an annoying nag, he wouldn't belittle you and verbally or physically abuse you? Etc etc. \n\nThat's. Not. How. It. Works. It's not how it will ever work. God, I am so fucking sick of it. Sorry for the rant. I am just so sick of this. Walking on eggshells and being demure and polite has *never* gotten men to listen to me, not once in my life. I've spent years of my life going around and around in circles, trying to find the perfect way to \"solve\" an issue -- but the issue revolves around a man not respecting me. What I need to come to terms with, and many women do, is that you cannot convince a man to respect you with a perfectly tailored conversation or debate. If he doesn't respect and listen to you from the beginning, he never will. \n\nWe need to stop telling women to dance around like puppets and keep trying, over and over again, to have the same conversation that a man is avoiding listening to, and start telling them this. If he doesn't listen from the beginning, it's an issue of respect and value, and he'll never listen to you for the rest of your life, no matter how much you try. I am NOT saying this applies to your husband, necessarily. Just. In general. The hoops we make women jump through are fake, stupid, and pointless. Men are not stupid. They do not need women to be perfect, for women to deserve respect from them -- and \"perfect\" is impossible, because every statement a woman makes will be picked apart anyway, no matter how \"perfect\" it is. Because that's the point. Because it's manipulation.", "Don\u2019t armchair diagnose.

So I collect him from work and the ten-minute drive lets us gauge each other\u2019s mood, but if he\u2019s had a heavy day he isn\u2019t always able to talk to me fully so the feedback is often in the form of silence, monosyllabic responses or visible irritation with me talking - which is definitely rudeness on a neurotypical scale but though it isn\u2019t my preference (I\u2019d rather he used his words; he knows this and obliges when he can but often genuinely isn\u2019t able), I respect his obvious non-verbal request for a bit of space and quiet and defer all but the very most urgent of my communication until he\u2019s had time to shower, change, cook and decompress before we go into any demands for attention from me. I don\u2019t really consider my preferences to be important as long as communication is achieved effectively.\n\nSo I guess my tl;dr is that eedback doesn\u2019t have to be in a person\u2019s preferred format for them to respect and adhere to it, it just has to get the point across in a way that both people can understand and then mutual respect should allow the format to be overlooked.", "So, chem major here.
