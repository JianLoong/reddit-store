When your sibling was commandeering the PS4 and was not responding to you and your brother respectfully, you should have gone to your parents to mediate. Not to tattle, but a \u201cHey we\u2019ve tried speaking to [sibling] about getting a turn on the PS4 later and proposed 8PM. They are ignoring us and we\u2019d like to work something out that\u2019s fair for everyone. Can you help?\u201d\n\nName-calling isn\u2019t helpful and YTA for inserting yourself and escalating it to that degree. Your sibling is TA for responding poorly to a reasonable play time request and being intentionally petty by weaponizing laptop privileges. (Though that is within their right to do so as it is theirs.)\n\nI would encourage you NOT to retaliate by trying to ban them from the PS4 that is technically yours and your brothers. I would also apologize for calling them a bitch and for escalating the situation. Don\u2019t apologize because you want laptop use, but because you did something crappy and the person you were crappy to deserves an apology. I would then ask them that, in the future, they be considerate of the fact that you three all share the PS4 and should all be considerate of each other when someone else wants to play. I\u2019d point out that this is something you three are old enough to work out yourselves but that next time you\u2019ll get parents involved to mediate if they\u2019re going to respond as disrespectfully as they did today. (Don\u2019t mention use of their laptop or try to use it as a bargaining chip. If they\u2019re going to be petty and withhold it, let them\u2014it only makes them look like more of an AH.) \n\nEdit: formatting on mobile \ud83e\udd72", "ESH - I get the frustration about the siblings. I am a middle kid and most of gadgets we usually share. We are usually cool by that. Whenever one demands the gadget, we usually give it away unless we really need them and have specific reason. You shouldn't have started a fight honestly because they would give your brother the game after they finish theirs even if they say they won't. Your sibling is mature enough to act this way, tho. I think it is their way of letting you know that they are mad at you. If you go ask for the laptop politely, I think they will give you the laptop. Usually when these things happen, siblings tend to be mad for a short time and forgive very soon. The main key is communication, remember that. Try understanding everyone your point of view and they will also explain their point of view and that's how you all come up with compromise.", "Uh, yes YTA, its their laptop I am surprised they let you use it. I never used my older sister's laptop (well I did once with her permission). And my siblings never used mine. (Which I wouldn't let my younger sibling used, but would let my older sibling use.) Its mine. I get to make up the rules for it. Rather any else agrees or not.", "ESH  \nBut, more importantly, it would be a good idea to learn to stay out of your siblings' squabbles. I realize as the middle child you're used to mediating but that is not your job in life and you're actually keeping your younger brother from learning to advocate for himself or negotiate if you keep stepping in. Try to care a little less.", "Yeah, G/n was a recent thing they brought up wanting to be called, so I still need to work on not using gender specific pronouns, but I definitely should have more thoroughly checked, and reddits character limit made it impossible to include details for the squabble, but I did say I knew I was in the wrong for that after the fight and even apologize. I mean, I get it though. I already know I'm the asshole in that situation.", "Im guessing gender-nonconforming? Like non-binary", "Gender Neutral. They don't like she/her or he/him pronouns.", "The ps4 actually belongs to me and my brother, but I say ours because we'd rather share it, and while the laptop fully belongs to our sibling, I should have clarified that what got me mad is the only reason they took away my ability to use it was to make (what I see as) a petty point they wanted to make (Not to mention, sometimes they let me use it for school, being the only laptop we have, not specified in the post even though I probably should have). So I got mad, which I wouldn't have if it was for literally any other reason. They were planning to let me use it a week later if I hadn't confronted them about it. I felt like that was a really asshole thing to do, but since it IS their laptop, that's actually partially the reason I was wondering if I'M the asshole.", "There's missing contexts to explain why that's a bad idea. First they got mad at him for asking the questions in general when he was just asking if 8-10 was reasonable when we came home from school at 4:30, then blamed him for wasting their play time by asking. It felt rude so during the fight what triggered them most was me quoting their remarks when I responded back to them, but later on in the post, I go on to say I know how I was the asshole for escalating the fight at all, and apologize, at the very least, for starting the fight (I'm probably still an asshole for still think they were being a bitch, or so I'm being led to believe, so I'll work on that) but they still go on to ignore me and lord their control over their laptop to prove some petty point. And there's no way we could go to our mom since our sibling has way too much beef with her and doesn't respect a single word that comes from our mom's mouth. We would never ban them, and quite frankly, no body else in this house would let us ban them from our ps4, even if we ever had the slightest desire to do so. It was bought with our combined birthday money, and yet we still have to share it. Which we don't mind one bit, but we would never have the chance to be selfish about it anyways.", "Respectfully I ask, did you miss the part were I said I had realized I was wrong for having started the squabble in the first place, apologize for having done that (not for think how they acted was bitchy, but saying it after starting the fight in the first place)? I know I was an asshole then and if that's why this gets labeled ESH, then I don't mind, but it feels like everyone's missing that part.", "Yeah, I 100% get that, and that's actually something I've been working on. It's hard though.", "It wasn\u2019t impossible to include details of the squabble, we didn\u2019t need to know what time it happened, what game was being played etc. \u2018our sibling was already playing Red Dead online with their posse members\u2019 = \u2018our sibling was already playing\u2019.  \u2018he returns with the proposal\u2019 = \u2018he said\u2019. \u2018With some deliberating and thinking time to myself, I knew I was in the wrong for starting the fight because Ive had bad days too\u2019 = \u2018I realised afterwards I was wrong\u2019. The entire sentence when you complain about the character limit: not needed, we know. \n\nJust the facts, ma\u2019am, as the saying goes. \n\nIf you phrase succinctly instead of as though you are chatting, it is possible to get the information across.", "Ah i read over the part of you already realizing, my apologies for that, I shouldn't have been harsh if it did come across that way. \n\nBut yes, check! Being trans myself I do understand it's hard, especially when only recently spoken about, but even trying goes a long way", "And still you call them her and a bitch. \n\n\n\nYou are an ahole for that too.", "Well if its 100% theirs, I'm guessing they paid for it themselves, then they can do whatever they want with it.  Maybe save up to get your own or see if you can borrow a schools one.", "Oh, I know. We didn't have a middle child in my family so we had to police things ourselves, but then we were very close in age. I do think 21 years old is a bit too old to be squabbling over a PS4. I'd call your older sibling immature. But think what might be different if there had only been the two of them. It's possible they would have learned to work things out on their own.", "Yeah I'm starting to realize that now, but it feels to late to change it and I'm bad at formatting.", "I definitely should have checked it a bit more thoroughly before post, but it was a recent development and as someone with ADHD and having lived with them fore 18 years, it's hard to break the habit of referring to their original gender pronouns. I edited it though, their shouldn't be any gender specific pronouns for them. Thank you for pointing that out.", "you left the name calling in. \n\n\n\nIf you want to claim to be so mature and your apology sooo heart, you might also want to edit out calling them here a bitch AGAIN. Lol\n\n\nYou called them a bitch even though you know it is not tolerated.\n\n\nYou apologised \"heart felt\" over text.\n\n\nYou didnt get what you wanted out of them and went straight back to callem them that. \n\n\nYou really seem sorry and working on your behaviour/s", "I took that out, only because I didn't want people misunderstanding me the way you did. I apologized to them for starting the fight and keeping it going instead of letting it go and leaving it at that. That was wrong of me. Being in a bad moods and taking it out on our brother doesn't make them any less of a bitch. I do think they were being a bitch, the point of this was whether me calling them a bitch warranted them not letting me use their laptop for a week just to prove that's what a bitch does. Though Reddit made it difficult to include the fight, if not impossible which would've been useful for context. So, I guess, Without better context, I understand why I'm being labeled the asshole.", "Wtf\n\n\n\"Am I the ahole for calling my sibling a bitch?\"\n\n\n\"Yes you are and you are still calling them that and it is not ok\"\n\n\n\"You misunderstood. They are a bitch and I I think I'm right, but you just don't get it.\"\n\n\nI don't misunderstand. You are just an ahole.", "The title says AITA For getting mad at my sibling for banning me from their laptop. Not AITA for calling them a bitch. Idk where you got that, but If I find it, I'll edit it out. Plus, calling someone a bitch or name calling doesn't automatically make someone an asshole.... Idk, you're a little confusing. But, I'll stop calling them a bitch."]}
