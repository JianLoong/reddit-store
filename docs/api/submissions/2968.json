As soon as I close my door my roommate knocks on my door and tells me that when I let her out, that she goes and wakes her up. She then continues to say that she\u2019s HER therapy cat and she\u2019s already done all the paperwork to take ownership. I was speechless. We hadn\u2019t even had the conversation of who would get her when we parted ways.

I keep thinking about just taking her but I don\u2019t know if there would be legal ramifications?", "Honestly I just thought she owed me the decency of asking me to watch ~her~ cat.

Definitely wanted to but I didn\u2019t. The worst comments I made back were when she said she could move out tomorrow and take all her dishes and I would have to eat off the floor to which I responded that I hope she does because we are obviously not in a healthy environment. And when she said my friends were emotionally immature I said that that was rich coming from her. She said that I was raised by two narcissists (literally no diagnosis, my parents were just\u2026..you know middle class 80s people\u2026if that helps) and so being raised by two narcissist gave me the tendencies. I think it\u2019s more because for the first two years that we lived together I cleaned up everything. We moved in together nov 2019, then with COVID she wasn\u2019t going to school anymore and didn\u2019t have a job but still I was the only one who cleaned the whole apartment, the one one who did the dishes (even when our dishwasher broke I washed all of hers by hand because I just didn\u2019t like the mess and she\u2019d leave them for days). I didn\u2019t really have any practice setting boundaries and was kind of a doormat. But within the last year, I\u2019ve stopped cleaning up after her. And I graduated and accepted a job in a different state and she came too. And I started making more friends and spending less time with her. And less time cleaning and things. \n\nI\u2019m doing all the cares but the cat is a beautiful perfect angel, anyone would want her. My roommate definitely pets her and cuddles and things. And it changes, sometimes her door is all the way shut, sometimes it\u2019s cracked open enough for the cat to sneak in and out. For a while she had it closed at night, but recently it\u2019s been cracked back open again. I did phrase that confusing, it\u2019s been metaphorically shut for the past few months, and actually shut shut probably 65% of that time. \n\nI\u2019ve mostly paid for the food and litter because I know when they\u2019re running low.", "I worked in a vet shop for a long time. If you have copies of the vet bills with your name listed as the owner, then you are the owner.  This is especially true if you have city licenses or a microchip in your name. If your cat is not already chipped, I would do that immediately. Having a chip that states you are the owner is enough to get the matter thrown out if it goes to court in most places. In the unlikely even she tries to pursue legal action don't panic, just sent copies of the vet bills, city license, and chip record to her attorney and the case will get dropped. When push comes to shove the person who is on record as paying the bills is the person who owns the cat. I've seen a lot of messy divorces and it's always the person paying the bills that owns the animal.\n\nYou are NTA by the way. You were fortunate to have this come up so you can be prepared for any messiness that ensues.", "Get the vet records showing you took her in. Get bank statements. Go get cat microchip with your information.", "Honestly, after the stunt she pulled, at minimum, ask to be paid to watch the cat. Don't let her walk all over you just because you like the cat.", "That might be true but OP should at least try.", "Fair enough.  Sounds like she is just throwing out hurtful words because she's mad she can't treat you like a doormat anymore.  NTA.\n\nLook up the grey rock technique to deal with her. Don't give her any information about you or what you are doing. If she gets volatile, tell her that you won't be spoken to in that manner. If she won't speak to you in a civil manner, you will leave. That is your boundary. Enforce it.  If you have to stay there for any length of time, get a lock on your door so she can't get in. Do not engage except to discuss move out logistics*.  At this point in time, I would stop using anything that is hers. Plates? Buy paper.  You can write her a letter or email outlining that your things are off limits and state hers will not be used by you. State outright that you will no longer be caring for \"her\" cat.  If you find that she is neglecting said cat, you will seek ownership of the cat.  She is now 100% responsible for buying all care items, feeding, watering, and vet care.  But you will also not let the cat be neglected. So if you see that happening, it will be documented and grounds for you to take ownership.  This needs to be in writing. If possible, have a witness there to see you give it to her.  CYA and all. \n\nThis isn't about being petty.  This is about protecting yourself.\n\nI would recommend therapy to avoid being taken advantage of in the future and to learn about setting healthy boundaries. But then, I recommend everyone goes to therapy. It's very enlightening.\n\nEdit: typos", "When I read about \"doing paperwork\" to take ownership of the cat, I could only think, \"That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.\"\n\nShe did say the roommate's parents paid a vet bill, so maybe it's legally their cat?", "What happens when the roommate refuses to pay? OP is going to feed the cat no matter what, so it's not worth the drama. She does need to think about whether the cat will be cared for after she moves out & if she's not sure, do whatever she needs to do to take the cat with her.", "If they are already NC then there\u2019s no point. The roommate seems to freeze her out until she wants to verbally attack her. And when they do talk the roommate does a huge dump of past incidents on her.\n\nThem communicating civilly and compromising is over. She needs to cut ties ASAP and move on.", "I\u2019ll definitely look that up thank you for that! Thank you for all of the advice, that\u2019s very thorough. I have (finally haha) started going to therapy! I started this year and have been working really hard\u2026I\u2019ve finally started setting boundaries and things. And I will say every time I dig in my heels it makes things worse between us which I guess says something.", "I bet she\u2019s getting paperwork from a therapist on the cat being an emotional support cat. But that doesn\u2019t mean this cat is legally her cat.", "You don\u2019t understand, if I keep talking to the wall, eventually it will move. \n\n(please send help, it\u2019s been 2 months and the wall still won\u2019t let me leave.)"]}
