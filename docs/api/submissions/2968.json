Definitely wanted to but I didn\u2019t. The worst comments I made back were when she said she could move out tomorrow and take all her dishes and I would have to eat off the floor to which I responded that I hope she does because we are obviously not in a healthy environment. And when she said my friends were emotionally immature I said that that was rich coming from her. She said that I was raised by two narcissists (literally no diagnosis, my parents were just\u2026..you know middle class 80s people\u2026if that helps) and so being raised by two narcissist gave me the tendencies. I think it\u2019s more because for the first two years that we lived together I cleaned up everything. We moved in together nov 2019, then with COVID she wasn\u2019t going to school anymore and didn\u2019t have a job but still I was the only one who cleaned the whole apartment, the one one who did the dishes (even when our dishwasher broke I washed all of hers by hand because I just didn\u2019t like the mess and she\u2019d leave them for days). I didn\u2019t really have any practice setting boundaries and was kind of a doormat. But within the last year, I\u2019ve stopped cleaning up after her. And I graduated and accepted a job in a different state and she came too. And I started making more friends and spending less time with her. And less time cleaning and things. \n\nI\u2019m doing all the cares but the cat is a beautiful perfect angel, anyone would want her. My roommate definitely pets her and cuddles and things. And it changes, sometimes her door is all the way shut, sometimes it\u2019s cracked open enough for the cat to sneak in and out. For a while she had it closed at night, but recently it\u2019s been cracked back open again. I did phrase that confusing, it\u2019s been metaphorically shut for the past few months, and actually shut shut probably 65% of that time. \n\nI\u2019ve mostly paid for the food and litter because I know when they\u2019re running low.", "I worked in a vet shop for a long time. If you have copies of the vet bills with your name listed as the owner, then you are the owner.  This is especially true if you have city licenses or a microchip in your name. If your cat is not already chipped, I would do that immediately. Having a chip that states you are the owner is enough to get the matter thrown out if it goes to court in most places. In the unlikely even she tries to pursue legal action don't panic, just sent copies of the vet bills, city license, and chip record to her attorney and the case will get dropped. When push comes to shove the person who is on record as paying the bills is the person who owns the cat. I've seen a lot of messy divorces and it's always the person paying the bills that owns the animal.\n\nYou are NTA by the way. You were fortunate to have this come up so you can be prepared for any messiness that ensues.", "Get the vet records showing you took her in. Get bank statements. Go get cat microchip with your information.", "Honestly, after the stunt she pulled, at minimum, ask to be paid to watch the cat. Don't let her walk all over you just because you like the cat.", "That might be true but OP should at least try.", "Fair enough.  Sounds like she is just throwing out hurtful words because she's mad she can't treat you like a doormat anymore.  NTA.\n\nLook up the grey rock technique to deal with her. Don't give her any information about you or what you are doing. If she gets volatile, tell her that you won't be spoken to in that manner. If she won't speak to you in a civil manner, you will leave. That is your boundary. Enforce it.  If you have to stay there for any length of time, get a lock on your door so she can't get in. Do not engage except to discuss move out logistics*.  At this point in time, I would stop using anything that is hers. Plates? Buy paper.  You can write her a letter or email outlining that your things are off limits and state hers will not be used by you. State outright that you will no longer be caring for \"her\" cat.  If you find that she is neglecting said cat, you will seek ownership of the cat.  She is now 100% responsible for buying all care items, feeding, watering, and vet care.  But you will also not let the cat be neglected. So if you see that happening, it will be documented and grounds for you to take ownership.  This needs to be in writing. If possible, have a witness there to see you give it to her.  CYA and all. \n\nThis isn't about being petty.  This is about protecting yourself.\n\nI would recommend therapy to avoid being taken advantage of in the future and to learn about setting healthy boundaries.

But your roommate is delusional. You don't fill out paperwork to magically \"take ownership\" of someone else's cat. You've been taking care of her. That's your cat. Take her to the vet and get her microchipped, and consider leaving her with family until you can move out on your own. Don't give your roommate a chance to steal your cat.", "Now, I\u2019m talking from the perspective from someone who has a service dog who was trained by a non-profit. I\u2019m very familiar with the ADA and with the rules around service animals and emotional support animals. \n\nIn the USA (which it seems like you\u2019re in), there is no registration or overarching governing rules for service dogs or ESAs. The ADA protects service animals and the Fair Housing Act protects service and assistance/therapy/emotional support animals from being denied residence and from being charged for their presence. The difference between service animals and assistance or therapy animals is that a service animal performs specific tasks to help a person navigate the world. An assistance or therapy animal (gonna just say therapy from now on) provides comfort and their presence, but they don\u2019t perform specific tasks. You can take a service animal with you anywhere except a couple restricted spots, but a therapy animal can\u2019t go anywhere. \n\nSo her comment on paperwork either means that she\u2019s getting a letter, prescription, or notice from a licensed therapist or psychiatrist\u2026 or she\u2019s been pulled into one of the scam registration things on the internet. Getting the letter is perfectly valid, but it only gives her the right to have an animal in her home- it doesn\u2019t mean that the cat you two have right now is hers because she \u201cneeds it for therapy\u201d. \n\nGiven that you have put the bulk of the care and money into this cat, you do have a higher claim. I agree with others that asking a friend to care for the cat in the weeks following her visit to her family until you move out is a very smart move. As is getting her chipped- it won\u2019t cost much and registration of the chip is usually straight forward. She\u2019s trying to bully you again and get you to give up the cat without argument. The whole \u201cpaperwork\u201d thing is a smoke screen. Good luck. NTA", "NTA but you don't have to cave and let her take the cat because her parents paid one bill.\n\nWho signed the adoption agreement?\n\nWho's name is on the account at the vets office?\n\nThese two pieces of information are how you prove ownership, not who pays for things.", "NTA, and there is some serious fucking projection going on here. Your roomie is full on throwing everything they are doing to you back in your face. Your best option here is to continue LC until lease is up and then run like hell to get away from them. \n\nMake sure anything valuable is already removed from the apartment. Keep nothing there you can't afford to leave(emotionally or financially). Once you have settled all debts/costs, cut her off. The cat will likely be a loss, and it sucks. You can try to recoup costs, but not likely to happen.", "NTA. Her cat, her responsibility.", "Look into small claims court as an option.  \nIf you have or can get receipts that show you covered the costs you did for the cat, now is the time to do so and to build your case.  Find a temporary home for the cat until this is settled.  The idea is to ensure she has to prove her ownership. Take the cat to the vet to be scanned for a chip. If she isn\u2019t chipped, get that taken care of ASAP. \n\nWrite down what she said to you about taking the cat and be precise about the date and time.

Are you committed to letting her keep the cat?\n\nIf you're giving up and letting her have the cat, you're N TA for making a realistic statement about watching the cat. Her assuming you would do it because she's depending on how much you care for the cat is pure BS. \n\nIf you are interested in keeping the cat, making such comments is basically hostage-taking and I don't think that's what you want to do.

I don't suppose you'd consider using the opportunity of helping her out by taking care of 'her' cat for Thanksgiving as a chance to start talking again? I've had my share of bad roommates, and often the true issue was escalation caused by a lack of communication. It seems here that both parties have made up their mind about what the other thinks without actually talking to one another outside of explosive arguments. \n\nUltimately NTA, but for your peace of mind, I suggest trying to mend some bridges, if only for the cat.
