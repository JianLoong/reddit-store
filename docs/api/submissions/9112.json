You can't really process information or be thoughtful when you've got a bunch of adrenaline going. \n\n\n\nSo a lot of the strategies we use to calm down -- breathing, drinking water or having a snack, grounding exercises, etc -- have the effect of calming down our SNS and letting our PNS take the lead. \n\n\nThe point is that when you're stressed out, it's not a moral failing or something you can grit your teeth and get through - it's an automatic, uncontrollable physiological response. Rather than trying to white knuckle through stress, we find it's more effective to take a step back and use some calming strategies. \n\n\nIt's also helpful to pay attention to your own signals and get in the habit of noticing when you're adrenaline-ey -- nobody makes their best decisions in that state. It's also helpful to notice others' signals, so we don't inadvertently send them into fight or flight.\n\n\nI'm having trouble gaging appropriateness or whatever but it's a bummer that this presenter couldn't deliver this information in a way that was effective for you. I'm wondering of their own stress responses were getting activated and if they were starting to struggle with the pressure.

It is also considered quite unprofessional since in most graduate courses the professors treat you like more like a colleague.\n\nETA: It does depend on the size of the lecture though.

So they were just interrupting to insert their own opinions into the lecture. \n\nAlso (at the v least this is how it\u2019s done here), at a postgraduate level we had multiple readings to complete before the lecture and our seminars. The lecture would touch on the same concepts presented in the reading more in-depth, and then the group seminar after the lecture we would again further discuss the topic to a new level of depth/look at specific further examples or whatever. \n\nInterrupting a lecture because you\u2019re confused is not be an appropriate moment to ask. Each student has the opportunity to discuss with peers in advance, with a professor during their office hours, approaching the lecturer immediately *after* the lecture, or bringing something up for discussion during a seminar. Also if you\u2019re that confused by something in the lecture, it just conveys that you didn\u2019t prepare appropriately in advance, thus dragging down everyone else\u2019s time who showed up prepared to engage in the discussion.

I don't think it's as common as you believe it is. In fact, most of them preferred open discussion about the material as it engaged the students. It's been found to be more effective than lecturing.", "I was a prof for 15 years teaching at 3 different unis. Pretty sure I know what I'm talking about. When you're talking about a class of a 100 students or more, some profs leave the questions for the end to ensure they cover all the material they need to for the entire class and some, as I said, insist questions and discussions are only part of recitation not the lecture. But ultimately it's up to the prof to decide how best to cover the material and respond to questions regardless of \"what's been found.\" (Citation needed)"]}
