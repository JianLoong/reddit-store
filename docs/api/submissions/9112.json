I have advanced education in neuroscience, and I can explain this- but SO CAN MY YOGA teacher- who has read a few books (and so can EVERY single person I know who can legally called themselves a psychologist- this is literally Psych 100/101 level stuff).\n\nThe presenter sounds like a nincompoop. Maybe the OP was obnoxious- or maybe they asked a completely reasonable question that someone that did not have the credentials they claimed to haves unable to answer.", "If college level science taught me anything, it's that things are VERY simplified for compulsory education so the answer OP thinks he knows is probably a very small piece of it.", "Exactly. And, this little quiz of her knowledge may have been completely off-topic and used to discredit her. If she wasn't talking about those systems, the talk could have been sidetracked into a several-minute discussion on those systems instead of the real topic. YTA. You wanted to embarrass and humiliate her so you could be the smartest person in the room. The only thing you proved was that you are a gigantic ass and smug know-it-all trying to show off.", "This! Thank you. The only way it's not fake is if the psychologist could answer the question, but chose not to.  . Or the OP didn't think her answer was good enough and kept trying to debate her", "There are legal definitions of what it means to claim to be a therapis-t but anyone can claim to be a psychologist.  I assume the school would actually want credentials for such a presenter. But then I know MOST of the school programs that are out there are 100% snake oil, put together by essentially unqualified idiots (the number of times I have helped my teacher friends learn what some moron taught them in some inservice that was just full on wrong...I can't even count- and I have a PhD in Neuroscience, and am published in my field of specific study, you can freaking check my credentials.  But most schools pay for these things without any assessment if they are being offered by qualified credentialed persons- or just a snake oil salesman on the internet. Would not surprise me if this presenter had no credentials beyond taking Psych 100 class at some point.  \n\nThen again, this is taught in Psych 100 level classes- so maybe they just read a random pop-psych book, and decided to see if they could make some money.", "Psychologist here. Nah, it comes up a lot, especially in psychoeducation for anxiety disorders (especially panic disorder) and PTSD. My guess is the presenter wasn\u2019t thrown off by the content of the question but by the fact that (per a comment by OP) it was in a long string of other questions that disrupted the flow of the presentation.", "I\u2019m a psychologist (most of us are PhDs, PsyD is slightly different but still falls under the umbrella) and the answer to this question is super duper easy for anyone who works with panic disorder because it\u2019s panic disorder psycho-Ed 101.\n\nMy guess is this wasn\u2019t about this question but about the fact that, as OP admitted, it was the last in a long string of questions that may not be difficult but that the person didn\u2019t have a ton of built in time to answer and disrupted the flow and effectiveness of their presentation.", "i just student taught in middle school band earlier this year, the kids would try that but they werent very good at it yet\ud83d\ude05 they\u2019d ask me stuff like \u201cwhats you\u2019re favorite dinosaur?\u201d very easy to pick out and breeze past. id try to incorporate it, like i was trying to get them to play at measure 36 when they asked the dino question so i said \u201cthe one that they discovered 36th. lets go!\u201d and made them play", "Maybe in a college class. THis sounds like that kid who asks about something that was already covered in depth earlier in the lecture, or who doesnt recognize that there's going to be a Q&A at the end of the lecture not during", "I've been in a similar situation as that presenter. I've definitely been stumped by a question that I thought was so basic that it couldn't actually be what the person was asking.", "The thing is even if someone is an expert on a topic, they are not going to know every single detail they ever learned. And what was said previously, deciding the level of detail to get into also happens often.", "Did you even bother to read the post? The topic was \"how the nervous system works.\" You don't need to dive into the specifics. The presenter could have just said that the sympathetic nervous system is the gas and the parasympathetic nervous system is the break.", "\"I can explain in detail the function of the brain and spinal cord but I have no idea what the difference is between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system is\" said no psychologist ever.", "It's not about knowing the difference but the level of detail to give to that particular audience.", "Also psychology is not neuroscience", "I get it. You are upset that you don't understand the difference between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. That shouldn't upset you unless you are psychologist doing a presentation on how the nervous system works. Because that is an easy question for a college freshman.", "Sympathetic vs parasympathetic is not hard science. They fact that you don't understand that doesn't mean that it is hard. It just means that it is above your head. But that concept is the equivalent of \"the sky is blue\" for any psychologist doing a presentation on how the nervous system works.", "NTA just me these people are hyper sensitive. You\u2019re paying for education", "I\u2019m a therapist - I have a degree in psychology then furthered my education and have a masters degree and I\u2019m board certified in the state of AR. I honesty would have been thrown off as well, if I were coming to talk about techniques to stay calm during test taking time. Your question had nothing to do with what was going on besides knowing big words. A simple google search will answer your question. I would encourage you to reread your post and ask yourself if you are the A hole or not. Especially read this paragraph you wrote: \u201c Needless to say, I was furious. So a person comes to a bunch of 17-year-olds to deliver a lecture on something and they aren't ready to answer a single question about what they have been talking about five minutes before? Besides, no one else was giving two craps about the presentation, I was the only one who cared enough to ask questions. Had I not interrogated the psychologist she would have had a hard time regardless, as it would be noticeable that no one was caring.\u201d", "YTA. They were there to give tips about staying calm during exam season, not as a general 'I'm a psychologist, AMA' lecture. They probably seemed thrown off track because your question was completely irrelevant to the presentation they'd been asked to give, they didn't want to be rude to you by pointing this out, but also wanted to stay on track and deliver the information that was actually relevant to this lecture", "NTA, if you're a psychologist and cant explain the difference between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems then you have no standing to call yourself a medical professional.\n\nThe whole point of presenting to HS students is for them to learn something and potentially ask questions, if you cant answer those questions (from 17yo's who are almost guaranteed to know little to nothing about said topic) then you're incompetent in your field.", "You're the asshole", "YTA\n\nIts common etiquette that most of the time(unless specified otherwise by the lecturer themself) that the questions come at THE END of the lecture, if the questions are so important you\u2019ll remember them by the end of the lecture, if not they were already answered/ irrelevant, you could\u2019ve also wrote them down if you feared forgetting. \n\nAlso considering the topic, you said it was in order to calm down during exam season\u2026\n\nYour question was kinda irrelevant considering the focus/point of the presentation.", "NTA\n\nYour teacher is reacting to the presenters embarrassment. Not your problem. Tell her next time she can say \u2018save your questions\u2019 like every teacher who wants kids to stfu\n\nIf you were being condescending cause the lady couldn\u2019t answer that\u2019s a different issue. You\u2019re not clear in your post.\n\nA psychologist is not an MD/biologist, they wouldn\u2019t know beyond the scope of their area in many cases. Psychiatrists go to med school and would know more about physiology. \n\nDon\u2019t be a critic for the sake of it, google dunning Kruger event, you don\u2019t yet know much so you likely are falling into your own trap if you\u2019re patronising experts\u2026when you don\u2019t know much yourself.\n\nLastly, respect is not about who is right. If the adults are saying you were not respectful, listen and learn.", "It's not an irrelevant question when the topic is the nervous system. In fact, it's a very basic question. If she is talking about the nervous system and can't answer it, she shouldn't be lecturing the kids. The biology teacher probably knew this and was trying to save face.", "Check OPs comment history", "OMG. Flashbacks to rad tech school!!!\ud83d\ude02There was this one girl who LOVED to do this, like she was asking this brilliant question, when all she did was look like a dumbass!  I had to mentally force myself to NOT  knock my head repeatedly on the desk once she started talking \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.", "It is quite literally high school level psychology in my country. In some states, year 10 (if they run an elective course). \n\nIt's like asking a practising statistician the difference between a bar graph and histogram and them not knowing.", "She was explaining how to keep calm during exams & mentioned the sympathetic & parasympathetic nervous systems without describing what those terms mean and how they relate to the topic?", "\"If everywhere you go you smell shit, check your own shoe.\"", "Yah, this gets at least a cursory mention in just about every psych class, ever. From 101, up through the 300 and 400 levels where you get to review it even though you've heard it a thousand times.\n\nPsych 101? Covers it. Psychology of Stress? In excruciating detail. Sport Psych? You bet. Psychology of Development? You get a whole week coving how childhood trauma fucks it up. Abnormal Psychology? At least once per chapter. I'm pretty sure even my Cultural Psychology and and Forensic Psychology courses brought it up a couple times.\n\nIf this was an actual psychologist, she knew the fucking answer.", "It can be a but confusing to understand which system is responsible for what. So i understand if op was atturaly unsure (don't believe it tho? \n\nHowever didn't op say it was exam prep.\n\nThe presenter wouldn't need answer questions about the content only the method to answer the questions.\n\nYou're right, the biospsychology aspect would be lightly odd.", "Would that answer be enough to answer any questions the exam bored offers?\n\nThough it is close enough because you're right it's not overly complicated. Tho a bit confusing i guess at first", "People who work with kids also use laughter to avoid bullying children who are making us want to throw them through a wall :) You laugh so you don't scream", "Look at OPs comment history. Armchair psychologist trying to bully a credentialed professional", "With all due respect, when in a class where learning a topic is the goal, you have to learn by whatever means necessary to do your best in the class.  For some people that means reading, for some that means being an active participant. \nI always preface my classes by letting my teachers know I\u2019m neurodivergent and that I ask a lot of questions and I\u2019ve only ever had positive responses.  I\u2019ve also talked to fellow classmates and apologies for asking a lot of questions and quite often, their response is \u201cI actually appreciate it because I was thinking the same thing but didn\u2019t want to ask\u201d\n\nI never implied everything was about me but it seems like everyone else seems to think so for shaming someone that just seems like he wants to learn what the professor/instructor is offering \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNot everyone learns the same way and some of us have to make an outspoken effort for a fighting chance at being successful", "Also they are not completely correct. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in our body is not just for stress and long term stress (even more than a few days) starts to involve more complex systems. All this to say if I was giving a lecture I would also be careful because it is so complicated.", "Maybe I read the post incorrectly, but I understood this to be more of 'please keep calm during exams, here are tips from a psychologist' lecture rather than a more involved nervous system lecture. I had a few of these in high school when teachers realized everyone was close to melting down, they'd bring a lecturer in under a vague academic pretext with the main goal of giving perspective or coping tips.", "Ugh. I don't like most armchair psychology. Just suggest a lack of understanding.\n\nAlthough sometimes it is helpful to suggest - - - to soemone.", "Of course you\u2019re father is on your side.

This sounds like what is happening here.", "YTA. There are people smarter than you in every room, although you don't understand that. Bring a showoff is not a good look either.", "Soft YTA \n\nThe psychologist should have told you that there will be time for questions at the end of the presentation instead of engaging you in the midst of a presentation. Presentations have a flow if you have practiced giving them. If you interrupt someone mid-presentation, it can take a minute for them to get back to their last train of thought. At your age, you are almost certainly away the difference between a presentation and a regular school lesson where you can ask questions in the middle of everything, which is why the soft YTA \n\nIf the focus of presentation was stress management techniques with only a few minutes at the beginning for background about the nervous system, it\u2019s a little more asshole-ish because the question is a little in the weeds. It wasn\u2019t the focus of the talk, and you had to be aware of that. \n\nIf the focus of the talk was mostly describing the nervous system, I think the question is fair game, assuming the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems were topics specifically  discussed. \n\nIf you brought this very specific topic up out of the blue with no direct mention of that topic in the presentation, you are an asshole. If you already know the words parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems and they weren\u2019t mentioned in the presentation, it becomes obvious you are showboating.

I don\u2019t know enough.  Did the speaker ask you to hold questions to the end of the presentation? Did you keep asking the same question ?  I\u2019d say she probably wasn\u2019t a seasoned presenter and probably was embarrassed she couldn\u2019t answer the question.\n\nHey they say there are no dumb questions!", "I mean it's a stupid question when  unrelated to the subject at hand. The psychology isn't the study of the nervous system, and I wouldn't expect your average psychologist to be able to answer the question in much depth. If the speaker were a neurologist that would have been a fair question. OP thinks he showed this person up with his brilliant questioning and the post is a humblebrag, except his \"I was just asking questions\" were questions off topic. He didn't get told off for asking a question the speaker couldn't answer, he got told off for disrupting and asking questions in bad faith.", "That's my guess. It's happened to me when I've lectured and your brain shuts down a little when you've been talking and you think they're listening and then you get this shit.", "Well, that was a horrible rabbit hole of smug and I now want to have the mind eraser-device from MIB", "Right, so you had a psychologist come in to talk about handling stress through psychological techniques and you thought you'd grill them to show off to the room your knowledge and disrupt the talk - because we all know you weren't just asking that question or all the others in good faith. The \"I was just asking a question\" guy isn't novel and is an AH.\n\nIronically, you showed off not only are you an AH you don't know shit about psychology. The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are neurology/physiology, a psychologist wouldn't be working on those systems so why would they know about them? Did you also ask about the resting heart rate of quokkas, and the nitrogen composition of Venus, because both questions are about as relevant to a talk from a psychologist on exam stress as your question was.", "Just because you're ND does not give you the right to disturb other peoples learning or enjoyment of lectures constantly. A much better skill for you would have been to learn to write questions down and ask them in the end. And no, people are not always more than happy/pleased to answer your questions. They are usually polite and since you let them know beforehand of your disability they don't want to risk you kicking up a fuss when they tell you to wait until the end. \nAnd just the cheek to assume that the person refusing to answer pointless questions from the guy who asked several before must be because they don't know their subject or are a bad speaker..."]}
