If its in a presentation, dont be that guy who asks irrelevant questions, or questions that obviously will be dealt with later on. Wait untill the presentation is done untill asking. \n\nAlso, \"Had i not interrogated the psychologist\" dude what? So you didnt just ask a simple question from the sound of it.", "INFO: Was that the only question you asked, or did you continue asking after the presenter was affected?", ">I, being a very curious guy asked the psychologist what the difference was between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. \n\nYTA, this isn't the time for this question, you attempted to derail the presentation which had limited time.\n\nDid you know the answer already and attempt to gotcha her? Any 17 year old I've known that would ask the question absolutely would know the answer already.", "YTA\n\n>This very question left the psychologist very uneasy, she could not give a clear answer and was left uncomfortable for the rest of the presentation\n\nProbably because you interrupted her mid-presentation with a question that could EASILY have been left until the end.\n\n>Had I not interrogated the psychologist\n\nCalm down there, 5-0.   It was a presentation, not an interrogation.", "YTA - don't disrupt someone multiple times in a presentation! That's just rude and of course would make the presentator uncomfortable (not everybody is a well-versed speaker and being bothered with questions in their speech might make them lose the \"flow\".) \n\nYou could have waited until the end of the presentation. That's the normal thing to do and there is normally a time set aside for questions. You can't tell me you didn't notice how disruptive you were? Or was that the goal?", "While that  is a basic question a psychologist should know, it sounds like you interrupted her presentation. Also \"interrogated\" her? tf dude? It's one thing to ask a question or two but another to blow her up. I'm gonna say YTA", "INFO: did the presenter reference or discuss the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems before your question?\n\nIt sounds like you intentionally asked questions that were outside the scope of the presentation, and possibly the educational background of the presenter. It sounds like you were intentionally being a dick, for what reason I don\u2019t know.\n\nThe sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are more about anatomy and physiology, and are probably more appropriate questions for a biology or medical lecture. An expert in psychology, especially a PhD psychologist, would probably know these things, but someone there to talk about staying calm during exams might not be also educated and prepared to discuss concepts that are outside of their lecture.", "YTA. You were being confrontational and asking a question that wasn\u2019t related to the subject matter. The psychologist was probably there on their own free time to help those who fight nerves. A psychologist is not a medical doctor. You asked medical questions that have nothing to do with the presentation. You sound like someone who thinks they always need to be right and that\u2019s a problem.", "INFO: was the question relevant/in theme with the presentation?", "seeing as you didn't wait til the end and interrupted the presentation soft YTA but the teachers should have made it clear at the start not to interrupt the presentation and wait til the end.", "Your wouldn't be in the wrong if you asked your question during question time, but I kinda doubt you waited so I'm going with YTA.", "YTA. Guest presenter, you should be on guest manners. Asking multiple questions during a presentation is typically a no-no and disrespectful to the class and the presenter. Next time, listen to the presentation and hold your questions until the end.", "You're not TAH for asking a question.\n\nYTA for making much ado about nothing.", "NTA, assuming you were polite and actually just asked a question. I'm a psychologist and have given group therapy and lectures and all that. \nIf you're giving a lecture you either control the crowd and if they keep interrupting where you wanna go, direct them to wait with questions until the end. Or you answer them shortly. I've given stress lectures. This is an incredibly basic question. She might have been nervous, but that's not really your problem.", "YTA for interrupting her presentation, yeah. I do think that's a softball question she should have been able to answer, but you're acting like she must not know the answer when very often people who don't do public speaking for a living get uncomfortable and awkward when they are rudely interrupted. \n\nYour teacher is correct that it is not appropriate to ask questions in the middle of a presentation, you always save them for the end.", "NTA. It was natural to assume someone brought in as an expert to an educational institution should be able to field a few questions. If your intention was to embarrass her, then YWBTA, but that's a pretty basic question for a psychologist. It sounds as if she was trained by her company to give a presentation on how to take exams, so she's likely a trainer, not a psychologist, and that's where the division of opinion comes in - you expected psychological expertise and others expected trainer.", "NTA\n\nIf the psychologist is talking about the nervous system, it's perfectly reasonable to ask the difference between those two types.    And, bluntly, that psychologist should know the layman's difference at least.  To be prepared for an obvious question.  \n\nFrankly, that shows poor preparation on her part.  \n\nIt seems many other people have \"blind obedience to authority\" as more important than \"knowing the material you're lecturing about.\"  Which I think is backwards.  Experts gain their authority because of their knowledge.", "You are obviously NTA- you asked a perfectly reasonable question but the fact is this person (I hesitate to use the term psychologist because if she actually were one she should know the answer to your query) doesn\u2019t actually know what she\u2019s talking about and is probably friends with your teacher. Ignore your teacher but don\u2019t bother confronting her - it probably won\u2019t get you anything. But do ignore her a KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS!\n\nNTA", "Depends! If you interrupted her in between her presentation with a question which could've been asked a bit later then YTA. But, if you asked your doubt on time then you're NTA. Everyone has the right to ask doubts when such seminars/workshops are happening", "NTA - You are in school, you are there to learn and so ask questions.  If the person is presenting something they can't answer questions related to it, then they really set themselves up.  (You are only supposed to ask soft-ball questions?)\n\nI would love to hear the reasons why people are \"against\" what you did.", "Based on the information (only have one side) NTA.\n\nHowever, the presenter not knowing the answer on the spot doesn\u2019t always mean incompetence or unpreparedness. (It can, but not always) Sometimes you can prepare completely (even prepare to answer questions) but totally go blank when asked in a presentation. Source: Many years of presenting and it still happens to me\u2026.talking one on one is fine but in front of a small group there is a good chance I go blank even if it\u2019s something I know very well.", "Haha! NTA! \n\nIf someone presents themselves as an expert, then they better know their stuff. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, you asked a related question because you were interested in the subject. \n\nYou weren\u2019t being vexatious and you didn\u2019t intend to make the person uncomfortable. The teachers should be cross that they got someone in who didn\u2019t know their own subject well enough to be questioned by undergraduate students.", "NTA \n\nbut i mean. there are no stupid questions. but what does sns and pns have anything to do with psychology?", "Did you interrogate her or ask her a question? Did you interrupt her or raise your hand then called on? \nTentative NTA until my questions are answered because she absolutely should have been able to answer that without problem. Her insecurity is not your fault nor problem.\nAlso sympathetic nervous system is fight or fight. It's quick emergency survival.\nParasympathetic is \"rest digest\" and \"feed and breed.\" It's the every day needs for survival.", "NTA unless you were specifically instructed to leave questions for the end (or for designated question breaks during the presentation). It sounds like the person was not a strong presentor and wasn't comfortable in the setting, but that's not your fault. If anything, the experience was a low stakes way for her to practice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But from reading your other comments I'm going to make an assumption that what you were actually doing was \"interrogating\" (your word) the psychologist, not actually to learn (as you could, and probably should, have very reasonably waited until the end of the presentation) but to show your class, and the visiting speaker, how very clever you are. When they got fed up of you flexing your teenage know-all-I'm-so-smart attitude and shut down your game you then decided that you showed up the psychologists' ignorance of the material as a way to prove to yourself that you're absolutely the cleverest baba in the class (and far more smart than the actual expert who wouldn't play your game).", "INFO: Often with presentations, questions are meant to be held until the end. Was that the case here?", "You're the ah if you were asking questions during instead of after. All presentations have time for questions when it's done. I suggest you write down your questions as they come up so you can ask them and not forget them while you wait. You're not the ah for asking a question they couldn't answer. They should have been more prepared. They probably weren't expecting anyone to care enough to ask questions, let alone one they couldn't answer. ESH. Your teacher sucks by the way.", "INFO:  Was this a lecture or was it a discussion?

Bro. What psychologist doesn't know the difference between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system? Not only is it a basic but they were literally presenting the nervous system so I don't get why that question would be out of their expertise.", "NTA. It\u2019s her fault, not yours, that she couldn\u2019t give you a clear answer right away. That type of clarification question is basic and the answer could be necessary to understand if the rest of the presentation is related to it or builds on it. It would be better for your learning if you don\u2019t wait until the end to ask in this case. Great job being the one person who participated!", "NTA. A lot of idiots in here saying your question wasn\u2019t relevant. But if it\u2019s at someone talking about trying to stay calm then you t would make sense to talk about the SNS and PNS which act antagonistic to each other on events of stress. Sounds like you asked a good a reasonable question, and providing you raised your hand like you said you did then you have done nothing out of the ordinary from a usual university lecture.", "That is very basic information. A college freshman should be able to answer that question. You can't explain the stress response without knowing the difference between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
