She passed unexpectedly last year, leaving me, and my two siblings. She never got to complete the word \u201clove\u201d.\n\nWhen I was younger I asked her \u201cWhat happens if you get too old and can\u2019t have a baby anymore?\u201d or something along those lines, and she told me that one of us could have a baby and finish it for her. She said it \u201cwouldn't be the same, but the tribute would make me happy.\u201d\n\nMy parents had marital problems up till her death because of my fathers infidelity and I think she put off having the 4th child for quite some time because of it - however she always said baby Elise or Emilio would be completing our family soon.\n\nI was around 6-7 months pregnant when my father and his wife (and former mistress) announced their pregnancy. She chimed in saying she would finally bring little Emilio into our family. My sister and I were horrified, and spoke to my dad privately that, while mom did want someone to continue on the acronym idea, we found it disrespectful to do it with the woman he was cheating on her with.\n\nI then told him about how she said she wanted one of us to carry on the name when I was a child. He shut me down saying that she \u201cprobably expected her and I to still be together\u201d and that \u201cIt\u2019ll be better with all of you guys in the same generation of the family.\u201d - and left it at that. My brother agreed.\n\nTwo weeks before I gave birth, they found out they were not having a boy as they hoped, but a girl. I realized I could take the name Elise before they would have a chance to name their baby my mothers chosen name. They could name her \u201cEmily\u201d or something else, but it wouldn\u2019t be the name my mother chose and that's what mattered to me. So I did.\n\nMy father, and especially my step mother are furious at me for \u201cruining\u201d my mothers lasting wishes and tarnishing her idea.
