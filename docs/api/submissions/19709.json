She passed unexpectedly last year, leaving me, and my two siblings. She never got to complete the word \u201clove\u201d.\n\nWhen I was younger I asked her \u201cWhat happens if you get too old and can\u2019t have a baby anymore?\u201d or something along those lines, and she told me that one of us could have a baby and finish it for her. She said it \u201cwouldn't be the same, but the tribute would make me happy.\u201d\n\nMy parents had marital problems up till her death because of my fathers infidelity and I think she put off having the 4th child for quite some time because of it - however she always said baby Elise or Emilio would be completing our family soon.\n\nI was around 6-7 months pregnant when my father and his wife (and former mistress) announced their pregnancy. She chimed in saying she would finally bring little Emilio into our family. My sister and I were horrified, and spoke to my dad privately that, while mom did want someone to continue on the acronym idea, we found it disrespectful to do it with the woman he was cheating on her with.\n\nI then told him about how she said she wanted one of us to carry on the name when I was a child.

My brother agreed.\n\nTwo weeks before I gave birth, they found out they were not having a boy as they hoped, but a girl. I realized I could take the name Elise before they would have a chance to name their baby my mothers chosen name. They could name her \u201cEmily\u201d or something else, but it wouldn\u2019t be the name my mother chose and that's what mattered to me.

That you hate she couldn\u2019t continue the naming tradition but you are so honored you where able to not only use one of the two names(yes add the boys name in their) she had chosen if she could have had one more child.\n\n\nBut yes I would 100 percent be that petty!", "This disrespect to the OP\u2019s mom by this other woman is INCREDIBLE. This is some next level disrespect here", "Yeah, saying she is in the same generation as this half sibling is technically correct in terms of the family, I guess. But come on, she is never going to have a sibling bond with a child who is the same age as her own baby. It will be way more of an aunt - niece dynamic. That sibling ship has sailed. \n\nThe nerve of the stepmom and dad, its so disrespectful to her mother's memory.", "Yeah, this. The fathers new baby isn\u2019t in any way related to OP\u2019s mom. Stealing her name scheme from her is weird as F.\n\nI am certain she would have been over the moon to donate her chosen name to her new beloved grandchild, though. That grandma juice is powerful stuff.", "The mistress and dad seem desperate to control the narrative (as shitty people often do in similar situations). It\u2019s been my experience that whoever speaks out first \u201cwins.\u201d There\u2019s no way that dad and the mistress have the moral high ground on this matter. I mean try to explain \u201cI cheated on my dying wife and couldn\u2019t even be original, so I disrespected my dead wives tradition with my mistress\u201d.  It\u2019s just not going to fly if OP blasts them on social media first. OP shouldn\u2019t feel bad for a second and quite frankly I wouldn\u2019t blame her for airing their nonsense on social media.", "Her dad is selfish narcissists that wants to take one more thing away from her mom! The only thing they have left a name!", "Mistress is trying to rub it in the family's face that she has replaced their mom.  I'd just have nothing to do with her at all.", "No. I was spelling something far ruder in reference to SM being a home wrecker.", "And ask her what she's going to do when he cheats on her, and all she is left with is a child that his late wife named? I don't get why she would even want to use the  name in the first place.", "There's burns and then there's murder, this is closer to the latter", "So do I. Can we be friends?", "Don\u2019t post her face. Post her little feet cupped in yours hands. I can see why you don\u2019t want her face shown. Or post a pic of you holding her that just shows her head. You get bonus points if you have something of your moms in the background such as a picture. But yes post the conversation.\n\n\n\nEdit to add: op when you do this please update!", "How about a picture of your mom and the three of you? Or just a pic of your mom? Let people say what they will-they\u2019re assholes.", "They have the E already, so they only need to work backwards through Roger, Oscar, Holly, and Walter to honor the stepmom appropriately", "Agreed. My grandmother and my great grandmother were pregnant at the same time. Great-grandma started having kids young and ended in her mid forties with a surprise baby when her daughter was having her first. \n\nI don't even understand how someone can be as shameless as these people are being. He might as well photoshop the new wife's face onto the old photos, he seems to want to just replace her.", "That also occurred in my family a generation prior to me, BEFORE there was reliable birth control.  \n\nThere is no reason for it to be still happening.  \n\nWhen it happens now it\u2019s either families with ill advised religious beliefs being pressured to overpopulate in the name of their deity of choice or parents who didn\u2019t do a great job raising their oldest continuing to have more kids.  Even if you had your oldest very young, for what it takes for a young adult to be established today, to have adequate education and financial stability to really be ready to be a parent, that\u2019s unlikely to be achieved while their parents are still in their childbearing years.  Continuing the less than desirable cycle they were born in to sure, but breaking it and creating a better life for their own family, unlikely.\n\nThe fact that you can relate to him on this doesn\u2019t mean what you think it does for yourself.", "> *I thought they were starting over with a four letter word.* \n\nI had the same thought!  I was so confused.", "This. The only reason I can think of is that she's trying to take the first wife's place in the way to hurt the three older siblings the most.", "Nathan Natalie Nick Ned and Newt", "No,flambe is delicious, this is just burnt rubber (pun intended). lmao", "Newt is my favourite, he\u2019s the one that needs the most cuddles.", "I love Newt too!", "NTA\n\nYour siblings need to have your back especially over this. The fact that the mistress wants to continue a family tradition with a family she became apart of by being a side piece is crazy. I would tell her all her feelings are invalid and thats I truly didn\u2019t care. Not only did your mother pass away and you\u2019re trying to honor her, but this was HER idea regardless.", "NTA. \n\nLook. There are only two AH  in this story and that's your father and his fucking mistress.  The vileness of their actions, not only the infidelity, but taking your mother's idea and continuing with it? It's fucking despicable.\n\nThere's no way in hell, I'd ever be okay with my father acting like that and I'd have him cut out of my life real fast and in a hurry. It sounds like your mother never got the chance to control the narrative with everyone else, so your father and his mistress wife did. \n\nI'd do as the other commentor said and go petty as fuck. They're already calling you an asshole. Give them a **real** reason to do it. Call both of them out and explain why you did it. If anyone in your family has any empathy, then they're going to understand and no longer side with your father.\n\nFuck. My stomach hurts just thinking about the way they're **STILL** betraying your mother. Them naming their fucking kid after her tradition would be the last thing she wants.\n\nI'm sorry, but your dad and step mother mistress **ARE NOT** good people. They're vile and immoral and the way he's acted/acting, he is **NOT** someone I would **EVER** look at with respect again.\n\n**DO NOT APOLOGIZE.** \n\nYou're carrying on your mother's tradition in the way ***SHE*** wanted it to be done. They **DO NOT** get to take that from her too and I'd sure in the hell tell them that.", "Yes, I was thinking that too. It's incredibly callous and self-absorbed. Do you think maybe the father has a personality disorder?", "I was about to post this very thing!  OP had righteous truth on her side.  They're putting it out there and are being nasty in the process.  If OP wants to end this once and for all, this is the way to do it. Go scorched earth! Put them ALL on blast.  The mistress, the father, and every single person that dares to speak up on their behalf.  \n\nOP, you're not the AH and so far you're a far nicer person than I am.  There wouldn't be a person left in my town that wouldn't know what SHE and MY FATHER did to my mother.", "If I was your mom, nothing would make me happier than knowing, while your dad \"moved on\" by marrying this other person, all he was thinking about while planning the wedding was your mom lol.", "[Hank Scorpio](https://media2.giphy.com/media/11l39366q3bvmo/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47467azw0afl5836r8itwmlqsyexb529t6mowa9zwf&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) is who you're thinking of :)", "Most excellent!", "I feel like that would be a waste of dicks. Why would give a bag of dicks to such animals?", "Maybe he just hates his dead wife and wants to dishonor her memory with one last fuck you.", "May I ask, what did Hailey Bieber do?", "it's more surprising that the brother is on his side than anything", "Just post your moms tradition then.   You don\u2019t have to post a pic", "But the OP cannot grow up with the child (they are already an adult) so they can\u2019t have a sibling bond in the regular sense of having memories of growing up together. Their age gap means they will never be peers. They will possibly have grandchildren when that sibling gives them niblings."]}
