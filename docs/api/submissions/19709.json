She dedicated her life to her art, she was a painter and rather eccentric. She had the idea of having 4 children, and naming us in order to spell out \u201cL-O-V-E\u201d with our first initials. She passed unexpectedly last year, leaving me, and my two siblings. She never got to complete the word \u201clove\u201d.\n\nWhen I was younger I asked her \u201cWhat happens if you get too old and can\u2019t have a baby anymore?\u201d or something along those lines, and she told me that one of us could have a baby and finish it for her. She said it \u201cwouldn't be the same, but the tribute would make me happy.\u201d\n\nMy parents had marital problems up till her death because of my fathers infidelity and I think she put off having the 4th child for quite some time because of it - however she always said baby Elise or Emilio would be completing our family soon.\n\nI was around 6-7 months pregnant when my father and his wife (and former mistress) announced their pregnancy. She chimed in saying she would finally bring little Emilio into our family. My sister and I were horrified, and spoke to my dad privately that, while mom did want someone to continue on the acronym idea, we found it disrespectful to do it with the woman he was cheating on her with.\n\nI then told him about how she said she wanted one of us to carry on the name when I was a child. He shut me down saying that she \u201cprobably expected her and I to still be together\u201d and that \u201cIt\u2019ll be better with all of you guys in the same generation of the family.\u201d - and left it at that. My brother agreed.\n\nTwo weeks before I gave birth, they found out they were not having a boy as they hoped, but a girl. I realized I could take the name Elise before they would have a chance to name their baby my mothers chosen name. They could name her \u201cEmily\u201d or something else, but it wouldn\u2019t be the name my mother chose and that's what mattered to me. So I did.\n\nMy father, and especially my step mother are furious at me for \u201cruining\u201d my mothers lasting wishes and tarnishing her idea. While my sister agrees with me, she won't say it to my dad since the birth. My aunt and other family on my dads side called me names from \u201cpetty\u201d and \u201ctroublemaking\u201d to just outright a bitch. I did not expect so much backlash and it's really stressing me out with just giving birth - and they\u2019re taunting me by posting pictures of their ultrasounds with captions like \u201cThe E baby is coming 2024\u201d and \u201cThree's a crowd but Four is Love\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s driving me crazy and it feels like this rift in the family is all for nothing since they\u2019re going to claim their baby is the \u201creal e baby\u201d anyways.  \n\n\nI forgot to add this in, but My step mom actually approached me and asked me for permission, and politely asked me to change my mind on the baby name once she caught wind that I was already planning on naming the baby Elise. This is part of why I think I can be TA. I never actually officially announced the name first, I felt like it would be more special naming the baby when they arrive, not before.", "created_utc": 1686794605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149pthl/aita_for_stealing_a_baby_name_from_my_step_mother/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Absolutely not TA. Your dad and step mom are hypocrites. They're the ones tarnishing her idea and disrespecting her memory.

It was your mom\u2019s idea to pass it along to the kids anyway.\n\nThe fact that your dad can just gloss over everything that he did and think the new wife can complete LOVE is just ridiculous. Plus the fact his family has just taunted you makes this so much worse.\n\nHave you considered cutting them out completely?\n\nThe one thing to remember, if nothing else, try to be nice to the new baby. The baby is going to grow up thinking they have this connection with you because of LOVE.

You all own it, not your dad w/mistress.\n\nCelebrate L-O-V-E the way it was meant to be, and be proud, and just simply respond to the haters as a loving siblings with thier newest nephew, and everyone can express they know mom would be proud.\n\nNice job", "NTA, one could argue that you had planned to name your child that before your father and his mistress. Because technically you were pregnant first and would give birth first. And its not like you heard them considering the name and decided it was a good one, you had chosen this name before you ever became pregnant. I also don't appreciate infidelity and find it highly audacious of the mistress to feel entitled to so much of your mother's.", "NTA. Cut everyone on social media who has said something negative about you, directly or indirectly. They\u2019re not true family.

Have pictures done of you, your siblings, and Elise with LOVE on it. At the end of the day your kid you get to pick the name.", "NTA.\n\nThey are being ridiculous. You can't steal a name. There's actually nothing to stop them still using the name Elise if they want. My extended family has more than person with the same given name. No one is bothered by the fact that are first cousins, or uncle and nephew, or whatever. No one has a monopoly on names.\n\nThe only time I would ever say \"I wouldn't do this if I were you\" would be if you named the baby after someone who died, especially a baby or young person who died. You wouldn't want them to be constantly reminded of their own painful loss every time they spoke to your child, or every time you referred to your child. But that isn't the case here.
