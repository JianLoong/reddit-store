BIL is a gigantic AH!", "Nta, bil is taking advantage  of youAND being ableist prick.", "I don't know if someone else suggested this already, but a slap chop is great for one handed chopping. You can chop things small as well. You deserve better btw. Good luck.", "NTA. I assume your \u201cgf\u201d is aware of any issues you might have performing certain tasks, so she should understand. So I don\u2019t know what her issue is with you standing up to a bully. BIL lacks courtesy as a houseguest and lashed out because you called him on his BS. Perhaps they need to grow up since they went running back to their family. You\u2019ve learned to adapt to your situation and make the best of what you can, good for you, it\u2019s obviously more than those 2 can claim.\n\nAlso, side note and it\u2019s probably years outdated and under a new name. Could you use a slap-chop type kitchen instrument? I got one for my mom years ago, throw the veggies on a cutting board and hold the tool over it and just hit the handle. A blade comes down and slices the veggies as much as you want while all being contained by the plastic around it. I think a tool like this could help you if you need veggies and have run out.\n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA! The (hopefully EX) girlfriend and BIL are. Literally what", "NTA. Bless your mom! Your gf sounded like she\u2019s using you. She\u2019s not helping you with anything small..", "NTA, but stop texting. GF knows why your mother cuts up veggies for you. Her brother was verbally abusive to you. She didn't defend you or explain that you physically can't chop veggies and that she doesn't want to cut them up or cook. If she can't be bothered to defend you to her family, you really don't need her in your life.\n\nYou deserve better.\n\nETA: Block them all.", "NTA.  Normally, I shy away from rude gestures, but in this situation, I would not be upset if you texted a pic of you flipping the bird....", "NTA.\n\nIt's rad your mom does this for you.\n\nIt's rad you don't let your arm keep you from cooking!\n\nDon't let your lazy GF or her deadbeat brother back in the house.\nText back any of their family who has decided to take a stance on you and your vegetables back with a reminder that they're welcome to take both of them in, and that his ex was right.", "But by their own logic, the GF should have been the one chopping the vegetables.  Your mom was helping because your GF was lazy.  \n\nNTA", "You would do best ending that relationship as you would have that family in your life for the rest of yours", "The only strings that need to be cut are the ones with that family. Run.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Even though I know how to cook, my husband does most of the cooking. I happily cut and peel his vegetables, even the ones I don't like. Block all of them!! You will find someone who is happy to cut your vegetables too!! Let your mom keep helping you for now. Your (ex?) gf didn't deserve you.", "NTA, your gf didn't back you up so she's not the one for you.  She doesn't respect you or she would have been equally pissed at her brother.  Add to that how they go running to their family to harass you with is immature to the max!", "She's lazy too - he does all the cooking and she can't even dice vegetables for him? And now she's letting other people disrespect him for not dicing vegetables even though she, a presumably able bodied person with all her fingers, can't do it either? It's bewildering. How can someone have so little shame?", "Top comment.", "I just want to say I love it when people help people like this. Take my poor person\u2019s award \ud83e\udd47 \n\nAlso NTA. You physically can\u2019t do it", "Agree. OP you're NTA at all but all people, able bodied or not, needs one of these awesome kitchen gadgets. It's life changing.", "Does this work easily? I don't have enough strength to push down hard, so looking at this I'm worried I wouldn't be able to get even halfway through the onions. I have an electric one but it dices too finely, so this would be perfect.", "This! my dad has very bad arthritis in his hands and I bought him one for Christmas the year after my Mom passed (10 yrs this month) and he's worn out two since.", "I was thinking of a slap chop even.", "I have hemipaligia and I can't do a fine chop. Does that work well. I'm skeptical cause I've been burned before on those types of products.", "Link didn't work for me, is it correct?", "I was born with some mild hand abnormalities myself which makes certain activities a bit difficult sometimes. I have one of these & love it!", "This is great But you still have to use a knife and cut stuff down to size", "I\u2019ve always wondered if those actually worked. I\u2019ve always been awful at cutting things evenly", "This warms my OT heart! Awesomeness.", "I honestly struggle with mine. It never seems able to actually cut anything. And I broke the metal parts that are made to dive things first try\u2026.", "I agree with you, but like, even if he was more able and his mom did the nice thing of chopping up some veggies for him out of general kindness, that still doesn\u2019t make op a hypocrite, and still leaves the brother a big hypocrite for being lazy. \n\nWho ridicules someone because someone else did a nice thing? NTA.", "The ex-gf's family is ticked because they might have to deal with that particular AH.", "OP just jumped the gun a little bit. I felt the same; should probably not reacted so quickly and told the GF first, but since their family has been sending immature texts about it, sounds like he made the right call regardless of what his GF would have said.", "Even if it was her place too, some things shouldn't need a discussion, the level of disrespect shown towards op and his mom is a non negotiable, brother needed to go.\n\nEdit: NTA", "And, as someone that spent a lot of time with their Mom, cherish the time together. \n\nThankfully my wife and kids loved their MIL/GrandMa, and spent a lot of time with her. But I also was with Mom a lot solo as she got older. I'd not give up one visit for anything. All I have now are the memories. \n\nI'm sure your Mom loves helping you be independent, and you both know you'll survive eating imperfect onions when she's gone.", "Yeah that\u2019s the bit that got me. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to cook, fine! \n\nThen she can prep, shop or clean. \n\nI wonder what she does?", "Right? I am not good with a knife either, but I do all the cooking because I enjoy it. It doesn't have to be chopped perfectly. She could definitely do it for him.", "I\u2019m the cook but when I had an injury my wife did all the chopping and dicing. These days she does it to help me cook especially when I\u2019m making something complicated.", "I don\u2019t either. I just punch it down with my fist.  Gets the job done.", "Half onions are quite hard to get through on a finer dice, but quartered ones go through without too.much difficulty", "Yes! They\u2019re honestly great little devices, despite the internet (and their own commercials) making a mockery of them.", "I saw it, I'm not able to attach a screenshot but try searching for Maipor vegetable chopper!", "You getting a page of html code too? Weird.", "I worked in produce. All that stuff that is packaged by the store like diced onions or cut fruit is usually from the fruits and veggies that are about to or have already started to go bad. A couple peaches with soft spots? Cut the spot off, dice them up, and put them in the fresh cut fruit section. Same with onions.", "Nothing. Same as her mooch brother it seems.", "Also... Like any skills, knife skills improve with practice? No one came out of their mother equipped with the ability to perfectly dice vegetables. She's not even willing to try and learn for him because she's a child.", "A partner who acts like a partner and collaborate with you to make life easier on both of you? Everyone needs to look for this in a relationship.", "Punching it is also a great stress reliever and I love mine.\n\nNTA OP. Your gf may not like cooking but she could at least dice the damn veggies. And the brother is lazy and her making excuses is just the trajectory of what your relationship would be. If my partner physically couldn't finely dice veggies then I would. Thats compromise", "I see, that makes sense. Thanks!", "It's really common that those sorts of products will be designed for people with disabilities, but advertised to other people because those markets are substantially larger. People often take that advertising at face value and call them dumb inventions for problems that don't exist \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I need these in my life. I bulk chop and freeze onions because then I can do it less often, I'd absolutely buy them already cut if that was an option in my local supermarket, I really dislike cutting onions"]}
