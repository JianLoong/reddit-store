If that wasn\u2019t enough, it was in a fixed position with my digit up by my shoulder and the ligament and tendons didn\u2019t really develop so I can\u2019t straighten my arm.\n\nMy parents were great at making sure I would be independent and able to live by myself. Some things I physically can\u2019t do, like tie shoe laces. For the most part I can cut anything by myself, but I struggle with doing fine dices. Every other month or so, my mum will finely cut some veggies for me (usually onion, celery and carrots) so that I can freeze them. I asked her to do this when I lived on my own for the first time because I was fed up of sending onions flying all over my kitchen if I used a knife or it turning to mush if I used the food processor.\n\nWhen my girlfriend (28F) started dating, she told me that she couldn\u2019t cook but also didn\u2019t have an interest in learning to cook. I said this was fine because I like to cook, so when she moved in I became the de facto cook. She has never expressed a problem with my mum cutting vegetables for me, she actually preferred it as she has said she couldn\u2019t cut them finely for me. Her brother (35M) is currently staying with us and has been for the last 4 weeks since his ex threw him out because of how lazy he is. He doesn\u2019t have a job \u2013 I don\u2019t think he has for the 3 years I\u2019ve been with GF \u2013 nor is he looking for one, he also doesn\u2019t help around the house. We were his last resort because no one else would take him in, not even their parents.\n\nMy mum came over yesterday with the freezer bags of diced veggies for me. BIL was annoyed when he saw my mum with the veggies because that morning GF and I had spoken to him about not being so lazy and get a job because he\u2019s an adult and needs to stop relying on people like a child (GF\u2019s words not mine). He was annoyed because he saw me as being a hypocrite because I was getting my mum to cut things for me \u201clike a child\u201d. After my mum left he accused her of mollycoddling me and treating me like I\u2019m incompetent. For me this was a crossed line because this is something I physically can\u2019t do and my mum is just being helpful. I told BIL that I wanted him to leave and that he was no longer welcome in my home - GF moved in with me to my house. GF was upset that I asked her brother to leave as I made a decision without her input and left with him.\n\nSince BIL and GF left, I have texts off him and their family accusing me of being a mummy\u2019s boy, telling me I need to cut the apron strings and cut my own vegetables like an adult. GF hasn\u2019t answered my texts.\n\nAITA for telling my BIL to leave?\n\nEdit: I do use frozen veggies, they are great for a lot of applications, but definitely not for fresh eating. I get some of the harder veggies like butternut squash already cut up and frozen. Though frozen onions I seem to only be able to get sliced. My local supermarket does have prepared veg in the fruit and veg department, but it honestly doesn't look great. The onion in particular is always slimy looking. I do actually need to get a new veg chopper like the slap chop or the box ones that people have suggested. My niece (3) broke my last one trying to help me cook, my sister offered to replace it but I told her it was an accident and she didn't need to do that. I've seen links to a couple that look better than the one I had where I might be able to cut as finely as I want, so I'm gonna order one and give it a try.
