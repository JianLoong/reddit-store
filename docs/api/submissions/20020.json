There was no judgement, he just accepted that it was something that I found almost impossible at that time and helped me. \n\nI'm normally the cook in the house, but for a good month, he cooked most things and when he didn't, he did any cutting I needed done. \n\nImo, this is the right way for a partner to treat an infirmity, whether permanent or temporary.", "Mine came with a stiff brush to clean the cutting screens. I just run it through each direction and then pop it in the dishwasher. My husband is able to do it as well.", "Buy a stiff dish brush. \"Smack\" the underside (non-sharp side) of the screen and it will expel the bits of vegetables and not dull the blade.", "I have severe arthritis and my solution is to just buy frozen pre-diced onions. You can find a lot of vegetables there, and a lot of produce sections will have precut mirepoix, or you can grab stuff from the salad bar.", "Yeah, I'm doubtful even with pairing them down. Might just stick with the food processor one I've got. Thank you for your insight~", "I'll have to tell my food processor to stop dicing my food then", "Even a slap chop crossed my mind.", "I know. Girlfriend sounds like she is just going to keep moving her family in to freeload.", "Agree. OP you're NTA at all but all people, able bodied or not, needs one of these awesome kitchen gadgets. It's life changing.", "Well maybe Edward Scissorhands", "Plus basic knife skills really aren't that hard. Chopping, slicing, and dicing are all basic skills that are not time sensitive in a home kitchen. Those are literally three things that can easily be learned by watching a basic YouTube video (Binging with Babish did it for me), and can be done with any chef knife that the user finds comfortable.", "Thanks! The one I had only came with a hard plastic thing shaped kind of like a hair pick. So you could only poke it through the holes. It couldn't go in the dishwasher. And obviously a sponge would get cut up and is too big to fit in the holes. So this sounds great and I am off to Amazon :).", "Thank you for the suggestion!", "I mean it's okay if you don't know what a dice is.", "I found a grater that does wavy potato chip slices, grates cheese, something called julienne. I am in love with it", "You know they've got attachments just like a chopper right?"]}
