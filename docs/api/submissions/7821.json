A few years ago Chris\u2019 younger half sister Rachel (27f) started thinking seriously about moving to where we are with hey daughter Delia (6). Rachel is from a HCOL so she wanted to live somewhere less expensive but also have her daughter grow up with family. Rachel is a single mom and Chris and I told her we\u2019d love for them to move out here and we would do whatever we could to help.\n\nRachel & Delia moved out here 6 months ago; they lived with us (no charge) for 3 months until they found their own place, we enrolled Delia in the same school as Megan; they are both in first grade. \n\nRachel drops Delia off here each school day and we take her with Megan and pick them both up every day after school and she is with us until Rachel gets off work, usually 5:45 to 6. On they days when there is no school but R has to work, Delia is with us all day. We don\u2019t ask her to pay us anything for this, \n\nWe always knew this move was going to be a big transition for them, especially Delia. They lived so far away that we never really spent that much time together before but would talk on the phone a lot. \n\nDelia has a temper, she gets mad at the drop of a hat and lashes out (screaming, crying, hitting, kicking & calling names) a lot and Megan takes the brunt of it. On Halloween Rachel was home sick so we offered to keep Delia that night so Rachel could rest & Delia could trick or treat. Delian got mad that Megan wouldn\u2019t give her a specific piece of candy (even though she had her own big bag) and slapped Megan across the face hard enough to leave a handprint on her cheek. I asked her why she would do that, she said it was an accident. We ended her night right then and made her go straight to bed and we told Rachel about it the next day. Delia was on her best behavior for a while after that but it\u2019s been getting bad again lately, only this time, she does it when she thinks no one is looking. \n\nTwo weeks ago at school Delia hit Megan in the face with her jacket and the zipper caught her and cut her forehead. Megan told a teacher but Delia started screaming and crying that it was an accident. The teacher told them to play nicely. Last week on the playground, Delia swung off the monkey bars and kicked Megan really hard in the back, leaving another mark, the teachers again chalked it up to an accident bc Delia was crying that it was an accident. \n\nMy gut tells me these are NOT accidents. I want to support Rachel but she doesn\u2019t seem to take this that seriously. She thinks it\u2019s nothing more than squabbles between two little girls. I can\u2019t have my kid getting hurt anymore. WIBTA if I tell Rachel she can\u2019t depend on me for childcare anymore even though it would put her in a tough financial position?", "created_utc": 1674219044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gw61n/wibta_if_i_stop_watching_my_niece/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's your sil responsibility to address her daughter 's behavior seriously.", "NTA.  That child needs to be evaluated regarding her actions, and might need need treatment.  In the meantime, she is too dangerous to be around your daughter.  You guys have gone above and beyond helping this relative, and she can figure it out from here.", "NTA - You do always have to keep your own children safe, and for that this is a NTA situation. \n\nThis being said, there is no way your niece is behaving like this for no reason. There has to be a root to this kind of behavior and I hope that it is found with compassion and love.", "YWNTBTA in my opinion, although I would speak to her first and tell her that if she does not immediately take this seriously that you will need to do what is best for the safety of your child.", "Why is this even a question? OP, your child\u2019s safety comes first. I understand children can be mean sometimes but its upto parents to correct their childern. I can\u2019t see your SIL correcting her child. \nJust back off from the responsibility of your neice for now. Protect your child", "NTA\n\nTrust your gut instinct, we have it for a reason. These are not accidents, you don't slap someone in the face by accident, especially more than once. She's bullying your daughter and has been getting away with it, hence why it continues. \n\nI'd call the school and insist they be separated at recess and even in the class. Sit your sister down and tell her that it stops now and that she needs to get her daughter some therapy to get to the bottom of this.", "No YWNBTA. By the sounds of it, this is on purpose. You have to protect your own child as this will continue to escalate. Your SIL should deal with the issues in whatever way possible before you agree to have her daughter spend any more time with yours.\n\nPersonally, I would also go to the school to see if they could be put in seperate classes.", "Nta. Your first responsibility is to take care of your child. You know the also on Halloween was on purpose. What are the odds that both of the others were accidents?", "NTA.\nThese are NOT accidents. There's something deeper going on here, and that little girl needs to get into therapy to figure out how to help her. You have a responsibility to keep your daughter safe, and at this point, that means away from her cousin.", "Your daughter have been attacked a total of 3 times and each time the culprit have \u201dcried\u201d and claimed \u201daccident\u201d and the culprits mother refuse to do something about her behavior, so no you won\u2019t be an AH for refusing to watch her any longer despite the Financial problem that C\u2019s halfsister is facing, your daughters health and safety is at risk and you need to do what you need to do to protect her! Don\u2019t forget the three incidents once is a mistake, twice is a coincident and trice is a pattern", "NTA. These are no accidents.

Inform the school as well so your daughter is safe when you\u2019re not there.", "NTA. Once is an accident. Twice is not. Rachel needs to immediately take charge of her daughter else she will be on the recieving end of these accidents soon. Keep your daughter safe. She is your prime responsibility. Everything else is secondary", "NTA, at all. You WBTA if you allowed this to continue. No one accidentally slaps another person across the face, not even a 6 year old. There are clearly issues going on with this child but, at the risk of sounding harsh, they are not your issues. Your issue is that your child is being physically abused by her cousin. Your daughter NEEDS to see you stand up for her and remove the cousin from her life. Not have a sit down and tell her if she does it again she'll won't be welcome back. You've told her that already and clearly she understands because she straightened up for a while, but deep down doesn't believe you'll do it.\n\nDo it. Protect your daughter.", "NTA.

Tell her to mind her own little monster.", "NTA, you have to worry about your kid. Delia starts screaming and crying because of the fear of consequences and because shes learned that pulling that behavior means escaping consequences, not because she feels bad about megan or did it by accident. \n\nI would tell Rachel directly exactly why you can't help her anymore. Delia is also being failed by the adults in her life trying to find an easy way to write off this bad behavior rather than doing the hard thing of addressing it. Hopefully it will be a wake up call for Rachel to get Delia some help and start following through on discipline.", "NTA. \n\nDelia has got issues and needs help, clearly she is a bully. I wonder if she is not jealous of her cousin or just really angry. She also maybe struggling with processing her own emotion in general (worth checking if there are other incidents involving other kids). I would also check out for signs of sensory disorders or autism/adhd as this could also account for sudden mood swing, candy incident (if she is not a spoiled child). It could also be that Rachel simply struggle with parenting. \n\nObviously you need to safeguard your child and can't leave the 2 girls together. I would speak to the teacher ASAP to keep an eye on the situation at school. Honestly, you also need to speak to your SIL before making any decision. Rachel is relaying a lot on you and probably can't afford child care, so the implications gor her of you stopping could be really bad, but tgen again it is not your problem. \n\nThe first step might be that all the adult sit together and make sure that Delia knows that you are aware of what is happening (including the school) and that if any incident happen again at home or school, that she might not be able to come to yours. Your little girl also needs to tell you everything, she might also want to tell her cousin, with you there how she makes her feel. You might also want to take pictures of the marks and keep a diary of incidents to give a fuller picture to mum and Delia (this could help when seeking help for her).\n\nGood luck.", "NTA, seems like Rachel does not have control over D.", "NTA. I have a nephew that is rough with my son and his parents chalk it up to \"boys being boys\". Except it's not and I have several witnesses. He's not allowed unsupervised around my son and basically only see them at holidays bc I'm not risking my son for someone who won't discipline properly.", "NTA. None of these are accidents. She is just learning how to get away with abusing people. You need to protect your daughter.", "NTA, cut the child care and then maybe Rachel will see the seriousness of it. You have to put your child first. Delia is a spoilt brat who has learnt the art of manipulation and she is using it to torment your child. It's probably jealousy because your daughter is in a 2 parent home, but it's still no excuse. \n\nStop immediately because your daughter has to come first.", "Oh no! Poor Megan! Poor Delia! There\u2019s clearly something seriously wrong here and I hope Delia can get whatever help she may need, but that is a thing for her PARENTS to start sorting out, like, IMMEDIATELY. \n\nOP, you are definitely NTA, and I hope you can give us an update because I\u2019m very worried for everyone involved! It\u2019s been a long time since I was 6 years old, but this kind of physical violence can\u2019t possibly be normal, can it?", "NTA I agree with your gut instinct: These are not instincts. \n\nI would however strongly suggest to give a fair warning/ options for going back to watching her.\n\n- if Delia can be good for a while after a stern talking, maybe you could offer to keep watching, if they agree to get professional help, use it as a wake up call\n- if they Rachel refuses to get help, your watching Delia stops within \"reasonable time frame\" (for Megans sake I'd say immediately, she is rightfully your priority, but if you can somewhat supervise and avoid further violence, watching Delia a bit longer to facilitate finding an alternative might keep family peace)\n- even if you don't watch her anymore, because help was refused, try to keep nudging in that direction. The violence is worrysome, might point to some deeply serious issues and Delia might be experiencing/ having experienced violence herself", "In the meantime, you\u2019d be doing everyone a favor if you held the child accountable for these \u2018accidents\u2019. D herself is a victim of her own deviousness, if she is punished, she will learn she won\u2019t get away with it and might stop. If she doesn\u2019t stop, her antisocial behavior will take her down a miserable path.", "They are not in the same class but because they are in the same grade they have lunch and recess at the same time. I emailed both of their teachers and have let them know what\u2019s been happening so they can keep an eye out and make sure they are separated.", "Delia and Megan are not in the same class but since they are in the same grade they go to lunch and recess at the same time. I have emailed both of their teachers to let them know about the situation so that they can keep an eye out.", "I\u2019ve had the same thought.", "It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m turning a blind eye. But i was trying to give Delia the benefit of the doubt at first. I don\u2019t mean that as in, I believe her slapping her on Halloween was an accident, but that she\u2019s a 6 year old girl going through a major life change and has a lot of emotions that at 6 she doesn\u2019t know how to properly express. \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t see her hit her the other two times, I didn\u2019t speak to her mom about it and I absolutely regret that. We will be speaking today though and making it very clear to her that what delia is doing must stop or she has two weeks to secure another form of child care for her, during which time delia will not be allowed into the main part of the house with us. She will have to stay in the part of the house that she and her mom lived in and will be separated from and not allowed to interact with us until her mom can pick her up.", "It means high cost of living.", "We love and treat Delia as if she is our own, this is included disciplining her to a certain degree and her mom is fine with this. When she hit Megan on Halloween, I was really upset with her and told her if I saw her lay another finger on her she would never be allowed back to our home. Her mom knew this too and must have laid into pretty hard at home bc for a few weeks afterwards she was on her best behavior, going out of her way to be nice to Megan. Maybe I\u2019m giving a 6 yo too much credit but the fact that she\u2019s now hitting her when I\u2019m not there feels almost diabolical.", "Thanks for the info, didn't know that one.", "What does your husband say about this situation?\n\nYou\u2019re NTA and you have to protect your daughter. Your niece needs help for her issues and I sincerely hope she gets that help. In the meantime please don\u2019t let her continue to hurt your child because it\u2019s not going to stop. \n\nHitting her hard enough to leave a mark on THREE separate occasions? That you know about at least. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your daughter is scared of her cousin."]}
