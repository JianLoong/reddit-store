A few years ago Chris\u2019 younger half sister Rachel (27f) started thinking seriously about moving to where we are with hey daughter Delia (6). Rachel is from a HCOL so she wanted to live somewhere less expensive but also have her daughter grow up with family. Rachel is a single mom and Chris and I told her we\u2019d love for them to move out here and we would do whatever we could to help.\n\nRachel & Delia moved out here 6 months ago; they lived with us (no charge) for 3 months until they found their own place, we enrolled Delia in the same school as Megan; they are both in first grade. \n\nRachel drops Delia off here each school day and we take her with Megan and pick them both up every day after school and she is with us until Rachel gets off work, usually 5:45 to 6. On they days when there is no school but R has to work, Delia is with us all day. We don\u2019t ask her to pay us anything for this, \n\nWe always knew this move was going to be a big transition for them, especially Delia. They lived so far away that we never really spent that much time together before but would talk on the phone a lot. \n\nDelia has a temper, she gets mad at the drop of a hat and lashes out (screaming, crying, hitting, kicking & calling names) a lot and Megan takes the brunt of it. On Halloween Rachel was home sick so we offered to keep Delia that night so Rachel could rest & Delia could trick or treat. Delian got mad that Megan wouldn\u2019t give her a specific piece of candy (even though she had her own big bag) and slapped Megan across the face hard enough to leave a handprint on her cheek. I asked her why she would do that, she said it was an accident. We ended her night right then and made her go straight to bed and we told Rachel about it the next day. Delia was on her best behavior for a while after that but it\u2019s been getting bad again lately, only this time, she does it when she thinks no one is looking. \n\nTwo weeks ago at school Delia hit Megan in the face with her jacket and the zipper caught her and cut her forehead. Megan told a teacher but Delia started screaming and crying that it was an accident. The teacher told them to play nicely. Last week on the playground, Delia swung off the monkey bars and kicked Megan really hard in the back, leaving another mark, the teachers again chalked it up to an accident bc Delia was crying that it was an accident. \n\nMy gut tells me these are NOT accidents. I want to support Rachel but she doesn\u2019t seem to take this that seriously. She thinks it\u2019s nothing more than squabbles between two little girls. I can\u2019t have my kid getting hurt anymore.

Delia starts screaming and crying because of the fear of consequences and because shes learned that pulling that behavior means escaping consequences, not because she feels bad about megan or did it by accident. \n\nI would tell Rachel directly exactly why you can't help her anymore. Delia is also being failed by the adults in her life trying to find an easy way to write off this bad behavior rather than doing the hard thing of addressing it. Hopefully it will be a wake up call for Rachel to get Delia some help and start following through on discipline.", "NTA. \n\nDelia has got issues and needs help, clearly she is a bully. I wonder if she is not jealous of her cousin or just really angry. She also maybe struggling with processing her own emotion in general (worth checking if there are other incidents involving other kids). I would also check out for signs of sensory disorders or autism/adhd as this could also account for sudden mood swing, candy incident (if she is not a spoiled child). It could also be that Rachel simply struggle with parenting. \n\nObviously you need to safeguard your child and can't leave the 2 girls together. I would speak to the teacher ASAP to keep an eye on the situation at school. Honestly, you also need to speak to your SIL before making any decision. Rachel is relaying a lot on you and probably can't afford child care, so the implications gor her of you stopping could be really bad, but tgen again it is not your problem. \n\nThe first step might be that all the adult sit together and make sure that Delia knows that you are aware of what is happening (including the school) and that if any incident happen again at home or school, that she might not be able to come to yours. Your little girl also needs to tell you everything, she might also want to tell her cousin, with you there how she makes her feel. You might also want to take pictures of the marks and keep a diary of incidents to give a fuller picture to mum and Delia (this could help when seeking help for her).\n\nGood luck.", "NTA, seems like Rachel does not have control over D.", "NTA.

Her mom knew this too and must have laid into pretty hard at home bc for a few weeks afterwards she was on her best behavior, going out of her way to be nice to Megan.

Your kids health and safety comes before anything else, in fact you will be the ah if you don't stop forcing your daughter to put up with her cousin.", "NTA\u2026 but, I don\u2019t think things will end up well if you tell Megan that Delia cannot come over for childcare anymore. \nMegan has been there for 6 months and you have been so supportive in helping her get on her feet!\nIt obvious though that Delia is dealing ( poorly, as is expected of a child who doesn\u2019t know better) with some complicated issues that may be from the move or may be from some previous trauma.\nRefusing to watch Delia will not help the issue, it will likely make it worse considering you will still see them at holidays and such and resentment may make things so much worse! \nEven though your primary responsibility it always your own child, Delia is family and it seems she needs an advocate.\nYou should explain all of the problems you\u2019ve witnessed and strongly encourage therapy to address these behaviors. \nIf Delia is able to get help, it will make things much easier for all of you in the long run.", "I will add warn the school  to be more attentive  to your daughter and Delia as it isn't acceptable  that your  daughter  gets  hit. Tell them what you observed at home.  Nta", "Even if they are accidents (which seems unlikely) the fact is that daughter is getting hurt and that's not right.\n\nHowever, separating them at home is not enough, because a lot is happening at school. So either the kids need to be completely separated at school, or go to separate schools.", "She absolutely needs to be in therapy. That child is a danger to her daughter.", "This absolutely. Something is going on here and yes, 6yo can be this devious. NTA", "At this point OP can claim that Delia is being negligent because she keeps hurting people on accident.", "I\u2019m so sorry you had to experience that.", "No and there can be a million and one other things that are the cause of this without leaping straight to the most demonizing label you can find. Obviously there is something deeply wrong here but it might be something as relatively simple as lack of consequences and Delia being upset by the move. \n\n\nSomething needs to be done and Delia's mom needs to step up and stop ignoring the issue, and Megan needs to be kept safe. But you don't need to leap straight to demonizing a small child you know nothing about.", "Sociopathy is not an actual diagnosis, it\u2019s a pop culture term. Psychopathy is the real psychological term, but still not an actual diagnoses.\nThe closest diagnosis would be anti social personality disorder, but that is not the same as psychopathy as psychopathy is more of a collection of a certain traits and not considered a mental illness.\nRegardless, you can\u2019t be diagnosed with antisocial until you are 18, and it would require a diagnosis of conduct disorder in childhood/adolescence.\nBut as another commenter said, so many things can cause a child to \u201cact out\u201d like this, and it\u2019s so disconcerting to jump to such a stigmatizing label when there are literally hundreds of other explanations.", "They aren\u2019t in the same classroom but because they are in the same grade they have lunch and recess together. The teachers have been made aware of the situation and know to inform me of any incidents.", "They aren\u2019t in the same class, when we enrolled Delia I specifically asked the registrar to make sure they would be in separate classrooms bc I thought they would distract each other too much, I had no fear of her harming my child then. \n\nWe don\u2019t have to watch her on the weekends thankfully.", "So, I tried that yesterday, minus the ice cream. When she and I got home, she immediately went to Megan and told her she\u2019s a jerk and no one likes her. Megan then came running to kitchen to tell me what she said and I decided to let my husband handle her bc I knew I was too emotional to deal with her.", "Good.  The teachers need to know that these are not accidents and that there is a bit of a history.  Maybe even pull in the school counselor in the event other things are happening at school that don't involve your child but other children.  The counselor could be the one to expedite help for this child.", "You also need to be documenting this all with your child\u2019s doctor(s) and the principle, NOT just the teachers\n\nThis will not stop until D is seen by a professional which might escalate the bad behavior. \n\nPaper trail everything. Document everything.", "Teachers don\u2019t supervise recess. At least not at any school with a union. You should be reaching out to the principal/asking who the recess supervisors are. Teachers are pretty powerless to stop anything that doesn\u2019t happen during class time.", "Why put that on the teachers? Y T A for that.", "Thank you. I\u2019m doing well now but it\u2019s also been 10 years since I\u2019ve last seen my cousin so I\u2019m not sure if seeing her would still make me panic or not. I hope things work out well for you and your daughter", "Okay, that's good. Delia may be six, but there's something going on that isn't being addressed. There could be a number of reasons, but I wonder if she's jealous. Rachel has two parents she sees often. Delia has one who works a lot. But if lashing out is causing your daughter harm, her safety must come first.", "Your solution is to leave a 6 year old unsupervised and alone in a part of your house?", "> She will have to stay in the part of the house that she and her mom lived in and will be separated from and not allowed to interact with us until her mom can pick her up.\n\nDoes your daughter like playing with her cousin the other times? \n\nTake a moment to relax. While Reddit is right, execution is important. Doing this will kamikaze this relationship. Maybe mention what's been happening and that the girls are unhappy being with each other 24/7. They are never out of each other's space, and you think it would be healthy for everyone's relationship if there this current arrangement stopped. They need space to start missing each other.", "so your daughter's safety and physical well-being takes a backseat to Delia's benefit of the doubt. your daughter is very young but you better believe she's taking core memories of how her parents keep allowing this to happen.\n\nyou have not been protecting your daughter. do better.", "Did you not notice Delia didn't 'lay a hand' on Megan after getting in trouble for it, but instead *kicked*  her and hit her with a *jacket*? Delia is absolutely aware of what she's doing.", "Delia is showing serious behavioral problems. We don\u2019t know what her upbringing was like so can\u2019t say but it sounds like Delia needs to be evaluated. It feels like this is beyond Reddit\u2019s pay grade.", "Whether these incidents are down to clumsiness or malicious intent, your daughter has been hurt several times by the same kid. That would be enough for me to say they need a break from each other.\n\nYou don't need to turn your back on niece, you can take her out one on one, once a week. If the incidents are malicious, it'd probably be a disaster to cut niece out as she may escalate the behavior at school. \n\nShe's 6 and is probably acting out. You need to shield your daughter even if this makes things tough on SIL. You can always offer support via money or advice.", "Once is an accident \\*if\\* it's something like she tripped and her hand struck Megan on the way down. A slap is not an accident, and leaving marks more than once definitely isn't.", "If I may, threatening her with an abandonment punishment isn\u2019t a good approach, because it\u2019s terminal. If she does it again she\u2019s gone, so what if she does it again in 0.1, or 0.2? Is that enough? People/kids are so smart, she\u2019s sensed the quandary and figured out what the fractional amount she can get away with is.  \n  \nWhat\u2019s wrong with good old timeouts? Sitting still and silent in a location to meditate on your actions while everyone else is allowed to carry on together around you, always worked well for me. Plus there is so much room to play with the intensity of disappointment and disapproval with that one. I also find that many many problems in kids are due to neglect, so it\u2019s better to not add to that. With this approach they are not being sent away. \n  \nEDIT: BTW I think you are a wonderful human for what you have been doing for this child.", "At our school the teachers DO supervise recess.", "Because I can\u2019t be there at school and that is where the last two \u201caccidents\u201d have occurred. Would you not alert your child\u2019s teacher if they were having a problem with another student?!", "I did notice that, and the level of deviousness that is required to continue the bad behavior while \u201ctechnically\u201d obeying me is frankly quite alarming.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with timeouts but for Delia, it just doesn\u2019t seem to be enough. She seems to need a much heavier consequence than just sitting in timeout for a little while.", "i don't think you are wrong about giving Megan some space here cause it really seems obvious its on purpose, but where did she get that violenta urges? did she lived at a violent scenario before? did something happened to her that makes her feel like this is acceptable? maybe talk to Rachel about that and seriously recommend therapy to try and address the issue, its really strange for a kid to become like that unprovoked.", "I don't know if I would call it devious; kids are people. She's got a brain but you're seeing kid logic; she has big feelings from the move, and she's not equipped to deal with that. She's not equipped to deal with a different kid that she lives with *being happy* because she's in distress. Kids have impulse control issues, due to development, so she is handling this the best way she can to get what she needs: attention, expressing her anger and unhappiness. She may genuinely be upset that she has lashed out, and embarrassed, but feel unable to control the situation.\n\nIf you don't get her help she's going to continue handling how she knows. She needs to learn that her method won't *work*, and also learn other coping skills.\n\nKids crave stability and predictability. They crave attachment. Delia has had all that taken away, and it takes time and good parenting to build it back. Threatening to take away her stability was a poor choice. Not only can she not understand fully the ramifications, she now believes that you don't care about her or the mess she's dealing with. You broke her trust in her family's support. *And you didn't mean to*. This is why I say you and your sister need guidance; there are so many pitfalls!\n\nNTA, if your sister isn't taking any further action other than threatening more discord, you need some distance for your daughter. But stop acting like the child is a scheming devil; there's plenty of time to help her past this.", "Hmm, okay. On the one hand, it feels to me like you\u2019ve described the problem with execution of the punishment; it doesn\u2019t come across as serious enough. Maybe it is just me, but I could make kids feel shock and fear with my presence somehow, over imagined further consequences that never happened. I guess I have a very stern demeanor when I want to. I don\u2019t think it is just because I am a man. I had a couple of Welsh women teachers, when I was young, both slight of build, but their strictness coupled with the compassion that my kid mind could feel underneath was the magic combination where they kept me in line, and I would do whatever they said.  \n  \nOn the other hand, you know the situation better than anyone, perhaps Delia needs something more. I don\u2019t know what that would be myself. While I do believe violence is sometimes necessary, I firmly believe it has no place in the disciplining of children.  \n  \nI guess I would myself, take her somewhere private and first apologize to her for threatening to leave her. Say it was a punishment I said but that I regret, describe how much she means to me. Maybe we could have a good cry together. Then talk calmly about the seriousness of hitting other children, and how it will lead to awful consequences for her in life. How she will be avoided by all the people she cares about in life, use the earlier experience between you both as an example. This a is all important because the foundation of great discipline requires a firm belief that you have their best intentions at heart. When you need to discipline her next, your doing it in a sort of temple of care-for-her. The bigger the temple, the louder will seem the punishment. Then really lean in to the timeout. She can sit in a corner in a chair in the lounge all evening while everyone else goes about their business in hushed tones. Everyone pitches in to carry the gravity of the situation. Follow that up with her having to go straight to bed, watch her brush her teeth with your very serious stern face. Walk her to bed. Your own treatment of your well behaved daughter is a contrast all the while, you occasionally helping Megan with her drawing or whatever in between your chores, you both whispering and huddling over her work, briefly. That shit should fucking sting. NGL it\u2019s hard work to keep up the seriousness all night. But I find it hard to imagine it won\u2019t work.", "She doesn\u2019t come from a violent background but Megan has certainly had a cushier life than Delia. Megan has both parents, a stable house with a pool and lots of friends. \n\nDelia\u2019s father has been in the picture intermittently as he is a recovering drug addict and for the first three years of her life was living in the streets and Rachel has done everything she can to protect Delia from him when he\u2019s using but when he is clean she allows him to be around them. \n\nDelia says she just gets so angry. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s simply jealousy or if there is something much deeper that will require serious intervention from professionals, I\u2019m not qualified to say one way or the other, I just have my suspicions.", "The 'devious' part comes from the fact that she is now *deliberately doing it when there is no one to catch her* and because she is following the letter of the law, as it were, by no longer using her hands. This is an additional layer on an already unpleasant problem. \n\nI agree she definitely still needs significant behavioural intervention from a professional.", "uh yeah, she needs professional intervention stat. Get her therapy. Tell the school that there is a concerning pattern of 'accidental' injuries to your daughter.", "I am a parent of a child who was like Delia. She's said the same thing about feeling angry when she would hit. It took a lot of intensive work and consistency to get her to stop acting out and hitting. It needs to be treated seriously. Her mother needs some professional help to work through this. Does the school offer any resources? Your local community services?\n\nFor the record, you are NTA here. You need to do what's best for your daughter, even though Delia is family. If her mom isn't willing or able to put in the work to help her child manage her feelings and outbursts, there is nothing wrong with declining to assist with her care.", "I don't blame Delia for how angry she is. But it's not healthy for either girls to let this behavior continue. Something must change, and keeping the girls apart seem to be a good solution for Megan.\n\nI don't think Delia is devious, she's probably a smart but very angry and sad kid. And professional need to address her distress, and allow her to express it without using violence. It's for her own sake. Your sister needs to be aware of that, and she probably needs to work on her own way to handle it as well. But Megan needs to be shield from all of that."]}
