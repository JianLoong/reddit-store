Tell him the truth.  I know, from experience, that it feels vulnerable and scary to open up about the details of how you manage your mental health.  Especially things that you fear will seem ridiculous to others.  But your husband loves and supports you, and the lie you told is hurting you both.  If you don\u2019t trust him with this, you may form a rift in your relationship that can\u2019t be easily healed.  Take a deep breath and take some time to remind yourself of things he does to support your mental health, to help you build up your courage.  You can do this.  If he\u2019s the good guy he sounds like, he may be sad about this inconvenient coincidence, but he\u2019ll understand why you don\u2019t want to name your child the same thing you call the frustrating and troublesome symptoms of your mental illness.\n\nNAH, you\u2019re just both struggling with something emotional.", "NAH if you tell him why. This name is really important to him and you just saying no seemingly without a reason is hurting him.\n\n(I call my inner self-critic Frank. There\u2019s nothing more satisfying than telling Frank to feck off when I feel like I\u2019m about to spiral. I admire your strategy! It\u2019s a great one. Good luck.)", "Nah. But please be honest with your husband. He deserves to know the truth. Why start your new chapter off on a lie?", "Right now, yes you are at fault. If you don't communicate, your husband will harbor resentment over this stronger than however he might not understand or appreciate the real reason why. This could be similarly personal to him as it is for you, and right now, his personal attachment to this Otis name is being matched with \"I don't like it\".", "NAH\n\nYou're not an ah for being too embarrassed to discuss this with your SO. I don't know if being upset makes your SO an ah either, the name clearly means a lot to him. (Unless he acts distant and sleeps in the guest room any time you have a minor disagreement?) I'm sure that if you could find a way to communicate your issues with the name he would understand why and would not want your first born to be named after something that is quite traumatic for you.\n\nI hope you find the tools and support you need to communicate that. :)", "NTA. It's understandable that you didn't disclose the origin of the name \"Otis\" to your husband earlier, as it may have felt embarrassing to you. It's important to remember that you have the right to express your preferences and concerns about naming your child. While your husband may be hurt, it's crucial for both of you to have open and honest communication about your feelings. Find a calm moment to explain the history behind the name and the significance it holds for you. Together, you can work towards finding a compromise that honors both your husband's grandfather and your own preferences.", "YTA\n\nBecause you definitely hurt your husband by turning down naming the kid after his grandfather..\n.brcause you dont like the name? Just tell him the real reason why. You're justified in not wanting the name, but not justified in lying.", "Ok there's clearly not an ah. Just tell him the actual reason you don't like the name. The way you did it makes you seem calous and petty.", "NTA - It's fair not wanting to name your baby the same name as a disease that has tormented you.  However, it's also fair to explain to him WHY you don't want to use that name.", "NTA just tell him why. And see if you can settle it as a middle name for compromise? Unless that\u2019s a no for you too", "INFO, but it seems a case of NAH\n\nI don't know how the argument developed, but I'm guessing it was pretty bad if he chose to sleep in another room. You should be completely open about it, and even though he doesn't have a right to know if it's something you truly don't want to talk about, he definitely deserves an explanation. He is obviously confused, and this is something he clearly cares about.\n\nYou definitely shouldn't have lied to him about it. You should have told him that there was a deeply personal reason that you still can't share with him.\n\nI personally would come to a compromise of choosing another First Name, and use Otis as a middle name. You won't call him by that name, but it's still a nice way to remember a loved one.", "Nta but you need to be honest with him.", "NTA. But I think you should tell your husband why.", "NTA.\n\nI disagree with the people here who are saying you **owe** your husband an explanation as to why.\n\nYou certainly **can** tell him if you wish, if you think it will help him to understand your position. But you don't owe it to him.\n\n\"No, I don't like that name\" is all the explanation you are required to give - provided that, when you say \"So what about Percival?\" and he says \"No, I don't like that name\", you are prepared to accept that.\n\n*he decided to sleep in the guest room, things have been tense the last few days*\n\nOh, this is petty. He's giving you the cold shoulder? He's gone off to the guest room to sulk? Over a **name?** A thing which has literally a million options, and you are certain to find heaps of names acceptable to you both if you just **talk** about it?\n\nYou two are about to become parents. This is only the first of many, many disagreements you will have over the best way to raise your child: feeding, sleep, discipline, education, hobbies, playdates, allowance, and many more.\n\nIs this what he plans to do every time you have a disagreement? Are you quite sure he is ready to be a father?\n\nI would urge the two of you to get some couples counseling. Not because of a name, FFS. Get some counseling because if he flounces off to the guest room in a snit every time you two have an argument, and you wander round the house thinking \"What do I do now?\", I don't see much future in your relationship. He needs to grow up.", "NTA, but you need to sit down with your husband and tell him the truth. \n\nDon't be embarrassed about it. Tell him the truth, and he will understand. I know there are things we want to keep to ourselves, but this isn't one of them. You can try to compromise by having the grandfather's middle name? Or adding starting the name with an O.", "YTA because you haven't actually told your husband about the whole bit of being told to name your disease, and that, not knowing you would marry someone in the future with a grandfather who had that name, you (sadly) chose the name Otis, and now it is painful for you.\n\nAs it is, this comes across as rejecting your husband, rejecting his grandfather, and dismissing your husband's love for his grandfather.\n\nNames may be a \"two yes\" thing, but if your \"no\" about ***your husband's grandfather*** has no explanation, it's going to hurt him.   This isn't a random name you're rejecting, it is one that means everything to your husband, and is as powerful for him (in a different way) as it is for you.  \n\nCould you deal with \"Otis\" as a middle name, with a different first name for daily use?  \n\nAnd have you considered working with a therapist to deal with your lingering issues around your childhood illness?  There is nothing wrong or unexpected with having lingering issues around a serious childhood illness, but if it creates stress for you, or interferes with your life and relationships, then working with someone to get some adult perspective on it may help you feel better. \n\nIn this particular context, your husband does need some explanation of why you're rejecting what is, to him, an ordinary name with a powerful family connection to someone he loved and lost. \n\nWith good communication, the two of you can work through this.  But if you don't communicate, your actions which are coming across as an arbitrary rejection of something important to him, are going to create lingering problems in your relationship. \n\nIf it is embarrassing or difficult to explain, that isn't bad, it's to be expected.  Maybe write yourself a script to read to him, explaining about your disease, the advice you were give, your choice of name for the disease, and how it still affects you, so that you don't have to hold it all in your head to get it out at once.  You can read the organized, edited document and give him a clear explanation.", "NTA- but tell him, it will help him understand your reluctance. Could you compromise and have Otis as a middle name, maybe?", "NTA.  I do think you should tell him why though, he'll probably be a bit more understanding.  Still at the end of the day, regardless of why you don't like the name, baby names should always be a two yes vote.", "NTA but you need to explain to your husband exactly why you cannot use that name. He may feel that you simply not liking it is not enough reason to veto it and may push harder on the name. Be clear and open about it with him.", "No, of course not. NTA. Naming a child is a two 'yes', one 'no' situation. You both have to like the name, and you have to agree. If one party says the name doesn't work for them, you both have to move on in search for one you *can* agree on.\n\nAnd \"no\" is a complete answer. Demanding to know 'why' someone said no is the precursor to trying to argue or browbeat them into changing their mind. *You don't need a reason.* No is no. When you said no, you weren't inviting a negotiation. The name 'Otis\" doesn't work for you; it doesn't matter why. Time to move on in search of a name you *both* like.\n\nIf your husband can't do that, he's TA. And your marriage is going to have a great many more difficulties if he can't respect the choices you make without trying to wear you down so he can have his way.", "NTA.  There are billions of names in the world, even if you just consider the common ones.  While Otis is a decent name and nobody would question if you two chose to name your son Otis....\n\nThis has to be a joint decision between husband and wife.  If wife doesn't like the name (and reason is not important) it is reasonable for hubby to consider one of billions of possible other names.\n\nIt is NOT reasonable for hubby to get all bent out of shape and sleep in the guest room.  It's nothing to get upset over, at all.  For my kids, I tossed out some names I liked, that my wife didn't.  Eventually, I suggested names that she DID like.  It was so simple.  NO need for conflict.", "NTA. Otis is an ugly name tbh. But perhaps just tell him? I also don\u2019t like how he decided to sleep in the guest room over something like this. It gives manipulative and passive aggressive. That\u2019s just me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Baby\u2019s names have to be desired by both. The very simple fact of op not wanting it should\u2019ve been the end of the subject. \n\nAlso the person who resorts to the silent treatment and guilting their pregnant wife over her not wanting to name their child a name she dislikes makes is the asshole.", "\"I don't like the name\"  is a perfectly valid reason for not choosing a name.", "NO. By demanding a reason, husband is trying to start an argument in which he'll claim her reason isn't valid.", "If it was just a random name, I'd agree that no explanation is needed.\n\nBut it isn't a random name.  It's a name that has very, very powerful meaning for him.  It's his beloved grandfather.  He's made himself vulnerable, explaining why the name means so much to him.\n\n\"No is a complete sentence\" is for professional settings and casual relationships.  Not for intimate family issues. \n\nRejecting a memorial to the grandfather he loved has left him confused and hurt, because it isn't \"just a name\" it's a legacy of someone he cared deeply about.  \n\nRejecting \"just a name\" won't hurt a relationship.  But dismissing the powerful feelings the husband has in  regards to this particular name is going to hurt the relationship.  He shared his feelings, why it is important to him, and those feelings are being dismissed without explanation. \n\n\"I don't care what you want, I don't like it, you can't have it, and why I'm rejecting this thing that means a lot to you is none of your business\" is not the foundation of a loving marriage.", "Consider that this isn't just some name the Husband likes, though.

It definitely would to me", "I can see how it reads as passive agressive, but maybe he's feeling really overwhelmed by his emotions and doesn't want to lash out so is giving space until he can work out a calm way to communicate his feelings? Idk, my partner and I do this sometimes (but we also check in once the initial wave of emotion is over and say I just need some space to process etc)", "What you would rather is irrelevant when it comes to helping OP, and deliberately not attempting to reach understandings is a great way to destroy trust \ud83d\udc4d", "I agree.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t say that at first.

He asked why, she got \u2018too embarrassed to say why\u2019 and then said she didn\u2019t like the name.\n\nEmbarrassment is valid. Feelings are valid. But this reads to me like she telegraphed that there\u2019s another reason and he feels hurt that she won\u2019t tell him. And that his grandfather\u2019s name is being dismissed as a result.", "Wow.  You seem to believe that a marriage is nothing but a competition, each fighting for dominance.  \n\nHe has exactly as much to name the child as she does.", "That's pretty assumptive. No one is demanding a reason. She gave a fake reason that comes across as quite shallow when he's talking about honoring someone he dearly loved. Then the conversation ended. \n\nif that's your lens of the situation, I assume you've been in/observed some hecking dysfunctional relationships?", "I just reread the post. Nowhere does it say OP\u2019s husband demanded a thing. OP voluntarily said no with a blatant lie. She needs to be honest instead of assuming that he\u2019ll judge her for what she considers embarrassing. He clearly loves her despite her diagnosis, which is awesome, so I highly doubt he\u2019ll call her reasons invalid.", "I went back over OP's post, looking for every mention of the deceased grandfather.\n\n*My husband suggested we name him after his grandfather (Otis) who'd passed away nearly 2 years ago*\n\n*I told him that although I loved his grandfather I couldn't see us naming our son (Otis) he got upset questioning why*\n\nThat's it. That's the sum total of references to the grandfather.\n\nYou talk about \"very, very powerful meaning\" and her husband \"making himself vulnerable\" and \"sharing his feelings, why it is important to him\" and \"explaining why the name means so much to him\". You're reading rather a lot into it, because I don't see any of that in OP's post.\n\nFor all we know, Otis could be nothing more than a name traditionally given to boys in the family, a name OP's husband happens to like and always had his eye on as a name for his future child. He could be merely upset that OP didn't enthusiastically welcome his suggestion. He may even have some bizarre idea that as the father, he has the right to name the male children. (I have met a few people like that. Fortunately they seem to be a dying breed.)\n\nBasically, we don't know, because OP didn't tell us, and you're reading into her post an awful lot of things she didn't actually say.\n\nI agree that OP's position would be easier if she could bring herself to tell him, but that's very different from **owing** him an explanation. The OCD is hers. She has the right to disclose aspects of it, or keep them to herself.\n\nIn your last line, you mention that her refusal to tell him, as though she doesn't care about his feelings, is not the foundation of a loving marriage. His retreat to the guest room after their disagreement is even less of a foundation for a loving marriage. Frankly, if they don't learn to resolve conflict in more productive ways, I don't have a lot of hope for this relationship. That's why I suggested counseling.", "You mean like the act of ignoring your SO and moving to a guest room to punish her for doing nothing wrong?", "Well, this one is, or he would accept that Otis isn't a name she likes.

What's wrong with H. pizza? Do you have something against pineapple? Pineapple's good! WHY DON'T YOU LIKE IT?*\n\nThey're trying to argue taste, and taste isn't arguable, whether its Hawaiian pizza or the name Otis.", "The lack of punctuation makes this hard to follow, but here's the passage:\n\n*\"he got upset questioning why I being too embarrassed to say why just said I don\u2019t like the name\"*\n\nHusband got upset and questioned why. OP was too embarrassed and just said she doesn't like it.\n\nIn other words, OP turned down the name, and then husband demanded to know why. He's clearly trying to start an argument over it to try and change her mind, or at least quell her opposition.", "Read it again. He wants to know why. The OP ran some sentences together, so its easy to miss, but it's there.", ">Well, this one is, or he would accept that Otis isn't a name she likes\n\nYou're just saying that he must obey her wishes.  That's not how marriage works.\n\n> Partner: Do you like Hawaiian pizza?\n\n\"I don't so you're never allowed to have any\"\n\nThat's what you think is normal.", ">In other words, OP turned down the name, and then husband demanded to know why.\n\nWhich is his right.\n\n> He's clearly trying to start an argument over it to try and change her mind\n\nYou really have seen a lot of disfunctional relationships", "A question is not a demand. He ASKED why, and she answered with a lie. She just needs to be honest and communicate with her husband.", "Asking why is a totally normal and valid question in a marriage. Nothing in this whole post makes OP or the husband sound toxic. That is just in your head.", "It's causing the OP distress, so she's feeling it like a demand.\n\nAnd once again, if someone says \"no\", and you want to know why, you're attempting to litigate that refusal.", "Not if you march off to sleep on the couch because you don't like the reason she gives you.", "You are again exaggerating. He didn't 'march off', he decided to take some alone time because OP wasn't being honest and came across as not caring by doing so. \n\nThat is a healthy way of dealing with it so it doesn't escalate, he has some time to himself to think instead of act. \n\nFor OP the name has meaning too but not in the same way as for their husband. Getting a important name shut down without an honest conversation is frustrating. The best way to deal with a conversation going nowhere and only growing tense is to walk away."]}
