You need bathrooms, a place to have food and people to be able to socialize comfortably. What about older guests, kids? The weather could be brutal during your wedding? PLEASE reconsider, surely you can plan for something more sensible within your budget. Your mom is probably imagining what happen if you go with your current plans, hence why she's hinting at possibly helping you financially.

Young adults have terrible ideas.", "Gentle YTA because Colorado in December is very cold. It\u2019s one thing to hike in snow and another to stand around for an extended period of time. An outdoor wedding should be lovely if you keep it brief but even with blankets and hot chocolate your guests will freeze after the ceremony. Don\u2019t do this to people you love. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to pay for another venue you should see if there are any large breweries nearby you can go to after the ceremony to warm up.

Winter weather conditions can change for the worst very fast.\n\nAll of this sounds dangerous and not thought out.", "YTA\n\nAre you from Colorado??? You want people to stand in the cold and snow for up to 6 hours and only have hot chocolate and empanadas??? I hope this is a joke. You could even rent a ballroom tent with heaters for the indoor part to keep the winter scene. But that\u2019s if there\u2019s no snow storm. You can have a nice wedding for $5k.

Restaurants have function/private rooms for this and I'm sure you could find one in your budget. Have some drinks and real food *in the warmth*\n\nStanding outdoors in December and picking at snack foods sounds like an awful experience, and whilst your wedding is for you and your HTB, the reception is meant to be everyone celebrating with you. If you go ahead with this plan people will never look back on this fondly. It'll be \"do you remember when we had to stand in the cold for hours and it threw dad's back out?\" \"Yeah, and poor grandma was in bed for a week with that nasty head cold!\"\n\nThere is nothing wrong with doing a wedding on a shoestring budget, but OP this isn't the way, I'm sorry.", "Most people who are doing a winter wedding have the ceremony outside, but then have an inside reception.

Be prepared for those who understand what this entails to nope right out of it.", "YTA.\n\nI looked up the average temps and while it\u2019s not awful on average, it\u2019s still too cold to be standing outside for 2-3 hours.

Or the food hot?", "Hey, the teenager thinks that her standing in the cold is akin to older people sitting longer in the cold. (BTW, no,  having been a teen and an adult, I can tell you that they are not at all comparable; what you're anticipating that you'll experience is not what the adults and older folks will be experiencing.) Honestly, I'd tell you that you need to grow up a bit before you start making adult decisions because it sounds like you're still thinking like a teen (not even a young adult), but teens are impervious to being told that they're not processing info the way pretty much everyone else does. \n\nYTA", "Renting giant propane heaters...\n\nPaying for port-a-potties...\n\nKeeping food and drinks warm...\n\nTrying to dance in thick boots and long coats...\n\nHaving the rings freeze to your fingers...\n\nYou'd probably be spending more money trying to be frugal than if you just rented the local VFW hall and had outdoor activities for those who wanted.\n\nYTA", "YTA if you think family will stay outside without bathrooms for hours. \n\nHad a wedding in October in a cold state bc frankly it\u2019s when we could. 70 degrees day before, 40 degrees day off.

At least rent a handful of those propane burner things that outdoor restaurants use.", "You\u2019re aware you can rent outdoor heaters right?  The kind that outdoor bars and restaurants have to keep guests warm.  You can rent maybe 4-6 of them to keep the wedding party + 20 or so guests toasty warm in the outdoors.  If the whole budget of the wedding is $5k, renting them for $25-$50 each shouldn\u2019t be too much of an ask.  Cheaper than buying new blankets to wrap around people wearing their best outfits.", "Do it on a 14er. A real one. Not Sherman.", "Yta this has got to be fake.

I hope you\u2019re at least letting everyone in the wedding party wear long sleeves. Blankets and hot drinks are alright. However, is it true that you really won\u2019t have any access to bathrooms for your guests? What happens if somebody has a digestive issue or just really needs to go? I get that you want to save money, but don\u2019t do it at the expense of your guests.", "Yes!

I sure wouldn't.", "YTA. Well more like you\u2019re the idiot. \n\nWhen was the last time you stood outside in December for three+ hours (including set up and break down)? Thing is, you are right, they are free not to come. However how are you going to feel when a lot of people start declining like her. Don\u2019t you want your friends and family to be there?", "YTA. For the amount of the skate park and empanadas you can rent a room at a brewery or restaurant. Or the gym of a tiny school or meeting room in a library or hotel. I live in colorado and it could literally blizzard that day and then what. Why skate park? Does it have a great gazebo? Did you two meet while skating? This is a terrible idea. (Even if you brought in propane heaters and blankets it would cost the amount to rent an indoor space).", "Oh dear. I've done a wedding for 5K, and it was delightful, but I think this requires a bit more thought.

And some people might think you\u2019re excluding them on purpose by having it outside where you should know they would not attend (people take everything personally). \n\nI got married in Colorado (in June but still). You should check around at the local hotels. Your budget could probably cover a small room with up to 30 guests. You could still do the ceremony outside. I got married in the busiest month with 30 guests at a popular hotel and it was half your budget with food. That was well before Covid and all the food prices going up but it\u2019s still worth checking out. You might also be able to reserve a table at a local restaurant or brewery. They might even let you have their patio with heaters if you really want everyone outside. Check with the bathrooms at the state park as some close down in the winter. You don\u2019t want to promise your mom a restroom only to find that it\u2019s locked. \n\nGood luck OP and congrats on the marriage.\n\nEdit to add- If you do go with the whole thing outside make sure it\u2019s from like noon to four because that will be the warmest part of the day and you\u2019ll have more luck with the temperatures.

Semi-traditional, but he'll blend into the background.", "NTA\n\nI'm all for cheap weddings, but at Burger King you would have a nice warm place and for 260 Dollar you can have food, too... Or at Wendys or Starbucks... After all it is only for 2 hours.", "Slight YTA. You and your fiance are young and on a tight budget, which is doable. However, you should consider other options that will be comfortable for your guests. If the wedding is just for you two, I recommend eloping. I had a wedding of 20 guests and managed a quick ceremony at a cheap chapel, and took everyone to dinner at a restaurant. The whole thing including our outfits was under $5000. \n\nYou have plenty of time to figure out a venue and keep it cheap. I highly recommend taking advice of people you care about and showing that you care if they show up. Try following Jamie Wolfer on YouTube. She is a wedding planner and has many advice videos for budget weddings.", "NAH, if you don't really care for the presence of many of the invited. But i'm interested what do you plan to do. Guess that dancing won't be very comfortable in winter clothes, staying at one place also isn't very nice after a while.

We are planning on something small with maybe 20 guests as we have a small budget. No florals to save money and no catering just some snacks and a couple trays of empanadas from a local business. We found a cheap state park venue that would cost us $260 for 6 hours. No one else in either of our families is pitching in for the wedding financially so we are working in a 5k budget. The only thing my mom requested was bathrooms although the ceremony and reception will only be 2 to 2.5 hours.  \nNow the problem. The wedding is in Colorado. December is a perfect time for a Winter Wonderland wedding if a little cold. I am fine with just trying to keep warm for a few hours and so is my Fianc\u00e9 and our wedding parties. We are planning on a hot chocolate and hot cider bar, having blankets for every guest, and anyone older that wouldn't do well in the cold or can't travel is invited to attend virtually as well.  \nI was on the phone with my aunt maybe a month ago talking about the wedding and how it was outdoors. After I said we found a cheap outdoor venue she asked, \"So the Ceremony is outside and then we will drive to the reception?\" I replied \"no.\" She then asked if there was somewhere warm for people to go if it got too cold outside and I said there wasn't.

Lasted ten minutes. Charm8ng, but impractical.", "Solid point. Let's see what OP says.", "LOL!", "Not saying the outdoor wedding is a good idea AT ALL. I wouldn't have an 100% outdoor wedding in CO any month of the year, the weather is very unpredictable.\n\nI am just responding to the Canadian poster claiming that it will be below freezing during the day and the guests are a serious risk of frostbite. Likewise OP's fantasy about a 'winter wonderland' - Colorado is just not the freezing cold snowy place that people seem to think it is."]}
