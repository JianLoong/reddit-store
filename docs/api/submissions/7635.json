No one in either of your families are entitled to any of your medical information. It\u2019s none of their business and what MIL did is completely unacceptable. I\u2019m sorry your day was ruined.", "The pregnancy is irrelevant. Someone who speeches that the current wedding is bad and ungodly at the wedding itself deserves to be tossed out.  \n\n\nNTA.", "So imma guess that these people are quite conservative and wanted to \"humiliate\" you two with your pregnancy ie. sex outside of marriage\n\nNTA", "Pregnancy is a scary time. You don't owe anyone anything. While it is common to disclose it after 12 weeks, you take your time. \n\nYour in laws should be ashamed of themselves. Your Mil especially.\n\nYour family agreeing with them? It's just as bad. You don't need people who don't support you around in one of the happiest times of your life.", "NTA. What absolutely ridiculous people! That level of entitlement is disgusting.", "NTA. It\u2019s not for anyone but you and your husband to announce your pregnancy. Wedding is hardly the time to bring up exes seriously how could she think that is appropriate.", "NTA\n\nYour husband has a spine of steel and neither of you overreacted to your MIL's *outrageously* rude speech. Your in-laws deserved to be kicked out off your wedding and cut off for what they did.\n\nAlso, this has nothing to do with you not telling them about the pregnancy. This is about your in-laws believing (and announcing to your guests *at your wedding*) that your husband should've married someone else and that God doesn't approve of your union. The family members who are essentially backing your in-laws on this can get in the bin, quite frankly.", "NTA.\n\n1) the hell is she bringing up an ex for and saying he's destined to be with her?\n2) the hell is she saying 'god didn't approve of'?\n3) your pregnancy is you and your husbands right to announce to people in your time. Not hers.\n\nShe's lucky to be escorted out. If she can't see how that insulted you on a day that should've been all about joy for you both, then she clearly has something wrong with her.", "NTA. You have to know you\u2019re not TA, come on.", "NTA;\n\nFIRST; most people don't announce a pregnancy until the END of the first trimester as the largest volume of miscarriages happen in weeks 1-12. This is COMMON, nothing being hidden, just being smart. \n\nSecond; she made a scene at your wedding. YOUR WEDDING. You have every right to uninvite or remove whomever you please in your special day. \n\nIgnore them. If your hubby is standing by the choice, that's all that matters.\n\nEdit to add; don't take the first part and run away with it. No fear! And congratulations <3", "MIL did well to be escorted away.  For even bringing up your husband's ex during her speech, she should have been given a rocket in her a$$.\n\nNobody's business about the pregnancy.  People like that always try to figure out conception based on due date, anyway, just so they have something to judge you for.\n\nIf you ever let the back into your lives, please make sure you have solid agreed boundaries in place. Any snippy comments, go no to low contact again.\n\nNTA", "NTA in any way shape or form! How dare your MIL announce your pregnancy at your wedding, what an evil woman. I would not speak with them again until they come crawling back with a massive apology. Extended family need a damn wake up call as well.", "NTA.\n\nWhether and when you announce your pregnancy is nobody\u2019s decision but you and your husband\u2019s.\n\nHe did the right thing by going NC. Keep that boundary up!\n\nYou must feel so overwhelmed at having this huge event and being pregnant and then your MIL\u2019s antics.\n\nTake a deep breath and remember- the silver lining is your children will never be subjected to this because being NC with your in laws protects them - as well as you - from abuse.", "NTA     I would have made a very nice \u201cresponse \u201c speech instead of throwing her out - something humble and classy - that got the guests to understand your position sympathize with you, but it\u2019s hard to think of things like that on the fly.   \n\nAnyway with in laws like that I would be moving out of state to put some distance and reduce contact.", "Nta.", "NTA. You're completely in the right here.", "Holy fuck no, no one \u201cdeserved\u201d to know about your pregnancy. You are not an object that belongs to them.

And you're 2 months gone, anyone who is calling you out for not having had a big announcement at this point is an unreasonable AH.", "\u201cShe said some lovely words and blessed our marriage \u201c. \n\nWhat?! No she did not \u201csay lovely words and bless your marriage \u201c. What she did was bring up a old girlfriend and say you were a inappropriate partner for her son.. and announce a pregnancy that you wanted to announce yourselves!! \n\nAre these people nuts?! Did they NOT hear her little diatribe?! \n\nI\u2019m so glad your husband stood up for you and your brother too. \n\nI\u2019d go STAY no \ncontact and say why until they apologized to you both. \n\nNTA\n\nEdited to add the time to announce a pregnancy is when YOU and your husband are ready to announce it. Not the family members.", "NTA and I'm not understanding why the pregnancy issue is what is being focused on.  She ruined your wedding by basically saying your now husband should still be with his ex, not you.  Who does that...You can tell your pregnancy news to who you want, when you want.  It was not her place to tell people regardless of the situation.", "NTA, it's up to the pregnant person when they want to announce most wait till after the first 3 months due to higher miscarriage rates at the beginning of pregnancy and to bring u0 his ex during her wedding speech? Vile behaviour", "I would\u2019ve punched her in the face, not escorted her out. How dare she? How dare the rest of the family saying that they \u2018deserved\u2019 to know?
