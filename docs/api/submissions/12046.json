My ex-wife and one of my good friends got together when I was working out of the country and conceived a child. At the time, we were letting the friend stay at our so he wouldn't be homeless.\n\nAn even better friend of mine knew it was going on the whole time as the cheating friend confessed everything, but no one ever said a word to me about it.

There was zero chance it was mine since it'd been over 2 months since we last saw each other.\n\nI didn't really blame the friend at the time for not telling me.

You have to understand that in addition to emotional betrayal (which is the least important thing), cheating in a couple can be something dangerous.  The person who cheats can infect her partner with an endless number of STDs, which can be transmitted orally, vaginally or anally, and that would be something horrible.  People always talk about the pain of betrayal, but for me the worst thing is always putting your partner at risk like that, taking into account that not even using a condom is 100% protected against an STD.  When telling her you are taking care of her, and whether or not your friendship ends, you should be calm because you always took care of her and guilt should not have a place in you.  You did the right thing.\n\nby the way this is one of the reasons why I will never cover up for someone who cheats on their partner, even if they are my friend.  Knowing and doing nothing makes people accomplices.  People deserve to be able to act based on knowledge of the situation and not based on ignorance.
