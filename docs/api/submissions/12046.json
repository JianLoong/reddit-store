The post questions whether or not the poster was wrong to do so, as some of their mutual friends are saying that they should have stayed out of it and not gotten involved in their friend's relationship.\n\nIn this case, the poster did the right thing by telling their friend the truth. Their friend had a right to know that her boyfriend was cheating on her, and the poster felt that it was the right thing to do to let her know. While it's understandable that their friend may be hurt and angry with them, ultimately, the truth needed to come out.\n\nTherefore, the statement explaining the same is: The poster is not the asshole (NTA) for telling their friend the truth about her cheating boyfriend, as it was the right thing to do.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes people shoot the messenger. That doesn\u2019t make the messenger an asshole.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you were in this situation. I think you did the right thing. I'd certainly want to know this information if it was me, and I'd be devastated if a friend of mine knew that a partner was cheating and didn't say anything.\n\nYou haven't ruined anything. I hope your friend comes around and sees that you did her an enormous favor.", "NTA\n\nPeople always have the right to know if they are being cheated on.\n\nI've told my friend she was being cheated on and she got upset at me. But I feel like her self-respect is more important than our friendship.\n\nShe would've been more upset if you knowingly hid the affair", "NTA.  You didn't ruin your friendship.  Her transference is what's going to ruin your friendship if she doesn't realize she's being irrational soon.", "NTA, look she's upset right now. But, I am willing to bet once she's had time to process and heal she will be thankful. You did the right thing. Sometimes the right thing hurts. Just keep being there for her.", "NTA in the slightest, if your \"friend\" has an issue with you puttin her feelings before your own then that isn't a friend! I'm sure she would've been hurt had she found out later down the line and then finding out you knew for weeks/months or however long it is later", "NTA\n\nEveryone needs a friend like you and you did the right thing. A real friend helps and is honest, minding your business is not the best thing at times \n\nUnfortunately you are experiencing what we call, shooting the messenger. Your friend is mad and hurt at the whole situation and taking it out on the wrong person.\n\nOne day you will look back at this and she will realize you saved her from a bad relationship.", "NTA, you did the best and most caring thing you could for your best friend by telling her the truth. If you hadn\u2019t and she\u2019d found out you knew, she\u2019d have every right to be upset with you. You had no obligation to anybody to hide her bf\u2019s cheating from her.", "NTA\n\nI hate the idea that someone else cheating in a relationship is none of your business, therefore the other person doesn't have the right to know.\n\nIt's an AH move to remain quiet. This is how cheaters get away with cheating for so long because friends don't say anything.", "NTA   \n\nBetter to tell the truth and lose the friendship.   \n\nIf you truly love someone your make sure they are not harmed.   You saw she was being harmed and you had to tell her.  \n\nShe may eventually come to see that you did what you did out of love and become friendly again.", "Bad news messengers always get beaten up. That\u2019s why many pass on that option. What happens to your relationship depends not on you but on your friend. You haven\u2019t wronged her.", "NTA - You did the right thing , keep quiet was not gonna end well\nGive her some time and stay supportive", "NTA. You did your friend a great service. She is just showing that she is not a good friend, blaming you instead of her BF. She might also be listening to the wrong voices in her life. Give her sometime and see if she comes around. If not, you are probably better off. Again, you did the right thing.", "Lol what an ungrateful friend is this, you opened her eyes and you did WELL! bravo , and she gets angry to you for what? NTA , you would be one only if you hid it.", "NAH.  Imagine how she would react if she found out you knew and never told her. I think right now she\u2019s just trying to deal with all the emotions and I\u2019d bet it\u2019s impacting other relationships too, not just yours. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH either. Give it time and continue to be supportive and hopefully she will come around.", "You did the right thing, but your friend needs time.  Try to be patient with her while she works through this; eventually she will hopefully appreciate your honesty, but at the moment it\u2019s going to hard for her not to associate you with learning something really painful.  NAH.", "NAH she's definitely upset (not at you but the situation) and she might be taking it out on you because while yes you did cause this, I commend you for doing so. You were looking out for someone you cared about. Cheating isn't ok and you didn't overstep. Give her time to calm down and she will appreciate you in due time", "NTA. If she had found out later that you knew and didn't tell her, she'd be even more pissed at you. I think she's just grieving what happened and shooting the messenger a bit in the process. \n\nCommunicate with her about what you're feeling and offer to give her a bit of space while she works through things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her emotions are all over the place. Technically OP is the cause of her breakup, not in a bad way but it is. She can't yell at her ex about this pain, he's already blocked, so she's mad at OP. I would suggest OP leaving the friend be for now because I'm sure the friend needs time to go through all the things she's feeling right now. If they don't end up staying friends, I still don't blame anyone, emotions are powerful."]}
