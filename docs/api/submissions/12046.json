The post questions whether or not the poster was wrong to do so, as some of their mutual friends are saying that they should have stayed out of it and not gotten involved in their friend's relationship.\n\nIn this case, the poster did the right thing by telling their friend the truth. Their friend had a right to know that her boyfriend was cheating on her, and the poster felt that it was the right thing to do to let her know. While it's understandable that their friend may be hurt and angry with them, ultimately, the truth needed to come out.\n\nTherefore, the statement explaining the same is: The poster is not the asshole (NTA) for telling their friend the truth about her cheating boyfriend, as it was the right thing to do.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think you did the right thing. I'd certainly want to know this information if it was me, and I'd be devastated if a friend of mine knew that a partner was cheating and didn't say anything.\n\nYou haven't ruined anything.

But I feel like her self-respect is more important than our friendship.\n\nShe would've been more upset if you knowingly hid the affair", "NTA.  You didn't ruin your friendship.  Her transference is what's going to ruin your friendship if she doesn't realize she's being irrational soon.", "NTA, look she's upset right now. But, I am willing to bet once she's had time to process and heal she will be thankful. You did the right thing. Sometimes the right thing hurts. Just keep being there for her.", "NTA in the slightest, if your \"friend\" has an issue with you puttin her feelings before your own then that isn't a friend!

You had no obligation to anybody to hide her bf\u2019s cheating from her.", "NTA\n\nI hate the idea that someone else cheating in a relationship is none of your business, therefore the other person doesn't have the right to know.\n\nIt's an AH move to remain quiet. This is how cheaters get away with cheating for so long because friends don't say anything.", "NTA   \n\nBetter to tell the truth and lose the friendship.   \n\nIf you truly love someone your make sure they are not harmed.   You saw she was being harmed and you had to tell her.  \n\nShe may eventually come to see that you did what you did out of love and become friendly again.", "Bad news messengers always get beaten up.

NAH.", "NAH she's definitely upset (not at you but the situation) and she might be taking it out on you because while yes you did cause this, I commend you for doing so. You were looking out for someone you cared about. Cheating isn't ok and you didn't overstep. Give her time to calm down and she will appreciate you in due time", "NTA. If she had found out later that you knew and didn't tell her, she'd be even more pissed at you. I think she's just grieving what happened and shooting the messenger a bit in the process. \n\nCommunicate with her about what you're feeling and offer to give her a bit of space while she works through things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I always said that of course I would tell a friend if they were being cheated on. Then a friend of mine, who had been cheated on before I knew her, said the last thing she would have needed was someone to tell her. It would have been so humiliating that others knew when she didn't. It was better for her to find out on her own.\n\nYou did what most people would do to protect a friend. Hopefully, she'll come around when the pain isn't so fresh.", "NTA good friends tell their friends when they're being wronged.  If she can't aceite that,  then maybe she just revealed herself to be not a good a friend.  She's hurting and taking it out on you.", "NTA!  If you knew & didn\u2019t tell her and then she found out you knew\u2026she\u2019d be mad too.  You were in a no win situation, but it\u2019s up to her how she handles it.  \n\nIn my 20\u2019s my best friend was living with her fianc\u00e9.  This guy was hitting on me all the time and I figure if he\u2019s doing it to me, who else is he doing it to??  I told my bf what had been happening and she told me to learn how to take a joke & how he\u2019s not like that.  I told her he wasn\u2019t joking or I wouldn\u2019t have brought it up.  Plus, it made me really uncomfortable\u2026I just knew it wasn\u2019t a joke.  She stopped talking to me.  A couple years later I saw her; she told me they broke up because she found out he had been cheating on her.  She apologized to me for not listening.", "The act of a real friend is to let her know what you know, expect that will bite you in the a when she calms down and begins to second guess leaving him, etc., and be willing to deal with it.  \n\nMany friends understand this and never say anything.  Later the person cheated on finds out he/she was the only one who didn\u2019t knows and they get mad at their friends for not saying anything. \n\nNext time, find a way to put the evidence in front of the friend without your being attached to it.  That allows the information to get through and also allows the friend to ignore it if that id the decision.", "Yep. As someone who has been the one being cheated on in the story, I 100% agree. My ex-wife and one of my good friends got together when I was working out of the country and conceived a child. At the time, we were letting the friend stay at our so he wouldn't be homeless. \n\nAn even better friend of mine knew it was going on the whole time as the cheating friend confessed everything, but no one ever said a word to me about it. I only found out when ex told she was pregnant. There was zero chance it was mine since it'd been over 2 months since we last saw each other. \n\nI didn't really blame the friend at the time for not telling me. Everyone involved was close, and my friend who knew was put in a really tough spot. I mostly still don't hold it against him, but it changed our relationship a lot. Especially since he spent the next few years constantly bringing it up and apologizing for not telling me when it was the last thing I wanted to talk about. \n\nWe're still in contact, but we talk less and less. It all made me realize that I would absolutely same something to my friend in that situation. Regardless of the consequences, people to deserve to know when their partner is being unfaithful."]}
