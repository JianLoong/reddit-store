{"id": 34147, "submission_id": "18wk5fp", "title": "AITA for giving my cousins exactly what they gave me?", "selftext": "Hey, this is a repost. I\u2019m gonna try to reword some of this to make it more clear that this is an AITA and not petty revenge.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve (Teenage F) been close with my two cousins (23 F & 26 F) for as long as I can remember. Our moms are really good about keeping our families close, and they\u2019re the only cousins I ever see because family bonds are not strong on my Dad\u2019s side.\n\nRecently, my two cousins have both gotten engaged and the older one is now married. Their respective fiancee and husband join our families for Christmas. Last year, when Christmas rolled around, I was super excited to shop for gifts for my cousins and their sig others! I picked out thoughtful, $25+ gifts for each of them, spent my own, saved money (I do not have a job because I\u2019m not old enough for most of them yet) and hand wrapped all of their gifts. I was fine with this financial blow because I genuinely enjoy gift giving and I love my cousins and their significant others. When I opened their gift to me, I was kind of shocked. All four of them each pitched in a whopping $6.25 for a $25 amazon gift card as my combined Christmas/birthday gift from all of them. I bit back my surprise, despite being hurt that our relationship was diminished to $6.25 from each of them for my two most important holidays. They all loved each of their thoughtful gifts (keep in mind this was the second year they spent money separate from their parents to give gifts, and I\u2019m already doing it at a MUCH younger age than when they started).\n\nNow, here\u2019s where i\u2019m the asshole. Christmas came by again and I carefully wrapped $6.25 and put it under the tree for each of them. They unwrapped it and shared a glance. My oldest cousin looked at me and laughed as if there was some mistake. \u201cSix dollars and a quarter?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes. I figured it was appropriate and I didn\u2019t want you to go feeling all upstaged like you did last year!\u201d I said while smiling a little too hard. My mother knew of my plan so she expected it but the rest of the family erupted in outrage. I was told by my aunt and uncle that I was disrespectful, cruel, and materialistic. I get what they\u2019re saying and i understand that gift giving is a spirit and not a transaction, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling extremely disappointed that my cousins and their sig others thought their gift to me was appropriate given the time and effort i took with mine (they\u2019re both new families so of course money is on the tighter side, but my cousins came wearing 300 dollar shoes and the newest phones and a ps5 and stanley cups, so I just wish a little bit of that could\u2019ve been directed at me given how close we were). So am I the asshole for humiliating them? My reaction was petty and rude, but was it fitting and deserved?\n\nEDIT: ALRIGHT TO SAVE MY FINGERS FROM TYPING THIS IN THE COMMENTS YET AGAIN\u2026 They gave another 25 dollar gift card this year. In an effort to sort of patch up what happened last year, when my aunt asked (as she does every year) for my wishlist, my mom sent her one with several 25 dollar options so that I could actually open a tangible item. Me and my mom designed this wishlist so that they could get me something of 25 dollar value but put a bit of thought and effort into it. They didn\u2019t even click on the link and they gave just another 25 dollar amazon gift card this year.\n\nEDIT 2: It was agreed upon that about 20-30 bucks per gift for each person was appropriate. They spent that much, just ALL FOUR OF THEM TOGETHER. Part of me wonders if they all went in on that so they could just loophole the budget.\n\nEDIT 3: Ok, so because y\u2019all want to know, I did ask my mom if she would maybe talk to my aunt and have her talk to everyone and make kind of a non-targeted announcement about gift giving and the expectations. She said she wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that because she doesn\u2019t know how she would start the conversation. I\u2019ve seen people say i should\u2019ve been a big girl and talked to them myself, but ask yourself how you would feel if a 15 year old asked your 26 year old self to pitch in more because the gifts were so lopsided. That would not have been well received. I also did not want to have such a vulnerable conversation while i was still processing the fact that my birthday was worth a whopping $3.13. It\u2019s not ALL the parents jobs, but they could\u2019ve smoothed it over and they didn\u2019t, so my teenage butt did what it does best and caused a bit of a scene to get the point across.", "created_utc": 1704182362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wk5fp/aita_for_giving_my_cousins_exactly_what_they_gave/", "score": 1328, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My remark was intentionally rude and I had the intent of embarrassing them, just so I could have satisfaction. It might make me the asshole because my way of looking at the gift was monetarily and materialistically, which is not the way a gift should be received.

But then for them to go in together so that you essentially spend $100 and receive $25 from them?\n\nNo.\n\nWhile I understand that it's not a transaction, no one in their right mind could ever think this was fair, especially since they were given your wish list this year! This is about far more than just the amount of money spent; it's about the thought (or lack thereof) put into your gift vs the effort you put in for them.\n\nWere you being a little petty? Sure.

What kind of gifts have they given you before last year?\n\nBut I have been in situations where I didn't have much cash and I went for something cheap but thoughtful.

Cracked me up for sure.", "NTA\n\nSpending $25 between four people for your birthday and Christmas is just insulting.

Or you spend like a buck a piece to get them each a candycane or something.\n\nGift giving isn't required, certainly not between cousins.

You sold your righteous outrage for too little, imo.", "And this is why I do not like gift cards! They are too impersonable and puts a dollar sign on the gift.

For as long as my sisters and I have been giving gifts at Christmas, we have gone in together 'equally' for gifts for our parents. There are 3 of us sisters but 2 sisters have been married all along. I always thought we should split the cost by 5(equally). They wouldn't so it was split in 3( 2 sets of 2 + me) I never got over this because I had to carry more of the unfair burden. So, I understand this 'splitting' your total gift cost is unfair, and more importantly, I hope you don't carry this hurt and disappointment. I have for my entire adult life(50 years, so far!) and I added it to my list of reasons to have anger towards them since the beginning of our 'equally' share-the-cost decision long ago. They did not respect my single status and agreed to burden me with this additional cost. I don't know if I made the right decision to hold on to it but I don't think so. Unfortunately, the feeling I have towards them for it is as strong today as it was long ago, even as I write this!  Just saying.", "NTA. You're kinda going about it in a long-winded way in your post, however... To you, it's not about the price of the gift. It's the fact that, you  put some much time, effect and money into giving them EACH a gift that was personal from you to them that you thought they'd like, however they just went \"meh, let's all pitch in for 1 Amazon gift Card\" like, that kinda shows they expect nice things from others, but can't be arsed to try and get something nice from themselves. The fact that they did this 2 years in a row, just kinda proves it honestly.\n\nDon't even bother next year. \"I had it in the post for you all, guess it's gotten lost in transit\" and see how they react then. Yeah, you're a A-hole for seeming \"petty\" but that's kinda it. For them to all expect gifts each from a kid, while they can't be bothered to do so themselves as working adults, and have the other family members make a outburst about it when it had nothing to do with them... yeah, just don't bother next time.", "YTA  \n  \nYes, this was a bit petty especially your reaction to their reaction. Honestly as a kid I just would not give anything, that is the rule in our family.  \n  \nI get how you feel, I have several nieces and nephews and I end up spending over $100 for the kids in each family and all I get is a $10 - $15 present from my siblings. And they put 0 thought into it.  \n  \nNext year just don't get them anything and say that your a kid and can't afford it.", "Was it technically petty?Yes.But so was that gift from them,and why do they feel upset when they are in the same position they made you feel upset about?NTA", "ESH - I agree that their gift giving habits are thoughtless and shitty. They suck for that, big time. And yes, what you did was deserved, but I don\u2019t think you went about it in the right way. \n\nThe real hurt here was caused by the lack of thought more than the monetary value of the gift. I\u2019d be willing to bet that if they had given you very thoughtful gifts, even if they weren\u2019t worth $25, you would\u2019ve been way less hurt. But your response focused primarily on the monetary value, which doesn\u2019t send the right message about why you\u2019re upset.\n\nI realize you don\u2019t feel like it would\u2019ve been received well if you had talked to them about being more equitable with gift giving, and if you only focused on wanting more gifts, you\u2019re probably right that the conversation wouldn\u2019t go well. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the actual focus of the conversation. It\u2019s not about wanting more gifts. It\u2019s about how their thoughtlessness made you feel. If you approached it from that angle and made it clear that it wasn\u2019t about materialistic items, but about the thought they didn\u2019t invest in your gift, I think that would\u2019ve been a very different conversation.\n\nI think you also have to be open to the idea that thoughtful gift giving just isn\u2019t something your cousins are interested in at all. My brothers and I give each other \u201cthe gift of nothing\u201d every year. We\u2019re essentially saying, \u201cI\u2019m gonna give you the gift of taking one thing off your to-do list by not expecting a gift from you.\u201d It\u2019s not nearly as fun, but it helps us all out when money is tight and we all appreciate it.", "I don't love this verdict, but reluctantly, ESH.  Yes, it hurts that you put a lot of effort and money into their gifts and they put less into yours, but I think the right thing to do would simply have been to adjust your expectations.  A tedious part of Christmas is establishing a mutual level of gifts with people where you give and get around the same value.  I think the right thing to do would have been to simply get them cheaper items, around the $5-6 range, and move on.  Giving them the exact value of their gift in cash makes you seem a bit too transactional, much as I can understand the temptation.", "So, you didn't think talking to your family wasn't going to go over well but expected your petty gift was going to go over great?\n\nESH. \n\nYou're an asshole for a lot of the way you talk about your cousins. Yes, the gift sucks but the rational, mature thing would have been to match their energy ( a joint gift for them all or gift cards). How's your relationship with them outside of this? A conversation would have worked so well! If they are new families, maybe this helps them with financial stress. They might not have known how it affected you & unfortunately growing up means learning people aren't mind (or emotion) readers. \n\nYou're 15, so you'll get there & we all learn. I recommend not going straight to burning bridges.", "It\u2019s possible that I\u2019m missing some context, but based on the information you\u2019ve given, ESH. \n\nYes, it sucks that your cousins didn\u2019t put more thought or money into your present last year. You say that you are all very close (although I wonder if that\u2019s your interpretation and your much older cousins actually feel differently) and it was hurtful that they didn\u2019t put the same level of effort into your present as you did for theirs. \n\nHowever, your actions were petty and unhelpful. You\u2019ve only provided this one example of your cousins being thoughtless. Given that you obviously cared deeply about your cousins last year, I assume that they have been good to you throughout your life. And you\u2019ve thrown away that relationship with them over one bad gift? \n\nIt\u2019s possible that your cousins thought their gift was going to be on par with yours last year, but miscalculated. It\u2019s possible that they are exceptionally bad gift givers, but show their love in other ways. It\u2019s possible that it was genuinely a thoughtless gift and that if you had spoken to them about it, they would have apologised and made amends. I doubt very much that they calculated in their heads that you are only worth $6.25 to them. \n\nIf you had spoken to them and they were still thoughtless, then I would think differently.

I\u2019m gonna try to reword some of this to make it more clear that this is an AITA and not petty revenge.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve (Teenage F) been close with my two cousins (23 F & 26 F) for as long as I can remember. Our moms are really good about keeping our families close, and they\u2019re the only cousins I ever see because family bonds are not strong on my Dad\u2019s side.\n\nRecently, my two cousins have both gotten engaged and the older one is now married. Their respective fiancee and husband join our families for Christmas. Last year, when Christmas rolled around, I was super excited to shop for gifts for my cousins and their sig others! I picked out thoughtful, $25+ gifts for each of them, spent my own, saved money (I do not have a job because I\u2019m not old enough for most of them yet) and hand wrapped all of their gifts. I was fine with this financial blow because I genuinely enjoy gift giving and I love my cousins and their significant others. When I opened their gift to me, I was kind of shocked. All four of them each pitched in a whopping $6.25 for a $25 amazon gift card as my combined Christmas/birthday gift from all of them. I bit back my surprise, despite being hurt that our relationship was diminished to $6.25 from each of them for my two most important holidays. They all loved each of their thoughtful gifts (keep in mind this was the second year they spent money separate from their parents to give gifts, and I\u2019m already doing it at a MUCH younger age than when they started).\n\nNow, here\u2019s where i\u2019m the asshole. Christmas came by again and I carefully wrapped $6.25 and put it under the tree for each of them. They unwrapped it and shared a glance. My oldest cousin looked at me and laughed as if there was some mistake. \u201cSix dollars and a quarter?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes. I figured it was appropriate and I didn\u2019t want you to go feeling all upstaged like you did last year!\u201d I said while smiling a little too hard. My mother knew of my plan so she expected it but the rest of the family erupted in outrage. I was told by my aunt and uncle that I was disrespectful, cruel, and materialistic. I get what they\u2019re saying and i understand that gift giving is a spirit and not a transaction, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling extremely disappointed that my cousins and their sig others thought their gift to me was appropriate given the time and effort i took with mine (they\u2019re both new families so of course money is on the tighter side, but my cousins came wearing 300 dollar shoes and the newest phones and a ps5 and stanley cups, so I just wish a little bit of that could\u2019ve been directed at me given how close we were). So am I the asshole for humiliating them? My reaction was petty and rude, but was it fitting and deserved?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA\n\n>I was told by my aunt and uncle that I was disrespectful, cruel, and materialistic\n\nSurely this swings both ways and their having any reaction about it when they did the same to you is.....hypocrisy?\n\nAlso sheer cheek of aunt/uncle pitching in on something not even involving them. Sounds like they need the $6.25 treatment also.\n\n>my cousins came wearing 300 dollar shoes and the newest phones and a ps5 and stanley cups\n\n>extremely disappointed that my cousins and their sig others thought their gift to me was appropriate given the time and effort i took with mine\n\nI will hazard here that while it's fair to feel disappointed, you _also_ should accept that any gift-giving celebration like this is often __way__ too over-emphasised and a capitalist and materialist nightmare.\n\nAs such, just because _you_ pour yourself into getting nice gifts _doesn't_ mean you should \"expect\" to get equal back and, sometimes, the front some put on isn't representative of their actual financial situation.\n\nWhat you did is fair, by the by I'd still bear it in mind the purpose and nature of Christmas and of giving gifts __isn't to feel you get equal back, it's _giving_ and not about _receiving_.__\n\nYou don't see Scrooge or other tales being all about how someone gives, doesn't receive and pitches a fit - far too often we see those miserable they got X for Y person and upset they didn't get something in return.....which is, again, not in the spirit of the event at all.\n\nI give gifts of anything from Steam games/gift cards to whatever else to those I know _full well_ likely won't get me something in return due to a number of reasons, including giving to charity and food drives or those in need. Gifts are gifts and given in the knowledge you may not receive anything in return at all.", "No choice, you are not as close as you think you are.\n\n I also get that some things they have are pricier but its on the normal side for adults their age. \n\nThey could still be thoughtful n give u a good gift though.", "NT OP. Your course of action was justified against their initial pettiness.\n\n\nFood for thought, it is easy for some of the folks here to assume the moral highground and say YTA for not acting rationally when the situation may not have happened to them when they were your age.\n\nDon't take the YTA too hardly. You handled this situation pretty well for your age.", "There\u2019s an upside to this- end all expensive giving. Life\u2019s expensive . So next time make the effort and make the something to eat- biscuits , fruit pies, jams, chocolates etc. no one can say you\u2019re mean because you\u2019ve worked hard!, plus you can keep it cheap.

It remember you\u2019re worth three clicks on an Amazon page and 6.25\u2026.And note - there are a lot of people walking around w nice shoes and clothes, who are both assholes and waiting to cash the next paycheck they\u2019ve already spent.", "Op, just don't do gifts.

You seem much more concerned about how great you are and demanding to be treated the same. Well, that\u2019s not how gift giving works. And if you feel hard done by - that\u2019s understandable.

You\u2019re getting upset cause you\u2019re coming out of the childhood stage where people buy you lots of presents for Christmas/birhdays into the adult stage of not getting much at all.

It absolutely sucks that they gave you an amazon gift card of $25 so I get it. But, if you're so close with them, why didn't you talk to them about it at some stage over the course of the entire year? While their gift sucked, it's just petty to wrap up $6.25 for each of them. The partners likely had nothing to do with the gift and left it up to your cousins to sort. You did it to humiliate them in front of everyone, and while I don't agree with the pile on by other family members, you come out of that situation looking childish and petty. Also, while you may love gift giving and thinking about gifts, they may not,and that's not likely to change and it also won't be the last time you come across it. You say your mam sent your aunt a list of gifts worth $25 each, why didn't you send it to your cousins directly?!

That\u2019s entitlement right there. They could have had a massive bill. You said one got engaged? They may have had a a massive deposit to pay. Maybe what they were wearing was second hand or gifted to them, or maybe they saved up prior to Christmas then bought them then ran out of money because something unexpected came up - that\u2019s what happens in the real adult world.

Instead of talking to your cousins about how you felt, you held onto a grudge and harboured resentment for an entire year to enact petty revenge. \n\nYou'll understand this when you're older - adults have a lot of shit going on and sometimes don't have the time or money to spend on thoughtful Christmas presents.

First of all, it never fails to amaze me by when ppl say they should have been gifted something better because the gift giver has money. It is not up to us to dictate how other people spend their money, and they are not obligated to spend it on you. But I would have felt better about it if they gave you a gift of the same value that they had put a little thought into, so I definitely see your point there. But you didn't raise any issues so they had no way of knowing you were unhappy with the gift. Not that you should have complained (never do that, again you are not owed a gift) but maybe another solution would be not just to set a $25 cap and draw names, so that there will be no group gifts. Or you could just not bother to purchase anything. You also don't owe them a gift. If you have to be petty, is it even worth it?", "YTA, responding to assholes. Sorry you got a shitty gift, again.

If it had been just each couple, understandable, but that they were SO CHEAP as to combine all 4 into 1 gift and it was ALSO supposed to be your Birthday gift as well??

However, you sound way more invested in gift giving than your cousins do. I think it makes sense to start a family discussion about ending gift giving to adults, or for you to opt out of giving to your cousins. Stop using what little money you have to give gifts to these people, even though you love them. Maybe get them a nice card or something and mail it.\n\nThe problem with your $6.25 is that you were seething for a year and thought it would shame them a year later.

Better yet, gift them a mug that you made in school.", "I commend you for this, honestly I admire the gumption it took for you to do something like that. I don't know if I could have at 15. what your cousins did really sucked, four grown adults splitting 25 bucks to give as a gift for Christmas AND your birthday? That's messed up, I get not having a lot of money but they could have done something far more thoughtful than that. I can understand why it hurt so much, they clearly didn't put even a little thought into you when you worked so hard on gifts for them. \n\n\nThey deserved the petty and getting cash is not tacky", "I\u2019m torn here on the judgment. You say you and your cousins are close, but they are not giving gifts as if they feel the same way. With such an age difference between you (8-10 years), it\u2019s very possible you feel closer to them than the reverse. They may have resented what could have felt like anything from a chore their parents made them do to babysitting without being paid for it. You, on the other hand, see them as close and may not have noticed or been told of their real feelings. But the difference between your thoughtful gifts and their combined gift card plus combined birthday/Christmas gift shows that they don\u2019t value you in the same way you value them. You mention that they\u2019re in a different phase of life now, and that means they have more independence now in how they choose to spend their time and money. \n\nI know how painful it is to find out someone you care about doesn\u2019t really care about you, especially on a day that\u2019s supposed to be about love and family and all that. I wonder if your mother doesn\u2019t know or realize how your cousins feel and so hasn\u2019t been able to help you navigate this situation, or if she\u2019s trying to spare you the pain in the hopes your cousins come around in time before you realize how they really feel. \n\nTheir parents are definitely AHs for being angry, but it could well be because you showed them just how pointless their enforced family efforts were. Nobody likes the message that their children have been jerks, even when those children are adults. They could also be the type of people who think that family drama is always bad and are always going to be more upset about those who cause it than the actual pain of a family member. Possibly multiple things going on there. \n\nYour cousins and spouses have no right to be upset, but they probably chose that because being angry at someone else is a much more comfortable emotion than being ashamed of one\u2019s own actions. Even for people who are adults, they\u2019re still fairly young adults (I feel so old saying that) so their inability to navigate this situation in the best way is \u2026 understandable if maybe not forgivable. Like, why did they not just say \u201cMoney is tight for us, can we skip the cousin presents?\u201d I wonder if their parents are still trying to force them to maintain their relationship with you, and their Scrooge-giving ways are as much a reaction against their parents as against you. \n\nI don\u2019t think you were wrong to reciprocate their gift-giving efforts. As someone who grew up internalizing the \u201cdon\u2019t make drama even with a catastrophic emotional injury still bleeding all over the living room\u201d message, I think it\u2019s good that you stood up for yourself. Yes, maybe a little petty, but none of the adults in this situation have helped you out in the year since the initial incident happened. That may have been deliberate drama-avoidance or people just being clueless about anybody who isn\u2019t them. \n\nAll that still leaves you hurting in a way no amount of NTAs will fix. When people show you who they are, believe them. Your cousins have shown that they don\u2019t value your relationship, no matter what they or their parents may say. That sucks a lot, and I\u2019m sorry you have to go through this, especially at a time of life when feeling your own worth as a person can be hard. My advice is to lean on the family that is actually there for you, as well as your found family of friends. This may not be the only time in life you find out you\u2019re in an asymmetrical relationship, but hopefully you can learn to navigate the fallout of it in a healthy way. (And setting the boundary of \u201cI\u2019m not going to give people more than they give me\u201d is damn healthy and don\u2019t let anybody tell you otherwise!)", "Esh. The sentiment is all wrong. Just don't both adults gifts again especially as a minor, just your parents is fine.", "ESH\n\nYes, this was an AH move, but due to your relative ages, you are excused in my book.\n\nHowever, did you get the results you hoped for? Do you feel better? I expect not. That's because there are two issues here and your action only adressed the less important one. There's the injustice you feel at not getting an equal gift (both money-wise and in thoughtfulness) and them flouting the rules. You've adressed that here. But more important is your hurt at their actions. They undervalued their relationship with you, making you feel unimportant, and that hurts. Your retaliation didn't adress that, it only made the damage bigger and noticable to the whole family. If you want to repair your relationship, you really do need to talk with them as others have suggested.", "Info: Do you think this plan will help the situation next year or make it worse?

I could understand you pooling your money with your parents for the gifts since you aren't even old enough to work yet, but all your adult cousins doing that for a 25$ gift for you? Really? And then not even one out of the four can be bothered to put some effort into it, the best they can come up with is a gift card, 2 years in a row, even though you gave them a wish list with plenty of options in that price range? I think your gifts were a perfect way to call them out on their bullshit.\n\nThough next year just pool your money with your parents when giving gifts to your cousins, just like how they are doing it for your gift. There's no point in putting in effort to give them thoughtful gifts when they clearly don't care to put in any effort themselves. Just give thoughtful gifts to those who do the same for you and leave it at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do notice that I overlooked one thing, the 20-30 bucks per gift is the budget for the Christmas gifts and for you they are doing a combined Christmas/birthday gift without increasing the budget for your gifts? A combined gift should also combine the budget of both, not use a budget of $0 for your birthday, combine it with the $20-30 budget for Christmas and then call it a combined gift.\n\nThey haven't given you $3.13 for your birthday and $3.13 for Christmas because that would put them way under the agreed upon Christmas budget!\n\nEffectively they've given you nothing for your birthday two years in a row while using Christmas as the excuse and that's supposed to be close family of yours? Is that a joke? Your Aunt and Uncle called you disrespectful and materialistic, but what should we call this that their own children are doing? Yeah, exactly that.\n\nIf you are giving them any birthday presents then stop doing so. It's also clearly time to ask why they aren't keeping to the agreed upon Christmas budget, or why they aren't giving you anything for your birthday, because either of those is clearly the case and it looks like it's being ignored completely.", "NTA But i also want to have a moan that i spent \u00a350 each on my sister and her husband and got an \u00a38 bottle of wine, probably from their cupboard as a combined gift from both of them in return.", "NTA.

You're smart and kind.", "I think that giving each of them those GCs was petty, dickish, but well-deserved. I have to NTA because the post (I'm reading after the 3rd edit) is thoughtful, sympathetic, and it's never fair to expect teenagers to act like mature, reasoned adults. *(I do think it would have been healthier for your mom to step in before this happened so maybe your mom is a bit T A.)*\n\nIt sounds like your aunt's side has the ones who are immature and materialistic.\n\nThe way I read this is that it's not about the money.\n\nIt's about the pure lack of thought put into the gift. \n\nWho do you buy a $25 amazon GC for? A person you don't know well. A person who isn't that important to you. It's a gift for the office pool, secret Santa, or holiday contest. It's a gift for the generic *anybody*.\n\nIt's not a thoughtful gift for a close relative.\n\nWhy does your aunt go through the pretense of asking for your wish list if your cousins are only going to go in on the very bottom value GC anyway? Does she not share your list with your cousins?\n\nI think an error made on your side, but not your fault, is that this wasn't dealt with last year. Instead it festered for a year which made the hurt worse. \n\nThe attempt to craft a certain wish list was too passive and your mother should have pushed the issue with aunt when sharing it if she couldn't raise the issue earlier (earlier would have been better.)\n\nThe angle here: you are a young teen and feel close to your older adult cousins. It would be natural to look up to them, admire their style, and hope for them to gift you thoughtfully, with something physical picked out for you which you would not have bought on your own. Something they put their adult woman experience into to pick out something nice and impressive to a younger girl. Something that they perhaps wish they had been given to them in their mid-teens. Something that makes you feel *seen, understood, and appreciated* by them. ... also something which acknowledges the awkwardness of rolling a birthday together with our mega-consumerism holiday.\n\n\"*It's the thought that counts*\" actually means something. It means that not every junky thoughtless gift matters. It means that the cost of a gift isn't what matters, it's the intention and effort put into giving it.\n\nI get the sense that you'd be happy to receive something thoughtfully picked out, even if it was a gift they both went in on and wasn't very expensive. \n\nThere may be some judgyness edging on envy in your post but that's normal for a human, particularly a teenager. If you're being asked to consider their 'new family' finances, it's natural to evaluate if the evidence is present to support that.\n\nDon't feel guilty for wanting their kind thoughtfulness.\n\nHow you approach this depends on the individual relationships involved. \n\nMaybe you could write a heartfelt letter between now and the next Christmas, expressing how you admire them and was upset when they put no effort or time into their shared, double impact gift to you. Let them know that it's not about money as much as it is that you would appreciate something you can be surprised by and possibly cherish. \n\nMaybe it is too much to ask you to state these things plainly; being vulnerable is hard to everyone who's hit puberty. Becoming vulnerable to those who've hurt you is even harder. \n\nMaybe this message needs to flow through your mom. Maybe she shares them with your aunt and, if she comes to understand them, you can talk to her with your mom. Then your aunt could talk to her kids. If your aunt is just a block and shrugging this off, then maybe your mom could talk to your cousins directly and share why you have felt upset and neglected. If your cousins either don't care or have chosen to just focus on their new family lives, it may be time to let go of them and let your relationship to gradually cool. \n\nIt's painful and hard when people you love don't seem to think much of you in return, or when close relations (and friends) pull away when their lives change. \n\nYour life will change, too, sooner than you expect. You're still at the age where nothing can come fast enough but you'll soon be off on your own life and hopefully making new relationships with people you've chosen who will think of you kindly and thoughtfully gift you.\n\nDon't be afraid to become a bit vulnerable and explain to them if they don't understand! Some people see gifts as physically transactional: about the cost or the status. \n\nSome people need to be taught about the emotional side of gifting. \n\nIt's not always about buying a thing, or even buying at all, or subbing money instead of a gift. It can be a thrifted gift, if thoughtfully chosen. It can be a crafted gift, made with hours spent thinking of you. It can be an event planned around you: a favorite dinner, show, or special day.\n\nIf your aunt and cousins are viewing gifts as purely a physical transaction but what you really, really want is their attention, work out with your mom how you can express it and how your mom can support you with it.", "NTA, but next year get them items from the dollar store and don't think about it again.

The other examples of use a $5 Starbucks or w/e gift card are better ways to do it. Also you\u2019re 15 years old and you could have also told your cousins that life hit you hard this year so here are some nicely written Xmas cards instead.

It would have stayed amongst your generation. They as your older cousin could have also just said hey look we\u2019re bad at this and how about we skip gift giving these year and relieved all of you guys of the expectations. You needed to put this back on the adults in your family and let them figuring it out with you because if not you end up making 15-year-old petty decisions. Also mother of the year - your mom knew didn\u2019t dissuade you or help talk you through your process or give her sister or your cousins a heads up but just let it happen.

Why should OP continue to expend more effort on them than they're willing to take for her?\n\nBecause look, I have a friend who I haven't seen in years. I still count her a good friend, but our Christmas presents have become very lopsided. I have a lot less money coming into my household than she does, but in the last few years have been giving her presents that match my other good friends (budget of \u00a325) while recieving generic stuff that clearly cost less than a tenner in return. This year she gave me a bookmark. Worse yet? It's the same bookmark she gave me last year, and I'm thinking that's a sign. So next year will probably be just a card and a box of biscuits/other snacks for the family to share, rather than trying to give her something personal. That's not spite but pragmatism. She evidently doesn't feel we're close friends any more, and I don't want to be pushy because the way she feels is completely valid.", "They did the same thing this year as well tho.", "She would have done it sooner if the next Christmas was only a week away from the last one, unfortunately it was exactly 365 days later\n\nNTA", "They didn\u2019t botch it, they just didn\u2019t give enough fucks to place an amazon order a week before christmas for an actual thing i wanted.

With the gift card, it could be for any amount, so the slight wouldn\u2019t be as obvious at the time, but rather a \u201cbite them in the ass\u201d thing later.", "For me - a gift card is better.

It's not fair OP is gifting each adult couple but they're too lazy or cheap to reciprocate.", "Where does she say that in her post?", "I think you did the right thing. It didn't fit the formalities and it made them feel uncomfortable--but they made YOU feel uncomfortable by being cheapskates who can't even spend 2 minutes picking something off your wishlist after you did more emotional labor for them to make it easy to give an actual gift you will appreciate.

It really seems like you were a last thought, and the four of them pooling their money for $25 is pretty pathetic. I understand why that upset you.\n\nYou were petty, and your mother is right that you will likely deal with the consequences on your own.

Yes, you're absolutely 100 percent without a doubt the a-hole. No where did I say give a random gift on a random day. I suggested it would have been less of an asshole move to simply give a token gift for Christmas. Look, you calculated down to the penny the gift you were giving them. That in and if itself is a pretty dick move. You were clearly sending a message. That makes you an asshole. Have a nice night.
