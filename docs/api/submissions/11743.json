He used to be married to P but divorced 4yrs ago. Recently he's been complaining about his wrist pain in his left arm, so he's been using his right arm a lot and it's starting to ache, so yesterday he asked me to take him to the hospital, I absolutely refused, I told him I'd drop him in the hospital and pick him up in 3hrs but I'm not staying with him. Reason is that, a few months ago, he had some kind of insect bite, I told him to go to hospital but he kept postponing and doing things he read online like icing and whatnot.&#10;  \n\n A few days later it got inflamed and started getting black, then he freaked out called me at work and made me come and take him to hospital, I did, but when we are at the hospital, he didn't talk AT ALL. Like he wouldn't say his own name or age and kept looking at me for each question expecting me to answer for him. I told him to ask the doctor all of his question but he kept looking down and I had to do everything. It was humiliating, later I had to struggle with the insurance too because he got too stressed and kept falling asleep in the hospital lounge while I was sorting out everything. So this time I absolutely refused to go, he was pouting all day yesterday and today called his ex wife 'B' to ask her take him to the hospital, she refused and texted me saying tag. I asked her what she meant and she said he's like that and his dad coddles him so much and F expects it from everybody. He'd get even worse if he gets sick with flu or something, it's one of the main reason they divorced, apparently B had a ovarian cyst ruptured and she was hospitalized but F tried to make her sleep in the couch so that he could sleep in the bed as he had a very bad cold. She told me it's my life but she suggests I put a strict boundry with F. Now F is accusing me of listening to his ex and punishing him for being sick. And that I'm unsupportive and an asshole who knows how much pain he's in but refuses to do something about it. I know he's in pain and I'm beginning to doubt if I am the asshole.", "created_utc": 1678213850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l759f/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_bf_to_the_hospital/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Set all the boundaries you like but if he was like this with his ex and he has already atleast once successfully done it to you and don\u2019t see a problem with it\u2026I would say that you\u2019re too late for boundaries. You need to figure out if this is something you want to deal with or not. If not, kick him out now. Like today. Drop him off at the hospital with all his stuff.", "NTA. Your boyfriend sounds like a one-man Soviet parade, given how many red flags he's waving. Proceed carefully and listen to the advice you've been given. The decision is yours, of course, but you have all the information you need to make it right.", "NTA\n\nRUN. Run very far very fast! He can take his damn self to the hospital. You aren\u2019t responsible for that! Also him making you answer all the question and deal with the insurance sounds a lot like weaponized incompetence. Followed by manipulation and abuse when they don\u2019t get what they want.

You set boundaries and that\u2019s fine.\n\nI am sure if it was something serious or life threatening you would go.\n\nThe red flag is him texting his ex like that, it\u2019s not normal.", "NTA - I think it is time to tag out of this relationship.", "you're nta at all here honestly. tell him to put on his big boy pants or call his dad every time he wants to go to the doctor. i understand being anxious about doctors visits and stuff even as an adult, but the time to learn and grow out of that was when he moved out of his parent's house (if not before)", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult, he needs to handle his own medical care.\n\nAlso, pain in his wrist and arm sounds like carpal tunnel or a pinched nerve. What exactly does he expect the hospital to do for that? That's not a sickness, that's an injury which should be handled by going through his primary care physician and getting a referral to physical therapy or their hand & wrist clinic. The emergency room or urgent care isn't going to do that.", "NTA - so far from your personal experience and hearing from his ex, F appears to be acting like an immature little boy. I would have a serious conversation about his behaviour and also seek information about his behaviour from other people who know him well, like friends and family. The whole idea of moving in together is to see how things work out between the couple, if they are compatible or not. If things don\u2019t work out, oh well, move on. It\u2019s good to actually discover the flaws before things get worse.", "I kind of want you to be petty and go and then when the doctors start asking questions and he sheepishly looks over to you, to loudly announce for everyone to hear \"Sorry my widdle baby hurt his arm. Would my widdle baby like a bottle?\" and embarrass him right back. \n\nAll jokes aside, you need to sit him down and let him know that you do not plan to coddle him. You are willing to be supportive and hold a hand if needed but he is grown enough to deal with his own insurance and talk to a doctor. You are his girlfriend, not his mother. If he cant accept that, then you need to decide if he is worth mothering. If hes not, then get out out of that relationship.", "Count your blessings.

NTA and run!!!!", "NTA - asking for support is one thing but flat out refusing to help yourself when it's not forthcoming is quite another, and it's worse still if you demand support when it's not really needed.\n\nHe's well old enough to be able to take care of himself and function as a grown human in spite of not being physically 100% in perfect condition right now.\n\nIf his dad has raised him to be this dependent then he can call his dad to take care of him now.", "NTA, stick to your guns. Or run, running sounds better.", "NTA. Time for your bf to put on his big boy pants and be an adult. Not your job to manage his medical interactions. \n\nAlso for the record, he's a huge AH. Ovarian cysts are incredibly painful when they rupture. A bad cold does **not** compare.", "NTA. He will pout until you coddle him as he expects. You need to set firm boundaries. Having a grown-ass man have his GF speak for him is a too much.", "32 should not need someone to go to the doctor with them for a sore arm. And this is a doctor thing not an ER thing.

If you do nothing this is not magically going to get better.", "NTA\n\nThe ex has experience in this area, you should probably listen.\n\nIf the BF can drive himself and take care of himself, he can take himself to the hospital. Otherwise, he can ask his dad to take him.", "NTA. Seriously he\u2019s an adult. It\u2019s time to learn to take care of himself. But to me this reeks of red flags...over and over and over. You don\u2019t do what he said and he calls his ex? Lack of boundaries. You don\u2019t do what he says and he tries to run back to her!!! You\u2019re lucky SHE has boundaries. She\u2019s telling you that they got divorced bc he lack boundaries and never grew up. Run. Run. Run.", "Oh my, where do I begin.  NTA for starters as you are not his mom.  The significant red flags are definitely something to be warned about.  I hope things work out for you two.", "NTA he's your BF not your 32 year old child. What a joke.", "This is kind of confusing, but it sounds like bf is a big baby who can't take care of himself. NTA.", "Its wrist pain. He should go to his primary care physician not a hospital. And he should make those appointments himself.\nNta", "Girl. WTF are you doing? This one is *clearly* not done cooking yet, put him back!", "INFO: Why does he need to go to the hospital and not make an appointment with his GP to start? Emergency rooms can have wicked wait times, and often they have more expensive copays (I\u2019m in the US). More importantly, though, has he ever had his mental health properly evaluated?\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards E S H because I am worried there is a major underlying issue that has been overlooked (not just by the husband but by everyone around him). I recently learned about selective mutism with autism, and I didn\u2019t know that could happen. From what I\u2019ve read, he\u2019s struggling. I may be missing pieces of the puzzle. He may also have a history of medical trauma and may therefore have extreme, debilitating anxiety. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I have enough information to fairly judge the situation. I am empathetic towards OP\u2019s frustration and agree a solution is definitely needed. I just don\u2019t think abandoning him completely is the helpful thing here. I could be wrong, though.\n\nEdit: I want to make it clear that I *do* think he was an AH for how he dealt with his ex\u2019s ovarian cyst. That\u2019s horrible, and I could understand the divorce. I\u2019m not excusing his behavior. I just wonder if an undiagnosed mental health (or other) thing is at play here. Maybe it\u2019s not, in which case I would have a different opinion.", "NTA. His ex warned you, I would listen. He\u2019s the one that\u2019s preventing himself from getting care. He needs to grow up and go to the hospital himself.", "ESH. After the first hospital visit, you guys should have communicated. You should have told F what about his behavior was unacceptable to you and F could communicate his feelings about the ordeal. After communicating your feelings, you two should have come up with a compromise/plan. \"If we have to go to the hospital again, this is what will happen...\" and the plan should meet both you and F's needs. Why wait until he needs to go to the hospital again to address this issue? Just refusing to take him isn't the answer, just like him just expecting you to handle everything isn't the answer. Communicate. It sounds like you guys aren't compatible.", "NTA but this whole situation is weird. You flat out refused without saying \u201cI am willing to go with you if you take more control of the situation yourself this time and we don\u2019t repeat last time\u201d and *before* you spoke with his ex wife? AND when you refused he asked his ex wife to take him. AND when she refused she texted you to talk about it? All of that is weird behavior from all parties involved to various degrees. \n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to not want to have to baby your partner when he is sick. It\u2019s great to set a boundary about something you don\u2019t want to do again if your parent has a habit of needing to be coddled when sick. But I think this could have been a more productive situation for everyone involved if you\u2019d had a conversation with him after the first time to set some ground rules, even if those rules are \u201cI\u2019ll only pick you up and drop you off\u201d so this whole weird triangle didn\u2019t need to occur.", "ESH - your boyfriend sounds like a lot of work, but you saying I'm not going to go to the hospital with you is a bit much. You're both making this a way bigger deal than it needs to be and holding grudges from things that have happened in the past. There seems to be very little trust between you two if the ex can get involved like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While I think he should approach it with more maturity, I feel like it's immature to refuse to take him unless you had to go to work or another pressing commitment that can't be missed.", "He says his wrist is in too much pain to drive, but he's also still playing video games for hours at a time. He's not in some crazy amount of pain; he just wants the attention. And OP says that she's willing to take him to the ER, just not stay there with him (after what happened last time).", "Like I said - I agree that his behavior is dramatic and obnoxious."]}
