Brother knows about this because it landed me in the hospital when we were younger. Now I normally don't do this at all but with Thanksgiving being a holiday specifically about overindulgence on food and that being something that I'm weird about, my therapist thought it would be fine if I weighed out a serving size of everything I wanted to eat there. \n\n\nNow normally I'd just ask Brother and he probably wouldn't care though he might ask to do it instead so I don't backside and that would be fine. The problem is, SIL keeps ragging on me for \"running to my brother crying everytime I scrape my knee\". Which I don't believe is true. Lately she's been going on about how, as the woman of the house, all Thanksgiving requests have to go through her. \n\n\nOkay sure, whatever, so a few days before Thanksgiving I ask her if I can pre-portion or weigh my food (the stuff that finishes before most of the guests come over) prior to the guests and set a plate aside. I specifically mentioned that I would come over early to do this and even offered, If she wanted, to help with setting the table/any last second cooking, I also may have mentioned that my brother would be fine with it as well. \n\n\nWell she blew up on me and made several comments about me not respecting her and how I'm too close to my brother and that I need to \"grow the fuck up and stop acting like a child just because you look like one.\"\n\n\nOkay, whatever, I guess. I stayed cool during this, but regardless I ended up telling her, that it's fine if she doesn't want to let me portion a plate with my foodscale beforehand, I just won't eat. \n\n\nWell that pissed her off even more and she made a couple of other comments regarding how I'm a leech on my brother/my family (I make almost as much as my brother and live in my own house?) And that I tried to steal her thunder this year by offering to host Thanksgiving when I \"don't even eat\" \ud83d\ude43. And implying that my S.O was only with me because I looked like a child. That finally pissed me off enough to snap back at her that even if I looked like a child, I'd rather look like that then the Pillsbury dough boy.  Now admittedly I do know she's sensitive about her weight and she used to ask me for dieting tips before my brother explained to her to *not* do that and what I said is a low blow.\n\n\nAnyway AITA?", "created_utc": 1669216710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2rra8/aita_for_requesting_a_special_plate_at/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would take your food scale in your purse and when the food gets served bring it out and say \"DOCTORS ORDERS !\" smile nice and begin to weigh your portions. No Drama no discussion, just do it. she would have to fight you in front of everyone and i bet \"fluffy\" won't do that.", "NTA - This woman is a whole bunch of red flags. As Thanksgiving is going to be difficult and possibly triggering for you, I wouldn't advise that you trust her to be around you at Thanksgiving, which means I'd suggest you avoid spending Thanksgiving at their house. If you tell your brother why you've made this decision beforehand, his wife might well cause a load of drama, so I suggest you wait until afterwards, invite him over for coffee, and then show him your post and explain that you want to spend time with him, but that his wife is a risk to your health. Maybe the two of you can make a plan to carve out protected \"sibling time\" with each other, find some fun things to do together regularly, and maybe that'll either make his wife less weird, or cause her to do send up a red flag your brother will notice.", "My gosh.

It may be that she is so resentful because she is speaking on his behalf- expressing a sentiment that he cannot express to you because he loves you. It also may be that she has some serious jealous/protectiveness issues to work through, and he needs to check her in how she navigates around you.\n\nI think maybe ESH. But either way, I think you need to have a serious talk with your brother, because the way you talk to her and especially the way she talks to you sounds very nasty and unproductive.\n\nN T A for the portioning thing. That was therapist recommended and a reasonable request that you offered to assist in accommodating. Do what you need to do to stay healthy. Please don\u2019t let this trigger you into not eating for that meal- that WILL worry your brother and family, and it will villanize her. Talk to your brother about it. You are asking for reasonable accommodation for a mental health disorder / issue.

You shouldn't have to go through your sister-in-law about a request. It doesn't matter who is or isn't cooking the food. Good luck with your recovery and Thanksgiving.", "ESH but you more than your SIL because you started it. A big dinner for a lot of people has a lot of moving parts & getting everything on the table at the same time at the right temperature is complicated. It doesn\u2019t help to have another person on the kitchen pulling food out of each dish to set up a plate ahead of time. There are some dishes that that would definitely spoil the look of. Are you going to cut a piece out of the pumpkin pie, too? My main point, however, is that if you\u2019ve been weighing your food for 2 years or 4 years, you shouldn\u2019t have to weigh it every time. You know how big 2 ounces (or whatever your portion is) of turkey is; take a piece that size. You should be able to look at a serving spoon & know how many spoons worth of potatoes or beans or whatever you can take. I did weight watchers for years & it\u2019s definitely something you learn.", "NTA.. but I hope your lonely Thanksgiving goes well, because I doubt she'll want you over now.", "ESH you a bit less than SIL.  \n\nReading this story I get a picture that SIL may eat more than is strictly healthy and you a bit less.  That sounds like absolute hell for each of you.  The same way you might get triggered, I wonder if SIL is being triggered.\n\nNeither of you handled it well.  Instead of dealing with the issue (food management) both of you took it personal.  A stressful holiday like Thanksgiving (or Christmas) is not the time to work these issues out.  But I do think some respectful conversation is appropriate when life has calmed down to improve this relationship.", "NTA - you have an ED. You keep saying that you're \"weird\" with food, but it's an ED. Does your SIL understand this? It doesn't seem like she does and is just building up resentment because she doesn't understand that an ED is a mental health issue and not just a quirk that you have. I think to further avoid this, and maybe explain why you rely on your brother so much, you and your brother should sit down with her and explain exactly what's wrong and why what she's saying is harmful and abusive. I'm not excusing her. Your SIL is mean and rude, and what she implied was uncalled for and could be harmful to recovery. But sometimes, even if someone technically \"knows\" what happened or what you have, they don't actually understand what it means or what it entails. (Example: Think of people who know what depression is but assumes that it just means you're sad and negative all time. They know what it means, but they don't really understand what happens to your mind and body when you're in an episode of depression.)", "NTA. If she can dish (heh) it, she can take it.\n\nAlso, even ignoring that she started it and is also systemically hostile to you and your relationship with your brother (jealous and toxic much?), being a dick to someone over their ED is orders of magnitude worse than insulting their vanity.\n\nFrom where I stand, you were *kind* to her. If it'd been me, I don't know if shed ever dare speak one word at me again.", "Esh", "NTA. If I understand this correctly, you're not asking for special food.  You are asking for special portions. Why the heck would this be such a problem for your SIL is beyond me. You are being considerate in trying to address this issue early - you know she would have made a huge scene if you waited until Thanksgiving day.   \n\nSIL sounds like she has issues - not you.  You and your brother are dealing with your medical condition in a responsible manner.  Why the heck should SIL care if you prepare your portions and prepare your own plate early???\n\nMaybe SIL is jealous of you as a person and jealous of the relationship you have with your brother.  There is no reason for her to be so miserable about this, and then to start slinging disrespectful comments about your relationship with your BF?  \n\nSomething else is going on...

It\u2019s fine to say, for example, \u201ceat 6 ounces of meat a day\u201d, but most people have no idea how much that is without weighing it.

If this disrespects you then you need to get your priorities straight.", "Definitely agreed that SIL is being very inappropriate, and as mentioned word-for-word my comment, SIL is noted to have commented on OP\u2019s appearance several times.\n\nSo while OP throwing an insult is reasonable given the context, it\u2019s still not healthy or a mature or productive use of time on both parts to be resorting to insulting one another\u2019s appearance.\n\nI don\u2019t think OP is the AH, but it sounds like both are possibly mishandling one another. It\u2019s not in what OP writes that she literally says, but in how OP writes about SIL.\n\nI just feel like there is some info missing and this is a situation where Brother needs to step in and speak for himself within his relationships, rather than have his wife and sister both speaking in his behalf and arguing on it to boot.\n\nEdit to add: my perspective is as a 27y/o younger sister who\u2019s BIL and SIL both had minor issue with me for similar reasons, until my actual older siblings found their own ways to set boundaries with me and ask me to be more responsible for myself. So definitely a biased perspective\u2026 I am the youngest and my siblings have all be so so so supportive of me throughout my life. My 20s has including me making active efforts to reforming those relationships with my siblings, so that it\u2019s a little more give and take. Could be some similar goings on\u2019s here. SIL is definitely handling horribly if so, though.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

SIL opened the door by insulting OP. I began recovery from my compulsive overeating 5 years ago and was actually thin-shamed by some obese co-workers because of my success. It's been my experience that losing weight and not gaining it back is a violation of some unwritten code among people who struggle with their weight.", ">I can occasionally eat them in a safe space, I still can't eat them in public at all.\n\nI'm just the opposite. I can eat the occasional sugar-free dessert in public if it is dished out for me but can't keep it in the house because I couldn't stay away from it. EDs are the worst!", "> However with the amount of food being served, it's causing some of my negative thoughts to spiral. Weighing out food for this specific instance grants a means of control to me and allows me to tell my brain to STFU when the thoughts are overwhelming.\n\nThis is an ED. Your therapist is enabling you for some reason. My guess would be fatphobia, but ultimately, you need help to deal with these types of thoughts.", "Good for you for taking care of yourself.  Please don't let your self-care slip in an effort to make other people happy.", "Oh no, absolutely, and a while ago I absolutely would take it as a means to decrease the amount I was eating. It's taken me a *long* time to realize and accept the fact that a serving size is exactly that, a *serving* size it's what a serving *should* be and the fact that my brain gremlin tries to convince me that it is too much is not true. I don't weigh my food every meal anymore it's more so that this was causing me so much stress and anxiety that weighing out a serving size is the way I soothe the brain gremlins shitty thoughts over the the massive amount of food that will be present. Else I will swing the other way and eat far too little.\n\n\nTL:DR I've finally been able to convince myself a serving size is okay and fine to eat and knowing this, and weighing out a portion is a way to combat the negative brain gremlin thoughts that say I simply shouldn't eat."]}
