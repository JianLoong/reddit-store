Brother knows about this because it landed me in the hospital when we were younger. Now I normally don't do this at all but with Thanksgiving being a holiday specifically about overindulgence on food and that being something that I'm weird about, my therapist thought it would be fine if I weighed out a serving size of everything I wanted to eat there. \n\n\nNow normally I'd just ask Brother and he probably wouldn't care though he might ask to do it instead so I don't backside and that would be fine. The problem is, SIL keeps ragging on me for \"running to my brother crying everytime I scrape my knee\". Which I don't believe is true. Lately she's been going on about how, as the woman of the house, all Thanksgiving requests have to go through her. \n\n\nOkay sure, whatever, so a few days before Thanksgiving I ask her if I can pre-portion or weigh my food (the stuff that finishes before most of the guests come over) prior to the guests and set a plate aside. I specifically mentioned that I would come over early to do this and even offered, If she wanted, to help with setting the table/any last second cooking, I also may have mentioned that my brother would be fine with it as well. \n\n\nWell she blew up on me and made several comments about me not respecting her and how I'm too close to my brother and that I need to \"grow the fuck up and stop acting like a child just because you look like one.\"\n\n\nOkay, whatever, I guess. I stayed cool during this, but regardless I ended up telling her, that it's fine if she doesn't want to let me portion a plate with my foodscale beforehand, I just won't eat. \n\n\nWell that pissed her off even more and she made a couple of other comments regarding how I'm a leech on my brother/my family (I make almost as much as my brother and live in my own house?) And that I tried to steal her thunder this year by offering to host Thanksgiving when I \"don't even eat\" \ud83d\ude43. And implying that my S.O was only with me because I looked like a child. That finally pissed me off enough to snap back at her that even if I looked like a child, I'd rather look like that then the Pillsbury dough boy.  Now admittedly I do know she's sensitive about her weight and she used to ask me for dieting tips before my brother explained to her to *not* do that and what I said is a low blow.\n\n\nAnyway AITA?", "created_utc": 1669216710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2rra8/aita_for_requesting_a_special_plate_at/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I think you should not go to Thanksgiving at your brother\u2019s this year.  It\u2019s just going to be a chilly, stressful time for you.  Make your own meal, or order takeout.  Invite friends who have no nearby family.  Have a better time.", "NTA  sounds like you are recovering Edo. Don't go. She's gonna make it hard for you", "NTA but your SIL sure is. There\u2019s nothing wrong with portioning your food, especially when you\u2019ve been guided by a doctor. And you didn\u2019t even ask SIL to weight the food for you, you said you\u2019d do if.

SIL fucked around and found out, \ngood on you for standing your ground. SIL being sketchy about you being close to your sibling is giving me a very weird jealousy vibe. \n\nI hope you\u2019re doing extraordinary, op!\nand I hope your holidays are well!", "NTA\n\nYou asked nicely and even offered to forgo eating if it was too much of a hassle...

Reading between the lines, I'm guessing she hasn't been fully informed.\n\nEither way, NTA.  The info would just clarify the level of her awfulness.", "NTA, your SIL sounds like a bully. Bring your own plate of food and when anyone comments, be sure to tell them your SIL would not accommodate your request to be allowed to measure for portion control.", "ESH, it really sounds like there is more going on here and this was the straw, she didn\u2019t handle it well though.", "I think you know it was a dick move to comment about her weight. \n\nHowever NTA because you\u2019re SIL is ridiculous. Sounds like there\u2019s a lot more going on here than just TDay. She sounds jealous of your relationship with your brother. Like that she\u2019s competing with you or something. She spat out a lot of BS totally unrelated to the question at hand.", "nta your sil is awful for saying the things she said to you. i myself am overweight and i think its fine that you called her the Pillsbury doughboy cause she deserves everybit of that. how dare her be mean to someone with such a serious disorder. she is jealous of your size and i guess the fact that she has the opposite problem with food. I would take your food scale in your purse and when the food gets served bring it out and say \"DOCTORS ORDERS !\" smile nice and begin to weigh your portions. No Drama no discussion, just do it. she would have to fight you in front of everyone and i bet \"fluffy\" won't do that.", "NTA - This woman is a whole bunch of red flags. As Thanksgiving is going to be difficult and possibly triggering for you, I wouldn't advise that you trust her to be around you at Thanksgiving, which means I'd suggest you avoid spending Thanksgiving at their house. If you tell your brother why you've made this decision beforehand, his wife might well cause a load of drama, so I suggest you wait until afterwards, invite him over for coffee, and then show him your post and explain that you want to spend time with him, but that his wife is a risk to your health. Maybe the two of you can make a plan to carve out protected \"sibling time\" with each other, find some fun things to do together regularly, and maybe that'll either make his wife less weird, or cause her to do send up a red flag your brother will notice.", "My gosh. I\u2019m not sure. You sound exhausting. I can understand her frustration.", "ESH - I don\u2019t think your request was unreasonable in the circumstances but I think you, of all people, know that weight should not be the subject of ridicule.", "I think you know it was an AH move to comment on someone\u2019s weight/appearance\u2026 So, for that - it can easily be said that yes your are an AH.\n\nHowever, it seems that she commented on your appearance several times and it seems she has some bitterness about your relationship with your brother that is between her and him, not her and you. \n\nI think this is a scenario where your brother needs to take ownership over his two relationships with two people he loves and mediate. It may be that she is so resentful because she is speaking on his behalf- expressing a sentiment that he cannot express to you because he loves you. It also may be that she has some serious jealous/protectiveness issues to work through, and he needs to check her in how she navigates around you.\n\nI think maybe ESH. But either way, I think you need to have a serious talk with your brother, because the way you talk to her and especially the way she talks to you sounds very nasty and unproductive.\n\nN T A for the portioning thing. That was therapist recommended and a reasonable request that you offered to assist in accommodating. Do what you need to do to stay healthy. Please don\u2019t let this trigger you into not eating for that meal- that WILL worry your brother and family, and it will villanize her. Talk to your brother about it. You are asking for reasonable accommodation for a mental health disorder / issue. You should be allowed to make that happen for yourself in a family setting.", "Not to second guess your therapist, but isn't weighing a portion size kind of similar to disordered eating? It's over-focusing on the food. Is it because the holidays are too stressful for working on the disorder? That said, you're \n\nNTA", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH. Your sister in law shouldn\u2019t have been such a problem, but I feel like continuing to weigh your food is still disordered eating. And the fact that your therapist is recommending this is also not okay.", "if it's really between weighing portions of food and not eating at all, you need to find a new therapist. whatever they're doing is not working for you.", "NTA.  \n\n\n Your sister-in-law sounds like an insensitive dick. You shouldn't have to go through your sister-in-law about a request. It doesn't matter who is or isn't cooking the food. Good luck with your recovery and Thanksgiving.", "ESH but you more than your SIL because you started it. A big dinner for a lot of people has a lot of moving parts & getting everything on the table at the same time at the right temperature is complicated. It doesn\u2019t help to have another person on the kitchen pulling food out of each dish to set up a plate ahead of time. There are some dishes that that would definitely spoil the look of. Are you going to cut a piece out of the pumpkin pie, too? My main point, however, is that if you\u2019ve been weighing your food for 2 years or 4 years, you shouldn\u2019t have to weigh it every time. You know how big 2 ounces (or whatever your portion is) of turkey is; take a piece that size. You should be able to look at a serving spoon & know how many spoons worth of potatoes or beans or whatever you can take. I did weight watchers for years & it\u2019s definitely something you learn.", "NTA.. but I hope your lonely Thanksgiving goes well, because I doubt she'll want you over now.", "ESH you a bit less than SIL.  \n\nReading this story I get a picture that SIL may eat more than is strictly healthy and you a bit less.  That sounds like absolute hell for each of you.  The same way you might get triggered, I wonder if SIL is being triggered.\n\nNeither of you handled it well.  Instead of dealing with the issue (food management) both of you took it personal.  A stressful holiday like Thanksgiving (or Christmas) is not the time to work these issues out.  But I do think some respectful conversation is appropriate when life has calmed down to improve this relationship.", "NTA - you have an ED. You keep saying that you're \"weird\" with food, but it's an ED. Does your SIL understand this? It doesn't seem like she does and is just building up resentment because she doesn't understand that an ED is a mental health issue and not just a quirk that you have. I think to further avoid this, and maybe explain why you rely on your brother so much, you and your brother should sit down with her and explain exactly what's wrong and why what she's saying is harmful and abusive. I'm not excusing her. Your SIL is mean and rude, and what she implied was uncalled for and could be harmful to recovery. But sometimes, even if someone technically \"knows\" what happened or what you have, they don't actually understand what it means or what it entails. (Example: Think of people who know what depression is but assumes that it just means you're sad and negative all time. They know what it means, but they don't really understand what happens to your mind and body when you're in an episode of depression.)", "NTA. If she can dish (heh) it, she can take it.\n\nAlso, even ignoring that she started it and is also systemically hostile to you and your relationship with your brother (jealous and toxic much?), being a dick to someone over their ED is orders of magnitude worse than insulting their vanity.\n\nFrom where I stand, you were *kind* to her. If it'd been me, I don't know if shed ever dare speak one word at me again.", "Esh", "NTA. If I understand this correctly, you're not asking for special food.  You are asking for special portions. Why the heck would this be such a problem for your SIL is beyond me. You are being considerate in trying to address this issue early - you know she would have made a huge scene if you waited until Thanksgiving day.   \n\nSIL sounds like she has issues - not you.  You and your brother are dealing with your medical condition in a responsible manner.  Why the heck should SIL care if you prepare your portions and prepare your own plate early???\n\nMaybe SIL is jealous of you as a person and jealous of the relationship you have with your brother.  There is no reason for her to be so miserable about this, and then to start slinging disrespectful comments about your relationship with your BF?  \n\nSomething else is going on... I don't believe this is just about your dinner.  Good luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Meaning more food, not less.", "Basically I either weigh it and weighing it confirms in my brain that one (1) portion is permittable of everything I enjoy. Or I take a single teaspoon because the gremlin in my head is trash and worry my immediate family who know about my issues.", "With disordered eating, it\u2019s not just about the food. It\u2019s the ritual. Weighing it out is a way to NOT hyper focus and freak out at the possibility that it\u2019s too much. There is always a touch of obsession in ED and the familiarity of weighing to get the right portion size can help alleviate some of the stress.", "You should have just said NTA. Are you qualified to second guess a trained professionals advice.", "Weighing food is a tool to teach people what a healthy portion size is. It\u2019s fine to say, for example, \u201ceat 6 ounces of meat a day\u201d, but most people have no idea how much that is without weighing it. Same for saying, \u201cX servings of fruit & vegetables a day\u201d. If you don\u2019t know how much a serving is, that\u2019s not very helpful advice.

It's a scaffold measure - supports OP in training their brain into healthy patterns. And it doesn't sound like this is an everyday thing anymore - it's a way of coping with massive amounts of food, and OP's brain's tendency to react by overcompensating the other way and eating NOTHING.", "A lot of ED management is harm reduction.

SIL may still think OP is a just being a drama queen.", "I guess I'm just thinking that for me, it can be good if I go just under what the portion sizes are. So if I'm like \"I can eat 2 oz turkey\" I'd weigh 1.5 and go \"yeah that's enough\". Not all disorders are the same though obviously, I could be reading my own onto OP's.", "It's terrible (and yet interesting) how everyone's brain works a bit differently. If this helps you and your therapist approves, there should not be any issue. Your SIL is out of order on this and her reasoning is flawed.", "Yeah, it makes sense. I didn't mean it in a second-guessing way, it just isn't how my own disordered eating works. Weighing it would give me more motivation to lower the portions. I get not everybody works the same way. I guess I was just concerned and maybe it came across wrong, which wasn't my intention."]}
