Brother knows about this because it landed me in the hospital when we were younger. Now I normally don't do this at all but with Thanksgiving being a holiday specifically about overindulgence on food and that being something that I'm weird about, my therapist thought it would be fine if I weighed out a serving size of everything I wanted to eat there. \n\n\nNow normally I'd just ask Brother and he probably wouldn't care though he might ask to do it instead so I don't backside and that would be fine. The problem is, SIL keeps ragging on me for \"running to my brother crying everytime I scrape my knee\". Which I don't believe is true. Lately she's been going on about how, as the woman of the house, all Thanksgiving requests have to go through her. \n\n\nOkay sure, whatever, so a few days before Thanksgiving I ask her if I can pre-portion or weigh my food (the stuff that finishes before most of the guests come over) prior to the guests and set a plate aside. I specifically mentioned that I would come over early to do this and even offered, If she wanted, to help with setting the table/any last second cooking, I also may have mentioned that my brother would be fine with it as well. \n\n\nWell she blew up on me and made several comments about me not respecting her and how I'm too close to my brother and that I need to \"grow the fuck up and stop acting like a child just because you look like one.\"\n\n\nOkay, whatever, I guess. I stayed cool during this, but regardless I ended up telling her, that it's fine if she doesn't want to let me portion a plate with my foodscale beforehand, I just won't eat. \n\n\nWell that pissed her off even more and she made a couple of other comments regarding how I'm a leech on my brother/my family (I make almost as much as my brother and live in my own house?) And that I tried to steal her thunder this year by offering to host Thanksgiving when I \"don't even eat\" \ud83d\ude43. And implying that my S.O was only with me because I looked like a child. That finally pissed me off enough to snap back at her that even if I looked like a child, I'd rather look like that then the Pillsbury dough boy.  Now admittedly I do know she's sensitive about her weight and she used to ask me for dieting tips before my brother explained to her to *not* do that and what I said is a low blow.\n\n\nAnyway AITA?", "created_utc": 1669216710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2rra8/aita_for_requesting_a_special_plate_at/", "score": 640, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would take your food scale in your purse and when the food gets served bring it out and say \"DOCTORS ORDERS !\" smile nice and begin to weigh your portions. No Drama no discussion, just do it. she would have to fight you in front of everyone and i bet \"fluffy\" won't do that.", "NTA - This woman is a whole bunch of red flags. As Thanksgiving is going to be difficult and possibly triggering for you, I wouldn't advise that you trust her to be around you at Thanksgiving, which means I'd suggest you avoid spending Thanksgiving at their house. If you tell your brother why you've made this decision beforehand, his wife might well cause a load of drama, so I suggest you wait until afterwards, invite him over for coffee, and then show him your post and explain that you want to spend time with him, but that his wife is a risk to your health. Maybe the two of you can make a plan to carve out protected \"sibling time\" with each other, find some fun things to do together regularly, and maybe that'll either make his wife less weird, or cause her to do send up a red flag your brother will notice.", "My gosh.

It may be that she is so resentful because she is speaking on his behalf- expressing a sentiment that he cannot express to you because he loves you. It also may be that she has some serious jealous/protectiveness issues to work through, and he needs to check her in how she navigates around you.\n\nI think maybe ESH. But either way, I think you need to have a serious talk with your brother, because the way you talk to her and especially the way she talks to you sounds very nasty and unproductive.\n\nN T A for the portioning thing. That was therapist recommended and a reasonable request that you offered to assist in accommodating. Do what you need to do to stay healthy. Please don\u2019t let this trigger you into not eating for that meal- that WILL worry your brother and family, and it will villanize her. Talk to your brother about it.

You shouldn't have to go through your sister-in-law about a request. It doesn't matter who is or isn't cooking the food. Good luck with your recovery and Thanksgiving.", "ESH but you more than your SIL because you started it. A big dinner for a lot of people has a lot of moving parts & getting everything on the table at the same time at the right temperature is complicated. It doesn\u2019t help to have another person on the kitchen pulling food out of each dish to set up a plate ahead of time. There are some dishes that that would definitely spoil the look of. Are you going to cut a piece out of the pumpkin pie, too? My main point, however, is that if you\u2019ve been weighing your food for 2 years or 4 years, you shouldn\u2019t have to weigh it every time. You know how big 2 ounces (or whatever your portion is) of turkey is; take a piece that size. You should be able to look at a serving spoon & know how many spoons worth of potatoes or beans or whatever you can take. I did weight watchers for years & it\u2019s definitely something you learn.", "NTA.. but I hope your lonely Thanksgiving goes well, because I doubt she'll want you over now.", "ESH you a bit less than SIL.  \n\nReading this story I get a picture that SIL may eat more than is strictly healthy and you a bit less.  That sounds like absolute hell for each of you.  The same way you might get triggered, I wonder if SIL is being triggered.\n\nNeither of you handled it well.  Instead of dealing with the issue (food management) both of you took it personal.  A stressful holiday like Thanksgiving (or Christmas) is not the time to work these issues out.  But I do think some respectful conversation is appropriate when life has calmed down to improve this relationship.", "NTA - you have an ED. You keep saying that you're \"weird\" with food, but it's an ED. Does your SIL understand this? It doesn't seem like she does and is just building up resentment because she doesn't understand that an ED is a mental health issue and not just a quirk that you have. I think to further avoid this, and maybe explain why you rely on your brother so much, you and your brother should sit down with her and explain exactly what's wrong and why what she's saying is harmful and abusive. I'm not excusing her. Your SIL is mean and rude, and what she implied was uncalled for and could be harmful to recovery. But sometimes, even if someone technically \"knows\" what happened or what you have, they don't actually understand what it means or what it entails. (Example: Think of people who know what depression is but assumes that it just means you're sad and negative all time. They know what it means, but they don't really understand what happens to your mind and body when you're in an episode of depression.)", "NTA. If she can dish (heh) it, she can take it.\n\nAlso, even ignoring that she started it and is also systemically hostile to you and your relationship with your brother (jealous and toxic much?), being a dick to someone over their ED is orders of magnitude worse than insulting their vanity.\n\nFrom where I stand, you were *kind* to her. If it'd been me, I don't know if shed ever dare speak one word at me again.", "Esh", "NTA. If I understand this correctly, you're not asking for special food.  You are asking for special portions. Why the heck would this be such a problem for your SIL is beyond me. You are being considerate in trying to address this issue early - you know she would have made a huge scene if you waited until Thanksgiving day.   \n\nSIL sounds like she has issues - not you.  You and your brother are dealing with your medical condition in a responsible manner.  Why the heck should SIL care if you prepare your portions and prepare your own plate early???\n\nMaybe SIL is jealous of you as a person and jealous of the relationship you have with your brother.  There is no reason for her to be so miserable about this, and then to start slinging disrespectful comments about your relationship with your BF?  \n\nSomething else is going on...

It\u2019s fine to say, for example, \u201ceat 6 ounces of meat a day\u201d, but most people have no idea how much that is without weighing it.

Since you are in therapy already considder discussing this situation and how to best handle it, because i don't think this your approach of throwing insults back wil inprove the situation. Talk to your brother as well, perhaps sugest that his wife needs therapy to deal with her jealousy issues regarding you.", "I'm sorry. Are you ok?", "NTA and I know so many SILs that have an issue with their husband's closeness to their sister. I don't understand it.", "NTA I think you should call your brother, explain everything that happened & skip thanksgiving this year. Also make it abundantly clear you will not go to SIL\u2019s house for anything ever again; it was made perfectly clear you are not welcome! \n\nI\u2019m lazy so I would just send a group email to my parents, brother, family explaining what happened, what was said by both parties and that for your own mental health you will not go to your SIL\u2019s house ever again. I think your SIL has some deep marital issues that she is taking it out on you. Maybe years from now your SIL might make an earnest apology & mean it & change her attitude..... but I doubt it. \n\nSo do what brings you joy this thanksgiving!", "NTA. I hate the hypocrisy that she can comment on your size repeatedly but not the other way around (though I do understand different social stigmas apply). That said, she sounds incredibly unempathetic and judgmental. I cannot see how weighing your food would be controversial.\n\nThat said, is it possible to try another \"measurement\" system (ie: size of your palm, size of your finger, etc.) to help you do this in a less disruptive and embarrassing way?", "NTA and I cheered so hard when I read the pillsbury comment.", "NTA. The pillsborough Doughboy thing was funny as he'll. (1) Your therapist suggested it was a good idea. (2) you didn't demand anything but just asked - it never hurts to ask. She's the asshole. Insulting someone's mental health condition isn't cool.", "NTA. Wifey has some serious jealousy issues.", "NTA. Tell your brother what happened with his wife so he knows. Tell him that you are done talking to his wife because of it. You do not need more stress from her. Whether you still want to do Thanksgiving with them is up to you, but I hope you enjoy yourself.", "NTA.   \nYou made a simple request that didn't hurt anyone. She blew off the handle like a crazy person and throwing MULTIPLE insults. She's clearly insecure with those comments about you and your brother as well. Honestly, I probably would not come. No one, but especially someone struggling with their mental health should be in a toxic enviroment like that.", "NTA Pillsbury dough girl can suck it up. I agree with other people bring your own food", "She should definitely talk to her brother, and hopefully he\u2019ll side with her. It\u2019s not right that she should have to miss being with her family on Thanksgiving", "I\u2019d just not fucking go.", "I wouldn't trust anything SIL cooked, especially if she, pressured by her husband, \"apologized\" and presented OP with a pre-plated meal. Also, who  knows what SIL told the other guests and how they'll react to OP's pre-plated meal. It sounds like something that will draw a lot of unwanted attention and thoughtless comments, which is definitely the last thing she needs-ever.", "You know what... even without it being a mental health issue I don't see how asking to have food set aside would hurt the host in any way, especially if she said she would come earlier. I wouldn't be bothered by it. It's not asking for a completely separate, specific dish on a whim or anything. And sorry, but after MULTIPLE insults going her way, her comment isn't even close to almost sending her into any territory. The SIL was rude, unsympathetic, petty and actually quite cruel with her words but acts all offended when OP simply couldn't take more? Nah. It's not like we're not (in the end) on the same side here, but I'm definitely full on NTA and on OPs side, without any doubts.", "I understand why you feel that way and I even argued with my therapist when he requested that I start counting my calories. But he convinced me to try it for a week to \"prove him wrong\" that I wasn't eating enough. My brain told me I was eating way too much, but after just a few days, I could visually see that I wasn't even coming close to eating enough. Now I keep track of them so that I know that I'm getting enough food to stay alive, because without that visualization my brain convinces me that I only need very little.", "If SIL also knows that OP's life was so at risk that she had to be hospitalized, it makes  it even worse. OP was sensitive in voicing her needs, making her request (which was more than reasonable and considerate) and trying not to burden SIL with it and she was cruelly humiliated. What she said about OP's SO only being with her because she supposedly looks like a child was also pretty sick and disturbing. \n\nI think OP should bring her own plate....to the Thanksgiving gathering of people who would be understanding and supportive and welcome her to take care of her medical needs.", "Stop dealing with your SIL, just communicate with your brother, and ignore that she's upset by that. If she says you're being rude, that you need to deal with her, say no. \"No. You can't communicate respectfully, and you do not get to control the relationship I'm allowed with my brother. I will deal with my own issues as I need to and don't need your input.\". \n\nTell your brother to deal with her, you aren't going to be mistreated by her, and coordinate with him. Ignore her completely and keep him informed on her behaviour and comments; she's his problem to deal with. Just be polite, neutral, and distant with her when in her company; no real engagement, just polite brief and simple. \"Yes, no, don't worry about it, that's not your  concern, thanks for your opinion, etc.\" then move on and talk to others.", "I missed that. Good lord SIL sure is a winner eh?", "I admire all the hard work you've put into turning food weighing into something that supports your recovery and helps you keep perspective about what your mind and body need. Its difficult enough just do accomplish that, let alone when there's so much misunderstanding surrounding it and its easy for even caring people to freak out. Obviously I don't blame anyone for misunderstanding but I know what a burden it can be sometimes to have to take on the role of educating someone when you're really struggling to see your own problem and needs as valid and hold your own self together.", "I love the brain gremlin analogy to personify that illogical side of your brain, and stop blaming yourself. Not sure where you got that from but I plan to start applying this to my anxiety!"]}
