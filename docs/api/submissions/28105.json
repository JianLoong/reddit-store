We were out of town for her birthday. Yesterday we went over to MIL's house for lunch. My husbands siblings and some of their kids were also there, specially for this story Abby, who is 9. \n\nSo we brought the gift to give to Hallie. I didn't think it was a big deal. Abby also got a present from us for her birthday a few months ago. They're in the same price range (~$45), so it's not like we gave Abby a pencil for her birthday and Hallie an Xbox. \n\nRight before we left I gave Hallie my car keys and told her to go grab her present from the car. Abby went with her and came back and immediately started whining that she didn't get a present. I explained it was for Hallie's birthday and then Abby went to her parents and started a full on tantrum. \n\nNow Abby's Dad is mad at us and saying we should have given Hallie her present more \"discretely\" because it's not fair for one kid to get something. Funnily enough my 6 year old nephew understands the concept of a birthday present and is happily sitting on the floor while Hallie shows it to him. My husband and I are saying it's ridiculous to turn this around on us and everything was getting very unnecessarily heated imo. Abby's parents are harping on about \"fairness\" and then going in on MIL for letting Hallie open the gift and saying she should have been made to wait at least (Hallie's parents weren't there). \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Also I forgot to add that because Abby's parents brought Hallie to MIL's house that day they also thought it was more unfair for some reason? Like because they rode together its different because Abby has to sit with it in the car or something?
