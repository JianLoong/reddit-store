Feel free to give someone money with the clear caveat that they do not need to pay it back and that you do not expect it back.  If they feel like repaying it, fine, but you should never request it or even bring it up again.  Otherwise you are going to end up destroying the friendship.\n\nSecond, do not give money to people with a gambling addiction, you are literally throwing it away.  There is no situation in which they are not going to lose it all.  They need help and they need to realize that they need help and put effort into overcoming their addiction.  You can't do it for them and usually it is going to take them truly bottoming out before they can accept that they have a problem.\n\nYou should seriously consider your future with your GF.  If she is always going to try to finance her brother's addiction, she will drain all of your money and more over time.", "NTA and she\u2019s doing nothing but enabling her brother. This is a huge red flag for the future.", "You're NTA. You are not responsible for her brother's gambling problem and bad decisions. And neither she nor her family are entitled to the money you have earned.", "NTA\n\nGambling is a bottomless pit that can never be filled. Your girlfriend needs to wake up and stop giving money to her brother.", "NTA She needs to stop enabling him", "NTA and you need to leave her now because it gets worse", "NTA. That brother is a package deal with your gf. As long as he is in her life you are asking for trouble. It would be unfair of you to order her to go no-contact with him, so before you move forward with her you need to decide if what you have written here - the begrudging resentful loans, the accusations of selfishness, the lying - is going to be the story of the rest of your relationship, because I guarantee nothing will change no matter how much you wish and hope it would.", "NTA at all. Your girlfriend is pissing away all her money on her loser brother.\n\nIf I were you I'd reconsider this entire relationship. Where do you see both of you in 10 years? Married? What happens when she starts withdrawing from your joint checking account and starts sending him money that's both of your marital property? Maybe money your both saving up for a house is suddenly gone.\n\nThis is your future.", "you are not. have a talk with her and explain to her that she is enabling her brother and he is leeching off of her. good luck!\n\nhave a blessed day!", "NTA.\n\nNot a close one.\n\nNot for saying no. Not for the argument.", "When you told your gf about your economic situation, she immediately saw you as a bank for her brother. If she hasn't gone NC with him, then she might as well be his partner in trying to get money from you--and she will never stop. \n\nOnce they start using the attack words (such as \"selfish\") and the accusations, then you know what side they're on.\n\nNTA--but she and her brother are. Cut yourself loose before anything else happens.", "NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend is funneling her brother's lifestyle. She isn't entitled to your money in this scenario.", "NTA. But I think it's time to sit down and talk to her about the future. If she lends money to him all the time, how will you build a future together?", "NTA. Her brother is an addict and she's an enabler. Giving her money will let her know that she can keep enabling her brother and you'll pick up the slack for her financially.", "NTA- at the end of the day it is your money and you get to decide how it is spent, and it is understandable if you don't want it going into the pockets of someone who will probably just loose it straight away. Your girlfriend may be feeding her brothers gambling addiction without realising it as she is giving him the opportunity to gamble. Maybe some time in jail would do him some good (although a grim thought).", "NTA. She needs to stop enabling him or he will never experience the consequences of his poor choices, which means he has NO reason to change his behavior.", "NTA! It doesn't matter how you built up your savings -earned, inherited or won... it's your money and no one is entitled to it, except yourself. I think you did the right thing. My brother used to do this and my ex as well, constantly asking for money to feed their addictions... as soon as you hand that money over,  it's wasted. Your gf can ask for money but when you said no, she should have dropped it - she's being an AH because of this. Her bf needs help, not a means to feed his addiction which your gf is doing.", "NTA. Your gf is responsible for her own finances and she made a decision to give him money. If she wanted you to bail him out, she should have asked you first.", "NTA. Your gf enables her brother.", "NTA. So he \"gambled\" on a business and failed.\n\nTo be clear: there is no loan here. You'll never get that money back.", "NTA. Don't tell your gf how much money you have in stocks or savings and don't give her any money.", "NTA giving her money is giving it to him, as the only reason she is asking is because she gave that money to him already, and by trying to make out like you're the ass hole here she is trying her damnedest to drag you into the hole with her brother.  Time to bail, this one is not worth saving.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe anyone your money.", "NTA\n\nUnless your GF cuts him off this shit will never stop. The \"you have savings, you won't miss it\" type of argument is bullshit. The brother wouldn't be in debt if he didn't have a gambling problem.\n\nShe also isn't \"lending\" him money she is just paying off his debt. She'll never see that money again. And you won't either if you give them any.", "NTA\n\nI agree - what you give to your girlfriend, would fund her brother's gambling habit.  It would be a waste of money.\n\nIf her brother is $200K in debt, the odd few thousand is not going to help.  Any money your girlfriend gives him, he will gamble away, thinking that he will win big and pay his debts off.\n\nYour girlfriend is asking for $4000 now - in a month or two, she will be asking for another $4000.  It will never stop.\n\nEDIT: Some folk are talking of OP or his girlfriend loaning money to her brother. This money is not loaned - it will never be repaid.", "NTA- do not give your gf money. She's giving more than she can afford and she needs to learn to take care of herself before her brothers gambling", "Of course you're NTA for not lending money. You might as well burn it immediately.\n\nEven if there was a business venture, how is that not gambling? And how is not giving that bum your money to gamble away selfish? Care to guess who the selfish people here are?\n\n*Edit: double verb removed*", "NTA at all\nYour GF is not entitled to your money,  and you are certainly not obligated to enable her brother.", "NTA. I've been down this addiction road with a \"friend\". He was great at playing the simpathy card with people because he suffered some injustice at someone else's hand. Giving them money never helps, it just makes it way worse. \n\nYour GF should not be giving more than she can afford to do without in the first place. But my wife is the same. Would give the shirt off her back to help someone she think is need. But it's not that easy. He might really be manipulating her without her realizing it. \n\nI would recommend looking up ways to best assist someone with an addiction (lots online) and sit with her and go through it.\n\nSaying no to people with addiction can turn quite bad. Insults and threats are not uncommen. But you are 100% NTA to not give money, and not giving away your hard earned money to support someone else's addiction are in no way selfish. Hope you can find your way through this.", "Speaking from experience, unless she learns to set boundaries from her addicted brother, she's only going to drag you down with her. \n\nTalk to her about boundaries and her enabling behaviour. If she doesnt see your point, leave. Trust me, it will only get worse...", "NTA - she shouldn't be giving away money (basically throwing it away in this case) if it leaves her financially strapped. You covering her is just enabling her to continue to make dumb decisions.", "NTA. Find a new girlfriend who doesnt consider u a bank\u2026.this will not end well. Been there done that.", "NTA  Your girlfriend needs to stop funding her brother.  It's not on you to make up for her shortsightedness concerning her brother.  Honestly don't know how you will get her to see the light.", "NTA - your girlfriend is codependent and bailing out her brother. Her behavior allows him to avoid hitting rock bottom which could lead to changing his ways. Stay strong - addiction is really hard. I\u2019d suggest if you can find some books on codependent to read them and share when she\u2019s ready.", ">She said it's not gambling this time but a failed business venture.\n\nSame thing (although he's probably lying). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She said I am being very selfish because I have around $180k in stocks and $4000 is only 2% of my portfolio.'\n\nYou're selfish because you're responsible with money and won't help enable someone who's not? (You're also 0% responsible for her brother)\n\n**NTA** and you might want to reevaluate your relationship with your gf who's not only enabling her brother while throwing thousands of her dollars away, but also shaming you for not also being willing to do so.", "NTA\n\nYour gf is acting out of love but really hurting herself and her brother, even though she doesn't realize it.\n\nI was exactly like your gf and kept giving money to my brother. My partner was very gentle but firm with me and explained how I was just enabling my brother's behavior and he was a bottomless pit. I didn't listen for a long time, lost so much money, and got very hurt. I hope your gf can stop.", "NTA.  \n\nBreak up with her.  This will get worse if you get married.", "Firstly, If the brother wants to borrow that kind of money, he can damn well ask you himself.\n\nThat's what I'd tell your gf, that if he wants your help he needs to convince you that it's actually worthwhile himself.\n\nI don't think that's an unreasonable ask.\n\nIf you and your gf are in serious long term territory, then I think you should probably at least hear the brother out, provided you haven't done so already. Yes, it's not an insubstantial sum he's asking for, but given your means it's not really going to hurt you as a one-time thing, and given that you and your girl are in it for the long haul he is effectively family. \n\nBut yea, only if he both has the balls to ask you himself and can make a convincing case that you are not just setting the money on fire in a dumpster. \n\nUntil he manages that, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Reconsider how often this happens and maybe find another girlfriend.", "NTA plus, your gf know how much money you have saved and she's enabling her brother. As you already stated, she thinks you can help wipe clean his debts, ignoring the fact that he'll drag himself right back to where he was before. I assume youve been dating for a bit and that's why she know the exact values you have saved, but it seems like she's counting and comparing it to the total debt that's ever increasing. I'd keep that money secret or she won't let it go until you offer financial assistance. Giving thousands like that to her brother is a big issue but you've done good work to grow your own nest egg. Don't lose it to give to these two. Her brother needs treatment before the debts will go away", "NTA: You should 100% be learry of being a bank account for your gf's brother.  If this were a situation where she was helping a family member out with a true one off expense (her mom's car broke down or someone broke a leg) I feel like it might be justified to help out a little, but 4k isn't something I'd even feel comfortable asking from a friend or SO.  I mean if you were a multi-millionaire or something where it truly didn't matter maybe, but 180k is not even a large retirement fund for someone at your age.", "NTA\n\nYou could consider for the sake of your relationship that you will give her the money, but you are trusting her that it's not for the gambling.   It's basically  a test or a lesson to see if he really is over his gambling or just more lies and may open your gf's eyes.\n\nBut i use the word \"give\" purposely as although you can cal it a loan you should assume you'll never see it again.   I say this for your benefit not theirs.    I have had friends ask for money before and i've lent it to them, but in my head written it off.    Luckily they have all paid it back anyway.", "Also a business venture is a type of a gamble anyway right?  Just different type, if it\u2019s even true.  If he has debt to pay he should stop gambling and work to pay off his own debt but it\u2019s no one else\u2019s problem.  It\u2019s completely enabling, she\u2019s making it easier for him to not change.  She needs to understand and in reality OP is enabling her by continuing to make it easier on her to help the brother", "100% agree. Mixing love and money is tough - even when you are married. It\u2019s best avoided when you aren\u2019t.", "Yes, absolute NTA. The brother obviously has a gambling addiction. The best way you can help your girlfriend is by refusing to feed that addiction. \n\nAlso, I imagine that he\u2019s not using the 4K to pay off debt, he\u2019s gambling it, convinced he will win and be able to pay off his 100K debt. \n\nThere is a really good book about addiction called \u2018America Anonymous\u2019. It follows the lives of five or six addicts, and a couple of them are gambling addicts. It offers some really great insight into the mind of a gambling addict - I learnt so much from reading it. \n\nI\u2019d be encouraging your girlfriend to learn a bit about gambling addiction and how to support people with it. (And it\u2019s not by enabling the addict by \u2018paying off debt\u2019)."]}
