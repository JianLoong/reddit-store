{"id": 7290, "submission_id": "10bcaxq", "title": "AITA for paying off my gf's debt without telling her and bringing her the receipt as a Christmas present during a family get-together?", "selftext": "**ETA**: Sorry for not being able to reply to your comments one by one. To answers some of your questions:\n\nNo. She was not embarassed or angry about me 'outing' her being in debt. She didn't care. Everyone knew about it. Please read my post carefully. She was so ecstatic at first when she realized I had paid off her debt. \n\nShe was upset because we had been planning this get-together for weeks and everyone was expected to bring a gift. She was expecting something tangible as some commenters here say. It is a family tradition. I should have at least brought an 'actual' gift she could unwrap with her family. She said I wasn't taking it seriously.\n\n.\n\nI (M 35) and my gf (F 29) have been in a serious relationship for almost two years now. This happened last month a few weeks before Christmas. We had been talking about having a family get together or a small gift exchange party with her family, since my family lives too far away and I wouldn't be able to celebrate with them. She had been really excited about it for weeks since it would be our first time celebrating together as a couple and with her family.\n\nI am in no way rich but my job pays me really well and I make a lot more than she does, so the bills are not split evenly. But I don't mind at all. She took out a personal loan from a bank a few years ago to buy a car which she paid down monthly. Most of her salary went towards paying down on the car each month, something she was always complaining about because it had deprived her of getting the things she wanted to have, like clothes, shoes, bags, etc. But five months to go and she would be debt-free.\n\nWithout telling her, I decided to pay off the remaining sum of her debt as a Christmas present, thinking she would be ecstatic. So during the Christmas get-together at her parents house, when the time to exchange gifts finally came, I gave her an envelope containing the bank receipt of her already paid-off loan. She was so touched and started crying happy tears while hugging me. But then she went like \"So where's my christmas gift?\"\n\nI was confused so I told her that me paying off her debt was my Christmas gift for her. She said \"No. The actual Christmas gift. We've talked about this. Everyone was expected to bring a real present to give to someone tonight.\"\n\nI just gave her a confused look. And she went \"So you actually bought nothing for me?\" I looked at her in utter confusion while everyone was staring at us. Her face turned red and she finally excused herself into the next room. Later that night we had a huge fight. She said though she was really grateful that I paid off her debt, I ruined our first Christmas with her family by not getting her anything at all. I should have at least bought her something. It didn't have to be something really expensive, maybe a sweater, watch, etc. I insisted that I bring the receipt as her Christmas present and she shook her head and went into the bedroom to sleep.\n\nWe're okay now but somehow I get the impression that she's still disappointed in me and this would probably be brought up for weeks to come.

Definitely nta tho.", "NTA. I\u2019d be grateful if someone paid off my debt. You did a really thoughtful and helpful thing imo and the issue lies with her. Maybe she felt left out when everybody is opening actual (tangible) presents and she has a non-tangible one. She reacted poorly and should\u2019ve just be grateful.", "If she doesn't think it's an actual present, I guess you can go ahead and cancel the payment. NTA.", "NTA. In what world is paying off someone's debt not a \"real gift?\" I would actually prefer someone pay off my car note rather than give me a sweater I probably won't even wear...", "NTA. But maybe she was embarrassed that it was in front of family? They may not have known about the size of her debt. It sounds like you might have stumbled into some family dynamic thing.", "There is something very wrong with your girlfriend. She is an ungrateful AH and quite shameless, apparently. You\u2019re NTA.", "NAH\n\nYou decided on a big financial gesture. But for lots of people holidays are about sentimentality. This mostly sounds like a miscommunication about what's important to each of you on Christmas.", "NTA.\n\nThat was an incredible gift. You knew her debt was negatively affecting her life and you did something about it. This is not the same as handing someone an envelope full of cash as many here have suggested. You were thoughtful about making her life better.\n\nI get that she wanted a little something tangible to open on Christmas, but it seems ungrateful to say she didn't get a real gift.", "NTA - The AH is your GF!\n\nWhat you did was really sweet and thoughtful (and a heck of a lot more expensive than a cheesy gift)\n\nYour GF sounds materialistic!", "NTA. Is your girlfriend very immature or something? How does she not recognize the receipt as a real gift? Does she put so much stock in objects that a teddy bear or a sweater would mean more to her than what you gave her? Anyone can buy a teddy bear or a sweater. Not everyone would think to pay off someone's debt - to me that's the really thoughtful gift.", "Your girlfriend is being entitled to demand a gift the way that she did, but you've also learned something about how people think about gifts, irrational as it may be. \n\nWould you ever just hand your girlfriend a wad of cash and say 'happy christmas'? No? Giving money is not always seen as gift-y, because it's impersonal and transactional.\n\nYours was slightly more personalised to her, yes, and generous, but essentially you gave her money for Christmas, and as much as she appreciated the paying off the debt, she didn't see it as the same as a Christmas gift. She was expecting something more symbolically gifty and personal.\n\nThat said, she's far too old to be pouting or complaining about not having an object to unwrap, and it's ridiculous to say you 'ruined Christmas'.\n\nNTA but lesson learned.", "NTA\n\nIt was a wonderful gesture on the face of it but I suspect what she was trying to say was \"Why didn't you buy me a sweet little gift rather than making me feel like a financially incompetent dependent child in front of your family.\".", "NTA. You gave an amazing gift to a greedy, ungrateful person.", "NTA. And she\u2019s not someone I would want to be with. Ungrateful.", "NTA - sorry, I'll make no excuses for your GF:  she's greedy AF.  You restored her *freedom of action* financially; I can't think of anything more considerate than that.  But she complains, wanting some tawdry bauble to wave about before her family?  That's incredibly shallow and immature.", "Your girlfriend is entitled and a moocher. You paid off a debt that probably caused her a lot of stress and instead of being grateful she\u2019s greedy just holding her hand out for more. \n\nShe\u2019s showing you who she is and it\u2019s not pretty.", "NTA. Amazing gift. You listened to her. She was complaining about the car debt and you freed her from it. Only one problem you wasted on an ungrateful person. Not your fault at all. Anyways if she doesn\u2019t like I would cancel the payment and get her a cheap dollar store bear. She\u2019s going to need something \u201cTangible\u201d to hug when you dump her a**.", "INFO: How well off is her family?\n\nThe debt may represent something different for each of you.  Example (not saying its the case, hence info), if her family could have paid for the car, the debt represented her financial independence.\n\nHonestly, paying off debt doesn't seem like the type of gift you give to them in front of their family.  You read about those tik tok people who purposely pay for other people's groceries or give random money out?  That's what you have done.", "NTA. At All. She is. Wow, this almost sounds made up if she\u2019s really that dense and ungrateful.", "*Not a real gift???*\n\n  \n  Bro if my SO paid even a fraction of my student loan debt I'd be gargling that chode so often i'd get tonsillitis, get it removed then use my new-found super human deepthroating abilities to suck his balls dry till retirement.\n\n(you know, when my student loan debt would have been paid off.)\n\n  \n*...Not a real gift...*", "I'm dating myself but this was the plotline to an episode of Cheers.\n\nAnyway, OP, you're NTA and your GF should have been more grateful.

He told her that he\u2019d planned on giving that to her too. To the great annoyance of the staff person who earned a one percent bonus for the sale, the husband returned the necklace and I think the wife got a divorce for her anniversary\u2026. Some people just can\u2019t see how blessed they are. You\u2019re NTA.", "I wonder if she would have preferred you not pay off the debt and give her a gift instead.

That's a pretty great gift. Though what you could have done better was packaging the gift, I suppose. Like, don't just give her the receipt outright. Give her a card or write her a note and put it in a puzzle box or something. It doesn't have to be expensive. Her asking for more feels like she's disregarding your effort for appearances sake.", "NTA.\n\nI think paying off someone's debt without asking is a really risky move, and kind of out of order. However, you took the risk and it paid off, she was happy you did it.\n\nHer total lack of gratitude for me would be a major problem here, you paid off what I assume is in the order of thousands of dollars, and she still wants more?\n\nThat's pretty shit of her.", "NTA be sure to never give her an itinerary for a fantastic vacation or a gift card for a fabulous spa day. Gotta have some mishmash to unwrap or it is thoughtless apparently. Holy hell. Seriously you gave a thoughtful and generous gift. She was immature and ungrateful and should apologize.", "NTA- unless she told you want she wanted specifically how would you know that that wouldn't be a good gift. Anyone I know would love to be surprised with their debt payed off.", "Freedom from debt is such a shit gift. do better... /s\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "This woman has problems. It's all surface for her, no substance.\n\nI find her baffling. NTA", "NTA\n\n\nSo just go ahead and cancel that payment and get this girl a sweater... Then get yourself a better girlfriend!", "NTA. I understand that maybe there's some sentimentality issue here, though? Once my siblings and I were all adults, my parents started giving us cash for Christmas, in a significant amount. But they still always get us something small with it to \"have something to open.\" Totally unnecessary, but still really sweet and thoughtful of them. I think part of why they do it is because they host our extended family as well, so it doesn't draw attention to the cash gift as we all open gifts together. This year I got a pound of specialty coffee beans from a local roaster. Maybe that's where her head is at?", "NTA. She sounds very ungrateful. You said most of her money was going toward her debt so she wasn\u2019t able to buy things she wanted. Well now she can do that. She should look at it that way. I would cancel this payment if I were u since it wasn\u2019t good enough for her.", "NTA and I would seriously rethink this relationship. She kust showed you who she is.", "You're NTA. In no way could you be the asshole. She's ungrateful.", "NTA please don\u2019t get married. You are a gentlemen and she, quite frankly, is not a lady.  You deserve a lady with manners and breeding.  Set her free.", "ESH.  Perhaps you had the best intentions, but it's just weird to bring a receipt to a family celebration.  It's almost like you were trying to show off for her folks.  And her reaction makes no sense, unless drama is a regular thing, which based on \"this would probably be brought up for weeks to come\"  sounds like it's the case.  The two of you don't seem very connected for a \"serious relationship\".", "NTA - I also think this was a beautiful gift. As a woman, she probably was hoping for something personal. Something that meant you\u2019ve hear her in the past and remembered something in particular that she liked. I suspect it has little to do with the gift and more that she wanted you to reflect on something more intimate and personal. I don\u2019t think this means she is greedy or ungrateful. You need to talk to her.\n\nMight seem silly, but do this quiz with her. https://5lovelanguages.com\nIt runs through a series of questions that ultimately describes how you\u2019d like love expressed to you. Some people like gifts, some just like the words \u201cI love you\u201d, some folks need touch.", "ESH. Your heart was in the right place, but that gift should have been given in private. Her reaction is WAY over the top though.", "NTA. Run now. How ungrateful. Wow.", "NTA, what an amazing gift abd gesture, plus you presented it as a gift! It's not like you nonchalantly just told her \"oh yeah, I played off your debt btw. Merry Christmas I guess.\"\n\nIt boggles my mind that she doesn't see this any other way.", "NTA. Maybe you should have wrapped it in a box or something though.", "NTA how ungrateful! Tell her she now owes you the balance, and get her something that only costs like $1", "Your girlfriend has a very crappy entitled attitude.  Next time, get her nothing.", "NTA. Wow, your gf is unreal. You ruined Christmas?? You spent presumably thousands of dollars on her and she expected more. She's entitled and spoiled.", "NAH \n\nWhile I understand your train of toughts, the debt payoff receipt, has no visual impact, for a celebration with more people around, so, yes, it is Indeed a Great present, as a couple, but not as a \"showoff\"... It's not that she wanted to showoff or anything, don't get me wrong, but a little present, that you can visually show to other people, as she said like a sweater, a watch, or something small, not even expensive, so she can show people like \"aaawwww this is so Nice, it fits me right\", bla bla bla\nI'm not even sure if i'm explaining myself succesfully \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb but if u understand me, just apologize to her and tell her that it was with no mean intentions, explain toughtfully how you perceived things about this present, and such", "NTA \nanyone who agrees with your girlfriend is an immature AH", "ESH. You because while paying off months\u2019 worth of debt is really generous, it should have been a private discussion, not a public gift.  There are lots of people who would be deeply uncomfortable with a gift like that.  It has implications regarding her independence, and many people would feel indebted to someone who gave them such a big gift.  You\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t feel that way.  And she obviously sucks because she acted like a child, wanting an tangible gift, too.", "Soft YTA-you don\u2019t give \u201ccash\u201d as a gift to your SO, ever and you especially don\u2019t do that in front of other family members. I genuinely understand that you didn\u2019t know that, so you\u2019re not really an AH, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you went out and got a gift to fix the situation either. She appreciates what you did, but she\u2019s conflicted because she knew that it wasn\u2019t really appropriate and she doesn\u2019t want to appear ungrateful. \n\nYou have a good one there. She\u2019ll help you navigate life well.", "YTA\n\nIt is very nice of you, but this would be better handled if you did this privately.  Doing this in front of families could be embarrassing.  Making this as a private gesture shows more grace and class.  Buy a nice appropriate gift.", "I think YTA and here's why;\n\nShe seems more upset at the lack of instruction following, and the fact that at her *parents* holiday shindig in front of everyone you basically announced, \"hey, my girlfriend had debt! And I'm so amazing I paid it for her!\"\n\nPaying the debt should have been discussed with her beforehand, or if you just had to surprise her, the place to let her know is at home, not in front of a crowd.\n\nSo like, the paying off her debt is fantastic, but that wasn't the time or place man.", "YTA. Serious relationship for 2 years and you essentially handed her an envelope of cash for Christmas. Come on.\n\nShe would have done better to save the reaction for a private discussion with you, but I can't really call her an asshole.", "NTA. This is a thoughtful gesture but it might be a bit of an overstep. You would have had to invade her privacy just to be able to pay the loan (to get banking/payment information) and it\u2019s kind of questionable to present personal financial information in front of her whole family. That said, expecting a gift on top of that is over the top.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that she needed you to get her something material that she could present in front of people instead of being grateful that even though your relationship isn't super long, you were willing to pay off a debt that would free up both of your futures is astounding to me.\n\nIt feels like no matter what you do no matter how sentimental it'll be it won't be enough because it's not something she can grasp. Unless you two can talk about why it wasn't received the way you had hoped, and honestly how a lot of us would have reacted which is with happiness, maybe you should rethink being with this person", "NTA. Sounds like a generous gift. My parents did the same for me with my remaining college debt and I was beyond thrilled.", "NTA, that was a very nice gift. It was very thoughtful and something she really needed. To be honest I would be really upset with her about this. She seemed very ungrateful and immature about it. \nI feel deep down she was expecting a ring which is part of the reason she was so upset.", "NTA.  That was a beautiful gift.  But...yeah, you probably should have gotten her something tangible.  That's what she's hurt about.  It's not about the amount of money that you spent.", "YTA. That is an embarrassing 'gift' flex.", "NTA - personally I think OP and his GF may not be financially compatible. \n\nShe constantly complains about no being able to buy personal items. He solves that. The remainder of the loan was at least $1500 to $2000 if not more. This girl then yells at him and calls the man a crappy bf. Like wtf.", "NAH. It's really a miscommunication. What you did was extremely generous, but a lot of people (myself included) really prefer something tangible and sentimental. This was, essentially, an extremely generous cash gift; I'd take new slippers/fuzzy socks over a cash gift any day.", "ESH", "NTA. It seems to me like your girlfriend was bothered by something related to her family dynamic at the party and she\u2019s not able to verbalize this to you - either she\u2019s uncomfortable talking about it or can\u2019t even express the sentiment herself.", "Sorry, YTA.  You should have gotten her something to open.  The receipt was nice but should most likely have been given to her in private.

Gift giving is part of showing how well you know someone and giving them something that means something to them.  You essentially gave her cash.
