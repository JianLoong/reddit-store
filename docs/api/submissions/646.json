I was on board with it, but I am super picky and had no idea what this restaurant had. We get there, I look at the menu, and nothing looks even semi-good. For example, all of the sandwiches had wheat bread only and I hate wheat. Anyway, I let her order her food and when the lady asks what I want, I told her I wasn\u2019t eating. I told my girlfriend I wanted her to enjoy the meal and I was happy to be there. My girlfriend got so mad, got up and left. I left with her and asked what the big deal was. She insists that I need to be there eating with her. We ended up going somewhere else together, but it irritated me. Am I in the wrong here?\n\nUpdate: It was some french cafe. I\u2019ve never been to a french restaurant, but I was willing to check it out. Their menu wasn\u2019t very big. I just wanted her to enjoy a nice meal.\n\nUpdate: There was no waitress. We ordered at the counter and they put the food on our tray. Also, we had been together for 10 months so I don\u2019t think there is much to feel awkward about.\n\nUpdate: I have no allergies. For the most part, I can usually find something to eat at a restaurant, but this French restaurant had nothing worth eating (in my opinion).\n\nUpdate: I didn\u2019t google the menu beforehand because we\u2019ve never gone to a restaurant that I couldn\u2019t find something to eat. This was a lunch, not a dinner.\n\nUpdate: Okay, so I just learned that all bread is made of wheat (we are all smart in different ways). It was some type of whole grain or sourdough. What I meant to say is I only like white bread, but brioche buns are good too.\n\nUpdate: 10 months into the relationship and we never went to a place where I couldn\u2019t find something to eat. This was the first time this happened. Also, I do try new things. I\u2019m not stubborn with it, but usually it is me trying her food because I only order things I know I will like.

How much of a surprise could it have been that you didn't like anything?\n\nIf you're that picky, I think the burden is on you to do some research ahead of time--the way someone with a food allergy or other dietary restrictions would--to determine if there is something on the menu you can eat.

You had genuinely good intentions of just wanting to let your girlfriend try out a new restaurant. It was harsh of her to act out how she did when she could have more calmly explained that the situation makes her uncomfortable. \n\nWe don\u2019t get to decide what food will revolt us, it\u2019s a combination of genetic and environmental factors from our upbringing that result in picky eating. I understand that it can be annoying for others to accommodate the picky eater, but usually the picky eater feels pretty bad about this too and will try to ease the stress anyway possible, like you did. I don\u2019t get why everywhere has to make food so complicated, wouldn\u2019t it benefit them to have at least one simple item to appeal to kids and older people with restrictive needs?\n\nIn the future, check the menu, it\u2019s the most basic thing a picky eater can do to prevent issues, but you\u2019re not an asshole for not doing it one time. Now you also know that your partner will probably enjoy certain dining experiences with friends more than you, or that you should try to order at least one thing.

It seems like you did the same. Let her pick a place, and simply decided to eat later when they didn't have anything you liked.

I get it, i have taste and/or texture aversions to most breads but also a sandwich restaurant should have enough selection for safe foods like white bread, but sometimes they dont and honestly, googling a menu is only useful about 25% of the time if it isnt a chain. Hell doordash restaurants leave ingredients off burgers all the damn time. Ive probably had over 50 burgers on delivery menus refunded since the panini started cuz they have mayo on them (which i cant eat) but it isnt listed on the menu. Sometimes you gotta go in person to ask questions then just... not get to eat there and it sucks but its better than vomiting a bunch.", "YTA \nPicky eaters are so exhausting.  Sharing a dining experience with them is so limiting and seems like half the time they will just want to go to the same, limited choices over and over.  \nIt's different if someone has dietary restrictions because of medical issues, religion, or they're vegan/vegetarian.  Restrictions like that are easy to understand and there's reasoning behind them and eating can be planned accordingly.  \nSomeone just wanting nuggies and hating on wheat bread is a nightmare.

There are people on here and in these stories who are legitimate assholes, but you not liking certain foods shouldn't make you one. You're a picky eater, fine. Yeah you could've searched up the menu and ask her what they serve and then communicated with her beforehand instead of finding out right then and there. Maybe even get a pastry with some coffee or something outside of sandwiches just so she doesn't feel alone eating. Honestly though, given all of the stories we've read on here, the fact her boyfriend (you) still took her to get what she wants to because you wanted to treat her despite not finding ANYTHING for yourself to eat is nice.

I have stories that are similar to the situation that went a little easier. I love sushi, but my husband hates it and thinks it\u2019s gross. He still takes me to get sushi and will sit across from me without eating anything from that place just to let me be happy, then we go to someplace he likes and he gets himself something special. People have sensory problems. People have aversions to food and that\u2019s fine. The beauty of being an adult is controlling your own diet even if it\u2019s refusing to eat whole grain bread.

Does eating something need to be a requirement?", "NTA. Fellow picky eater here and no.

I\u2019d have been more upset that he got something he didn\u2019t like and wasted the food and money or that I picked a place he couldn\u2019t enjoy at all.

Your response to not having food you wanted was to simply not order something but want her to enjoy food that she wanted to try. Her response to you not wanting to eat was to have a HISSYFIT.

Even if it is just bread, you are completely just in your not eating at this restaurant. I can understand your girlfriends POV, because she probably really did want you to eat a meal there with her, but for her to get upset over that fact is a little childish in my opinion. You were already happy to be there and let her enjoy eating something.\n\nI\u2019d say next time probably try to look at the menu beforehand, I always do even though I\u2019m not picky, but if you forget, and don\u2019t like anything, no one should make you feel bad for that.", "NTA op because it was a lunch and it\u2019s weird that it mattered to her.

In fact, I\u2019d argue with all the people comparing you to a toddler, that your girlfriend getting up and stomping out of a restaurant after she\u2019s already ordered her food was the real toddler level behavior.", "Im gonna go against the grain and say NTA. Simply bc theres nothing wrong with what you did. You didnt make a scene, you were respectful towards your gf and she shouldnt have thrown a tantrum (like an actual toddler) and run away. At work, when a friend and i went to have our break together she often times wouldnt be able to pick something from the menu bc the 4 options often included ingredients she didnt like. Thats okay. Who am i to force her or get mad over food she doesnt want to eat? \n\nPeople are still so hung up over the fact that we HAVE to like every food and dont realize that most picky eaters arent really picky eaters, but that the options given to them are often made of stuff they cant/dont like to eat. Everyone has a list of foods they dont like. Now imagine being surrounded by restaurants and cafes and shops where mostly that is being sold. A nightmare. \n\nNow even if someone only eats nuggets and fries or mac n cheese, then thats how it is. You can, with their consent, try out different foods together and see if they like it. But some people need to stop acting like their a parent and get mad over this. Especially if its your partner ffs. As long as picky eaters are nice about it i dont see why everyone feels the need to get upset about it.", "As a side note, being a \u201cpicky eater\u201d isn\u2019t about being a whimsical little shit that intentionally makes other peoples lives difficult, like many commenting on this post seem to believe. \n\nMany people who are \u201cpicky\u201d have sensory issues they can\u2019t properly put into words or have a not so obvious eating disorder. \n\nBeing labeled a \u201cpicky eater\u201d by the nurses at a hospital when I had an eating disorder on file meant I starved for 3 days and they thought it was funny.

I\u2019m sure it made her feel like you were just doing it to make her happy and that you didn\u2019t want to be at the restaurant.\n\nYou guys need to have a conversation, and you need to learn to Google the menu before you agree to go somewhere if it\u2019s an issue for her.

You don\u2019t give a lot of information on your picky eating, so I don\u2019t know what your issues are stem from, but even if you never like anything new that you try, trying still isn\u2019t bad in and of itself.

French cuisine usually has heavy cream sauces or quite a bit of rich pastry, so if you\u2019re looking for a light lunch, I can see why nothing seemed really appetizing.

The book The Man Who Ate Everything by Jeffrey Steingarten is a great book that deals with some of this. It was written by a former food critic who made it his mission to get past certain severe food aversion. But there\u2019s also been numerous studies done that show that a person often needs to be exposed to a certain food several dozen times before your taste buds kinda align with the new food. And even with foods you absolutely can\u2019t stand, repeated small dose exposure can over come it eventually. \n\nIt takes persistence and time. I have the gene that makes cilantro taste like sewage. But I read Jeffrey Steingarten\u2019s book over a decade ago, and ever since then I don\u2019t avoid cilantro and instead forced myself to eat *tiny* bits of it whenever it was in a dish. It took years but it finally went from puke inducing to gross, to unpleasant, to not that noticeable. I still don\u2019t like it much but I can now eat tacos without fear of the green leaf monster. That one was my worst aversion and literally encoded into my dna. Other foods I didn\u2019t care for initially just took a 6-12 repeated tries to eventually develop a taste and fondness for. Like hummus took a solid 5-6 tries, but now I love it. Nigiri took 2-3 solid years to get into but now it\u2019s one of my favorites. Beets took awhile, as did avocados. I enjoy both now! Point is, if you persist, many foods can be onboarded to your taste palette. It just takes effort and time.\n\nNow there\u2019s a good argument that no one needs to devote this kind of time and effort to bending your tastes in this way, when you can just simply not eat the foods you don\u2019t like. I think that\u2019s valid! Put your energy where you want. But I also feel like people don\u2019t understand that there\u2019s quite a bit of science/research on taste and how repeated exposure really is a huge factor. Trying something once or twice isn\u2019t really the threshold for developing new tastes.", "He absolutely did not.

He used to eat everything. Some favorites included salmon, chicken curry, okra, squash, and sweet potatoes. Now it's like exclusively dinosaur chicken nuggets, taquitos and blueberries at home. I think it's a control thing but holy poop is it frustrating. I still offer the foods we're eating and at least ask him to try it but he won't eat a full serving of anything that isnt processed.", "My eldest was the same way- great eater with a wide diet and then all of a sudden she wasn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t get her to eat anything. I talked with pediatricians, nutritionists, etc. She\u2019s been picky since she was a toddler. She\u2019d sooner starve or throw up than eat something she didn\u2019t like. She\u2019s improved over the years (she\u2019s now a teen) but she\u2019s still the pickiest of my 4 kids.

It sucks when the blame is always put on parents bc sometimes that's just how some kids are.", "Gosh, I was the 'eat everything' kid. Ironically, it was my dad who was always getting me to eat everything and yet it was his precious darling mummy who convinced baby me that I suddenly had allergies unknown to man.\n\nIt's exhausting to be on the receiving end of 'picky eater' hate. There's usually a reason for it and it's not just 'only wanting to eat nuggets'.", "There is an evolutionary reason why toddlers go off a lot of food at 3-5 years old. In hunter gatherer times they are now old enough to wander around and to stop them poisoning themselves they start to find a lot of vegetables and leafy things really bitter and unpalatable. The advice for normal kids who were eating lots of foods before this is to keep them available to try every few months for when they're out of this phase, make sure they get something to eat they will eat and be non judgemental, just accept it if they don't like tomatoes today, try and frame it like that \"oh I see you don't like tomatoes today, that's ok. Do you want to try cucumber instead?\" And like all things it should pass. Good luck toddlers are really tough and also amazing!!!", "And sometimes it's the strictness of the parents that is the problem. Trying new foods as a kid was basically traumatizing--if I didn't like it, I was a \"wuss,\" and I'd \"already made up my mind before I tried it.\" That's made trying new foods as an adult SO anxiety-provoking that I can only handle it under very specific circumstances. It doesn't help that people talk about picky eaters like they're out kicking puppies. Trust me, I'd rather not be picky, but I can't help it if my brain says \"this isn't food\" and makes me gag.", "I mean, she probably made it worse, because now you likely have trauma (and a trigger response) to unappetizing food being placed in front of you.", "I think I remember reading somewhere that kids have very sensitive taste buds and that's why they don't like foods like broccoli and Brussel sprouts.", "I *hate* chunks of tomato.

They ate everything and enjoyed it, until one day around age 3 when they just didn't believe in food anymore.  For a few years after that, meals were basically a ritual sacrifice that I would prepare, present, and throw away.  And then after a while they started to come back around, and now they're older kids who eat pretty well again.", "I am so curious as to why this happens.

Is it the budding influence of peers or the media? \n\nI was a somewhat picky eater as a kid, but in my case while my mom is a decent cook, let\u2019s just say vegetables were never her forte. Most of my early experiences with vegetables were of mushy, sad, under seasoned afterthoughts. Since I\u2019ve discovered that vegetables can be delicious, I\u2019ve often just assumed that picky kids were (understandably) picky because their parents, like mine, set a bowl of unsalted, steamed Brussels sprouts in front of them and got confused when they said \u201cyuck\u201d.

However, we shouldn\u2019t be compelled into treatment simply because others don\u2019t like the way we eat, and demanding treatment dismisses the fact that it doesn\u2019t always work and not everyone has access to it.
