We've had a very long engagement (3 years now) because we are paying for our wedding ourselves, and we wanted to take time to save up enough money to have the wedding of our dreams. I know that the wedding isn't everything, of course, and we are both so excited to be getting married regardless, but we figure since we only plan on doing this once, may as well go all out!\n\nNow, my fiance and I both work in animal sciences and have always had a taste for the macabre. We've planned our wedding to have a sort of \"dark nature\" theme; our ideal decor includes lots of moss, mushrooms, dark flowers, even the occasional antler or skull (ethically sourced, of course! That's part of what makes them so expensive but we refuse to compromise on that). My dress is black, and I plan to walk down the aisle to Hozier's \"Like Real People Do.\" We've booked a venue in a nearby national park and plan to have the ceremony deep in the forest with a reception at a nearby pavilion. Of course, my fiance and I acknowledge that our taste is weird and not what most people would do for a wedding, but we've talked long and hard about it and this is what we want.\n\nOur friends are all excited with us, but the issue comes from both of our mothers. I'm the only daughter in my family and my fianc\u00e9 is the only child in hers, so our mothers have both been excited to plan \"their perfect wedding.\" Unfortunately, they disapprove of almost every decision we've picked, and it has caused quite a few arguments. My fianc\u00e9's mother has gone as far as to call my fiance crying about how she's \"ruining her only chance to plan her daughter's perfect wedding.\"\n\nNow, our theme is important to us, but not as important as our family's. Our friends have encouraged us to not back down and stick up for what we want, but neither of us want miserable mothers. WIBTA if I tell the collective moms that this is what we've decided on? Would it be easier just to change a few things?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For those who asked about accessibility: the ceremony venue is less than 10 minutes walk down a paved, level path, and the park provides golf carts we can use if necessary.

So we decided to get married in my hometown. We were quite broke and decided it would be \"only close family\", i.e. my parents, his mother, my brother, his brother who would drive MIL, our witnesses (we needed witnesses back then), that's it. Then my mother said, oh, but your aunt really wants to be there! I love my aunt, so I said ok. Then it was \"your grandfather wants to be there as well!\" Then came the \"xyzzy wants to be there, they love you so much!\" And finally \"I'm going to pay for it!\" \n\nWe caved. We were young, broke, and, honestly, everyone she invited were people we loved. So we caved. Know what? The moment she said \"I''ll pay for it!\", she took over. It was like... I don't know. It did not feel like our Wedding, at all. I even got the SilentTreatment^(TM) the next day because we dared to finish the 1,5-liter-bottle of (true) Champagne my brother got us with my brother that night. It was horrible.

You want to be able to look back on the day with no regrets, which you guys might have if you let your mothers change it to what they want. Tell them both they can give their opinions & you guys will consider them , but at the end of the day you're in charge and plan to have the wedding of your dreams.", "NTA.\n\nThey had their days. \nThis one is yours. (& it sounds positively stunning!!!)", "Holy cats NTA and please share pictures to the extent that you're comfortable doing that!!!", "NTA your wedding sounds amazing! Guests will love how different it is.  get the mums involved in things such a menu tasting or cake tasting - still the fun wedding bits but perhaps a bit more \u2018normal\u2019. Or help with favours, choosing the wine etc. Take a picnic and walk to the spot you\u2019ll get married with them so they can how beautiful it is.", "This sounds so cool! NTA", "Your wedding theme sounds brilliant! \nCan I come?\n\nThere have been some great suggestions in how to include your mums already.\n\nNTA", "NTA for wanting what you want. Would you be willing to let the moms help with the actual wedding? Then you and your wife stick to your theme for the reception? Just a thought. But regardless it is your special day and I hope you enjoy it.", "NTA \nYour mothers already had their weddings, they don't get a say here.", "NTA. They suck for wanting to plan \"daughter's perfect wedding\" and not wanting that to be *your* vision of perfect. It's ridiculous to think someone else's celebration which they are paying for should be tailored to your ideal over theirs.", "Omg! Dream wedding! NTA, please don\u2019t change a thing.", "This sounds amazing! Pls post an update with a few photos as I would love to see how it turns out. I wouldn't change anything as the day belongs to you 2 and your wants and likes. I'm thinking they are hoping for more light, girly maybe slightly princessy wedding ideas. But you guys do you. NTA", "Wish you a beautiful wedding and an happy married life. Just small input, my only friend who didn\u2019t got a whitish dress dyed really young. At the time of the wedding, her red color dress made me feel uncomfortable but I was young and just thought she was being bold and unconventional. I would suggest you keep your theme but lightened it so love and engagement would be the maim theme of your wedding.\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe mothers want the wedding to be as their dreams. They need tp realize it's your wedding", "NTA and I just want to mention your wedding theme sounds absolutely stunning! My partner and I are planning our own wedding in October as well (two years out for us) and we\u2019re also trying to incorporate moss and some dark-ish colors too. Your wedding is supposed to be a celebration of the love and union of two people with guests. Generally for any party, the people it\u2019s for get to decide the theme, not the guests. So don\u2019t change anything there. If anything, I find it super unfortunate that the moms are more focused on not getting to have your wedding their way instead of focusing on being happy that you and your fianc\u00e9 are happy.", "INFO: is there anything you can let them plan? Like any parties or events where there isn't a fixed theme that you don't mind them doing? That way, they'll get the chance to have some semblance of their ideal wedding, but it won't clash with your amazing idea.", "NTA if your mother's want in on the planning, they get in on the theme or shut up. From an Aunty who really didn't want any part of a redneck theme wedding. But shut her mouth (except for once), to support their niece. You get one time to say your piece and then you shut up and help. No going around and making things harder.", "Nta \n\nIt's sounds like you have both put alot of yourselves into this wedding\n\nDon't change a thing unless you want to\n\nAnd congratulations", "NTA. Mothers don't want to plan your perfect wedding but theirs. This day should be about you and fianc\u00e9.", "NTA, I made compromise after compromise for my wife's parents and still regret it 12 years after the wedding. I'm not saying I didn't ultimately enjoy the day, but it wasn't what either of us wanted and was done to keep her father happy.\n\nIt might not be to everyone's taste but it's YOUR day, your parents already had theirs, they don't get to dictate yours too.", "NTA\n\nDo not bend.\nOtherwise, it won't stop there.", "You've already planned your perfect wedding though. They want to plan *their* perfect wedding for themselves as mothers of the brides. Your wedding sounds so cool. I wish I were one of your friends, I'd love to go to such an awesome wedding. NTA", "I know several women who ended up with the wedding their mother wanted and have regretted it. \n\nYou mention your family are important to you. Why aren\u2019t your wants for your special day important to them?", "*Sigh* I\u2019ll never understand why parents feel like they get to have a say in anything about their child\u2019s wedding.  Especially if they\u2019re not even paying for anything.", "NTA.\n\nIf you are ruining 'their perfect wedding' maybe they should marry each other.\n\nIts your wedding day not theirs, its supposed to be about you.", "Definitely NTA and is it too late to ask for an invite. This sounds like one of the best weddings themes I have heard of. Like it sounds soo beautiful the way you described it that I can almost see it. For both mothers if you can give them something to plan, if you like, like a wedding shower, rehearsal or something like that. But please don't change a thing. Also I'll be following you just incase you post some pics from the wedding.", "NTA. It is your wedding. If this is what you and your fiance want then absolutely go for it! It'll be a unique wedding that people will remember! \n\nOn a side note: LOVE the theme! I would be like your friends and say don't back down because that sounds like so much fun!", "Your theme sounds great. And if you back down you will always resent not having your dream day. I wish we were mates so I could come. Enjoy!", "NTA that\u2019s the coolest god damn wedding theme I have ever heard in my life!", "YWNBTA The time to plan their perfect wedding was whenever they got married. If they want so badly to plan a perfect wedding maybe they should have a wedding or vow renewal of their own", "NTA\n\nYour wedding will be perfect when you do it the way you want it. I actually love your theme, it is creative and personal.   \nIf mum and MIL want a traditional all white wedding they can always get married themselves or renew their vows. They shouldn't pressure you in changing YOUR wedding into something they want.", "NTA. I bet loads of your responses on this will be \u2018can we come? Sounds fab\u2019.", "You and your fianc\u00e9e are planning your perfect wedding. Your Mums have realised that your not the little princesss they wanted and are fighting back for their dreams, think Princess Beatrice or Catherine and William. Sadly for them it\u2019s not their wedding. Have you both sat down together with them and looked at ideas as a group? Have you explained your going for Dark Fairy ? They might get that and is there room for any of their ideas? Obviously your not teenagers who need Mum to plan everything, did they have their Mums plan their weddings? If so it\u2019s a generational thing that is now mostly over. As your willing to look at a few compromises for a happy wedding with family support I think a proper sit down over beverages or drinks and compare notes is a way to move forward.", "NTA; unless they're paying for it then they get to make 0% of the planning decisions, and even then it's ultimately your big day.\n\nYour wedding sounds awesome; hope you have a wonderful day! (And follow up with some photos of the venue/decor if you feel confortable as I'd love to see how it turns out).", "NTA\n\n*This* is your MIL's daughter's perfect wedding. They don't care what you want, they are throwing tantrums because they aren't getting *their* perfect wedding.\n\nWell, tough. I'm assuming they've both had their own weddings. If they want to throw a wedding suited to their desires, they need to marry / remarry / throw a vow renewal.\n\nBut this is *your* day. Don't throw it away on people being selfish. I've attended a wedding similar to what you're describing and it was the most fun wedding I've ever been to. Everyone had an awesome time. You've waited a long time for this, enjoy it.", "NTA.  It is your wedding and your choice.  Both mothers are either on board or do not have to come.  It\u2019s not their wedding and not theirs to interfere with.", "Can I give a mom perspective?  \n\nFirstly they are most likely more traditional in their thinking and also will have come into this with a vision in their minds. Secondly they will rob ably be asked for photos by their friends, work colleagues etc and may be worried about negative reactions.  \n\nNone of this means I think you should change your theme, I just wanted to give an idea of where they are coming from.    I\u2019d acknowledge that it may not be the day that they had imagined but remind them that but will be a day filled with love and happiness and that you know that\u2019s what they want for you.  \n\nAsking them to plan a couple of the pre and post wedding events is a great idea.  Wishing you all the best", "I don\u2019t think OP should compromise on a black wedding dress. \n\nI would counter and say, let the moms each influence outfits for you both and do an engagement photoshoot. Then they have alternative photos if they find the ones from your wedding too offensive.", "Do not give up this wedding theme, and do bot let your mothers plan this weeding. This is YOUR wedding. NOT theirs. \n\nYour wedding sounds amazing and exactly like what I've envisioned if I could redo my wedding. Absolutely perfect and gorgeous. \n\nYou need to sit your mothers down and explain that their dreams of your wedding day is over.\n\n That your paying for this and you will plan it without their input or opinions. That if you give them two options for their opinions, that's all you want an opinion on. Not what they think you should do instead. \n\nYou need to let them know that they are done crying over your wedding. You have the right to plan it to your taste and that's it. No more opinions, or demands, or trying to take over. \n\nThey need to sit by and allow you to plan this how you like and be happy for you. If they can't then they don't need to come. \n\nThe day after brunch is a nice idea. But you need to be really worry that they will get together and try to turn it into a second wedding reception, with the whole families and friends. \n\nSo you might want to curb that thought process.", "Let one mom do a rehearsal dinner and the other mom do a morning after brunch and let them pick outfits for those.\n\nAlso, anything you can do to let them \"in\" that you're comfortable with- like the menu, drinks, guest list, seating chart, picking prelude music, family dances music, or shopping with you, let them do that.\n\nJust have your friends work on the signs/table decor/florals.", "They do that in Poland and it's a blast! It's called the poproveina, or something like that.", "This is a good compromise. They are trying to inflict their own 'perfect wedding' on you with no considerations as to what you enjoy. This is for you, do you.", "NTA. Your wedding, your special day, your theme. They can get over it. You and your wife have to love it, they don\u2019t.

Personally I would do that before offering the rehearsal/day after planning, as another person suggested, to reaffirm that their preferences day of aren aligning with yours.

Is it level or are they climbing a hill to get there?\n\nThat said, so long as it isn't impeding people's ability to get there or you have a plan for the people who won't be able to walk that far, do what you want.  I also agree with the folks that are saying that the mothers should get another event to plan.", "Yeah, I'm not at all convinced this is mom's motivation but this plan is not well thought out for anyone with a disability or who can't walk long distances.", "Poprawiny, and yeah, it is like a second reception, but with hangover people in a bit less formal attire.  \n(not a fan of those personally)", "Everyone has been informed, yes! We don't have any guests with mobility issues. The path is straightforward and level, and the park labels it as wheelchair and walker accessible (though we don't have any guests using them).
