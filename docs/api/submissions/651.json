Before she comes, she asks for me to do her homework again, stating how she wants it done before x time because she wants to go get drunk with her friends and wanted to smoke before so she could be crossed. I\u2019m like ok, she\u2019s an adult, who am i to say no? \n\nShe comes over and first thing when I open the door she\u2019s on her phone.

We smoke, i start working, and I start trying to be friendly and make conversation, but she\u2019s ignoring me to take pictures of herself on he phone or text or friends. She then asks if her arm should feel numb.

She's obviously been using you. She supposedly thinks you laced it with something and instead of getting tested, does nothing for a week... then comes over and basically accuses you, even though the idea to smoke was hers.. THEN EXTORTS you into doing all her work?! She planned this and is obviously setting you up for something MUCH WORSE. She could easily detail you life with a sexual assault claim that you'll carry around forever. You are young, SHE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND! I would warn others even,  let my suspicions be known so hopefully it's harder for her to do to someone else. Avoid her, make up reasons if you have to. Also, why is she supposedly the only one who had a reaction?! I think she made that up and waited a week because a test would've proven your innocence. Please Avoid this manipulative Extorting asshole!", "NTA at all, she sucks.\n\nBut PSA - No one is putting fentanyl in weed. It makes no financial sense. Fentanyl is way more expensive and has a higher profit margin than cannabis flower. It's important to be smart about your source for any drug you want to ingest, but of all the things to worry about with cannabis (pesticides, mould, etc), fent isn't one of them.\n\nI'm a reporter and my beat is drugs. Every report of fentanyl-laced flower we've investigated has come from relatively clueless police departments (or, very occasionally, inexperienced albeit well-meaning public health workers) who panicked and pulled the trigger too fast on a press release, and every one has been unsubstantiated once the actual lab tests come back.", "So she comes over, smokes your weed, has you do her homework, and while high says/does stuff she wouldn\u2019t do if she were sober.
