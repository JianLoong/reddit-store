{"id": 4892, "submission_id": "znj4bi", "title": "AITA for being frustrated that my friend made me miss an appointment because he drove SUPER slow?", "selftext": "EDIT: I would like to point out that I did say I am frustrated with him *as well* not exclusively. \nI know I would have been late regardless, and the dr may not have seen me due to my own actions. My question is, am I TA for being frustrated with him *as well* for driving *excessively* slow, knowing there was a time issue. I know I worded this wrong as if I completely blame him for my missed appointment, that\u2019s my bad. \n\nI (32f) am disabled and driving long distances is painful for me, so I avoid it when I can. \n\nI had a Dr appointment that was a 48 minute drive from my house. I have a friend (35m) who is currently out of work and mostly doing doordash, so I offered to pay my friend to drive me, in my car, to this appointment. \n\nSo GPS says the appt is 48 minutes away, we leave 50 minutes before the appointment. (Yes, as many people pointed out, we were already running late, yes, that is my fault)\n\nJust over half way there, we get pulled over because my license plate wasn\u2019t displayed correctly, (yes, this delay is also my fault, I know this) the cop says he is gonna give a warning, and while the cop was running his license, I check the time to see if I need to call the dr. (Since this is the first delay I am aware of) This is when I realize we are ALREADY LATE and still 20 minutes away! (As in, we have taken twice as long to get to this point as expected)\n\nI started paying closer attention to their driving at this point, and dude is driving consistently 10-15(at one point 25) miles UNDER the speed limit\u2026 this frustrated me. I didn\u2019t say anything to him about his driving, but there was obviously frustration in my voice and body language. I called the dr at this point, hoping they would still see me(their usual policy is they will take you if you arrive within 15 minutes, yes this is gracious, and yes I know I\u2019m the AH to my doctor and the other patients for taking advantage of this policy, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking about). I look over at one point and see that he\u2019s going 25 miles under the speed limit, and I say \u201cyou really gotta go [the speed limit] on the Highway\u201d. \n\nSo, of course the Dr won\u2019t see me at this point, (I would\u2019ve been like 30 minutes late), and advises I try urgent care. I quickly look up the closest one and redirect him to go there. \n\nWe go to two urgent cares, no one will take me. I give up and say \u201cjust take me home\u201d.\n\nI did NOT yell or say much of anything to him. I was frustrated, trying to juggle things, and that was clearly in my voice and body language. I called my partner at one point and had him help me calm down when I started crying outside one of the urgent cares (i cry when I\u2019m frustrated) but I didn\u2019t really say anything to my friend. We had an awkward silent car ride, till about half way home, when he finally turned to me and said he was triggered by being pulled over (he is white, and it was a warning so, idk), and then told me a story about how he used to have car rides with his asshole father who would basically yell the whole time, so he was triggered when he heard frustration in my voice. I basically apologized and excused it as being frustrated cuz of a lot of things (ie. the health problems I was going to the Dr for) and hormones, that I wasn\u2019t upset with him. Which is all (mostly) true.\n\nBut, I WAS/am frustrated with him as well. It was very irritating that he would agree to take me to an APPOINTMENT and then have no urgency in actually getting me there on time. I do not understand why someone would do that. He probably just wasn\u2019t paying attention, but that\u2019s part of the frustration. \n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken really since last night, a cordial goodbye at my house, and a \u201cgot home safe\u201d text basically. \n\nAITA for being frustrated?\n\nSome things a lot of people have asked for: \n\nWeather conditions were clear skies, dry roads, no traffic, they could have have used cruise control. \n\nMy car is a Prius, nothing weird about it, it\u2019s in fine condition, and has a digital MPH display, my license plates were on my dashboard and current, I just haven\u2019t been capable of attaching them, yet, (my partner is fixing this, tonight). \n\nI didn\u2019t notice how slow they were going, idk why that\u2019s so hard for people to believe. Maybe because they aren\u2019t used to driving long stretches of highway with ranches on both sides? I saw the occasional car speed by, but people go 40mph over the speed limit on that road all the time. When he was driving through town he sped through a school zone, when we got to the highway, I was breathing and leaning back to help my back pain. I have never driven with him like this before. \n\nEdit to add: I understand I was likely going to be late because of leaving late. I would not have been frustrated if we\u2019d been 10-15 minutes late, especially with being pulled over. I am frustrated because we were already 20 minutes behind what GPS said we should be BEFORE getting pulled over, and then continuing driving excessively slow.", "created_utc": 1671209179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znj4bi/aita_for_being_frustrated_that_my_friend_made_me/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you were supposed to be 28 minutes into the drive by then.  So either (1) he was driving not only 10-15 mph under the speed limit, but almost half the speed limit AND you didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d been in the car nearly an hour at that stage, OR (2) much more realistically, you actually left/got on the road a few minutes later than you thought and getting pulled over ate into your time more than you realized before you checked.  (2) seems a lot more plausible to me, so my sense is that you have only yourself to blame.

He did you a favor and turned up when you asked, when you needed him, did more than you asked and agreed to, you got him pulled over for a vehicle with improper tags you admit fault, but it's the drivers responsibility, he placed his trust in you, but it's his name that'll be on that stop as the driver. and then still got mad at him.", "My family all think I'm crazy with how much time I give myself to get to appointments.
