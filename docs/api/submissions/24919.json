Keep a record of the harassment. For those acquaintances telling you to not sue the driver and her father, ask them if it means they are willing to cover the cost?", "NTA - the parents are responsible for the damage done by their then 16 yo daughter.\n\nThey are trying to force you to let her/them get off scott free.  Don't let them.  Sue and get your replacement car AND damages.", "Info: why didn't you report it to the police if she fled the scene and to your car insurance?\n\nThey would have tracked her down and paid out for either repairs or towards a new car.", "NTA, sue them. It was underaged driving, a hit and run, and now they're harassing you.   \n\n\nTake records of everything sent to you, save all the voicemails, and add them to the suit.", "NTA. First, they all need to learn that actions have consequences. Instead of apologizing they are getting angry and all of that. And third that is the law and your right and you did nothing wrong so why should you be the one who pays for the consequences of their own actions.", "Stop contacting the parents. \n\nGo to small claims or Send the police the video for a hit and run and send your insurance the info to get paid out from your insurance claim.", "100% go through with it. Actions have consequences. You found out who it was - something law enforcement could do given leads, and they're not creepy stalkers (Well, not usually...).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou're financially damaged by the actions of someone else. It was an accident, but that doesn't mean you get off free because you're young or female or run away. There's a difference between a kid who accidentaly bumps into a wingmirror whilst walking and someone in control of a vehicle clearly not in enough control and hitting you causing damage to write off the vehicle. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey just don't want to pay out, understandable, and the daughter may have been scared enough by this to buck her ideas up and not be the cause of any further bumps etc ... but even so, you don't get to cause damage, run away and be all \"Phew, skanked out of that!\".", "Go through everything you need to. Police report etc. You have the proof, but start soon, sometimes there are statutory  time limits. Good luck.", "NTA sue them they've had enough time to put things right", "NTA\n\n>I've been getting messages from him and mutual acquaintances, stating I'm an asshole\n\nScreenshot those messages for your lawyer. Give your lawyer the video.  Sue the pants off of them.  Get your car replaced with that money.\n\nShe hit your car and ran away.  She broke the law and her dad is trying to intimidate you into dropping it.  Don't let it work.  You are in the right.", "NTA. I would give them one last choice (on record); pay the damages through insurance or we see either other in court. Plain and simple.\n\nQuestion; how are the laws over there? Here (NL), if you flee from an accident it's considered a punishable offence. If you do, you have 12 hours to still report yourself at the police as a sort of cool down period in case you got scared, with the exception if you left someone on a scene that needed medical attention, than it's instantly a punishable offence.", "This is BS", "Info: When you figured out who she was, why didn't you report it to the police? Did you actually go knock on their door??? Cause that is pretty odd.", "NTA. Sue them and share all the messages he sent you with the court that all but admit liability.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If the police were actually involved, they would have been able to at least view the footage and advise the garage to keep a copy of it.  That's bare minimum.  The police most likely would have obtained a copy for their own investigation.", "Your car must have been in pretty bad condition to begin with if the damage from a minor hit would cause more damage than it was worth.  I'm curious how you found the girl after seeing her face for a few seconds.", "An older car with very few issues can still be totaled with a minor accident just because the body damage is worth more than the KBB."]}
