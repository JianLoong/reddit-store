He wanted a pistachio cake, but nobody in our family likes it. So I agreed with him that the biggest cake that would be at the party would be a chocolate cake while he would have a pistachio cake saved in the freezer just for him.\n\nThe party took place in our backyard, the whole family was there and the kids had a great time. We sang happy birthday to my son and went to cut the cake. While my mother-in-law and husband distributed the cake slices, I took my son inside and cut a big slice of his cake so he could eat it. The cake I bought for him was the size of a bento cake, so it would be enough for a todler. \n\nWhen we left, my sister-in-law who is also a mother looked at my son's plate and saw that his cake was different. She was surprised and asked where this other cake was, because she and her daughter wanted to taste it. I replied saying that I couldn't share because this cake was just for my son, as he doesn't like chocolate. She called me selfish for denying her and her daughter a slice, and after that, she commented to everyone at the party that I had another cake hidden at home. \n\nMany people ignored it, but some were curious and asked me why I didn't share the other cake. I explained the situation and still they kept calling me selfish. My husband and my mother-in-law told me I didn't do anything wrong, as I was resolving a situation with my son, but I'm still in doubt if I'm really right or I was an asshole.

Next year, I think you should go with that option if your son still wants a pistachio cake. \n\nBut, I also get annoyed when adults expect a child\u2019s birthday to be about their tastes and preferences instead of the child\u2019s. My niece likes vanilla a LOT more than chocolate but her first few birthdays had more chocolate because it\u2019s what other adults liked more (one year she had cupcakes in both but a cake in chocolate; a couple adults also preferred vanilla so those few cupcakes went quickly).

You are teaching your son that it is kind to provide everyone with something they like (the chocolate cake) but that it is also okay to have some things just for yourself (the pistachio cake).

The only exception to this would be allergies of course, like having a small package of nut-free cake.", "Next time, go with a variety of cupcakes including pistachio and get the same size cake you did this year for his candles (if that is part of your tradition). Then everyone can get what they want.\n\nMy niece did this for her wedding in lieu of a wedding cake and it worked out well.", "ESH\n\nI disagree with the majority of responses. The reason you got your son a different cake isn't due to food allergy. It's because he likes a special kind of cake. So you served him one thing (and hid that cake inside) and served everyone else at the party something else.\n\nNow granted, I wouldn't have pitched a fit over it like your SIL did or raised a stir at the party after, but I think that seeing the birthday boy being offered some special different cake from everyone else is going to arouse curiosity. It would be only natural that other kids might ask if they could try a little bit. Some adults, too. And even though you have predetermined that no one will like pistachio (admittedly not the most popular flavor compared to chocolate), I think next year you should have a small cake available for the entire party, rather than it being a secret thing in the kitchen just for your kid. \n\nI have to eat gluten free, and my mother makes chocolate cupcakes for parties and gluten free vanilla cupcakes that I can eat, but she doesn't tell everyone else in the family that those are only for me or hide them in the kitchen and only bring me one. When I invite people over, some of the things I bake are gluten free for me and some have regular wheat flour but I just offer everything up. If people would like to try the delicious GF goodies I've made, great! That's part of being a good host.", "I have to say ESH. It\u2019s totally uncalled for for SIL to make a big scene and tell everyone about the cake. She should have just let it go and not said anything to others. But I also do think it\u2019s a bit rude to have a cake at a party that only your son is allowed to have. Why couldn\u2019t you just have two cakes out and let people pick?

Not required by any means, but if you are hosting, there are some protocols that should be considered.", "It\u2019s like serving the guests Budweiser cans and drinking long neck imports.

This was a small, special cake for a young child who agreed to have a cake he didn't even like as the main attraction at his own birthday party so everyone else could be happy. This isn't like only having steak for yourself at a barbecue; it's like what it is. Showing up at someone else's birthday celebration and getting angry that they got special treatment.

What if the kid was allergic to gluten and had his own (more expensive) gluten-free cake? Should he have to share still?", "If both the cakes were kept, people would take a piece of pistachio cake, not like it and throw it away wasting most of it. Instead of that he can have a cake for himself on HIS OWN BIRTHDAY. \n\nHe should be allowed to enjoy his own birthday eating cake with everyone else, he shouldn't be sent away if he dosen't want to share his cake. \n\nThe other guests has chocolate cake, it's not like there wasn't anything else.", "Not to be confused with lardarse which has a different meaning all together. You can however be a mardarse AND a lardarse...", "Special treatment to me is getting the first slice, getting to go first in party games, being sung to and made a fuss over. I don\u2019t know why it has to include a special secret cake that no one else is welcome to have. That\u2019s not being a good host IMO. If you don\u2019t want to share, don\u2019t eat it in front of others when they\u2019re guests at your home. Especially children. That\u2019s basic courtesy to me.", "OP doesn\u2019t have to make a HUGE cake if she knows many won\u2019t like it. Make a small one and save a slice for later like I said. And if most won\u2019t eat it anyway, why not put it out? Most will be saved for the kid later anyway. Yes, if my kid was gluten free, I\u2019d make sure there was enough for him and offer some to others. I would feel super awkward letting my kid eat something in front of others without offering them any.", "Lol I JUST said he should not be sent away. I\u2019m not going to discuss anymore bc you are ignoring what I just said.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Very valid point!", "But they got cake too. Are you purposely forgetting that part? To OP making a fuss over her kid including having a special cake for him. It\u2019s no different than 1 yr olds getting a smash cake to themselves. Again you sound entitled.", "This cake was not for a separate purpose like a smash cake. I don\u2019t see that as the same at all. I also don\u2019t see a chocolate cake as being identical to a pistachio cake. If OP wants to make a separate cake for her kid and not offer any to anyone else, that\u2019s her prerogative, and if I was at this party I would certainly never say anything about it. I\u2019m just saying, where I come from this is considered poor manners and poor hosting etiquete.", "Yes it was for a separate purpose lol. So the birthday boy could have what he likes and keep the guests content. They got cake. Poor manners is feeling you deserve someone\u2019s food and voicing your demands. Entitled.", "Obviously it didn\u2019t keep the guests content lol. And yes, that\u2019s why I said the SIL sucks. She is entitled and demanding. And OP has poor manners"]}
