He wanted a pistachio cake, but nobody in our family likes it. So I agreed with him that the biggest cake that would be at the party would be a chocolate cake while he would have a pistachio cake saved in the freezer just for him.\n\nThe party took place in our backyard, the whole family was there and the kids had a great time. We sang happy birthday to my son and went to cut the cake. While my mother-in-law and husband distributed the cake slices, I took my son inside and cut a big slice of his cake so he could eat it. The cake I bought for him was the size of a bento cake, so it would be enough for a todler. \n\nWhen we left, my sister-in-law who is also a mother looked at my son's plate and saw that his cake was different. She was surprised and asked where this other cake was, because she and her daughter wanted to taste it. I replied saying that I couldn't share because this cake was just for my son, as he doesn't like chocolate. She called me selfish for denying her and her daughter a slice, and after that, she commented to everyone at the party that I had another cake hidden at home. \n\nMany people ignored it, but some were curious and asked me why I didn't share the other cake. I explained the situation and still they kept calling me selfish. My husband and my mother-in-law told me I didn't do anything wrong, as I was resolving a situation with my son, but I'm still in doubt if I'm really right or I was an asshole.

Next year, I think you should go with that option if your son still wants a pistachio cake. \n\nBut, I also get annoyed when adults expect a child\u2019s birthday to be about their tastes and preferences instead of the child\u2019s. My niece likes vanilla a LOT more than chocolate but her first few birthdays had more chocolate because it\u2019s what other adults liked more (one year she had cupcakes in both but a cake in chocolate; a couple adults also preferred vanilla so those few cupcakes went quickly).

Then everyone can get what they want.\n\nMy niece did this for her wedding in lieu of a wedding cake and it worked out well.", "ESH\n\nI disagree with the majority of responses. The reason you got your son a different cake isn't due to food allergy. It's because he likes a special kind of cake. So you served him one thing (and hid that cake inside) and served everyone else at the party something else.\n\nNow granted, I wouldn't have pitched a fit over it like your SIL did or raised a stir at the party after, but I think that seeing the birthday boy being offered some special different cake from everyone else is going to arouse curiosity. It would be only natural that other kids might ask if they could try a little bit. Some adults, too. And even though you have predetermined that no one will like pistachio (admittedly not the most popular flavor compared to chocolate), I think next year you should have a small cake available for the entire party, rather than it being a secret thing in the kitchen just for your kid. \n\nI have to eat gluten free, and my mother makes chocolate cupcakes for parties and gluten free vanilla cupcakes that I can eat, but she doesn't tell everyone else in the family that those are only for me or hide them in the kitchen and only bring me one. When I invite people over, some of the things I bake are gluten free for me and some have regular wheat flour but I just offer everything up. If people would like to try the delicious GF goodies I've made, great! That's part of being a good host.", "I have to say ESH. It\u2019s totally uncalled for for SIL to make a big scene and tell everyone about the cake. She should have just let it go and not said anything to others. But I also do think it\u2019s a bit rude to have a cake at a party that only your son is allowed to have. Why couldn\u2019t you just have two cakes out and let people pick?

This was a small, special cake for a young child who agreed to have a cake he didn't even like as the main attraction at his own birthday party so everyone else could be happy.

I understand that\u2019s not what happened but that\u2019s how it comes off.  I could understand something like this if it\u2019s allergy based but with this it wasn\u2019t.  Also with this age group 8 years old it can be explained but as something special for the birthday boy but it still comes off a little rude.

Not selfish, but I\u2019d be thinking of wether or not I\u2019d want to attend another party they held.  \n\nI also think that the main cake should have been to birthday boy\u2019s taste.  Who cares what the others like it\u2019s his birthday cake.  Be honest with yourself you (or your other kids/SO) didn\u2019t like his choice and wanted to be able to eat cake as well so you made this compromise so you (or other kids/SO) could have cake and not disappoint the birthday boy.  Seriously I get it.  I make food or buy desserts that aren\u2019t to my taste all the time because it\u2019s what the kids want or the husband or guest.

Tell everybody that she wanted it so badly at your son's birthday so that's what she gets from now on. I'm just petty like that.", "It\u2019s just super weird to have a cake for two slices ? Why not take the chocolate cake and a smaller (but shareable) pistachio cake, serve your kid first and leave the rest for other to try? And worst case the left overs who have been for your kid the next day. I also find it selfish, but more like it\u2019s a very weird behavior, that would not even cross my mind.", "I\u2019m so surprised by the answers here. \nIsn\u2019t it rude to have special food hidden away at a party? \nSIL took it too far but your behaviour is quite strange as well.\nThe polite way would have been to have two cakes. I also believe your son would have been pleased to share his favourite cake. It\u2019s nice to see others like what we like. \n\nSo, ESH.", "NTA it\u2019s a birthday gift from you!\n\nDid they want him to share his gifts with them as well, too many entitled adult babies. \n\nOf all the hills to plant your flag, ugh.", "NTA but I would have just had pistachio cake for everyone. Birthday boy gets to pick the cake. If others don\u2019t like it they don\u2019t have to eat it. My youngest had pumpkin pie for his \u201cbirthday cake\u201d one year.", "It would have been far better to only have the one (pistashio) cake.  If people don't like it they don't have to eat it.  Another alternative would have been to wait until after the party to give your son his cake.  \n\nAll that being said, it was very rude for them to demand the cake and to trash talk you for not sharing.  I would go with NTA, but the drama didn't need to happen if you would have managed this a little better.", "So everyone likes pistachio after all?????\n\nWhat a strange complaint. Its as if the birthday boy isn\u2019t supposed to get his favorite cake even when his guests get their favorite. She also was incredibly rude to spread that around to spoil the party.  Perhaps she should be off future guest lists until she develops manners.", "NTA but next time just say fuck them and get a huge pistachio cake and they can deal with it.", "NTA at all -- the solution is probably to say 'well since everyone's so curious, we can have all pistachio cake for his birthday next year instead of chocolate.'\n\nIt is bizarre they thought they should have this boy's special treat.", "ESH. Very soft you\u2019re the AH. On the one hand, yes, the toddler shouldn\u2019t have to share his little cake when there was plenty of chocolate cake for everyone else. But apparently you were wrong about everyone else not liking pistachio cake and you shouldn\u2019t assume. (Unless you know for a fact that they have tried pistachio cake in the past and disliked it, in which case you should have said so.) And if it wasn\u2019t a cupcake, but a small cake from which you cut a slice for the toddler, you could have cut a sliver so the two people who were curious could each have had a forkful. Who knows? Maybe the birthday boy isn\u2019t the only one who likes pistachio cake. But they were AH\u2019s, too, for not taking no for an answer. If they\u2019re so damn curious, they can go buy their own bento cake.", "NTA - next time don\u2019t get the chocolate cake.        \nOnly get the pistachio cake.       \nI hate pistachios but I believe the person who\u2019s birthday it is should choose the cake.        \nWhen they complain next year that there is no chocolate cake remind them they complained because the wanted pistachio cake.", "These adults are the AHS. Not you.", "NTA. Ug, is this one of those situations where everyone expects all kids to get presents at a birthday part? Birthday Boy gets special treatment. That includes cake.", "[removed]", "NTA - The pistachio cake was only big enough for the birthday boy. He should not have to share what little cake he had with entitled relatives. I'd think twice before I ever invited these complainers to a party I had again.", "Your not an AH but it is impolite.   Would it have cost that much more to get 2 cakes the same size?    I only say this because you could have served your kid liver and onions and everyone would have wanted some.   People are funny that way I've noticed.", "NTA it's your sons birthday not anyone else's honesty the fact you were willing to do a chocolate cake as well as your sons pistachio cake is already more than good enough. Honestly I'd have just brought the pistachio cake for everyone and not gotten chocolate at all.", "NTA\n\n\"I'm selfish, and you are no longer welcome here. Goodbye.\"", "Two cakes isn\u2019t uncommon especially if the child has a food allergy. I\u2019ve been to plenty of kids parties with two cakes because of that very reason. and i never once questioned or complained about getting whatever cake was presented to me because it\u2019s free fucking cake. what a weird hill to die on NTA", "NTA\n\nin fact your son agreed to a compromise and i'm proud of him. i know at 8 we assume kids will compromise but the fact that it seems he understood this compromise is nice. i really struggled with what a compromise was growing up so i'm also projecting.", "NTA.  I would have turned this on them. They are being selfish because none of them like what the birthday boy likes, but now that he has what he likes and you catered to their likes, they want a piece of his cake?  No!  They are being greedy pigs.  Your husband and MIL are right.", "NTA, but SIL is. What grown adult goes to a child's birthday party and accuses the host of being selfish over a cake flavor? She should be sitting at the kids table.", "NTA. \n\nThese adults sound very childish. Who on earth thinks they're entitled to try someone else's food?", "NTA it was your for your son and it was his birthday", "NTA but next year it's pistachio for everyone.  If they are going to call you ta, then earn the title the right way.", "NTA. But here is a solution for you. Next year get 2 cakes, 1 chocolate and 1 pistachio. Everyone who complained this year gets pistachio. No exceptions. Everyone else who likes it gets chocolate. If any pistachio eaters complain, say they had chocolate last year, this is their chance to try what the birthday boy likes. And if they don't like it they can leave and never come back!", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s an adult. She can go get a cake and try it herself without harassing an 8 year old.", "NTA. Pistachio cake sounds pretty good. I\u2019ll have to try one one day.", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Maybe you could have said it\u2019s a special present made for your son to escape those selfish twats.   \n\n\nPistachio is more expensive than chocolate. They shouldn\u2019t expect anything more other than a slice of the chocolate cake because it is a celebration for your son - he gets the limelight. If they are just appearing for a damn cake slice and feuding over another, that\u2019s them being cheapskates.", "You\u2019re SIL is a brat", "So what that they don't like pistachio cake? They can fucking eat it for one day", "Please send this post to your snotty sister so she and everyone else can see how ridiculous they\u2019re being.", " Your SIL\u2019s actions and behaviour over an 8 year old\u2019s birthday cake (\u2026I feel like the sentence can end there, lol,) \u2026was tacky and immature.\n\nNTA", "Wow!!! Are people really like this??? Such entitlement!!!", "Question, is this a common flavor in bakeries? Because now it's all I can think about. I may demand one for my birthday this year, lol.", "SIL is a bee-@tch...you made a perfectly reasonable accommodation for your son and I'm sure he'll appreciate it for years to come.", "LOL this is outrageous. NTA, most certainly.", "NTA, but you certainly didn't think this plan out well.\n\nYour sons birthday. Your son gets to pick the cake. The big cake, not the secret cake. Everyone else can eat it or not, but the main cake is for him. (And those who want to share in it)\n\nYou made a really simple situation awkward and unnecessarily confrontational. NTA, but think things through more next time.", "NTA.  Your son likes a flavor of cake that not everyone else does.  You went out of your way to cater to the other guests by providing the chocolate cake, but you stuck up for your son.  It was his birthday and he should have been able to enjoy his favorite cake.\n\nNext year, get two cakes again.  The biggest should be the pistachio cake.  When they complain they don't like the pistachio cake, tell them they can split the bento size chocolate cake between them.  If they complain, just say \"But last year, you complained that you didn't get pistachio cake, so this year I made sure everyone could have pistachio cake.  Now you're complaining about the pistachio cake.  In future, feel free to bring your own cake, because I'm only providing pistachio since it's the birthday boy's favorite.\"", "In what world would any guest confront the  host with being selfish by giving the birthday child their own cake? Not only SIL but others too? This is utterly confounding. Take them off the guest list for next year. \nNTA.", "I thought the issue was no one else liked pistachio, so a compromise was made. If the nut cake was for him to enjoy while everyone else enjoyed the chocolate cake, I fail to see the problem. NTA.", "NTA\nMy friend has a birthday party for her one year and... *GASP* she didn't serve cake. No one complained. Cake isn't required and it sure it's required to take a special cake from a child. Your sil is a huge AH just cause she wanted to \"try it\". She could've asked your son if auntie could try it and if he said no that's it. Don't start drama talking about a special cake.", "NTA.  \"That's right. There's another cake, and everyone got a slice but you. I specifically told everyone not to tell you.\"   \nShoulda just told her that it's something that he asked for specifically for a birthday present, and she's selfish for asking an 8 year old to share his birthday present.", "NTA\n\nI mean it seems a bit odd, but after having it explained it should be obvious to any reasonable adult. He doesn't like chocolate but nobody likes the cake he does like, so you bought a big chocolate cake for everyone else to be happy and a little pistachio cake for your son to be happy. I mean damn, nobody wanted the cake until they were told they can't have it and suddenly it's a big deal.", "Hahahaha @ people feeling entitled to cake. What the fuck. I\u2019m assuming this is in America, because, where else.", "NTA - no one is entitled to a different flavor of cake. You were nice to get them all chocolate as opposed to pistachio. If your SIL is so determined to get a taste of pistachio then send her a link so she can buy her own.", "NTA. Maybe it was selfish but who cares? Isn\u2019t the whole idea of a birthday party inherently selfish. \u201cHow dare you keep a cake just for your son on this day that is all about your son!\u201d", "NTA It is pretty common to have a separate, smaller cake for the birthday kid to dig into. They even do that at weddings pretty often. It seems bizarre that anyone would get angry over it. I understand inquiring about the cake (because honestly who doesn't want to try multiple cakes), but I don't understand the anger when you let them know it was just for your son.", "NTA,\n\nYour sister in law sure is the AH.\n\nHope the boy enjoyed his party.", "NTA. I've done similar things for my kids. Any parent should know you're NTA.", "Nta your sil is rude and entitled", "You are not the asshole. This is beyond strange. I mean his cake is a birthday gift! Why do these adults feel entitled to HIS birthday gift??!", "NTA, but take anyone who said you were selfish off next year's birthday party invite list.", "NTA - some people are just whacked. Who cares. I'm happy if I go to a party and get cake. Great. Move on", "NTA that said this outcome was predictable and one that couldve been easily avoided. You should've gotten a flavor cake that your husband would've had with the party. And then for the after party you enjoy the pistachio with him. Obviously when someone sees a next cake they will ask about it (not discussing if they are right or wrong but what behavior should be expected). Hope you learn better for next time.", "NTA", "nta", "NTA.  Kids have all kinds of special diets, for all she knew it was Ketogenic Gluten Free No Tree Nuts Fecal Transplant cake.

Who cares what they say or think. There was absolutely nothing wrong with what you did", "NTA. It's his cake, not their's.", "NTA", "NTA. Next time, if there is a next time have just a big Pistachio cake and when people complain tell them it\u2019s exactly what was asked for last year. Lol\n\nThe only mistake was maybe taking it out while other kids might still be around. Not wrong for doing it, but you could have saved yourself a headache. From now on just get a regular sized Pistachio cake and if nobody eats it, freeze it for your son for later.", "What the actual hell? You compromised and got a good chocolate cake for everyone, and gave your son something special. That's really nice. NTA. SIL needs to chill the fuck out.", "Eurghh, people\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nEntitled parents are exhausting.\n\nYou were thoughtful enough to get a crowd pleaser cake, pistachio isn't for everyone, particularly kids.

It's his birthday.", "Seriously, these are adults?!", "Who has this much time in their lives that they spend even more than a second on the thought after it was explained? I am truly jealous.

It\u2019s pistachio. \n\nLike. The kids palette is sophisticated enough to like pistachio cake.
