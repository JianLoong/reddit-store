He wanted a pistachio cake, but nobody in our family likes it. So I agreed with him that the biggest cake that would be at the party would be a chocolate cake while he would have a pistachio cake saved in the freezer just for him.\n\nThe party took place in our backyard, the whole family was there and the kids had a great time. We sang happy birthday to my son and went to cut the cake. While my mother-in-law and husband distributed the cake slices, I took my son inside and cut a big slice of his cake so he could eat it. The cake I bought for him was the size of a bento cake, so it would be enough for a todler. \n\nWhen we left, my sister-in-law who is also a mother looked at my son's plate and saw that his cake was different. She was surprised and asked where this other cake was, because she and her daughter wanted to taste it. I replied saying that I couldn't share because this cake was just for my son, as he doesn't like chocolate. She called me selfish for denying her and her daughter a slice, and after that, she commented to everyone at the party that I had another cake hidden at home. \n\nMany people ignored it, but some were curious and asked me why I didn't share the other cake. I explained the situation and still they kept calling me selfish. My husband and my mother-in-law told me I didn't do anything wrong, as I was resolving a situation with my son, but I'm still in doubt if I'm really right or I was an asshole.

Next year, I think you should go with that option if your son still wants a pistachio cake. \n\nBut, I also get annoyed when adults expect a child\u2019s birthday to be about their tastes and preferences instead of the child\u2019s. My niece likes vanilla a LOT more than chocolate but her first few birthdays had more chocolate because it\u2019s what other adults liked more (one year she had cupcakes in both but a cake in chocolate; a couple adults also preferred vanilla so those few cupcakes went quickly).

Then everyone can get what they want.\n\nMy niece did this for her wedding in lieu of a wedding cake and it worked out well.", "ESH\n\nI disagree with the majority of responses. The reason you got your son a different cake isn't due to food allergy. It's because he likes a special kind of cake. So you served him one thing (and hid that cake inside) and served everyone else at the party something else.\n\nNow granted, I wouldn't have pitched a fit over it like your SIL did or raised a stir at the party after, but I think that seeing the birthday boy being offered some special different cake from everyone else is going to arouse curiosity. It would be only natural that other kids might ask if they could try a little bit. Some adults, too. And even though you have predetermined that no one will like pistachio (admittedly not the most popular flavor compared to chocolate), I think next year you should have a small cake available for the entire party, rather than it being a secret thing in the kitchen just for your kid. \n\nI have to eat gluten free, and my mother makes chocolate cupcakes for parties and gluten free vanilla cupcakes that I can eat, but she doesn't tell everyone else in the family that those are only for me or hide them in the kitchen and only bring me one. When I invite people over, some of the things I bake are gluten free for me and some have regular wheat flour but I just offer everything up. If people would like to try the delicious GF goodies I've made, great! That's part of being a good host.", "I have to say ESH. It\u2019s totally uncalled for for SIL to make a big scene and tell everyone about the cake. She should have just let it go and not said anything to others. But I also do think it\u2019s a bit rude to have a cake at a party that only your son is allowed to have. Why couldn\u2019t you just have two cakes out and let people pick?

Not required by any means, but if you are hosting, there are some protocols that should be considered.", "It\u2019s like serving the guests Budweiser cans and drinking long neck imports.

This was a small, special cake for a young child who agreed to have a cake he didn't even like as the main attraction at his own birthday party so everyone else could be happy. This isn't like only having steak for yourself at a barbecue; it's like what it is. Showing up at someone else's birthday celebration and getting angry that they got special treatment.

I understand that\u2019s not what happened but that\u2019s how it comes off.  I could understand something like this if it\u2019s allergy based but with this it wasn\u2019t.  Also with this age group 8 years old it can be explained but as something special for the birthday boy but it still comes off a little rude.

Not selfish, but I\u2019d be thinking of wether or not I\u2019d want to attend another party they held.  \n\nI also think that the main cake should have been to birthday boy\u2019s taste.  Who cares what the others like it\u2019s his birthday cake.  Be honest with yourself you (or your other kids/SO) didn\u2019t like his choice and wanted to be able to eat cake as well so you made this compromise so you (or other kids/SO) could have cake and not disappoint the birthday boy.  Seriously I get it.  I make food or buy desserts that aren\u2019t to my taste all the time because it\u2019s what the kids want or the husband or guest.

Who the fuck do you associate with?", "NTA. For your SIL to have the audacity to be offended that she couldn\u2019t have something that was not intended for anyone else and go around talking about it to get everyone else riled up was super AH behavior. If she wants a pistachio cake you could just tell her where to go get it. It was a private cake for your son and if he wanted to share it with anyone it was his choice and his choice alone.", "NTA - I can\u2019t understand how grown adults are sulking about not getting a share of a kid\u2019s special cake\u2026 Christ\u2026", "NTA.  The others are being entitled and unreasonable.  You offered them a cake, they need to grow up.", "NTA This to me seems like a damned if you do damned if you don't type situation.

Not saying this is what you should\u2019ve done, but as now adults we get over it.", "NTA  \nYou went out of your way to provide your child with something special to him while also providing a cake to everyone else.  \nIf they want to try it, they can go buy one themselves.   \n\n\nYou're a great parent for what you did for your kid. A lot of parents would just not get the special cake", "Seriously, trying to mooch a cake slice??? Wtf is wrong with people thinking that they go to a party its a free for all for everything in the pantry. Everyone got cake.  Let the kid enjoy his special day.  Why would they even care?", "NTA. Your SIL is an entitled AH, however. Who demands something at someone else's house, then goes around dragging that person to the other guests because they didn't get their way? I wouldn't invite SIL to anymore gatherings at my house if I were OP.", "NTA I have a kid with food allergies and I hosted a party at Chuck e Cheese for him.

There will be lots of leftover cake for the birthday boy to freeze and save for later", "I agree. A pistachio cake with chocolate cupcakes for people who don't like pistachio, or a small but more exciting main pistachio cake and a chocolate sheet cake to cut and serve would be a more considerate way to do essentially the same thing.", "I love that word!\n\nThis situation definitely falls into the categoary of \"first world problems\". SIL and her child got chocolate cake they didn't need to have all the cake.
