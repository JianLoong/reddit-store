This was huge for us, as we both have always been really passionate about becoming parents.\n\nBefore we could tell anyone, my husband\u2019s brother (35M) and his wife (38F) told the family that they had been trying to conceive but found out they couldn\u2019t. (Apparently my SIL feared this due to past medical problems, but now it was confirmed by doctors.) They were devastated, and we were heartbroken for them. \n\nMy husband and I decided to hold off on announcing. We waited 3 months, but then I was starting to show and we no choice. \n\nA week after we announced, my BIL and SIL adopted a dog named Bella. Immediately she was all they talked about and they refused to go anywhere without her. \n\nWe used to be close, but this has ruined our relationships with them. My husband and his brother don\u2019t hang out anymore because my BIL is so obsessed with Bella that he\u2019s hard to talk to. (BIL\u2019s lost friends over this obsession, and SIL has quit her job so she doesn\u2019t have to spend any time away from the dog.) We even stopped our weekly family dinners because Bella barks non-stop, pulls food off the table, bites, etc. She\u2019s a nightmare. Plus my husband is allergic, and can\u2019t be around her for longer than an hour anyway. \n\nBIL and SIL call Bella \u201cthe first grandchild\u201d or the \u201cfirst [last name] girl\u201d (there hasn\u2019t been a girl born into the family in 5 generations), which bothers me because my daughter is those things\u2014 not the dog. \n\nThey think my daughter and their dog should be treated equally, and get upset when they are not. Even when I gave birth and people were reaching out to check on me and my daughter, they sulked and made a long post on FB saying they were hurt no one had done the same for them when they adopted their dog. \n\nI\u2019ve been biting my tongue about it for over a year because I know that they are coping with an extremely painful situation, but this week I finally snapped. \n\nRecently, a relative invited us and baby to their wedding, but told my in-laws explicitly not to bring Bella.\n\nOn Sunday, as my husband and I were just about to leave his parents house, I heard BIL say that if his dog wasn\u2019t invited, then my daughter shouldn\u2019t be either. \u201cWhy should they get to bring her if we can\u2019t bring Bella?\u201d \n\nThey say things like that all the time, but this time I finally snapped and said, \u201cBecause Bella is a dog, and my daughter is an actual human baby. My child and your pet are not the same.\u201d \n\nWe left, but later my BIL called my husband to say that I had really hurt them and made my SIL cry. My husband says that I shouldn\u2019t have said anything and should take it back. \n\nI know their dog is like their child, and I don\u2019t mean to be cruel or insensitive, but I am also so tired of hearing them compare my daughter to a dog, and I don\u2019t want her to grow up around people who think she is equal to a poorly behaved animal. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698808900, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17l34ke/aita_for_telling_my_infertile_inlaws_that_their/", "score": 3684, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are correct, your child is not the same as their dog, and they shouldn't be making that comparison or expecting their dog to be treated the same way as a human child. They legit need therapy.", "Fuck them and fuck your husband", "NTA i know this story is hard to believe but my MIL thinks her dog is equal to my daughter and it\u2019s honestly annoying and disrespectful.", "NTA, but it hinged quite a bit on how accurately you quoted the words you said and the situation in which they were said. \n\nI've known people who replace kids with dogs because they can't get pregnant and it's kind of a timebomb that blows up when the dog inevitably dies (at least in my experience). \n\nSounds like they need therapy to help them through such a tough emotional blow (and maybe also consider adoption?)", "NTA. Oh this is a sad case, but as much as we love our four legged friends, they are not equivalent of babies. You can leave your dog with a sitter, newborn babies need to breastfeed like every few hours. It\u2019s far more difficult to find adequate care to a new infant as opposed to a puppy. I do sympathize with them, they\u2019re clearly taken this dog on emotionally as a baby due to their inability to have one. So you have to be firm but gentle with this situation. Understand their frustration, but dogs just can\u2019t come everywhere. Some venues have rules barring pets and that might be a good excuse for them to understand. Also, dogs can be tripped over and stepped on or snap on someone and attack. They could also pee or poop in the venue and potentially ruin dresses, furniture, and other parts of the venue. I imagine they baby the dog so it\u2019s probably sweet but not well behaved. I feel so bad for them but they need to respect a no-pet decision at an event that has nothing to do with them. And stop comparing your human baby to a dog.", "NTA. People like your in-laws make dog owners look horrible. They need intense mental health treatment. Not a dog.", "So I need to share this because people are doubting that SiL & BiL could behave this way. \n\nI believe it because many years ago me and extended family would rent a beach house. My youngest SiL& hubby had no children but a lovely dog. The beach house did not allow pets. SiL planned on smuggling in their dog. When talking to my MiL about this she looked at me and said something to the effect, \u201cwell we\u2019re allowing your children.\u201d I\u2019ll be honest, I had no words because as much as I love dogs I do not think them the same as children. As I recall I stared at her for a moment and walked away. \n\nNTA and OP\u2019s SiL & BiL have big issues. And obviously other family members feel the same since they had to explicitly say Bella was not invited to the wedding. \n\nThe only person who should be apologizing is OP\u2019s husband  to OP - his child is not the same as a dog.

I can't imagine how that must feel. However, they're not doing Bella (or themselves) any favours by acting like she's human when she isn't.

It was their dog, and they wanted me to bring their dog inside my kids daycare when I picked them up. They got worse when they started trying for their second child and not having luck conceiving.

Sure it might not be the healthiest thing to go about things but that's just how they're dealing with their situation.\n\nBecause I know exactly how they feel.

You already won the grandchild competition here, there's no need to remind them.", "ESH. So you said they found out they were infertile. They got Bella to cope obviously. Are treating her like a baby, to cope, obviously. Not completely handling the situation well, obviously. You have no effing clue what they are going through, obviously. Do they need serious counseling, yes, when they are ready. It\u2019s not your business. No I don\u2019t think animals are the same as people but Bella is helping fill a void in their lives right now and maybe they aren\u2019t handling it the greatest but you know what, you were blessed with a child and they weren\u2019t and it\u2019s obviously affecting them very hard so don\u2019t judge so damn harshly! Your comments were wrong, you need to apologize and this is coming from someone who is known for intensely mean to people, but not without just cause.", "[deleted]", "ESH.\n\nI feel for them and they should probably look into grief counseling.\n\nThey also need to understand boundaries a bit better. Acknowledge that having a dog in place of a kid changes the game.\n\nAnd you need to be a little more resilient. Who cares if they call the dog the first granddaughter or whatever. That dog will live a fraction of the lifetime your daughter will (I hope). **To them**, their dog is just as special and loved and meaningful as your daughter is to you.\n\nIt does absolutely blow that they've trained Bella so poorly. That's not okay. And it will hold them back. And poor Bella.\n\nFor what it's worth:\n\nI can't have children and I have a dog. I love my dog more than I love just about any other person, I suppose (hard to quantify).\n\nShe's a dog though. Taking her to a wedding would be upsetting to her because it's too loud and chaotic. \n\nPretty much my life involves her though. I choose dog friendly events and venues over those that aren't. I have a strong preference for going to friend gatherings or events that are dog friendly. But! She can stay at home alone for a few hours and it won't kill her. She'll just sleep.\n\nI consider my dog when looking at jobs. My mom got me a mother's day gift (she's accepted this will be the only kind of grandchild she ever gets). We celebrate it in different ways.\n\nBecause I've had the time to and because it's just the two of us more often than not, I've had so much time to bond with my dog in a way I haven't with others that were family pets. All of her life is dependent on me. She's more than just a dog and she's not really a child, she's like my best friend that I get to hang out with most of my day. We go places that make her happy and do things we both enjoy. And sometimes I need to clean her ears and we both hate the whole ordeal. I've read so much about dog body language and behavior. She can't talk, and never will, but I've got a pretty good idea of how she's feeling any given time.\n\nI'll tell anyone and everyone about my dog if I could. She's very well trained and well behaved. I don't think she's the equivalent of a human child, but I do wish more public places were pet friendly. Communication with a child is better once they learn to talk and they can talk about what's upsetting them. I have to work to figure that shit out. She'll never be a teenager I can depend on to feed herself or go to the bathroom on her own if I'm away for an extended time. She'll be geriatric or dead by the time human children are doing those things.\n\nSo it's not equivalent, but it's not easy. And to me, she's not less valuable than a human child someone else has. People who love me get that. In return, I also understand it's not everyone's cup of tea. There are boundaries to be maintained. \n\nSo the ESH here is because they are being a bit \"extra\" and probably coping poorly about not being able to have kids. And they didn't train their dog well. And you could really exhibit more empathy in place of tolerance or sympathy.\n\n*Edit because I posted too soon.*", "YTA - They know Bella isn't a human baby.\n\nLet them take joy where they can find it.", "ESH - let me explain.\n\nIt seems the overwhelming response is NTA but I disagree. You are an AH, but so are they. Nobody in this situation is right, in my opinion.\n\nThey are clearly seeing the dog as a child due to some sort of grief around the infertility. As someone who calls her dog her baby, I get that mindset to a certain extent. But they are definitely taking it too far. If they want to treat the dog as a real child at home, that's fine, but sulking and getting upset when the rest of the world doesn't play along is ridiculous. Of course nobody else is going to play along, because although dogs are family, they're still dogs. They need therapy. They need to grieve over their inability to have children. They need to heal, and seeing their dog in this light is merely a temporary coping mechanism. It won't even be something that is sustainable.\n\nHowever, you're not free of guilt and I don't see why nobody else is pointing out the utter lack of communication and support between you all.\n\nYou put off your announcement out of courtesy for their heartbreak, but maybe I need some info because as far as I know from the post, that is the extent offered. Not only that, but from the beginning till now of their dog ownership, you've held back saying anything and simply let your emotions get stuffed and stew. And then you blew up and were incredibly harsh in what you said. This isn't healthy behavior either.\n\nThe better idea would be to sit them down and have a transparent, open, and long talk with them about it. Explain how their behavior is making you feel. And express your desire to help. And follow up on that desire. They could very well be stuck in the denial stage of grief, and might need a supportive hand to help them cross the gap. If others in the family feel similar frustrations, maybe ask them to join and hold an intervention of sorts.\n\nAnd by \"talk\" I do NOT mean you make assumptions about their emotions and thoughts. I mean use \"I\" statements about how you and only you are feeling, and then express to them your genuine concern for them, and offer to help them find a professional.\n\nAnd honestly don't be alarmed if it doesn't go that well. Some people can be defensive even if it's put lightly, especially on a topic such as infertility and grieving that perceived loss. If that happens, that still doesn't necessarily justify blowing up at them. I'd say at that point to tell them you're only concerned and want to help. And they are not obligated to reach out but that you are there for them and if they change their mind about getting help, you will still be willing. See if they don't contact you after they have time to calm down and think.\n\nMaybe even follow up one more time just via phone call or text a week or two later. If their response is still negative, THEN I'd say blow ups are unavoidable and understandable.\n\nThis might seem like a lot of tiptoeing and babying, but think about it. Put yourself in your shoes. You said you and your spouse were passionate about becoming parents, right? Imagine if one of you, or both of you, were infertile. And your dream of having your own child was shattered to pieces, just like that. One day there's hope and the next, in the span of one conversation with the doctors, that hope is entirely gone. Your options are adoption, a pet, or just never have either. But usually for people who really want their own children, none of those things can usually replace that dream sufficiently. Not to mention your in-laws having a child would surely make it worse, no matter how much time was given to grieve. It's human nature to be greedy and want what we don't have, especially if it's something we had wanted prior, so I'm sure there's some unresolved jealousy whether they realize it or not.\n\nI'm sure you'd be devastated, no? Even if you didn't try to cope by projecting your parental instincts onto a pet or something, it would surely affect you mentally at least for a time. Just try to put yourself in their mindset. I'm sure if that happened, you'd want support, understanding, and offers to help. Even if you became overwhelmed and emotional during from defensiveness, it would be the patience and kindness your family showed you during that time that would help you find your way again and it would be what you remember and are grateful for, for years to come.

Of course I recognize there are fundamental differences between humans and animals and they don\u2019t need or need to do everything we do, so I\u2019m not suggesting dogs or other animals be allowed to do and go everywhere.

This was huge for us, as we both have always been really passionate about becoming parents.\n\nBefore we could tell anyone, my husband\u2019s brother (35M) and his wife (38F) told the family that they had been trying to conceive but found out they couldn\u2019t. (Apparently my SIL feared this due to past medical problems, but now it was confirmed by doctors.) They were devastated, and we were heartbroken for them. \n\nMy husband and I decided to hold off on announcing. We waited 3 months, but then I was starting to show and we no choice. \n\nA week after we announced, my BIL and SIL adopted a dog named Bella. Immediately she was all they talked about and they refused to go anywhere without her. \n\nWe used to be close, but this has ruined our relationships with them. My husband and his brother don\u2019t hang out anymore because my BIL is so obsessed with Bella that he\u2019s hard to talk to. (BIL\u2019s lost friends over this obsession, and SIL has quit her job so she doesn\u2019t have to spend any time away from the dog.) We even stopped our weekly family dinners because Bella barks non-stop, pulls food off the table, bites, etc. She\u2019s a nightmare. Plus my husband is allergic, and can\u2019t be around her for longer than an hour anyway. \n\nBIL and SIL call Bella \u201cthe first grandchild\u201d or the \u201cfirst [last name] girl\u201d (there hasn\u2019t been a girl born into the family in 5 generations), which bothers me because my daughter is those things\u2014 not the dog. \n\nThey think my daughter and their dog should be treated equally, and get upset when they are not. Even when I gave birth and people were reaching out to check on me and my daughter, they sulked and made a long post on FB saying they were hurt no one had done the same for them when they adopted their dog. \n\nI\u2019ve been biting my tongue about it for over a year because I know that they are coping with an extremely painful situation, but this week I finally snapped. \n\nRecently, a relative invited us and baby to their wedding, but told my in-laws explicitly not to bring Bella.\n\nOn Sunday, as my husband and I were just about to leave his parents house, I heard BIL say that if his dog wasn\u2019t invited, then my daughter shouldn\u2019t be either. \u201cWhy should they get to bring her if we can\u2019t bring Bella?\u201d \n\nThey say things like that all the time, but this time I finally snapped and said, \u201cBecause Bella is a dog, and my daughter is an actual human baby. My child and your pet are not the same.\u201d \n\nWe left, but later my BIL called my husband to say that I had really hurt them and made my SIL cry. My husband says that I shouldn\u2019t have said anything and should take it back. \n\nI know their dog is like their child, and I don\u2019t mean to be cruel or insensitive, but I am also so tired of hearing them compare my daughter to a dog, and I don\u2019t want her to grow up around people who think she is equal to a poorly behaved animal. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yet, they insist on bringing the dog with them whenever they feasibly can. \n\nAt the family Thanksgiving last year they were explicitly told that the dog was not invited, yet they brought it any way, because they thought that after everyone saw the dog and got excited to meet her, the person hosting would change their mind about the dog going in the house.

Then, they gave my sister's in-laws a framed photo of the dog with \"Merry Christmas Grandma and Grandpa\" on the frame. \n\nThey insisted on bringing the dog to a (NOT pet-friendly) craft fair, then were indignant when they were kicked out after the dog kept jumping on tables and barking at people, because technically the dog is registered as an \"emotional support animal\", which means they think that people are \"discriminating\" against them if they don't like the dog or refuse to let it in their house. \n\nThey called my sister and BIL \"ableist\" and accused them of \"hating their niece\" after they told them that they couldn't bring the dog to my BIL's birthday party, or around their two dogs, since their dog is dog-aggressive. \n\nThey asked my BIL's cousins if they could go through their childrens' hand-me-downs to see if anything would fit the dog. \n\nAll in all, these all sound like people who had a vision for how their life would turn out, and when they realize that their vision was unlikely to come true they chose to try to get as close that vision as they could, rather than dealing with those negative emotions in a healthy and productive way. \n\nAlso, OP is NTA.

The dog was the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated. The domestication of the dog occurred due to variation among the common ancestor wolf population in the fight-or-flight response where the common ancestor wolves with less aggression and aversion but greater altruism towards humans received fitness benefits (similar processes applied to humans), and thus the domestication of the dog is a prominent example of social selection (rather than artificial selection). The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the Bonn-Oberkassel dog buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.  \n\n\n*Science suggests having a dog companion-  \nIncreases Physical Fitness. One of the most obvious benefits of owning a dog is the increase in physical activity. Dogs require regular exercise, such as daily walks or playtime in the yard.  \n\nHeart Health. Heart health is something that everyone should consider, as cardiovascular diseases affect nearly half of all adults in the United States.  \n\n\nStress Reduction. Animals have long been known to help lower your levels of stress. The National Institute of Health writes that interacting with animals reduces stress hormones.  \n\nMental Health Benefits. Along with physical benefits, dogs can also be a valuable asset for mental health. The emotional bond between humans and dogs is well-documented, and this connection can be especially beneficial for people dealing with mental health issues.  \n\nIncreased Social Interaction. Dogs are drawn to other dogs, which means their dog owners are coming along, too! Having your dog with you in a public place or even going for a walk in your neighborhood is a great conversation starter.  \n\n\nIncreased Physical Fitness. One of the most obvious benefits of owning a dog is the increase in physical activity.", "Just don't forget to bring the cat treat!", "Do you realize that when somebody who knows you spots you in the grocery store, they suddenly make an excuse to be very interested in the nearest nutritional label?
