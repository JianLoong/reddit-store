I have a hard time believing you use these things on a regular enough basis to warrant having them, and also work for an oilfield company, which is usually very quick to provide you with the tools needed to complete your job and then some. You took that picture to piss your brother off cause he pisses you off. You weren't doing him a favor in good faith and he probably knew there would be consequences to calling you up, but I imagine he didn't have other options at the time. Yes, we all have to use oil based products at one point or another in our life, but not everyone loves that part of their life and I imagine those people don't want it thrown in their face.
