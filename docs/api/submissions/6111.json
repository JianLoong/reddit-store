I'd do the same thing lol", "NTA - I honestly can't stand it when so-called \"environmentalists\" talk about their EVs and how much better they are for the environment because they clearly haven't done their research \ud83d\udc4c\n\nNext time he starts being a jerk about you working in the oil fields, ask him about the impact that the lithium mining fields are creating...if he doesn't know then he can shut up...and if he DOES then he is a hypocrite who can still shut up", "Nta. Lol this is funny though. You are awesome for helping out your bro regardless", "Not reporting you to the wives!! He\u2019s really pulling out the big guns.

Oil isn't going away anytime soon even if the entire planet switched to 100% renewable energy tomorrow we still need oil based lubricants, coolants, and plastics so there's no need to rag on people working in that field.

That\u2019s hilarious.", "Nta, that is hilarious. I would def post it on earth day.", "Honestly, NTA, this shit is mad hilarious but hopefully you see this message, even though it might get drowned by everyone else\u2019s. People are prideful, yeah it maybe funny now, but your brother may not call you for assistance next time and that might put his safety in jeopardy.

If I had award I would give it to you,  so please accept my humble upvote.", "Yeah. To me the fact that, once the bro needed to use the generator in an emergency (waiting 18 hours for help\u2026otherwise) is not a big deal and doesn\u2019t change the work he\u2019s out in to reduce his carbon footprint. I suppprt that and see no issue with it. \n\nThe issue imho is mocking each other. If it\u2019s a good natured joke fine. But if anyone\u2019s feelings are being bothered, then the joke is in poor taste. The lawyer brother should have stfu ages ago, agreed to disagree or whatever. Or, I don\u2019t know, recognize that he has personal choice and the privilege to afford to make it? So he sucks for mocking his brother. Immature. \n\nBrother is being a dick about the pictures, and is punching down. He is upset because he feels disrespected and put down by his older brother, so how is he better if he does the exact same thing?

Don't get me wrong, i dislike snobs (especially the \"im saving the planet\" type) just much as everyone else, but how is \"getting stuck in traffic until your electric car dies\" violating his intention to be environmentally friendly?
