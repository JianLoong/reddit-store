He is trying to be more environmentally friendly and drive electric. If he uses renewable / grid electricity 99% of the time and in an emergency will use a diesel generator, then that is still a lot less fossil fuel and emissions than driving petrol / diesel cars. You are both trying to outdo each other and getting each other more entrenched in your own views. It isn't helping the situation. Both of you need to give to each other a bit", "ESH, \"I'll delete the pictures if you stop making fun of my job\" seems like a fair compromise to me.", "NTA\n\nRelationships should be reciprocal. It sounds like he rags on you for working in the oilfield. If he's serious about that then he's being ridiculous. Getting off oil is a great goal, but dependence on oil is not going to end overnight no matter what. What you do for a living is perfectly valid. If he's not serious -- just ragging on you -- then he should know that shit flies both ways. \n\nNot only that, but if he's the big success story/golden child of your family (my family has one too) then he shouldn't be so damn insecure. He might be hard working and deserve his success, but he's still a lawyer making fun of your blue collar job. If him punching down is okay then you punching up is okay.", "YTA.\nYour brother was in a crappy situation and needed help.

You are creative and hats off to you!", "NTA; he seems like a hypocrite.", "Siblings are assholes to each other all the time. You specifically said you\u2019re not posting it and will bring it up if he gives you shit again. If he doesn\u2019t give you shit he doesn\u2019t see the pictures. My sister has done so much dumb stuff over the years and my brother is a cocky little shit and they both gave me hell growing up. If they do something that will give me a good self-righteous giggle you best believe I\u2019m saving it. I don\u2019t show it to anyone but we all have the \u201cremember when this happened\u201d and everyone has their turn getting made fun of.\n\nMost families aren\u2019t happy-go-lucky fully functional groups of people.

Don\u2019t post them but do enjoy the experience. And hopefully he chills out and stops being rude to you in future!", "Definitely ESH. The brother may be \"holier than thou\" but OP is really just as bad. Both are trying to find a way to be \"better\" than the other.\n\nOP, it might be worth considering that everyone who has done something to improve the world still had to live in the one they were born into. People who bought the first cars still rode horses. People who bought the first lightbulbs still used candles. That doesn't make them hypocrites - it makes them humans who only sometimes have access to the latest technology. Stop looking for a \"gotcha\" moment where there is none.\n\nFTR, oilfield work is no less noble than legal work. Both fill a need.", "NTA. Keep the pictures.

Guess y'all are even now.", "NTA. There's nothing to suggest you would ever publicly humiliate him with these pictures. Private ribbing between siblings is another matter entirely. And if your brother hadn't given you so much crap over the years about your career in oil, you wouldn't have taken the pictures in the first place.", "LoL definitely NTA", "NTA. It IS funny that he needed the help of your big ass truck.", "I'm a tree hugger and I approve of your actions.  \n\nAct superior to others and they will remind you of it when you least want them too.", "NTA\n\nThe irony is too strong to not document it. \n\nIf you were to post them somewhere, you'd probably have to explain why it's funny, and then it isn't funny, anymore anyway.", "YTA. It was funny but it was an emergency and he needed you. Not cool to kick a person when they\u2019re down and shaming them. Even if they own a fucking Tesla. You\u2019ll have other opportunities to shut him down, but not this exact moment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you had asked me nicely, maybe even acknowledged that you have been a bit of a dick to me, I would have deleted those pictures with humor and grace. As it is you have been both insulting and aggressive so I'm going to make damned sure I keep them.

Your brother sounds like a dick but realistically, you\u2019re an asshole here. \n\nThe only reason you could possibly have to take the pictures is to use them in some way in the future and if you\u2019re willing to use them as you describe them it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be back here in a couple of months or years asking us again if you\u2019re an asshole when you post them to Facebook in a fit of pique. \n\nJust delete them.
