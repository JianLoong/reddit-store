My favorite comment of the year. \u201cI can be ornery\u201d lmao idk why that one got me \ud83d\ude02", "Also, charging his BEV from the diesel generator is more environmentally friendly than driving a truck on diesel combustion as you get a higher efficiency in the conversion from chemical and thermal to electric energy compared to converting it to mechanical energy.", "It's the current case of electric cars as they are not ready for the type of use that a regular car dies. There are lots if limits. He didn't PLAN to get stuck and could have just as easily run out of gas. Brother's the asshole for using this situation to try to humiliate OP because he's a competitive jerk. Brother didn't do anything wrong by needing a charge any more than he would be if he needed gas.

It makes him an AH for how he treats his brother regardless of whether this emergency happened or not. The brother is opposed to oil being as necessary. That there weren\u2019t enough no -oil options to rescue him actually supports his point and desire to make sure that there are moving forward.", "Old saying: \"Eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.\" Gandhi", "Refusing help likely would have actively hurt or even killed his brother. 18 hours in the cold?\n\nJesus, it's never ending how cruel people can be.", "I was really surprised at some of the things on the lists that are made from oil.

Fly that pettycopter high", "I don't really understand the brother's freak out here? It was an emergency. He was smart enough to call in reinforcement in the form of his brother.\n\nIs the guy's reputation truly going to be ruined by the pictures? Come on now.

OP just seems jealous and insecure.", ">Brother doesn\u2019t like there is documentation of him not practicing what he preaches\n\nI didn't realize that practicing being environmentally conscious meant that he has to be stuck on the side of the road in the cold with a dead battery in his car", "Electric vehicles are a kinda a scam.  Electricity isn\u2019t generated by magic.  Instead, the electricity that runs them comes from a number of polluting sources, including burning coal.  In fact, 22% of US electricity comes from burning coal, so in reality 1 in 5 Teslas are coal burners.  NTA", "Nah.. I disagree. I just think he is acting like a brother.  As long as he doesn't post or send them around NTA. My husband's family would do this shit and I can guarantee the recused party would sheepishly hang their head and admit they were the asshole for talking so much shit. After a good laugh would be had by all.\n\nNow, if bro decides to post or humiliate little bro, then he would be T-A. I wouldn't be surprised if little bro decides to stop shit talking the photos would \"miraculously\" disappear. \n\nNTA", "It's not the wanting to be environmentally friendly.

I have an issue with OP because he is a welder working on an oil field. The fact that OP is a welder and choose to works for an oil company is what makes him an asshole."]}
