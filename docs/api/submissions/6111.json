While it's true that (some) batteries run on lithium if you think about it, to charge a battery you need electricity, which can just as well come from fossil fuel, or aqua-electricity (I'm not sure what the term is) requiring dams that shift river flows and wildlife. The truth is that solar panels and batteries as they exist today are not sustainable at all, but only aim at exploiting resource niches that have been less tapped into. The only real sustainable way of generating power is nuclear fusion, which might be closer to achieve than we think.", "Convert the photo to a customized windshield sunshade\n\nhttps://ibb.co/M9NPQ4W", "Can I second this??

But the brother was being incredibly obnoxious about it and giving OP a hard time for working in the oil industry, as if the oil industry shouldn't exist at all anymore. But as the brother just learned, oil is still very much a necessity and electric power isn't at the place yet that it could have easily saved him from this predicament.\n\nTHAT'S what makes the brother a hypocrite.", "No it\u2019s not hypocrisy it\u2019s irony and THATS why it\u2019s funny!", "So OP is the TA for taking pictures for his own amusement?

That\u2019s why I think they shouldn\u2019t exist. When you oppose a system that has an outsized effect on society, it isn\u2019t surprising that you would still occasionally be forced to use that system. That\u2019s part of the reason why you would oppose the system. \n\nOil isn\u2019t a necessity, and the only reason electric power isn\u2019t at the place yet where it could have easily saved him from this predicament is because the oil industry itself is doing everything it can to discourage and hold back the electric industry. \n\nIf oil wasn\u2019t so easily available, we\u2019d probably have tow trucks with built in battery packs to recharge vehicles in the roadside. You could easily fit two of those Tesla garage batteries (power wall or whatever they call it) in an empty truck bed. If those are fully charged, you could go around using that truck to partially recharge dead electric vehicles. \n\nThe technology already exists. The only reason no one has bothered to make one of those trucks and popularize their use is that oil is still so common and easily available, and not enough people have adopted electric vehicles to make it worth a garage\u2019s time and money. I guarantee that if gas cars were phased out tomorrow, these trucks would be on the road by February. \n\nMoreover, the whole point is that the brother is complaining how prevalent oil is. The fact that he needed help and the only option he had was to use oil proves his point. He\u2019s right that society doesn\u2019t offer enough environmental options. That\u2019s why he got stuck in this situation. If oil were less prevalent, there would have been better options available. He wouldn\u2019t have been forced to use oil. Part of what he\u2019s protesting is the lack of alternative environmental options, and the fact that he got in a situation where there was an immense lack of environmental options only makes his case. \n\nThe brother is 0% a hypocrite in this situation. This isn\u2019t a gotcha. If anything, the fact that you think the brother is a hypocrite shows how little you understand what environmentalists are actually upset about.", "Like i said, i do not condone lil brothers behavior towards his bro as well, lil brother is a dick about it.
