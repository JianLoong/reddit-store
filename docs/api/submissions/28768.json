She is unreasonable and has unhealthy boundaries with family so of course she's not going to see your perspective. \n\nTell her in no uncertain terms that you and your husband will be going on your honeymoon alone. Do not tell her where you're going or when. Do not entertain any arguments about it and don't tell her all your reasons. You do not have to explain yourself and it won't help anyway.

If they ask what countries just laugh and say it's so complicated! So much to  plan! I can barely think about it! Laugh it off and move on. You need to reduce how much involvement they have in your decision making and plans to a point where you just let them know things when its too late for them to do anything about it or join you.\n\nAlso, you need to think about your husband here, not just yourself vs your parents. If I was your husband and I had to share my honeymoon with your boundary stomping, entitled, weird parents I would be furious and I probably just wouldn't go. It would forever ruin the honeymoon and I'd be afraid that it sets the precedent that we would never have a trip to our selves in the future.

Keep all travel information secret and probably out of anywhere your mother may snoop and find it.

Good luck, and I hope you and your husband have a great honeymoon alone. \n\nI also agree with other commenters saying to give your parents the wrong details of your honeymoon, i.e., wrong city/country, wrong dates, etc. I would also silence their notifications or block them while on your honeymoon so you can have some peace and not worry about them being mean to you, manipulating you, or just bothering you.", "NTA.

And do you have the resources to do so? If yes, you could add to Step One- We would love to go with you to X next year though, so why don't you focus on planning that trip with me. \n\nStep Three: Be ready for the \"selfish\" fight and don't put up with it, now or ever again. \"Mom, wanting to vacation without you is not selfish, I still do X, Y, Z with you.\" \"Mom, I'm not going to fight about this, we aren't planning our honeymoon with you, and I'm sorry that upsets you but I won't change my mind.\" \"Mom, if you keep trying to make me feel guilty about this, I'm going to walk away from the conversation and will continue to do that until you let it go.\"\n\nStep Four: Keep up these boundaries.

We will let you know our decision once it's been made\". Or \"your sharing is making me feel a little overwhelmed right now. I'll let you know if I need more information to help me make my decision.\"\n\nThe key when first learning boundaries, to get them more easily accepted, is to compliment the other person. Let them know you appreciate them, hold them in high regard, etc., and that you will take their opinions/thoughts/etc into consideration, but will be making the decision yourself. \n\nPractice one or two ways to shut down conversations as well. Keep it simple and non-committal. \"This topic is not up for discussion at this time\" is a great one.

She's never going to stop guilt tripping you, you just have to work on not being affected.\n\nI'm also Asian and I had to callous myself against feeling bad about my parents' remarks and when I finally got fed up as an adult, I started just leaving in the middle of dinner when they brought up my weight or infertility. Didn't matter if they were in my home, if I was in their house, if we were at a restaurant... I would just look at them and say \"you know I aaked you to never bring these subjects up\" and walk out the door. It only took about 3 months for them to stop and nowadays when my mother would start making comments, my dad will elbow her to shush up.", "Look up info on \u201cinformation diets\u201d and \u201cgrey rocking\u201d.  Say your no, do not give an explanation, then grey rock or just get off the phone. \u201cLove you: talk to you later, bye\u201d and hang up before giving them a chance to say anything else.  \n\nIt does get easier, much easier.  They aren\u2019t going to like it at first, but that\u2019s ok.  You are the one loving your life, not them.  \n\nPlease go on your honeymoon with just your husband! \n\nDon\u2019t tell them any plans.  Just go.", "You mom is using guilt to manipulate you. She can push your buttons because she installed your buttons. Therapy can help you learn to recognize her behavior and establish boundaries. You are learning a new skill. You need support while you practice it. \n\nGet this under control now. It will only get worse - especially if you have children. NTA", "Say no. Say you want a COMPLETE experience with your partner.", "No is the most beautiful word to say. I didn't have as severe as codependency from my mom but life has definitely improved ALOT since I learned No. I wish you all of the luck.", "Part of this is an info diet and learning to be a gray rock. Just don\u2019t tell her where or when you\u2019re doing things and she doesn\u2019t know to try to interfere. When she pushes for info, be as interesting as a gray rock, easy conversation, non- committal language.", "Or just dont say nothing and go, you are an adult. NTA.", "Part of establishing a boundary is defending it.\n\nDefending the boundary does NOT include having to justify or engage in a debate with the boundary breaker about it.\n\nA simple \"No. I don't want to do that and it's not up for discussion\" should be stated.\n\nIf your parents want to keep digging, you need to reiterate your position and then, if they continue to push you need to leave or tell them to leave (if this is happening at your home). Hanging up on someone who won't take no for an answer is completely justified.\n\nYou are going to have to deal with hurt feelings on your parents side. You will not be able to say no and have your parents be happy about it. You may have flying monkeys (siblings or relatives taking up your parents side) to deal with. Again, you need to be clear and direct. Do not engage in a debate or try to justify your decision. \"I told my parents no. I'm not changing my mind because of you. This is my last word.\" Again, you may need to tell someone to leave or hang up on them if they continue to push.\n\nNTA.", "Maybe this should simply be a case of beg for forgiveness instead of beg for permission? Idk you know your family best so if you say that would irreparably break up your relationship then don\u2019t do it but otherwise it might just be the least stressful decision to just tell them afterwards that you already went and what a great time you had.\n\nEdit: typo", "r/AsianParentStories", "Talk to your parents and tell them that as much as you love them, your honeymoon is a bonding time for you and your husband to be a family together. You and your husband need the time to establish the love and trust that your parents already have.

Tell them you love them and look forward to future trips with them as a married couple but the honeymoon is only for the bride and groom. Congratulations on you marriage.", "Yes. Just repeat as often as necessary: \u201ca couple is entitled to go on their honeymoon alone, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d", "If they overstep and don't take no for a answer just simply block them or go less contact if you have to talk to them", "Two options here:\n1. obey to gaslighting for the rest of your life.\n2. make a decision, stand your ground and if there\u2019s guilt trapping ignore it and stand your ground.", "Think about it this way: if she weren\u2019t making guilt-tripping comments about *this* decision, she would be making them about some *other* decision you\u2019ve made. There is no such thing as good enough with a parent like this. Trying to attain it is impossible, they\u2019ll just move the goalposts. \n\nSo, if you\u2019re always (in her eyes) going to be wrong/mean/ungrateful/rude/failing her in some way, why not just be those things while doing what you want?

Even if you did everything \u201cperfectly\u201d and according to her desires, you know that she will simply find something new to nitpick, so why do what she wants at all?\n\nShe\u2019s hell-bent on making herself miserable either way, no matter what you do, don\u2019t let her make you miserable along with her by acquiescing to her childish, petty tantrums.", "And do NOT tell her where you are going or she will show up there.", "Yes-- definitely keep the destinations a secret!"]}
