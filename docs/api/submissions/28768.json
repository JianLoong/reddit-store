She is unreasonable and has unhealthy boundaries with family so of course she's not going to see your perspective. \n\nTell her in no uncertain terms that you and your husband will be going on your honeymoon alone. Do not tell her where you're going or when. Do not entertain any arguments about it and don't tell her all your reasons. You do not have to explain yourself and it won't help anyway.

They don\u2019t need to hear every detail of your life or have decisions shared with them, especially if they are ones you don\u2019t want them involved in. It\u2019s an adjustment because as you said, we are expected to follow their lead as their kids, but you are married now.

If they ask what countries just laugh and say it's so complicated! So much to  plan! I can barely think about it! Laugh it off and move on. You need to reduce how much involvement they have in your decision making and plans to a point where you just let them know things when its too late for them to do anything about it or join you.\n\nAlso, you need to think about your husband here, not just yourself vs your parents. If I was your husband and I had to share my honeymoon with your boundary stomping, entitled, weird parents I would be furious and I probably just wouldn't go. It would forever ruin the honeymoon and I'd be afraid that it sets the precedent that we would never have a trip to our selves in the future.

Keep all travel information secret and probably out of anywhere your mother may snoop and find it.

Good luck, and I hope you and your husband have a great honeymoon alone. \n\nI also agree with other commenters saying to give your parents the wrong details of your honeymoon, i.e., wrong city/country, wrong dates, etc. I would also silence their notifications or block them while on your honeymoon so you can have some peace and not worry about them being mean to you, manipulating you, or just bothering you.", "NTA.

And do you have the resources to do so? If yes, you could add to Step One- We would love to go with you to X next year though, so why don't you focus on planning that trip with me. \n\nStep Three: Be ready for the \"selfish\" fight and don't put up with it, now or ever again. \"Mom, wanting to vacation without you is not selfish, I still do X, Y, Z with you.\" \"Mom, I'm not going to fight about this, we aren't planning our honeymoon with you, and I'm sorry that upsets you but I won't change my mind.\" \"Mom, if you keep trying to make me feel guilty about this, I'm going to walk away from the conversation and will continue to do that until you let it go.\"\n\nStep Four: Keep up these boundaries.

We will let you know our decision once it's been made\". Or \"your sharing is making me feel a little overwhelmed right now. I'll let you know if I need more information to help me make my decision.\"\n\nThe key when first learning boundaries, to get them more easily accepted, is to compliment the other person. Let them know you appreciate them, hold them in high regard, etc., and that you will take their opinions/thoughts/etc into consideration, but will be making the decision yourself. \n\nPractice one or two ways to shut down conversations as well. Keep it simple and non-committal. \"This topic is not up for discussion at this time\" is a great one.
