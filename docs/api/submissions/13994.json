She loves all those grays and neutrals, our whole house is neutral colored and so is her entire wardrobe. Shes been this way since before it was really a thing. I was raised on those little wooden toys with no faces or bright colors. But i\u2019ve never really given her general \u201caesthetic\u201d much thought. Though her wardrobe may be bland her personality certainly is not, my mom can be very dramatic at times. Shes always just been a loud person. \n\nWell for her 33rd birthday party I decided I was going to take charge and make her cake for her, free of charge I might add! (Though I would never expect her to pay me since shes my mother but nonetheless) It was a pretty simple cake, homemade white buttercream with a pink, yellow, and green border and decorations around the sides. On the day of the party, I surprised her with the reveal of the cake. Mind you, people were set to arrive in 15-20 minutes at the time of the reveal. My mom totally lost it when she saw my cake! She said she couldn\u2019t believe I would ruin her party like this, the cake was so out of place, how I should know she never would\u2019ve asked for these colors, etc. The thing is, she asked me to surprise her! And her \u201creal\u201d favorite colors have always been the colors I used! \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t serve my cake at her party, it\u2019s been confined to the freezer, and she\u2019s still upset about it, after the party has ended. I don\u2019t know what to do! I keep thinking it\u2019ll blow over but she\u2019s been in her room all night since her guests left and I don\u2019t know if shes forgiven me or not!

You made a very kind and generous gesture, and your mom was incredibly ungracious and ungrateful to you in return. Also who puts so much weight on whether the cake matches the 'theme'? \n\nYou should have half-blown up beige and black balloons and added a banner that read 'IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.'", "Unless your mother asked for a specific cake, she doesn't really have any room to complain about the cake you made for her. NTA and that's a stupid overreaction from a 33YO.", "NTA. It was a birthday cake, not a reason to overreact the way she did.", "NTA - If your Mom had a specific aesthetic or theme she wanted for her party she should have said so. She asked you to surprise her and OP you did. That was extremely rude and unkind of her. She should have just been thankful, or if it was that upsetting ask if there was a way to take the border off before it was served. If not oh well! People are just going to eat it. I wouldn't make her another cake in the future unless she apologizes.", "NTA, at all. You\u2019re only 17, you made your parent a cake with your own time and resources. Do you know how many grown adults have never done such a thing for their parents? \n\nYour mum should be happy that their child would go to this much time and effort. To shame you like that over the colours of the cake is honestly unbelievable. Do NOT apologise for anything, she has overreacted and frankly doesn\u2019t deserve you.", "NTA\n\nDo you have family that could talk to your mom? This seems like a weird thing, to me. I'm 34, so I don't think it's an age thing. I'm wondering if there's something else bothering her that she can't share with you because you're her kid. Beginning of a mid-life crisis or something, perhaps? Her reaction is just so... odd. Even if my mom hated everything about a cake I made, she would serve and eat it and laugh about it the whole time.", "NTA. I guess it isn\u2019t the thought that counts for her?  If she wanted something specific or even in general, she had the opportunity to say so. She is reacting like a toddler. Perhaps having you so young stunted her maturity?  \n\nEvery year growing up my mom would bake me my favorite cake for my birthday. Once I got married, my wife asked my mom if she could do it. In 20 years, she\u2019s never got it exactly right, but it is baked out of love so who really cares, it still is a cake baked for me so I love it.  This year 15 and 13 asked if they could bake it. It came out looking like an elephant turd on a plate and and tasted a little off, but who cares?  It\u2019s a cake baked for me!!  I hugged them and told them how proud of them I am and blessed to be their parent like I should. I just cannot understand the entitlement and lack of appreciation shown here", "NTA. Your mom needs to get a grip - it's a cake! Everyone loves cake, no matter the color! And YOU made it for her.", "NTA she asked you to surprise her, you did a nice thing and made her a cake with some different colours to usual, your mum is out of order for the way she reacted, if i bought my parent a little gift for their birthday they would still be grateful for the effort even if they didn\u2019t like it.", "NTA. it\u2019s literally just a cake. birthday cakes may matter to children but at 33 years old?!?! Just be glad there\u2019s cake and your own daughter took the time to make it.\n\nAlso if she wanted neutral coloured cake then she shouldnt have asked for you to \u201csurprise her\u201d", "Definitely NTA. A gift is a gift, you took the time to make her a cake for her birthday and she doesn't like it because it's not the right color? How entitled...", "NTA - wtf is wrong with that lady?", "NTA - You didn't do anything wrong, this has nothing to do with you. Birthdays can bring up emotions in people, maybe she's thinking about her life, maybe she's in a bad state of mind, it just might be a straw/camels back situation. My suggestion would be to give her space, leave it, and have a discussion where surely she'll apologise, but stand your ground you did a nice thing.", "NTA. Your mom's TA. Very mean.", "NTA.\n\nOP, I\u2019m so sorry your mom reacted in such an inappropriate and hurtful way to the cake you made her. That was wrong of her. It should be her apologizing to you, not the other way around. You did a thoughtful thing for her, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this.", "Nope. NTA. I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s how she reacted. Even if I felt like that I still would\u2019ve been gracious.", "NTA Your Mom is. You put a lot of thought and effort into making a special cake for her and she couldn't even say thank you. You didn't ruin her birthday she did that all by herself. She also ruined it for you too. She owes you a thank you for the thought and effort and an apology.", "a gentle ESH\n\nYour mom's reaction seems very dramatic considering it's over the colors of a birthday cake. I don't see why she's being so mean to you about it.\n\nBuuuut it kinda sounds like you don't like your mom's personal style, and you decided to \"take charge and make her cake for her\" to force your personal taste on her. Making a cake for someone is a very nice thing to do... but taking that opportunity to cater to your tastes and not theirs is kinda an AH move. She can have her own style, let her have it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

The response was childish, I'm sure the cake was delicious :)", "NTA. Maybe you could have thought more about what colors she would like on the cake but\u2026 do they make beige icing?", "NTA.", "NTA, your mums the AH.", "NTA!

This was a very thoughtful and sweet present and literally everyone I know would've LOVED to get a cake from their kid on their birthday.", "I'm also 33F, and I work in architecture. You might say that aesthetic is important to me.

You went through the time and the effort to make your mom a homemade cake for her birthday with her favorite colors and this is how she reacted? OP, after this, I would never make her anything again. She is being an entitled, immature brat.", "NTA. Your mother gave birth to you as a child and got stuck in that mentality.", "NTA it\u2019s not like you made a penis or titties cake, even though they\u2019d match the colour scheme.", "> I don't know what to do\n\nEat cake.\n\nNTA.", "They\u2019ll match the carpet!", "That's kind of flashy, an index card with 'birth' written on one side would be more tasteful.\n\n\nThat said, this is definitely not about the cake colors, and quite possibly not even about OP at all.", "Ikr???  NTA.\n\nIt was colorful frosting.  You didnt actually paint the walls in the house or *gasp* add bright throw pillows to the sofa!  Something else has to going on.\n\nFor her to be so \"dramatic\" over a bright cake, have them been many times like this in the past where Mom was \"dramatic\"?

If she hated the colors so much there was a stupidly easy solution, here: eat the damn cake.\n\nUnless she planned on encasing the whole thing in epoxy or resin or something and permanently displaying it in the living room, it would've been served up, eaten, and if there was any left over long enough to go stale she could throw it away. Maybe she could make a mental note to mention her preferred colors for the next occasion.\n\nThis was a non-issue to the point of being laughable.\n\nNTA, OP. You did a wonderful thing, I'm so sorry your mother was so ungrateful.", ">her \u201creal\u201d favorite colors\n\nWhy did she say they are her \u201creal\u201d favorite colors?

Why is the real in quotation marks!", "i\u2019m assuming there\u2019s colours that she likes for her house and clothing aesthetic and colours she actually enjoys.

Is there something else going on in your mom's life that would maybe be causing her stress, or making her act unusually??? Or is this a pattern of behavior???  It seems like an exaggerated reaction over a nice gesture.  Rest assured, you did not ruin her birthday.  I'm 36, with a 17 year old daughter, so I was a teen mom too.  I get slightly emotional when I give my kid her allowance and she bring me back a chocolate bar, if she made me an entire birthday cake, it wouldn't matter what colour it was, I'd probably cry from joy.  I'm sorry your mother made you feel like you did something wrong.  I think you acted with kindness and love, and that means a lot.", "NTA.  My guess is there's something else going on.  Good luck.", "nta, you made her a cake, you didn't do anything wrong at all. I'm sorry your mom basically spat on your gift", "NTA, but this is not about the cake. It\u2019s quite possible that your mother is taking out her frustration about something in her life on you and the cake. Talk to her when she\u2019s calmed down. It\u2019s not okay that she behaved this way, it\u2019s very sweet that you made a cake for her, but I promise you, this is not about the cake.", "you are NTA.\n\nwhat your mother did to you was beyond cruel and unnecessary. really gross behaviour on her part.", "NTA- Your mom is super immature.", "NTA if she tries to make you apologise, just tell her she is selfish, rude and ungrateful after all the work you put in.", "NTA! Im 33 years old, I might not have a teenage child but I do have a child. I would never in a million years complain if my child (or anyone at all) dedicated their time to make me a homemade cake.

You tried to do something very nice, and your mom's reaction was completely inappropriate.", "NTA.  This is emotional abuse!  I strongly suspect your mom is a narcissist.  Please go talk to the school counselor about this.  How awful to treat you this way when you did such a lovely thing for her birthday!", "NTA. Your mom is bonkers and I'm sorry she treated you like that. From now on, don't bother trying. It sounds like she isn't worth it", "NTA. your mother is 33 years old and is acting like she's 5.", "I see your Office reference ... take all of my poor person awards. \ud83e\udd47\ud83c\udfc5", "Exactly this. I'm not a parent but if someone made me a cake (or anything really) and it was the ugliest most horrible thing I'd ever seen, I'd love it and tell them so.\n\nIt's not quite the same, but a friend's little sister was starting to get really into makeup and was just learning some new stuff, so I let her try it out on me. It was not good lol but that super wasn't the point. I wore it out with her and my friends on a grocery trip even. I may not have liked it, but I sure as shit acted like I did. And now she's really really really good with makeup. My point is, that was an awful way for your mother to react, OP and you are absolutely NTA."]}
