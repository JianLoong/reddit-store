He bought it as he saw it, and a year is waaayyy too late to be complaining about it.\n\n> He says that he noticed issues such as a green tinge to the screen and frequent crashing after only a week of using it but did not come back to me until now because [...]\n\nYeah right. Dry that one out and he can replace Russia as the world's biggest fertilizer exporter.", "NTA.   Nice try (he can only ask) but like you my response would be a firm NO.  You sold him a used laptop; you'd owe him nothing if it had broke the next day.   You certainly owe him nothing after a year.  If they want a laptop that comes with a warranty they should buy a new one.", "NTA.  \nThere\u2019s risk in buying used items.  Your friend should know that.  Also, they had a year to damage the thing. Reasonable people wouldn\u2019t ask for a refund.", "[Edit - NTA] INFO: Were you aware of any issues with the device when you sold it, and if so, did you inform him? I've had a Mac with a failing logic board before, it's a hard problem to ignore. If you were getting kernel panics and hard crashes before you sold it, you should have warned him.", "NTA. Same rules apply for buying from friends as strangers on Facebook or craigslist or whatever. It had no problems when it was purchased and he should have known the risks of buying second hand. If he wanted a low price with a guarantee, he should have bought a refurbished product from a certified reseller.", "nta. If he saw issues he could've atleast contacted you remotely. Why wait a year to get back until it fully breaks? I don't see any correlation between you making more money than him. I'm sure companies he buys laptops from make more money than him, would they refund half of it? I doubt it.", "NTA and he's not a real friend. Sounds like he's trying to manipulate you into giving him money because he thinks you have more money than him. Real friends don't do that.", " NTA.  Private sales don\u2019t come with a money back guarantee.\n\nStores refund for defective items as they have licensing agreements and they get their money back from the manufacturer.  But after more than a year you are usually on your own for repairs unless you bought the extended warranty.\n\nWhen you buy privately you are buying a used item and accept all risks associated with buying something used from an unlicensed seller.  Even if the box was never opened and the item unused, it is legally considered a used item as it had an owner.", "NTA \n\nYou buy second hand goods \u201cas is\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s why it\u2019s sometimes not a good idea to buy and sell between friends but go to a recognized place that refurbishes things and offers a warranty. \n\nBut nobody gets a refund a year later. That\u2019s just crazy logic!", "NTA if he wanted a money back guarantee then he should have paid full price through a retailer that offered a warranty. You pay less for a private sale of something used and as part of that you take the risk that there could be unknown issues because a private seller doesn\u2019t typically have the ability to check everything out the way a store does.", "NTA. Your friend is a nutjob.", "NTA, i would never take responsibility for a private sale a year after it happened. You have no control over what the buyer did with it.", "NTA.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a lesson learnt - never sell anything to a relative, friend, or co-worker. It\u2019s not worth the drama.", "NTA\n\nA year ago?  You sold it as is.  He should of checked it out in front of you.  His responsibility now.", "NTA,  as the transaction was carried out over 12 months ago. For goods that were purchased As Is...as they were second hand.\n\nIs this person for real", "NTA at all. This is the sort of thing that people should consider when buying second hand/used electronics. I would probably give some sort of a refund, but half sounds like way too much if he got a year out of it. Maybe 1/3 if you are feeling generous, but you are not to blame for any course of action you decide.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Private sales of used goods should always be under a \"buyer beware\" mindset. It's why I always looked for the lowest price possible when buying used electronics in college. I asked myself, \"What can I afford to lose if this thing breaks day 1?\" If he had said something to you after the first use, I might say it would be nice for you to work with him as a gesture of friendship (with the understanding that you're under no obligation). However, a year is way too long you wait to say he's been having problems. First, how can we know he didn't cause those problems? Second, that machine is now unsellable. \n\nYou're definitely in the right here.", "Nta. He's trying to scam you", "NTA, you don't owe him anything for laptop repairs after a year. You have no idea how it's been maintained, if he's spilled liquid on it, allowed it to get overheated, etc. He bought a used laptop with no guarantee. I've been looking at refurbished laptops on Amazon and even they only give a 90 day guarantee.", "NTA It is a year ago! It was used and a private sale. What more need to be say? And using it for a year when he had problems right from the start - he mostly caused them self because he kept using it without solving the problem.\n\nAnd... he is a friend and never said a work about the problems he has with the laptop in the whole year? Either he isn't a friend or never had problems before.", "NTA. He bought a USED laptop, which comes with NO guarantees, is strictly an AS IS situation. If he had SAID something about a problem right away, or even in the first month or two - he might have had some small level of claim to a refund. However a year later is well beyond any expectation of any refund. He fully got what he paid for from a used laptop. No refund of any sort should be expected.", "NTA. Sold as seen means just that. There are no guarantees.", "NTA for saying no, but i am not sure if losing a friend over half the cost of a used laptop is worth it.  you sold him a piece of junk.  you should have just given it to him tbh.", "Surely he had email or could have sent a text or even snail mail. The fact he didn't suggests laptop was functional for a time.", "Absolutely not, I thought the machine was in very good condition, as did he after looking at it.", "Yup all of this, NTA OP. \n\nYour friend is being ridiculous and should only buy new from stores/companies going forward as his ideas on what happens with a used item privately sold do not match up to reality.", "Why should he give a refund though? The friend saw the laptop in working order and agreed to purchase it, knowing it was used.\n\nThe fact he had it a year and now it is broken is on him - who knows what he was downloading or how he treated it in that time?", "It worked with minor hiccups even if believe friend's story in its entirity for a year. Most brand new laptops have warranties of a year and refurbs three months. Laptop was in remote area so higher chance of damage from surges and travel there.\nI'd argue that a friend shouldn't try and swindle a friend out of money because they \"percieve\" them to be richer.", "Exactly!", "In that case NTA.", "Nta if he had problems  he would  have  let you know  right away  imo. Not after a year and after the computer  is completely  broken.", "NTA - It is a year later and he is just bringing this up now. I'm the type of person that would have split the cost of repairs in the first 30 days for a friend but this just broke and he is trying to guilt you and take advantage of you. Do not pay.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a used laptop, and he used it for a year. At that point, any problem is his.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My feeling is that no-one else on the planet would refund half the cost of a laptop after a year\" .. Exactly", "NTA\n\nIt is actually funny he thinks that he deserves half the money back. And that too after a year! There always is a risk when purchasing 2nd hand goods and one must be ready for that during purchase itself. Also, your friend already used it for a year. Who in the right mind demands half money back after purchasing and using. You already sold it, what happens after that isn't your responsibility or liability.", "NTA. If it broke the next day then I would refund. Suggest your friend sell it on eBay for parts to recover some of the money he spent on it.", "NTA\n\nA year is plenty of time to express any concerns and ask for a return.\n\nWith that being said, if that is how he feels, you may be terminating the friendship over x dollars. If it\u2019s a real close friend of yours otherwise I may just give him half back and look at as \u201cI rented my laptop out for half of x dollars for the last year of its life\u201d and then never ever ever ever ever buy or sell anything from this friend again, for the sake of this friendship, he can only borrow or have things from now on, and same with you.", "NTA.", "NTA. If there were issues at the start he should have contacted you then. \n\nBut I honestly doubt there were any. You would have likely seen them yourself. Plus it seems awfully convenient that they developed just as he got it and he just \u2018couldn\u2019t\u2019 get ahold of you before now when it\u2019s broken.", "NTA. Maybe if it broke in the first month but after a year?  No way...", "You would be under no obligation to refund him a dime if it'd been even 30 days (or even less!) since you sold it. A year is HILARIOUS. You're not Best Buy - you did not offer him a warranty on it \ud83d\ude02 tell him to get f'ed. He's trying to take advantage of you and your friendship. News flash, actual friends don't do that.", "Yeah if he was using it for work then he had email access.", "I didn't say the OP should do it. I said I would based on all the circumstances listed in the original writing. Obviously it would also depend on the lapto itself, if it was old and terrible already then probably not. \n\nIt said in the OP that the friend experienced problems with it way faster than a year, which is not OP's fault, but unfortunate regardless, because it sounds the person really needed the laptop and could not return it, due to location/work. So if that happened to someone I valued, I would perceive it as fair to throw them a bone rather than treat the situation as if it was a random person buying it from me. \n\nBut again, choosing not to is a perfectly valid and right thing to do too. There are a lot of variables and personal values to consider. That's just what I'd consider fair towards my friends."]}
