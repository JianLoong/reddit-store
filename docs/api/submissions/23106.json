{"id": 23106, "submission_id": "1596ss2", "title": "AITA for not going grocery shopping for my brother after I injured my foot?", "selftext": "I (22F) got hurt yesterday and had to get stitches on my left foot. I am currently staying at my parent\u2019s house with my dad and younger brother (18M) for summer break. Since my mom is on vacation I do everything around the house (my dad and brother both work so it makes sense and it doesn\u2019t bother me), often including grocery shopping, though my dad does that as well. My brother is a very picky eater, and always cooks for himself since he doesn\u2019t like anything we eat at home. Every single day he complains that the fridge is \u201cempty\u201d, even when there\u2019s clearly a ton of food that we just bought. At the same time, he never comes along when we go grocery shopping and refuses to tell us what to buy for him when we ask. If I ask him what he wants me to buy he says he doesn\u2019t know and apparently expects me to just guess exactly what he wants to eat. Today he woke up and started yelling about how there is nothing for him to eat (my dad went grocery shopping last night so there\u2019s definitely a lot of food in the fridge) and demanded that I go grocery shopping since my dad is working and my brother doesn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. I told him I can barely walk on my left foot and I would like to rest since I was at the ER until 1am this morning. I offered to cook some Pasta Carbonara for him, since it\u2019s something I know he eats, but he said I don\u2019t know how to make it and that it would suck. I listed other meals he could make with what we have in the fridge but he doesn\u2019t want to hear any of it. My brother called my mom to do some more complaining and my mom said I should go grocery shopping. I am not going because I don\u2019t want to hurt my foot any further. Am I the asshole?\n\nPS: I forgot to mention that while I was literally bl**ding all over the floor last night because of my foot injury he was in the same room complaining about how the Burger King staff messed up his burger that my dad got for him", "created_utc": 1690287296, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1596ss2/aita_for_not_going_grocery_shopping_for_my/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
