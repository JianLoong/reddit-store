You have Jess's back as you should if you're going to be her husband. Keep doing that. Your mom and aunt were horrible to Jess and don't blame you one but for not wanting to invite them to your special day if all they're going to do is tear her down.

And even if you are willing to forgive your mom, your fiancee has to be 100% on board with allowing them to attend.\n\nAgain it's up to the two of you, but I'd say mom has to make a genuine apology for a start, and specifically to promise never to say another WORD about your fiancee's figure, period.\n\nIf you don't care about your side of the family attending, then just leave it.", "NTA.

While it's unfortunate, I think that if she was invited to your wedding, she would do or say something awful.  For your fiancee's sake, I wouldn't invite her.  Not to mention the fact that your fiancee tried to involve her and she only got vicious behavior in response.  In fact, I'd make it clear to your mom that her own behavior got her uninvited.", "Well, They won't be showing up then.", "First off corpse bride kick ass\n\n\nSo put that in your book for reference\n\n\n\nSecond she needs to pipe up with the quick comebacks\n\n\nJust sayin", "\"The entire week my phone has been blowing up with messages from my whole family saying that half of them won't show up if I continue to be cruel to my mom.\"\n\nYour mom & aunt have been cruel with Jess for ages and if your family members are okay with that, I say it's a good thing they won't be there.

It would be a bummer if your mom can't attend - especially since your fiance wanted your mom there and she may feel responsible for them not coming - but ultimately, this event is for you and your soon-to-be wife and you shouldn't have anyone there that makes it unpleasant for either of you. As far as what your mom and aunt said...that sucks. I think there is this idea that body shaming is acceptable or even appreciated if it is directed toward thinner individuals. They may have a hard time understanding that their words are just as hurtful as if they told an overweight woman that she looked like Miss Piggy in a wedding dress and yet that is almost certainly something they would know not to say. \n\nAs a thinner lady myself, I have always gotten shit from my family. Sometimes genuine concern but usually the basic \"someone get this girl a sandwich!\"  I can understand the genuine concern, but the jokes are annoying and they get old fast. It's frustrating that making comments about my weight and eating habits is fine but if I were to say anything remotely similar about my sister (on the heavier side), I would definitely be an insensitive asshole. \n\n I think if you've made it clear that these comments are not acceptable and they are unwilling to respect that, it is perfectly reasonable to uninvite them. Hopefully they can gain some perspective on the harmful nature of their words and make changes so as to not miss out on a relationship with you and your fiance.", "NTA. I... I just can't.

They attempt to connect with them and try to make them feel welcomed. Even if they don't \\*like\\* the person, per se, they'll still treat him or her with a minimum basic respect. They understand that marriage means drastic rearrangement of one's interpersonal priorities, because your spouse - as a (hopefully) lifelong companion through life's trials and tribulations - is equally as important as your parents, and ought to be treated as such. \n\n'Monsters', on the other hand, see their child getting married as a threat. Such women view the spouse as a wicked usurper, threatening her place in their child's life. They therefore attempt to assert power over him or her, securing their own place by bullying their victim into submission. Success establishes the mother as 'dominant', shunting the spouse into a distinct - and distant - second place. \n\nThis is what your mom is trying to do. Don't let her get away with it.

I used to shop sometimes with one friend and we'd be looking in the children's department.  She wore a size 0 or 1 or whatever those small sizes are.  Her whole family was like that.  It's just as insulting to them to point out their slenderness as it is to point out that someone is overweight.", "Actually, thin is back in! (I'm not saying this to discredit thin body shaming, it does happen too.) \n\nOkay my knowledge on this comes from TikTok, just as a caveat. Things they say foreshadow thin being in ala the early 2000s - Kim K getting her butt implants taken out, y2k fashion trending, reimergance of the proAna movements with bloggers once again referring my friend Mia and Ana. This time around it's coated in more health and wellness language than before.\n\nBut it does come from the same place misogyny and women not haveing the right to just be.\n\nMen do get it too, I'm just not as well versed on the societal motivations behind it.", "I think it\u2019s always been around.  I was extremely thin in the 90s and was harassed for it.  As someone whose been thin and fat, I\u2019ve found the thin shaming nastier.

There is always a reason to shame women.

The stories were honestly disturbing. \"You look like I could just throw you around in bed.\" \"... I'm thin because I'm dying of cancer.\" That kind of shit.

So shut it", "Oh and don't forget that even if you became the perfect woman, some asshole is going to come up, unprovoked, and tell you that he likes non-traditional beauty standard x better than your perfection.
