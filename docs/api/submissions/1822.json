And even if you are willing to forgive your mom, your fiancee has to be 100% on board with allowing them to attend.\n\nAgain it's up to the two of you, but I'd say mom has to make a genuine apology for a start, and specifically to promise never to say another WORD about your fiancee's figure, period.\n\nIf you don't care about your side of the family attending, then just leave it.", "NTA.

While it's unfortunate, I think that if she was invited to your wedding, she would do or say something awful.  For your fiancee's sake, I wouldn't invite her.  Not to mention the fact that your fiancee tried to involve her and she only got vicious behavior in response.  In fact, I'd make it clear to your mom that her own behavior got her uninvited.", "Well, They won't be showing up then.", "First off corpse bride kick ass\n\n\nSo put that in your book for reference\n\n\n\nSecond she needs to pipe up with the quick comebacks\n\n\nJust sayin", "\"The entire week my phone has been blowing up with messages from my whole family saying that half of them won't show up if I continue to be cruel to my mom.\"\n\nYour mom & aunt have been cruel with Jess for ages and if your family members are okay with that, I say it's a good thing they won't be there.

It would be a bummer if your mom can't attend - especially since your fiance wanted your mom there and she may feel responsible for them not coming - but ultimately, this event is for you and your soon-to-be wife and you shouldn't have anyone there that makes it unpleasant for either of you. As far as what your mom and aunt said...that sucks. I think there is this idea that body shaming is acceptable or even appreciated if it is directed toward thinner individuals. They may have a hard time understanding that their words are just as hurtful as if they told an overweight woman that she looked like Miss Piggy in a wedding dress and yet that is almost certainly something they would know not to say. \n\nAs a thinner lady myself, I have always gotten shit from my family. Sometimes genuine concern but usually the basic \"someone get this girl a sandwich!\"  I can understand the genuine concern, but the jokes are annoying and they get old fast. It's frustrating that making comments about my weight and eating habits is fine but if I were to say anything remotely similar about my sister (on the heavier side), I would definitely be an insensitive asshole. \n\n I think if you've made it clear that these comments are not acceptable and they are unwilling to respect that, it is perfectly reasonable to uninvite them. Hopefully they can gain some perspective on the harmful nature of their words and make changes so as to not miss out on a relationship with you and your fiance.", "NTA. I... I just can't.

They attempt to connect with them and try to make them feel welcomed. Even if they don't \\*like\\* the person, per se, they'll still treat him or her with a minimum basic respect. They understand that marriage means drastic rearrangement of one's interpersonal priorities, because your spouse - as a (hopefully) lifelong companion through life's trials and tribulations - is equally as important as your parents, and ought to be treated as such. \n\n'Monsters', on the other hand, see their child getting married as a threat. Such women view the spouse as a wicked usurper, threatening her place in their child's life. They therefore attempt to assert power over him or her, securing their own place by bullying their victim into submission. Success establishes the mother as 'dominant', shunting the spouse into a distinct - and distant - second place. \n\nThis is what your mom is trying to do. Don't let her get away with it.

What?!!??? Allowing you mother to be part of the wedding should not equal throw all boundaries or knowledge of toxic habits away. People who have behaviors like your mother don\u2019t often just change, it takes a lot of work, the willingness to do so, and often tons of therapy to address certain toxic behaviors. Yes you mom is an AH, but you both already knew that.  You were very aware. It\u2019s not uncommon for families to have members with toxic or rude antisocial traits. Families are complicated. It\u2019s your choice in how to maneuver. This maneuver was not smart.  I think some personal responsibility would be helpful here. You both created this situation because you were already well aware that your mother had an issue she was unable to curb and you went along ignoring this.  She is your mother so I understand why you wanted her to be involved in your wedding.  IF you want your mother to be involved either now (sounds like you don\u2019t) or in the future, you need to be very conscious on how to include her, learn to be better aware of boundaries.  You need to accept she has an issue (as in not be in denial about it). You need to be strategic in how you include her. As far as what you choose to do with your wedding and whither your an asshole or not\u2026listen, your mothers behavior was around long before the wedding. It\u2019s likely rooted in deeply rooted insecurity and is likely not just going to suddenly change. Whatever you do, is really you and your fianc\u00e9s choice. But I do think a better questions to be asking to help navigate decisions  is \u201cwhat kind of outcome do we seek, and what to we want to accomplish, what is the dynamic we want to create how can we move in the direction to create that?\u201d  (This is a big picture question not just wedding).  As opposed to \u201cam I the asshole?\u201d IF your think about it and for what ever reason your vision of this involves your mom and half your family still attending, I would suggest it be on the condition that your mother profusely apologize,  ( like a huge $$$ gift for ruining that moment ) and her inclusion being at arms length at the wedding and with other relatives helping keep the distance and peace. This of coarse is given that your fianc\u00e9 would feel even remotely  comfortable with your mother there. You wouldn\u2019t be an asshole if you decided to bar your mother and aunt either\u2026all options will have consequences\u2026it\u2019s just choices\u2026I would just recommend making them with vision and intention, Not with anger  \u2026my two cents.\n\n\nEdited for clarity", "Your mother is the cruel one.

Just like that.  It isn't up to them to regulate your relationship with an abusive parent.  Have a wonderful and joyful wedding.", "NTA, but think through carefully what your next steps will be.  Your mother and aunt's behavior is absolutely terrible . . . the worst.  And, they have been warned multiple times, so there is absolutely no excuse.  Family members who have no doubt only heard their side of the story are now inserting themselves in a situation, judging and giving ultimatums when they have truly no clue, probably, what is going on.  They are terrible too to make assumptions.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would write a letter that describes this issue fully from when it first began, your pleas for their behavior to stop, and then culminating in what happened when they went dress shopping.  Make sure to describe how your mother and aunt's behavior has affected you and your fianc\u00e9 emotionally.  End with why you have decided they are not invited . . . to avoid the very high likelihood that they will ruin the wedding.  You may consider explaining that while you love your mom and aunt you no longer trust them and question whether they have the ability to control their own actions, and why they would do something they know hurts someone you love, which indirectly hurts you.\n\nThis will probably be a milestone in lack of contact with your aunt and mother, but at least the rest of the family will have your side and full knowledge of the circumstances in which to make a decision on which side they stand.  Such a sad situation.  You have my sympathies.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a narcissist. Even when you tell her not to do something, she does it anyways. Even when you called her after the fitting, she sounds like she made no attempt to apologize or anything. She was adamant that what she did was acceptable and clearly will never learn. Your only option at this point is to go NC/LC. Any family who sides with your mom either don\u2019t know the full story or arent worth having at your wedding. Never feel bad for prioritizing your wife like this. Thats the whole point of the marriage.", "NTA. Let the trash take itself out and keep them away from the poor bride. Hug her for me", "Tell your mom that she and your aunt need to stop being mean. Easy as pie. If it\u2019s not helpful, kind and necessary, just STFU.", "NTA", "NTA. It's so nice for the trash to take themselves out! (in reference to the family agreeing with the bodyshamers)", "They have had plenty of chances before to learn their lesson. There comes a time when the stakes are too high to continue to deal with their behavior. Even if they do better from now until the wedding who's to say on the day of they feel confident they won't get kicked out and unleash it then? They had zero issues doing it in front of her family what would stop them from doing it at the wedding? Nothing at that point. They will think OP won't do anything because they have gotten away with it over and over again. So how many more chances should OP give them?", "Why would the fiancee be getting that email?", "That\u2019s what Botox is for \ud83d\ude44", "WHOOPS, yes I meant Kacey!", "NTA. Your mother and aunt are jerks. Good for you for standing up to them.", "NTA.", "Tell the people what your mother did. Easy fix", "I am not skinny, but it always shocks me when people feel that they can comment on someone who is thins body type without consequences and repercussions. You don't need to tell anyone they are too fat. You don't need to tell anyone they are too skinny/tall/short/ anything.", "NTA. If your family is backing your horrible mother, you don\u2019t want them there either anyway.", "As a woman who has had those comments my entire life due to having a super fast metabolism I thank you for sticking up for your fianc\u00e9. Idk how this is still happening where skinny shaming is fine but fat shaming is taboo. They\u2019re both wrong! Also, a corpse bride? Are they 12 year olds?! Probably jealous that your fianc\u00e9 can stay thin and eat anything she wants. \n\nNTA of course", "NTA, my MIL ruined a lot of wedding stuff for me, and baby stuff, and other stuff lol in very different ways but still.  You and your wife will have a much better experience without her than trying to include her because of family obligation.  Your wife made a huge gesture and you mom crapped all over it, neither of you ever have to feel guilty about uninviting her.  Tell the rest of your family what happened and if they still side with your mom you're better off without them.", "NTA \n\nIf it was me in your situation I'd done the same. They choose to disrespect your wife to be and by proxy disrespecting you too. It also tell you they clearly would never except her as one of the family anyways. \n\nAs for the half of your family, If they willing to condone bad behaviour like that fuck them you don't need them their either. \n\nGo and have a brilliant wedding day and forget about them.", "I agree that OP did the right thing and if OPs has family members that find it better to defend the bad behavior and not show up, so be it.  It will mean that the true family and friends are the ones that will be there and OP and Jess will have a much better chance to have a great wedding.", "Apparently \"heroin chic\" is back, according to big news outlet so big yikes we can't even exist at this point, you have a body? well you shouldn't !", "People are awful about weight issues with both sexes and it is completely unacceptable to insert their opinion when it isn't asked.  Women have to deal with enough without bullshit from their peers."]}
