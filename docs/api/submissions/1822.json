Jess has always been very thin. No, she does not have an ED or an unhealthy relationship with food. She just has always been petite weight and height-wise. My mom has always made comments on the side, saying that Jess needs to eat more and often serves her more than Jess asks for, which makes her uncomfortable. As a result of that, I have gone low contact with my mom, and we had a long discussion on why before I did it with the hopes she would fix her behavior. \n\nWhen Jess and I got engaged, Jess emphasized that she really wanted my mom to at least be a part of the wedding because, after all, she is my mom. Last Saturday, she went dress shopping with my mom, my aunt, her mother, my sister, and a few of her friends. When she came home, she hurried into the bathroom, and I could hear her crying in the shower. I knocked, but she said she wanted space, so I let her be. I called her mom to see what happened at the dress fitting and her mother sounded fuming. Apparently, my mom and aunt thought it would be appropriate to tell Jess that she looked like the corpse bride (Tim Burton film). It turned into a giant argument between my sister and Jess's mom against my aunt and mother. It ruined the whole special moment for Jess. I called my mother and reamed into her for her behavior and told her that she proved once again why we were low contact. She argued with me till I told her that she and my aunt were banned from attending the wedding due to their behavior. She started sobbing, saying that she needed to attend her baby's wedding. I hung up because I didn't care. The entire week my phone has been blowing up with messages from my whole family saying that half of them won't show up if I continue to be cruel to my mom.

Good on you sticking up for your fiance", "NTA\n\nShe had her warning from the earlier bout of low/no contact. She did this to herself.\n\nIf you do allow her to attend the wedding, make sure she knows what the rules are and what is automatic grounds for removal.", "NTA, half the wedding.....half the cost. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I love it when trash takes itself out, less work you. Congratulations and I hope the rest of the wedding planning is less stressful (block everyone that agrees with your mom & aunt)", "NTA. You have Jess's back as you should if you're going to be her husband. Keep doing that. Your mom and aunt were horrible to Jess and don't blame you one but for not wanting to invite them to your special day if all they're going to do is tear her down. And the rest of the family who say they won't come if your mother and aunt aren't there? Well, you know who's side they are on and can stay there.", "Your mom and aunt's consistent attitude, which they could easily fix, makes you and your fianc\u00e9 uncomfortable to the point of not wanting to be around them. NTA for not wanting them at your wedding. If they were pleasant to be around you would gladly invite them.", "NTA well done for sticking up for Jess. I've seen to many posts on here about mama's boys on here siding with their idiot mothers", "NTA.  She\u2019s being abusive to your soon to be wife.", "NTA.\n\nYou are defending your fiancee.  And even if you are willing to forgive your mom, your fiancee has to be 100% on board with allowing them to attend.\n\nAgain it's up to the two of you, but I'd say mom has to make a genuine apology for a start, and specifically to promise never to say another WORD about your fiancee's figure, period.\n\nIf you don't care about your side of the family attending, then just leave it.", "NTA. I don\u2019t see why your mom is so infatuated with your fianc\u00e9s figure? It\u2019s weird to be that obsessive over it. Sorry this is happening to you bud. You aren\u2019t the asshole here at all.", "OMG, NTA!  I'm so glad your almost wife has you, and that you see your mother and her issues clearly.  While it's unfortunate, I think that if she was invited to your wedding, she would do or say something awful.  For your fiancee's sake, I wouldn't invite her.  Not to mention the fact that your fiancee tried to involve her and she only got vicious behavior in response.  In fact, I'd make it clear to your mom that her own behavior got her uninvited.", "Well, They won't be showing up then.", "First off corpse bride kick ass\n\n\nSo put that in your book for reference\n\n\n\nSecond she needs to pipe up with the quick comebacks\n\n\nJust sayin", "\"The entire week my phone has been blowing up with messages from my whole family saying that half of them won't show up if I continue to be cruel to my mom.\"\n\nYour mom & aunt have been cruel with Jess for ages and if your family members are okay with that, I say it's a good thing they won't be there. You don't need people in your life who doesn't respect your stbw.\n\nAnd thank you for standing up for Jess. Wish you and her the best \u2764", "NTA at all, but... totally up to you, of course, you know your mother best, but I'd be intrigued by the possibility that your threat alone has hammered the point home to her, and that you are in an excellent position to lay down the law at a moment when she's really listening. \n\nWho knows, you might end up with an absolutely meek and brilliantly-behaved mum at your wedding, which is the ideal. On the other hand, you may also get confirmation of her stubborn refusal to change, which would be your cue to carry on with NC.", "NTA. It would be a bummer if your mom can't attend - especially since your fiance wanted your mom there and she may feel responsible for them not coming - but ultimately, this event is for you and your soon-to-be wife and you shouldn't have anyone there that makes it unpleasant for either of you. As far as what your mom and aunt said...that sucks. I think there is this idea that body shaming is acceptable or even appreciated if it is directed toward thinner individuals. They may have a hard time understanding that their words are just as hurtful as if they told an overweight woman that she looked like Miss Piggy in a wedding dress and yet that is almost certainly something they would know not to say. \n\nAs a thinner lady myself, I have always gotten shit from my family. Sometimes genuine concern but usually the basic \"someone get this girl a sandwich!\"  I can understand the genuine concern, but the jokes are annoying and they get old fast. It's frustrating that making comments about my weight and eating habits is fine but if I were to say anything remotely similar about my sister (on the heavier side), I would definitely be an insensitive asshole. \n\n I think if you've made it clear that these comments are not acceptable and they are unwilling to respect that, it is perfectly reasonable to uninvite them. Hopefully they can gain some perspective on the harmful nature of their words and make changes so as to not miss out on a relationship with you and your fiance.", "NTA. I... I just can't. The Corpse Bride?!? Your mom and aunt were insanely offensive! Like they didn't know that would upset your fiancee. Dress shopping is supposed to be a magical moment for the bride. I hope she gets to find that (version 2.0) with a supportive, loving crowd. \n\nSounds like your wedding will be great without all of those toxic people there!", "NTA\n\nYou mom and aunt behaved outrageously. Why they think they are entitled to invitations after that, is mystifying. \n\nThey owe your fiancee a HUGE apology at the very least. And they need to STFU about her appearance permanently.", "NTA\n\nThat's beyond disgusting they would act like that. And good riddance to whatever family agrees they were ok doing what they did. Send a group text to everyone that's called and ask for a head count if who agrees with your mom as they don't need to be there either. It's not an energy you need to have around on your wedding day.", "Nta. Stand up for your soon to be wife. You've told your mother to back off and she refused.", "NTA, good riddance to whichever (invited) guests don't show up", "NTA. She was always going to continue with this abuse until there were consequences. It amazes me how people who behave badly think they can get away with it if they get enough people to gang up on you. You've got a wonderful future to look forward to - don't let them spoil any of it for you. They don't deserve to be there.", "*This message is to everyone in the family who is considering boycotting my wedding.  I need to know by the end of the week whether or not you are attending.  If you do not tell me that you are still attending by 5pm on Sunday, your invitation will be revoked and security will turn you away at the door.  Also, anyone who chooses to not attend will be permanently removed from my life much as my mother and my aunt will be.  Please let me know by Sunday whether or not you choose to be a part of my life or you choose to defend the behavior of my immature and toxic mother and aunt.  This is not up for discussion.  My mind is made up and there is no coming back from what my mom and aunt did.  They dug this hole and now they have to live in it.  Actions have consequences in life.  I await everyone's responses.*\n\nNTA", "Not at all! You are in the right. You're wedding day is about you and your fianc\u00e9 becoming y'alls own family.", "NTA - \u201cHer baby,\u201d doesn\u2019t want her there. And with very good reason.", "NTA. And Tell the people who said they are not gonna gobto your wedding, that way you pay less and are gonna enjoy you wedding with the people Who really LOVE and suport bouth of you.", "NTA. Your mom and aunt were unbelievably cruel and you stood up for your fiance. They don't deserve to be at your wedding.", "You're absolutely right. Fat shaming is more common, but also thin shaming is a thing (and both are wrong).", "Exactly, whoever supports OP's mum for being cruel to his future wife doesn't need to come to the wedding either.\n\nWhat is it with some parents who go crazy when their \"baby\" is about to get married that they even become cruel... I will never understand it.\n\nNTA, and don't believe the \"sobbing\". It's crocodile tears, nothing more. Block them all to have some peace. AND my deepest respect for how you protect your fianc\u00e9, may you always protect and love each other like that!"]}
