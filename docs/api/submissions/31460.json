{"id": 31460, "submission_id": "180yoc8", "title": "AITA for always letting my middle daughter choose her room/bed first on vacations?", "selftext": " My husband and I have 4 kids, Evan (20), Adriana (16), Elizabeth (15), and Michael (15). We try to travel 3-4 times a year. \n\n3 years ago, the night before we were supposed to leave, my friend told us we couldn\u2019t use her cabin anymore. We were all looking for new places and Adriana sent a listing for this small town in the middle of nowhere. We ignored it the first few times she sent it but she eventually talked us into looking at it and it was perfect. We paid a little over $200 a night for a beautiful cabin on the lake with a game room and enough beds to allow everyone to get their own bed. The people were great, the drive wasn\u2019t bad, and there was actually a lot of things to do there. It\u2019s become one of our favorite vacation spots. \n\nWhen Adriana was 14, we pretty much started letting her book family vacations. She had to run everything by us first but she was the one that chose where we went and where we stayed. Her only condition is that she gets first pick for rooms/beds. She\u2019s even booked an international vacation for us, including flights and a rental car. \n\nWe\u2019ve given the other kids opportunities to help with vacations. They all know if they can find a place that we\u2019d want to go to and stay within a budget, they can get first dibs if we book it. The problems are that they have a hard time sticking to a budget or they're set on a specific place even if it's not suitable for everyone. They\u2019ll pick a hotel or rental that\u2019s nearly the entire (or over the) vacation budget or doesn\u2019t have enough rooms because it has a specific feature. Because of this, we almost always go with Adriana's choice. We recently spent 3 nights in a cabin with 3 bedrooms. 2 rooms had a king bed and an en suite. 3rd had 4 twin beds. Adriana chose one of the rooms with the king beds. There was a pull out couch available but none of them wanted it. \n\nAfter we left, they were upset that Adriana got her own room and bathroom while the rest of them had to share. I told them they know the deal and that if they can find a place for everyone, stay within budget, and pick a place that we\u2019d all want to go to, they can also choose their room and bed. They say they try but we always pick Adriana\u2019s listings. I told them her listings are usually more practical. We paid a little under $600 for the cabin that we stayed at after taxes and fees. It had so many free activities nearby that the entire 3 day vacation for 6 people came out to just under $1000. They can\u2019t beat it with a $1800 listing with 2 beds and a single bathroom. \n\nThey think we\u2019re being unfair and should rotate who books the vacations and chooses the rooms but I just don\u2019t have that kind of money to throw away and I\u2019m not going to deal with the fighting that\u2019ll inevitably come when they pick a place with not enough beds or bathrooms.", "created_utc": 1700620511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180yoc8/aita_for_always_letting_my_middle_daughter_choose/", "score": 874, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She found a place that comfortably accommodated 50 percent of the people and because you, your husband and your daughter made up that 50 percent you are all happy with it. Three of you got the king beds with the en ensuites and the other three had to share a room and and presumably the general bathroom. That is crap. I wouldn\u2019t book that for my friends and not expect them to resent me. Why are you surprised that your other three kids are resentful. \n\nYou are the parents. Your kids are getting old enough that pretty soon they are going to be able to opt out of family vacations. You seem to be going merrily along w this system of yours making your own happy memories.

At the very least your daughter should have been forced to share w one of the other two.", "YTA\u2026 more I look at OPs replies, the more it seems the problem is OP not Adrianna. \n\nOP only cares about money and doesn\u2019t care about what the children. Adrianna is just a pawn in this cause she likes this stuff but unfortunately is causing her relationship with life her siblings to go South. As long as it cheap, OP will take it and it\u2019s likely that even if the rest came with a location just $100 more, she would take the cheaper option.", "AITA? I don\u2019t care what anyone says I\u2019m not TA! Why ask the question when you\u2019ve decided you aren\u2019t TA and just keep maintaining your position regardless of people\u2019s responses? This has already created resentment between your kids and this resentment will grow as the kids get older. I think you must be a troll because no decent parent cares so little about all but one child.", "YTA - The issue isn't that she gets to pick first, it's that you allowed her to occupy the room by herself. Her choice should have been that she could either share with someone in the room with four beds or she could share with someone in the room with the king size bed.\n\nA sole private room is not part of your agreement.", "YTA. You let her book a place with 2 rooms with king beds and one bunk room and then gave her the private room and bath? While the other 3 kids  (including 2 boys a girl) shared a room and bath? Bullshit. No wonder they are pissed. Plan your own vacations.", "YTA. And all of your arguing and right fighting in the comments proves it repeatedly.", "Yes YTA but judging by your self righteous and \"I'm right you're all wrong\" attitude I don't even understand why you're here? \n\nYou're not here for honest feedback because you get an attitude with everyone who criticizes you.. You believe you're 100% right, so why are you here? \n\nI personally think you're a jerk of a parent. Your husband too since it takes 2. I think you CLEARLY have a favourite. That favouritsm could be a result of your pure laziness but it's still there. \n\nI feel especially bad for your teenage daughter who's forced to share a bathroom/bedroom with 2 teenage boys while her sister is living lavishly in a room all to herself. \n\nEvery day I come on Reddit and I'm reminded that my mother really wasn't that bad. There's always a mother like you who is a total asshole. But hey! On the bright side as soon as they're old enough the 3 ignored/unfavoured children will definitely stop coming on vacation with you guys and you and your favourite daughter can have a blast.  Be that she plans everything of course.\n\nBut I'm sure you'll be one of those \"I don't know what happened, I gave them everything.\" Parents. \n\nI see where Adriana gets her selfishness from. You sound like a teenager yourself. Why should she look out for her siblings too when her own selfish mother doesn't. \n\nApple and tree and all.", "I was on the fence until reading your replies/comments.\nYou don't care if it meets all the needs as long as they meet yours, which is why you're having such a young girl planning family vacations in the first place. You also repeatedly dismiss the needs of your other children, saying a bed and a roof is all they need.\nYTA. You're also the parent... Plan the vacations yourself.", "YTA. I mean you can\u2019t possibly think that this sort of arrangement is fair for any of the other kids. This is how animosity starts among siblings, when parents clearly show preferential treatment towards one child. If you really wanted to make it \u201cfair\u201d for everyone, you would have offered assistance to ALL your kids. This is basically just Adriana\u2019s vacation where you benefit from it and the siblings are just dragged along.", "YTA. Adriana is choosing places purposefully that ensure she has a single room and amenities and where her siblings will be uncomfortable. She chose somewhere that did not fit the needs of the family and you let her because she is \"better\" at booking vacations. \n\nAt the bare minimum, the two girls could have shared and the two boys. Putting a 15 year old young lady in with two young men so that the favorite can have her own king sized bed tells your other kids exactly where they stand.", "YTA. Don't travel 3-4 times a year if you don't have the money to make fair sleeping arrangements for your kids. Make it 2-3 and let your other kids have some say.", "YTA here. Your middle child is good at this stuff and instead of teaching your other two or even having her help out, the middle child finishes obviously every time and you go with it without considering fairness. \n\nShe\u2019s honestly being mean by forcing her two siblings to bunk while taking the big bed. And she knows it. \n\nHave a rotation on who gets to pick accommodation and don\u2019t let your middle child butt in on it. If it\u2019s unequal and the siblings don\u2019t agree on rooms then don\u2019t just favour the middle child; parent and help make it even. \n\nIf your other two struggle, help them. Don\u2019t go back on your teenage daughter and say \u2018well, you didn\u2019t do well so this is why we\u2019ll go with hers!\u2019", "You have set up a system to ensure one child  gets preferential treatment.  Not ok.", "Her siblings can't plan as well as she... but neither can you. \n\nIt sounds like you're causing resentment to build amongst the other kids. YOU like the deals she gets, YOU have the final say. Why don't you limit the \"dibs\" between your room and her room, and let the other kids first get equal and equitable rooms, since you think your daughter needs to be constantly rewarded? \n\nYour other kids are not going to want to go on trip with you soon. You are choosing to not go with their choices, you don't help them to be better at planning, you're just creating favoritism.  Also, if she's choosing places that have to be split awkwardly, maybe she doesn't really care about great planning if she never has to deal with any downsides to her booking. her siblings bear the brunt of any poor accommodations, since i'm sure you and your spouse get the second best room.", "YTA. If you genuinely believe this to be fair, then you should take the crappy room or pullout sometimes, since you\u2019re not doing the research either. \n\nIt\u2019s actually more fair if the person booking has no say over where they sleep, because then they\u2019re incentivized to find something that is as equitable as possible. How do you know she couldn\u2019t find an even nicer place in budget with one king suite and two bunk rooms? That\u2019s a very common set up. She was incentivized to disregard them knowing a second suite would benefit her when the time came to choose rooms.\n\nYour other kids just sound bad at math and/or research and/or strategy, which is unfortunate, but not a good reason to keep  giving them the short end of the stick. I\u2019m sure their future therapists will agree.", "YTA. Instead of this awful system, have each child plan one vacation per year. Instead of saying no to the other children immediately, TEACH THEM how to stay in budget and how to plan for the family.", "YTA but not for letting Adriana pick, but that she gets to pick and it\u2019s a guaranteed solo room. It should have still been 2 per room, she can pick which room. Otherwise maybe start planning as a family more or be more specific in your housing choices in the future. This only has to happen once to grow resentment, better not to feed it.", "YTA. It\u2019s quite clear who the golden child is.", "YTA. Why are you arguing with everyone who says that YTA? What\u2019s the point of making this post if you already have decided that NTA?", "YTA. Taking vacation suggestions is fine, but having one child have the winning choice and preferential treatment in bedrooms for every trip is a recipe for resentment. Why can\u2019t you as the adult assist the other kids in how to create realistic vacation plans? I\u2019ve seen this happen time and again when parents have blatant favourites, the golden child turns into an adult asshole.", "YTA.  You should not let any of your kids have this much power over planning family vacations, let alone allow one child to make the majority of the decisions.  \n\n\nLet them each make recommendations or suggestions, but having them actually *book* accommodations is ridiculous.", "Why did you bother posting this? You\u2019ve gotten a resounding YTA and all you are trying to do is justify yourself. YTA. Accept it and move on.", "YTA. You are a s*** parent. You blatantly favor Adriana and it\u2019s gross, I feel sorry for your other kids.", "YTA. Your daughter picks places that meet your minimum requirement and gives her what she wants. She does not consider her siblings. Having 3 children share 1 room and giving the 4th significantly better accommodation is not fair. \n\nShe did the work so she should be rewarded. She should not be rewarded at the cost of the other children. \n\nGood luck convincing your other 3 children to go on holiday with you as adults.", "Soft YTA - this is super unfair to your other children \u2026 you need to offer to pay Adriana a travel agent fee or some other incentive for the work she\u2019s doing.", "YTA and you don\u2019t seem to care much for your children other than Adrianna. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t see much of them in the foreseeable future. \n\nYou let a nice idea (help with planning, get first dibs) completely derail. Change the rules to ensure all kids will enjoy.", "YTA\n\nWhy not teach them how to plan vacations? Or\u2026 you can plan it as a family so everyone is able to sleep comfortably??? Your oldest has figured out how to plan her dream vacation every time by making sure it\u2019s at or below budget. Yeah your younger two are planning extravagant trips, and no you don\u2019t have to agree to those trips. But they should be able to enjoy the trips regardless of who plans them. This sounds less like she\u2019s good at planning and more like you\u2019re lazy.", "YTA- perhaps you could be the adult, book accomodation yourself and ensure your children get equal treatment\u2026", "YTA. It's your responsibility as the parents to make sure that your children are treated equally. It's not fair that Adriana gets the better rooms because you don't want to book your family vacations. Also, is there any chance that Adriana's choices are cheaper because she sticks her siblings with the shitty rooms?", "YTA\n\nIt's OK to get the kids involved with planning but you shouldn't let one decide on all the vacations and get the best room just because she's a better financial planner. You're just doing whatever she wants to do and never let the other kids have a choice on where to go.\n\nLet the other kids pick a destination and you help them find a rental that is within your budget of that is problem.\n\nAnd for now on Adriana deserves the smallest room every time.", "Im exhaustedjust reading that. \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd2e", "YTA. Its almost comical that your kids are directly calling out your favoritism to your face and you think going \"get good losers\" is actual parenting lol have fun continuing to favor the golden child at the expense of your other children's relationships because you are too lazy to book your own vacation and be the adult.", "YTA\n\n> When Adriana was 14, we pretty much started letting her book family vacations. She had to run everything by us first but she was the one that chose where we went and where we stayed. \n\nStop **letting her** choose places that don't provide **equal** accommodations for *all* her siblings.\n\n> We recently spent 3 nights in a cabin with 3 bedrooms. 2 rooms had a king bed and an en suite. 3rd had **4 twin beds.** \n\nYou *never* should have signed off on that in the first place.", "Why did u asked, if u don't accept that u're letting your daughter created sibbling rivalry? Honestly, start planning yourbown vacations without Adriana's input and lets see if she will like too share a small room and others?!?!", "I\u2019m confused, why is a condition of her getting to pick that she ALSO gets to pick her room. She\u2019s choosing where you go AND gets to pick the room she wants?", "YTA, my parents did basically this exact thing. 4 kids and my older sister *always* chose. I'm an adult and can be mature about it now but even still, when I think about it my reaction is still being fucking livid before I chill out.", "YTA \n\nI would tell the other two to just plan a few sleepovers and not go.\n\n A brother and sister at 15 should not be staying in the same room. \n\nThe eldest is your golden child. The bedroom situation is inappropriate and needs to be addressed over the price. If it is too much, go on fewer vacations like an adult and parent.", "YTA. I understand that Adriana picks out good vacations within budget but that shouldn\u2019t put the rest of your kids at that much of a disadvantage. Adriana getting a king size bed while the rest of them get twins, a pull out mattress and one bathroom for three is completely unfair. Yes she picked it out but that is such an extreme difference. If she got a double and everyone else got a twin and the girls shared a bathroom as did the boys perhaps the reception would be more NTA. That however is not the case. This is clear favoritism and shows that she is prioritizing herself and you guys are enabling it. Again, the difference in treatment is ridiculous. The girls should have shared the king and the bathroom whereas the boys got the other bathroom and twins. So much more fair and it still ensures she gets dibs.", "YTA. Enjoy the shit nursing home you get booked at.", "Wow. YTA, and so are all of your comments defending your actions and not seeing how unbelievably wrong you're being to the rest of your family. \n\nStop favoring her, you are actively destroying your relationships with your other children. Like, permanently. They will remember this and resent the FUCK out of it.", "YTA.  Way to cause division between your kids. You're treating one like the favored princess and giving the others the leftovers.  Enjoy having them shut you out of their lives, probably sooner than later.\n\nAdriana has you figured out to a tee and will continue to book places that favor her while giving her middle finger to her siblings.", "YTA Pretty clear who is the golden child here.", "Yta simple as that. Stop playing favoritism. Stop punishing the other kids and grow up. Based on your previous comments, you definitely are defensive. Why did you even post?  You take no accountability for your blatant favoritism that everyone on here is telling you about.", "YTA. This is just weird honestly. I\u2019ve never heard of a teen being able to choose the vacations for the whole family and getting first dibs. Idk but it just feel off. Is Adriana your favorite or something? She\u2019s obviously trying to make sure she always has the best accommodations but doesn\u2019t care about where her siblings end up.", "YTA. You really need to admit you don\u2019t want to do the work planning a trip. You are creating unnecessary hatred between the kids. They are punished 3-4 times a year because your golden child knows how to save a few bucks. Did you ever think to teach them how to book trips? Eventually they will refuse to go on the trips. Don\u2019t act surprised when they go LC.", "YTA. The kids all need to take turns sharing. Not everyone is good at travel planning, it\u2019s just cruel to punish them for that. Yes they \u201cwill survive\u201d a few nights sharing a room but the relationships within the family probably won\u2019t survive very long with the way you are parenting.", "YTA, the issue isn't that you let her pick first - she should be sharing accommodations like her siblings do", "YTA how can you not see she chooses which places have enough accommodations for you and your SO and herself.", "YTA. There's a fair way to manage accommodation in this situation, and you're clearly giving preferential treatment to one child. All you're going to do is create long term resentment and animosity between your kids and also towards you.\n\nAs for your points where you've said you're not paying double for the kids to be equal, it doesn't require you to pay double - it requires you to be fair... and BTW putting money before y9ur kids emotional well-being is equally gross.", "YTA \n\nIf you bothered being a parent, you wouldn\u2019t have any problems.

The next vacation, you need to leave Adriana out of it completely. One of the other kids needs to come up with a plan but you will look for a backup in case they can\u2019t find one that meets your needs. Give them many chances if they keep missing the mark. They need the chance to learn this without just getting shot down and going with Adriana\u2019s pick every time. If they can\u2019t find one my a certain time, then you go with your pick (and you need to leave Adriana out of the selection process completely) and then figure out rooms and beds from there.\n\nYTA but you could start making it better if you wanted to.\n\nI also saw someone suggest taking fewer vacations if that would increase the budget. That\u2019s a good idea. 2 bigger vacations rather than 3-4 smaller ones could help.", "YTA\n\nI just wouldn't go with you anymore. You're showing clear favoritism.", "YTA - perhaps you plan your own vacations for the family, assign rooms, and put the kids on equal footing.", "YTA\n\nIf your other kids aren't as good at the financial planning aspect teach them how to be. In your own words they always go beyond budget. That can be a huge issue for them when they get older and it's your responsibility as a parent to teach them proper financial management. \n\nWhat an incredible learning opportunity and bonding moment to share with your other children. Help them each individually plan a vacation and give them guidance and aid when it's needed.", "This is a joke right? Who lets a child plan and book a whole vacation? Act like the adults and plan your own vacation jfc.\n\nYTA", "YTA", "YTA. Clearly Adrianna isn't picking rentals that are big enough.\n\nI get vacations are expensive, but that comes with the territory of having to rent a place that can house 6, uncomfortably at that. The only ones to blame for that is you.\n\nMaybe start rejecting some of Adrianas picks if they are uncomfortable for your other kids.\n\nTravel less to afford better options.", "YTA.\n\nI grew up with abusive parents who would constantly try to pit me and myself against each other so that we don\u2019t have anyone to rely on. As we got older, we learned their tactics and realized the years of bonding and good friendship we could\u2019ve had if our parents didn\u2019t do all that drama. You might think this arrangement is benefiting your vacations but it is at the expensive of your childrens\u2019 bond. They will come to resent your middle daughter and create tension in the family that could easily be avoided if you let them all with together. For example, your daughter can be in charge of the overall planning but the siblings can help creating a list of potential options, creating the presentation, and ticking off requirements.", "NTA the other kids shouldn't be entitled. They must put in the work. Otherwise Adria must just stop organizing vacations", "YTA, she's a kid, not a travel agent. You're rewarding her for doing what should be your job, obviously that's going to cause confict with your kids.", "YTA.

Why do 3 people have to share a room when one of your kids gets a whole room and a king sized bed? You're ruining your kids relationship with each other as well as alienating the 3 others from you.

She is a selfish narcissist as it is. If she wasn't, she would pick hotel arrangements that would accommodate everyone in the family equally. And her selfishness is getting enabled by her parent. Wtf! Get ready for your other kids to absolutely resent you.", "You're making the others resent you and Adriana by making them feel like they're treated unfairly. If money is an issue, reduce the number of vacations. If Adriana can find affordable places for the vacation and you're not, it means you weren't looking hard enough. If her looking for places works for you, find other ways to reward her for the work of finding them. On the surface, it seems fair because a deal is a deal, but it's not fair to the others for her to have the big room with a kingsize bed while the other 3 have to share a room or one of them to sleep on the couch. That's why I think YTA. Act like a family and not like an auction where the lowest bidder wins.", "NTA. This is smart and fair.

It's fine that she gets dibs on choosing room/bed. It is NOT fine that in that specific situation she got the WHOLE room and bathroom to herself while three of her siblings had to share.

Admit it or shut it.", "NTA they all get a chance to find budget places and   no one slept on the floor. Yea it could have been two and two but did anyone else give viable options no. Is anyone else contributing than no. It's not easy paying for 4 kids and 2 adults and there were options. It's not favoritism since you favor being economic and as long as everyone has fun who cares. I didn't always have a bed growing up so they're being stupid.", "YTA if only because your lazimess is causing resentment among your kids. Make the reservations yourself or eliminate the '1st choice of rooms' perk.", "The thing you're forgetting is that this sort of inequality carries on into adult life. And not just who gets what beds. The trust, the preferences, the attitudes. They carry on.\n\nThis is the sort of thing that leads to siblings going no contact. and for life long resentment.\n\nYou're setting up a lifelong scenario here where Adriana comes first. Where she always makes the decisions, and gets her way. You should really be thinking about that. \n\nYTA. I would have said everybody sucks, but your attitude in your comments and replies shows you really don't care. You have a clear favourite.

Even if she picks the place you need to rotate which kid gets first pick of the room", "ESH. Let\u2019s start with the 3 kids getting the short end of the stick. The reason they are AHs is that they were given (doubt it\u2019s \u201care given\u201d simply because it sounds like parents have made up their minds about letting the 3 kids try after the first \u201cfailed\u201d attempt however many years ago) parameters and failed to maintain them. My question is did you, as the parents, sit down with them and work through the reasons WHY their attempt was unacceptable and how to fix it so that the kids would have better luck the next time. I add a caveat regarding the oldest that he likely is only traveling with the family to give the twins someone that they can actually stand to be around at this point. Once the twins no longer travel with you (certainly after they turn 18 and can\u2019t be forced to go), he will probably drop the trips faster than a boiling hot rock. Otherwise he probably would have ditched the vacations due to the now blatant favoritism. Now to the final child. She KNOWS that by giving you the cheapest option that \u201cticks all the boxes\u201d she can manage to swing a better or best room as the prize even though it isn\u2019t a NEED (since you were emphasizing needs versus wants). This makes her an AH because she plans with absolutely no regard for the comfort of her siblings (she clearly knows that no matter what parents are going to get a/the good room). This were to include if one of the other\u2019s manages to do the same. Hers will be automatically accepted because she manages to find a cheaper option that has the things that YOU (and likely she) want to do with no care for what your other kids prefer to do. Guess what, she doesn\u2019t NEED a king size bed with an en-suite. She WANTS a king size bed with an en-suite. If you are going to emphasize needs and wants, they need to apply to EVERYONE. Now for you and your husband. Clearly you WANT to take 3-4 trips per year, otherwise if the trip were to go over budget then you would simply take from the budget of one of the other trips and reduce the number of trips per year. You\u2019re also not hurting too much for money if you can afford that many trips. Most people can barely afford 1 or 2 per year that\u2019s within reasonable driving distance. You threw your other 3 kids into the deep end and let them flounder. I don\u2019t see anything  indicating you sat down with them and worked through WHY their choice wasn\u2019t acceptable. Did you even tell them what the budget was and that it was a HARD budget? Or did you tell them \u201ckeep it to around x-amount\u201d? Did you tell them \u201cwe need at least xyz for accommodation and abc for entertainment, but after that it\u2019s free game\u201d? Or was it simply \u201csomething in x area\u201d? Did it ever occur to you that the trip your youngest daughter tried to plan may have been because a friend of hers talked about the trip their own family did (likely with far fewer people) sounded absolutely awesome to your daughter and she wanted to experience it without realizing that with 6 people the cost was far different? It sounds to me like you and your husband are too lazy to make the effort to plan a fair trip for everyone to experience and have dropped it on your middle daughter as well as failing to teach your other children how to do these things as well. If your oldest even knows enough to survive as an adult on his own, I\u2019d be shocked because it sounds like you don\u2019t care to put in the effort to teach your children good life skills like how to survive in the adult world.

As OP said the siblings found a hotel for $1800 with two bedrooms and one bath, which is most of the budget without food, this is unreasonable.  Adriana is the smart one she has figured out how to maximize the budget with lots of activities nearby.  Sometimes there\u2019s 3 -4 bedrooms with 2 baths.  It\u2019s a vacation you end up with a set #of beds within the room when booking a cabin or condo.  If they were to choose a vacation planned by the other kids there wasn\u2019t enough beds/baths for 6 people but had the features that they wanted.  It\u2019s a luxury to go on vacation every year.

The other 3 would despise the family holidays and once old enough would never go on hols with you for your favouritism.\n\nSeems you assuming 15 years old kids would have the same intuition as Adrianna and that your excuse\u2026. They are kids and might not have the same intuition. You keep saying if they get in the budget, yet there such a discrepancy between their listings , do you give them what is the budget ? Do you give them the criteria needed for the lodge like 2 bathrooms minimum?  Give them pointers what you looking for and they might find better", "But you have enough to go on plenty of vacations in the first place", "I suppose if you mean \u201c misery loves company\u201d in that it\u2019s only okay if they are all doing it, but I still see the whole point is that they made a deal to everyone, and set a pretty clear standard. Now I could see the argument about the parents just picking a better option all together if none are good, but then that could lead to other resentment for deceit or something like that for going back on the word of picking one of the kids vacations, so I mean if I was one of the kids, Id pick a better option after 3 times now \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "She's pretty much pitting her kids against each other because if they ever want the nice room they'd have to screw over their siblings by suggesting a three bedroom place. It seems like so far only Adriana's taken her up on the offer lol", "Nobody ever said she always ends up with a second master suite. She does share rooms. First picks also does have its limitations. She does not get her own room if someone ends up in the living room (not by choice). If one room is considerably smaller and she\u2019s the only one with her own room she gets the small room. There are times where we stay in a place with a bedroom and a bunk room. She still picks which bunk she wants but she shares.", "Elizabeth is 15.  What\u2019s your excuse?", "Why so demanding?", "Go camping?", "Just did with about 5 minutes of research on one website.", "Bro are you surprised? you live in god awful California of all places. 2 nights for 600 dollars, Get your funds up dam you live in cali your check should be inflated like those gas prices. Suprise you be able to get a trailer for 600 for 2 nights on a holiday weekend.", "I mean I guess until they put in real work like Adrianna or pay for it, tough luck? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f They\u2019re lucky they get a vacation, especially in this economy. It\u2019s thanks in part to their sister it happens. My family did it, we were grateful for the experiences. We have wonderful memories. It would\u2019ve been cool for bigger lavish places but oh well. We got what we got.", "Define run everything?\n\nOthers define it differently.", "I agree. I\u2019m 25 and only now understanding how to organize my finances and budget properly while my younger sister has been a natural at it for years. I\u2019m great at math, but she\u2019s great at numbers.", "I agree, at this point why even go on vacation? If I were the kids who get the shaft every time I\u2019d be staying home. Probably would be nice to get a break from my mom who doesn\u2019t give a shit about me.", "The bed in Adriana's room was a king size.  She and her sister could have shared such a large bed.", "Twain Hart is cool, I think more so for younger kids. These kids are too old unless they\u2019re really outdoorsy, to enjoy just being in a rustic cabin if they want things to do other than fish or check out the scenery. \n$600 for two nights in Calif in a biggish place, is a stretch if you\u2019re going somewhere where there\u2019s lots to do. \n\nLet\u2019s give daughter some credit for finding places and dealing with the booking and logistics. But now she\u2019s gotten so good at it (!) she ought to be able to seek out the real bargains - so set her a challenge - no more two king suites and the cupboard under the stairs for everyone else. \n\nOP is lucky her kids especially a 20 year old, still want to traipse around on family vacations. It won\u2019t last much longer if the younger three have to share a room while their sister has her own with a king bed!", "I\u2019d assume they like the vacations. They keep going.", "Odd, because I plan all of the vacations for my immediate family. And a lot of the extended family and friend trips we go on as well. And yet I\u2019ve never once picked a place to stay that so obviously benefited me at the expense of others. You know why? Because I care about those people, I was happy to plan the trip because I was excited to spend time with them, and I wanted them to enjoy themselves as much as me.", "The first dibs rule was set to give them motivation to do the work. It was the payout. Without some kind of payout there\u2019s no reason for the kids to want to do this which is why I think they should just toss this whole thing out to avoid the family strife. I don\u2019t see a happy way to compromise such a complicated system that\u2019s worth all the headache.", "Please explain what condition is in Adriana\u2019s favor? The budget, the space requirement, or the fact that it has to be within driving distance?", "If they want to rotate, they can pay out of their pockets when they go over budget trying to get everything they want.", "Yes, we give them the criteria but they never meet it.", "I commented this elsewhere, but who defines \u201cbetter\u201d? For OP/spouse (who choose before A), it\u2019s cheaper shared accommodations. For the kids (inc A since she never chooses to share), it\u2019s more accommodating lodging even if that means less activities. If the three other sibs band together to all chose more equal accommodations and A games the system by finding a 2BR where she can pick first, the sibs are getting screwed every time.", "None of that makes sense at all. There is zero logic behind that.", "It was the same scenario Adriana booked the cabin in. She found a place with 6 beds, 3 bathrooms, 2 nights, during a holiday weekend, in California, for under 600 including all taxes and fees", "Except Adriana knows she can pick a rental that is too small and op will pick it? And that she gets the best room so why should she care that 3 teens have to share the smallest room by default?\n\nIt's op's fault her vacations are expensive. Sucks but thats part of having a big family.", "You\u2019re skimming over the part where I say I agree with you. OP has the requirement of 5 beds, not me. My point is finding a 3 bedroom house with one en-suite and two kid rooms with multiple beds versus two en-suites is not the Herculean effort some people are making it out to be.", "Yea obviously $600 for a holiday weekend in CA is borderline ridiculous - those were her requirements, not mine. I only posted that to prove it can be done, and that was the first option I found after searching for roughly three minutes. I didn\u2019t even look at the town it was in. I\u2019m not her TA.", "> After we left, they were upset\n\nYou **just said** they're upset about this.", "What\u2019s the rule about assuming?  You make an ass out of u and me.", "Maybe the first dibs rule was set to give them motivation to do the work, but now all it's doing is giving Adriana motivation to find the cheapest place that has a room for her parents, a room for her, and somewhere to shove the rest of her siblings. She knows that if she books somewhere where her parents don't have to share, they literally don't care about what happens to the rest of the children, as long as they get to go on 3 or 4 holidays for the year.\n\nI definitely think you're right - the parents should go back to planning the holidays. It's kinda insane to me that they could go to a place where one child gets their own private king bedroom, with three other kids sharing the other bedroom and they didn't automatically go \"Well, this isn't working out, we'll have to change this up\". Or that they even booked a space with this layout. And then she comes on reddit and is like \"Well, am I an AH for getting one kid to do all the planning and letting her plan our holidays so it's great for me and my husband and her but shit for her siblings?\" Just plan your own damn holidays and don't force your kids to do it if they want things not to be wildly unfair!", "how convenient for Adriana that the best booking had two king suites and one room with singles \ud83d\udc80", "Have you tried teaching them at all or helping them in anyway? Especially since Adriana already has been doing this for years by herself.", "Repeatedly choosing her over her siblings???", "The fact that you decide what fits everyone's needs and always veto theirs. It is obvious to everyone here that you have a favorite child. How is putting a teenage girl in a room with her two brothers something that fits the space requirements to you? It obviously had a feature that's Adriana favored, a room her sibling would have to share if they wanted a real bed and a room she wouldn't have to share because you would let her not only pick the vacation destination, but what rooms everyone got. \n\nWhen Adriana is no longer welcome around her siblings and they barely talk to you, just remember your vacations were worth it because you and your favorite child got what they wanted.", "What the actual fuck", "Are you gonna give them an invoice when they all turn 18? What a shit parent YTA why'd you come here, cuz your other kids are sick of arguing with you?", "Guys Guys, I finally Understand. Shes raising Spartans they need to be tough.", "Food for thought: CHANGE THE CRITERIA TO INCLUDE EQUITABLE SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS.", "Why does the criteria not include equitable sleeping arrangements?", "They shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cmeet criteria.\u201d  Be an adult and do it yourself.", "Totally see this point, but I think she commented earlier saying both the boys picked a place with even worse sleeping accommodation, only 2 bedrooms, so the could have an indoor basketball court and arcade room, and the other sister spent wayyy too much over budget, so in the grand scheme of things, she was definitely way more unbiased compared to the other siblings trying to also plan it the way they want.", "No no no.  What I said is why are YOU so demanding,  because you\u2019d rather bark orders at everyone to get what you want when you\u2019re perfectly capable of doing things on your own.  You\u2019re the parent.  Take responsibility, goddamn.", "And 3 of the people involved had to use one bathroom, while one got her own bathroom and you and you SO got the other.\n\nGod you are so stuck in justifying your favoritism toward one child.", "YTA. Just listen to yourself. Your the parent, you should act like it.", "Yea well if we were all so blessed to just fork out all the money just because\u2026\ud83d\ude44 but some of us have to compromise space just for the experience and that\u2019s perfectly ok.", "The sleeping arrangements aren\u2019t the entire vacation", "Everyone needs a bed. It really doesn\u2019t matter which beds are in which rooms.", "Oh but OP is no good at planning/budgeting! Which is somehow different/better than their other kids not being good at it either! Must punish the children for not being good at something their parents never bothered to help them learn! Must play favourites based on whichever one of our kids' skill sets is convenient at any given time!!\n\nOP YTA.", "Not necessarily - for the sibs, 3 in a room vs 4 isn\u2019t that much of a difference, especially with extra amenities and places to spend time", "The people who are doing the only compromising on space seem to disagree.\n\nPerhaps they should take one or two less vacations a year so they can afford proper accommodations, instead of trying to shoestring vacations even though it's clearly not working well for half the family.", "And yet they are a big enough reason for you to veto some of the other suggestions. Strange how that works.", "As long as I had a proper place to sleep I would never have cared about what room I got on a family vacation as a teen.\n\nHell I've stayed on a pull out couch in the living room and it didn't matter, cuz guess what? The day is full of activities and the bed is only for sleeping.", "If it didn't matter then it wouldn't matter to Adriana either. But it does. She booked an accommodation that assured her ability to have an entire suite for herself while leaving her siblings to share one room and one bathroom. \n\nIf it didn't matter, you and your husband would have shared a twin in the multi-use room and given the king room on rotating nights to the other three kids.", "Clearly it does matter if Ariana is picking locations where she\u2019s the only sibling who gets her own space", "Unless it\u2019s your favourite child, then it matters", "Whoever finds the accommodation should pick last, to incentivize fairness. Getting your site chosen is enough reward on its own.", "Cool, so you can share a bunk with the kids.", "Im just making the point that possibly less room and let\u2019s be honest, probably not something the girls want to do as much, maybe isn\u2019t as good, but hey im not them or the kids! All in all, im saying that i dont think they are biased in picking the girls choice anymore than she is just good at knowing what the parameters are, which, being that they are paying for it, do get the final say.", "Like I said, they\u2019d probably have a say if they put in the effort like their sister.", "And I know as a kid I would\u2019ve hated having less vacations for the sake of bigger or more luxurious places. The experience is so much more valuable.", "Having your own bed as a kid is waaaaaay more important than having your own room.", "I don\u2019t disagree that they get final say. I think they\u2019re disingenuous to say that A\u2019s choices work best for the family when actually they work best for OP/spouse/A and when they incentivize A to find unequal options knowing she will always have first choice. A more fair system would reward the itinerary that was most palatable to everyone, not the one most preferred by the few."]}
