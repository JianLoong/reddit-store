{"id": 31460, "submission_id": "180yoc8", "title": "AITA for always letting my middle daughter choose her room/bed first on vacations?", "selftext": " My husband and I have 4 kids, Evan (20), Adriana (16), Elizabeth (15), and Michael (15). We try to travel 3-4 times a year. \n\n3 years ago, the night before we were supposed to leave, my friend told us we couldn\u2019t use her cabin anymore. We were all looking for new places and Adriana sent a listing for this small town in the middle of nowhere. We ignored it the first few times she sent it but she eventually talked us into looking at it and it was perfect. We paid a little over $200 a night for a beautiful cabin on the lake with a game room and enough beds to allow everyone to get their own bed. The people were great, the drive wasn\u2019t bad, and there was actually a lot of things to do there. It\u2019s become one of our favorite vacation spots. \n\nWhen Adriana was 14, we pretty much started letting her book family vacations. She had to run everything by us first but she was the one that chose where we went and where we stayed. Her only condition is that she gets first pick for rooms/beds. She\u2019s even booked an international vacation for us, including flights and a rental car. \n\nWe\u2019ve given the other kids opportunities to help with vacations. They all know if they can find a place that we\u2019d want to go to and stay within a budget, they can get first dibs if we book it. The problems are that they have a hard time sticking to a budget or they're set on a specific place even if it's not suitable for everyone. They\u2019ll pick a hotel or rental that\u2019s nearly the entire (or over the) vacation budget or doesn\u2019t have enough rooms because it has a specific feature. Because of this, we almost always go with Adriana's choice. We recently spent 3 nights in a cabin with 3 bedrooms. 2 rooms had a king bed and an en suite. 3rd had 4 twin beds. Adriana chose one of the rooms with the king beds. There was a pull out couch available but none of them wanted it. \n\nAfter we left, they were upset that Adriana got her own room and bathroom while the rest of them had to share. I told them they know the deal and that if they can find a place for everyone, stay within budget, and pick a place that we\u2019d all want to go to, they can also choose their room and bed. They say they try but we always pick Adriana\u2019s listings. I told them her listings are usually more practical. We paid a little under $600 for the cabin that we stayed at after taxes and fees. It had so many free activities nearby that the entire 3 day vacation for 6 people came out to just under $1000. They can\u2019t beat it with a $1800 listing with 2 beds and a single bathroom. \n\nThey think we\u2019re being unfair and should rotate who books the vacations and chooses the rooms but I just don\u2019t have that kind of money to throw away and I\u2019m not going to deal with the fighting that\u2019ll inevitably come when they pick a place with not enough beds or bathrooms.", "created_utc": 1700620511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180yoc8/aita_for_always_letting_my_middle_daughter_choose/", "score": 6454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She found a place that comfortably accommodated 50 percent of the people and because you, your husband and your daughter made up that 50 percent you are all happy with it. Three of you got the king beds with the en ensuites and the other three had to share a room and and presumably the general bathroom. That is crap. I wouldn\u2019t book that for my friends and not expect them to resent me. Why are you surprised that your other three kids are resentful. \n\nYou are the parents. Your kids are getting old enough that pretty soon they are going to be able to opt out of family vacations. You seem to be going merrily along w this system of yours making your own happy memories.

Adrianna is just a pawn in this cause she likes this stuff but unfortunately is causing her relationship with life her siblings to go South. As long as it cheap, OP will take it and it\u2019s likely that even if the rest came with a location just $100 more, she would take the cheaper option.", "AITA? I don\u2019t care what anyone says I\u2019m not TA! Why ask the question when you\u2019ve decided you aren\u2019t TA and just keep maintaining your position regardless of people\u2019s responses? This has already created resentment between your kids and this resentment will grow as the kids get older. I think you must be a troll because no decent parent cares so little about all but one child.", "YTA - The issue isn't that she gets to pick first, it's that you allowed her to occupy the room by herself. Her choice should have been that she could either share with someone in the room with four beds or she could share with someone in the room with the king size bed.\n\nA sole private room is not part of your agreement.", "YTA. You let her book a place with 2 rooms with king beds and one bunk room and then gave her the private room and bath? While the other 3 kids  (including 2 boys a girl) shared a room and bath? Bullshit. No wonder they are pissed. Plan your own vacations.", "YTA. And all of your arguing and right fighting in the comments proves it repeatedly.", "Yes YTA but judging by your self righteous and \"I'm right you're all wrong\" attitude I don't even understand why you're here? \n\nYou're not here for honest feedback because you get an attitude with everyone who criticizes you.. You believe you're 100% right, so why are you here? \n\nI personally think you're a jerk of a parent. Your husband too since it takes 2. I think you CLEARLY have a favourite. That favouritsm could be a result of your pure laziness but it's still there. \n\nI feel especially bad for your teenage daughter who's forced to share a bathroom/bedroom with 2 teenage boys while her sister is living lavishly in a room all to herself. \n\nEvery day I come on Reddit and I'm reminded that my mother really wasn't that bad. There's always a mother like you who is a total asshole. But hey! On the bright side as soon as they're old enough the 3 ignored/unfavoured children will definitely stop coming on vacation with you guys and you and your favourite daughter can have a blast.  Be that she plans everything of course.\n\nBut I'm sure you'll be one of those \"I don't know what happened, I gave them everything.\" Parents. \n\nI see where Adriana gets her selfishness from. You sound like a teenager yourself. Why should she look out for her siblings too when her own selfish mother doesn't. \n\nApple and tree and all.", "I was on the fence until reading your replies/comments.\nYou don't care if it meets all the needs as long as they meet yours, which is why you're having such a young girl planning family vacations in the first place. You also repeatedly dismiss the needs of your other children, saying a bed and a roof is all they need.\nYTA. You're also the parent... Plan the vacations yourself.", "YTA. I mean you can\u2019t possibly think that this sort of arrangement is fair for any of the other kids. This is how animosity starts among siblings, when parents clearly show preferential treatment towards one child. If you really wanted to make it \u201cfair\u201d for everyone, you would have offered assistance to ALL your kids. This is basically just Adriana\u2019s vacation where you benefit from it and the siblings are just dragged along.", "YTA. Adriana is choosing places purposefully that ensure she has a single room and amenities and where her siblings will be uncomfortable. She chose somewhere that did not fit the needs of the family and you let her because she is \"better\" at booking vacations. \n\nAt the bare minimum, the two girls could have shared and the two boys. Putting a 15 year old young lady in with two young men so that the favorite can have her own king sized bed tells your other kids exactly where they stand.", "YTA. Don't travel 3-4 times a year if you don't have the money to make fair sleeping arrangements for your kids. Make it 2-3 and let your other kids have some say.", "YTA here. Your middle child is good at this stuff and instead of teaching your other two or even having her help out, the middle child finishes obviously every time and you go with it without considering fairness. \n\nShe\u2019s honestly being mean by forcing her two siblings to bunk while taking the big bed. And she knows it. \n\nHave a rotation on who gets to pick accommodation and don\u2019t let your middle child butt in on it. If it\u2019s unequal and the siblings don\u2019t agree on rooms then don\u2019t just favour the middle child; parent and help make it even. \n\nIf your other two struggle, help them. Don\u2019t go back on your teenage daughter and say \u2018well, you didn\u2019t do well so this is why we\u2019ll go with hers!\u2019", "You have set up a system to ensure one child  gets preferential treatment.  Not ok.", "Her siblings can't plan as well as she... but neither can you. \n\nIt sounds like you're causing resentment to build amongst the other kids. YOU like the deals she gets, YOU have the final say. Why don't you limit the \"dibs\" between your room and her room, and let the other kids first get equal and equitable rooms, since you think your daughter needs to be constantly rewarded? \n\nYour other kids are not going to want to go on trip with you soon. You are choosing to not go with their choices, you don't help them to be better at planning, you're just creating favoritism.  Also, if she's choosing places that have to be split awkwardly, maybe she doesn't really care about great planning if she never has to deal with any downsides to her booking. her siblings bear the brunt of any poor accommodations, since i'm sure you and your spouse get the second best room.", "YTA. If you genuinely believe this to be fair, then you should take the crappy room or pullout sometimes, since you\u2019re not doing the research either. \n\nIt\u2019s actually more fair if the person booking has no say over where they sleep, because then they\u2019re incentivized to find something that is as equitable as possible. How do you know she couldn\u2019t find an even nicer place in budget with one king suite and two bunk rooms? That\u2019s a very common set up. She was incentivized to disregard them knowing a second suite would benefit her when the time came to choose rooms.\n\nYour other kids just sound bad at math and/or research and/or strategy, which is unfortunate, but not a good reason to keep  giving them the short end of the stick. I\u2019m sure their future therapists will agree.", "YTA. Instead of this awful system, have each child plan one vacation per year. Instead of saying no to the other children immediately, TEACH THEM how to stay in budget and how to plan for the family.", "YTA but not for letting Adriana pick, but that she gets to pick and it\u2019s a guaranteed solo room. It should have still been 2 per room, she can pick which room. Otherwise maybe start planning as a family more or be more specific in your housing choices in the future. This only has to happen once to grow resentment, better not to feed it.", "YTA. It\u2019s quite clear who the golden child is.", "YTA. Why are you arguing with everyone who says that YTA? What\u2019s the point of making this post if you already have decided that NTA?", "YTA. Taking vacation suggestions is fine, but having one child have the winning choice and preferential treatment in bedrooms for every trip is a recipe for resentment. Why can\u2019t you as the adult assist the other kids in how to create realistic vacation plans? I\u2019ve seen this happen time and again when parents have blatant favourites, the golden child turns into an adult asshole.", "YTA.  You should not let any of your kids have this much power over planning family vacations, let alone allow one child to make the majority of the decisions.  \n\n\nLet them each make recommendations or suggestions, but having them actually *book* accommodations is ridiculous.", "Why did you bother posting this? You\u2019ve gotten a resounding YTA and all you are trying to do is justify yourself. YTA. Accept it and move on.", "YTA. You are a s*** parent. You blatantly favor Adriana and it\u2019s gross, I feel sorry for your other kids.", "YTA. Your daughter picks places that meet your minimum requirement and gives her what she wants. She does not consider her siblings. Having 3 children share 1 room and giving the 4th significantly better accommodation is not fair. \n\nShe did the work so she should be rewarded. She should not be rewarded at the cost of the other children. \n\nGood luck convincing your other 3 children to go on holiday with you as adults.", "Soft YTA - this is super unfair to your other children \u2026 you need to offer to pay Adriana a travel agent fee or some other incentive for the work she\u2019s doing.", "YTA and you don\u2019t seem to care much for your children other than Adrianna. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t see much of them in the foreseeable future. \n\nYou let a nice idea (help with planning, get first dibs) completely derail. Change the rules to ensure all kids will enjoy.", "YTA\n\nWhy not teach them how to plan vacations? Or\u2026 you can plan it as a family so everyone is able to sleep comfortably??? Your oldest has figured out how to plan her dream vacation every time by making sure it\u2019s at or below budget. Yeah your younger two are planning extravagant trips, and no you don\u2019t have to agree to those trips. But they should be able to enjoy the trips regardless of who plans them. This sounds less like she\u2019s good at planning and more like you\u2019re lazy.", "YTA- perhaps you could be the adult, book accomodation yourself and ensure your children get equal treatment\u2026", "YTA. It's your responsibility as the parents to make sure that your children are treated equally. It's not fair that Adriana gets the better rooms because you don't want to book your family vacations. Also, is there any chance that Adriana's choices are cheaper because she sticks her siblings with the shitty rooms?", "YTA\n\nIt's OK to get the kids involved with planning but you shouldn't let one decide on all the vacations and get the best room just because she's a better financial planner. You're just doing whatever she wants to do and never let the other kids have a choice on where to go.\n\nLet the other kids pick a destination and you help them find a rental that is within your budget of that is problem.\n\nAnd for now on Adriana deserves the smallest room every time.", "Im exhaustedjust reading that. \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd2e", "YTA. Its almost comical that your kids are directly calling out your favoritism to your face and you think going \"get good losers\" is actual parenting lol have fun continuing to favor the golden child at the expense of your other children's relationships because you are too lazy to book your own vacation and be the adult.", "YTA\n\n> When Adriana was 14, we pretty much started letting her book family vacations. She had to run everything by us first but she was the one that chose where we went and where we stayed. \n\nStop **letting her** choose places that don't provide **equal** accommodations for *all* her siblings.\n\n> We recently spent 3 nights in a cabin with 3 bedrooms. 2 rooms had a king bed and an en suite. 3rd had **4 twin beds.** \n\nYou *never* should have signed off on that in the first place.", "Why did u asked, if u don't accept that u're letting your daughter created sibbling rivalry? Honestly, start planning yourbown vacations without Adriana's input and lets see if she will like too share a small room and others?!?!", "I\u2019m confused, why is a condition of her getting to pick that she ALSO gets to pick her room. She\u2019s choosing where you go AND gets to pick the room she wants?", "YTA, my parents did basically this exact thing. 4 kids and my older sister *always* chose. I'm an adult and can be mature about it now but even still, when I think about it my reaction is still being fucking livid before I chill out.", "YTA \n\nI would tell the other two to just plan a few sleepovers and not go.\n\n A brother and sister at 15 should not be staying in the same room. \n\nThe eldest is your golden child. The bedroom situation is inappropriate and needs to be addressed over the price. If it is too much, go on fewer vacations like an adult and parent.", "YTA. I understand that Adriana picks out good vacations within budget but that shouldn\u2019t put the rest of your kids at that much of a disadvantage. Adriana getting a king size bed while the rest of them get twins, a pull out mattress and one bathroom for three is completely unfair. Yes she picked it out but that is such an extreme difference. If she got a double and everyone else got a twin and the girls shared a bathroom as did the boys perhaps the reception would be more NTA. That however is not the case. This is clear favoritism and shows that she is prioritizing herself and you guys are enabling it. Again, the difference in treatment is ridiculous. The girls should have shared the king and the bathroom whereas the boys got the other bathroom and twins. So much more fair and it still ensures she gets dibs.", "YTA. Enjoy the shit nursing home you get booked at.", "Wow. YTA, and so are all of your comments defending your actions and not seeing how unbelievably wrong you're being to the rest of your family. \n\nStop favoring her, you are actively destroying your relationships with your other children. Like, permanently. They will remember this and resent the FUCK out of it.", "YTA.  Way to cause division between your kids. You're treating one like the favored princess and giving the others the leftovers.  Enjoy having them shut you out of their lives, probably sooner than later.\n\nAdriana has you figured out to a tee and will continue to book places that favor her while giving her middle finger to her siblings.", "YTA Pretty clear who is the golden child here.", "Yta simple as that. Stop playing favoritism. Stop punishing the other kids and grow up. Based on your previous comments, you definitely are defensive. Why did you even post?  You take no accountability for your blatant favoritism that everyone on here is telling you about.", "YTA. This is just weird honestly. I\u2019ve never heard of a teen being able to choose the vacations for the whole family and getting first dibs. Idk but it just feel off. Is Adriana your favorite or something? She\u2019s obviously trying to make sure she always has the best accommodations but doesn\u2019t care about where her siblings end up.", "YTA. You really need to admit you don\u2019t want to do the work planning a trip. You are creating unnecessary hatred between the kids. They are punished 3-4 times a year because your golden child knows how to save a few bucks. Did you ever think to teach them how to book trips? Eventually they will refuse to go on the trips. Don\u2019t act surprised when they go LC.", "YTA. The kids all need to take turns sharing. Not everyone is good at travel planning, it\u2019s just cruel to punish them for that. Yes they \u201cwill survive\u201d a few nights sharing a room but the relationships within the family probably won\u2019t survive very long with the way you are parenting.", "YTA, the issue isn't that you let her pick first - she should be sharing accommodations like her siblings do", "YTA how can you not see she chooses which places have enough accommodations for you and your SO and herself.", "YTA. There's a fair way to manage accommodation in this situation, and you're clearly giving preferential treatment to one child. All you're going to do is create long term resentment and animosity between your kids and also towards you.\n\nAs for your points where you've said you're not paying double for the kids to be equal, it doesn't require you to pay double - it requires you to be fair... and BTW putting money before y9ur kids emotional well-being is equally gross.", "YTA \n\nIf you bothered being a parent, you wouldn\u2019t have any problems.

The next vacation, you need to leave Adriana out of it completely. One of the other kids needs to come up with a plan but you will look for a backup in case they can\u2019t find one that meets your needs. Give them many chances if they keep missing the mark. They need the chance to learn this without just getting shot down and going with Adriana\u2019s pick every time. If they can\u2019t find one my a certain time, then you go with your pick (and you need to leave Adriana out of the selection process completely) and then figure out rooms and beds from there.\n\nYTA but you could start making it better if you wanted to.\n\nI also saw someone suggest taking fewer vacations if that would increase the budget. That\u2019s a good idea. 2 bigger vacations rather than 3-4 smaller ones could help.", "YTA\n\nI just wouldn't go with you anymore. You're showing clear favoritism.", "YTA - perhaps you plan your own vacations for the family, assign rooms, and put the kids on equal footing.", "YTA\n\nIf your other kids aren't as good at the financial planning aspect teach them how to be. In your own words they always go beyond budget. That can be a huge issue for them when they get older and it's your responsibility as a parent to teach them proper financial management. \n\nWhat an incredible learning opportunity and bonding moment to share with your other children. Help them each individually plan a vacation and give them guidance and aid when it's needed.", "This is a joke right? Who lets a child plan and book a whole vacation? Act like the adults and plan your own vacation jfc.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: all of op\u2019s replies just solidify more that they\u2019re a lazy parent who clearly favorites one kid over the others.

Clearly Adrianna isn't picking rentals that are big enough.\n\nI get vacations are expensive, but that comes with the territory of having to rent a place that can house 6, uncomfortably at that. The only ones to blame for that is you.\n\nMaybe start rejecting some of Adrianas picks if they are uncomfortable for your other kids.\n\nTravel less to afford better options.", "YTA.\n\nI grew up with abusive parents who would constantly try to pit me and myself against each other so that we don\u2019t have anyone to rely on. As we got older, we learned their tactics and realized the years of bonding and good friendship we could\u2019ve had if our parents didn\u2019t do all that drama. You might think this arrangement is benefiting your vacations but it is at the expensive of your childrens\u2019 bond. They will come to resent your middle daughter and create tension in the family that could easily be avoided if you let them all with together. For example, your daughter can be in charge of the overall planning but the siblings can help creating a list of potential options, creating the presentation, and ticking off requirements.", "NTA the other kids shouldn't be entitled.

You're rewarding her for doing what should be your job, obviously that's going to cause confict with your kids.", "YTA.

You should have checked the places accommodated all your family. You\u2019re the adult.", "You should've made your daughters share. Why do 3 people have to share a room when one of your kids gets a whole room and a king sized bed? You're ruining your kids relationship with each other as well as alienating the 3 others from you.

Otherwise, shocker here, you get accused of favoritism.", "YTA absolutely. There's not long until Adriana screws you and your other kids over for her own benefit. She is a selfish narcissist as it is. If she wasn't, she would pick hotel arrangements that would accommodate everyone in the family equally. And her selfishness is getting enabled by her parent. Wtf! Get ready for your other kids to absolutely resent you.", "You're making the others resent you and Adriana by making them feel like they're treated unfairly. If money is an issue, reduce the number of vacations. If Adriana can find affordable places for the vacation and you're not, it means you weren't looking hard enough. If her looking for places works for you, find other ways to reward her for the work of finding them. On the surface, it seems fair because a deal is a deal, but it's not fair to the others for her to have the big room with a kingsize bed while the other 3 have to share a room or one of them to sleep on the couch. That's why I think YTA. Act like a family and not like an auction where the lowest bidder wins.", "NTA. This is smart and fair.

It's fine that she gets dibs on choosing room/bed. It is NOT fine that in that specific situation she got the WHOLE room and bathroom to herself while three of her siblings had to share. It is too much. \n\nIt would be more fair if at least her other sister were sharing with her.\n\nAlso you really sound like AH in replies. A lot of people agree that you are AH. Admit it or shut it.", "NTA they all get a chance to find budget places and   no one slept on the floor. Yea it could have been two and two but did anyone else give viable options no. Is anyone else contributing than no. It's not easy paying for 4 kids and 2 adults and there were options. It's not favoritism since you favor being economic and as long as everyone has fun who cares. I didn't always have a bed growing up so they're being stupid.", "YTA if only because your lazimess is causing resentment among your kids. Make the reservations yourself or eliminate the '1st choice of rooms' perk.", "The thing you're forgetting is that this sort of inequality carries on into adult life. And not just who gets what beds. The trust, the preferences, the attitudes. They carry on.\n\nThis is the sort of thing that leads to siblings going no contact. and for life long resentment.\n\nYou're setting up a lifelong scenario here where Adriana comes first.

Even if she picks the place you need to rotate which kid gets first pick of the room", "ESH. Let\u2019s start with the 3 kids getting the short end of the stick. The reason they are AHs is that they were given (doubt it\u2019s \u201care given\u201d simply because it sounds like parents have made up their minds about letting the 3 kids try after the first \u201cfailed\u201d attempt however many years ago) parameters and failed to maintain them. My question is did you, as the parents, sit down with them and work through the reasons WHY their attempt was unacceptable and how to fix it so that the kids would have better luck the next time. I add a caveat regarding the oldest that he likely is only traveling with the family to give the twins someone that they can actually stand to be around at this point. Once the twins no longer travel with you (certainly after they turn 18 and can\u2019t be forced to go), he will probably drop the trips faster than a boiling hot rock. Otherwise he probably would have ditched the vacations due to the now blatant favoritism. Now to the final child. She KNOWS that by giving you the cheapest option that \u201cticks all the boxes\u201d she can manage to swing a better or best room as the prize even though it isn\u2019t a NEED (since you were emphasizing needs versus wants). This makes her an AH because she plans with absolutely no regard for the comfort of her siblings (she clearly knows that no matter what parents are going to get a/the good room). This were to include if one of the other\u2019s manages to do the same. Hers will be automatically accepted because she manages to find a cheaper option that has the things that YOU (and likely she) want to do with no care for what your other kids prefer to do. Guess what, she doesn\u2019t NEED a king size bed with an en-suite. She WANTS a king size bed with an en-suite. If you are going to emphasize needs and wants, they need to apply to EVERYONE. Now for you and your husband. Clearly you WANT to take 3-4 trips per year, otherwise if the trip were to go over budget then you would simply take from the budget of one of the other trips and reduce the number of trips per year. You\u2019re also not hurting too much for money if you can afford that many trips. Most people can barely afford 1 or 2 per year that\u2019s within reasonable driving distance. You threw your other 3 kids into the deep end and let them flounder. I don\u2019t see anything  indicating you sat down with them and worked through WHY their choice wasn\u2019t acceptable. Did you even tell them what the budget was and that it was a HARD budget? Or did you tell them \u201ckeep it to around x-amount\u201d? Did you tell them \u201cwe need at least xyz for accommodation and abc for entertainment, but after that it\u2019s free game\u201d? Or was it simply \u201csomething in x area\u201d? Did it ever occur to you that the trip your youngest daughter tried to plan may have been because a friend of hers talked about the trip their own family did (likely with far fewer people) sounded absolutely awesome to your daughter and she wanted to experience it without realizing that with 6 people the cost was far different? It sounds to me like you and your husband are too lazy to make the effort to plan a fair trip for everyone to experience and have dropped it on your middle daughter as well as failing to teach your other children how to do these things as well. If your oldest even knows enough to survive as an adult on his own, I\u2019d be shocked because it sounds like you don\u2019t care to put in the effort to teach your children good life skills like how to survive in the adult world. In short, you and your husband are the biggest AHs of the bunch.", "Going against the grain here - NAH. \n\nAnd a solid way to prove it's not favoritism is a blind submission.

As OP said the siblings found a hotel for $1800 with two bedrooms and one bath, which is most of the budget without food, this is unreasonable.  Adriana is the smart one she has figured out how to maximize the budget with lots of activities nearby.  Sometimes there\u2019s 3 -4 bedrooms with 2 baths.  It\u2019s a vacation you end up with a set #of beds within the room when booking a cabin or condo.  If they were to choose a vacation planned by the other kids there wasn\u2019t enough beds/baths for 6 people but had the features that they wanted.  It\u2019s a luxury to go on vacation every year.

Why would teenage girls want to share with their brother, unless it was agreed on all sides??\n\nI\u2019d personally state next time that no matter who finds the vacation property, that the boys get first choice of room and then it rotates every new vacation. You have four kids; it doesn\u2019t matter WHO finds the property under budget, you HAVE to be fair.

Simple as that. If the kids (out on their own) were booking a vacation based on the budget they had available but constantly went over budget, they wouldn\u2019t be going on vacation. This is a life skill, not a necessity. The only thing I would say do differently is spend time with the other kids building the skillset. And yes, OP could incentivize A to find the best rooms for everyone.. but not doing so is a far cry from BTA. It appears to be a free and carefree opportunity for the children.

You may suggest a point system. For example 4 points for the cheapest accommodation, 3, 2 for consecutive and 1 for the most expensive. Then points for how many people need to stay in the same room (if one room will be accommodated by 3 people - 1 point, if everyone has its own - 4 points, and something in the middle for middle options). Then similarly points for attractions around, price of the flights (if a place is not set in stone) etc. That way you've got a clear point system and who's place got the most points, that child wins.  \n\n\nBut I must admit these are some 1st world problems.

They just are looking at \"what's fair\" as a third party.\n\nThey don't consider the huge amount of work that goes into this because they don't really consider that work.\n\nHonestly the fact that they have budgets and take 4 a year is already a bit strange to me.  But I'd almost bet the others can't stay on budget because they're trying to be fair (everyone gets their own room) instead of sticking Adriana in a small room to share.  Also I bet proximity to fun things is playing a huge part in that cost too.  Seems like taking one or two less vacations a year would solve this problem and give them a larger budget to work with.", "The problem here is not the sharing, but the fact that Adriana seems to be unfairly benefitted from the whole arrangement regarding the siblings. That is the point. All normal people have to share, and the normal sequence would have been for Adriana to share her room, not for the others to share just one. If you say that this is the payment for her work, Adriana is never going to spend more time in a better arrangement for her siblings, because she knows she is going to be perfectly fine and they are going to do whatever she wants. And the arrangement is never altered because OP, as the parent, doesn't want to do the work and want to save money, and neither thing will happen if Adriana doesn't get the best room or this arrangement gets altered. The problem is not sharing, is that the arrangement only benefits one person and the others can't make their voices known (OP says the other children had presented proposals and they say OP always choses Adriana's).", "But at the moment this arrangement turned into Adriana looking for places with 2 nice rooms and some extra beds for her siblings. She knows HER room will be nice. It sounds a bit as if the siblings are also paying with their less comfortable rooms so Adriana can stay within budget.", "I did not miss that point. Let\u2019s stop pretending like Adriana is forced into this position. She probably likes looking for places. Is it hard work? Yes. I\u2019m not saying she doesn\u2019t deserve the room. I am saying that perhaps there\u2019s a better way to compromise on this as a family. I don\u2019t think OP is really being unfair, but I also see how it looks like there\u2019s a preference when the other kids watch her reap the benefits of this one thing year after year. \n\nFamily is an interesting thing and we aren\u2019t given all of the info here. Adriana is very good at internet searches. Maybe Seth is really reliable about helping out with his younger siblings. Maybe another of them is awesome at sewing and patches up all the clothes. So because Adriana is the one that\u2019s good with google, that means that Seth and the Seamstress Sibling should sleep in a bunk bed? Not really. \n\nI book the vacations for my family. I like to think all of us play an integral role in our family. My sister has been a literal lifesaver anytime anything comes up with us medically, there\u2019s really not a way to get PAYMENT for that. Your attributes make you part of a family. Booking vacations is something she\u2019s really good at but I\u2019m not sure that the reward isn\u2019t in her favor big time when the other siblings may happen to have a knack for something that just so happens cannot be rewarded in the same manner.", "Definitely she should be compensated in someway for the planning effort. I just don\u2019t know that she should get to live like a queen for a week while the siblings are crammed into a room. Especially because I\u2019m willing to bet several of the siblings are remarkable in their own way and help the family out in other very important ways. If Seth drives everyone around for practices and games all year and then Adriana puts in a few hours work on a Sunday to find a vacation home, does that really mean Seth deserves less of a vacation?", "The others could be  trying to be fairer than Adriana is so it's harder to find places.", "you may be right. idk i've been planning trips for so long it comes second nature to me to plan something in a reasonable budget", "Or the boys need to learn to suck it up and take the hit on amenities to afford the vacation.  The other kids need an attitude adjustment if they think they can consistently fail to plan a good, cheap vacation that ticks all the boxes and still get the benefit of the nice bedroom.  They claim it's \"not fair\" but don't seem to be doing anything to earn it, just want the room \"because\".  Maybe watch the sister and pick up some skills instead of blaming her or the parents for not spending enough on them so they're happy", "Why aren't you holding the other kids accountable, hmmm?  They're old enough to understand sister is getting her way and why.  Instead of blaming the parents and sister for not reaching out to show them how to plan better, why aren't you expect the complainers to take the initiate to learn?  15 is old enough to use your words, the oldest at 20 certainly should know better.\n\nLetting her keep the room upgrade during the tutoring will also not solve the problem.  The problem is money means someone's gonna not get the nice room/bed.  Unless they have the winning plan, it will not be their room and someone is always not going to win since not everyone is gonna be good at vacation planning.  You will still have resentment at someone having to sleep in the kiddie room and never the master if they feel it's the reward for planning because it will never be their plan.  There will always be a perennial loser with that plan.  \n\nWhat the parents need to do it work on the other kids understanding that it's a freaking free vacation and they are just sleeping there temporarily.   Life isn't fair.  Get over this irrational jealousy and enjoy the vacation.  Help them understand they have it good and that once they're adults, they're not going to be able to do this on their own.  Stop wasting time being bitter over something as petty as a twin bed and enjoy the vacations while they can; once they get out into the working world, this whole thing will cease to be an issue as they won't have the time or money to go.", "This is the answer! I kept scrolling for this. \n\nAll she had to do to make this fair was pick a sibling (her sister closest in age maybe?) to share the king-sized room! Her parents should've also enforced this.

If it's causing too much drama in your family you could choose a different perk for the planner.

If you have the # of beds, and the amount that you need to stay under, there isn\u2019t much information left. Planning isn\u2019t that complex. You just need to plug that info into a search engine and review the results. Rinse and repeat until you find something you like.", "Yea it\u2019s totally very Reddit. \n\nThe YTA commenters are the lazy siblings that feel like everything was so unfair to them. All while not wanting to do the work. \n\nNews flash. Those who do the work and provide others with what they want get ahead. They get the jobs. They get the projects. They get the raises. They get the gd room lol.", "And you think they won\u2019t put their kids in consideration whenever they approve it?", "Yeah. My family is quite well-off and we're all adults now and the last vacation we did as a family unit involved all 4 of us crammed in a hotel room with 2 king beds, me and my brother in one and my parents in the other. I have literally never done a family vacation that didn't involve me either sleeping in the same bed as my sibling or at least in the same room.", "Definitely sibling fairness is a weird ax that Reddit has to grind, which in many cases comes from a clear position of privilege.", "i know it's not, but you can't really expect a 15 year old to be simply told \"everyone gets a bed, look for places at a lake, this is your budget for activities, this is your budget for accommodations\" verbally and expect them to follow everything. teenagers are disorganized and at that age i know for sure my attitude would be something akin to \"but it's only an extra three hundred...\" \n\nwe're talking about an impartial way to choose vacations, to me having a physical checklist would eliminate the 'i forgot' argument and adds to complete impartiality and supports any refusal since they had a syllabus, know what i mean?", "But would it be no vacation? They go on 3-4, going down to 1-2 and the rest are staycations seems totally feasible and the kids might like some staycations anyways?", "Yup. And people are saying it's not that hard but as someone who has done trip planning with full grown adults who manage their own finances, it is shockingly difficult to get people to agree and to stick to a budget, timeline, etc.. And when people don't do the planning but are still going on the trip, you can be sure that they will still shout their opinions loudly and believe they should hold equal weight but they won't really put any effort into providing solutions or helping with the planning.", "Every skill is learned. Weighing the different parts of a vacation within the budget is a legitimate skill to be learned. It should be within their abilities. Personally, I would assign the next vacation to any kid that wants to plan for the perk and work with them to find something reasonable. Teachable moment. But as long as sis is doing the work, this perk seems 100% justified.", "Why are you presuming that at home the two boys and two girls have their own rooms? More than likely they share, or only the oldest sibling has their own room. So, sharing a room with siblings would not be a new thing. Also, according to OP her other children are offering 2 bedroom accommodations only and are expecting the parents to sign off on that. NTA, OP.", "The kids aren\u2019t 7, they are 15 and 20. Their priorities are skewed. They have tried, they know the rules but ignore them. OP never said that they weren\u2019t allowed to try, just that the one who finds the place gets first bedroom pick. They need to try harder if they are serious about wanting to get their pick chosen.", "Yep YTA. Your 14yo daughter has learned that if she manages to find a place that is under budget and has enough space for the entire family to sleep that she can get her own room whilst screwing over her siblings. It also sounds like your other children are trying but your budget might be unreasonable. You should absolutely not be approving vacations where your daughter has booked herself a room with a king bed and the rest of the siblings are sleeping together in twins. That isn't fair and you shouldn't keep allowing it to happen. You are majorly the AH and favoring one of your children so you don't have to plan vacations.", "YTA. This plays out super well as adults let me tell you. My BIL plans family trips and activities without us and specifically never accommodate our needs because he doesn\u2019t consider them often leaving us out. You don\u2019t want the trend in adulthood to be that your daughter plans all trips and your other children who may have families of their own just have to love it or leave it. That\u2019s not fair to everyone especially if they help pay at all.", "YTA.  Are you trying to get your kids to hate family vacations?  Either book equal accommodations for all the kids or split fairly based on needs.  FYI you clearly favor Adriana and it's going to push your other kids away.\n\n\"they were upset that Adriana got her own room and bathroom while the rest of them had to share\"\n\nTell me Adriana is the golden child without saying she's the golden child.  And don't try to hide it under the guise of saving money.  That fools no one.", "So not only are you letting her pick the place, she gets first dibs on bedroom.\n\nLet me guess the places the other kids pick have enough rooms for everyone, which is why they are out of your budget.  Since Adriana picks a cheaper place, you go there.\n\nWhat a joke. Pick a place yourself.", "YTA, because it's your job as a parent to teach the other kids how to pick an appropriate vacation spot. It sounds like you're letting them figure it all out on their own, and one of them happens to be naturally better at it. Your job as the parent is to help those who are not naturally good catch up.", "I think it is super weird that they didn't at least have her share the room with the king bed and en suite with one of her siblings. A king bed is big enough for her to share with a sister and then two of them get the benefit of the nicer room and bathroom, at least. Really though, the whole situation is bizarre. Who lets a 14 year old book an entire family vacation? YTA", ">When Adriana was 14, we pretty much started letting her book family vacations. She had to run everything by us first but she was the one that chose where we went and where we stayed. \n\nI'm sorry but what?????\n>She\u2019s even booked an international vacation for us, including flights and a rental car.\n\nA 14 year old?\n\nI do not believe this story.", "YTA. Honestly less of an asshole and more of a vicious idiot.\n\nYou\u2019re literally telling your other kids who your favorite is. The fact that you\u2019re calling a place suitable when one kid got a solo room with a king bed and an en suite and two boys and a girl all had to share one room and bathroom is evidence enough.\n\nRotating who picks vacations *would* be the fair thing to do. You already said you have veto power, you can steer them a little to make sure you\u2019re in budget. Maybe try being\u2026adults? Parents?", "I was the baby sister who had to share a bed or sleep on the floor while my 4 brothers and parents had beds. Lovely.", "My answer was going to be different until I read your comments. YTA. Sounds like you should be putting some of that holiday budget towards family therapy while you still can.", "You're a dumpster fire of a parent! YTA in case you couldn't guess but you'll survive, right - just like the kids you disregard.", "It\u2019s a great way to make other kids feel resentful too for no good reason! Like siblings get resentful sometimes but don\u2019t purposely create situations for this to occur! Foster some kind of fairness!", "> Are you trying to get your kids to hate family vacations?\n\nYou'd have to be pretty spoiled to have four vacations a year. Some children don't even get four in their entire childhood.", "I am blown away by the accusations of abuse and favoritism. These people are going on vacation and it seems totally normal, especially for the kinds of trips young people tend to go on - school trips or college friends typically bunk together in a few rooms and it's even worse at some youth hostels since you don't know everyone! \n\nI am the vacation planner in our family and it is hard work to do all the planning. If one of my family took that away from me and did a great job of it, I'd gladly let them take the good room. Besides, the 20 year old could stay home presumably if these trips were so unpleasant.", "Yeah as 1 of 4 (and the youngest) accommodations aren\u2019t always gonna be equal, especially with a budget. The girl found a skill she\u2019s good at and is significantly contributing to the labor that goes into planning and executing a family trip. She\u2019s not contributing $ but she\u2019s contributing a lot of time and effort and a skillset none of the other kids have. Idk what the big deal is, this would not have bothered me in my family. If OP wants to insist on equal accommodations for her 4 kids they\u2019ll have to cut back somewhere else, but I\u2019m sure the daughter can handle that. In that case though, I\u2019d honestly pay my kid or do something else nice for her for the effort of planning the trip but tell her to keep it to herself bc her other siblings sound petty", "Why are you trying to make it weird, trying to play out some twisted fetish? Get help dude.", "I like Hunger Games as a metaphor for a lot of things in life lol. The idea that the folks on the lowest rung have to fight each other for meager resources, rather than that everyone gets what they need.", "Four twin beds in one room. Meaning one kid got their own room and a king while the other three had to share a room.", " Good question! I mean, 20, 16, 15--that should certainly be an option.", "Yeah, we have a lot of participation trophy winners commenting here. A puts the work in. A lot of work. She should be compensated at the very least with a bed at the place she plans. If the other siblings really wanted that first pick, they would work for it. Possibly, I dunno, look back on the many successful trips A has planned, and figure out what she's doing right. I work with kids, and problem solving/basic functioning skills are becoming nonexistent. Incentives for any kid that takes an interest in something that requires sustained mental effort for more than 30 seconds is the only way to make useful human beings. \n\nFor those saying favoritism, give me a break. If they work for a company and they're given parameters to meet and they all show up, only one of them actually meeting those parameters, who do you think is getting a raise? Who are they letting go? These parents are nailing it. Life doesn't care if you tried. Working at something until you make sense of it is what matters. Making kids learn that lesson as adults is a huge disservice.\n\nSaying the parents are lazy is also silly. They obviously put the effort into raising at least one self-reliant kid. That doesn't happen by letting Tik Tok do the parenting. IF anything, my one critique would be to suggest the kids work together on it. If A has the secret sauce, she can learn the value of leadership. The way it is set up now is very competitive, and unless the competition is what drives this kid, they can likely find ways to make more people happy.", ">It has what it has,\n\nAnd what is has allows to perfectly accomodate 2 people per room.", "Maybe the others refuse to cram anyone in tiny shared rooms, so Adriana always wins the budget war, because she sure as hell will.", "OP \u201cdoesn\u2019t have money to throw away\u201d on stupid things, yes.  Seriously, having your own room on a short vacay is an extreme luxury.  Everyone so focused on blaming the girl they miss that the younger boys are demanding to incur a pointless cost just because they're spoiled.  How many families can even imagine booking something more expensive for such a jealousy-based reason?  So you share a room, so what?  You think the teen boy wants to share a room with his teen sister if the second 15yr manages to score the single bedroom???  People REALLY have thought this through and are latching onto something to make her the villain when it's the others that seems to be whining they're not being pampered enough!", "Yeah she needs to be accounting for the fact that her siblings are also mixed gender and a 15 year old girl probably doesn't want to share with her 15 and 20 year old brothers in a room- and vice versa.   \n\n\nI think the parents need to set more expectations on location or \"sure you can pick the room but if there are two \"kids rooms\" she needs to share with her sister, choose wisely. She'd still get to pick but she'd have to think through more things.   \nAND OP doesn't say anything about what others have going on. It might be that the 14 year old has less homework, doesn't do sports or AP classes etc. etc. The others might not have time to comb through page after page of listings.", "I don\u2019t think it is appropriate that 1 girl gets the king sized bed and en-suite bathroom while her sister shares a bedroom and bathroom with her brothers?  That is ridiculous.  It sounds like Adrianna only has to find accommodations that suit her and her parents, not the whole family.  Very selfish of you both.", "I\u2019m pretty sure four beds means it can accommodate four people. Have you been on many vacations? I\u2019ve definitely always had to share rooms, from hotels to cabins.", "Well favoritism sucks even when the people getting the short end of the stick are objectively getting enough.", "Yeah, everyone wants to do a trip and share their opinions but people hate doing the work. Hell, I love to plan and do a lot of planning for my solo trips; I'd be happy to do it for group trips but the issue is everyone will come in, see the plan, not care or just give random opinions without proper follow up off the assumption I'll go figure it out.", ">I\u2019m pretty sure four beds means it can accommodate four people\n\nExcept there are 6 beds and a pull out couch, not  4 beds. \n\n>Have you been on many vacations?\n\nYes, plenty, 1-3x a year since I was like 3, excluding the pandemic and when I swiched jobs. But you do not need to go on vacations to understand different bed sizes can accomodate more than 1 person. And a King bed can absolutely accomodate 2 people.", "3 bedrooms should work, but you'd think one queen/king room, and then two other rooms that can fit at least 2. Did the youngest sister get to pick between sharing the king with her older sister or was she forced to share a room with her brothers?", "Yeah, but that's why you should teach the other kids how to plan things properly if they don't know how, not just go \"well, sucks to be you.\"", "Right, one kid has an important life skill and the others don't. When your kids don't have an important life skill you freaking teach them it, not say \"well sucks to be you, your sister is better at it then you, enjoy the shitty room.\""]}
