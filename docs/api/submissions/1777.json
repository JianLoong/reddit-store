It shouldn\u2019t be your job to babysit her. Obviously, you should be there to morally support her, but it seems like she is constantly expecting you to save her from work.", "NTA - as you said, you have work, and I'm sure you support her in her studies (sounds like it from your post), but you didn't choose to study - she did. Take it from me (someone who works full time and studies full time), your GF's time management issues are her own. If she wants to do well in her studies, she'll make the effort and plan her time better. You might have to get used to being ignored now and then while she concentrates on whatever assignment she needs to get done, or when she's revising for an exam, but doing the actual work is all on her.", "NTA.  Sad that girlfriend being responsible for her own life.  It's not your job to cover for her failures in judgement.", "NTA\n\nShe has to do the work herself or she doesn\u2019t learn.", "NTA\n\nHi, busy grad student in their mid twenties here. Helping her occasionally study is one thing, but to the extent that you're describing is inappropriate. I get not having a lot of time and stuff, but if she can't plan her schedule to accommodate for her schoolwork, that's on her.", "No NTA, unless she REALLY wants to start calling you daddy she needs to grow up.", "NTA. You can be a supportive partner but that doesn't mean doing the work for her at all. If this is a consistent pattern of behaviour (putting off Important Thing until a deadline,) she may be on the ADHD spectrum and should seek resources to help manage/address it better if her current methods don't seem to be effective.", "NTA. It's not your education, it's hers.", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn't do the work, she shouldn't get the degree.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s a grown adult. As her SO you should support her, but you\u2019re not responsible for making sure she gets her schoolwork done.", "NTA but I bet that's so hard to sit in. I hope she gets support and learns some strategies to manage time/anxiety etc.", "NTA\n\nIt's one thing to help her study, it's quite another to enable her irresponsibility. I had a friend that did that for her bf. I told her numerous times she shouldn't be doing his school work for him as it was both immoral, unethical, and quite dangerous (he had picked a profession where if he didn't actually know what he was doing, people could get hurt). She didn't listen and soon after he passed the course, he dumped her.", "NTA, there's lots of ways you can be supportive... but not doing the literal work for her.\n\nI hope your being supportive in the other ways, but if she's procrastinating till the last minute that makes it harder for you to even be supportive.  Like doing some extra household work to give her more time to study, or time to decompress etc.  But then she'd actually have to be doing the work on some kind of scheduled basis.\n\nAs a fellow procrastinator I totally sympathize with her.  It's a terrible habit that is hard to break out of.  It can ruin a lot of ambitions in life.  But you can't fix that, you need her too.  (Or just get it more manageable realistically)", "INFO: when you help her study, is it a back and forth where she bounces things off you, or is she basically expecting you to provide a cliff's notes for her?\n\nIt very much seems NTA, and telling her \"waiting to tell me you needed study help until the last second wasnt helpful to.anyome\", and if you think your relationship is going to suffer drastically for saying \"it wasnt a good idea to wait until the last day to study\" then, to be frank, I'd be worried about the actual stability of the relationship, as that's a sign she only likes what you do for her as long as you enable her flaws.\n\nI would STRONGLY suggest, in a somewhat low-stress period of time, talking to her and asking \"what happened with the exam that you waited until last minute to tell me you needed help studying\"", "NTA as long as you leave her ass", "You are NTA. Since she is the one studying and attending college she alone is responsible in completing her assignments and studies with her own efforts and to her best. YWBTA if you help her to complete her assignments and she learns nothing from it", "Nta for not doing her work.\nYou do sound judgemental. (Under the belief you vocalize number 2 to her) you are inherently unsupportive. \n\nQuality time seems to be a underlying issue to. \nI must say\nPerfect way to hold firm n stong boundaries, great characteristics trait to have.

You might want to think about whether this is someone to plan a life with.", "I certainly hope y\u2019all aren\u2019t in medical school for her to ask you to do her homework! She isn\u2019t going to learn anything if she is dependent on you for all the work for her. It\u2019s a tall order that she\u2019s asking of you, and that\u2019s a hard pass. You are most certainly NTA. Sidebar, you may want to evaluate your relationship, because if that\u2019s the only reason why y\u2019all are together\u2026..Well, then that is not a great foundation as you deserve much more and you have a lot to give with your wonderful qualities. I can see you have compassion, and you wear your heart on your sleeve. I just hope people don\u2019t take your kindness as a weakness. Best regards to you OP.", "NTA\n\nThis is her degree to earn.  You doing her work doesn't help her learn the material at all.", "YTA - you're choosing being judgey over being supportive - it's perfectly normal to want study partners and she's asking for it to be you - if you don't help (and are rude to her about it and call it doing her homework) she'll spend all her out of class time with someone else who from her course who will help.\n\nThrow in that it's just before an exam and it's just really clear you're setting yourself up to lose her with this behaviour!", "INFO: are you part of the reason it's been left so late?\n\nI only ask as having been the student in a cohabiting relationship while holding down a job, partner would occasionally be all 'I'm bored let's do something' on nights I'd set aside to study. It's hard to say no all the time. \n\nThink back on whether she's potentially pushed any of her study time to do something you've asked.", "Exactly. If OP were to do the homework for her, she won\u2019t learn the material and understand it properly. Actions, or lack thereof have consequences.\n\nGF didn\u2019t wanna study until the night before exams, not even prepping for exams and then goes surprise pikachu at failing class. If she doesn\u2019t wanna fail, she should put in some effort.\n\nIf she gets a job later on, is she gonna call you to do the work for her? Take her workto home so you can do it while she lazes around?\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t mind being ignored, especially if it is for a good reason. Whenever I bring up time management or call her out on procrastinating I\u2019m made out to be TA. Honestly it is a huge point of contention in our relationship.", "I am definitely a tad judgmental when it comes to procrastination and putting off responsibilities. However I also believe that I am extremely supportive of her. I regularly tell her that I\u2019m proud of what she is doing, provide positive affirmations, compliment her work and just try to make life easier in general. I don\u2019t know - is it wrong to tell her that I think it was irresponsible to procrastinate?", "I guess what I\u2019m struggling with is when does being supportive turn into being taken advantage of? I am generally game to help her and usually do. For example, with papers, studying for exams etc. However I don\u2019t feel it is my responsibility to pull an all nighter when she could have started studying much earlier. But ultimately I\u2019m not sure, which is why I made the post.\n\nEdit: to clarify, when I say help with papers I mean proof-reading, brain storming ideas, etc. not the actual writing.", "She\u2019s not asking for support. She\u2019s asking for him to the actual work for her. If you loose a partner because you don\u2019t want to do their work for them, basically cheating, you\u2019re better off without them.", "In this particular situation I don\u2019t believe I contributed to it being left this late. Though I can understand how that could occur.", "Procrastinators have rights too.  Just wait until our rally next week.\n\nOh wait that was pushed back again.. but it's coming.", "My husband has to deal with this occasionally from me (the being ignored part) but he constantly asks if there\u2019s anything he can to around the house to help so that I can focus on study. If I do poorly on any assessment because I\u2019ve put off studying until the last minute, I fully expect him to tell me I shouldn\u2019t have left it so late, and I should learn from that mistake next time. And if I am studying and he has to get up early for work, he just says goodnight and goes to bed. I do my best not to wake him when I eventually head to bed myself. I would never ask him to summarise chapters the night before an exam though - that\u2019s totally my responsibility", "I wouldn't say it is wrong, but it wasn't terribly helpful. You adding that isn't really a \"reason\" to refuse to assist her, it's just a value judgement on her behaviour (and a negative one) so all it adds into the situation alongside you refusing you help her (which is warranted btw) is a sprinkle of \"and I think your behaviour is irresponsible too\" which is reasonably interpreted as an attack.\n\nI think so long as you support her in the ways you mention, that's supportive enough. When a partner is studying, they shouldn't expect their nonstudying partner to adjust their schedule at the last minute to help them because of their own lack of planning. If the \"study support time\" is set up in advance and agreed with by the nonstudying partner as they can work their schedule around it, that's fair enough. But none of this \"I expect you to drop whatever you're doing/planning to do and help me because I haven't managed my time properly; or you don't love me.\" bollocks.", "Forgive me if I over stepped. I am going off what stood out to me. That being said she sounds very lucky..  To answer your question: Not at all. delivery and timing can be just as important. Criticism can also be a tool for shaming and berating if said factors are off. If she was upset with what you said (I assume) it may be how you delivered it or when it was said.", "NTA you have to go to work in the morning & presumably need a good night\u2019s sleep. End of.", "Being taken advantage of? That would be her asking you to do the writing for her, not her asking for support.\n\nIt's not like you can't even be like \"I actually really need sleep or I'll have to miss work tomorrow/do bad at work so I gotta be in bed by X\" but my YTA judgement is cos of how you're framing her asking for help as her being lazy and entitled, and like, how your title is \"do her homework for her\" when actually you mean \"brainstorm with her and do proof reads\"", "She's asking for him to be study buddy, many people spend most of their time out of class with their study group, this is a way to keep them spending time together!", "Then NTA but perhaps recommend to her to set some regular time aside for her studies going forward - catch up with a friend to give her space etc.\n\nSounds like she needs better habits and that is something you can help with.", "In the specific example she is essentially asking me to do her work, summarizing chapters for exam prep. I wouldn\u2019t usually mind except she is asking the night of and I have other responsibilities. The language I used, \u201cbeing taken advantage of\u201d, was probably not proper given the situation. But I do feel that at times my desire to see her succeed (as well as others) leads to me doing a disproportionate amount of work.", "He\u2019s her partner not her study group. She didn\u2019t ask him for normal study group tasks. Study groups study together and support each other they don\u2019t let other people do their work for them. She\u2019s not asking him for support but to actually summarize her book so she doesn\u2019t need to read it\u2026 And she asks him to do so at night while he has a job. You seriously cannot compare that to having a study group.", "You\u2019re right. Summarizing chapters because she doesn\u2019t want to read them herself is a ridiculous ask. She might have study problems which need to be addressed but you doing her work for her is not the solution. You should not loose sleep because she failed, for whatever reason, to study until the very last moment."]}
