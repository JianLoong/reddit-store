I feel that if more parents took a harsher stance against bullying it would stop.", "I recently heard a speaker talk about natural consequences vs logical consequences.  The gist of his talk was that he first would allow the natural consequences to occur and if those failed to be teachable then he would add in logical consequences.\n\nHis example was what if his kids got caught shop lifting, the natural consequences would be the police being called, his kid hand cuffed taken to the station, etc.  He said he would let that play out until it was clear his kid had learned their lesson.  When at home he wouldn't add an additional punishment only reinforcing that the natural consequences were just.\n\nOnly if his kid continued shop lifting would he pile on his own punishments.\n\nSo with that out of the way, what were the natural consequences from the teacher and school?  Was it just calling you and asking you to handle it, was he suspended?  Did the teacher speak with your child, was he asked to apologize?  Write a note?  What was the fall out from his behavior with out you stepping in?\n\nThen does your child seem remorseful?

At 6, she can understand she was wrong, but she doesn\u2019t understand the deeper implications you are reacting to.\n\nAll of that being said, if the field trip is tomorrow, okay, I feel neutral about that. If it\u2019s in the future, it\u2019s certainly too harsh as punishments should be timely and in the moment.

Kids are often unintentionally brutal. Nothing in your posts mentions surrounding interactions or intent. That\u2019s not to say what she said or did was okay by any means, just that it could easily be in the \u201cshe still needs to learn some basic things and needs to do x to do so\u201d more than the \u201cshe needs to be severely punished.\u201d You make this sound like a one off offense in your comments, so I\u2019m not sure the latter is warranted yet. This is a time to make sure it doesn\u2019t become a repeat offense, and though your idea of punishment *could* do that, I could just as easily see it causing resentment without the intended lesson. \n\nPunishment doesn\u2019t always teach, and sometimes other things can be more effective for doing so at a first offense. She needs to understand what was wrong and why. I\u2019d emphasize how unkind it was, ask how she\u2019d feel if someone said something similar to her and make her reflect/talk about that, insist on an apology and doing something kind for the student, and opt for some lesser lost privilege or punishment. Make it clear that if she does similar again, repercussions will be more severe. Maybe even mention that you considered keeping her home from the field trip and are only holding back because of kindness and you know she is generally better than this  - and that will make it all the  more disappointing if she shows you that faith is misplaced. If she does anything similar again, bring the hammer down accordingly.\n\nSo, soft YWBTA.

Others have suggested loss of screen time, a stern discussion, or writing an apology note. I agree.

Subsequent pushes would have consequences laid out in advance; that way she knows both the expectation and the consequences for breaking it.", "To those suggesting my response on discipline is a reaction to me being embarrassed, I can assert this has nothing to do with how I feel.

So mild YTA. Natural consequences to hurting someone should be needing to right your wrong in some way and make the other person whole. I think you\u2019re on the right track here with making a big deal about this, but I would be more likely to try to approach the parents and see about organizing a get together where your child needs to apologize and make it up to the other child. Your goal is to teach your child empathy, not just start doling out punishments. \n\nWhen he was in 1st grade my son did something bullying to another young boy in his grade, and the school called us. We went the whole restorative Justice route and my son has grown into a very sweet, empathetic young man. You want to be a force for teaching your child these important skills.\n\nAnd let me be the one to point out that you are not parenting as a team here. If your wife had misgivings about the punishment and you continue to implement it without her consent, that\u2019s disrespectful of your wife. And your wife CAN veto you here. You only need one parent\u2019s signature on a school field trip form.", "I'm going with YTA on this one. From your comments it sounds like she might have picked this up from one of her older brothers' TV shows, and that this is a first time offence. That, combined with her age means she would learn better with a different punishment, and probably would not connect her punishment to the crime.\n\nInstead have her write an apology note. \n\n\"Dear _______,\n\nI'm sorry I was mean. \n\nI think you are [compliment], and [another compliment], and also [third compliment].\n\nSincerely,\n\nOP's child\"\n\nThis will help her see a direct link between bad behavior, consequences, and also helps her learn to take responsibility and to try to make things *right* again.\n\nIf that still doesn't feel like enough of a consequence you could also have her go to bed early so she can think about how she made that girl feel.\n\nSo while I admire your desire to act so she won't do this again, I do think she'll miss the lesson if you take away a field trip. \n\nFocus on helping her heal that relationship with kindness, and your daughter will learn a lot more. \u2764\ufe0f", "INFO.

Like, when she gets in trouble on daily basis, does she express remorse? Does it seem like she learns from her actions?

That will be the best lesson, versus an unrelated punishment.", "Did you have a talk with her about why she would say something like that? maybe the other girl was bullying her first.

At her age if you cancel her field trip she may just blame the other kid and make her life harder for ruining her field trip.

She needs to learn how to be around people who are different from her in a positive way. You need to teach her that.

Then ask her what she should do about it and help her do that thing. Ask her too what would be a fair way for you to handle it if it happens again and make some suggestions to help her pick. If she shows no remorse you and your wife will have to pick that apart too. By seven kids have a pretty strong sense of fairness, so while she will need your help guiding her through it, if she chooses her own consequences, it will be more effective. \n\nI am going to say YWBTA, but in the gentlest way possible.

If you think that it is more of a failure to communicate appropriately in a social environment, then I'm not sure that canceling the field trip is going to really help.\n\nRegardless, you need to do more than just cancel a field trip.

Was this one time occurrence or is there something going on with the one kid in particular? Does she often say nasty things to peers? That\u2019s what you should be trying to figure out here. If this is ongoing behavior, I still wouldn\u2019t take any school sponsored event away. If you feel like you must take something away for this then I would do no screen time (phones, iPads, computer, and tv) will have much more of an impact than taking an educational event away.

His comments are viewed as less deserving of punishment (although still deserving of a conversation) because he didn't use words that can be taken as offensive descriptors. It comes down to intent I guess, which can be tricky to ascertain because you weren't there. Have you had numerous conversations before this incident about calling people 'fat'? In the first grade I also had kids calling me 'four eyes' (I wore glasses) and other names. I view this differently as these insults are used for the purpose of putting people down (as opposed to saying something observational like \"you wear glasses\").

She was most likely just parroting something she heard verbatim - which I'm sure you know is SUPER normal at that age. We all said dumb shit at that age without really comprehending what it meant. It's unfortunate that the dumb shit she chose to repeat hurt another kid's feelings, but taking away a HUGE life experience won't fix the situation.

Instead it was treated almost like a detention. You basically had to stay in a mostly empty room with a teacher or other staff member \"babysitting\" you. So if OP's daughter's school has a similar policy, OP is basically forcing his daughter to work harder while the rest of the kids are having fun.\n\nAnd she needs to work harder, but the work should involve intervening with her behavior, and helping her understand why what she did was inappropriate and hurtful.", "It's not teaching her anything though.\n\nI say this as someone who had a LOT of behavioral challenges in school and a lot of punishments that weren't addressing the problem; they were just making me angrier and lashing out more.\n\nWhat really helped me change my ways was when my parents eased up on the punishments and let the school take what they felt was the appropriate action. If the school says she can't go on the field trip, I'd be more inclined to agree. But from what OP wrote, I'm not getting that impression. Seems like OP is doing this mainly because he's embarrassed.

You need to set these things in motion early on or she will going on thinking that talking to people like that is alright, when it most certainly isn't.", "Yeah. Your type of kids are in my neighborhood and sometimes come over and do shit they know they shouldnt do. And they do it because you have some weird idea of how they dont know whats appropriate. And then i have to tell them to stop doing things they know are wrong", "Agree.  Plus OP says in another reply that the field trip is next Friday.  The consequence should be much more closely tied to the action.  Like no electronics starting tomorrow through the weekend, and work on an apology note.", "Most field trips they go on at that age can be done with family at another time.  Missing a field trip isn't going to hold them back. NTA", "Agreed!", "Plus she had to have learned that behavior from somewhere. Maybe she was repeating something she didn't know the meaning of, maybe she was being intentionally mean. If it was intentional meanness, was it provoked? It's much different to say mean things to someone who say, steals your toy or pushes you, than to march up to someone and say it unprompted. She shouldn't be using insults about someone's physical appearance either way, but it does make a difference and leads to insight on what *type* of conversation needs to take place, either it's how to deal with a bully or not to bully others *and* an additional conversation about not making personal attacks like that even if someone did upset her. (Which of course also has exceptions but young kids aren't going to grasp that nuance yet.)\n\nPunishments have to be proportional to the crime. Taking away a social and developmental milestone is not proportional for a first time offense. If she had done this before and it was a habit, or there were concerns of her bullying or having inappropriate behavior on the field trip, I'd say to take it away. But it seems like it isn't the case, and erasing the nuance and not trying to figure out what caused is doing a disservice. If it was a response to her being bullied, OP is effectively saying \"I don't care if someone is mean to you, it's your fault because you responded.\" That's *also* a lesson OP needs to make sure to avoid teaching, and going scorched earth (OP said in another comment \"I'd rather go harsh and sear in this moment\"), even if she *is* solely in the wrong and said it unprompted, doesn't solve the root of the issue which is that the child doesn't know how to properly conduct herself socially and needs to be sat down and explained how", "When I was young, dumb, and willing to babysit, so about 11, the little girl I babysat asked me why I was fat and my house smelled funny. She wasn\u2019t trying to be mean, I was fat and the house did smell funny to her; it didn\u2019t smell like her house.", "I\u2019m trying to be as concise and to the point as possible on the replies. I\u2019m open to feedback on my proposed punishment hence opening myself up for scrutiny from every corner of the internet.", "I second it feels more like op is concerned about embarrassment than the kid\u2019s feelings abd it being a reachable moment.", "9. She\u2019s 6.", "I think you need to look at this as a teachable moment. The punishment just doesn\u2019t fit what she did, developmentally she isn\u2019t going to connect that. \nI think you need to talk to her (and or read books) about why we don\u2019t talk about other peoples body\u2019s and how that can make them feel. She\u2019s still learning what\u2019s socially acceptable. \nMaybe get her to make a card or do something nice for her classmate. \n\n( my 5yr old told his dr. her eyes looked weird last month.

There was a mediation of sorts, and the boy apologized and wrote me an apology note. He also had to carry my backpack for me at the end of the day, and carry my lunch tray during lunch for at least two weeks?\n\nTo be honest, I remember feeling bad for him by the end of it. I knew he was pissed off about me being on the frame when he wanted it. I knew that two weeks was a long ass time for us. We were 8. \n\nI never became friends with him, but I didn't fear him or hate him. Instead, we kept our distance but with a weird mutual respect for each other. \n\nHe was genuinely sorry. I genuinely forgave him.", "All I saw was that she said she didn't know why she said that. That's not the same as being malicious. You're assuming the worst in a fiest gradrer who for all you know could have a social learning disorder that hasn't been diagnosed yet. It's alarming that you're using a more mature phrase like \"body shaming\" to describe a young child's behavior. Not even to mention impulse control is not well-developed at this age and if she didn't know why she said it, it probably has more to do with that than simply being mean. She needs to learn not to point out physical traits because it might hurt someone's feelings / make them feel uncomfortable, not that she's a mean (AKS bad) person for making a mistake. Every kid does this at some point unless they are extremely shy or self-isolating. It's very unlikely stripping a potentially important social learning experience from her will improve her social skills. It would make more semse to send her on the field trip with a mission of apologizing and asking the girl whose feelings she hurt what she can do to make it up to her rather than, again, isolating her from her peers because her saying one inappropriate thing on impulse makes people feel so unsafe around her, like she's a monster.\n\nI was called fat and weird and stupid in elementary school and it sucks, but at 6/7 years old an apology followed by positive interactions means more than someone avoiding you. Then it's like, okay, so I must really be those \"bad\" things because now this person who insulted me can't even stand to be near me!", "Because I\u2019ve noticed that people who don\u2019t have children who give parenting advice often give harsh, inappropriate advice. Saying that the child needs to be punished to be a decent human being? That\u2019s crazy. It is developmentally normal for a six year old to say hurtful things to others because they don\u2019t have social filters yet, explaining that to them and talking about appropriate social behavior is what\u2019s needed, not punishment. When I see people saying that this six year old needs to be punished i either assume that they aren\u2019t parents or that they are bad ones. Children learn through parents modeling appropriate behavior, discussing expectations and enforcing boundaries. Punishing a six year old, who said something they probably heard on a cartoon (per OP in earlier comment) by not allowing them to go on an unrelated activity is the bullying imo. \nThis is the type of parenting where kids grow up and go no contact, because parents shame and punish them.", "Now this is real life. Again most of people don\u2019t know how to write a check or how to address an envelope.. I love that you believe.. but I\u2019m telling the truth r", "Kids definitely feel this and may remember it especially if it was unprovoked.

But that isn't an actual punishment. Sitting in class doing schoolwork while missing out on a field trip is a punishment that she won't forget, as long as it is paired with a discussion about why. I would give this exact same punishment but tell her that if she is mean she doesn't get to play with the other kids because they will have more fun without her there, and explain how she being mean and can be better in the future.", "No, that's the restorative justice part. And the idea would be a genuine apology following a conversation with parents about how words can be very hurtful (remember she is 6, and sometimes 6 year olds say mean things and later regret them). A regular punishment like no dessert/TV this week would be fine in addition.", "But kids *do* need to learn how to apologize, ask for forgiveness for their actions, and process how their actions affected the person they're apologizing to. I'm not a parent so I really don't know how you go about teaching this to a kid, you obviously cannot force them into remorse so if they don't feel that, an apology isn't sincere. But they do need to learn that after hurting somebody, an apology is in order. I don't know how that is meant to be balanced, though.", "So what would be your approach on this?", "Six is old enough to learn that your actions have consequences, and that bullying is not acceptable.

She will recover.", "intent doesn't matter here, it's the parent's job to teach them why it is wrong, and 6 is old enough to learn that rude words and insults hurt people's feelings. and that's why we have 6 year olds go to school with other kids their age - to learn social skills. part of that learning is consequences for actions and words.  if the kid was 4 I'd say a punishment wouldn't help as they are too young to make the connection between action and consequence, but developmentally 6 is old enough to understand consequences for actions.", "The other kid is also 6.
