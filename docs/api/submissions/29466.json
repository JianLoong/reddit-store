But he has a hard time keeping things from his sister. \n\nSo, his sister and her husband start asking us what we are looking for. I sheepishly give them a high-level. After discussing for roughly a half hour, my sister in law says, \u201cI have a great idea. Why don\u2019t we all go in on one together?\u201d Both of our husbands enthusiastically agree. I was not so enthusiastic.\n\nSome additional detz:\n\n- SIL and BIL weren\u2019t able to afford their current house on their own. They both received substantial financial assistance from parents on both sides.\n\n- SIL and BIL have filed for bankruptcy independently within the last 10 years.\n\n- SIL and BIL have no concept of saving. They spend their money at a ridiculous rate.\n\n- I\u2019m the only person with enough liquidable assets to put down a deposit on another house.\n\nI calmly just shrug and say, \u201cLarge investments with family can get messy. I\u2019d rather we just buy it alone. I already decided I\u2019m selling off some of my stock to fund this. We\u2019ll be okay. Thanks.\u201d\n\nMy SIL\u2019s face instantly falls and she replies, \u201cDo you think you\u2019re better than us? Just because you made some lucky investments? Your money is technically my brother\u2019s money. If you two can\u2019t agree y\u2019all have problems.\u201d I laughed and said, \u201cNo, I just think you\u2019re risky investment partners.\u201d\n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken since.

There's family drama right now and the joint investment didn't even happen. Imagine how much worse it would have been if you did go in on a property together.", "NTA - if just an initial \"no\" caused this much trouble, imagine how much bigger it would be when the shower starts leaking, the plumber is called, and they don't want to pay their share.

The follow-up, not so much . . .", "NTA and do NOT let your husband wear you down on this.   Her vitriol when you politely declined is ALL the reason to know you made the right call, aside from their sketchy financial history.", "NTA SIL is causing drama already. You were honest when pressed. If you are risking the most capital, you get to make the call on investment partners. Also, if your husband in anyway agrees that 'your money is his money' and is open to the idea of a partnership with people who are so clearly a bad investment choice, get a post nup or paperwork protecting your money.", "NTA.

In addition to all the pitfalls already being pointed out by other posters, they would have equal rights to the property as in they could decide to move in and not leave. You would eventually be able to solve it but the legal bills would be high. If I was you I would figure out a way to buy it on your own without your husband. You would likely need a postnup for that. Your husband will be a nightmare with letting his family use your property.", "NTA  your response to her comment totally inappropriate comment was perfect", "NTA. You have a husband problem.

Particularly family who has no financial savvy. Even more particularly with family who then denigrates you for refusing.

There of course are exceptions out there but this certainly wouldn\u2019t be one of them.", "NTAH you declined politely letting them know you were fortunate to have the resources to do this on your own which was your intention anyway.

Please protect yourself!", "Your money is TECHNICALLY her brother's money?\n\nSo what--hubby handed you his paycheck while you sat at home watching netflix and eating cakepops and you invested his money as yours?

No, Ops money is not \\*technically\\* anyone's money other than OP's. Married or not, you both have your OWN monies.

He enthusiastically agreed to get financially involved with a couple who have needed money to afford their lifestyle and filed for bankruptcy - solely because it's is his sis and BIL.\n2. You and he need to agree on parameters (e.g., no financial entanglements with sis/BIL), and he needs to be rock solid in his commitment to those parameters. This is a big deal because I could imagine him letting sis/BIL inveigle their way into your investment (or make use of your investment) behind your back.\n3. You and he need to agree on how you two respond to overtures from his sis/BIL - maybe he speaks because she's his sister; maybe you speak because you both know he will fold in two seconds. (In that case, he needs to work harder to keep his mouth closed about your financial dealings.)\n4. Maybe he is never going to stop sharing info/resources etc. with his sister and you may want to rethink how you two handle your finances.\n\nIt doesn't matter what SIL/BIL think or say; what matters is what your husband says or does.", "NTA and oh hell no!

Just no.... I'd put it on the back shelf for now until they stop asking. Just say that you changed your mind or found something else to invest in. Your husband is an idiot. First, for not keeping his big trap shut. 2nd for agreeing it is a good idea. He disrespected your partnership twice. Time to back out of this and put this on hold until you are sure about the partner you are married to.", "First, you are very wise unless your extended family is like minded. Which they aren\u2019t.

My husband and I manage our own accounts and assets. That will never change. Especially those earned before we started dating. \n\nI understand her confusion despite her shitty comment. I plan on talking to her in a couple weeks and explaining it objectively. Why we don\u2019t agree on this specific thing.

We\u2019ve talked about it and he feels bad.
