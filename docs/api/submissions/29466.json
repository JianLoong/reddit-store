At some point it had come up that my husband and I are looking to buy a part time residence outside of our state. I explicitly had told my husband beforehand that I didn\u2019t want to tell people. But he has a hard time keeping things from his sister. \n\nSo, his sister and her husband start asking us what we are looking for. I sheepishly give them a high-level. After discussing for roughly a half hour, my sister in law says, \u201cI have a great idea. Why don\u2019t we all go in on one together?\u201d Both of our husbands enthusiastically agree. I was not so enthusiastic.\n\nSome additional detz:\n\n- SIL and BIL weren\u2019t able to afford their current house on their own. They both received substantial financial assistance from parents on both sides.\n\n- SIL and BIL have filed for bankruptcy independently within the last 10 years.\n\n- SIL and BIL have no concept of saving. They spend their money at a ridiculous rate.\n\n- I\u2019m the only person with enough liquidable assets to put down a deposit on another house.\n\nI calmly just shrug and say, \u201cLarge investments with family can get messy. I\u2019d rather we just buy it alone. I already decided I\u2019m selling off some of my stock to fund this. We\u2019ll be okay. Thanks.\u201d\n\nMy SIL\u2019s face instantly falls and she replies, \u201cDo you think you\u2019re better than us? Just because you made some lucky investments? Your money is technically my brother\u2019s money. If you two can\u2019t agree y\u2019all have problems.\u201d I laughed and said, \u201cNo, I just think you\u2019re risky investment partners.\u201d\n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken since.

You merely responded to her with facts based on her prior financial history.  Suggestion: pick a place they cannot easily afford to go to so that won\u2019t be asking you to share.", "NTA. There's family drama right now and the joint investment didn't even happen. Imagine how much worse it would have been if you did go in on a property together.", "NTA - if just an initial \"no\" caused this much trouble, imagine how much bigger it would be when the shower starts leaking, the plumber is called, and they don't want to pay their share. Or their friends use it and leave a mess for you. Or the roof needs to be replaced. Your first answer was fine. The follow-up, not so much . . .", "NTA and do NOT let your husband wear you down on this.   Her vitriol when you politely declined is ALL the reason to know you made the right call, aside from their sketchy financial history.", "NTA SIL is causing drama already. You were honest when pressed. If you are risking the most capital, you get to make the call on investment partners. Also, if your husband in anyway agrees that 'your money is his money' and is open to the idea of a partnership with people who are so clearly a bad investment choice, get a post nup or paperwork protecting your money.", "NTA. Family and finances don't mix, and this is a prime example of it.", "Nta and do not give in. In addition to all the pitfalls already being pointed out by other posters, they would have equal rights to the property as in they could decide to move in and not leave. You would eventually be able to solve it but the legal bills would be high. If I was you I would figure out a way to buy it on your own without your husband. You would likely need a postnup for that. Your husband will be a nightmare with letting his family use your property.", "NTA  your response to her comment totally inappropriate comment was perfect", "NTA. You have a husband problem. Sort out legality before your husband drags his sister into it again. Post-nup to protect your investments.", "NTA.\n\nMy family had properties in common, it can be a nightmare when divvying up chores, repairs and maintenance and expenses.\n\nOne small example, in August my brother emptied a shed, stuff strewn across the yard.  He never took what could be recycled to the depot, nor the garbage to the dump.  He left a sofa that was in dry storage out in the rain. 2+ months later he had not put it away.", "ESH\n\nYou have the funds, and therefore, the power of veto.
