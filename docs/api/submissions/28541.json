He went and added other stuff you both didn\u2019t agree upon without consulting you. Pretty cut and dry. You\u2019re point of view is completely valid and he needs to work on communication and working as a team", "NTA\n\nLike another comment said, he added things without talking to you about it. He might be going easy because its his friends. However, its both of your house. Its your space too. You agreed to have them out by christmas and he re-neged, id be mad too. Plus hes given them even more of a reason to \"stay longer\" by agreeing to drop the rent", "NTA your boyfriend chickened out and made it seem like it was fine for them to stay longer. Do you have it in writing that they have to leave by Christmas? Did they pay a deposit? If it's not in writing they might be able to stay longer.", "NTA. Nip this in the bud now or you could be looking at the rest of your relationship. Assuming you did in fact truly buy the house together in the legal sense you have as much right and control over who resides in it as he does. I'm sure he is just trying to be supportive and friendly but he is compromising your relationship and wishes to do so and putting others above you, does not bode well.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been pretty flexible so far. Expecting your partner to stick to his word, is kind of a basic thing in a healthy relationship.", "NTA. You should never rent to friends because they will abuse that friendship. And if they\u2019re using up your things and trashing them in your own home? Hard no from me", "No, you're not!!! Having people outside of your relationship live with you is the worst thing you can do for a relationship. It will end up making you resent each other. He needs to give them a firm date and bottom line. You were absolutely within your right to be upset!", "You need to have a serious talk about decision making in your shared property. He fucked up big time but things can turn around still. \nI can\u2019t believe he invited his friends to live in your house without asking you first!", "NTA... you both need to agree that no one moves in or visits UNLESS you both agree to it. Each time there is an agreed visitor there is a leaving date and expectations for hosts and guests.\n\nCOMMUNICATE like adults", "NTA - You got two new roommates you didn't know by circumstances you didn't create. What was supposed to be about you and your relationship is now a shared community space. It's causing friction in your relationship. Now your bf is changing the stipulations of the verbal contract he made with you to appease the renters you didn't ask for, then makes YTA because he broke his word to you. I can appreciate helping a friend in need, but they need to get their own place and if you don't put your foot down, it will be Easter, then the 4th of July, and so on.", "NTA\n\nyour husband brought a friend you didn't even know to live in your house and he even found a girlfriend (even though he lived in other people's houses) he invited her to live in the house that isn't even his, they pay or rent it practically only when they want. It doesn't help at all, and your husband gets mad at you for complaining about it?", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t boot them out on Christmas but I\u2019d probably say Jan 31.  But they need to be out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Giiiirrrrrllllll!!!!\n\nYou cray...!\n\nYou literally have a business partner that is making business decisions without you...", "NTA but you need to get a formal notice written up and given to them so that if/when they decide they aren't moving out, you can start eviction proceedings. Bad roommates are rarely easy to get rid of.", "NTA.  This relationship isn't working.  Your BF.  Has absolutely zero respect for you.  What is your exit strategy?  Hopefully your name is on the mortgage.  So you can force a sale.   \n    \nStop letting your BF do this.  Tell them they need to be gone.  If they try and stall.  Serve them eviction paperwork.", "NTA. Your bf needs to stop being a doormat. Maybe you should be the one to talk to them instead.", "NTA. You bought a house together. He doesn't have the right to allow others to live there when you say no.\n\nGive them notice for Nov 30th. Put it in writing", "He said he will take back what he said and I feel super bad for them. I don\u2019t want anyone to be angry at me", "Exactly! And so far they\u2019ve made no effort or shown us that they\u2019re gonna move out or find another place. No doubt they will take up that offer and stay longer.", "There\u2019s no contract or anything.", "I feel because I\u2019m angry if I say something it\u2019s not going to sound very nice. \n\nI know you guys were told that you can stay longer than Christmas if you need to, but unfortunately we are unable to host you guys longer than Christmas?", "I have been, he told me that the girlfriend was moving in, he didn\u2019t ask me.", "I will never live or rent with someone else ever again. They are definitely taking advantage of us", "I always tell him when I have a friend coming over or family visiting.", "Hopefully they are gone before Christmas. \n\nThey definitely do need to leave. I\u2019ve just found out that the friend has used our ensuite before even though he has his own bathroom and he always asks his friends for money.", "They told my boyfriend that they\u2019re planning to leave in 7 weeks. I will hold them to that and I\u2019ll ask them how their packing is going.", "That\u2019s understandable. And to be honest they probably will be upset. But your reasons for wanting them out make sense. Only one at fault if things get tense is your boyfriend because it wouldt have been as awkward if he just said Christmas and that\u2019s that.", "Op, if you dont want people to be angry at you just tell them what they want to hear.  Such as stay as long as you want.\n\nIts ok for people to get angry.  Tell youy husbands friends to be out of the house by what ever date.  Go get a legal eviction notice to go along with what you said.\n\nThis your house too.  Take charge of your life and quit waiting for someone else to deliver bad/uncomfortable news.  Thats life.", "You're very vulnerable in this situation.  Make sure to give them written warning of when they're expected to leave. \n\n\nMake sure the next people who live with you pay a deposit.  Use something like splitwise so you can calculate who owes what for toilet paper arms other bills.  If they leave owning you money you take it out of the deposit.  \n\nMake a cleaning schedule.", "He created this mess so he needs to sort it out, it's got nothing to do with you. You were clear with what you wanted and your expectations and he completely ignored that and did his own thing. Now he has to live with the consequences and be the \"bad guy\".", "OP depending on where you live you may have a MAJOR problem now.  Because of certain laws put in place to help protect renters, your 'renters' may now have the means to stay indefinitely, regardless of what you want or the original nature of the agreement.  \n\nYou AND boyfriend NEED to sit down and look at those laws together.  Because your boyfriend may have effed up your own housing situation and he needs to see what his 'charity' may cost the both of you.", "Kind of my point. You\u2019ve been flexible, and you set a clear limit which he agreed to, then violated. That doesn\u2019t bode well, in my opinion.", "Absolutely gone.  Christmas is just a weird deadline to me.  But yeah they need out.\n\nFor me, the audacity is being messy.  I\u2019ve had someone put me up before, and I have a service dog. And yet I stuck to my room, brief and clean use of the kitchen, and did my best to be invisible."]}
