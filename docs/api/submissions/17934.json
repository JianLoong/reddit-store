She has coats and refuses to wear them because she doesn't like how they look.  That is absurdly childish.  Nope.  She can be cold, or learn to bring a damn coat.", "ESH. Yes your girlfriend should have brought a coat. That\u2019s fair, to not want to have to sacrifice your own coat because she constantly fails to bring her own. However, speaking to her harshly like that in front of other people wasn\u2019t cool. That\u2019s a sentiment you should have saved for a private conversation. \n\nMoving forward, just put one of her jackets in the car. If she\u2019s cold, she can have the one in the car. If it doesn\u2019t match her outfit, she can choose between discomfort or mismatch. \n\nYou should know there\u2019s no evidence that physically being cold makes you sick. You\u2019re sick because you were spending time in close quarters with someone else who was sick. People get sick more often when it\u2019s cold out because they tend to stay indoors more and germs are spread more easily in closed spaces, as compared to outdoors.", "NTA - mostly. look - you are both young. Weird stuff happens in relationships and you either learn to deal with it, change, or its an issue forever. ie - its not about the coat.  \n\nShe doesn't want to bring a coat but expects you to give up yours as its the right thing to do. That is an inbalance in a relationship. So you can either bring her a coat (I have done something similar to this), help her understand why it bugs you (its not about the coat its about respect), or let it fester forever (I have also done this....)   \n\nThis is just a microcosm of what being in a long-term healthy relationship is like. There are inbalances. I had an SO that was always late- I hate being late. It is a huge deal to me to be late. So I am usually very early. I knew I was being rude by demanding they get there early like me. But I was not being rude by asking them to come my way, be on time, as it really bothers me. So they worked at it and we were on time to most everything.   \n\nLittle things like this can be mini red flags that either get worked out or start become something bigger. Like not doing the dishes quickly, or spending more money that you agreed to, or driving erratically, etc etc. It is about respect, boundaries, and the ability to co-exist in that space. Mutual respect.  \n\nSo yeah, let her know how you feel when you are at a party like that and now you have to be cold because she refused to bring a coat. That it feels disrespectful and rude. Ask her if she wants you to bring her a jacket at times like this or if she can start bringing one just in case?", "ESH she needs to learn to bring a jacket, and you need to learn to say no to a request if you\u2019re going to be passive aggressive about it later.\n\nIf you\u2019re going out with her and know it\u2019s going to be cold, maybe you could clearly tell her (before you go out) that she might need a jacket, and if she doesn\u2019t bring one you will not be sharing yours.\n\nRelationships typically work better with clear communication, expectation, and boundaries.", "NAH - but the solution is so simple.

Why infantilise women?", "I did talk to her about, twice maybe which led to this little outrage, but yeah, maybe the path is \"tough love\" and let her learn a bit.", "There's being a \"gentleman\" and then there's being a patsy. Had it been a one-off, like you said, then yes, the gentlemanly thing to do would be to offer her your coat, but this is a pattern. Even Sir Walter Raleigh would be getting a little testy by now. Your choice is do you allow the pattern to continue, or do you break it by not catering to her inability to check weather forecasts and bring outerwear?", "A lady should not impose unreasonably on a gentleman, if you\u2019re going to adhere to those gendered standards.", "Phat psychedelic style XL hoodie thrifted", "Well\u2026 sort of. If your version of tough love is \u201clittle outrage,\u201d then no.

It\u2019s more than fair to say (politely) that you\u2019d really appreciate her remembering a coat because it\u2019s not fair that she makes you cold regularly. Relationships are a split effort, and she should put as much effort into your feelings as much as you do for hers.

This is an old wives tale based on a poor understanding of hypothermia and the fact people tend to get sick during fall and winter (due to the fact that that they spend more time indoors surrounded by other people).

This was a regular thing for them to argue about. I told her no, today she was not going to have a back up for his stubbornness. He got chilly that evening. Asked his mom where his coat was and got upset to learn it was in the hotel room where he left it. So he was chilly that evening until we all went back to the hotel from the night tours.

Not good or amazing or anything. Just cold", "Better yet just stop giving her your coat even if you don't need it right then. Sounds like she won't start bringing her own unless you start refusing to let her use yours. I have a few coats but not due to fashion. The only reason I have multiple is because they are for different levels of cold or for rain. I could care less if it matches what I am wearing. My mother on the other hand, wouldn't even go to the grocery store without changing her clothes first if they wouldn't match her coat when it was cold. She got mad at me because I was making a run to the grocery store and wouldn't wait for her to change clothes first because I didn't have time for her to primp. She got all whiny about it not matching, so I left her home. A coat is to keep you warm. It does not always have to be a fashion statement. Especially for a quick late evening dash to the grocery store. If you won't wear the coat because it doesn't match, you need to be willing to take the consequences of that action, whether it be to be cold or wet, or whatever the case may be. Your gf doesn't but she expects you to give up your coat that you brought to be dressed appropriately for the predicted weather. She is an adult. If she doesn't bring her coat, let her suffer the consequences but keep your coat for yourself. She has been warned. NTA.", "NTA.  I don't blame you for being harsh about it.
