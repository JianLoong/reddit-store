Unfortunately this is not new behavior and there was no reason for her not coming over besides her just not caring to see the family. I was already upset with her because during our last interaction she referred to me and a few other family members as \u201cfatties\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d. We\u2019ve all always been so kind and generous to her, so this came completely out of left field and was hurtful. \n\nSince she didn\u2019t come over for Christmas and had been so disrespectful lately, I decided not to go out of my way to give her gift to her siblings to take back home with them. I live far away and this is one of the only times of year that I can even see her. If she couldn\u2019t even make an effort to come and see me then I didn\u2019t want to reward that behavior.\n\nMost of my family supports me on taking the gift back, but my dad said that she is just a kid and I should have just sent her gift home with her siblings instead. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672808103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102uehb/aita_for_taking_back_a_kids_christmas_gift/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Never reward behavior like that, the kid won't appreciate it and will just grow up feeling entitled.", "NTA you get gifts when you can show up and say thank you.", "Nah NTA you would be one if you gave it to her and took it back but you never even gave it to her to begin with anyway lol", "NTA - \"just a kid\" should have been made to come to xmas with the family.", "NTA \ud83d\ude05", "NTA - She doesn't deserve a gift and she is already spoiled enough. And it's not like you actually gave it to her then took it back.", "NTA - Santa would have given her coal, you chose to not give her anything. so in a way you were nicer than Santa", "Ehhh Soft YTA here. She\u2019s 13, do you remember what it was like being a teenager? & she knows she had a gift at your place bc more than likely her siblings saw it.\n\nIf you were \u201calready upset with her\u201d for calling you \u201cstupid/fatties\u201d then why did you buy her a gift in the first place? I would\u2019ve just waited til she came over again, obvs it was gonna be awhile since she lives far - that in itself could be punishment.", "YTA Y'all are acting like children, but at least she has an excuse.  Teenagers are dumb little shits and you could have easily told her how her behavior impacted you without bringing the gift into it. \n\nYou've now established that your relationship with her is transactional. If you don't get what you want from her, then she's basically cut off. I predict this will lead to you being on the \"basically forgot\" list as she grows older.", "You didn't take the gift back off the child if the child doesn't bother to come visit you to get it. Why reward antisocial behaviour?\n\nNTA", "YTA. Aren't you supposed to be the adult in this relationship? A 13 year old child hurt your feelings so you're gonna cancel Christmas over it?

I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt with the name calling and chalk it up to being a bad day. I had a card here for each of my cousins with money in it and handed it to each of them when they came in. She never came and therefore never got her card."]}
