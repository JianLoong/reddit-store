So me (28M) and my GF (30F) have been together for 8 years and we have been living together for 4 years. GF has always been the artsy type and always has some personal project going but she has the tendency to get lost in her own world.\n\nWe celebrated my birthday last weekend and she ended up getting me a pencil lengthier. I don't use pencils and the lengthier in question didn't even fit your typical No.2, it was purely for colored pencils, I also don't color. When she asked me if I liked it, I just quietly walked outside our home and tossed it in the trash. She was understandably upset and called me an AH for doing that claiming that I could have least tried it.\n\nHere's the thing, she has been doing things like this ever since we started living together. She has been gifting me things that she likes and ultimately ends up using them. For example, last year she got a packet of Sailor Moon stickers. I don't watch Sailor Moon and she ended up using them all. She also gifted me a jewelry box one time. I don't wear jewelry so guess who's been using it all this time. First world problems at its finest.\n\nSo its been a few days and she's still upset and has even got both of our parents to berate me for trashing the gift. She even admitted she knew I would hate it and was planning on using it after I \"calmed down\" in a few days, a detail that she did share with others but I am still getting name called. Am I really the AH?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Nearly every comment says we need to talk about this. The thing is we have and more than once. She admitted she does this because she wants something but decides to gift it to me to say \"I tried\". I asked if I gave her a wish list would that help and she said that she would never look and it and well she didn't when I made and sent one to her. She on the other hand does have a wish list which I do get her stuff from and some of that stuff is actually expensive.", "created_utc": 1679527904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11z101l/aita_for_trashing_the_gift_my_girlfriend_got_me/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does she plan on pulling the same crap for the birthdays of your children? Does she do it for her family's birthdays, friends'? Or does she only do it to you because she knows you're the only one who'll take the lack of respect?", "NTA. Seriously she is buying you gifts for herself. She makes a habit of this. Have you turned it around on her yet? For the next gift you give her, get her something you really want (and she won't want). When she gets pissed about that, explain that you thought that was how your relationship worked, since she buys things she wants when you get a gift.", "After the comments, I\u2019d say NTA. Honestly if I were in your place I would just not accept gifts nor give them to her anymore until she commits to actually getting you something you\u2019d enjoy like you do for her (but I\u2019m pretty comfortable being an ah with whoever feels like being an ah to me first, so I may be wrong lol)", "What the heck are you doing with someone so incredibly selfish, entitled, and unkind? \n\nNTA but\u2026..OP", "OK. So everyone is this situation is the AH. Her for gifting you something she knows you won't use and disregsrding your wishlist and you for just trashing the gift. \n\nBut overall- why are you in this toxic relationship?", "What's a lengthier?", "NTA. She knows how you feel about this and does it anyway. In no way does this say she tried. Next time, take the gift, keep it but don't use it, then use it next time you give her a gift since you know she wants it. Better yet, give her a gift you want, then once she opens it and looks at it confused, grab it, say 'whoops! That's for me!' and give her her gift.", "NTA\u2026\n\nOP, I really think you need to rethink this relationship\u2026and then RUN!\n\nYour GF openly admits she deliberately gifts you things she knows you hate and ultimately will use herself.. And her wish list is has expensive stuff\u2026? She couldn\u2019t care less about your feelings or you.\n\nYou\u2019ve already talked about this? And she still does this?\n\nForget rethinking this relationship.  JUST RUN.\n\nEdit: Yes trashing the gift was extreme and in other circumstances, an AH move. But considering her actions, I give that a pass.", "**Edit:** After reading OP\u2019s edit and comments, I\u2019m switching to NTA. Yeah, throwing the gift away wasn\u2019t the best move, but it sounds like the GF knowingly engages in this behavior and OP has tried to articulate why he\u2019s hurt. Idk, sounds like an interesting relationship dynamic but I\u2019ll leave it at that since I\u2019m no expert.\n\nHonestly this is a soft ESH, bordering on NTA in my opinion. You acted pretty immaturely but I can understand where your hurt feelings are coming from. Soft AH move throwing the gift away like that though.\n\nIt sounds like this is a repeated pattern with your GF \u201cgifting\u201d you things that are really for her. I\u2019d be sad if someone constantly gave me \u201cgifts\u201d that weren\u2019t really for me too, especially if it was a life partner. That is pretty shitty of her.\n\nYou each could work on your communication abilities - sit down, apologize (both of you), and talk this issue out so you can move past it like adults instead of children. If you can calmly and maturely articulate why her actions are hurtful and/or frustrating to you, then hopefully she meets you half way and changes her behavior as well.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to high road you either, we\u2019re all guilty of letting our frustrations out in weird ways but just try to work on it in the future (this is something I remind myself often as well)!", "NTA. But why are you with someone who is so selfish? Eight years of this? She doesn't give a fuck.\n\nEdit: changed to NTA because I would do the same thing.", "NTA - From the edit it sounds like you've tried to explain how rude and disrespectful it is to do this but especially on purpose. I bet she would throw a fit if you did this to her.", "NTA.  This is a \"Homer gets Marge a bowling ball\" situation.  She repeatedly gets you things that she likes and wants, she even admits that she does this, according to your edit.  She is showing no real consideration for you on your birthday.  It's bizarre to me that she has no interest in actually getting you something you would like, especially since you have said you do get her presents from her own list.  It's up to you whether or not this is a deal-breaker.", "Why are you together? \n\nEither she is selfish or completely unaware.\n\nSet a new rule - no gift giving. If you want something, you buy it for yourself. If you want birthday or christmas gifts, buy it yourself.", "She\u2019s an AH for the gift and you\u2019re an AH for your reaction lol", "NTA, your girlfriend is the AH for giving you gifts that She wants. That's such bs. No thought of you at all, smh.", "ESH - You for throwing her present away and her for being a shitty present giver.\n\nNext time just put her gift for you away and give it to her next time. And as she effectively brought her own present, you can spend the saved money on yourself!\n\nProblem solved, no issues.", "Definitely NTA for being unhappy with the gift but... GF is showing how selfish and me oriented she is, and how little she actually cares about what you think. She gives you a wish list with expensive presents but admits buying you things she wants because she knows she will end up with them. She is probably less upset that you didn't like it than that you threw it away because now she won't get the cheap item she gifted to you. You really need to think about whether you will be happy always being second to her. And if you have children, will presents she buys for your children also in reality be for her? Not something children would ever understand. Maybe throwing the gift was a bit too far, but maybe it should have been the girlfriend not the pencil lengthener that was tossed out.", "ESH. I have to ask. Do you ever get her gifts?", "Everyone sucks- you suck for throwing it out and she sucks for knowingly getting you shitty gifts.", "ESH. Because while it was an incredibly AH move to throw it away in her face, you were fed TF up with her constantly selfish behavior. And then she had the nerve to ask you if you liked it, knowing that you wouldn't and it would be an excuse for her to use it \"since it's just sitting around.\"\n\nIt was rude asf to do this in her face, you should have confronted her about her behavior. But I also understand how miffed you had to be.", "ESH but you should have directly talked to her about this way beforehand if it\u2019s something you say she\u2019s does constantly\n\n\n Was surprised at her age too", "You both suck. Walking outside and throwing it in the trash? That\u2019s a dick move. Imagine someone doing that to you.\n\nBut continually giving gifts you know are really for yourself? That\u2019s pretty shitty of her.\n\nHave an adult conversation with her. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I handled things the way I did. That wasn\u2019t cool. It was pent up frustration and I handled it badly. But you have a pattern of buying me gifts that aren\u2019t really for me. (Example 1) (Examples 2 and 3). How would you like it if for your next birthday I got you a (something you like that you know she wouldn\u2019t like or use) knowing I would just be able to take it and use it myself? It would feel like I didn\u2019t really care about what makes YOU happy.\u201d\n\nEdit: just read your edit. Wow\u2026 that is one very selfish woman. You\u2019re making it so, so easy for her to do better. Is this really the kind of human you want to spend your life with? Don\u2019t throw gifts in the trash in fits of puerile rage\u2026 but don\u2019t put up with consistent disrespect for your needs. I know walking away is hard, but she\u2019s not going to change. Do you want to put up with this the rest of your life? If you have kids, do you want them to learn that this is an ok way for mommy to treat daddy, and for them to treat their future partners? This is bare minimum stuff, my dude.", "Yes. Walking out and trashing it like a drama queen makes you an asshole. She's also an ass for giving you stuff that she knows you won't use.   \n\n\nYou're meant to talk about your feelings and about your expectations, not act like you acted here.   \n\n\nESH.", "ESH. You\u2019re an AH for throwing it out and she\u2019s the AH for getting gifts for you that are self serving to her. It sounds like there\u2019s a lot of resentment that has came from somewhere.\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting to continue the relationship, I\u2019d make sure to work on both of your communication skills and get down to the real root of the problem. Seems to me there\u2019s a real disconnect going on.\n\nEDIT: added a left out word.", "ESH\n\nIt's rude to trash a gift anyone gets you regardless of how much it costs, if you like it, etc. It's especially rude to do it right in front of that person, immediately after you open it.\n\nBut I do understand why you did it. It's really crappy that she keeps getting you things she likes so she can use them. She needs to just buy herself those things and then put the effort into giving you something you would like.\n\nI'm not trying to be rude and obviously this question oversimplifies a very long and probably complicated history that you have with her, but why are you with someone like this? I spent 3+ years and 4 birthdays with someone who conveniently went on business trips on my birthday and never had time to get me a gift because he was traveling. He literally would not travel at all the rest of the year and then a super important business trip would come up 2 days before my birthday and he wouldn't get back until several days after. And he would never make it up to me, there were no gifts, no cards, no apologies, sometimes he didn't even call me. And looking back, I realized he was traveling on my birthday because he didn't want to be with me on my birthday. Because my birthday didn't matter to him. And my birthday didn't matter to him because my feelings didn't matter to him. And if my feelings didn't matter to him, why should I have spent that time in a relationship with him? There's a bigger pattern here and that's a red flag and you deserve better.\n\nSo yeah, a little bit AH that you trashed the gift right in front of her immediately after she gave it to you but I can completely understand why you did.", "Imma go with YTA, but it's just one of those times you should be. I would have done the same. Break up if it keeps dragging on. She sounds broken.", "ESH. You two sound like children.", "**NTA**\n\nI don't think you are compatible.  Gifts mean something to you and she knows it.   She chooses to ignore that and you get your feelings hurt   This will not get better.   You will never get over wanting something that shows she's trying to bring a bit of extra joy to *you* and every time she buys these gifts for yourself, it hurts.    You will never stop being hurt by that.", "You both suck", "ESH. You didn't need to throw it in the trash, and she needs to stop \"gifting\" you things with the sole intent of using them herself. Tell her that if she wants to get something for herself, then she should just do that, instead of pretending that she's doing something nice for you.", "ESH It sounds like you need to sit her down and tell her you're no longer giving each other gifts if it will always be so one sided.", "ESH.  Stop buying presents for each other.  You will never be disappointed with what you get.", "YTA. Tell them you don't like it. You have a mouth.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We were fortunate to inherit enough land to feed our small family since my husband was the only child of his parents.

(I can't stand chocolate, but he loves it, so I enjoy seeing his face light up every year when I give him his gift.) Sometimes I find agricultural work during harvest or planting season, sometimes I can earn a bit helping fisherman clean and prep an especially large catch for market, but I always find a way.\n\nHe does the same kind of extra work for my birthday every year. I understand the sacrifice, I do the same thing for him. But instead of some marzipan, candied lemon peels, sugared dates, or even just picking some wildflowers to let me know he's thinking of me, he just gifts me chocolate (which he knows I cannot stand). He says that I should be flattered by his gifts since he waits for 3 or 4 days before eating my birthday chocolate, but I don't think that really counts since he admitted he only buys me chocolate since he knows I won't eat it.
