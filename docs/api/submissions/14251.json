If I were you, I'd reconsider living together this minute, getting myself somewhere else to stay while I rethink the engagement and the relationship.", "Obviously NTA   She is responsible for her own self-control.  You should be able to eat how you chose not forced to accept her  choice.  And expecting you to serve a guest protein shakes, wtf!", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e's eating restrictions belong to her and her alone. ESPECIALLY since they're semi self-imposed (not allergy  induced).\n\nShe's being selfish and self-centered expecting others to follow her dietary whims.\n\nShe's also a pretty bad hostess, but that's a different thread...", "NTA, wtf, you literally went on a liquid diet when you didn\u2019t have to, she trippin\u2026 then she wasted your money by throwing food out, she out of pocket.", "NTA\n\nSo if she ends up having to get one of her legs amputated, she'd expect you to support her by chopping one of your legs off in solidarity?  She wouldn't allow anyone with two legs through the door?  That's as unrealistic as expecting everyone in her home to stick to a liquid diet.  Part of losing weight is learning new eating habits and exercising your willpower.  You still have to live in a world where you'll be surrounded by temptation and you need to practice saying, \"No thank you.  I'm good with this protein shake.\"  It sounds like she's setting unrealistic expectations so that when you inevitably start eating normally again around her she can blame you for her failure to stick to her new eating requirements.", "Her expectations are absurd.  When you are on an extremely limited diet like that, it should be a) a diet designed for you and b) medically supervised.  Expecting you to stay on a diet designed to lose weight indefinitely when you\u2019re not intending to lose weight is\u2026I don\u2019t even have the words to describe how inappropriate that is.\n\nMy husband has done very low calorie, mostly liquid diets to try to lose weight due to years of emotional eating and an unhealthy relationship with food.  We talked and I agreed not to have some of his very favorite meals in the house or around him, because that made things easier for him.  We set up some opaque tubs to hold my  food (especially snacks) so he wasn\u2019t looking at them every time he walked through the kitchen.  But that was the limit of me changing my diet/food habits to accommodate his severe diet.  He was reluctant to even ask me not to have certain foods in the house, but I insisted on removing things he would find the most tempting because I wanted him to succeed.  The opaque tubs helped more than he expected, because not having constant casual exposure to things he wasn\u2019t supposed to eat made him think about them less.\n\nYes, dieting is hard, but you two have to find a way for her to stay on her weight loss diet while you maintain a normal diet. NTA", "NTA \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA- She has a medical problem and makes you be on the same diet? Heck no. You are allowed to have a boundary there. Also, hello, waste of food!!", "She needs COUNSELING.  How was she not prepared for after surgery?  What she's asking is insane at best.   At the least it's manipulation and gas lighting.  I can't fathom forcing someone to go on that type of diet!  Can you go stay with someone until she's past this point?", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to eat a liquid diet, fine. She does not get to control what other people in the house eat.", "NTA. You did go on the diet with her and support her, and that is great. However, you are also an adult capable of making your own decisions, which means you can choose to stop any time you like. Just as she is an adult and shouldn't be reliant on you for anything more than the moral/emotional support expected of a fianc\u00e9e.\n\nAlso, ignoring the obvious fact that you BOUGHT the food and she has no claim to it, that food, technically, wasn't for you. You really bought it to treat your brother. So, not only is she trying to dictate what YOU can eat, she's also trying to control the diet of anyone who comes to your home. She is the major AH in this situation and you two should probably sit down and have a serious talk about control, respecting boundaries, and what exactly constitutes \"supporting\" her diet. Otherwise you (and everyone else in your life) are going to be living off protein shakes until you die. Which, trust me, will make people dislike your fianc\u00e9e at best and straight-up isolate you from them at worse.", "I don't understand why she is on an all liquid diet several months after weight loss surgery. She should have been on solids after a couple of weeks.", "NTA- If you tried it and were consistently losing weight, keeping with it would probably be unhealthy for you as you would just keep losing. I know there's more than just that, but that's just one point.", "NTA: how rude of her", "NTA. Are you sure you want to marry this girl? That's an absolutely ridiculous position for her to take. She needs to learn that the whole world doesn't bend over backwards so she won't be tempted to eat something. That's something a three year old expects, not a supposedly grown woman.", "NTA she doesnt understand that being supportive doesnt mean doing the diet too. You did it and accomplished your goal, you deserve to eat the food you buy now.", "NTA\n\nHER choice was to have WLS.", "There are people suffering from malnutrition and outright starvation. In other places, good food gets thrown out for...reasons. NTA.", "NTA. Wow. She is acting ridiculously entitled and you were already *more* than generous for joining her in consuming a liquid-only diet for a few weeks. She needs to get a grip. Throwing out perfectly good food that you were going to cook for your brother is incredibly immature, wasteful, and childish of her. Full stop.\n\nLet\u2019s say you were celiac. Or diabetic. Would she mimic the diet recommended to you by your doctor that isn\u2019t required for her health needs but would be specifically catered to yours, despite it being an unnecessary modification to her own nutritional routine that would not be necessary or confer the same benefits it would to you, the person who actually needs it? Of course she wouldn\u2019t!!!! Why should you? \n\nThink carefully before moving forward with marriage with this individual. I highly doubt this behaviour is an isolated incident.", "NTA\n\nShe's going way too far. She can't control what you buy, eat or cook for yourself.", "NTA so you being supportive of her means your extended family needs to be as well, that\u2019s pushing it a bit", "NTA.  Buckle up though.", "What would she want you to do if her leg was broken & she needed to use crutches? \n\nHer lack of self-control has nothing to do with you.\n\nNTA", "She\u2019s going to have to control herself because people eat food.  I could understand if he was bringing home cupcakes and Twinkies but she is ridiculous to think your brother should have a smoothie for dinner because that\u2019s all she gets to eat.", "NTA Your GF is being unreasonable. I wouldn't go on a liquid diet for weeks or longer to appease someone. There is no reason for everyone to suffer for a problem she has. This is food. It isn't alcohol or cigarettes. I can see not eating in front of her, but not having any food in the house at all is a bit much.\n\nIt's really concerning that she is not giving you any consideration. This seems very selfish to me.", "NTA. \n\nmaybe she feels betrayed because she thinks you are supposed to do what she does and have a big ole conversation about all the times you want to do something different.  but throwing out your food? that ain't right", "NTA, looking at solid food doesn't hurt her diet", "NTA. Sounds like she has some self control issues. She made the choice to go on a diet and shouldn't be forcing anyone else to do so if they don't want to. She also can't expect you not to bring food into the house for you, and certainly not for a guest.", "NTA, I am very much into the \"to each their own\" philosophy. I don't have an issue with anything anyone does unless they're hurting someone else in the process or encroaching onto others' \"to each their own\" right, the latter of which insisting someone stays on the same diet as you falls under, unfortunately for your fiance. Additionally, I'd honestly be pretty angry if I bought something and come home to discover someone has just thrown it away as well.", "NTA. Even if you agreed to do the liquid diet for a while, that\u2019s not a sustainable way for you to live, especially because you\u2019re not the one that had the surgery. And then expecting guests to also adhere to that diet? Absolutely not", "NTA\n\nYou already did go on a strict diet with her and keeping such restrictions without medical need can be detrimental to your health. It is unreasonable of her to make other people eat only the things she can eat. \n\nIf she can't cope with her dietary restrictions maybe she should look for a therapist to help because at this point and with this mindset she will probably gain weight back (throwing your food out definetly is not the answer).", "NTA It's good your fiance is doing something good about her weight issues but she has no business imposing them onto you. Set new boundaries with her. Tell her to start dealing with other food in the house and learn to deal with her temptation. Also tell her to start paying you back for the wasted food. And make it clear to her that you have a right to eat and keep regular food in the house.", "NTA.  It is so uncool to expect that a guest in your home go on a liquid diet.", "NTA. I feel like she\u2019s asking you to start having an eating disorder (major food restrictions for non-medical reasons is a sign of disordered eating) and is mad you don\u2019t want to engage, even if it\u2019s not her intention. You should listen to what your body wants and needs. That\u2019s more helpful to both you and her.", "Ask her if this is the post surgery eating plan her bariatric surgeons suggested - because I know from personal experience it won\u2019t be. \n\nOne of the main purposes of bariatric surgery is that should a person succumb to temptation the surgery takes over. It takes away the possibility of eating too much, especially that soon after surgery. She\u2019ll either feel full after a couple of bites or she regurgitate her food. She physically can\u2019t eat the way she used to. If she got the RNY (so not a band) she also risks dumping syndrome which will soon stop her eating too much or the wrong type of foods. \n\nDid she have a psychological assessment before the surgery? In the UK (NHS, not sure about private) it\u2019s compulsory, you can\u2019t get the surgery without one. They have to know you can handle the changes, including and especially the people around you having a normal diet. Did she tell them she could handle it because she thought she could but the reality is different or did she lie? \n\nWhat\u2019s the aftercare like with the bariatric team? If she can access a bariatric psychologist I would suggest making an appointment. Failing that there are a ton of online bariatric support groups that will have advice and support for her - and for you. \n\nI had complications that lead to 7 surgeries over a 4 year period (5 years after the original surgery - which also had complications that needed 2 surgeries and a week in ICU) and have another coming up. All because of my RNY. Online support groups have been a huge help, because the members get it. I can vent or ask for opinions or learn practical tips. Even though my experience has been a total outlier (I\u2019ve been the subject of peer review studies lol) there are always things that all bariatric patients have. \n\nYou are NTA. It sounds like your girlfriend is struggling over and above what is normally expected at this stage. She\u2019s going against all medical, psychological advice by delaying the inevitable, learning to live near sold food. If you back down you\u2019d only be helping her to avoid her new reality. So don\u2019t. \n\nGood luck, to both of you!\n\nETA the first few months were hard. Really hard. Depression has inducing. Her reaction suggests she\u2019s struggling tbh. It doesn\u2019t justify the way she\u2019s treating you but it does justify her getting help.", "NAH\n\nYeesh, when is the wedding?\n\nSounds like communication is an issue.\n\nIsn't the liquid only portion of recovery fairly short, like a few weeks? Then soft foods, and then normal foods. \n\nYes it was rude to throw out your food. It's also incredibly difficult to do what she is doing, and you agreed in advance to help by agreeing to the liquid only diet. \n\nThis is all short term. Move forward.

She shouldn't be punishing you because she lacks self control. It's not like you're sabotaging her by keeping junk food around. This is just regular, solid food.

I'm queasy just remembering them.   She's supposed to introduce solids in extremely small portions within the first 6wks post op- for me, 10 years post op my portions are still super small but I can eat whatever I want (with the exception of sugar, dumping syndrome is no joke) and have been since about 2 years after surgery- you have to really be careful though or you'll end up right back where you started, the surgery is just a tool, not a magic bullet.\n\nPart of the pre surgery process is a psych eval- oftentimes food is an addiction that you are using as a form of self medication, so the risk is that you can develop other extreme behaviors to replace your former source of self soothing- food.  There are also a lot of other emotional and psychological bumps and trials as you go through this process after the surgery, so it's kind of a lot of pressure.  Not to mention the rapid weight loss comes with weird side effects- constantly being cold, hair loss, etc.\n\nThis might be contributing to the fact that she is acting completely irrationally around this issue of what you eat or keeping regular food in the house, just a thought, this might trigger her to the extreme around food in the opposite direction.", "NTA.
