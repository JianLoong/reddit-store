He said that he was only going to have one more, and Emma then said, 'That\u2019s what Dad always used to say, those drinks are killing you.' Mike told her that she was worrying too much, but at this stage, she became very emotional and didn\u2019t seem to listen to him.\n\nShe said that his doctor had already told him about his liver cirrhosis just 3 months ago, and she is terrified of the idea of losing him more than anything. She also said that she worries that his drinking will cause our daughter (her niece) and our unborn child to lose their father, just like she did.\n\nThese were the first drinks that Mike had in about a month, and when he pointed that out, Emma said that it didn't alleviate her fears. I then stepped in and told her that he had it under control and that she was acting too much like a child's nanny. Emma apologized and said that it wasn\u2019t her intention to sound rude or condescending, but she said that she worries about Mike's health and was speaking from a place of fear and insecurity.\n\nI told her that she wasn't unique in feeling that way and that we all worried about Mike\u2019s health.

Emma seems to be the only one not in denial and enabling your husband as he drinks himself to death. *He already has cirrhosis of the liver*. Why the fuck are you just sitting there watching him drink? Why are you having another kid with him who will just have to watch their father slowly waste away? \n\nEmma is trying to give you a serious wake up call. You need to listen instead of insulting her. Your husband is an alcoholic who has already done serious damage to his body. He needs to stop drinking completely, not \u2018limit\u2019 and \u2018keep it under control\u2019.", "YTA \n\nYour SILs fears are incredibly reasonable. You are enabling your husband, and he is putting drinking over being their for his wife and children. \n\nSounds like your SIL approached this as rationally as she could and you just didn\u2019t want to hear it.", "YTA, and I think you and your husband are in complete denial about his alcoholism. His has cirrhosis of the liver? And you think it's okay for him to keep drinking? He doesn't have it under control. Cirrhosis patients are not supposed to be drinking anything, let alone a \"few\" drinks. You don't sound worried about your husband's health at all.", "YTA. Wow are you ever an AH. Do you even care about your husband and the father of your children at all, or are you just scared that if you confronted him about the fact that he's slowly killing himself while you're about to give birth to your second kid, that you already know he'd choose the alcohol over you?\n\nHis sister clearly either cares a lot more about Mike not dying (or needing a liver transplant) in the near future than you do, or you're shockingly ignorant of what your husband's diagnosis means. And BTW, if you think he can just get a liver transplant when he destroys this one . . . one of my friends, a mother of four, has been on the transplant list for over a year, and she didn't destroy hers by choice. Good luck with that.\n\nA cirrhotic liver means that he shouldn't be drinking at all anymore, period. And if he can't live without alcohol (which would, you know, make him an alcoholic) then he should be drinking as little as possible - not \"a few\" at a time. His liver is already well on the way to being destroyed, and those \"few drinks\" are literally killing him right in front of you, and you're shitting on his own sister (who already watched the other THIRD OF THEIR FAMILY DIE FROM DOING EXACTLY THIS) for pointing it out. \n\nOf course YTA. You aren't even looking out for your own family's best interests. You just said incredibly awful, condescending things to your SIL for trying to save your husband's life. She's not behaving like a nanny or trying to infantilize or parent him . . . she's begging him to stop killing himself.", "Am I reading this correctly: Your husband has cirrhosis of the liver?  Or was your SIL referring to her father?  Sorry, just a bit confused.", "So your husband, whose father died of alcoholic liver disease, has cirrhosis of the liver and he\u2019s having multiple drinks in one sitting and you consider that to be him \u201chaving it under control?\u201d\nI mean you do you, I guess.", "YTA.

Please get professional help for him and for yourself.", "His liver is FAILING from alcohol abuse, he doesn't have anything under control if he's still using alcohol.

She is acting like any siblings concerned for their brother would, they watched their father die from alcoholic liver disease and now her brother who already has cirrhosis is having a few drinks and then going for more, her reaction is completely normal and justified and she is absolutely right those drinks are killing him I mean those drinks have already gotten him sick. \n\nWhy aren't you showing more concerned about your husband's health?

He has a father who was an alcoholic and it killed him. \n\nYour husband should not be having any alcohol.  Your husband's sister is 110% in the right here, and you should be backing her up. \n\nUnless you have dreams of being a widowed single mother in your 40s.  \n\nYou have the most vested interest, and a duty towards your children to encourage your husband to stay alive. You all need him. \n\nEven if your FIL was still alive and never was an alcoholic, it is clear from your husband's liver damage that he is.  The actions you need to take are the same. \n\nYou owe your SIL and apology and your husband an intervention.", "YTA and you have your head in the sand. He\u2019s been diagnosed with cirrhosis and is drinking? What. He shouldn\u2019t have any alcohol much less a \u201cfew\u201d drinks.

Address your husband\u2019s drinking, or your kids are going to experience the same loss your husband and his sister did. But much earlier in their lives.", "He will be ineligible for a transplant if he keeps drinking. Alcohol is cool and all but really not worth death and your children growing up without a father. Your sister in law is 100% correct in being upset.", "What, and I cannot stress this enough, *the actual fuck*? \n\nYTA for how you treated Emma to answer your question, but it\u2019s deeply disturbing that you\u2019re more concerned about your AH judgment than you are of your husband who is merrily prancing towards his grave.", "OP, you are being blind. Your husband  has been diagnosed with cirrhosis, and he isn\u2019t even 40. He is well on the road to an early and agonizing death, and you are enabling him. I hope your husband\u2019s finances are in shape, and that he has a current will.", "This is fucking nuts. Your husband is on track to die an awful death. YTA and I\u2019m sorry his sister has to deal with you.", "Perhaps your intonation is what made him feel that way? Also generally I would avoid getting in between sibling wars but it does seem like Emma has some legit concerns. Also you might be a bit of a AH here since I don't think you ought to have spoken to her like that .", "YTA.  She is worried, rightfully so, about her brother.  Drinking is dangerous, especially for someone with his illness.\n\nYou had no business stepping in, especially if your husband is an adult who can speak for himself.  \n\nIt's strange that you seem to lack the empathy and understanding to see that it was traumatic watching their father drink himself to death, and that you are ok with potentially (or likely, as he already has cirrhosis) putting your children through the same thing.\n\nI doubt this is just about grief for her - it seems to be about logic, love for one's family, and the selflessness to speak up knowing she may get flack for doing so.", "YTA.. While you\u2019re ok with your husband drinking himself into an early grave clearly his sister is not. You should be telling your husband the same thing she is because if he continues to drink while having cirrhosis he wont live long enough to see your kids become adults.", "YTA. You\u2019re letting your husband kill himself", "Fuck the AH status, your partner is dying, sort your shit out", "YTA. \n\n1) Her father died of alcoholism, and she doesn't want her brother to die the same way. She is genuinely concerned. \n\n2) Your husband has cirrhosis and is still drinking? Even if it is \"first time in about a month,\" this is stupid. Those drinks really ARE killing him. \n\n3) She has a right to point out alcoholism where alcoholism exists. If your husband doesn't want to listen, that doesn't make her ta for pointing it out. \n\n4) To reiterate, YOUR HUSBAND HAS CIRRHOSIS. THUS HE IS AN ALCOHOLIC. THUS HE SHOULD DRINK ZERO DRINKS EVER and you SHOULD NOT HAVE ALCOHOL IN YOUR HOME.", "ESH. You attacked Emma for worrying about her brother after having watched her father die from alcoholism. She may sound nagging, and she may be butting in when it's not her business. But she's doing so out of concern \n\nHow many are a few drinks? Because it's easy to become an alcoholic with 5 drinks one night, 5 another, and fewer and fewer days between those nights. If it runs in the family, then just sitting there drinking one right after the other for the sake of drinking is a potential problem. \n\nYou say you're also worried about his health, then maybe you should be saying what Emma is saying and thanking her for caring.\n\nMike needs to be aware of how easily a few drinks becomes excessive.", "ESH\n\nHer for being overprotective over something she can't control. She just loves him. \n\nHim for choosing to drink when he already has cirrhosis of the liver, a wife and his second child on the way. He needs help. Also that's pretty selfish. \n\nYou , for choosing to use the word \"nanny.\" That was demeaning to her. Name calling wasn't very nice.\n\nEDIT:  This is always a difficult situation. I've been a hospice nurse for several years. On the one hand, this man has a wife and family, with a second child on the way. On the other hand, he's risking his life. \n\nTrust me, he KNOWS the consequences of his actions. And yes, he and OP both could be in denial. Yes, it's likely he's an alcoholic. It's a disease, too. \n\nBut in the end, it's HIS choice. He can seek help if he chooses to.

Sometimes you can slow it down with things like STOPPING DRINKING. \n\nLook. I had a liver transplant for an auto immune related liver disease last year. Drinking did not cause my liver issues but the moment I showed signs of fibrosis I never drank again. Getting on the liver transplant list is HARD. You realize that to get a new liver you need 6 months proven sobriety to even be considered a candidate at most transplant hospitals? Thats only the beginning. \n\nFuck I am so biased but the liver disease world is small and the amount of people who chose to drink themselves into hospital beds is actually depressing. I get it, alcoholism is a disease but get help. I\u2019m sorry. My auto immune system put me in a hospital bed fighting for my life. How stupid can you be to CHOOSE to take that risk??
