You're all in a tragic situation, and in this case everyone is doing what they think is right. I agree with others who commented it would depend how long she has left and what her medical care needs are.", "NTA. He\u2019s sponging off you.\n\nThe thing about palliative care being provided is something that should have been found well before now(like around the time he moved in?)\n\nAlso, it\u2019s child abuse to not provide a reasonable education for your child\u2026 so keep that in mind about the niece. \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s really all that able to take care of family,  and it\u2019s *really* not your place to do so- you\u2019ve already gone above and beyond. \n\nThe reality is, if you don\u2019t take care of yourself, you can\u2019t take care of others. This isn\u2019t being selfish. This is being responsible.", "NTA His GF needs to be in hospice care. He can visit her daily.\n\nHow do you feel about letting your niece stay with you on the grounds she start attending school? Because honestly, she's being neglected by your brother. And this situation is your brother's doing, not hers.", "Honestly, I want to say on and off for about 5 years, but that possibly they have been friends for much longer than that. I recall meeting her a long long time ago at a New Years party (perhaps 8 or so years ago) and she was his date. However, during his years of couch surfing, he's had a great number of flings and \"roomies\"\n\nMy brother has always had an extremely intricate and complicated social network which is how he kept up with his lifestyle for so long. It's just sad because the last little while, prior to her diagnosis, he seemed to be doing better for himself. \n\nNo, his girlfriend is not the mother of his kid, and I don't actually feel like baby mama wants to be in the picture at all as I haven't heard her be mentioned once this past year.", "This depends on the country and in the US depends on what kind of insurance she has, and most everything except medicaid will only pay for something like 15 hours a week.", "We are not in the US, and health care is free. Palliative paperwork would just make all the \"extras\" that aren't covered by typical healthcare 100% free. \n\nI honestly haven't talked much with my brother about his finances, just because I felt like it wasn't my place to do so. I am also used to footing the bill for him, so it never really occurred to me to ask all the details. \n\nAs for her...Yes, she has family. I can hear them facetiming with her sometimes, but I don't know where or who they are. So far no one has come to my door asking to see her, so I don't know if the relationship she has with them is strained, like that of mine and my brothers, or if they are just too far away.", "I do get mad at him often over the suspicion that he is \"sponging off me.\" Though, I keep reminding myself that I may be basing that off of  the history we have. \n\nOf course he will always be my brother, but he has hurt me a great number of times in the past, and so this time almost feels much more burdensome. It's almost as if I'm in a \"boy who cried wolf\" scenario, expect this time there's actually a wolf that needs dealing with but I'm just so so tired of picking up pieces. It's hard. I see and sense his grief and his position, but I see he's starting to flounder again and take the easy way. \n\nI suppose I just wanted the advice from strangers to make sure my resentment for my brother isn't causing me to make heartless decisions in his time of vulnerability. He is still my brother, he always will be  - so will my niece. But I also want to be there for my wife and to have us on our way to starting our own family.", "Weird. Of everything here, I feel like his daughter not going to school is the biggest \"problem behavior\" to me. I guess she can just repeat a year, but getting split up from your friends is kind of a big deal at that age. I guess it kinda depends what she's doing. Is she spending time with the gf or is she just kinda sitting around doing nothing?\n\nI don't think it's wrong for you to not want these people in your house, especially since your brother is not helping financially and there is a free option for them. However, I also see where your brother is coming from. He probably knows he'd regret it for the rest of his life if he didn't spend every possible second he could with her, and he's probably willing to screw you/your wife over to do it, and I honestly can't blame him for that. In the past, he would be out of work because of laziness/whatever, but now he actually has a pretty good reason to not want to find a job and I think you should respect that.\n\nNot sure what the palliative care options are, but there are legitimate reasons not to want that. Even if it's not their home, it is a home setting and that is going to be a lot more comfortable potentially. \n\nI'm gonna go with a NAH. It's a shitty, tragic situation all around that he finally seemed to be getting his life together and then this happened.\n\nPersonally, if I were you, I would make the decision based on how much time the gf has left. If it's a matter of 1-2 months, suck it up, it's not worth the rift and the conflict between you and your brother at a time when he really doesn't need it. If it's going to be significantly longer than that, then I definitely understand you wanting to force the issue but you will probably get a lot of backlash. If money is becoming an issue, maybe ask your parents for money?", "Is there a reason you all cannot ask about her family?  She may feel like she would be a burden to her brother to move her but she would probably be more comfortable with them and I'm sure a pending death would smooth over a lot of ruffled feathers if there are any.", "This is gonna be a little outta left field and may also be a bit of projection on my part, I apologize for that, but has your brother ever been tested for ADHD? A lot of what you said about his life before this situation (not keeping a steady job/relationship)  as well as this sentence \n\n> but I see he's starting to flounder again and take the easy way\n\ngave me that kind of impression Probably not the best time to look into it now with everything going on but at some point down the line that could be an avenue for him to look into.", "NTA\n\nDude he isn't being a father. TBH it doesn't sound like he has EVER been a father.\n\nHe's neglecting your niece entirely, has taken advantage of everyone and hijacked your home. The grim truth is that all of this just short of her diagnosis is entirely his fault. The homelessness. The child neglect. The house hopping. All of it. Even hijacking your home is his fault. He had no reason to quit his job. He used her condition as an excuse and leapt at it.\n\nIf you don't make him leave he never will and sadly his daughter needs to be removed from his care. If you don't make him go his first excuse will be \"no cuz sad, can't work\". Then it'll be \" you'd abandon your niece\" or \" you don't love me -insert many guilt trips-\"\n\nThe truth is he's circling the toilet bowl and has every intention of taking his daughter down with him.\n\nThis is terribly sad but his bullshit needs to be ended by force now. Enough is enough. He needs an ultimatum.", "NTA- here is why. You are putting them first and putting your need/want to have a family. Not to mention from what you stated, its been a year and your brother will not get a job. They was only staying with you because times where rough. It seems as though they are taking advantage of you and your wife and thats not fair. I don\u2019t blame you or your wife for wanting your life back. It is NOT your responsibility to take care of your brother, your niece and his dying girlfriend", "You're the asshole", "NTA, obviously. \n\nBut\u2026 aside from the girlfriend\u2019s palliative care, I am **horrified** to hear that your niece hasn\u2019t been in school for close to a year! \n\nI don\u2019t know where you live, but in the USA, truancy officers can (and will) get involved, then possibly get Child Protective Services involved as well. Your niece is 15 years old, meaning she\u2019s just a few short years from graduating. The longer she\u2019s out of school, the harder it will be for her to catch up. If your country has special exams for college placements, she\u2019s likely already screwed!\n\nI know this isn\u2019t your responsibility, but \u2014in his grief and mismanagement\u2014 your brother is majorly dropping the ball on that girl\u2019s care! **Please help her, if you can.** Your brother is setting her up for the same kind of future he\u2019s currently living! The tragedy is she\u2019ll likely face her struggles with *far less* patience from your family, because your brother has cashed in on everyone\u2019s empathy and willingness to help already.", "Hospice care is often done at home.", "Ultimately, the question is, how much help and care can you provide, without neglecting responsibilities to your wife (and potential future children,). \n\nI\u2019m reminded of this fairly cultish church my SiL grew up in, where everybody gave until it hurt to help the community. They were very generous people, don\u2019t get me wrong. \n\nBut the reality was, the people that gave everything to help the family that needed it last week were the family that needed help this week. It was all just one big circle jerk of everyone putting problems on others.. causing most of the financial problems in the first place \n\nThe reality was, financial responsibility was ignored, placing them in the position of needing help, when that was totally unnecessary. \n\nWhich, if you\u2019re not in a place to help, you can\u2019t help and trying is just going to make it harder on the people who can- not to mention the niece (and maybe the GF, if her mind is gone to where she can\u2019t make decisions.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t just financial, either. It\u2019s emotional and mental. Responsible adults figure their shit out. And there\u2019s help from the city/county/state if it\u2019s more than one person can do (like the palliative care thing.)\n\nPalliative care for the GF is likely 100% better for her. That will also free if the brother for taking care of his shit- if he wants to. But that\u2019s entirely his choice.\n\n\nI would suggest considering bailing out the niece though. She doesn\u2019t deserve a father like that, if you can.", "Oh, so they have options.\n\nI was going to say NTA anyway, tbh, it\u2019s your house and this doesn\u2019t have to be put on you.\n\nThat being said, I understand your hesitation. It\u2019s a delicate situation and his girlfriend and him are probably at one of the lowest points of their lives. Annnd when I first read this story, I was assuming y\u2019all lived in the United States, where healthcare is this terrifying thing and a serious diagnosis can ruin your health AND finances, even with run of the mill insurance policies. \n\nBut, if healthcare is free, you should definitely talk to him about the benefits of palliative care. Especially for his ability to get on his feet and actually care for his daughter.", "NTA, and she'd be better off in pallative care. Being looked after by professionals.", "UWBTA", "NTA", "NTA... if this is Canada, there are plenty of social services that can be accessed including palliative care units. Many Countries provide low income benefits.\n\nIt was very selfish of your brother to place this burden on you, especially without asking.\n\nYour brother will continue to take advantage of you as long as you enable him.", "I get that you want to move on with your own family plans and that your brother wore out his welcome, but I think you're going about this the wrong way. \n\nFor one, the women is the one who is sick. She is the one you should be bringing your concerns and paperwork to. In what world does your brother get to put his fully cognitive partner in a facility?!? If you want to go this route explain that the financial and emotional burdens are becoming too much to HER and discuss her options. Maybe she has other family she can fall back on. But either way she is the one who needs to make these decisions.\n\nThe second thing is that you're actively watching a minor being neglected. You say she hasn't gone to school and her father is doing nothing about it. I don't know how much his or her actions are influenced by the mother's(?) Illness, but this needs to be adressed. Either by the family as a whole or CPS or your countries equivelant. You might be legally in your right to kick this minor out of your house, but you know its morally wrong. Arrangements need to be made for her if you can no longer put up your brother and his family. You can't just wash your hands off it and tell him to figure it out, when you know he hasn't and probably won't.", "jfc NTA\n\nYou need to get them out of your home.

I'd say this to him, and he may not take it well and you need to be prepared for that and stay calm but say \n\n\"Insert Brothers name, I am very sympathetic to you and your girlfriends situation and it is an awful one but the decision to allow you to stay in my home was on the proviso of sorting out your girlfriends care, this hasn't happened and due to that I have looked in to palliative care as, and I am sorry, but i am not comfortable with someone dying in my home, and there is free care available. For which I'd like you to sign the paperwork this week and get the ball rolling on transporting your girlfriend to this facility so she can receive the best of care at the end of her life\"\n\nHe of course won't likely take it well but as you have said OP your brother has burnt or near burnt your bridges before and this is just another scenario that may entirely burn it to the ground but he is sadly taking advantage of you and you need to do what is best for yourself and your wife", "NTA, they have options but would rather mooch off of you instead. Brother didn\u2019t need to quit his job. They also ignore their kid, should probably call the social worker or something.

Especially if its free.  Your brother isn't qualified to provide that.  \n\nEnd of the day, it is family, and family is everything.  But with people like your brother, you either teach them to grow up and behave like an adult, or you accept the burden of being the adult and you make the decisions.
