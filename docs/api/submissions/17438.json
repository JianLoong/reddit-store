If he refuses to sign the papers, then it's time to consider a proper eviction because you can't financially and emotionally deal with this anymore.

Would you be willing to allow your brother to stay though if his girlfriend went to the hospital for palliative care? That way he can still focus on her and your niece keeps a roof over her head? \nDoes the girlfriend have no family? I imagine they both are consumed as anyone would be but you\u2019ve been put in a very unfair position. Nta. I\u2019m very sorry for your brother and his gf and for the difficult position you\u2019re in.", "Are you in the US?  How long has she been ill why hasn't she applied for disability?  \n\nI think there are NAH.  I've seen state run facilities and they don't look great.  But how much better is it to die in your house and at least she will have staff to take the burden off your brother (this is how I would sell it)\n\nAlso why doesn't she have any family?", "NTA but don\u2019t offer th papers, just let him know you can\u2019t continue to support them and he needs another plan.", "NAH. You're all in a tragic situation, and in this case everyone is doing what they think is right. I agree with others who commented it would depend how long she has left and what her medical care needs are.", "NTA. He\u2019s sponging off you.\n\nThe thing about palliative care being provided is something that should have been found well before now(like around the time he moved in?)\n\nAlso, it\u2019s child abuse to not provide a reasonable education for your child\u2026 so keep that in mind about the niece. \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s really all that able to take care of family,  and it\u2019s *really* not your place to do so- you\u2019ve already gone above and beyond. \n\nThe reality is, if you don\u2019t take care of yourself, you can\u2019t take care of others. This isn\u2019t being selfish. This is being responsible.", "NTA His GF needs to be in hospice care. He can visit her daily.\n\nHow do you feel about letting your niece stay with you on the grounds she start attending school? Because honestly, she's being neglected by your brother. And this situation is your brother's doing, not hers.", "Honestly, I want to say on and off for about 5 years, but that possibly they have been friends for much longer than that. I recall meeting her a long long time ago at a New Years party (perhaps 8 or so years ago) and she was his date. However, during his years of couch surfing, he's had a great number of flings and \"roomies\"\n\nMy brother has always had an extremely intricate and complicated social network which is how he kept up with his lifestyle for so long. It's just sad because the last little while, prior to her diagnosis, he seemed to be doing better for himself. \n\nNo, his girlfriend is not the mother of his kid, and I don't actually feel like baby mama wants to be in the picture at all as I haven't heard her be mentioned once this past year.", "This depends on the country and in the US depends on what kind of insurance she has, and most everything except medicaid will only pay for something like 15 hours a week.", "We are not in the US, and health care is free. Palliative paperwork would just make all the \"extras\" that aren't covered by typical healthcare 100% free. \n\nI honestly haven't talked much with my brother about his finances, just because I felt like it wasn't my place to do so. I am also used to footing the bill for him, so it never really occurred to me to ask all the details. \n\nAs for her...Yes, she has family. I can hear them facetiming with her sometimes, but I don't know where or who they are. So far no one has come to my door asking to see her, so I don't know if the relationship she has with them is strained, like that of mine and my brothers, or if they are just too far away.", "I do get mad at him often over the suspicion that he is \"sponging off me.\" Though, I keep reminding myself that I may be basing that off of  the history we have. \n\nOf course he will always be my brother, but he has hurt me a great number of times in the past, and so this time almost feels much more burdensome. It's almost as if I'm in a \"boy who cried wolf\" scenario, expect this time there's actually a wolf that needs dealing with but I'm just so so tired of picking up pieces. It's hard. I see and sense his grief and his position, but I see he's starting to flounder again and take the easy way. \n\nI suppose I just wanted the advice from strangers to make sure my resentment for my brother isn't causing me to make heartless decisions in his time of vulnerability. He is still my brother, he always will be  - so will my niece. But I also want to be there for my wife and to have us on our way to starting our own family.", "Weird. Of everything here, I feel like his daughter not going to school is the biggest \"problem behavior\" to me. I guess she can just repeat a year, but getting split up from your friends is kind of a big deal at that age. I guess it kinda depends what she's doing. Is she spending time with the gf or is she just kinda sitting around doing nothing?\n\nI don't think it's wrong for you to not want these people in your house, especially since your brother is not helping financially and there is a free option for them. However, I also see where your brother is coming from. He probably knows he'd regret it for the rest of his life if he didn't spend every possible second he could with her, and he's probably willing to screw you/your wife over to do it, and I honestly can't blame him for that. In the past, he would be out of work because of laziness/whatever, but now he actually has a pretty good reason to not want to find a job and I think you should respect that.\n\nNot sure what the palliative care options are, but there are legitimate reasons not to want that. Even if it's not their home, it is a home setting and that is going to be a lot more comfortable potentially. \n\nI'm gonna go with a NAH. It's a shitty, tragic situation all around that he finally seemed to be getting his life together and then this happened.\n\nPersonally, if I were you, I would make the decision based on how much time the gf has left. If it's a matter of 1-2 months, suck it up, it's not worth the rift and the conflict between you and your brother at a time when he really doesn't need it. If it's going to be significantly longer than that, then I definitely understand you wanting to force the issue but you will probably get a lot of backlash. If money is becoming an issue, maybe ask your parents for money?", "Is there a reason you all cannot ask about her family?  She may feel like she would be a burden to her brother to move her but she would probably be more comfortable with them and I'm sure a pending death would smooth over a lot of ruffled feathers if there are any.", "This is gonna be a little outta left field and may also be a bit of projection on my part, I apologize for that, but has your brother ever been tested for ADHD? A lot of what you said about his life before this situation (not keeping a steady job/relationship)  as well as this sentence \n\n> but I see he's starting to flounder again and take the easy way\n\ngave me that kind of impression Probably not the best time to look into it now with everything going on but at some point down the line that could be an avenue for him to look into."]}
