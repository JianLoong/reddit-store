Around May last year my mother (F53)started seeing Mark(M50), I(F16) never liked him as he came not even two months after my father left. due to the lack of time to adjust I kept my distance.

I have mental health issue and social anxiety so the only things I\u2019ve been doing has been attending school, and doing the chores my mother gave me as that\u2019s all I am able to do everyday. Mark for some reason really wanted me to be an replacement daughter for him, since his biological daughter wouldn\u2019t talk to him. I\u2019ve always turned down his attempts.

A grown man should not be screaming at a 16 year old and obviously nobody is going to want to foster a relationship when he is high or drunk and abusive to your mother.

As soon as you're able to. He sounds abusive and since your mom won't leave, you should leave when you can.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to get your mother to agree to call the police before something awful happens.

My mom had a boyfriend who was like this, and would also do a whole lot of dumb shit. But they fought all the time. I was in college at this time and would stay at my boyfriend's house to avoid it all. One time I went home and I saw my brother downstairs with his gun looking like he was about to storm upstairs. I heard the screaming and knew why. Luckily it didn't get bad and nothing happened and eventually she threw that ass out. It took months of my brother and mom fighting about it and me just not being around and ultimatums being thrown down in order for it to happen though.  \n\nThis is so much stress on you and it will be hard to get your mom to wake up and realize she needs to get out of this environment. I'm so sorry. It's easy to say, \"talk to her and explain your situation,\" but that only works if she's willing to listen. Unfortunately I don't know how to help you, but I think you're awesome and badass for standing up for you and your mother. If you can get through to her, convince her to dump him and get you guys out. Stay strong. I hope things turn out well for you.", "NTA. Your mom was vulnerable and recently single. He is using that to get into and stay in her life. \n\nPlease stay safe. Also do you have any aunts or uncles or adults you trust to speak to? Find someone safe to talk to and potentially finding a different place to live for a bit. Also see if someone can speak to her mom and help her escape his orbit.", "And you called the police to report the threats and his drunken driving, right?\n\nNTA but make a plan and get out of there for your safety if your mother won\u2019t get it together.", "Mom clearly has issues and she is in a DV situation. Doesn't seem like she will grow a backbone any time soon- or even if she does, she and her daughter are safe.\n\nOP, GET OUT AND AWAY. You are not safe here. If your mom is making apologies for this clearly dangerous man, you cannot count on her. Talk to your school or any other trustworthy adult in your life.\n\nThis entire sub is rooting for you- please get out.\n\nNTA.", "My thoughts exactly. OP NTA, and if you have any family nearby, ask them to take your in. Besides being violent this man gives off very weird vibes (and his daughter def doesn't speak to him for a reason!). It's not your job to save your mother, but as your mother doesn't seem to be good in her job of saving you, you have to save yourself. GTFO."]}
