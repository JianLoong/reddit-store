He NEVER EVER EVER uses money on himself, and always says he wants to save up to ensure he can give me a good life. that's why his behavior was unusual/weird to me.\n\n i wanted an opinion based on this one specific thing, and i think it's a bit unfair of people to imagine the worst of him when he has done nothing of the like prior. i would like to reiterate that me \"keeping track\" (i don't see it as keeping track but more being responsible) of the cost of his gifts is something i do in respect to HIS wishes that i don't overspend or go overboard with gifts (which i used to do at the start of our relationship, so i see his point, especially since we're saving up to help my family repair their house). i was just unsure whether me buying tickets for a band he disliked was wrong, even though i did offer to make up for it on the day of.", "created_utc": 1679756816, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121osaf/aita_for_disappointing_my_husband_on_his_bday/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
