Everyone is in a hurry\u2026they just think they are more important than everyone else.", "NTA\n\nThis is why you should always give yourself more time than you think you need when catching a flight.  You did the right thing and if she didn't bother to plan accordingly then that's on her.  By pushing in she could have caused other people to miss their flights if security was slow that day.", "NTA. I always get to the airport 2-3 hours in advance of when my flight leaves--I budget extra time just in case the security line is ridiculously long. It's not your fault she didn't plan ahead.", "NTA\n\nIt's on people to plan ahead and if people think a sob story about missing a flight can get them to the front of the security line, there are some people who will *never* wait in line.", "NTA.  She should have gotten to the airport sooner", "NTA, and this is why we all have to get to the airport EARLY. I have never regretted getting to an airport earlier than necessary, but I have regretted getting there \u201con time.\u201d", "NTA. Poor planning on her part doesn\u2019t mean you need to let her through. \n\nHowever if the people in charge of security were giving priority to people on certain flights leaving soon, then that would be entirely different", "If you were in the potential same boat of missing your flight, then NTA. Sound stressful, but like you said, everyone has a responsibility of getting to the airport on time.", "NAH; it's really something the line security should've handled. That's what I've seen happen in the past; they show their pass/ticket to the staff monitoring the line, and they give the okay for the person to skip ahead.", "NTA.  I had something similar where a person shoved their way to be the first one off the plane.  They kept saying, sorry I am going to miss my connection.

Seemed very entitled, but I had like an hour before my next flight so I wasn\u2019t that worried myself.  \n\nTurned out they were on my next flight.  We sat and waited at the gate and that flight was even delayed.   So much for that emergency need to be first.", "NTA.

We have a saying at work that, \"Your poor planning does not constitute my emergency.\" \n\nI think that applies here. \n\nHer lack of planning to get there early enough to account for delays, does not mean everyone else should just jump out of her way.", "NTA, this reminds me while I was driving it was drizzling. There was quite a bit of traffic but we were steadily moving at 35 mph. I see this car a few cars behind me flashing high beams to get the to move out of the lane. I don't know why people were moving out of the way as no one was going slow on purpose in the fast lane. She got to me I would move over, she started to honk but I still wouldn't move driving with the flow of traffic. I see her giving me the finger so I stuck my hand out and gave it back to her.  Like we are all in the same situation what makes you special that we have to move out of the way for you.", "If there is a delay caused by airport security, probably TSA, I would think the airlines would delay the flights until people clear security.", "NTA\n\nI swear, no one knows how to behave in public anymore. \n\n>Plus, I do feel like a part of airport travel is making sure you get there in time for contingencies. \n\n\nYes, it.

When did crying in public become so acceptable?", "NTA, entitled young people need to learn that lack of planning on their part doesn't mean an emergency on anyone else's part. Crying on the phone for sympathy doesn't make her right.", "NTA. The kindest interpretation of her entitled behavior is that she panicked. But she still needed a dose of reality.", "NTA - she needed somebody to remind her that, despite how she felt, she is in fact NOT the main character in everyone else\u2019s story.", "YTA it would cost you $0 and maybe 15 seconds of your time to let her through. I could see saying no to anyone else that asked after obviously. I fly 2x a week for work and I\u2019ll let anyone go ahead of me if they\u2019re clearly stressed and about to miss their flight. Spread a little kindness and compassion in the world when possible.", "My airport is a Delta hub, so I usually wind up flying them.  If there are delays making me late, I find a Delta employee and ask them to help.  They can stick you in line if they need to.", "NTA\n\nBTW you need to TSA pre check, clear just lets you skip showing your ID. Best is to have global entry which include TSA pre and quick entry back into the U.S. Clear is of dubious usefulness.", "What is a TSA clear check?", "No.\n\nDid she miss her flight?", "YTA, but only slightly. I get what you\u2019re saying. \n\nBut wow people are so harsh on here. It\u2019s stressful enough to travel, and having been in a similar situation, I am SO SO SO grateful at everyone who let me through- I made my flight by one minute - literally one minute. So every person who said yes made a huge difference. Should I have gone to the airport 3 hours early? I will now! But I didn\u2019t go only 90 min before my flight thinking \u201chahaha I\u2019ll skip all those losers in line\u201d. I thought \u201c90 mins should be enough time\u201d and then panicked at an unusual line. Why do we assume this person is an entitled brat? \n\nI\u2019m not saying OP is a hugeTA; I\u2019m saying that a little compassion is warranted, and if it\u2019s not going to make you late for your flight, the \u201cif everyone did this we\u2019d all be late\u201d is BS. Everyone isn\u2019t doing it. This one person who needs it is. And you\u2019re saying no because you want to teach them a lesson or something? Most people would rather dig a hole than beg passengers to go ahead in a TSA line. Trust me.", "INFO\n\nWas this in New York? If so your weather was nuts and my understanding is that even if someone left well in advance the road and subway closures might have made them late. Add the fact that people sometimes get bumped to a different airport and the situation is not something that I'd expect any passanger to be able to plan for. \n\nThat said, the proper way for the woman to have handled it would have been to approach airport staff and see if they would let her cut the line, but she may not have known that. \n\n\nTBH if it was New York then I'm kinda leaning towards TSA was TA for moving your line around so much and not intervening when it was clear that doing so was going to cause people to miss their flights.
