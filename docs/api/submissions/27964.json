You did the right thing and if she didn't bother to plan accordingly then that's on her.  By pushing in she could have caused other people to miss their flights if security was slow that day.", "NTA. I always get to the airport 2-3 hours in advance of when my flight leaves--I budget extra time just in case the security line is ridiculously long. It's not your fault she didn't plan ahead.", "NTA\n\nIt's on people to plan ahead and if people think a sob story about missing a flight can get them to the front of the security line, there are some people who will *never* wait in line.", "NTA.  She should have gotten to the airport sooner", "NTA, and this is why we all have to get to the airport EARLY.

We sat and waited at the gate and that flight was even delayed.   So much for that emergency need to be first.", "NTA.

There was quite a bit of traffic but we were steadily moving at 35 mph. I see this car a few cars behind me flashing high beams to get the to move out of the lane. I don't know why people were moving out of the way as no one was going slow on purpose in the fast lane. She got to me I would move over, she started to honk but I still wouldn't move driving with the flow of traffic. I see her giving me the finger so I stuck my hand out and gave it back to her.

When did crying in public become so acceptable?", "NTA, entitled young people need to learn that lack of planning on their part doesn't mean an emergency on anyone else's part.

Spread a little kindness and compassion in the world when possible.", "My airport is a Delta hub, so I usually wind up flying them.  If there are delays making me late, I find a Delta employee and ask them to help.  They can stick you in line if they need to.", "NTA\n\nBTW you need to TSA pre check, clear just lets you skip showing your ID. Best is to have global entry which include TSA pre and quick entry back into the U.S. Clear is of dubious usefulness.", "What is a TSA clear check?", "No.\n\nDid she miss her flight?", "YTA, but only slightly. I get what you\u2019re saying. \n\nBut wow people are so harsh on here. It\u2019s stressful enough to travel, and having been in a similar situation, I am SO SO SO grateful at everyone who let me through- I made my flight by one minute - literally one minute. So every person who said yes made a huge difference. Should I have gone to the airport 3 hours early? I will now! But I didn\u2019t go only 90 min before my flight thinking \u201chahaha I\u2019ll skip all those losers in line\u201d. I thought \u201c90 mins should be enough time\u201d and then panicked at an unusual line. Why do we assume this person is an entitled brat? \n\nI\u2019m not saying OP is a hugeTA; I\u2019m saying that a little compassion is warranted, and if it\u2019s not going to make you late for your flight, the \u201cif everyone did this we\u2019d all be late\u201d is BS. Everyone isn\u2019t doing it. This one person who needs it is. And you\u2019re saying no because you want to teach them a lesson or something? Most people would rather dig a hole than beg passengers to go ahead in a TSA line. Trust me.", "INFO\n\nWas this in New York? If so your weather was nuts and my understanding is that even if someone left well in advance the road and subway closures might have made them late. Add the fact that people sometimes get bumped to a different airport and the situation is not something that I'd expect any passanger to be able to plan for. \n\nThat said, the proper way for the woman to have handled it would have been to approach airport staff and see if they would let her cut the line, but she may not have known that. \n\n\nTBH if it was New York then I'm kinda leaning towards TSA was TA for moving your line around so much and not intervening when it was clear that doing so was going to cause people to miss their flights.

This is why people are instructed to get to the airport approximately two hours ahead of the flight time. I find it\u2019s rarely needed but I find it hard to feel sympathy for people who show up less than an hour before their flight who don\u2019t have PreCheck or first class tickets and expect to make their flights.", "NTA.  I travel a few times a year and get to the airport at least two hours early, three hours early if flying international.  I don't care how hard the person is crying behind me, you're not skating up to the front because you're in a time crunch.  You can't count on TSA being fast, or the line at the check in being fast or the line to drop off baggage being fast. I expect them all to be slow and that's generally how it plays out. I have TSA pre-check but that doesn't help with the kiosks or baggage check in.  Flying is guaranteed aggravation and lines so you've got to wait your turn just like everyone else.", "YTA. I recently almost missed an international flight. We had got to the airport 3 hours ahead of departure, they had some issues with the checkin computers so I ended up having to barge through security. If people had blocked me from skipping I would definitely have missed it and lost a days travel.", "NAH. She asked, you said no. She didn't cause a disturbance to the point she had to be ejected and just vented because she was frustrated.", "NTA\n\nI would rather leave early and sit at the gate for two hours with nothing to do than worry about missing my flight. I get that things happen but her lack of planning is not your emergency.", "NTA. Poor planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on yours.", "You are 100% an AH !", "I\u2019m a cynic when it comes to tears. I have 8 sisters and they could all cry on demand and make it look real. In a situation like you described I would not believe her. You are NTA", "NTA at all. I use Orlando IA and the security lines are horrible. A whole family came barreling through on one occasion. I don't know where tf TSA is when this crap happens. Because fights have started for way less.", "NTA", "wow where do you live where the TSA line is over an hour and they aren't patrolling the line? \n\nHas to be PDX or LAX \ud83d\ude04", "What is TSA pre check?", "NTA I fly about one a month due to weather previously 3 days before my flight many flights were cancelled out of FFL the line was outside the door of the airport. I paid someone 80 dollars to get me to the front of the line. I\u2019m all for cash compensation. Money talks.", "Lol NTA and \n\n>And yes, I know ITA for not getting my TSA clear check\n\nNo you're not. Stop stressing, the airport is a public commodity you have a right to use it too.", "YTA this is so fucked up lol. \n\nWhen I was younger this wasn\u2019t a problem. Used to happen all the time. \n\nI usually barf at the \u201cppl didn\u2019t used to be so mean\u201d shtick. Ppl have always been assholes. \n\nBut this post and comment section is disheartening. \n\nImagine a world where you could count on a crowd of strangers to help you out.", "She probably almost missed her flight because she made the decision to be late. Fuck her she\u2019s an asshole. You always make your flight if you show up early enough. Simple.", "NTA, as someone that traveled for work, I made it a personal rule that I would be at the airport a minimum two hours before my flight.  I would rather wait forever at security then sit at the gate totally board over sprinting through the airport only to miss my flight.", "So, you say a part of traveling is planning for contingencies while at the same time acknowledging that you had the extra time because you just happened to be ready early. Not because of careful planning. \n\nEveryone deserves a little grace now and then. You don\u2019t know where she was going or why she was going there or why she wasn\u2019t also lucky enough to have been accidentally ready 20 minutes early. \n\nIMO, you\u2019re NTA here but also not NTA.", "NTA.\n\nI flew from an airport in the UK a few weeks ago and the security line was really long.  So a member of staff was walking down the line plucking people out of it who had a flight in less than 45 minutes.\n\nShe should have found a member of staff to help her instead of trying to push in", "I fly out of Orlando Florida. Sometimes it takes several hours just to get up to the airport drop off once you are at the airport. Sometimes security take several hours. Sometimes both. And with all the kids traveling to the mouse it gets hostile fast. Nobody wants to miss a flight but it happens way too often. Nobody is allowed to cut the line unless they\u2019re escorted in a wheelchair. NTA", "I fly out of Orlando Florida.

To me, how early you get to the airport is part of how important the flight is to you.

I show up at the airport at least 6-8 months before my flight, just In case something happens and I won't miss my flight", "Yep, I'm happy to sit and read my book. I'd rather be there early and avoid the stress.", "This.. when I was on a business trip in Dehli a few years ago on my way back to Europe there was a local man who was late and he tried to politely ask everyone in line if he could pass. I let him through as I had some hours to my flight, but one of the men in front of me did not let him pass. In the typical Indian humble fashion he apologized for even asking and I could see he was very worried. He showed me his ticket and it was very close to boarding time and there was no chance if he had to wait, so I just asked one of the security personnel over who were making sure the queues were ok, and asked them politely to take this man to the front, so he can get checked and possibly make his flight. \nThat person also checked his ticket, asked the man to follow her and walked with him all the way to the front so he could get checked.\n\nI really hope he made his flight.\nI think it\u2019s ok to ask security if they\u2019re willing to help, but it\u2019s their decision.\nDon\u2019t go around asking strangers (there will be people denying you), but get the personnel involved for assistance if you\u2019re really that close to missing your flight.", "OP said they pushed their way from the back of the line, they were late, not OP or anyone else's issue.", "That is good info, thanks.", "Next time you'll show up earlier.", "(She didn\u2019t actually ask, she was kind of elbowing people aside and yelling \u201cI need to get through! Let me through! I am going to miss my flight!\u201d)", "My relative has awful issues getting to the airport on time. If she's late, she has been known to fake an injury and get wheeled on to the plane in a wheelchair. She is known family-wide as missing planes frequently, and ramping up the drama. With international flights, no less.\n\nFound out she is not only tardy, but a really poor planner. Last time she came over for a family funeral (before Covid) she came up all panicked and said she needed underwear to wear a pant suit to the funeral. I, thinking she overlooked packing extra undies,  told her we had enough time to wash and dry her panties before the funeral. She said she didn't have any at all, I asked what she was wearing on the flight the day before. She said she was wearing a skirt, so hadn't needed to put panties on.\n\nShe was traveling international with no underpants. Wearing a skirt.", "Where are you from?", "Same. I usually have at least an extra hour at the airport and plenty of time to chill out at the gate. \n\nOne of the worst things today is that I didn\u2019t even have time to stop for a bottle of water! I was in the security line for almost 90 minutes. I didn\u2019t have anything to drink in line because I would have to toss it anyway (didn\u2019t realize in advance that I would have enough time to suck down a Big Gulp). Then when I finally got though security  I was hurrying to get on the plane. I was hoping for a minute at the gate. But no.  \n\nI know it doesn\u2019t sound like a major tragedy, but due to cancer treatment in the past, my mouth gets really dry, really quickly. It is terribly unpleasant if I can\u2019t have a drink.  So that added to the frustration of the experience.", "> I show up at the airport at least 6-8 months before my flight\n\n6 to 8 months early? I mean I'm all for being there early but isn't that a bit much? LOL", "Agree! I\u2019ve arrived before the airport has even opened in some smaller places!! Then I spend 4 hours checking every 5 mins that my passport hasn\u2019t miraculously unzipped 3 pockets & jumped out for an adventure. And this is with a handful of Valium", "I don't think she has a problem with drawing attention to herself lol nta", "Oh. Totally NTA then. I can understand a mininfreakout and going on a bitchfest with her friends, but yeah forcing her way through is definitely A-Hole material.", "CDG and ORD are the two worst airports I\u2019ve been through.  \n\nThe new IST isn\u2019t far behind, merely because of horrible planning.  \u201cWalk that way for 2 miles.\u201d", "If you mention a medical need for hydration to the flight attendants, they can usually get you something, unless the plane is already set for takeoff and they have to sit down.", "Have you tried Pilocarpine or others meds that increase saliva production. ?ACT makes a wonderful OTC peppermint gum that also helps .", "Yeah, that's the main reason you're NTA here -- everyone was in that situation and it wouldn't have been fair to let one person through with no known outstanding circumstances. She may not be an asshole, just a freaked out person in circumstances beyond her control, but letting one person cut in that situation would have led to total chaos.

My husband just came back from Japan. Once they got to Atlanta he had to go through customs and get his bags. Then go through security again to catch his domestic flight.", "When you re-enter the US, you go through security and immigration at your point of entry.  If you\u2019re flying from NY to Sydney and switching planes in Beijing, you only have to go through security and customs in China if you leave the airport.  If you change planes in Abu Dhabi, you go through security both before and after boarding the plane, and that is in addition to customs and immigration you go through before leaving the airport.  Every country/airport has its own policies and procedures.  The above might not even be current, but it was my experience traveling pre-Covid.  Last year, we didn\u2019t have to go through security switching planes once we entered the Schengen Zone.", "Gross"]}
