Bills are divided by money earned because you pay them with money. Chores are \u201cpaid\u201d for with time.

Good luck communicating how serious of an issue this can become for your marriage. I mean that sincerely - if he\u2019s so lazy and entitled he may not be able to understand how serious this is.", "NTA. My husband\u2019s salary is about 2.5x mine.

Even though it\u2019s not more often, it\u2019s been a huge help.", "NTA....A marriage is a partnership that requires lots of sacrifice. Your husband should be putting forth more of an effort to carry his weight. Who gives a fuck who makes more money?", "NTA. It's fair to contribute money according to your incomes for the same hours of work. It is, however, not fair to divide household chores according to income. \n\nHim having a better paying job doesn't make him more important. It might make him someone who can hire a housekeeper, though.", "NTA\n\nYou both work the same hours and are tired. He doesn\u2019t get a pass because he gets paid more. He should WANT to share that with you, or why get married? \n\nThere will be times during your marriage where people earn more than others, or someone gets sick, or maybe someone stays home with children. The other person should happily share their money to help the family get by.

Also, consider if you want to deal with this forever", "It sounds like you're both working equally hard and roughly the same amount. The fact he makes more doesn't factor into it. NTA.

Every time i see these posts people give a break down on who contributes more money. If you are both working the same hours then the money is irrelevant. If one of you looks after kids full time then the money is irrelevant. He needs to adult better", "Absolutely NTA but he is not valuing you as an equal partner - he's starting to treat you like a maid. You're not a SAHW and it doesn't sound like you want to be - he needs to sort out his attitude and you both need to find a way forward domestically which works for you. \n\nIf money is his answer, could you hire someone to help with the housework and keep on top of it? But I think the actual labour here isn't the problem - it's his changing attitude that he is entitled to treat you like his staff.", "NTA. What in the patriarchal fuck. This asshat needs to be assigned the metafilter thread on emotional labor immediately.", "NTA\n\nIf he doesn't want to help out with the household then he should take his buckets of cash and hire someone to do his share of the tasks!", "NTA. The dollar amount of money that one contributes to the household should not factor into the division of household labor. The number of hours someone spends working? Sure, that should be considered. But just because he makes more money, he should do less housework? Nah, fuck that noise.", "NTA. He should be paying for everything if that\u2019s his expectation. And you would have to agree to the dynamic. Tell him to hire a maid and cook, because you\u2019re not his. \n\nHonestly it doesn\u2019t even sound like you contribute significantly less than he does financially anyway. With how much more he makes, he should be paying more than he is now, on top of stepping up at home.", "NTA - You\u2019ve said you\u2019re actively trying to advance your career whilst studying and he doesn\u2019t seem supportive of that.

I am willing to bet you won\u2019t agree to this.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t do nothing obviously.

I live alone mostly in a house. My gf visits but i do all the chores. Doing laundry literally only takes maybe 10 minutes total. I don't understand what is there so much to clean. Or are people just living so dirty. Dishwasher washes the dishes, robot cleans the floor, robot also mows the lawn. Once a week wash the floor. Cooking takes minimal time because most of the time food is just cooking on the stove. Usually when people say \"i spent an hour on cooking\", what they mean is that they spent 10 minutes on prepping ingredients and 50min was idle when food was on the stove. And cooking isn't a chore. I've always cooked in every relationship and never seen it as a chore. My girlfriends have sometimes helped with the dishes. Are people just living really dirty or am i missing something. I even WFH. All my rooms are clean.", "NTA. Though also, is hard to imagine a situation where 1X (where X = the wage for an 8-5 job) + 6X  doesn't leave you comfortably off enough to get a cleaner.

We find this easiest by having a joint account where our salary's go to. And thats where all bills and things we do together come out of.

One of the commenter says he wouldn\u2019t pick up the chores again easily in the fall, and honestly I think the chances of that are very high. I would personally let them settle into a routine this year and then next year take on more in the summer. I dislike the idea of disrupting things when they finally are starting to be more equal.", "I didn't see this post but it depends on how they split the chores the rest or the year and how different of similar their work schedule/charge is.\n\nMy ex partner and I had similar jobs with similar schedules overall, but at times we had bigger projects and deadlines that meant longer work days. If she was under a lot of stress and spent longer at work I would naturally take over a lit of her house chores. Same thing if the situation was reversed. And if both of us were going through the grinder it stayed 50/50. When she switched jobs and had a 2-months gap she went on a nice vacation but the rest of the time she did most of the chores; we didn't even discuss it, it just seemed obvious to us.\n\nSo if the chores are split fairly throughout the year, I'd say it's fair to expect for it to adapt during non-shared time off.", "Definitely get a cleaner, but contribute equally to the cost.", "He makes 6X what she does and refuses to do his share of the household work. If he wants a maid he can damn well pay a professional.", "Hmmm... I've been taken advantage of in this area of my life in the past, earning more and doing more chores also.

Costs should be shared based on income in a partnership. He earns 6x as much as her but contributes half as much in terms of percentage of income. It's already inequitable despite him contributing more in total $.

You should both have equal relaxation time.  You're his wife, not his paid housekeeper.", "NTA OP.", "NTA - The only time that \"one earns the most so they do the least in the house\" is when one person is 100% unemployed and the other is the breadwinner....and even then, it's still fine for the unemployed person to ask for help in the chores sometimes.", "NTA but the solution here is for him to just use his extra income to pay for extra cleaning help.", "NTA, but you need to stop cooking, cleaning the house, and doing laundry.  Once you sit down with your husband and he's agreed to split the chores, you can start doing these things again.  Until then, stop.  The fact of the matter is that given that you are prepping for an exam, he should be doing what he can to give you more time to study.\n\nThe other thing you can do is outsource the work.

You\u2019re a team, and right now, you\u2019re in a team of one. You need help, you\u2019re exhausted and drowning, and your husband won\u2019t help you. Teams don\u2019t function like that. And when you\u2019re a team, you\u2019re financially a team, too. He makes 6x more than you. Of course you can\u2019t meet his household contributions. It\u2019s not possible. Currently, he has things pretty jammy. You\u2019re his live-in maid with benefits, but not his equal. He needs to seriously re-think his stance, and maybe you should re-think what you\u2018ve gotten in to. And here\u2019s the thing. I assume that by studying, this will help you land better jobs, leading to larger paycheques. That benefits you both. \n\nThat said, stop doing his laundry, ironing, any of that. Don\u2019t make lunches or breakfast for him. Do the things you must, but not one bit more. This situation as it sits cannot continue.", "NTA. How much he pays has nothing to do with housework. You\u2019re there the same amount of time he needs to do 50% of the housework. I would talk to him again, explain to him exactly how you feel and why. Again let him know he\u2019s responsible for half of the household chores. If he still refuses, start cooking extra so there\u2019s leftovers and when you\u2019re too tired, eat the leftovers and let him know he can do the same or cook and clean up after himself. Cut the corners where you can. Only do your laundry. Let him do his own. Things like this that saves you time for yourself. Good luck on the exam!", "NTA.  I eprsonally think you can try and apply numbers to this stuff.  In your case it's not equal.\n\n1.  If he makes 6x he should pay 6x more.  Why does he only pay 3x more.\n2.  Calculate house chores by time and don't factor in salary.", "Get a cleaner/housekeeper. Why not get help when you need it? It sounds like it\u2019s affordable for you.\n\nThe thing is, if he is earning a high salary then he probably does need to work at night reviewing things etc, in the same way you need to study. These things are both important and time consuming.", "Yep.", "OP do you realize that there are some relationships where 1 person\u2019s only contribution is companionship, connection and emotional support? It is possible for 1 person to happily financially support the other in that situation and consider that the relationship is equal.", "Financial bullying is totally a thing.", "But you picked right back up.

He still lives there equally. So he should hire a housekeeper since you both are very busy people. And the you can cook for yourself, with the occasional joint meal. Less burn out, more of a win.", "Question for OP because its not clear from info posted: what % of total household expenses are you paying for?  If its more than 1/6 (since he makes 6x what you make) then hubby is taking financial advantage of you on top of him not pulling his weight on household chores.  Just from your post it feels like he knows this and doesnt want to give it up.  You are NTA. Why should his income level dictate how much chores he is responsible for? You are both working the same # of hours.", "NTA. For me it sounds like he's trying to sabotage your studies. Maybe he enjoys the power imbalance which came with you earning less? And is afraid to lose it should you be successful. \n\nAs anyone else I think if you're both working the same amount of time you both need to do the same amount of household", "NTA.

Without knowing the specifics of both your jobs, just because he earns more doesn't mean he works harder than you.\n\nThe fact you both work the same hours and seem to be equally tired at the end of day indicates you should be splitting the household chores equally.\n\nHe obviously has the capability to contribute more financially, which he should, but only you would be aware what the actual differentiation is in terms of effort put into everyday work, and this should be reflected in the split of household chores.", "NTA. He thinks he\u2019s too important to do housework because he makes a lot of money. Shut it down. Let him find out how many chores he\u2019d be doing if he lived alone.", "NTA. And I'm sorry, but your husband is truly awful.", "NTA   I don't get this.  He lives there too.   Tell you what, just don't cook for him.  Don't do his laundry.  Don't clean up after him.

She was in nursing school and instead of helping out more (really at all) my BIL was mad she didn\u2019t do as much housework as usual. I\u2019m still mad at him.", "My husband and I used to fight over household chores as well. Our solution was to examine what needs to be done in a way we are both comfortable with. We now have a list of household chores which specifies the chores, expected result when done, time line as in what internervals and time the chore should be done and last but not least whos task it is. Moreover we are rotating tasks so that one isn't stuck with an unloved one all the time.\nThis way we can objectivize the topic without making it overly emotional. We are doing this for more than 6 years now. \nWe split the household work 50/50 taking the time and effort of the specific task into account. \nWe are both working 40h/week and I make about 1/3 more than he does.\n\nOP you are NTA. Your husband needs to put his big boy pants on and do his equal share of household chores.

I see comments from people saying this is a partner ship. Well in partnerships each person contributes equally. He\u2019s making a 6X financial  contribution to your income. You\u2019re not equal. I agree with your husband. If he\u2019s bringing more into the house you have to or should make up the difference In another way. Hire a cleaner? Maybe suggest that you become a stay at home house wife or get a part time job. I mean why do you even have to work if he\u2019s making 6X more than you, do you guys need your income to survive. Are you guys planning on having kids if you don\u2019t already. Do you think it\u2019s the best environment to have kids with both of you working out of the house all day and to tired to potentially take care of future kids and cleaning and cooking. Maybe have a sit down with your husband I don\u2019t think demanding him do more house work is an answer. If your not happy maybe separate.", "Look at individuals\n\nUsually cheaper", "Yep. I do most of the chores and for a long time was the only person who brought in money because my partner is disabled. They finally got their VA disability so they can contribute some financially, and they use some of that to pay for a cleaner so I don\u2019t have to do everything. I still do more financially and housework but it\u2019s easier. At no time did I consider them the lesser partner because they support my emotionally and enrich my life, and I always knew they were doing as much as they could and always looking for ways to ease my burdens.", "How\u2019s he financially bullying her by stating he contributes far more to the household than her? What\u2019s stopping the OP from hiring a cleaner to help out with house work if she\u2019s so tired?", "Sharing the cost evenly is financial bullying bordering on abuse. The issue is that splitting costs evenly puts much much more of a burden on her than on him for no good reason at all"]}
