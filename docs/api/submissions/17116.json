This is a marriage. Forget who earns how much and who pays for what. It's not a mathematical problem; this is a partnership in which\n\n>We both work 8-5 jobs\n\nand\n\n>Both of us are equally tired after work.\n\nThey are the things that matter here and he needs to listen to you.", "Taking care of your home isn\u2019t divided by money earned but by time available. Bills are divided by money earned because you pay them with money. Chores are \u201cpaid\u201d for with time. He needs to step up. \n\nAnd if he doesn\u2019t then you need to see that he devalues you and tbh you\u2019d have less to do taking care of a single person household. \n\nAbsolutely NTA. Good luck communicating how serious of an issue this can become for your marriage. I mean that sincerely - if he\u2019s so lazy and entitled he may not be able to understand how serious this is.", "NTA. My husband\u2019s salary is about 2.5x mine. I told him that if he doesn\u2019t want to do equal chores with me, he has to pay someone else to do it. We have a housekeeper come once a month now. Even though it\u2019s not more often, it\u2019s been a huge help.", "NTA....A marriage is a partnership that requires lots of sacrifice. Your husband should be putting forth more of an effort to carry his weight. Who gives a fuck who makes more money?", "NTA. It's fair to contribute money according to your incomes for the same hours of work. It is, however, not fair to divide household chores according to income. \n\nHim having a better paying job doesn't make him more important. It might make him someone who can hire a housekeeper, though.", "NTA\n\nYou both work the same hours and are tired. He doesn\u2019t get a pass because he gets paid more. He should WANT to share that with you, or why get married? \n\nThere will be times during your marriage where people earn more than others, or someone gets sick, or maybe someone stays home with children. The other person should happily share their money to help the family get by. I would be concerned that the financial control he has could escalate in one of these situations.\n\nTell him to shut up and help, or use all his fancy money to pay for a cleaner. Also, consider if you want to deal with this forever", "It sounds like you're both working equally hard and roughly the same amount. The fact he makes more doesn't factor into it. NTA. He can hire someone to help clean and order takeout more on his dime if he'd rather do that then help physically.", "NTA. Every time i see these posts people give a break down on who contributes more money. If you are both working the same hours then the money is irrelevant. If one of you looks after kids full time then the money is irrelevant. He needs to adult better", "Absolutely NTA but he is not valuing you as an equal partner - he's starting to treat you like a maid. You're not a SAHW and it doesn't sound like you want to be - he needs to sort out his attitude and you both need to find a way forward domestically which works for you. \n\nIf money is his answer, could you hire someone to help with the housework and keep on top of it? But I think the actual labour here isn't the problem - it's his changing attitude that he is entitled to treat you like his staff.", "NTA. What in the patriarchal fuck. This asshat needs to be assigned the metafilter thread on emotional labor immediately.", "NTA\n\nIf he doesn't want to help out with the household then he should take his buckets of cash and hire someone to do his share of the tasks!", "NTA. The dollar amount of money that one contributes to the household should not factor into the division of household labor. The number of hours someone spends working? Sure, that should be considered. But just because he makes more money, he should do less housework? Nah, fuck that noise.", "NTA. He should be paying for everything if that\u2019s his expectation. And you would have to agree to the dynamic. Tell him to hire a maid and cook, because you\u2019re not his. \n\nHonestly it doesn\u2019t even sound like you contribute significantly less than he does financially anyway. With how much more he makes, he should be paying more than he is now, on top of stepping up at home.", "NTA - You\u2019ve said you\u2019re actively trying to advance your career whilst studying and he doesn\u2019t seem supportive of that. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s indirectly thinking that he is paying you for your labour and that is something which a relationship most certainly shouldn\u2019t involve.", "NTA. Whoaaa. He asked to trade places financially? That means he feels like you owe him to clean. \ud83d\ude2c", "YTA.\n\nI am guessing his job, based on salary, means he has a more stressful/difficult/skilled job, meaning he is more likely to be tired, and he contributes significantly more to the running of the house and lifestyle.\n\nIf you want things to be equal at home in respect of chores, then surely everything else should be equal, including bills. I am willing to bet you won\u2019t agree to this.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t do nothing obviously. Why not both compile a list of chores you each hate, and ask him to do those some/all that he doesn\u2019t hate from your list.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I live alone mostly in a house. My gf visits but i do all the chores. Doing laundry literally only takes maybe 10 minutes total. I don't understand what is there so much to clean. Or are people just living so dirty. Dishwasher washes the dishes, robot cleans the floor, robot also mows the lawn. Once a week wash the floor. Cooking takes minimal time because most of the time food is just cooking on the stove. Usually when people say \"i spent an hour on cooking\", what they mean is that they spent 10 minutes on prepping ingredients and 50min was idle when food was on the stove. And cooking isn't a chore. I've always cooked in every relationship and never seen it as a chore. My girlfriends have sometimes helped with the dishes. Are people just living really dirty or am i missing something. I even WFH. All my rooms are clean.", "NTA. Though also, is hard to imagine a situation where 1X (where X = the wage for an 8-5 job) + 6X  doesn't leave you comfortably off enough to get a cleaner. That plus some other bought services might take the load off both of you at this busy time.", "Does his reduced effort have a similar timeline to your studying? Maybe he thinks you're doing less, therefore his silent protest is to do less. Or he's deliberately trying to scupper your studies. Either way, there's a conversation that needs to be had.", "NTA. If his contribution is financial, then he can pay for a cleaner/housekeeper to cover his part. If he doesn't like that idea, he can do his shift", "I don\u2019t even have to read past the title. NTA. You\u2019re in a marriage and take care of the house equally.", "NTA. You and your husband should not look at the income to chores ratio but rather that both get equal downtime.", "No you're not the AH. \n\nIt doesn't matter how much you are each earning. \n\nI earn slightly more than my partner, but my days are a few hours shorter, that means I get home and do some housework so when she gets home, we can relax together rather than do boring housework. \n\nIt's not that you earn X and he earns X, you earn 7x together, he needs to get out of that mindset. We find this easiest by having a joint account where our salary's go to. And thats where all bills and things we do together come out of. And we each get a small amount for our own stuff.", "Thanks!", "100% this NTA", "Just curious, but how do you feel about a more recent post about a woman who is a teacher who's husband asked her to do more of the chores during the summer? Everyone is telling her she shouldn't have to, but by your logic she'd have more time available, so I'm just curious.", "Just curious, but how do you feel about a more recent post about a woman who is a teacher who's husband asked her to do more of the chores during the summer? Everyone is telling her she shouldn't have to, but by your logic she'd have more time available, so I'm just curious.", "This is exactly what I was thinking, getting a cleaning service would give both of you more time for other things and lower stress.", "We did look at cleaning agencies and it was expensive. We will revisit this option again.", "So happy for you!", "Another option is he hire someone who manages the house if he wants to use his money to solve this, but otherwise like another comment said \u2018chores take time, not money\u2019.\n\nNTA and he\u2019s pushing into financial bullying if that\u2019s a thing, before it\u2019s abusive anyway. \n\nGood on you for doing all that, most of us let it lapse into a daydream.", "Not the person you asked, but I\u2019d usually say she should do more in the summer (because chores are paid with time, I agree) but in that post specifically I\u2019m much more torn, because she just barely got him doing his own share, before that she was doing everything. One of the commenter says he wouldn\u2019t pick up the chores again easily in the fall, and honestly I think the chances of that are very high. I would personally let them settle into a routine this year and then next year take on more in the summer. I dislike the idea of disrupting things when they finally are starting to be more equal.", "I didn't see this post but it depends on how they split the chores the rest or the year and how different of similar their work schedule/charge is.\n\nMy ex partner and I had similar jobs with similar schedules overall, but at times we had bigger projects and deadlines that meant longer work days. If she was under a lot of stress and spent longer at work I would naturally take over a lit of her house chores. Same thing if the situation was reversed. And if both of us were going through the grinder it stayed 50/50. When she switched jobs and had a 2-months gap she went on a nice vacation but the rest of the time she did most of the chores; we didn't even discuss it, it just seemed obvious to us.\n\nSo if the chores are split fairly throughout the year, I'd say it's fair to expect for it to adapt during non-shared time off.", "Definitely get a cleaner, but contribute equally to the cost.", "He makes 6X what she does and refuses to do his share of the household work. If he wants a maid he can damn well pay a professional.", "Hmmm... I've been taken advantage of in this area of my life in the past, earning more and doing more chores also. They both work the same number of hours, so they should have the chores split evenly. If he isn't doing his, then he can pay for a cleaner to do that, but the easiest option is to get a cleaner to do it all and share the cost evenly.", "*equitably. Costs should be shared based on income in a partnership. He earns 6x as much as her but contributes half as much in terms of percentage of income. It's already inequitable despite him contributing more in total $. A cleaner to pick up his half of the work should be covered by him fully, if they both want to drop work then it should be split like all other expenses"]}
