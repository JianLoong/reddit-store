Your husband should be putting forth more of an effort to carry his weight. Who gives a fuck who makes more money?", "NTA. It's fair to contribute money according to your incomes for the same hours of work. It is, however, not fair to divide household chores according to income. \n\nHim having a better paying job doesn't make him more important.

I live alone mostly in a house. My gf visits but i do all the chores. Doing laundry literally only takes maybe 10 minutes total. I don't understand what is there so much to clean. Or are people just living so dirty. Dishwasher washes the dishes, robot cleans the floor, robot also mows the lawn. Once a week wash the floor. Cooking takes minimal time because most of the time food is just cooking on the stove. Usually when people say \"i spent an hour on cooking\", what they mean is that they spent 10 minutes on prepping ingredients and 50min was idle when food was on the stove. And cooking isn't a chore. I've always cooked in every relationship and never seen it as a chore. My girlfriends have sometimes helped with the dishes. Are people just living really dirty or am i missing something. I even WFH.

One of the commenter says he wouldn\u2019t pick up the chores again easily in the fall, and honestly I think the chances of that are very high.

If she was under a lot of stress and spent longer at work I would naturally take over a lit of her house chores. Same thing if the situation was reversed. And if both of us were going through the grinder it stayed 50/50. When she switched jobs and had a 2-months gap she went on a nice vacation but the rest of the time she did most of the chores; we didn't even discuss it, it just seemed obvious to us.\n\nSo if the chores are split fairly throughout the year, I'd say it's fair to expect for it to adapt during non-shared time off.", "Definitely get a cleaner, but contribute equally to the cost.", "He makes 6X what she does and refuses to do his share of the household work.

Currently, he has things pretty jammy. You\u2019re his live-in maid with benefits, but not his equal. He needs to seriously re-think his stance, and maybe you should re-think what you\u2018ve gotten in to. And here\u2019s the thing.

I eprsonally think you can try and apply numbers to this stuff.  In your case it's not equal.\n\n1.  If he makes 6x he should pay 6x more.  Why does he only pay 3x more.\n2.  Calculate house chores by time and don't factor in salary.", "Get a cleaner/housekeeper. Why not get help when you need it? It sounds like it\u2019s affordable for you.\n\nThe thing is, if he is earning a high salary then he probably does need to work at night reviewing things etc, in the same way you need to study. These things are both important and time consuming.", "Yep.", "OP do you realize that there are some relationships where 1 person\u2019s only contribution is companionship, connection and emotional support?

Just from your post it feels like he knows this and doesnt want to give it up.  You are NTA. Why should his income level dictate how much chores he is responsible for? You are both working the same # of hours.", "NTA. For me it sounds like he's trying to sabotage your studies. Maybe he enjoys the power imbalance which came with you earning less?

Moreover we are rotating tasks so that one isn't stuck with an unloved one all the time.\nThis way we can objectivize the topic without making it overly emotional.

I agree with your husband. If he\u2019s bringing more into the house you have to or should make up the difference In another way. Hire a cleaner? Maybe suggest that you become a stay at home house wife or get a part time job. I mean why do you even have to work if he\u2019s making 6X more than you, do you guys need your income to survive. Are you guys planning on having kids if you don\u2019t already. Do you think it\u2019s the best environment to have kids with both of you working out of the house all day and to tired to potentially take care of future kids and cleaning and cooking.

No hate to anyone- this is just what works for me- been married 5 years: we both have all our money go into one account we share. From that account we transfer an amount to pay all bills and groceries/monthly expenses + some extra to a checking account. We both have cards for this account to pay what\u2019s necessary like if I go grocery shopping or he buys stuff to fix the house. Then we both have separate accounts we decided on a percentage of both our income combined to be put into that account per month. So like we each get 2 grand per month in our separate accounts. This is to do whatever we want with it. He uses it to golf and I use it to get my nails done etc, we can save on our own in this account and don\u2019t have to consult each other about purchases but can see the others transactions. Finally we have a shared emergency fund and shared savings together for trips,etc. (There\u2019s a couple others for investments/retirements but that\u2019s getting into too much). In the event of a divorce the prenup already made would be able to say what money goes where.  The fact that he makes more shouldn\u2019t mean anything if you\u2019re married- that\u2019s the way I see it.. otherwise why get married when you\u2019re acting like college roomies? He should be helping with chores the same amount as you. If he doesn\u2019t- just cook dinner for yourself for a week and make him cook his own. This is a partnership- so he\u2019s being the asshole by acting like he\u2019s above you", "NTA- just because he makes more money does NOT mean he works harder. Sometimes that\u2019s true, but like you work the same hours and unless he\u2019s working an oil rig or an ER nurse (I\u2019m trying to think of physically/mentally/emotionally exhausting jobs) he can fricken wash the dishes.", "NTA. You make 1/7 of the household income but are paying 1/3 to 1/2 of household expenses. That math ain\u2019t mathing. Technically, you are subsidizing his lifestyle. AND he wants you to be his housekeeper, cook, and general dogsbody to boot?\nThis guy is a flaming A. If he makes so much money maybe he should be paying for a maid and a cook.", "NTA\n\nYour earning less doesn\u2019t magically make you have more time\n\nHowever, you should get help.", "I was gonna ask how much are they making, sounds like they should eat out more often!", ">It sounds like you're both working equally hard and roughly the same amount. The fact he makes more doesn't factor into it.\n\nIf he is earning 6 times her salary, they aren't working an equal amount.\n\nPeople basically get paid for the complexity of the work they do, otherwise why wouldn't she just take that job with 6 times the salary.\n\nEvery person in a couple should benefit from the coupling, some person getting a massive amount of additional money and the other getting literally nothing in exchange isn't fair.  At the very least she should be doing 2/3 fo the chores while he does 1/3rd.", "That\u2019s a ridiculous assumption. There are plenty of high paying low stress jobs", "I don\u2019t see why my feedback would be any different in that situation. I think once you\u2019re having these kind of conversations about mutual care for a shared home, that a part of the relationship has already died. Especially in a situation where time available shifts so drastically through the year like for a teacher, if the teacher is making excuses not to contribute to the house when they have ample time off then I imagine the non-teacher spouse would be a little resentful when the teacher spouse has grade homework or work after hours during the school year and there\u2019s a really easy slippery slope down to mistrust of time available being communicated, and then resentment. \n\nYou also have to keep in mind gender dynamics in a household. Women have spent generations carrying the majority of home-based labor and statistically they continue to disproportionately carry home-based labor so being emotionally sensitive to that sexism is a really difficult factor to add on top of time dynamics. That\u2019s not to say that my advice would necessarily change, but just that there are aspects of being a woman, and being a teacher that make that situation or the advice I\u2019d give fact-specific.", "I never saw that post and I'm not who you asked either but I can speak from experience on that one. I have a seasonal occupation where I work more than full time 4 months out of the year and part time the rest of it. During those 4 months my husband totally steps up and helps with chores because I am home way less so we both pull our weight then, but then when I go back to part time, I pick up more of the chores (he still helps) but more stuff falls on me which I'm good with because I am home more. It's all about balance in a relationship and stepping up when you need to. Do you happen to have the link of that post?", "I didn\u2019t see it, but usually the deal with teachers is they\u2019re crazy busy during school year (come home to marking, lesson prep etc), and get longer holidays \n\nSo there\u2019s two ways that kind of couple could handle it: 1) they each do the same share all year round, and she\u2019d have less free time during term and more free time during holidays but he stays pretty constant or 2) he does more chores during term and she does less, and then she does more during holidays - so he has less free time during term and more free time during holidays \n\nIn general though, research has shown that on average, in heterosexual relationships, men do far less chores, and also aren\u2019t able to accurately estimate their share contribution to the household in terms of time spent on unenjoyable tasks - they underestimate what the woman does and/or overestimate what they do \n\nSo yes, on average, a man coming in here asking for judgement on chore redistribution will be different to a woman looking for redistribution, because that\u2019s the data", "By this logic, the woman would always be the one primarily responsible for all the chores because women are paid less than men on average. Not a fair deal. \n\nHow much you are paid has nothing to do with the amount of work you put into your job, imo. People paid less honestly tend to work harder than people with higher-wage jobs. Wage has more to do with privilege, education background, not your work ethic.", "My comment was high stress/skilled/difficult- it is generally accepted that higher pay is for roles with this criteria. That is why the Doctor gets paid more than the cleaner - this is not controversial. There are of course the odd exceptions, but they are rare.\n\nHowever, if there are plenty of these jobs - can I suggest a career in recruitment, as you appear to know something the vast majority of the workforce don\u2019t know.", "I didn\u2019t read that other post, but I absolutely anticipated that that was going to be an issue when I answered this comment. Men are\u2026 predictable.", "If you don\u2019t think low paying jobs can be hard work then you\u2019re completely out of touch", "Hard - yes. Absolutely.  I have worked several low paying jobs and know they can be very hard work.\n\nStraw-doll arguments don\u2019t further conversations. Nor does putting words in my mouth, or drawing conclusions in those circumstances.\n\nI suggest you read carefully what I am saying.", "You suggested the because he earns more money that he has a more tiring job so she should do more housework. My \u201cstraw-doll\u201d argument is that her low paying job might be far more tiring that his and just because he\u2019s paid more doesn\u2019t absolve him from contributing around the house"]}
