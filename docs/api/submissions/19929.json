About nine months ago, my wife decided she never wanted to be a mother, divorced me, and basically signed away her rights to the kids, we get child support and that's it. Obviously this has been extremely hard on them, and I have them in bothqq individual and family therapy to try and help them worth through this.\n\nThe issue is my son blames his sister. She's sometimes you're typical moody teen, even though she's really a wonderful kid. Her and her mother had been fighting a lot before she left, and my son thinks despite me and two therapists telling him otherwise that she's responsible for it. They've been fighting constantly, destroying eachothers stuff and constantly screaming at eachother. They've probably spent 3/4ths of the past nine months grounded for this.\n\nFamily therapy hasn't been going well because of this. My son refuses to engage when it comes to his sister, and won't hear any talk that this isn't her fault. Things finally blew up two weeks ago, when the family therapist was at least trying to bring him down from fighting with her. The therapist basically said something like \"I know you still love your sister-\" and my son cut him off and said \"No I don't, I'd still have a mother if it wasn't for her.\" While looking right at her.\n\nThe session was more or less over after that, none of us knew what to say and my daughter looked so broken. When we left I told my son he's grounded full stop until the new school year starts, no phone, no friends, nothing. Things have been even worse at home, he won't even acknowledge she exists, and will leave the room if she enters. My own therapist said this was a mistake to punish him for speaking his mind, but I don't think he should be allowed to be so hurtful", "created_utc": 1687044341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14c525u/aita_for_grounding_my_son_after_he_told_his/", "score": 1411, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

About nine months ago, my wife decided she never wanted to be a mother, divorced me, and basically signed away her rights to the kids, we get child support and that's it. Obviously this has been extremely hard on them, and I have them in bothqq individual and family therapy to try and help them worth through this.\n\nThe issue is my son blames his sister. She's sometimes you're typical moody teen, even though she's really a wonderful kid. Her and her mother had been fighting a lot before she left, and my son thinks despite me and two therapists telling him otherwise that she's responsible for it. They've been fighting constantly, destroying eachothers stuff and constantly screaming at eachother. They've probably spent 3/4ths of the past nine months grounded for this.\n\nFamily therapy hasn't been going well because of this. My son refuses to engage when it comes to his sister, and won't hear any talk that this isn't her fault. Things finally blew up two weeks ago, when the family therapist was at least trying to bring him down from fighting with her. The therapist basically said something like \"I know you still love your sister-\" and my son cut him off and said \"No I don't, I'd still have a mother if it wasn't for her.\" While looking right at her.\n\nThe session was more or less over after that, none of us knew what to say and my daughter looked so broken. When we left I told my son he's grounded full stop until the new school year starts, no phone, no friends, nothing. Things have been even worse at home, he won't even acknowledge she exists, and will leave the room if she enters. My own therapist said this was a mistake to punish him for speaking his mind, but I don't think he should be allowed to be so hurtful\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s far less likely that him blaming his sister is irrational and unfounded than there is actually some truth to this and your wife\u2019s relationship with her daughter was a point of conflict in the family for a long time before she left.

It might have been better to have your son to just do individual therapy instead of family therapy until he is in a better place mentally.\n\nI am sure it has been enormously difficult these past 9 months.

You need to tell him that almost all (exceptions to every rule) mother's and daughters have tension around the teen years BUT that most mothers don't leave. While you understand he is hurt and he can't be angry at his mom because in his heart he is hoping she comes back and he doesn't want to make her angry it is not OK to use his sister as his emotional punching bag.

Your decision to punish him in this situation is also going to make any future meaningful family therapy very unlikely because he will not feel safe enough to be vulnerable and share his true feelings.\n\nAlso, you mention they\u2019ve both spent most of the time since mom leaving grounded. You do realize by grounding them you are taking away most of their coping tools and support network right?

I am not reading anything that indicates they are ready to be in family therapy together.\n\nI am actually okay with the idea of taking phones/grounding, but I think it should be shorter term and you should target the very worst behaviors they are showing. You mention they are constantly screaming/fighting/destroying each other's stuff.\n\nSo I'd set the rules that if there is any fighting/screaming, they both lose their phones/electronics for the next 24 hours and are also grounded for the next 24 hours. Make it immediate and attached to the specific behavior, but also over quickly, so they have the opportunity to earn back privileges through better choices. If someone destroys someone's stuff, they are grounded/lose electronics for 72 hours and also have to pay for it from their own allowance (and if they don't get an allowance, find nasty chores they can do to earn the money--scrubbing bathrooms, mowing the lawn, cleaning the oven, weeding the garden.) They don't get their electronics back until the chores are completed successfully.\n\nBut I would not ground your son for what he said in therapy because I think one has to be allowed to say the truth in therapy even if it is awful.

Does she have any contact with any of you? \n2. What do the therapists suggest doing to root out this delusion in your son's mind? There are lots of psychological reasons a child won't blame his parents for things they deserve blame for. (Kids need parents to survive, so rather than blame the parents, kids will sometimes blame themselves or in this case their siblings when parents rightly deserve the blame.) Does your son's therapists have any suggestions for how to get your son to acknowledge that this was his mother's choice and not the fault of him or his sister?\n3. I hate the idea of tearing up the stability of your children's home further than it has already been, but is this bullying/fighting getting so destructive that it will cause long-term harm to your daughter to the point that they need to live in separate homes (with grandparents, etc?)\n4.

I mean, can you imagine the psychological damage if you learn that your own mother doesn't love you and resents you for burdening her?  I asked my lawyer to sue for full custody.  I was advised not to.  The way he put it, this will drag out for many years, and cost you hundreds of thousands in legal fees.   And in the end, you have a penis, so you lose...\n\nNow SINCE THAT TIME, winds are changing.  I understand that NOW, family courts are a bit less hostile in mis-treating fathers.

Unwelcome advice isn't necessarily bad advice.  He wasn't going to tell me what I wanted to hear.  He was telling me how fucked I'd get if I did the right thing.  Sigh...\n\nIt all turned out OK.  My ex managed to act like she gave a shit.  So my kids survived.  Years later, she re-married a guy who I have a ton of respect for.  He's a great role-model to both my kids, and takes an active interest in raising them.  Spends a lot more time and effort with my kids than their mom does.  Not surprisingly.  \n\nSo the kids are thriving.  They have my money and a good father (even if he didn't provide the genes)  Their mom works 80+ hours a week, probably just to get away from the kids.  The house has three incomes, the two fathers alone provide more than enough income....she wouldn't need to work.  But she does.  ALL. THE. TIME.  If I ever need to talk to her, I have to make an appointment, as she's never home...\n\nBoth kids are straight A students and participate in many sports and other activities outside of school.

It is not too late though, just talk with your son and try to explain to him that it was his mother that walked out on him, not his sister, and that as bad as he feels about the situation she probably feels ten times worse since after her mother quitting on her now her brother hates her too?

I have an argument for literally every judgement here. I think you need to take a step back and give your kids some time apart. Increase individual therapy appointments.

However, they're just learning ammo to use against each other. It's like how you're not supposed to go to marriage counseling with an abusive spouse because you're showing them how you're vulnerable by being in therapy together.

He\u2019s not there yet, and trying to force it is only going to cause hurt and resentment.\n\nI would start out by apologizing and say that you overreacted and he should be able to be honest about his feelings.

We foster teens and use many of the techniques with good success. Obviously your situation will be a little bit different due to when the trauma occurred, but I think you will find it overall helpful. Progress can absolutely be made and the relationship repaired- just know that it will take a significant amount of time. We\u2019re talking months or even years. But punishing him for speaking his mind when he was specifically asked to speak his mind (therapy) will only cause him to resent his sister further.

As for therapy, seems it\u2019s focused on making what\u2019s left of your family sing kumbaye and be all happy together. Ever hear that hurt people hurt people? Your kids are hurting. You\u2019re hurting. So everyone becomes a target for your hurt. This therapist was doing the same thing you\u2019re trying to do - make everyone pretend to be happy. Ain\u2019t. Gonna. Happen. Humans don\u2019t function that way. At least not for long. And that\u2019s where you are now. First, get a new therapist. Actually, get 3. In different offices. Separately. You each get one. Tell your kids they get to choose who they want to see. Most insurance companies have a website with all the doctors who take their insurance. The kids are old enough to figure out how to use it.

You can also tell him the house rules are you act politely towards each other. If he hates his sister that much ask that he tries to not be in the same room with her at the same time.

Grounding them and taking away all sorts of release will make things inevitably worse because the wrong ideas will just take a stronger hold...\n\nIf I were you, id take your son out, somewhere you guys feel familiar and comfortable in, and have a heart to heart, and listen,just listen, don't try to \"correct\" the way he's feeling show him you really understand, and after he's done maybe present things from a perspective he hasn't been seeing, talk to him like a person... Grounding isn't going to solve shit... You need to slowly and methodically clean the wound\n\n\nThen take your daughter out, talk to her as well see how she's doing, make sure she knows a grown woman's decisions aren't hers to bear and that her brothers hurting but she's done nothing wrong... And let her know you've got her back and you love her\n\nI'd also pause family therapy (temporarily) since they need to work on themselves individually before they really face eachother other... Instead maybe start some new family tradition something all of you can bond over and slowly rebuild bridges...\n\n\nI know this is a lot for you emotionally,mentally and all modes of existence... But unfortunately what happens now will probably shape not only their relationship with eachother, but with you, and will shape parts of who they are that will always be part of them...so don't act rashly think of the consequences of your decisions long term...

Sister shouldn\u2019t have been there for that but as she was, the therapist should have taken the time to diffuse the situation and ensure sister was given tools to handle this. As OP said nothing about how this was handled, I can only assume this therapist is not good for this family and failed at her job here. Group therapy, where there is any conflict, is likely to bring hurtful and cutting thoughts to the forefront. How they are handled and dealt with are the responsibility of the professional and the professional should have separated these sessions long ago it seems like.

If it\u2019s not possible in family, individual only.  \n\nTrying to focus on love when there\u2019s no trust and minimal function and two abandoned kids is a bridge too far right now.", "It would be so cool if I still got free rewards.\n\nLets go ahead and say that again....\n\nTherapy is not a free pass to be verbally abusive to others.\r  \n\r  \nTherapy is not a free pass to be verbally abusive to others.  \nTherapy is not a free pass to be verbally abusive to others.  \nNOT EVEN IN A THERAPISTS OFFICE.  This child is freely abusing another child and y'all pyschopaths are like, Abuse is okay because it was in a therapists office...\n\nLike I would love to see the mental gymnastics y'all do when you reply to this.", "The son is emotional and in a space where speaking your true thoughts is meant to be safe. The son didn't 'verbally abuse' anyone, the therapist failed at mediating and keeping the conversation safe for two distraught children and OP is just failing in general.", "Being promoted with a statement and correcting it, especially one about emotions during therapy, is absolutely not absuive. The son has his thoughts and feelings and he doesn't exactly get to just click them away", "Hey guess what, this means that is someone is using group therapy to verbally abuse someone else, you stop taking them to group therapy. It doesn't mean that you punish them when they finally open up about their feelings.\n\nThere were a million signs before this group therapy wasn't working and OP just shrugged his shoulders and tried nothing else.\n\nIt's abusive to tell a child how they are feeling when you are a person of authority. And then to punish them for asserting their actual feelings is horrific. The above interaction, though unfortunate and hurtful for the sister to listen to, isn't verbal abuse on behalf of the child, sorry to burst your bubble.", "Is he not supposed to say how he feels during therapy?", "Someone tells a girl how feels is that she should serve him. He\u2019s not an asshole? Because he said how he felt? Yeah\u2026 you\u2019re mental", "He is an asshole. If someone said something racist or sexist, or homophonic, they wouldn\u2019t be considered an asshole? Why because being racist and sexist is how they feel? Lol! Saying how you feeling can still be evil and horrible and rude. Someone says how they feel: \u201cI really want to kill you\u201d oh that\u2019s okay because you said how you feel.\n\nYeah you know that doesn\u2019t mean crap, the son is slowly becoming verbally abusive and could be something more, the sister is only 14,  he\u2019s 18 in two years, he can easily grow up and mature, but no, he doesn\u2019t blame the mom or dad, just the 14 year old.\n\nI hope you never have kids, it\u2019s obvious that you are bias and one of your kids would easily get hurt", "I can see that point of view if you lack any empathy and are totally self righteous.", "Agreed. I said in other comments that the advice I would give is individual therapy only until the son can treat his sister appropriately. He needs to come to terms that mom would have left regardless of his sister was there or not before being in a room with her so she can be protected more from those sentiments. Also needs a new therapist as this therapist is clearly incompetent for not being able to diffuse this situation", "In fact I think someone in power (therapist) telling you how you feel (not how you SHOULD feel) is abusive.", "I had a friend in a very similar situation to yours, in his case he simply negotiated a higher alimony payment with the wife in lieu of that child support money. It hit the wallet a bit hard but he said it was better for everyone in the family, it made everyone happier.", "This story really should be a post. I know exactly how I'd vote. \ud83d\ude2c", "I mean she could like working too, some people enjoy having a career and the self worth it brings them.  I mean obviously she's done a lot of morally shitty things, but some women like to work because they find fulfillment in having a career - even if they don't \"need\" to.  People can derive self worth from job related achievements.  And people can also feel uncomfortable being financially dependent on someone else and want to work even if their own income is supplementary.", "Honestly, I agree. Some feelings and opinions are assholish at their root.", "Interesting.  Did he get full custody of the kids?   Sounds like a great, but not perfect, outcome.", "Thanks.  I'm advising both my kids to never get married and never have children.  That is not because of my failed marriage.  It's that, since I was their age, dating has radically changed.  I don't think marriage is good for anybody anymore.   Yes, there are exceptions.  Some good ones still exist.  Like you can still find a '66 T-Bird in mint condition, if you try hard enough.  But it's to the point where it takes gargantuan effort to find somebody worth committing to.  And even then, the odds of long-term (More than two years) success is depressingly low.  Better to focus on fitness, career and retirement investments.   Marry yourself!!!!", "Not entirely full, no. They did a mediated divorce and so both agreed to him having primary physical custody and the kids were supposed to do two weekends a month at her house. In reality, the mother took off out of state to somewhere warmer and would pop back in every now and then for visits like her flighty self. If he were a lesser man, I think he'd be pissed off that his money was going towards funding her lifestyle, but he said she bore him two great kids and it was better she used the cash to go on yoga retreats to Arizona constantly than be miserable around them. When the kids got a few years older, he filed for a reduction in alimony, she was going to do a retaliatory \"well then I want full custody, you'll never see the kids ahaha\" but her lawyer set her straight that that's not really a thing that happens in reality, courts want what's best for the kids and he had the sole parent for such a long time that there was no way she was even going to be able to regain 50/50 custody without first taking the time to reestablish any kind of relationship with the kids (who were teens and wanted nothing to do with her anymore.)", "Whew. I don't think you picked up what I'm putting down. \n\nBut yeah for sure your kids should love themselves first and foremost. Saying romance is doomed is...an interesting take."]}
