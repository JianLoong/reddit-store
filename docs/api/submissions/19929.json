About nine months ago, my wife decided she never wanted to be a mother, divorced me, and basically signed away her rights to the kids, we get child support and that's it. Obviously this has been extremely hard on them, and I have them in bothqq individual and family therapy to try and help them worth through this.\n\nThe issue is my son blames his sister. She's sometimes you're typical moody teen, even though she's really a wonderful kid. Her and her mother had been fighting a lot before she left, and my son thinks despite me and two therapists telling him otherwise that she's responsible for it. They've been fighting constantly, destroying eachothers stuff and constantly screaming at eachother. They've probably spent 3/4ths of the past nine months grounded for this.\n\nFamily therapy hasn't been going well because of this. My son refuses to engage when it comes to his sister, and won't hear any talk that this isn't her fault. Things finally blew up two weeks ago, when the family therapist was at least trying to bring him down from fighting with her. The therapist basically said something like \"I know you still love your sister-\" and my son cut him off and said \"No I don't, I'd still have a mother if it wasn't for her.\" While looking right at her.\n\nThe session was more or less over after that, none of us knew what to say and my daughter looked so broken. When we left I told my son he's grounded full stop until the new school year starts, no phone, no friends, nothing. Things have been even worse at home, he won't even acknowledge she exists, and will leave the room if she enters. My own therapist said this was a mistake to punish him for speaking his mind, but I don't think he should be allowed to be so hurtful", "created_utc": 1687044341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14c525u/aita_for_grounding_my_son_after_he_told_his/", "score": 6839, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

About nine months ago, my wife decided she never wanted to be a mother, divorced me, and basically signed away her rights to the kids, we get child support and that's it. Obviously this has been extremely hard on them, and I have them in bothqq individual and family therapy to try and help them worth through this.\n\nThe issue is my son blames his sister. She's sometimes you're typical moody teen, even though she's really a wonderful kid. Her and her mother had been fighting a lot before she left, and my son thinks despite me and two therapists telling him otherwise that she's responsible for it. They've been fighting constantly, destroying eachothers stuff and constantly screaming at eachother. They've probably spent 3/4ths of the past nine months grounded for this.\n\nFamily therapy hasn't been going well because of this. My son refuses to engage when it comes to his sister, and won't hear any talk that this isn't her fault. Things finally blew up two weeks ago, when the family therapist was at least trying to bring him down from fighting with her. The therapist basically said something like \"I know you still love your sister-\" and my son cut him off and said \"No I don't, I'd still have a mother if it wasn't for her.\" While looking right at her.\n\nThe session was more or less over after that, none of us knew what to say and my daughter looked so broken. When we left I told my son he's grounded full stop until the new school year starts, no phone, no friends, nothing. Things have been even worse at home, he won't even acknowledge she exists, and will leave the room if she enters.

It\u2019s far less likely that him blaming his sister is irrational and unfounded than there is actually some truth to this and your wife\u2019s relationship with her daughter was a point of conflict in the family for a long time before she left.

It might have been better to have your son to just do individual therapy instead of family therapy until he is in a better place mentally.\n\nI am sure it has been enormously difficult these past 9 months.

Hopefully with time and therapy he will eventually get better and you are sorry she is hurting and are trying to do your best and you love her\n\nAs for you son. You need to tell him that almost all (exceptions to every rule) mother's and daughters have tension around the teen years BUT that most mothers don't leave. While you understand he is hurt and he can't be angry at his mom because in his heart he is hoping she comes back and he doesn't want to make her angry it is not OK to use his sister as his emotional punching bag.

Your decision to punish him in this situation is also going to make any future meaningful family therapy very unlikely because he will not feel safe enough to be vulnerable and share his true feelings.\n\nAlso, you mention they\u2019ve both spent most of the time since mom leaving grounded. You do realize by grounding them you are taking away most of their coping tools and support network right?

I am not reading anything that indicates they are ready to be in family therapy together.\n\nI am actually okay with the idea of taking phones/grounding, but I think it should be shorter term and you should target the very worst behaviors they are showing. You mention they are constantly screaming/fighting/destroying each other's stuff.\n\nSo I'd set the rules that if there is any fighting/screaming, they both lose their phones/electronics for the next 24 hours and are also grounded for the next 24 hours. Make it immediate and attached to the specific behavior, but also over quickly, so they have the opportunity to earn back privileges through better choices. If someone destroys someone's stuff, they are grounded/lose electronics for 72 hours and also have to pay for it from their own allowance (and if they don't get an allowance, find nasty chores they can do to earn the money--scrubbing bathrooms, mowing the lawn, cleaning the oven, weeding the garden.) They don't get their electronics back until the chores are completed successfully.\n\nBut I would not ground your son for what he said in therapy because I think one has to be allowed to say the truth in therapy even if it is awful.

Does she have any contact with any of you? \n2. What do the therapists suggest doing to root out this delusion in your son's mind? There are lots of psychological reasons a child won't blame his parents for things they deserve blame for. (Kids need parents to survive, so rather than blame the parents, kids will sometimes blame themselves or in this case their siblings when parents rightly deserve the blame.) Does your son's therapists have any suggestions for how to get your son to acknowledge that this was his mother's choice and not the fault of him or his sister?\n3. I hate the idea of tearing up the stability of your children's home further than it has already been, but is this bullying/fighting getting so destructive that it will cause long-term harm to your daughter to the point that they need to live in separate homes (with grandparents, etc?)\n4.

I mean, can you imagine the psychological damage if you learn that your own mother doesn't love you and resents you for burdening her?  I asked my lawyer to sue for full custody.

Unwelcome advice isn't necessarily bad advice.  He wasn't going to tell me what I wanted to hear.  He was telling me how fucked I'd get if I did the right thing.  Sigh...\n\nIt all turned out OK.  My ex managed to act like she gave a shit.  So my kids survived.  Years later, she re-married a guy who I have a ton of respect for.  He's a great role-model to both my kids, and takes an active interest in raising them.  Spends a lot more time and effort with my kids than their mom does.  Not surprisingly.  \n\nSo the kids are thriving.  They have my money and a good father (even if he didn't provide the genes)  Their mom works 80+ hours a week, probably just to get away from the kids.  The house has three incomes, the two fathers alone provide more than enough income....she wouldn't need to work.  But she does.  ALL. THE. TIME.  If I ever need to talk to her, I have to make an appointment, as she's never home...\n\nBoth kids are straight A students and participate in many sports and other activities outside of school.

It is not too late though, just talk with your son and try to explain to him that it was his mother that walked out on him, not his sister, and that as bad as he feels about the situation she probably feels ten times worse since after her mother quitting on her now her brother hates her too?

I have an argument for literally every judgement here. I think you need to take a step back and give your kids some time apart. Increase individual therapy appointments.

However, they're just learning ammo to use against each other. It's like how you're not supposed to go to marriage counseling with an abusive spouse because you're showing them how you're vulnerable by being in therapy together.

We foster teens and use many of the techniques with good success. Obviously your situation will be a little bit different due to when the trauma occurred, but I think you will find it overall helpful. Progress can absolutely be made and the relationship repaired- just know that it will take a significant amount of time. We\u2019re talking months or even years. But punishing him for speaking his mind when he was specifically asked to speak his mind (therapy) will only cause him to resent his sister further.

I mean, the anger has to go somewhere. He kind of volunteered to be the whipping boy by saying why he thinks things went south. Poor kid just didn\u2019t know that until it was too late. As for therapy, seems it\u2019s focused on making what\u2019s left of your family sing kumbaye and be all happy together. Ever hear that hurt people hurt people? Your kids are hurting. You\u2019re hurting. So everyone becomes a target for your hurt. This therapist was doing the same thing you\u2019re trying to do - make everyone pretend to be happy. Ain\u2019t. Gonna. Happen. Humans don\u2019t function that way. At least not for long. And that\u2019s where you are now. First, get a new therapist. Actually, get 3. In different offices. Separately. You each get one. Tell your kids they get to choose who they want to see. Most insurance companies have a website with all the doctors who take their insurance. The kids are old enough to figure out how to use it.

Their feelings may stem from some wrong ideas but the only way to actually allow wounds to heal isn't to cover it you have to open it and clean it so it heals properly... Grounding them and taking away all sorts of release will make things inevitably worse because the wrong ideas will just take a stronger hold...\n\nIf I were you, id take your son out, somewhere you guys feel familiar and comfortable in, and have a heart to heart, and listen,just listen, don't try to \"correct\" the way he's feeling show him you really understand, and after he's done maybe present things from a perspective he hasn't been seeing, talk to him like a person... Grounding isn't going to solve shit... You need to slowly and methodically clean the wound\n\n\nThen take your daughter out, talk to her as well see how she's doing, make sure she knows a grown woman's decisions aren't hers to bear and that her brothers hurting but she's done nothing wrong... And let her know you've got her back and you love her\n\nI'd also pause family therapy (temporarily) since they need to work on themselves individually before they really face eachother other... Instead maybe start some new family tradition something all of you can bond over and slowly rebuild bridges...\n\n\nI know this is a lot for you emotionally,mentally and all modes of existence...

Sister shouldn\u2019t have been there for that but as she was, the therapist should have taken the time to diffuse the situation and ensure sister was given tools to handle this. As OP said nothing about how this was handled, I can only assume this therapist is not good for this family and failed at her job here. Group therapy, where there is any conflict, is likely to bring hurtful and cutting thoughts to the forefront.

She can\u2019t have a safe space in family therapy or at home because now her older brother is verbally berating her there, too.

He can fix it and I think people are being harsh with him when he just really needs advice.

Maybe you can work on a good apology with your therapist that might mitigate some of the damage.\n\nBut, seriously, your kids shouldn\u2019t be in therapy together just yet. Your son needs to work on his anger issues and your daughter shouldn\u2019t have to be a punching bag while he figures it out. You can try doing therapy with each of your children separately for now.

I think the son is lashing out at the only person he can reach, and responded honestly in an emotional way to a direct question.  Whatever love is there is buried under hurt and pain and anger from being abandoned by his mother.\n\nBottom line, group/family therapy is a bad idea.  He is not ready. He can't handle it.

The fact that the therapist didn't know what to do when the boy said he didn't love his sister is scary.

By punishing your son for something he said in a place designed to get him to say what he\u2019s feeling, you teach the lesson that therapy is *not* a safe space, and I can almost guarantee that if your son truly doesn\u2019t feel anymore love for his sister right now, that won\u2019t get better by forcing him to not talk about it. Now, obviously saying things like that can\u2019t just be happening all the time with no consequences, bc as safe as a space as it is, therapy isn\u2019t just a \u201cget to attack whoever you want even if they\u2019re also in therapy with you, even if it causes further trauma, no questions asked!\u201d place, any good therapist will be able to balance that.

He hates his sister, he is allowed to say so, especially when someone is trying to push in the opposite direction. \n\nI doubt someone tried to tell that poor kid their situation logically. Like, if you think your sister is to blame, why didnt your mother at least contact you to ease your mind? What kind of parent abandons their whole family just for one kid?", "So OP is TA for having them in family therapy when they aren't ready for family therapy in the first place, even before we get to punishing the son for what's said in therapy.  Garbage in, garbage out.", "This isn't true. You're confusing the therapist's obligations confused with the client's. There's no requirement for a client attending the same session to not react to anything related to a therapy session. If someone started verbally abusing their partner in couple's counseling, or calling them names, it wouldn't be OK because it's in a therapy setting.\n\nYou guys don't know how therapy works.", "Man people really not reading in this thread.  The therapist didn't say it was a mistake, OP's individual therapist said it was.", "I made another comment on it, but I'd be certain that to OPs son it feels like OP is just paying a person to sit in a room with them all and tell the son he's wrong. Then when the son doesn't play along he's punished. It's not therapy, it's just paying an extra adult to agree with OP and sister and berate the son.\n\nhe needs his own therapist, they need to establish trust by not telling OP everything son says and allow son to vent and learn. Then when trust is established maybe they can work on why son feels like he does and maybe turn it around. The way it's structured now the son has zero reason to trust anything, especially OP.", "I don't understand why there's a belief that family always love each other.  It's entirely possible that the son doesn't love his sister, at least at the moment, probably hasn't for a long time... and may never love her again, if this resentment continues.  Being blood-related to someone doesn't automatically create feelings of love for them.", "I know. I thought about suing when I reached 18. But my parents are both excellent lawyers, and a big part of their job was to persuade their clients NOT to sue, at times when they might have a case but it would still nevertheless be a stupid idea. In this case, my dad persuaded me not to try -- not because he thought I wouldn't win, but because he thought it wouldn't be worth it.", "its shit like this that makes me realise how god damn lucky I got with my therapist.\n\nI recommended them to a friend because of how good they are, and since that friend had come up in some sessions when I told my therapist about how they nearly met, my therapist said something along the lines of \"While I of course never discuss anything between patients, if that friend were to visit me it could cause a potential conflict of interest, no matter how slight I don't think I should be the one they visit\"", "FYI this still happens. Its why my wife wont go to therapy. Not that she needs it, but her feelings have frequently been shared based on what she and her brother have gone through.", "Also deeply misogynistic.", "Wish I could afford gold for you. This sub is acting fucking crazy right now.", "TL;DR: I agree with you for the most part and I'm glad someone said this, because he definitely needs to protect his daughter from this behavior. This is such a tricky situation with pain on all sides and my heart goes out to OP. There are no easy fixes for this.\n\nEven though I understand where he was coming from, I do think OP was wrong to punish his son for something said in therapy, because that's the one place where you *need* him to feel 100% comfortable speaking his mind no matter what. And it can also inadvertently send the message that the behavior itself is okay as long as you keep it behind closed doors, which is the last thing this kid needs to learn.\n\nThe real problem in this particular instance is that his sister never should have been in the room to begin with - and it was ultimately the therapist's job to recognize that before someone got hurt so badly, not anyone else's. They weren't ready for these sessions, and the therapist should have come up with a better course of action (like just starting with one kid at a time plus dad, etc).\n\nHowever, like you, I also can't blame the father at all for being instinctively protective of his daughter in that moment. What her brother said is something that will no doubt echo in her head for the rest of her life. It was truly the *worst* thing he could have said to this poor girl, who also lost her mother and probably already blames herself.\n\nAnd frankly, it's the kind of thing that could drive someone to harm themselves under the right circumstances. I would encourage OP to keep a close eye out for any signs of that.\n\nSo I 100% agree with you that she deserves to be protected from this kind of behavior, at home or otherwise. He's hurting, but that doesn't mean he gets to be unapologetically cruel to his little sister, who hasn't done anything to deserve it. And ultimately, him avoiding his sister completely *is* a much better outcome than him continuing to say those hateful things to her every day - so I guess the punishment at least accomplished one thing.\n\nBut that brings me to my main issue with his approach here: If all it took was this punishment to make his son start ignoring his sister, then why didn't OP step in to issue that punishment any of the *other* times his son said or did similarly hurtful things *outside* of therapy? That would have been much more appropriate, and it sounds like there have been plenty of opportunities given the number of incidents in the home.\n\nLetting him use his sister as a punching bag all week and then expecting him to take therapy seriously was just never going to work; he's already able to say whatever hurtful thing he wants 24/7, so what incentive does he have to dig any deeper and make the time count? That's why I feel like OP's approach was very backwards and counterintuitive. Make *therapy* the space where he can run his mouth, make *home* the space where he has to keep his anger in check, not the other way around.\n\nAnyway, regardless of how they got there, now that the brother is taking the avoidance approach, I do hope things in the house can settle down a bit and everyone gets some room to breathe; the relationship may not improve, but at least there won't be constant screaming, and that can honestly help a lot in itself. Individual therapy will definitely be more helpful for everyone at this point, and maybe after some time has passed, they can test out some just-dad-and-kid sessions with a different counselor. The whole situation is so sad and I wish them the best.", "I can't imagine that the son would think it was anything other than absolute abandonment to be sent to a grandparent's house or something, but I wish that was an option for him. I feel like getting some distance from dad and sister while he processes this in an environment that isn't aggressively antagonistic would help the poor guy", "His son needs to apologize to his daughter. Therapy is not a get out of jail free card for abuse.", "My dad did the same. Haven't had any contact in 20 years. Traded in his family for a new one and didn't need us anymore", "Therapist is obviously there only for the money. He literally told that child that his feelings are not valid. That he doesnt really hate his sister. \nInstead of trying to actually understand the situation he just tries to tell people how they have to feel because its easier.", "Yeah for real. I get not agreeing with the guy, but people are just throwing all their inner daddy demons out at this guy. It's pretty insane.", "Is it me or is aita getting like that? \n\n\"Hes just expressing his feelings\"\n\nUh hes repeatedly telling his sister it's her fault her mother left. That's extremely abusive. She's 16 she cant cope with hearing that. \n\nBut weird reddit thinks if a boy is upset he should be able to hurt a girl while expressing it. How unlike reddit eh?", "Right?  Like I can tell my wife in marriage counseling that I cheated, but she's not allowed to leave me because I said it in a safe space.", "If he can't speak freely, there's no point in the therapy...he'll say what he has to say to end the session, nothing will change and the issues between them will continue.\n\nYou can't work through something you can't verbalise or express.", "Sounds like it\u2019s the mother who\u2019s fucked up both their lives. He just can\u2019t come to terms with the fact that it\u2019s his mothers fault, his mother didn\u2019t love him enough, etc so it is easier to blame his sister because then he can hold onto the idea that his mother is who he thought she was and she loves him, she was just driven away. It\u2019s not right and he\u2019s being awful but it clearly comes from his hurt about his mother abandoning him and therapy should be the place for him to come to terms with that.", "Agreed on both statements. I had to do family therapy when I was a teen with my brother as well and my therapist would NEVER have said that that was an appropriate way to express anything. Sure he\u2019s allowed to have feelings; but he doesn\u2019t get to dump his bad feelings onto his sister in an obviously meant to be cruel way because of a messy divorce. She\u2019s not his black sheep of the family. This therapist does suck. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the grounding part, but the \u201cyou can\u2019t control how you feel\u201d excuse for this is bunk. Sorry for the rant, this just touched a nerve", "I agree totally, I also wonder what the goal of family therapy was? If it was to stop the fighting then it doesn\u2019t matter what the cause was if it can\u2019t be resolved, instead they should be looking for ways to manage/avoid?/cope without fighting and it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019ve made any progress.\n\n\nAlso, Wife didn\u2019t take Son with her- she didn\u2019t love or want the son any more than the daughter.", "My guess is the therapist wanted to let the son express himself first and let him get his grievance out to then work through it, and op's idea of a reaction is to bring down the hammer on the slightest hint of dissent.", "This family needs invidual therapy and a much better family therapist, perhaps one with more experience because surely conflicts where the \u00ab\u00a0actually i don\u2019t love you and think you\u2019re responsible for all my struggles\u00a0\u00bb comes out can\u2019t be all that rare for a family therapist? Especially in the case of very messy family splits.", "yeah, i legit gave a whole body shudder at that \"i know you love your sister\" bit, like wtf. who tf are you to tell someone that you \"know\" how they feel.\n\nand i'm not an expert or anything, but like, what's the point of forcing the brother to love his sister? people don't always love each other even when they're \"supposed\" to, that's not the end of the world. shouldn't the goal be to help him learn how to cope with his negative feelings without actively hurting the sister? it's not like he has to *love* her to do that, he only needs to acknowledge that their mother was an independent adult and her decision to leave was solely hers.", "That\u2019s exactly what a therapist told me, I would frequently say that I didn\u2019t know how I was feeling in difficult situations and they explained that their job wasn\u2019t to tell me how to feel or what my emotions are, but to guide me into asking the right questions to help me put my own words on these feelings, explore how they make me feel, and how to approach the ones I don\u2019t want to have", "I CAN actually see where you're coming from but everyone grieves in their own way and especially for kids, processing that grief can easily take a long time, and it's usually gruelling; even more so when a parent or close family member was lost. He's more likely a hormonal, scared, lost, confused 16 yeat old - who also post a parent. And on a little note that I wanted to throw out there. Depending on how old YOU are, someday you will hit a point and realize that: 1. Maturity is timeless, we mature every day until we die (and no I didn't mean literal physical maturity, either). And 2: Anyone who has ever had siblings can attest that - with pretty few exceptions from what I've seen - that sibling rivalry can be an absolute savage thing.\n\n\nSo with that out of the way and having addressed you very well thought out perspective (seriously, I wouldn't have even considered that at face value). THAT BEING SAID. Therapy is a safe space, it has to be. And that's exactly what the therapist is there for. To mediate, and to help whomever work through how they're feeling; either as an individual or as a collective. The son did the... Umm, natural - for loss of a better term right now - that could be reasonably expected given the circumstances. Understandably the daughter would naturally feel hurt and other things that I can't even imagine. That's terrible. But that is exactly what therapy is for. A good therapist would have helped them establish a rapport, however shaky at the time. And helped them process their feelings both individually and mutually to cultivate a sense of understanding and empathy, and more importantly, to strengthen those family bonds that will always be with us. \n\nSo, for OP to ground the son for working the steps, so to speak;  no matter how tough and ruthless the process and their feelings may be. It's all part of the process - and a 16 year old boy on a good day is still going to be immature and probably a bit of a dick. But issuing punitive justice is only going to foster resentment, stunt emotional growth, and cultivate a sense of distrust and betrayal. All in all, leading to further, potentially more serious issues later on in that young boy's life. The daughter may be hurt but she's also there in therapy to process her emotions and externalize her feelings, which by no means should be expected right away from either kid.\n\n\n**TL;DR OP IS THE AH IF WE REASONABLY EXPECT KIDS TO BE INNATELY EMOTIONALLY IMMATURE LIKE THEY OFTEN ARE. ETH IF WE EXPECT KIDS TO HAVE EMOTIONAL PROCESSING, COMMUNICATION, AND EMPATHY ON PAR WITH THE AVERAGE ADULT** \n\n If anything, OP should have sat down with both kids, and furthered their processing as a family, together on their own. Kids do and say stupid shit all the time. Well into their 20s and 30s, even. You can't take the lazy way. Every moment can be a teachable moment with the right approach and the right mentality.", "I don\u2019t think it was really just for that act. It feels like that was a punishment coming from frustration over the last nine months of fighting. And while I don\u2019t think it was appropriate to do this, the nine months of fighting was basically the son\u2019s fault. So I see how it pieced together in OP\u2019s head. But he did not handle it the right way.", "What the son is doing is basic cognitive dissonance and we all do that from time to time. And with time and work these can be untangled. Can, but not always. It's a mechanism our brains resort to very easily.\n\nThe thing is: OP has to accept that his children went through something so traumatic, this situation may not be mendable. Grounding his son until he's an adult won't do shit. He needs a trauma therapist for both individually and get counseling on how to keep them apart while still ensuring they have some form of social life to at least have distractions in this situation.\n\nA friend of mines father committed murder-suicide when we were teens killing their mom and even 20 years later the kids partly still blame each other. Of course it wasn't their fault, but it's easier to hate somebody that's right there.", "The son is 16, is he, like, mentally disabled? Frankly an extremely stupid point of view to take towards his sister. I get he's not acting rationally and is deeply hurt but this kid is a dope.", "The only way their relationship can heal itself is if the son gets help for his problem. His ADULT Mother left them. His MOTHER is the only one who deserves his blame. It's ridiculous for the son to blame his sister for his Mother's choices. The sister didn't have two kids and abandon them.", "This was my reaction also.  This sounds like an incredibly toxic situation for the daughter especially since her brother is older. Wonder if there's another relative who'd take her in for a while since her brother bullying her is effectively being painted here as \"both sides\" by their parent.", "But it seems like it\u2019s happening actively at home for hours and hours a day all day everyday. That is why they went to therapy. If this girl hurts herself. \n\nI mean what if a kid at school just bullied your kid over and over all day 8 hours a day sometimes even more. Till your kid wanted to die. So you tell a teacher and the bully comes forward and says, \u201cyeah I have a rough home life and it\u2019s okay because I really do think they should die, that\u2019s the truth, can\u2019t fault me because I\u2019m saying what I feel.\u201d", "Literally 90% of the comments are saying to get the kids in individual therapy and it's been driving me insane thank you", "Then drop the family therapy until progress in individual therapy is made.

About how she maybe treated them when alone and things weren't going her way", "I\u2019m glad you see the issue. You would be shocked at how many licensed therapists think this behavior is okay.", "The two are not inversely related. \n\nFucking up the son further \u2260 negating the hurt of the daughter, nor will it stop the son from hurting her more. \n\nThis is not a zero sum hunger game where either kid has to \u201close\u201d for the other to \u201cwin\u201d. \n\n\nJust because people are answering the OP question about the son, doesn\u2019t mean you can swoop in with some BS straw man fantasy that people are saying that \u201csis needs to just suck it up\u201d.", "I so agree with you. The sister seems to be living through hell with this tyrant in her home along with losing her mom, and everyone is all worried about her verbally abusive brother and his \u201csafe\u201d place.

But what everyone is saying is that therapy is one place where they could all productively talk about messy feelings and what's wrong is to punish him for providing an honest reply to the therapist's incorrect statement.\n\nThey (dad and the therapist) should have dealt with it during the session and left it there.", "To be fair the therapist massively rolled the dice by trying to get the son to own up to loving his sister. I don\u2019t think it takes a trained therapist to predict that a hurting child might use that opportunity to lash out. To do that in front of the daughter was a total dick move. If he wanted to try it he should\u2019ve done that in the solo sessions not in the family session. I\u2019m calling shit therapist here.", "Step back for a second and consider how loaded a statement \u201ci know you still love your sister\u201d is. Thats a very stupid thing to say if you\u2019ve gone months with a child who is reacting harshly and with pure anger. \n\nTherapists arent inherently magical infallible psychics. Some are terrible at their jobs. My brother in law nearly divorced his wife from advice given to him. My father before he passed, was convinced to make amends with his ex wife who cheated (thank god we spoke first). \n\nFor any situations not cookie cutter or directly laid out for them, some therapists are quite frankly not qualified and can do more harm than good.", "I agree with you except I think we can cut the dad more slack than that. I agree punishing the son is countrrproductive but theyre all grieving. It wasnt the slightest hint of dissent. Its 9 months of fighting and saying something that hurt the daughter. They all deserve more grace than hyperbole", "I guess it boils down to the son\u2019s delivery, did he express his feelings calmly or did he lash out in a fashion designed to cause hurt. Given that he\u2019s an emotionally wounded child I\u2019m guessing the second, it makes the OPs reaction a bit more understandable in my opinion. I feel that if OP is TA then it\u2019s a soft TA, he\u2019s clearly out of his depth here ( and who wouldn\u2019t be with trying to cope with two children who have been abandoned by their mother) and is falling back on grounding his kids every time they say hurtful things to each other.", "I think that would be a great thing to do (confronting him and saying he must love her) one on one with the kid. But with his younger sister in the room? That just creates issues that she'll have to work through in order to help the brother get through his shit. This is just a bad therapist. You can't hurt a child to help another. These kids aren't ready for family therapy. One on one. And maybe the kids on their own with the father. But not each other.", "My therapist does this after I have a sort of breakthrough. The silence makes me want to talk. So she lets me sit in quiet and I tend to talk more about it and more detail. It helps me work it out on my own in a sense. She stays quiet until I say alright I think I'm done then we discuss it and she asks questions. But I process things out loud.\n\nEdit: made it more clear that I meant from my experience", "Slightest hint of dissent? Get outta here with that absolute bullshit.", "It is concerning how many commentors are saying the therapist is fine. Take the fact that theyve been at it for months with no resolution on its own. Then consider this behavior. OP needs to look elsewhere. This is above the therapists paygrade by virtue of them being unqualified", "> But that is exactly what therapy is for. A good therapist would have helped them establish a rapport, however shaky at the time. And helped them process their feelings both individually and mutually to cultivate a sense of understanding and empathy, and more importantly, to strengthen those family bonds that will always be with us.\n\nNope. A good therapist would protect the daughter from being exposed to such cruelty. That would involve teaching her how to establish boundaries to protect her own mental health and it wouldn't preclude going low to no contact with her brother if she decides that it's too damaging to be around him.\n\nI don't think OP should have grounded his son, but he shouldn't be forcing both siblings into the same therapy session in which the daughter only gets attacked and hurt further. A good therapist should have sensed that and kept sessions individualized until the son is ready to do combined sessions without him hurting her other for no reason other than misplaced hatred.\n\nAnd really, if OP's son refuses to listen to everyone and keeps attacking his sister, then him getting estranged from his sister or even dad is just a natural consequence. I genuinely have yet to hear of a therapist encouraging people to indulge cruelty, but I guess we just might have seen different ones.\n\n>If anything, OP should have sat down with both kids, and furthered their processing as a family, together on their own.\n\nAgain, nope, OP should not have sat down both kids and fostered a session that gives the son room to attack the daughter further. Absolutely not.", "The lack of empathy towards the daughter shows how male dominated this community is.", "That's what the OP's question is about and most comments think the family therapy should stop, for both of their sake.

OP didn\u2019t say that she was in and out of their lives. That\u2019s a different guy.", "That wasn't my concern.  She's not perfect by any means, but she's no monster.  She just thought she wanted kids until she had kids.  Then the sudden dose of reality clued her into it just wasn't what she thought it would be.   \n\nMy concern for the kids was not that I thought she would mis-treat them.  My concern is, I knew she would give parenting minimum effort, as her heart was not in it.  Even if the kids are not abused, is it fair that they are not living with a parent who cares to put effort into raising them????   That was my concern.  That they would be neglected, I guess, for lack of a better term.  But not abused.  \n\nThe point people should take away from this situation.  Think long and hard about having kids or not.  Then when you think the matter is settled, think long and hard again.  And maybe volunteer at a day-care center for a few months, to get a slight taste of your future before you make that final decision.   My wife swore she wanted two kids.  I didn't question her too much, and maybe that was my own failing.  But I knew I wanted kids, and that never changed.

She's the professional. If the therapy truly isn't going anywhere and has just become a space where more damage is being done to the kids, she should have advised them to spend more time in individual counseling before trying again, and given the dad some tips for managing things at home in the meantime. That's her job.\n\nI can't really blame the guy for trusting the person who went through years of study and training for this and has experience working with other families in these situations. This is all new and overwhelming to him; he's grieving too and his family is falling apart in ways he can't control. So of course he thought family therapy would help and wanted to trust the process.\n\nAlso, he did try something else - he's got them all in individual therapy too, and we have no evidence to suggest that *those* sessions aren't helpful to the kids. I'm not sure what other magical solution you think is out there that he just \"shrugged his shoulders\" and didn't bothered to try. This was never going to be fixed overnight. It's just not that simple.\n\nHe's in a situation that I guarantee *most* parents would be way out of their depth in handling. His choice to get the kids into therapy and trust the people with actual expertise in this area was the best choice he could have made at the time.

Teenage bullshit is no joke and no parent should have to shoulder this responsibility all on their own.\n\nIt\u2019s not the right thing to do to punish your son for what he said during therapy-it\u2019s supposed to be a safe place to express feelings and this action might encourage shutting down in therapy- no bueno. But I totally understand your motivation for doing so. Instead, I\u2019d recommend punishing the therapist for setting him up for the outburst- like another commenter said, why was he telling your son how he felt? He WAS setting him up to push back on those feelings.\n\nYour kids are super hurt and don\u2019t know who to blame because the person who is to blame ducked out so this is just chaos. Your ex is a major AH.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty severe punishment though. I don\u2019t think socially isolating your son will do any good for anyone; just more resentment. He needs some space and a break away from the family to connect with peers. One of our jobs as parents is to provide socialization for their psychological development and isolation will bring no good.", "His own therapist said it was s bad idea and dude still thinks he's right...I wish some people didn't have children. These poor kids my heart hurts for them", "Perhaps family therapy happened too soon, and the kids need individual therapy a little longer first. Perhaps your son isn't clicking with his therapist and should try another one. (I think I tried 3 before finding one I was comfortable with.)\n\nAnd if you don't trust your own therapist, then find a new one for yourself too. Thinking you know better than your therapist when you're basically running this ship aground is an asshole move. Did a therapist discuss with you some of the things you should anticipate in the family session? Whoever was running the family session should have given you all an introduction to what the session was for. If the therapist told you all it was a safe place to express yourselves, then you are a triple asshole for punishing your son for his outburst in therapy.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking since reading the title. No one is obligated to love another person: the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb after all. \n\nThats th\u00e9 thing with family therapy, you need to go in prepared to hear the truth, all the truth and nothing but the truth. Not the truth that makes you feel good, not the truth that makes you feel secure, not the truth that is easy. You will hear how people feel exactly even if it hurts a lot, snd the therapist is there to allow those feelings to come out and direct conversations for everyone to understand why everyone feels the way they do.", "I agree YTA but disagree that the son was expressing his feelings to the therapist. Sure the therapist made a comment about potentially loving his sister but the fact that the son stared at the sister when he said it tells me the delivery was strictly for the sister. He said it to hurt her and it was intentional.", "Nevermind hating OP, kids get over that. Now he won't trust therapy as a safe space and will definitely not open up about his feelings (and he can't work through them if he doesn't open up) and won't be open to anything they say in therapy that might help him. Not only that but he's more likely to terrorise his sister in retaliation to his punishment. \n\nOP is right about one thing: his daughter shouldn't have to hear such hurtful things. The best way to fix that is to take them out of family therapy and do therapy separately with each child. The son is not ready to work through his feelings with his sister there. He needs to work on them alone and with OP first. Having his sister  \"forced\" upon him during therapy sessile ns when he obviously has such big (misdirected) feelings probably feels like a punishments to the son in itself and is probably what's stopping the son from making progress in the first place.\n\nTherapy can help a lot but only when done properly. In some cases, when not done well, therapy can actually harm.", "I'm also surprised at the complete lack of nuance here. The comments are all black and white thinking, and don't care about the daughter as anything more than a causality. \n\nHere's my take that in commented elsewhere: \n\nYour son 1) expressed a feeling in therapy (he doesn't love his sister) and 2) said something awful to his sister (you're the reason I don't have a mother) and 3) you grounded him for #2, but he's going to feel like it was #1 and now won't participate in therapy. Like others have said, therapy needs to be a safe place to talk about your feelings, getting punished for that is not good. \n\nHowever\n\nYour daughter 1) was told by her brother that she was the reason their mom left and 2) saw you take a stand against that, which 3) tells her that her brother is wrong, which she needs to know so she can heal \n\n\nSo you're a little stuck. You need to un-ground your son so that he can't be punished for things said in therapy. But you also need to make sure your daughter knows that what your son said *about their mom leaving because of her* is not okay and wrong. \n\nSo, I suggest first: unground your son, but talk to him about how this is because he's not going to be punished for participating in therapy. Tell him he is wrong about why your ex left and that it is not okay for him to blame his sister. \n\nSecond: talk to your daughter about this. Explain why you ungrounded him, but also tell her that it's not her fault and that it isn't okay that her brother *blames her for their mom leaving*\n\nThird: moving forward, *consistently* push back on your son telling your daughter / saying that their mom left because of her. Let him work out his *feelings* towards his sister and mom in individual therapy, but both at home, and at group therapy, just a quick \"No she isn't\" when he accuses your daughter of being the reason their mom left. Basically anything else is on the table. But that idea cannot be seen as supported by your daughter. \n\n\nYour son NEEDS to be told that he has to stop telling his sister it's her fault. And your daughter NEEDS to know that it isn't her fault AND that it's not acceptable for him to say it. And you can do that and still uphold your son's safety of feelings in therapy.", "I agree, these comments blow me away as well. He is 16, he did it to be cruel, he wasn\u2019t just \u201cexpressing his feelings\u201d.", "I\u2019m surprised by these comments too. There\u2019s no perfect way to handle this situation but I can\u2019t imagine being a 14 year old girl (which sucks by itself) and being blamed by your sibling for your mother leaving outright. You already have to contend with your parent\u2019s abandonment but then also be told it\u2019s all your fault? Yeah, therapy is a safe space but words have consequences, even in therapy. Idk that grounding is the answer but can\u2019t do nothing about it\u2026", "I think it's closer to ESH (apart from the daughter, and the therapist wasn't being an asshole but definitely could have handled it better by the sounds of things).\n\nThe son should know better than to say something like that in a way that's intentionally hurtful. If he's just corrected the therapist that's one thing, but directing it at the sister is another thing entirely.\n\nHowever I don't think the punishment really makes sense, it's clear that grounding them in the past hasn't worked, and it sounds like the punishment is causing even more of a rift. I think it would be far more appropriate for this particular incident to be discussed in individual therapy with the son, or maybe a family therapy session without the daughter there. And I think OP needs to think about other conflict resolution techniques rather than trying to punish them by grounding them.", "Yeah, the daughter could escalate to harming herself because she\u2019s been abandoned by her mother and is being abused in her home by her brother everyday to a point where he feels comfortable doing it in front of his dad and another adult but don\u2019t worry everyone he got to express his precious \u2018feelings\u2019.\n\n\nOp needs to protect his daughter and it sounds like he\u2019s grounding son because he\u2019s at the end of his rope with the boy\u2019s behavior.  He\u2019s not grounded for talking in family therapy, he\u2019s grounded for being nasty to his sister and asking nicely hasn\u2019t curbed the behavior.", "Yes. And, he has probably learned he needs to lie in therapy now.", "Exactly my thought. Not to mention it\u2019s suppose to be a safe space for them open up how they feel so they can seek resolution, but instead he gets grounded for doing what\u2019s he\u2019s encouraged to do. Not only would he blame his sister even more but less willingly to express himself in the future.", "Take a step back and see it from your son's POV. His mother has abandoned him, and by grounding him for expressing his feelings, you are also abandoning him. I feel sorry for all of you but mostly to your daughter. What a mess.", "It's a shitty therapist who says, \"I am assigning you feelings \n..\"", "Because sending this child away because he\u2019s suffering his mom abandoning him and his sister is going to help the abandonment issues.", "So, he shares his feelings and the result is his dad sends him away...after his mother abandoned him?\n\nJeez....he'll have issues on his issues.", "I completely agree with all you said. The son blames his sister for losing his mom, and tells her this. It is horribly cruel, insensitive, narcissistic, intentionally wanting to hurt someone else. It\u2019s selfish behaviour. Therapy or not, there shouldn\u2019t be a safe place ANYWHERE to cause someone this much pain. After all his sister lost her mom too. This isn\u2019t all about just him and HIS feelings. \n\nI also agree with boarding school. For a semester at least. If he blames his sister for being there after that period of time he is obviously narcissistic and won\u2019t ever care about anyone else\u2019s feelings ever. There is no hope for this kid and his future. If he does realize how horrid he was to her he\u2019s a good person and will want to fix things. \n\nI hope he\u2019s the later. If he isn\u2019t though, well let\u2019s just say he will require therapy most of his life if he wants to keep any romantic relationships with that selfish attitude. \n\nOP NTA.", "Therapy can be confronting no doubt, but sometimes things need to be said to make progress.", "Therapy is not a place that is guaranteed to have only good things come out. It is, however, a place that is guaranteed to be a space safe enough to say whatever is needed to be said. \n\nYes, the son has been violating the daughter's ability to make positive progress by his actions amd words.

The problem is that dad is on his own and in a shit situation. Idk what I'd do. I pray they find peace.", "If he really feels that way, the place to get it out is with his personal therapist (which they each have one of), not looking his sister in the eye to tell her she\u2019s the reason their mother is gone.

He's already been told, a thousand times. And nothings changed. OP has grounded him for this behavior over and over again. He should understand by now that negative reinforcement does not work.\n\nIf your goal is to find who has the objective moral high ground, then congratulations, you did it. It's not the son. He's the villain and his sister is the victim. Mystery solved. \n\nHowever, if your goal is to actually *solve the problem,* then that doesn't fucking matter. Everyone has already identified his anger issues. Ascribing blame is not the unknown element in this equation.\n\nThe question is, do you want the son to be punished like he deserves, or do you want him to actually improve and stop hurting people? Because right now those two are mutually exclusive. By grounding him in what was supposed to be a safe space, you effectively cut off his only outlet to even start addressing these issues. Ensuring that he will never change.\n\nIf your concern really is \"saving people,\" you have to know that that starts with the person who's causing the problem.", "There's a difference between reprisal and punishment. If you tell your sister you don't love them and blame them for your mom leaving, you should absolutely respect a response from your family. That openness of one person to express their honest feelings and the other person to honestly respond is the whole point here.\n\nBut instead OP just grounds the child.

I almost wonder if OP deliberately shopped around for a therapist that would pressure the boy to parrot OP's feelings instead of letting him feel his own and work through them.

She might be feeling like she ruined everything because of the arguments , but now she must think it\u2019s true that her mom left because of her.

Honestly the moment I read the son's statement I saw red and felt all the blood go straight to my head imagining how that poor girl must've felt.\n\nShe was abandoned too. It doesn't all have to be about son's feelings.

If you punish him for speaking his mind, no matter how hurtful it is, he's not going to be comfortable speaking up during therapy. Honestly, I say YTA, not just for the punishment, but for thinking family therapy would be helpful at the current stage.

There are other people, younger children, with their own feelings. Therapy doesn't give full licence to the person whose feelings are spiteful towards the other to verbally abuse them, while the other just puts up with it because it's therapy and that's what they (at 14) signed up for. Reddit seems to have taken a nice-sounding principle and followed it through dogmatically to a moronic outcome.\n\nSo you'd be right to let your son know that he was wrong to say things like that to your sister.

Even if he doesn\u2019t come around, perhaps she will. You can still do a lot of damage control to rebuild these relationships if you start reaching out with love, instead of reacting with anger. I didn\u2019t go no-contact with my family until I was 30. I gave them so, so many chances. Your son doesn\u2019t need punishment, he needs to work this out in his individual therapy. Your daughter needs to know that you love her. That\u2019s it. Because I can promise you that right now, she doesn\u2019t feel that a soul in this world does.", "Except it wasn\u2019t to ****his**** therapist, it was to their group therapist ****with his sister present****.\n\nYou\u2019re clearly not reading the OP, no, he can\u2019t contact the mother, she\u2019s absent.\n\nNow you\u2019re wanting the father to make the mother tell the son she doesn\u2019t want him as a kid.\n\nThat\u2019s messed up.", "Sounds like mom wants nothing to do with them and wouldn't be surprised if she's completely changed all contact info and even isolated anyone that could be used to get in contact with her.", "He didn't though. He expressed his feelings to his sister. Even though a therapist was in the room, he told his sister to her face that he hates her. \n\nDad is in a catch 22. He either lets the son be a fucking asshole to his sister forever and the sister hates the father or he stops his son from being an absolute monster to his sister. \n\nUltimately, I think OP is correct over the therapist. The girl has to live with constant accusations that this is all her fault. Has to be verbally abused by her brother because the kid can't see past the fact that regardless of whether or not it's true, it doesn't matter. \n\nOP is in the right. His son either stops being a demon to his sister, or he absolutely can hate the dad. You have to pick in this one. Who are we supporting here? The son who can't control himself or the daughter who is being persecuted in her own home? \n\nIt's easy for me. The kid needs to grow up.", "OP is in the wrong because he\u2019s forcing his kids into family therapy before they\u2019re ready for it and then punishing one of them for the inevitable consequences of that. You can\u2019t force family therapy but OP just wants to speed run the the healing process, and the family therapist is in the wrong for clearly being under qualified and still advertising family therapy services.\n\nOP needs to unground their son, take both kids out of family therapy and keep them in individual therapy until they\u2019re actually ready, or all that\u2019s going to happen is things are going to keep making things worse.", ">if he was just venting he could've done that there\n\nIn the version of events I read, he was directly responding to the therapist stating the opposite.

I wish OP had said more about what the siblings relationship was like before mum took off. I sort of wonder with all this vitriol, if the son hasn't always been jealous of his sister and now he finally has a \"good excuse\" to be open about it. \n\nWhile OP needs to make it clear that all of this is entirely on their mother and placing the blame and being abusive towards his kid sister is not acceptable, I agree with you that grounding is not the way to go, the boy will probably just blame that on his sister too and resent her even more.  \n\nUnfortunately the boy seems to be stuck in this mindset and probably entirely unwilling to even consider that it is his mum who is an AH who CHOSE to abandon her kids!

He just can\u2019t accept it - it\u2019s too painful.  So he is desperately trying to believe that his mom was a victim - forced into leaving by his sister being difficult.  If he can convince himself that she was forced into leaving then he can also convince himself of all sorts of things much less painful than the truth.  \n\nShe still wants him.  She still loves him.  She didn\u2019t want to leave him.  She was just forced into it because his sister was being difficult.  She\u2019d be here with him even now if his little sister wasn\u2019t such a brat.  \n\nThose things as SO much less painful than the truth.  She doesn\u2019t want him.  She doesn\u2019t love him.  She wanted to leave him.  She wasn\u2019t forced into anything because she\u2019s an adult.  She wouldn\u2019t be with him now even if his sister was a saint.  \n\nThe truth is extremely painful.  He\u2019s not dealing with it in a healthy way.  He\u2019s being cruel to his little sister to try to mitigate his own pain.  That\u2019s super toxic behavior - especially when visited upon another child already in pain.  \n\nHis pain doesn\u2019t excuse his cruelty & daughter shouldn\u2019t be subjected to it.
