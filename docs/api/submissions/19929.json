About nine months ago, my wife decided she never wanted to be a mother, divorced me, and basically signed away her rights to the kids, we get child support and that's it. Obviously this has been extremely hard on them, and I have them in bothqq individual and family therapy to try and help them worth through this.\n\nThe issue is my son blames his sister. She's sometimes you're typical moody teen, even though she's really a wonderful kid. Her and her mother had been fighting a lot before she left, and my son thinks despite me and two therapists telling him otherwise that she's responsible for it. They've been fighting constantly, destroying eachothers stuff and constantly screaming at eachother. They've probably spent 3/4ths of the past nine months grounded for this.\n\nFamily therapy hasn't been going well because of this. My son refuses to engage when it comes to his sister, and won't hear any talk that this isn't her fault. Things finally blew up two weeks ago, when the family therapist was at least trying to bring him down from fighting with her. The therapist basically said something like \"I know you still love your sister-\" and my son cut him off and said \"No I don't, I'd still have a mother if it wasn't for her.\" While looking right at her.\n\nThe session was more or less over after that, none of us knew what to say and my daughter looked so broken. When we left I told my son he's grounded full stop until the new school year starts, no phone, no friends, nothing. Things have been even worse at home, he won't even acknowledge she exists, and will leave the room if she enters. My own therapist said this was a mistake to punish him for speaking his mind, but I don't think he should be allowed to be so hurtful", "created_utc": 1687044341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14c525u/aita_for_grounding_my_son_after_he_told_his/", "score": 299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

About nine months ago, my wife decided she never wanted to be a mother, divorced me, and basically signed away her rights to the kids, we get child support and that's it. Obviously this has been extremely hard on them, and I have them in bothqq individual and family therapy to try and help them worth through this.\n\nThe issue is my son blames his sister. She's sometimes you're typical moody teen, even though she's really a wonderful kid. Her and her mother had been fighting a lot before she left, and my son thinks despite me and two therapists telling him otherwise that she's responsible for it. They've been fighting constantly, destroying eachothers stuff and constantly screaming at eachother. They've probably spent 3/4ths of the past nine months grounded for this.\n\nFamily therapy hasn't been going well because of this. My son refuses to engage when it comes to his sister, and won't hear any talk that this isn't her fault. Things finally blew up two weeks ago, when the family therapist was at least trying to bring him down from fighting with her. The therapist basically said something like \"I know you still love your sister-\" and my son cut him off and said \"No I don't, I'd still have a mother if it wasn't for her.\" While looking right at her.\n\nThe session was more or less over after that, none of us knew what to say and my daughter looked so broken. When we left I told my son he's grounded full stop until the new school year starts, no phone, no friends, nothing. Things have been even worse at home, he won't even acknowledge she exists, and will leave the room if she enters. My own therapist said this was a mistake to punish him for speaking his mind, but I don't think he should be allowed to be so hurtful\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s far less likely that him blaming his sister is irrational and unfounded than there is actually some truth to this and your wife\u2019s relationship with her daughter was a point of conflict in the family for a long time before she left.

It might have been better to have your son to just do individual therapy instead of family therapy until he is in a better place mentally.\n\nI am sure it has been enormously difficult these past 9 months.

You need to tell him that almost all (exceptions to every rule) mother's and daughters have tension around the teen years BUT that most mothers don't leave. While you understand he is hurt and he can't be angry at his mom because in his heart he is hoping she comes back and he doesn't want to make her angry it is not OK to use his sister as his emotional punching bag.

Your decision to punish him in this situation is also going to make any future meaningful family therapy very unlikely because he will not feel safe enough to be vulnerable and share his true feelings.\n\nAlso, you mention they\u2019ve both spent most of the time since mom leaving grounded. You do realize by grounding them you are taking away most of their coping tools and support network right?

I am not reading anything that indicates they are ready to be in family therapy together.\n\nI am actually okay with the idea of taking phones/grounding, but I think it should be shorter term and you should target the very worst behaviors they are showing. You mention they are constantly screaming/fighting/destroying each other's stuff.\n\nSo I'd set the rules that if there is any fighting/screaming, they both lose their phones/electronics for the next 24 hours and are also grounded for the next 24 hours. Make it immediate and attached to the specific behavior, but also over quickly, so they have the opportunity to earn back privileges through better choices. If someone destroys someone's stuff, they are grounded/lose electronics for 72 hours and also have to pay for it from their own allowance (and if they don't get an allowance, find nasty chores they can do to earn the money--scrubbing bathrooms, mowing the lawn, cleaning the oven, weeding the garden.) They don't get their electronics back until the chores are completed successfully.\n\nBut I would not ground your son for what he said in therapy because I think one has to be allowed to say the truth in therapy even if it is awful.

Does she have any contact with any of you? \n2. What do the therapists suggest doing to root out this delusion in your son's mind? There are lots of psychological reasons a child won't blame his parents for things they deserve blame for. (Kids need parents to survive, so rather than blame the parents, kids will sometimes blame themselves or in this case their siblings when parents rightly deserve the blame.) Does your son's therapists have any suggestions for how to get your son to acknowledge that this was his mother's choice and not the fault of him or his sister?\n3. I hate the idea of tearing up the stability of your children's home further than it has already been, but is this bullying/fighting getting so destructive that it will cause long-term harm to your daughter to the point that they need to live in separate homes (with grandparents, etc?)\n4.

I think obviously medication isn\u2019t a first choice, but this boy is struggling and needs some help.", "That wasnt as badly as he could, he coulda did other things to hurt her. HES IN THERAPY, the point of therapy is to get help so your therapist needs to listen to you, whats the point of trying to get ur kid help and then punishing them when they are participating during therapy", "Its common sense that ugly things can happen during therapy ESPECIALLY since the awful situation they are in, so why punish ur kid", "Because she didn\u2019t try to maintain a relationship with the son. This is an adult who is not capable or willing.  We don\u2019t know which but in any case it is not a child\u2019s responsibility.", "Because that's a wrong opinion which affects the household and he should reconsider. Since he can't keep the opinion for himself then he must change it.", "Thank you.  What really smarted (at first) was knowing my children would be raised by a person who didn't love them and was only keeping them for financial gain.  (OUCH!!!)  But the children were too young to process what was really going on, and even if they had been older...\n\nI wouldn't have been stupid enough to clue them in.  I mean, can you imagine the psychological damage if you learn that your own mother doesn't love you and resents you for burdening her?  I asked my lawyer to sue for full custody.  I was advised not to.  The way he put it, this will drag out for many years, and cost you hundreds of thousands in legal fees.   And in the end, you have a penis, so you lose...\n\nNow SINCE THAT TIME, winds are changing.  I understand that NOW, family courts are a bit less hostile in mis-treating fathers.  (although they still mistreat fathers).  But when I filed for divorce ages ago, I believe my very expensive and successful family law attorney gave me good advice.  Unwelcome advice isn't necessarily bad advice.  He wasn't going to tell me what I wanted to hear.  He was telling me how fucked I'd get if I did the right thing.  Sigh...\n\nIt all turned out OK.  My ex managed to act like she gave a shit.  So my kids survived.  Years later, she re-married a guy who I have a ton of respect for.  He's a great role-model to both my kids, and takes an active interest in raising them.  Spends a lot more time and effort with my kids than their mom does.  Not surprisingly.  \n\nSo the kids are thriving.  They have my money and a good father (even if he didn't provide the genes)  Their mom works 80+ hours a week, probably just to get away from the kids.  The house has three incomes, the two fathers alone provide more than enough income....she wouldn't need to work.  But she does.  ALL. THE. TIME.  If I ever need to talk to her, I have to make an appointment, as she's never home...\n\nBoth kids are straight A students and participate in many sports and other activities outside of school.   All's well that ends well, I guess.  I got pushed out of their lives (tragically) but nothing I could do short of over-hauling the family court system.  But that would be even above my pay grade (which is high).", "Sorry, someone willing to punish for things said in therapy does not need to be looking to medicate the hurting teen. I can just see this turning into the Ritalin issues where parents drugged their kids for school to make them compliant. Dad already wants compliance instead of honesty.", "It\u2019s toxic to the body", "No it isn\u2019t. They destroy your liver.", "Biased,  absolutely. Considering I retired from the field...\n\nBaseless, not so much. He wants his son to stop being hurtful. Not that he wants his son to heal, shown by grounding him for honesty in therapy. Heck, according to him both kids have been grounded 3/4 of the time since the egg donor left. That's over six months out of the nine she's been gone. He's not looking to make them better, or he would have already accepted grounding ain't working and tried different tactics.\n\nMeds are fine. I'm not going against them. I'm against a parent who's not working on doing what both kids need.", "that's fare however i do believe medication will make things worse overall", "Dude, cool your jets and get off the caps locks.", "If he isn\u2019t allowed to express his feelings openly, what was the point of going to therapy?", "The mother part is wrong, but the son shouldn't be forced to say he loves his sister before he works through his misplaced anger. OP should reiterate that his sister isn't responsible for their mother leaving, but also that his true feelings for his sister will come out on his own terms and nobody else's. That therapy will no longer be an excuse to bully him into loving his sister, that his feelings matter too.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s really not.", "Oh my gosh not another anti vaxxer", "Alcohol destroys your liver when abused. Acetaminophen destroyes your liver when abused. Too much oxygen causes cell damage. Too much water causes water intoxication. The list of things that harm you when abused or too much is consumed goes on and on. A blanket statement saying medication is bad is misinformed, biased, and flat ignorant.\n\nIt's about dosage and that's what the doctor writing the prescription is for", "My response was to the statement demonizing medication, not what you're referring to", "He doesn't express his feelings, he yells and cusses and whatever and repeats the same thing over and over, it has to stop, either he keep his opinion for himself either change it why harm the psychology of everyone in the house? The sister is innocent, why does she have to live through this. Stop focusing on the son, it's the sister who gets more damaged from this", "The son needs to hear it from both parents and especially the mother that the sister is not responsible. It seems as they haven't told him the truth and for some reason in his mind, the sister is responsible for everything.", "Your take is bad. OP NTA", "Gotcha. My apologies for conclusion jumping.", "I mean, they are in therapy to change his opinion and heal the house. To be able to change how he feels, they have to talk through this shit no matter how much it hurts the other family members.\n\nYou can\u2019t ground him because he is talking about how he feels in something he more than likely isn\u2019t wanting to go to either. \n\nMaybe OP should focus on healing the family, not grounding his son for using therapy for its literal intended purpose.", "No worries. I'd be jumping on anyone making a blanket statement trashing therapy and medication. If fact, I did lol", "Therapy isnt going well either, this doesn't need therapy but this mother to act as mother for 5 mins and explain herself to the son. The son is emotionally attached to her, only she can convince him."]}
