Yes, we've actually talked about his weaponized incompetence and for a while, he was doing better - not automatically saying, \"Well, you're just better at it than I am.

Yes, totally. \n\nIs it in any way constructive to just remove the bucket from the sink when you wash the dishes, instead of at any point telling him you dont want to wash something you didnt use? Is it helpful to respond to him noting that you dont want to wash it by passive aggressively putting it on the side and silently leaving the room?

His bucket. His problem.", "Rather than being passive-aggressive, why didn't you ASK him to wash his own bucket after he cuts the lawn and vacuums and then helps you make the beds and clean OR my preference, pay someone to come in and clean your house, order your groceries online in the comfort of your home, have the other two people that you're slaving/cooking for contribute, etc.?

I turned things around, but it took a while. Best to start with making things explicit I think. A full list and open conversation about who does what. Obvious word of warning though, the US at least has a pretty unfair cultural background, and your husband may or may not be onboard with switching things up. For the sake of the marriage though, you do need to get to a place where you're not letting resentment build and doing little passive aggressive dances like this, it's way too \"Everyone Loves Raymond\". It's not a good look for either of you.

Does he get a sticker on a chore chart like a kid? \"Not his chore\" is bullshit. He's a grown man living in the house. He dirtied the dish. He wants it clean. He can wash it.

Apparently, according to others, OP has stated it wasn't a discussed division of labor, but rather a case of he won't do it, so to make sure they are living in a clean and usable space, she does it. Both people use dishes, and so do the children. In this instance, it should be a split labor chore, but it isn't. So she chose not to wash the one dish that she never uses. It's not like she's not washing his dinner bowl. She's not washing HIS popcorn bucket that HE paid for so that HE can occasionally get free/cheaper popcorn. HE is the only one who eats from it. \n\nTell me how it is HER responsibility to wash HIS popcorn bucket?
