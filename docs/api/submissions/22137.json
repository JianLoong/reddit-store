All of your comments sound super misogynistic.", "Not even remotely.", "i think i will ask you\u2026 are you 12 ?", "Human. Earth. \n\nYou live somewhere you help take care of the household. Period.", "Thank you for this point, as well. When he first started buying these buckets, we had a whole separate argument about whether or not it would be worth it to buy since he never went to the movies (nor did I, for that matter). The first year he bought one, he only went back to fill it twice. It's an annoying piece of plastic that rarely gets used and is just in the way.", "I'm sorry, I just don't see how a reusable plastic dish doesn't count. It's not meant to be thrown away like bottle caps or intended as a one-time use like Cool Whip. They're reusable on purpose. Like the big plastic movie theater cups that I wash. Refusing to classify them as dishes is petty", "Yuck. Yuck yuck yuck. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so fat!!! I have a slow metabolism!", "We do both work full-time. Yes, we've actually talked about his weaponized incompetence and for a while, he was doing better - not automatically saying, \"Well, you're just better at it than I am. I just suck at doing that.\" But here lately, there's been much less trying on his part to help keep the household taken care of.", "I'm female", "And then top it off with a blow job!", "You really sound like a 12 year old\n\nActually that\u2019s a bit harsh to the 12 year olds", "That\u2019s so clever!!!  Wow!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "So you're mad he even buys them because you don't think they're worth it, and that's why you won't wash them. It's petty but he can wash them himself. ESH", "Yeah, if you come home with one of those half-gallon drive through cups and tell me I have to hand-wash it because the dishwasher will melt it then I'm going to:\n\n1) Start laughing because I assume you're fucking with me.\n2) Start laughing uncontrollably when I realize you're not.", "And that's why I made an \"if\" statement", "Then yeah, your husband sounds misogynistic.", "No, I've never been mad about. I understand he enjoys his popcorn and feel that he should be able to enjoy it when he wants to. I get slightly annoyed by the bucket taking up space but it is easily placed somewhere out of sight. I don't like popcorn. Never eat it.", "OP clarified this BEFORE you made your \"if statement\". It wasn't an \"if\" any more.\n\nETA: and when you make an if statement, you should expect people to clarify what the actual situation is..."]}
