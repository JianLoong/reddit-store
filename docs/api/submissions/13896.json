There are some pairs of thongs that I specifically remember owning that are just no longer in my possession anymore. Which is unsettling and it creeps me out and puts me on edge. I\u2019m thorough too, I look and check everywhere. Plus you can tell when a drier is opened before you get there because \u201cEnd\u201d on the screen goes blank. \n\n2. Because it can get crowded sometimes, people get ridiculously impatient if someone doesn\u2019t tend to their laundry quickly enough when it\u2019s done.

I\u2019m already on edge because of the stuff going missing in the past. On top of that, there were FOUR open driers that he could be using. He snapped back at me and told me that I\u2019m using the best drier and I\u2019m hogging it. His demeanor was jittery, had a nervous tick while being rather hostile. I told him to leave my laundry alone and that I don\u2019t appreciate some stranger touching my clean clothes/underwear. He stormed out while muttering some unintelligible insults. The biggest red flag I realized was he stormed out and he wasn\u2019t even DOING LAUNDRY!\n\nI immediately called the management office to report the incident and I mentioned that I felt unsafe especially since he lives a few doors down.

I really hope your management looks into this because his demeanour makes it seem like there could be something malicious happening.. Like his unnecessarily hostile behaviour seems a little concerning?", "NTA. I'd be pissed. You should start recording in situations like these from now on. You might need it if this continues. Hopefully being caught will be enough.", "NTA. A 30+ year old man, throwing around your laundry for no reason but a bad excuse, after you noticed that some of your UNDERWEAR went missing?? That's so fucking creepy. Please call again, hope to ring up someone else and keep pushing. If you ever get any at least semi-solid evidence I'd suggest calling the police if the management refuses to do anything", "Definitely NTA. I\u2019d probably start making sure you get back to the dryer before it\u2019s done. Even if you have to wait a few minutes. Ask the management if there are cameras in the laundry room as well. They have to tell you if you are being recorded. If you walk in and he\u2019s messing with your laundry again, I\u2019d also record the whole incident (just check your local laws on recording, some states are pretty strict.)", "NTA.  I can only suggest  that when you do laundry, you make sure to return before its finished and sit with a book for 10 or 15 minutes.\n\nAs for management, them shrugging it off is just lazy because they dont know what else to do.  Id report any further losses to the police, and let management know that you will be doing so, and letting them know that management refused to take any actions so you were left with no alternative.", "NTA\n\nCreepers gonna creep. Management dismissing this as kindergarten stuff is part of the problem.", "NTA - obviously management don't want to get involved because he's a creep and they don't want to talk to him, so they pretend you're being petty. Tell them if they won't talk to the offender now, you'll ask them to put cameras in the laundry rooms as your possessions are being stolen. If they're still not acting, report the theft to the police. They probably won't do anything, especially if you don't have hard evidence and probably won't be able to determine how much has been stolen, but it's important to report it now because if it happens again, they'll be much more likely to help. Even if the police don't want to help for \"underwear theft\" simply for logistics, they'll be more keen to take action when something is a repeating cycle than an isolated incident, because they don't want to have to take a report from you every few weeks. \n\nMaybe no harm in reporting to the police anyway even if the management company do talk to the guy.", "NTA, but management isn't necessarily being an asshole.... yet. If you don't have any evidence that it's definitely him stealing panties, what do you expect them to do? How do they know you're not being vindictive/pointing the finger at some guy based on false assumptions? \n\nCould you talk to management about installing CCTV in the laundry room as you're concerned about washing going missing? \n\nWhen people chuck the laundry out of a washer, it can fall down places, so you'd need to eliminate angry throwing of washing as the culprit. Bagging your underwear (in a delicates laundry bag) and having a record of which ones were bagged and what came out of the bag would make it very obvious if one does go missing. \n\nHe could be the panty stealer, or he could just be the washing police weirdo - one unsettling, one annoying. But unless you have evidence of panty stealage and who it is, I'm not sure the management can do a right lot.", "ESH it was really weird for him to be moving clothes out of the dryer when he isnt doing any laundry at all. \n\nBut you have to cut your bullshit there is no reason that your laundry should be sitting in a machine after it is finished. You have a phone, that phone has an alarm, set your alarm and get your laundry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I honestly was going to say you were TA at first even though it was only 5 minutes, but if there were open dryers and he didn\u2019t even have laundry ready to go in, he\u2019s definitely up to something.", "NTA - You should let the management office know you'll start calling the police instead. Either that'll spur them to take a little action on their own...or it's a sign you actually SHOULD call the police if you suspect something has stolen your things.", "NTA", "NTA you need to document it in writing to management. Explaining he was going through your laundry with other dryers being empty and he didn't have any laundry with him. That you already have smalls missing and his behaviour was odd. Otherwise they could deny you ever made a report. You can also spend time wording it correctly, so they cannot dismiss it as a school yard petty issue.", "NTA.  It sounds like you caught the panty thief in the act.\n\n>Plus you can tell when a drier is opened before you get there because \u201cEnd\u201d on the screen goes blank.\n\nFYI: I have a drier like this in my house.

But, in a shared laundry room, having your stuff moved when it's done is a thing, and grace periods aren't really a thing.  We have too many people who leave stuff in a machine for hours and hours.  So, that part, you have to accept.\n\nBut, this dude wasn't using the machine, which crosses a lot of lines and is suspect as hell.\n\nSo, NTA for raising a stink.\n\nI used to work as assistant super in my building, and this sort of thing came up.

I bought it and a drying rack at my last apartment because I was never given a key to the laundry room. Even now that I'm in different building with a key, there's only 1 washer + dryer and I can't be arsed to constantly check if it's available (or get a bunch of quarters). It's an absolute lifesaver, and I use my local laundromat's pickup & delivery service for bulky blankets that won't fit. There are even smaller countertop ones meant just for undergarments that are cheaper than the one I linked to."]}
