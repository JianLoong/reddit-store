He's cancer and is terminal. My fiance wanted to take him on a vacation for a couple of days and begged me to basically fund it. I refused although I felt incredibly guilty after he made me feel bad about it for days!\n\n\nEventually, he was able to borrow money to go on the vacation. They went and spent 2 days at a sports city. When it was time to return, he called me asking me to pay for their plane tickets to get home. I was taken aback I asked why I should pay and he said because they ran out of money and didn't put any aside to get home. I refused and told him it wasn't my problem he didn't save money for the return flight. He started arguing with me saying I can't let them be stranded in another city when I have the means to help, especially after I refused to help fund the vacation. I said no and that he needed to deal with it on his own. He didn't stop texting me trying to get me to pay. He and his friend had to eventually return by road and it took them 8+ hrs.\n\n\nHe came home and blew up saying I let them be stranded in snother city and refused to help although I had money to pay for their plane tickets. He said that by \"forcing\" them to travel by road, I had caused his friend unnecesary exhaustion and turmoil. He called me every name under the sun and said I had no empthay for his friend and that I'd tainted the memories of this vacation.\n\n\nAITA? He's still mad at me and says he's in shock by the way I behaved in this situation and lack of empathy I'd displayed.\n\n\nI need to mention something as a number of people have been asking about it. My fiance is unemployed that's why he could not afford the vacation although it wasn't expensive. I'm the one working. Money is tight and yes, paying for the ticket would have strapped me financially since I'm paying for everything.", "created_utc": 1667684884, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn7ak1/aita_for_letting_him_and_his_guy_friend_be/", "score": 8690, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lololol. Unless this is fake/rage-bait, you really need to reconsider everything. This man doesn\u2019t love you and you need to see this, because this relationship is going to be even more damaging for you as time goes by. And you don\u2019t deserve this. Let me make it more clear for you. The facts are:\n\na) He made you feel guilty for not funding his holiday (that *he* should have funded) when it was NOT a necessity and you\u2019re not even close to being rich. He\u2019s also unemployed and it seems that he doesn\u2019t contribute to anything, mainly as a partner, I\u2019d guess.\n\nb) He sprung paying for plane tickets, which is a major expense, on you last minute even though it is typically one\u2019s *main* responsibility to make arrangements for their return before they even go to a place. So he demanded you spend your money for something almost *every person* tries to ensure (their return) before they travel *anywhere*. This is suspicious.\n\nc) Based on the above info, it can be deduced that your fianc\u00e9 tried, in a calculated move, to *make you* pay for his plane tickets out of spite for you not paying for the original vacation. He did it either because he didn\u2019t want to borrow extra money from someone else (because he expected that he wouldn\u2019t need to return the money you\u2019d give him, had you funded his trip) or, he *wanted to put you* in this situation as a way to test your willingness to help him (and your boundaries).\n\nd) When you made your boundaries clear once more, he called you names for your refusal to accommodate his last minute demands, and claimed you have no empathy and ruined their experience. He pinned the blame of his irresponsible and spiteful actions on you, and basically slammed you for not accepting to be manipulated by him. \n\nYou need to understand that you did nothing wrong here whatsoever. You were trying to be reasonable during a time of financial hardship and, in any case, you do not owe him anything financially. He\u2019s the one who is in the wrong, lacks empathy, and acts spitefully because he didn\u2019t get what he wanted. He wanted to do something nice for his friend, which is good, and I\u2019m sorry for his friend\u2019s situation, but he tried doing so by stepping on your struggles and fully disrespecting you. And now, he\u2019s insulted you, and is trying to assassinate your character and make you feel bad, so you will bend to his will because of your guilt. Please don\u2019t let him do this to you. This is toxic, cruel and wrong. A loving partner does not act this way. I don\u2019t know if he has always been like this, or if his grief for the imminent loss is making him act completely insane, but this cannot go on and you can\u2019t let him be like that with you. \n\nSide note: I apologise in advance for the \u201crage-bait\u201d comment in case this story is real, but seriously, there are way, way too many stories in the AITA subreddit with \u201cfianc\u00e9s\u201d being \u201cunemployed\u201d and yet still wanting and making arrangements for luxuries and demanding money from their partners, and often, more specifically to \u201chelp friends with cancer feel better\u201d. In all seriousness, I can\u2019t understand how this could have become a thing and how someone could think it\u2019s okay to demand such things from their partner when the partner has already clearly refused and when they\u2019re in a difficult financial position. I cannot believe there are so many people out there who have such insane demands and expectations and are manipulative and cruel to their partners who they even asked to marriage. It seems too absurd.", "What bugs me is that both the fiance and the friend KNOW he is unemployed. So to have the audacity to arrange a vacation in a sports city (which typically will be more expensive than a normal, boring place) knowing he has no funds astounds me.
