He's cancer and is terminal. My fiance wanted to take him on a vacation for a couple of days and begged me to basically fund it. I refused although I felt incredibly guilty after he made me feel bad about it for days!\n\n\nEventually, he was able to borrow money to go on the vacation. They went and spent 2 days at a sports city. When it was time to return, he called me asking me to pay for their plane tickets to get home. I was taken aback I asked why I should pay and he said because they ran out of money and didn't put any aside to get home. I refused and told him it wasn't my problem he didn't save money for the return flight. He started arguing with me saying I can't let them be stranded in another city when I have the means to help, especially after I refused to help fund the vacation. I said no and that he needed to deal with it on his own. He didn't stop texting me trying to get me to pay. He and his friend had to eventually return by road and it took them 8+ hrs.\n\n\nHe came home and blew up saying I let them be stranded in snother city and refused to help although I had money to pay for their plane tickets. He said that by \"forcing\" them to travel by road, I had caused his friend unnecesary exhaustion and turmoil. He called me every name under the sun and said I had no empthay for his friend and that I'd tainted the memories of this vacation.\n\n\nAITA? He's still mad at me and says he's in shock by the way I behaved in this situation and lack of empathy I'd displayed.\n\n\nI need to mention something as a number of people have been asking about it. My fiance is unemployed that's why he could not afford the vacation although it wasn't expensive. I'm the one working. Money is tight and yes, paying for the ticket would have strapped me financially since I'm paying for everything.", "created_utc": 1667684884, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn7ak1/aita_for_letting_him_and_his_guy_friend_be/", "score": 463, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who buys only one way of the ticket unless they plan on someone else covering the return.", "Are you the boyfriend? Because I\u2019m getting that vibe. The boyfriend intentionally ended up in the situation. Sure, let\u2019s call it an intentional mistake. People need to learn from their mistakes. He wasn\u2019t stranded, he just didn\u2019t want to take the cheaper/longer way home, which he ended up doing because of his mistake. OP has ever right to protect their finances when they\u2019re the one who pays for everything. The boyfriend could of taken friend to the park or camping and had just as good of a time for virtually free but instead he expected OP to pay which they didn\u2019t have money for. Not OPs fault. \nNTA, OP. I hope you realize this isn\u2019t going to be the only time this happens. He will do this again and continue to make you feel bad.", "OP had a nice, shiny spine on them. I hope they don\u2019t back down.", "My POV stems from caring for the sick friend, not the BF putting them into the situation. The NICE thing to do, if you're not going to hurt from it, would have been to get them home and then deal with it then. Like I've mentioned on other replies, my health issues would put me in bed for days if I had to ride in a car for 8+ hours. I'm not saying OP should have done it for the BF, but for the friend. The friend was probably told all along it was all taken care of and I'm sure it wasn't good for his health to stress about this. It would have just been easier to get them home and then deal with the BF as opposed to stranding them when the OP says several times they wouldn't have been hurting if they paid for plane tix.", "Gotcha. Makes sense. The several people I know that travel to LV also drive there often, bring their kids sometimes and have multiple cars so they can decide spontaneously whether they want round trip or to drive. And honestly, my whole POV comes from sympathy for the sick friend, not the BF who got them all into the situation.", ".....\n\nop male fiance who asks for the return trip money, the one who went on the trip with his sick friend, does not have money.\n\nnormally that would be to bad, no vacay, safe money first. normally... but the best friend is dying, so no time for that. \nHence offering to at least borrow the money to fiance is a good option, if he is normally reliable. We do not know if for instance the original return fight got cancelled. lack off emphaty for the situation makes them both suck. \n\nIf fiance is always irrisponsable with money, why marry. if you care more about money then your fiance, why marry? if you have no trust he pays you back, that is just pointless.", "Sorry. But that is not what a mistake is. \nI've had to explain this to so many students over the years. I have noticed people mess up the words mistake and excuse a lot. \n\nMistake definition...\n\nan action or judgment that is misguided or wrong.\n\n\n*it doesn't say anything about being intentional or not.", "No. I just know how to love a person.\n\nYou can help a person learn from their mistake and still show love. \n\nStranding a partner is not showing love.", "First of all it's lend money. Second of all you're just repeating what I said. It's about OP and the boyfriend. You're hung up on the friend, which my comment wasn't about.", "But \u201cmisguided\u201d implies someone doesn\u2019t know better. I can\u2019t punch someone in the face and say \u201coops that was a mistake\u201d\u2026 I know what I am doing is wrong and so doing it is intentional."]}
