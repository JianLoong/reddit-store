It was a rough month and my husband and I as well as our 1 year old spent the whole time with his family. I cancelled our Christmas plans with my family a few days out from Christmas as she didn\u2019t want to spend that period in the house. Completely understandable so we booked a last minute Airbnb elsewhere. I felt I was very understanding and supported my husband and his family the best I could. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks out from Easter. I asked my husband if we could stay 1 night at my Dads and the other 3 nights with his Mum. He at that stage agreed. My sister and her family had been living with my Dad for 2.5 years so we hadn\u2019t been able to stay with him and he was really keen for us to come stay a night.\n\nIt comes the week of Easter and I mention again about staying a night at my Dads and he says \u201cwe will see\u201d. I replied that I thought it would be rude not to as he and my sister had gone to a lot of trouble to get the rooms sorted so we could stay (she literally moved out that month). The day that we were meant to stay at my Dads he told me he wasn\u2019t coming and would come join me later the next day for my family brunch for Easter Sunday. \n\nI felt uncomfortable explaining to my Dad why he wasn\u2019t there and was trying to understand why he wouldn\u2019t want to be with us. His brother, wife and child live with his Mum and we had seen them monthly since Dec. Twice she had come and stayed with us.\n\nAITA? It has caused some tension as every time we go home we stay and spend more time with his family even before his Dads passing. My side are really polite about it but I know it\u2019s starting to annoy them that I spend more time with his family.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the responses so far. I lost my Mum when I was 13 so feel like I\u2019m doing an okay job of being understanding and supportive. We live 5 hours away from both sides and his Mum lives 20 mins from my Dads.

He was elderly, declining health and we all received his passing as a blessing. Then Christmas, FIL birthday, husband\u2019s birthday, parents anniversary and Easter\u2026each time it was *this is the first of many without him* and frankly, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going through and how he\u2019s processing and what tidal waves of emotion hit and how hard. \n\nI am not a tit for tat person, but in my heart I have built a bank of care and love and support against which I plan to withdraw when the time comes for me to process my own parental losses.\n\nWould you not want that same breadth of love and grace in the loss of your parent? \n\nYou have every right to be annoyed and that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. But I do hope that you will embrace your husband with warmth and love and care as he navigates this first year. \n\nI am deeply sorry your family Easter plans changed, but perhaps a lovely long weekend apart from that holiday could soon be arranged. Peace to you.", "NAH - Grief is fickle. He might find it difficult right now to be around a family that, in his eyes, might look more \u201cwhole.\u201d He\u2019d be an AH if he tried to prevent you from going or guilted you, but it seems like he found himself unable to not be with his side of the family for this. It\u2019s their first Easter without his dad, and while I know the compromise was more than fair and accommodating, he might\u2019ve still felt obligated to spend the whole holiday with his side of the family.\n\nI think the first full year after someone\u2019s death is especially hard, because you\u2019re doing all of the \u201cfirst\u201d things without them. First birthday, first Easter, first Thanksgiving. A few months isn\u2019t long to mourn in the grand scheme of things.\n\nYou haven\u2019t been unreasonable or anything and your feelings are valid. You miss your husband and wish he would spend more time with the family. Would it be possible to arrange a visit with your family not during a holiday or special occasion first? That might be a good way to kind of \u201cbreak the ice\u201d in getting him back into the swing of spending time with people outside of his family.", "NAH. It\u2019s understandable that you need time over the holiday with each family. Your husband and his family probably need more close time this year due to his dad\u2019s passing, and I can understand your frustration that he won\u2019t spare a day for your side, but everyone grieves in their own way. Hopefully this is just a \u201cfirst year without dad\u201d issue and as time passes you guys can talk and decide on a more equitable balance for future visits. Enjoy your time with your family, maybe even more than the one day planned, and let him have his time as he needs. Plan for a talk a few weeks from now to make sure he understands you were disappointed and that you want more visits with your family. Consider couples counseling if this seems like a difficult conversation to manage calmly.", "I'm going to say NAH despite I think both of you doing not perfect things. Your husband should not have agreed to go to your families place if he wasn't going to, but him and his family are still in mourning over a sudden death that happened less than half a year ago. You can see why big family gatherings and holidays would be an especially hard time. On your end you have been supportive, tried to plan things out early, and have had things be lopsided in favor of his family.... but you are saying things that seem like you are more concerned with what your family thinks than what your husband feels. A response to your family of \" Husband and his family are still having a very hard time with his father's passing, he wishes he could be here and really appreciates how you guys set the rooms up for us, but needs to be with his family now\" is a fine response. No follow up needed. This won't be the norm forever, but it is going to be for at least the first year after a death.\n\nYou can be irritated, but I think if you make a big stink about this you'll cross into Y T A territory. He needs the grace right now, and at some point in the marriage the tables will flip and you'll need it too.", "EDIT after INFO: NTA\n\nYou're only 20 minutes away once you travel there.  This feels like a VERY easy problem to solve.  Spend half and half.  If your husband doesn't want to go to your parents, fine.  Go without him and take the baby.  It's only 20 minutes apart.  You can always drive back to one of the places, sleeping in the specific place isn't that important to me.  Sleep where beds and breakfast are best.\n\nINFO: how far apart are each set of parents?  Is this an hour drive?  4 hour flight?  Also, do you have kids?\n\nHere's why having kids changes the opinion: If you don't have kids, just spend your holidays apart.  Your parents don't really care if they see him (or his parents care to see you) that much.  If you have kids, unless there is a good reason, each grandparent should get a comparable amount of time.\n\nTravel distance matters because of convenience.  My MIL sees the family much more than my mom.  It's because my MIL is 10 minutes away and my mom is 3 hours.\n\nEither way, compromise shouldn't be that hard.  Sounds like your husband just doesn't like your family.", "NTA. You were supportive over Christmas, you\u2019ve accepted an imbalance over Easter but based on what you\u2019ve said, the imbalance has persisted for some time - it\u2019s not related to FIL passing away. That is something that needs discussing our and potentially makes him the AH.", "NTA. It's understandable that he wants to spend time with his mum as the loss is still very recent, but going from \"okay\" Yo \"we will see\" to \"No\" is very unfair on you. It allowed you to make plans, for others to change theirs, when he maybe knew all along that it wasn't going to happen.\n\nMy advice would be, to make peace with spending some time apart. Being a supportive spouse is exhausting and maybe, some time with your own family and putting your needs first, just for a little while, would be good for you. It's not something to feel awkward about; I think, despite the tension, you've done a great job at looking after him and you should be proud of yourself.", "NTA It was shitty of him to agree and then back out.", "You are NTA and your feeling are valid.  He is probably still grieving and can\u2019t get himself to leave so most likely he is NTA either. Losing someone I rough and different for different people. I lost my dog 3 months ago and I cry everyday sometime multiple times. He lost his dad, he could grieve for years.", "NTA, he is still grieving, and its his DAD the most important person in a mans life (ofc im assuming he was for your husband) he is not trying to take away your time from your family so he clearly did not intend to not go to your dads house for easter when you first asked, but as the time grew closer to easter he got cold feet and couldnt go through with it, I know that if my dad died suddenly it would be really hard for me to not spend time with his family and try to grasp air of his presence in some kind of weird normalcy for me and im assuming its the same for your husband. The best advice I could give you is try to be understanding, but still tell him that it bothered you that he changed plans all of a sudden (when telling him what bothered you do not do it in a accusatory way or in a way he feels like you are blaiming him and add more problems to what he is already going through)\n\n*EDIT added more to what i wanted to say \n*sorry if it has some spelling errors or that it doesnt make sense english is my 2nd lenguage", "ESH - gently. You two need to communicate effectively. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with him wanting to spend time with his family, especially after a sudden death but he needs to tell you this and not leave plans up in the air. \n\nIf you feel there\u2019s an imbalance in how often youre spending time with your side of the family vs his side, you need to compromise - that cant happen without communication.", "I know after losing my Dad the first year was the hardest. And he wants to be there for his Mom. But he is not alone in this marriage. And when he married you, he became part of your extended family also. Not just centered around his.   It doesn't sound like he is very interested in compromising if it isn't convenient for him.  Sounds like you need to plan things out very clearly and expect him to be more pro-active and supportive in abiding by splitting time fairly in the future.", "NTA\n\nHe and his family are greiving.  They need that space and time.  I don't think you should fault him for staying with his mom, through that time either.  It could have been a simple explanation to your family.", "nta and stop making plans with him for the near future in the mean time focus on you and your family and your kid i wouldnt even get him involved in the plans since he will change his mind again", "NTA, he should have communicated honestly with you and he should make a concerted effort to spend more time with your family at other points to compensate.", "soft yta - dude lost his dad and it's obviously affected him, yeah it'd be nicer if he set better expectations and didn't make problems he didn't keep, but if the roles were reversed, surely he'd be understanding of you wanting to mourn with your own family during certain events? Or not feeling up to being around a non-mourning family?", "YTA. Your husband is being there for his mom as she is still grieving the loss of her husband \n\nWhat if that was you? Would you want your husband to be annoyed?", "YTA for now. He just lost his dad. I would be extremely understanding with him staying with his family. Thats being said you should discuss the long term issue in a year or so but for now im sure he needs support.", "YTA I could understand if he'd stopped you from going as well but he didn't. You still got to see your family. You husband and his family are about to go through a year of \"firsts\" without their father. It's going to be hard all year long. Surely your family understands that. Plus seems crazy to think that each family is going to get the same amount of time. That's just not possible.", "YTA it's still fresh if you don't live it you don't know", "ESH.  Your husband should be slightly more accommodating or should have been more upfront with his actual wants instead of changing his mind. \n\nBut\u2026The first year losing someone is incredibly difficult. I understand where he is coming from.  Their entire world has crumbled. \n\nWhen it comes to losing someone you hold so dearly - it is very complicated..  Then first year is a web of complex emotions.  In the beginning, everyone is there and supportive - you feel the rally of your tribe and it helps, but at that point you are in shock and really aren\u2019t grasping the day to day reality of losing someone. You cling to the wreckage of life and your only goal is to survive.  Around month 3 that\u2019s when it really starts to hit and you start to come out of the shock.  It really hits, that person is GONE.  Then you are faced with cleaning out their closet, going through their things to donate or toss, and the wave of grief hits you again and again.  Every time you try, you end up crying uncontrollably or entering back into shock and avoidance.  But around this time, everyone has gone on with their life and they act like you should be over it too.  But you aren\u2019t, you can\u2019t\u2026at least not yet. Month 3-9 is when you need your tribe the most, it\u2019s when you are most vulnerable and exposed to the reality.  \n\nI highly suggest reading the below link on grief. It helped me a lot when I lost my mom. \n\n[https://thelossfoundation.org/grief-comes-in-waves/](https://thelossfoundation.org/grief-comes-in-waves/)\n\nThe triggers to losing my mom - the song Three Little Birds and a certain perfume.  Each time I run into one of those, the wound opens again and I feel that intense loss all over again to the point if I don\u2019t practice deep breathing exercises I start crying.  It\u2019s been 9 years for me.  Reality is you never stop grieving a loved one.", "NAH\n\nTough situation for all involved. Grief makes people a little crazy, it takes time to work his way out of. While that happens, it may be hard on you as well. Talk to each other.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You feel like maybe you're getting over it and suddenly, WHAM.\n\nMy birthday was a month and a half after my dad died, and when my mom called and said '**I** wanted to tell you Happy Birthday' instead of '**We** wanted to tell you Happy Birthday', I cried for hours.  Halloween sucked (he loved it).  Thanksgiving sucked.  Christmas sucked.  New Years?  Sucked super hard.  Rationality didn't get much of a peek in to thinks that first year.", "Updated based on info.  This feels pretty easy.  Split time.", "NAH.", "Sorry for your losses x\n\nI'm going to go with NTA.\n\nI am in a very similar dynamic to you right now as well. I (22) lost my father when I was 10, but my boyfriend (also 22) of 4 years 3 months lost his mother in July last year. I have repeatedly encouraged me to communicate with me if there is anything he would find difficult (and he does communicate). I also communicate with my bf if there is something I don't want to do because of my father.\n\nI can understand that your bf is grieving and will find events like this hard, but if he was unsure, then he should've communicated that to you from the start. Even if he wasn't sure about his feelings at the time, that uncertainty should've been communicated. This is why instead of N A H, I vote NTA. In agreeing to go then backing out at the last minute, he snubbed your family, which isn't great if other family members have arranged accommodation etc. What doesn't help is that your family already resent the fact that you both visit his family more.\n\nGiven that the death was only in December, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt that the grief was a bit too overwhelming this Easter, and that's why he wanted to visit his mother. It's understandable.\n\nIF he continues to avoid your family events in the future, then I personally would find that a problem. Because it's essentially sending a message that he is resenting you for having a father alive. You wouldn't avoid his mother because you've lost yours. Yes, one could argue that you may have had more time to process your bereavement, but your loss is just as devastating and permanent as his.\n\nAs someone pointed out in the comments, there is a way round where you can both see your parents separately but I think you need to sit him down and tell him that he needs to communicate with you properly rather than making commitments he doesn't want to make.\n\nI hope I've helped. Grief does affect people differently, and people may have different perspectives, so if you want to approach this another way, then that's okay xxx", "NTA", "NTA I think that yo have been supportive and that it was definitely unfair for him to cancel last minute even after agreeing to coming.", "NTA. The end of your post gives away a lot to me. Now I don\u2019t think this is a make or break issue. But my ex was always the type where we spent far more time with his family than mine during holidays. It was rough. The sudden death in the family is amplifying this issue. Which is not the fault of your husband or his family, they absolutely should grieve how they feel they need especially this so soon after. But the \u201cok\u201d \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d \u201cno\u201d issue paired with the the previous inbalance in family time is just something that needs to be sorted out for future visits.
