How on earth can she expect to be paid after ignoring your direct requests.", "NTA - She trashed the house, stole, and got drunk on the job. Unacceptable behavior and she does not deserve to get paid after choosing to act so irresponsibly. I\u2019m sure that bag cost more than whatever you were going to pay her anyway, and if she can\u2019t get it back to you then she\u2019ll at least need to pay you back the dollar amount.", "NTA. You are essentially using what you were going to pay her to pay for the damages she and her friends caused.
