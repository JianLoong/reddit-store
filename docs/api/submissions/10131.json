I held up many a lines with my rearranging. I\u2019m going with NAH because I understand it\u2019s extremely frustrating for you, but I don\u2019t think your husband is doing this to be a pain or because he thinks it\u2019s \u201cright\u201d, it sounds like he can\u2019t help himself. He should see a doctor about this.", "Gentle YTA because it sounds like you're open here: I think this is a mental health issue. It's not about the cupboards.", "This is textbook OCD. Some have suggested it could be autism, and while that can\u2019t be ruled out here, this feels much more like OCD. Folks with OCD frequently have illogical rules they need to follow. If one thing is off they need to redo a thing. To the outside observer, it will appear absurd. But in their brain, they have to do it this way. Technically YTA. But I think it came from a place of poor information. You didn\u2019t know this was a mental health issue. As you said, it felt like he was messing with you. He needs to see a psychiatrist for medication and a psychologist who does cognitive-behavioral therapy with experience in exposure & response prevention therapy for OCD.", "What if it's his kitchen and OP is putting things in stupid places because she doesn't understand his system?", "And I see your point, but but wouldn\u2019t he notice that he was the only one doing these things? (Obviously not the only one in the world, but you n on law what I mean.) OP didn\u2019t handle it well at all. But you can\u2019t take away OP\u2019s husband\u2019s responsibility and therefor anatomy in this.", ">Autism and these types of ways brains work are not disabilities but rather different abilities.\n\nI think you're trying to be nice, but as the parent of an autistic child, please take it from me: Autism *is* a disability.", "You do when you want to hurt them, apparently.", "Thanks for doing the dirty work.", "No he\u2019s not. He\u2019s putting all utensils in one drawer, probably separated, like normal people. And he doesn\u2019t want Tupperware with his dishes and he wants dishes to be with their sets and separate from glasses. Quite reasonable. Exactly how every kitchen I\u2019ve ever been in is set up. Only weird thing is throwing away a set of utensils when one goes missing, but it\u2019s pretty odd that silverware would go missing anyway, where are they taking it?", "It's remarkably simple to rationalize it as, \"I'm the particular one, so it's my problem. I'll just take care of it myself.\" Again, if nobody is challenging the behavior, he'd have no reason to see an issue with it.", "This just broke my brain. I'm so sorry! I don't get what makes these people think that reorganizing someone else's space without direct permission is a good idea at all. (The envelope thing, I just... wtf?) I went away for a week and left my mom in charge of my pets at my apartment. I left written instructions for the dog food/supplements that she managed to screw up, and came home to my kitchen totally \"reorganized\" and kitchen/bath accessorized with stuff I don't even like, despite having clearly stated that she wasn't to touch ANYTHING, except maybe if she wanted to wash the dishes that I left. Her response when I got mad upon my return? \"I know you said not to, but I wanted to (tee hee)\". I suspect she wasn't trying to teach me to never trust her again, but that's what she managed. The worst part is that I came back refreshed and ready to clean and organize, and after seeing what she did I lost that (no idea why) and it took me forever to be able to deal with the areas she messed with.", "Did you tell her how mad it made you? And she still did it again? Kick her out!!", "Then let the person who cares put the dishes away. Stop emptying the dishwasher or the dish drainer and just leave that part to him. If you KNOW with absolute certainty that it has to be his way (and OP does know) just stop being part of the problem and let the dude do his organizing.", "As someone with autism\u2026 it is a disability", "She said elsewhere he demands each set in a different drawer.", "But it doesn\u2019t affect her in any way - she doesn\u2019t have to \u201csuffer\u201d. \n\nHe rearranges them BY HIMSELF - with no reliance on her. \n\nShould he get help for his possible OCD - absolutely yes. But is he being insufferable, no. Like I said, he doesn\u2019t ask her to do anything, he does it himself.", "> He could also be autistic, but since none of us are medical professionals it's not our place to diagnose. \n\nI don't need a medical degree to call 911 for someone when their arm is disconnect from their body.\n\nI don't need a medical degree to point out that spending hours 5 times a week to organize a kitchen is a major indicator of either mental illness or neurodivergence.", "Twice a year =/= 5 times in one week", "I think that we need our own space in the house. My wife does most of the cooking, so we have agreed that she gets to decide how the kitchen is arranged. It drives me nuts sometimes, but I just ask her where things are when I need them.", "I have OCD, the \u201cthings getting into my body\u201d type and it\u2019s really horrific. It\u2019s just horrible horrible intrusive thoughts about gross things constantly ruining my day and needing to do my little ritual or those intrusive thoughts would come true. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely a mental illness.", "autism is a different neurotype, ocd is literally a mental illness. I have ocd, and a lot of my close friends are autistic and we nerd out on the way our brains work, and it's just a different category of thing. OCD can sometimes be helpful, but most of the time it's just giving me horrible hyperrealistic intrusive thoughts of bad things happening to people I love, or making me get off the bus and spend $30 on a lyft back home because \"what if I forgot to lock the door\" (I didn't, it was locked). It's not the same.\n\nOCD makes you feel like your rituals are fundamentally necessary and also just common sense, it will sneak in and convince you horrid things will happen if they're not done right... it can cause real distress if they're interrupted, and if you aren't diagnosed and don't know what to look for, it can feel like the people around you should have known, it was obvious, they did it on purpose... it really would explain OP's husband's behavior (though I'm not a therapist and I've never met him and it could be other things, he should see a doctor)", "> One day he reorganized my sewing room\n\nHoly shit! The dude was asking for trouble! My wife is welcome in my sewing room, but she is not welcome to change it without my concurrence.\n\nNot that she would, since I am the person who mends clothing.\n\nPS: I know this is non-traditional, but my Grandmother taught me to sew and I like the ability to fix things.", "To me it sounds a little more likely she's throwing things wherever for the 5th time this week \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, mans clearly has some pretty rigid rules per OP's comment, but they do sound consistent.", "I feel like OP is fucking with him by purposely putting things in the wrong location though", "Actually, she DOES imply it\u2026she states that he goes behind her when she\u2019s putting away the dishes, and that she cannot cook dinner at dinnertime because he\u2019s still deep in redoing the whole kitchen then.", "Exactly. I snip at my husband when he puts crap in the wrong spot because then it takes me longer to figure out where he put it.  If it has a place, it stays in that place so I know where in general to find it every time. It's infuriating to be looking for the veggie peeler and it's been put into a different place each time he unloads. But, if OPs husband is constantly rearranging, I'd have gone crazy by now.", "Yeah, I've heard there are people who specifically trigger their partner's OCD as some sort of punishment. I wish them all eternally wet socks, whoever and wherever they may be.", "Or has such disdain that she does not bother to try.  At this point, whoever is changing it every day is that AH.", "This whole post set off abuse red flags for me. Destroying things and calling him pathetic? Also it doesn\u2019t take long to learn where things go in a kitchen (as a nanny that\u2019s had to unload the dishwasher at most jobs). So it does seem like she\u2019s doing this on purpose and gaslighting him about it", "Happy cake day.", "Yep. It still hurts. At least I know I can get past any adversity now.", "She said she wants to cook dinner and its 7:00 and she can't cook because he has the kitchen torn apart. I gathered from that, she was the main cook in the family."]}
