The wife thought the husband was just lazy/difficult and had enough. When their kids were teenagers, two of them were diagnosed with severe ADHD and it became clear that he had a similar level of undiagnosed ADHD and just didn't have the coping strategies to manage it.", "Did you even read the post? He had a meltdown from having the kitchen disorganized. He spends several hours reorganizing the kitchen. All of his actions center around high organization and no deviation from it. He cried and LEFT THE HOUSE because the dishes weren't where he wanted them.", "Wow. This is very clearly a mental health issue. I bet that he doesn\u2019t actually want to be doing this either, but he feels like he has no choice.", "And when you choose to put everything away in the wrong place, every time, despite knowing his preferences, are you doing it with the intention of pissing him off?\n\nIt clearly doesn't save any time for anyone for you to put it away in the wrong place. You said he always has to redo it, so you've doubled the workload.", "I don\u2019t know anyone who stores dishes one eats from (bowls, mugs) in the same cabinet as food storage containers (Tupperware, jars). \n\nIf you stack bowls with their mates, it will be easy to find the correct number for the number of dinners. \n\nYou can buy single replacements for silverware and cutlery so it doesn\u2019t make sense to throw a set away because one is missing. Storing them as a set is logical because that way you know how many you have and are clean. \n\nInstead of punishing him for being organized, why can\u2019t you tell him what time you need the kitchen to be ready for you to cook?\n\nWhat does it matter to you if he spends an hour organizing? It sounds like a win/win. You both get an organized kitchen; he can put things where he wants them and you don\u2019t have to put things away.", "Do you think if he were allowed to get it organized the way he wants and were the sole person responsible for putting away the dishes it might take him less time? If you're putting things just anywhere, of course it's going to take him time to \"fix\" it. But like others have said, he needs to get checked out for OCD or some other condition.", "Yeah there's something else wrong here; my husband can be a controlling sonofabitch with obsessive tendencies, and even *he* has backed down when I told him that since I was a SAHM and did all the kitchen work, he could fuck right off.\n\nYour fella needs to see a doctor, like, yesterday.", "This is what I was looking for.  I would talk to him about getting tested for some kind of neurodivergence.", "How is rearranging the dishes in a certain order being insufferable to live it? How is that bothering you? It's a benefit if anything, you will always know where something is. Op sounds insufferable if anything, imagine calling your SO pathetic for having a breakdown. I doubt he will be vulnerable with her again.", "Him spending several hours reorganising a cabinet should have been clue number one", "OP has a comment that says they know how the husband puts things and he still has to reorganize. Something tells me OP may be putting away stuff wrong on purpose but its just a hunch.", "His view might be that he organizes the kitchen only to have the original poster throw everything in the cupboards willy nilly so that nothing can be found. He may be frustrated at having to constantly reorganize because the original poster won\u2019t put things where they go. \n\nI would also cry if my husband purposely destroyed my organization of the kitchen cupboards. The original poster was mean. \n\nIt\u2019s telling that the original poster doesn\u2019t say who does the cooking. In my house, I do so I get final say over how things are organized.", "Why can't OP also decide how the kitchen in her home is organized? Why does she get no input on where things work better for her? Why does she have to bow to his kitchen organization whims?", "He does it for hours. I don't agree with OP's attitude, but how is it not insufferable?", "He could also be autistic, but since none of us are medical professionals it's not our place to diagnose. I like things to be a certain way but I feel the way the husband is behaving is going to far, even if he does have autism or ocd that doesn't excuse leaving the kitchen torn apart MULTIPLE times in a week, mental health issues are reasons people behave a specific way never an excuse. \n\nBoth parties need to go to a therapist to work this out and potentially see if there is an underlying mental health issue causing his behavior", "I don\u2019t have OCD, yet twice a year I empty my kitchen shelves, clean the shelves, throw out any expired food and organize everything. This takes hours. \n \nI only need to do it twice a year because I don\u2019t have anyone purposely wrecking my system of organization.", "[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354432#:\\~:text=Obsessive%2Dcompulsive%20disorder%20(OCD)%20features%20a%20pattern%20of%20unwanted,activities%20and%20cause%20significant%20distress](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354432#:~:text=Obsessive%2Dcompulsive%20disorder%20(OCD)%20features%20a%20pattern%20of%20unwanted,activities%20and%20cause%20significant%20distress).\n\n>*Obsessions often have themes to them, such as:*\r  \n\r  \nFear of contamination or dirt\r  \nDoubting and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty\r  \n**Needing things orderly and symmetrical**\r  \nAggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others\r  \nUnwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects  \n>  \n>*Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include:*\r  \n\r  \nFear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched\r  \nDoubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove\r  \n**Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way**\r  \nImages of driving your car into a crowd of people\r  \nThoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public\r  \nUnpleasant sexual images\r  \nAvoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands", "Because she has expressed she doesn't care about the actual orientation just that he is obsessive about it.
