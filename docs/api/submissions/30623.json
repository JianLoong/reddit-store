Most women have zero issues with transgender individuals; in fact, women have historically been bigger supporters than men in the LGBTQ community. So, why are they degrading us? It's not enough that we have to defend ourselves against the patriarchal system, but now against the transgender community too! Just let us be! We are women!

I as well do not see the need to \"detach\" myself verbally from transwomen.\n\nIf you feel the absolute need to distinguish in a conversation because it is about the topic of trans : Ok.

I don\u2019t think they\u2019re an asshole for trying to maintain a relationship with you by giving you the benefit of the doubt but also gently checking you on something.\n\nHonestly, this seems like pretty good friend communication and I think you should remember that this person is trying to keep your friendship healthy by communicating with you.", "You brought up and complained about women\u2019s issues.

Unfortunately medical sexism is so deeply ingrained, and mostly subconscious, that it would be incredibly naive to think it doesn't also affect trans women.)\n\nAnd equally, there are situations where trans people face discrimination which is different to (and often in addition to!) the types of discrimination suffered by cis women.\n\nI think this is a NAH situation, because you were overthinking things and made an insensitive choice of words, and she ignored the very narrow,  specific incident that you were talking about period pain and reacted about the wider experience.", "NTA.

By the time I was allowed, I needed blood transfusions every few weeks. I was bleeding 28/28 days, passing clots the size of my own fist and in excruciating pain where the endo had spread outside my uterus and was all over my abdominal walls, so when they yeeted the uterus they also followed with a laser ablation of all the patches of endo they could find. \n\nIt\u2019s very sweet of you to want to be so inclusive!
