It\u2019s so lovely that you\u2019ve been able to support your sister when you knew that your parents wouldn\u2019t. They are cruel people.\n\nNTA. Go to college, live your life and call Social Services as much as you can to protect her from their negligence. One day, you can have an adult relationship with your sister as the only other person who experienced something similar to what you did.", "NTA\n\nYou don't remember your old babysitter because that person stopped being part of your life when you were still young. That isn't going to happen with you and your sister.\n\nProviding only housing is NOT enough to raise a child, it's not even touching on the bare minimum of what a child needs. Your parents are absent and they get away with it because you have been forced into the role of a parent. That is NOT OK.\n\nYou stood up for yourself and for what is best for your sister, which is your parents actually parenting. Your parents do not care and plan to continue to force you to parent your sister.\n\nYou need to call child protective services or whatever the equivalent is in your country. Call them to explain all your concerns for your sister but also for yourself as you are also a minor. Document everything that happens in the house where you feel this isn't right, like them abandoning the child with you, them refusing to take care of their own child, and anything else that goes on that affects your sister but also yourself.\n\nDo not get trapped by your sister. Your parents only see you as a babysitter/parent to their kid that they refuse to parent. If you do not stand up for yourself, you will end up being made responsible for your sister until she's 18, and it would ruin your chances of getting a job or higher education.\n\nTalk to a trusted teacher in school if there are no child services that you can call/you don't know who to call.\n\nGood luck with all of it!", "Your parents are manipulative and lazy. \n\nTake care of yourself first, and if you're able to and WANT to help out your sister.", "NTA.  OP you are being parentified which is a form of emotional abuse", "NTA this is neglect on the part of your parents and they're parentifying you which is a form of abuse.", "NTA.  This is a form of abuse called parentification.  Stay firm in your resolve to make your parents actually parent the child they chose to have.  If they leave her with you call CPS.", "This is a tough situation. Of course you shouldn't be expected to take care of your little sister as though she were your child, but I can't help feeling very sorry for your sister. None of this is her fault.", "My heart goes out to you both. NTA. Continue correcting your sister and transition to being a bigger brother rather than a father like you already are. Your parents will not change, and it doesn\u2019t  seem like they want to change.", "We have a school counselor. I will see if I can talk to her.", "In their mind that has never been their job. But I don't even know if they consider themselves parents. They have never really taken on that role for either of us. Sometimes I wonder why mom continued with her pregnancies because they sure don't seem to like or want us.", "Yeah this seems like a textbook case, I mean the kid is literally calling OP dad and the parents are like, yup that's ok!", "Sorry, a word is missing there. They said it would be cruel to drop her like that and stop being her dad basically.", "This is great advice. OP if you can prove you can financially support yourself you can emancipate and get out before 18, whether you choose to take your sister with you or not. Then do online college while working", "YES That is the way forward! She will know whom else to contact like social services etc.", "Before you go to your counselor, look up parentification, so you can talk to them with a little bit of information that you can correlate with your experiences \n\nIf you go in there and say my parents make me babysit my sibling all the time and she calls me dad, they'll just smile and tell you that it's adorable.", "Having a 15 year old do all of the caretaking for a 4 year old is a massive red flag for child neglect. Your school counselor will absolutely help you.", "Because that\u2019s what society told her she should be doing and what she actually should have been doing was having her tubes tied. There are people who just shouldn\u2019t be having kids.\n\n\nI hate to be one of those Reddit people that tells you to start making plans on how to secure your future and get away from your parents, getting a therapist, and  once you move out and going completely no contact but I do sincerely believe that you need to start considering all of those options. \n\nThese people are not your parents they\u2019re not your mom and dad they are people who make sure you survive to a standard that won\u2019t get them arrested or thrown in jail. I\u2019m betting once you hit 18 they\u2019ll try to kick you out anyways and won\u2019t care to ever contact you until potentially in the future you have kids and people wonder why they never see their kids or grandkids and it puts them in a awkward position (if people are aware they even have kids), but that will then be the problem not a problem. \n\nI wish you all the best the universe has to offer you and hopefully a very easy loving future with a found family\n\nYou are NTA and your parents sadly are weird little monsters who should be punished appropriately.", "ESH.\nYour parents for obvious reasons. \n\nYou for thinking you can just cut her out like that. She\u2019s obviously grown a huge emotional attachment to you and with what you\u2019ve said of your past, would you want to put her through the same thing? She\u2019s probably going to need you a lot as an emotional rock and as her brother you should be there for her. And at 4 she definitely would understand bro vs dad if you reinforce it enough.", "You need to call cps or talk to someone that is a mandatory reporter", "NTA.  As someone who grew up in a similar family situation, I just wanted to tell you to hang in there yourself, this stuff is rough when you are trying to figure your own life out.  You shouldn't have to parent a young sibling, this is your parents responsibility.  \n\nIn my family, it ended up ruining our sibling relationship as adults - my younger siblings were largely protected from the neglect because my older sister and I did everything.  Now, as adults, they accuse me and my older sister of lying when we talk about our rough childhood, and why we don't talk to our parents anymore, because we protected them from the neglect so they really didn't experience it.    Had CPS gotten involved early, it might not have prevented my parents neglect of me, but it might have salvaged my adult relationship with my younger siblings.\n\nAt 15, you deserve to have as normal a life as possible and as you desire.  Don't be scared to get outside help with this.  Your school will probably have some resources.", "I have the privilege of working on site (I'm an engineer) and I was pleasantly surprised and slightly jealous of how well the trades pay! I wish I would have been told that back when I was younger and heading into school - apprenticeships are usually shorter than university, paid, and pretty much have guaranteed job security. \n\nOur ironworkers are making 115,000 ($28 hr for apprentices) and our plumbers are a generally a bit lower but maxing in at 125k. The port crane operators make an honest living... but tower crane operators get paid more than my partner, who is a doctor! \n\nThe number one thing I urge kids to do is go into the trades!", "They should take permanent steps to not have any more children. They are horrible people."]}
