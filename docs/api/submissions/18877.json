DH mentioned splitting the cost to replace the privacy fence (we have a chain link fence), but the man said he didn't even want a fence because he had a no-pets rule.\n\nNine months ago, a new family moved in. They have kids the same age as ours (5 - 10) and a dog.\n\nThey leave their dog outside all day and never check on him when he barks, which is constant.\n\nWe also have a large dog. One day, we let our dog outside and their dog appeared in our yard. It was a tense while we tried to get our dog back inside. Their dog was aggressive and barking at us and the neighbors didn't even stick their head outside to see what was going on. Fortunately, it ended up being very friendly with our dog and eventually warmed up to our family.\n\nWe've tried to keep their dog in their yard, but nothing has worked. We've also heard from other neighbors that it has been getting into their yards to play with their dogs and it has been loose in the neighborhood on multiple occasions.  \n\nI feel for the poor boy, because it is clear that he is bored and just wants some attention. Since he is outside all day and nobody ever checks up on him, I leave an extra water bowl by the fence line.\n\nAnyways.... Last week, we called a local company about a yard project. A younger man showed up and we took him to the backyard. \n\nOn cue, the neighbor dog comes under the fence. The dog was barking at him, but I calmed him down. I apologized for the dog and told the guy that it was the neighbors dog, he comes over every day, and we haven't found a way to successfully keep him out of the yard. Our fence is lined with landscaping rocks and stakes. The man was very interested, then revealed that he was the landlord of the rental. He bought it about a year ago from the older man and has a strict no-pets policy. \n\nYesterday, our kids were outside with our dog and the neighbor dog. I heard shouting and ran outside. The neighbor kids were outside screaming at my kids that they had to move and go to a new school, because we told the landlord about their dog. It was a mess! The dogs were barking, the neighbor kids were screaming, my kids were crying. \n\nAs I was trying to get to the bottom of everything, the neighbor dad stomped out. We both told our kids to go inside, but as I heading back inside with our kids and dog, he said none of this would have happened if I just minded my own business. I turned around and said, \"Your dog has been getting into everyone's yards for MONTHS and you haven't done anything about it.\" \n\nHe said if people had a problem with it, we should have talked to him first. And since I left a water bowl out, I was inticing his dog over to our yard. He said it is not right that his kids have to move to a new school, just because their 'friendly' dog wanted to play.
