She\u2019s home from college. Do you take her out to dinner, go to a movie, spend 1:1 time with her? Do you know the names of her roommate/s, friend/s and boyfriend? What classes is she taking? What time do you spend with just her?", "This is one of those times where it doesn\u2019t matter if your TA or not. \n\n\nYou and your oldest daughter most likely need to go to family therapy together. Seeing you parent and interact with your youngest daughter is hurting her badly enough that you asking her not to react poorly in front of her little sister is pointless. She doesn\u2019t seem to be getting over it herself, she probably needs professional help. You both do.", "Im really sorry to point this out but even when you are apologising to eldest you are still making it about 4y . This is just building more resentment. Keep the dialogue with oldest strictly on you and accountability for the past actions.  When she compares bring it back to you realising your crappy history and while you cant change past, you want to build a healthy relationship with oldest from this point forward.  \nYou cant turn back time but you can change the future. Im in similar situation. It does get easier but you have to atone. I was Shitty parent but brilliant grandmother.  We are great 90% of the time now. Occasionally she will be triggered seeing me do something with grandies and make offhand comment. I ALWAYS  acknowledge i know that i was shitty and that will plague me everyday until i kick the bucket. Our inside joke is that i can chase the 'good parent bus' all day and will never catch it BUT im the driver of the 'good granny bus'. Edited to add kudos for realising you're past mistakes", "YTA. Your whole vibe here is very \"yeah I was a crap parent but oh well too late now [shrug emoji]\" and then you're upset that she's not willing to shrug emoji back at you and move on like you want to do.\n\nHave you taken real accountability? Beyond just saying yeah I should've done better for you? Had a real conversation about it, not about why you did what you did, but about the effect it had on her? Without focusing on minimizing and deflecting?\n\nShe lost her only real parent at a very young age, and got dumped on her deadbeat dad who she knew damn well hadn't wanted her. She spent the rest of her childhood growing up as the unwanted child of the family, knowing she was only there out of obligation. Stop for a second and imagine what that will do to someone. The kind of deep, deep scars that will leave.\n\nShe is in tremendous pain right now, and you only care about it to the extent that it affects the daughter you actually wanted to have. Do you not see why she's upset with you? Have some empathy, ye gods.\n\nTherapy - both together and individually - is the only way you have even a prayer of fixing this, if that's really your goal.", "YTA you know how you help that tension? Actually give a shit about your oldest too.", "YTA - I want you to stop and do a little math. Your daughter was almost the same age you were when she was born, and you did not want to have a baby in your life at that age. Well, newsflash: neither does she. \n\nExpecting your oldest daughter to bond with a sister 16 years younger is a huge expectation. Your youngest was born when your oldest was learning to drive. Your youngest was potty training when your oldest was graduating high school. Your oldest is now almost old enough to legally drink, and your youngest probably still can't even tie her own shoes. \n\nWhile I am glad you own your bad parenting, that doesn't change that every time your daughter sees you being a father to a young girl she has resentment. The thing is, I don't think you are as self-actualized as you think. You say your shitty actions come from being young and immature, but don't respect that her actions come place. I also question if you truly feel that your older daughter is taking her anger out on your younger daughter, or if you are really embarrassed that your older daughter is covering your ass so that your younger daughter only sees you as a hero father and not the flawed human being that we all are.", "YTA. We get it, your youngest is your do over kid and your priority. \n\nYour oldest daughter wants to feel like a priority too.", "You claim to own up to your mistakes, but what kind of father you've been to your daughter for the 5 years she's been with you? Have you tried to mend things during this time? Or did you only start to be a father to your do over kid?", "Wow okay. NTA for giving the younger daughter a good experience and NTA for wanting to keep her out of it and foster good relationships\n\nYTA however because you haven't tried to look at this from your oldests daughter's point of view. You weren't there, you weren't interested. The only reason she's with you is because her mother died and you got 'stuck' with her. Now she's in a home watching someone else get everything you never wanted to do, and never would have if her mum was still alive. I totally understand her resentment towards your youngest, even if it is misplaced. I think you're saying all the right things but I don't think your oldest feels it at all. You've got a lot of bridges to mend, and I don't think reprimanding her because of her attitude will help.", "YTA. Your oldest daughter is devastated because of how much you love and care for your youngest. She never had that from you and she gets it shoved in her face every time she sees you. You are your oldest daughter\u2019s only parent and you still can\u2019t give her the love and attention she has always wanted from you. Until you attempt to repair your relationship with your oldest, she won\u2019t want anything to do with your precious youngest. All that time and energy you are putting into being a good parent to your youngest, you should be tripling that with your eldest. Your daughter is broken - she had a mom who died and is left with a dad who only has eyes for his youngest. You contributed to breaking this kid, now work your ass off to help her heal.", "Therapy. For her. For you. For her and you.", "Hey I was a bad dad but you don\u2019t get to show your feeling cause I\u2019m showing how good of a dad I am now and rubbing it in your face \n\nYTA\n\nShe clearly was upset but you choice to tell her not time and place was rude your the problem you caused her to feel less then she is.   You should of worked on your relationship with your oldest", "OP go to therapy not Reddit. Everyone here wants you to neglect your youngest in favor of your oldest. Or they just assume that you\u2019ve been ignoring your older daughter since she\u2019s moved in with you. Ask your older daughter if she\u2019s willing to working through your issues together in therapy and start there", "YTA because I think you are invalidating her feelings and showing favoritism towards your youngest. It\u2019s sounds like you want to sweep her feelings under the rug so you don\u2019t have to face the truth. She is probably still grieving the loss of her mother and home and having to adjust to all these new family members. This family needs therapy.", "Coming from a girl with an absent father, this is what I think would help me feel better: \n\n- A genuine apology taking full accountability, and conveying your emotion about the entire situation. She needs to hear in your voice that you regret your actions. The apology cannot feel forced \u2014 it has to feel full of love. Do not mention your youngest in this apology. It should be just about you and your oldest. \n\n- Better your relationship NOW. You can\u2019t change the past but you can get to know her now. Spoil her. Treat her like an (age appropriate) princess. It\u2019s okay that she\u2019s older now because you\u2019re making up for lost time. Make a point to spend quality time with her and be the dad now that she wished she had earlier. \n\n- She\u2019s insecure about your love for her so you need to remind her of it often. Send her random texts to let her know you think of her while she\u2019s at school. Ask her how she\u2019s doing. Give her frequent hugs when she\u2019s at home. Buy her little gifts when you can. Be consistent. That way, she can start to trust that you and your love for her aren\u2019t going anywhere. You\u2019re here to stay. \n\n- Enroll in family therapy so you and her have a safe place to hash out your emotions. There are some things that might need to be said or worked through and a good professional can help. \n\nTry to remember your oldest is a girl who was abandoned by her father by choice, and her mother through death. She feels utterly alone and she can\u2019t accept her sister\u2019s love right now because what she needs is a parent\u2019s love. Go all out for her. She deserves it. \n\nYTA right now but you don\u2019t have to be forever.

However, you own up to that, and your comments show that you do try to make up for it to your oldest as best as you can. The constant outrage and picking on her little sister from your daughter is unacceptable- you're not wrong to tell her point blank that none of this is a four year old's fault and that she can't have these conversations in said four year old's hearing without doing damage.\n\nHowever, I would like to know what you're doing to give her space to have these conversations? Perhaps some family therapy for just the two of you is in order to start working through some of this resentment your daughter harbors. It sounds like you're supporting her physical needs but maybe you're not as in touch emotionally as she'd like you to be, so she's lashing out at her sister who she sees as having a stronger bond with you. If that isn't an option, maybe just more one-on-one time where you ask her openly what she'd like you to do to start being the father she needs- clearly she feels as if you're still lacking if the pain from all those years ago is that raw, and maybe it's as simple as a little extra communication from you or some additional validation that she's special to you the way your littlest one is. \n\nI don't think you're TA but I do think you need to work on your relationship.", "Are you prioritizing time with your older daughter now\u2026 do you just spend one on one time getting to know her.. have you gone to therapy with her.., \n\nSomething tells me no\u2026 you are focused on the new daughter.. \n\nI would be highly upset as well.. and yes I would be jealous of the 4 yr old as well.\n \nIf mom hadn\u2019t passed away older daughter would probably never see you.\n\nYTA.. prioritize your older daughter for once..", "Are you active in your oldest daughter's life now?

A lot of comments here are ignoring how this is affecting the little girl. It\u2019s not about protecting your feelings, but hers. If older sister doesn\u2019t want to have a relationship with her sister then she shouldn\u2019t have to, but then there needs to be firm boundaries. Separate your time with them as much as you are able. When the oldest is around the youngest she has to be cordial. She cannot be starting fights in front of the four-year-old. If she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with her sister then respect that and structure your life accordingly.", "YTA. You were invalidating her feelings.

She's less likely to start the convo in front of sis if you start it at a better time. Have you asked what you can do to be here for her now, and have you continuously followed through with doing it? She won't need to be as jealous of sis getting your care and attention if she's also getting some. Of course, she may say it's too late and she doesn't want/need anything now, but you have to make it clear the offer is open and always will be, and respect her wishes when she does express them.\n\nI really recommend going to family therapy if you can.", ">I am giving my second daughter the father my first didn't have.\n\n...Are you serious right now? You had the chance to start fresh with your daughter when she was 15, and instead of doing that...you apparently poured ALL your dad energy into the shiny new daughter who is a clean slate and requires little work on your part. Make no mistake: this was *never* an \"either/or\" situation, love is not a finite resource unless you personally choose to make it so, and you could have devoted as much care and love to your older daughter as you did to your youngest. But that would've taken work and you don't seem to be interested in that.\n\nYTA. Hugely. The resentment your oldest feels toward her sister is squarely YOUR fault.

All you said was \"not now.\" I'm sure she's used to hearing that from you though.", "There's a lot of emotion involved and your daughter probably needs some therapy to help unpack it.\n\n  \nNo the 4 year old doesn't deserve any of this and she's the innocent party but there is a lot of unresolved trauma for your daughter and it's a really hard thing to put past when you missed out on so much that you are seeing your sister get.  Also don't forget that her mother died so it's not like she even has her.  In her eyes the 4 year old has two attentive parents and a charmed life v's what she needed to deal with at the same age.  That's not her fault either.\n\nYou actually need a third party to navigate this.  Your eldest sounds like she's really struggling with this.\n\nYour words weren't wrong - you acknowledged your behaviour was wrong and you can't change the past.  I can see why she would feel in validated but time has passed and you are not the same person you were 20 years ago and your circumstances are not the same either.\n\nYou probably need to focus on building your relationship with your eldest as just the two of you and stop expecting her to have a relationship with the 4 year old at this point.  That will hopefully come in time.\n\nJust the two of you together to get to know each other... and some family therapy (just the two of you again - don't involve the others, your son would be the next one to involve but leave your wife and 4 year old out of this initial stage of rebuilding your relationship).  So it will be doing stuff together and talking.  \n\nShe has no obligation to have a relationship with anyone and she can't have one with her youngest sibling then this is something that you will have to accept.   She can't be mean and nasty to her though.  Family get togethers may be a bit awkward if the 4 year old expects it so you're going to have an age appropriate talk with her.

I actually think that my little brother helped my dad grow as a person and be a better man. We were able to really work through the resentment. He's more present and active in all of our lives.

If the only times she sees him are also always with the kid in tow I can completely understand it bubbling up and over at this point. The woman needs therapy and honestly it'd probably be best for her to go low or no contact for at least a bit. If they're gonna keep a relationship though it has to be seriously and genuinely talked about, not just in a \"I know I was shitty, I can't change that, stop talking about it in front of your sister.\" \n\nNot to mention it sounds like the only way she's actually taking anything out on the 4 year old is simply by not really interacting/ being as close to her as op would like. The comments she's making aren't being mean to the 4 year old, she's saying the kids lucky, if anything they're just digs at op. Which while isn't exactly appropriate, once again if they don't have time away from the kid to hash out, is bound to happen. Personally I can't judge someone to much for being a bit harsh towards a shitty parent, especially if there's never been a genuine attempt on the parents side to listen, take ownership, and try to mend the relationship between parent and child. It gets worse when you remember that the only reason he started being a more permanent fixture in her life was because her mother died, not because of a want to rebuild the relationship.", "Knowing that her father wasn't a good one to her sister is not gonna 'damage' her.", "He didn't want anything to be different before that.

As opposed to many posts here, this one doesn't try to hide the poop, and that makes mee find OP believable.\nOP tries to foster a good relationship between his daughter and her half-sister, but I don't know if that's possible (right now). NTA for trying to get daughter to aim her anger and frustration at OP as opposed to the toddler.\nDaughter is NTA for not feeling heard; in her situation I can totally understand.\nSo right now NAH; in the past the asshole is obvious, but the asshole knows.\n\nThe daughter has been dealt an extremely shitty hand at life: an absentee father, and a mother she lost way to early. She's absolutely right to think life was unfair to her. Her anger and frustration hurts the people around her, but probably herself as well. To lose that, sadly, I don't think there's anything dad can do. He can and should try always, but the can't take away the years he wasn't there. That means the work to let this go is on herself, which again is very unfair. Dad can and should help in this by providing therapy (when she asks) and joining in if necessary. I could also imagine times there'd be less or no contact to avoid the pain, and dad should accept that as well.\n\nVery relatable: my wife's father was a US soldier stationed in Europe. Lack of proper communication between him and my MIL ensured they never got back together and he remarried in the US.

If they don't then it seems less deliberate and vengeful and simply more the product of what happens when you're a shitty parent to a child that grows onto an adult while watching you be what they wanted their whole life. That's why I said she should stop contact with op. If he's not going to give her the time of day to actually try to fix things and be a present parent now, this is an obvious result. The resentment will build up and spill out, it's bound to happen if you have no positive outlet to work through this stuff. If the only time you're around the trigger(the father) is when you're also around the 4 year old is pretty much guaranteed to spill out in front of her. It's not a deliberate act to try and hurt the 4 year old. It's literally just cause and effect. The only ways to avoid that happening are if she were to attend therapy funded by someone (cause that shit can be expensive), go no contact, or have op make a genuine effort to heal things. \n\nYou can have your opinion just as ill have mine but I'll never fault the product of shitty parenting more than I'll fault the shitty parent.

It's a thing that happens in normal families, and it's not being mean to the younger child, discovering that your siblings and your parents don't always get along.", "He also states that his oldest is taking her frustrations out on his youngest, but the only example he gives is that a 16 year old didn't connect well with a toddler and that she dated to talk to him about something within earshot of the youngest. The title of the post is nothing more than an attack on his oldest with no proof, or did your supposedly great reading comprehension miss that there was literally no negativity directed at the kid just at dad?\n\nETA: By the way, you keep adding the word beginning to what it says in the post even though that is not there. So maybe you should reread the post? Your comprehension of what was actually said seems to be a little off.\n\nETA2: Since you replied and then blocked me right away: \n\nDidn't give examples so he wouldn't throw her under the bus, yet the title is doing exactly that? \n\nOh and I had a fine childhood with loving parents thank you very much. We may not have been super well of, but the love was always there and also shared when things were not going as perfectly as they wished.", "Which is what I said at first.", "Well that view probably doesn\u2019t help the abused kids whose parents couldn\u2019t break the cycle, but you do you. The blame game is childish and unhelpful. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve said clearly and repeatedly it\u2019s nothing to do with not playing with her, it\u2019s the deliberately vengeful comments. But if you give a free pass to anyone who had a bad upbringing I guess you can overlook anything, just don\u2019t act surprised when they perpetuate mistreatment.", "No she wants the 4 year old to hear how she didn\u2019t have a dad to try and damage that relationship. That\u2019s different.", "I think you answered your own question\u2026 he didn\u2019t give examples. Probably to not throw his daughter under the bus.. Anyone with a brain can interpret that whatever she says in front of the four-year-old is either out of line or hostile or done to create tension which the 4 year old probably picks up on\u2026. Clearly you had a messed up childhood and you were projecting your own experiences onto this dad who is simply just trying to do better."]}
