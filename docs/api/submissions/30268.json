I had my oldest daughter(21F) when I was around 17, her brother at 20, and then my youngest 4 years ago with my wife. I was not a great father up until I got custody of my son when he was three. I was not in my daughters life consistently until she was around 10 when I moved to be closer to her. When she was 12, her mother passed and she moved in with me and my son. When my daughter was about 15, I married my current wife and we had a baby a year later. I wanted this to be different and it is. I am giving my second daughter the father my first didn't have. As a result, there has been some tension between from my oldest. She frequently gets upset seeing my be a parent to my youngest as she didnt get that. She also frequently is mean to my youngest. My youngest loves her big sister with all of her heart, and my oldest is incredibly cold to her and always has been. Before my oldest went off to college I tried to foster a good relationship between the two, I made sure to not make my oldest a default babysitter but encouraged her to spend time with her.\n\nThis tension boiled over two nights ago when she was visiting and we got into an argument. I was playing with my youngest and my oldest went on about how lucky she is that she gets to have this time with me since she never did. I don't like to have these discussion in front of my youngest. She may be 4 but she's old enough to know when theres tension even if she doesn't fully understand why. She kept pushing and escalating the pressure until she snapped. She went off about how unfair it is that I'm there for her while I wasn't for her. She said my youngest will never have to struggle like she and her mom did and it's not right that she gets a dad.\n\nI told he she was right to be upset with me. I was not there for her like she needed and I will forever there is no justification for what I did other than the fact that I was young and immature. I told her that there is not an amount of words or times that I can tell her that I'm sorry enough to undo the damage I have done and that I will never forgive myself for not giving her what she needed while she was a kid. However, I told her that she needs to stop blaming her sister for this. None of this was her fault, and she doesn't know anything right now and this is not something she should have to think about until she's older. Things escalated into a crying yelling fit where she said I was invalidating her feelings. I tried to comfort her but she was not having any of it and stormed to bed telling me she'd be gone in the morning.\n\nI do feel awful of course, however I don't think I was wrong to say what I said. Theres a time and place for that, and it wasn't in our living room while I'm playing with her sister.

She\u2019s home from college. Do you take her out to dinner, go to a movie, spend 1:1 time with her? Do you know the names of her roommate/s, friend/s and boyfriend? What classes is she taking? What time do you spend with just her?", "This is one of those times where it doesn\u2019t matter if your TA or not. \n\n\nYou and your oldest daughter most likely need to go to family therapy together. Seeing you parent and interact with your youngest daughter is hurting her badly enough that you asking her not to react poorly in front of her little sister is pointless. She doesn\u2019t seem to be getting over it herself, she probably needs professional help. You both do.", "Im really sorry to point this out but even when you are apologising to eldest you are still making it about 4y . This is just building more resentment. Keep the dialogue with oldest strictly on you and accountability for the past actions.  When she compares bring it back to you realising your crappy history and while you cant change past, you want to build a healthy relationship with oldest from this point forward.  \nYou cant turn back time but you can change the future. Im in similar situation. It does get easier but you have to atone. I was Shitty parent but brilliant grandmother.  We are great 90% of the time now. Occasionally she will be triggered seeing me do something with grandies and make offhand comment. I ALWAYS  acknowledge i know that i was shitty and that will plague me everyday until i kick the bucket. Our inside joke is that i can chase the 'good parent bus' all day and will never catch it BUT im the driver of the 'good granny bus'. Edited to add kudos for realising you're past mistakes", "YTA. Your whole vibe here is very \"yeah I was a crap parent but oh well too late now [shrug emoji]\" and then you're upset that she's not willing to shrug emoji back at you and move on like you want to do.\n\nHave you taken real accountability? Beyond just saying yeah I should've done better for you? Had a real conversation about it, not about why you did what you did, but about the effect it had on her? Without focusing on minimizing and deflecting?\n\nShe lost her only real parent at a very young age, and got dumped on her deadbeat dad who she knew damn well hadn't wanted her. She spent the rest of her childhood growing up as the unwanted child of the family, knowing she was only there out of obligation. Stop for a second and imagine what that will do to someone. The kind of deep, deep scars that will leave.\n\nShe is in tremendous pain right now, and you only care about it to the extent that it affects the daughter you actually wanted to have. Do you not see why she's upset with you? Have some empathy, ye gods.\n\nTherapy - both together and individually - is the only way you have even a prayer of fixing this, if that's really your goal.", "YTA you know how you help that tension? Actually give a shit about your oldest too.", "YTA - I want you to stop and do a little math. Your daughter was almost the same age you were when she was born, and you did not want to have a baby in your life at that age. Well, newsflash: neither does she. \n\nExpecting your oldest daughter to bond with a sister 16 years younger is a huge expectation. Your youngest was born when your oldest was learning to drive. Your youngest was potty training when your oldest was graduating high school. Your oldest is now almost old enough to legally drink, and your youngest probably still can't even tie her own shoes. \n\nWhile I am glad you own your bad parenting, that doesn't change that every time your daughter sees you being a father to a young girl she has resentment. The thing is, I don't think you are as self-actualized as you think. You say your shitty actions come from being young and immature, but don't respect that her actions come place. I also question if you truly feel that your older daughter is taking her anger out on your younger daughter, or if you are really embarrassed that your older daughter is covering your ass so that your younger daughter only sees you as a hero father and not the flawed human being that we all are.", "YTA. We get it, your youngest is your do over kid and your priority. \n\nYour oldest daughter wants to feel like a priority too.", "You claim to own up to your mistakes, but what kind of father you've been to your daughter for the 5 years she's been with you? Have you tried to mend things during this time? Or did you only start to be a father to your do over kid?", "Wow okay. NTA for giving the younger daughter a good experience and NTA for wanting to keep her out of it and foster good relationships\n\nYTA however because you haven't tried to look at this from your oldests daughter's point of view. You weren't there, you weren't interested. The only reason she's with you is because her mother died and you got 'stuck' with her. Now she's in a home watching someone else get everything you never wanted to do, and never would have if her mum was still alive. I totally understand her resentment towards your youngest, even if it is misplaced. I think you're saying all the right things but I don't think your oldest feels it at all. You've got a lot of bridges to mend, and I don't think reprimanding her because of her attitude will help.", "YTA. Your oldest daughter is devastated because of how much you love and care for your youngest. She never had that from you and she gets it shoved in her face every time she sees you. You are your oldest daughter\u2019s only parent and you still can\u2019t give her the love and attention she has always wanted from you. Until you attempt to repair your relationship with your oldest, she won\u2019t want anything to do with your precious youngest. All that time and energy you are putting into being a good parent to your youngest, you should be tripling that with your eldest. Your daughter is broken - she had a mom who died and is left with a dad who only has eyes for his youngest. You contributed to breaking this kid, now work your ass off to help her heal.", "Therapy. For her. For you. For her and you.", "Hey I was a bad dad but you don\u2019t get to show your feeling cause I\u2019m showing how good of a dad I am now and rubbing it in your face \n\nYTA\n\nShe clearly was upset but you choice to tell her not time and place was rude your the problem you caused her to feel less then she is.   You should of worked on your relationship with your oldest", "OP go to therapy not Reddit. Everyone here wants you to neglect your youngest in favor of your oldest. Or they just assume that you\u2019ve been ignoring your older daughter since she\u2019s moved in with you. Ask your older daughter if she\u2019s willing to working through your issues together in therapy and start there", "YTA because I think you are invalidating her feelings and showing favoritism towards your youngest. It\u2019s sounds like you want to sweep her feelings under the rug so you don\u2019t have to face the truth. She is probably still grieving the loss of her mother and home and having to adjust to all these new family members. This family needs therapy.", "Coming from a girl with an absent father, this is what I think would help me feel better: \n\n- A genuine apology taking full accountability, and conveying your emotion about the entire situation. She needs to hear in your voice that you regret your actions. The apology cannot feel forced \u2014 it has to feel full of love. Do not mention your youngest in this apology. It should be just about you and your oldest. \n\n- Better your relationship NOW. You can\u2019t change the past but you can get to know her now. Spoil her. Treat her like an (age appropriate) princess. It\u2019s okay that she\u2019s older now because you\u2019re making up for lost time. Make a point to spend quality time with her and be the dad now that she wished she had earlier. \n\n- She\u2019s insecure about your love for her so you need to remind her of it often. Send her random texts to let her know you think of her while she\u2019s at school. Ask her how she\u2019s doing. Give her frequent hugs when she\u2019s at home. Buy her little gifts when you can. Be consistent. That way, she can start to trust that you and your love for her aren\u2019t going anywhere. You\u2019re here to stay. \n\n- Enroll in family therapy so you and her have a safe place to hash out your emotions. There are some things that might need to be said or worked through and a good professional can help. \n\nTry to remember your oldest is a girl who was abandoned by her father by choice, and her mother through death. She feels utterly alone and she can\u2019t accept her sister\u2019s love right now because what she needs is a parent\u2019s love. Go all out for her. She deserves it. \n\nYTA right now but you don\u2019t have to be forever.

However, you own up to that, and your comments show that you do try to make up for it to your oldest as best as you can.

Perhaps some family therapy for just the two of you is in order to start working through some of this resentment your daughter harbors. It sounds like you're supporting her physical needs but maybe you're not as in touch emotionally as she'd like you to be, so she's lashing out at her sister who she sees as having a stronger bond with you. If that isn't an option, maybe just more one-on-one time where you ask her openly what she'd like you to do to start being the father she needs- clearly she feels as if you're still lacking if the pain from all those years ago is that raw, and maybe it's as simple as a little extra communication from you or some additional validation that she's special to you the way your littlest one is. \n\nI don't think you're TA but I do think you need to work on your relationship.", "Are you prioritizing time with your older daughter now\u2026 do you just spend one on one time getting to know her.. have you gone to therapy with her.., \n\nSomething tells me no\u2026 you are focused on the new daughter.. \n\nI would be highly upset as well.. and yes I would be jealous of the 4 yr old as well.\n \nIf mom hadn\u2019t passed away older daughter would probably never see you.\n\nYTA.. prioritize your older daughter for once..", "Are you active in your oldest daughter's life now?

A lot of comments here are ignoring how this is affecting the little girl. It\u2019s not about protecting your feelings, but hers. If older sister doesn\u2019t want to have a relationship with her sister then she shouldn\u2019t have to, but then there needs to be firm boundaries. Separate your time with them as much as you are able. When the oldest is around the youngest she has to be cordial. She cannot be starting fights in front of the four-year-old. If she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with her sister then respect that and structure your life accordingly.", "YTA. You were invalidating her feelings.

She's less likely to start the convo in front of sis if you start it at a better time. Have you asked what you can do to be here for her now, and have you continuously followed through with doing it? She won't need to be as jealous of sis getting your care and attention if she's also getting some. Of course, she may say it's too late and she doesn't want/need anything now, but you have to make it clear the offer is open and always will be, and respect her wishes when she does express them.\n\nI really recommend going to family therapy if you can.", ">I am giving my second daughter the father my first didn't have.\n\n...Are you serious right now?

But that would've taken work and you don't seem to be interested in that.\n\nYTA. Hugely. The resentment your oldest feels toward her sister is squarely YOUR fault.

All you said was \"not now.\" I'm sure she's used to hearing that from you though.", "There's a lot of emotion involved and your daughter probably needs some therapy to help unpack it.\n\n  \nNo the 4 year old doesn't deserve any of this and she's the innocent party but there is a lot of unresolved trauma for your daughter and it's a really hard thing to put past when you missed out on so much that you are seeing your sister get.  Also don't forget that her mother died so it's not like she even has her.  In her eyes the 4 year old has two attentive parents and a charmed life v's what she needed to deal with at the same age.  That's not her fault either.\n\nYou actually need a third party to navigate this.  Your eldest sounds like she's really struggling with this.\n\nYour words weren't wrong - you acknowledged your behaviour was wrong and you can't change the past.  I can see why she would feel in validated but time has passed and you are not the same person you were 20 years ago and your circumstances are not the same either.\n\nYou probably need to focus on building your relationship with your eldest as just the two of you and stop expecting her to have a relationship with the 4 year old at this point.  That will hopefully come in time.\n\nJust the two of you together to get to know each other... and some family therapy (just the two of you again - don't involve the others, your son would be the next one to involve but leave your wife and 4 year old out of this initial stage of rebuilding your relationship).  So it will be doing stuff together and talking.  \n\nShe has no obligation to have a relationship with anyone and she can't have one with her youngest sibling then this is something that you will have to accept.   She can't be mean and nasty to her though.  Family get togethers may be a bit awkward if the 4 year old expects it so you're going to have an age appropriate talk with her.

I actually think that my little brother helped my dad grow as a person and be a better man. We were able to really work through the resentment. He's more present and active in all of our lives.

If the only times she sees him are also always with the kid in tow I can completely understand it bubbling up and over at this point. The woman needs therapy and honestly it'd probably be best for her to go low or no contact for at least a bit. If they're gonna keep a relationship though it has to be seriously and genuinely talked about, not just in a \"I know I was shitty, I can't change that, stop talking about it in front of your sister.\" \n\nNot to mention it sounds like the only way she's actually taking anything out on the 4 year old is simply by not really interacting/ being as close to her as op would like. The comments she's making aren't being mean to the 4 year old, she's saying the kids lucky, if anything they're just digs at op. Which while isn't exactly appropriate, once again if they don't have time away from the kid to hash out, is bound to happen. Personally I can't judge someone to much for being a bit harsh towards a shitty parent, especially if there's never been a genuine attempt on the parents side to listen, take ownership, and try to mend the relationship between parent and child. It gets worse when you remember that the only reason he started being a more permanent fixture in her life was because her mother died, not because of a want to rebuild the relationship.", "Knowing that her father wasn't a good one to her sister is not gonna 'damage' her.", "He didn't want anything to be different before that.

As opposed to many posts here, this one doesn't try to hide the poop, and that makes mee find OP believable.\nOP tries to foster a good relationship between his daughter and her half-sister, but I don't know if that's possible (right now). NTA for trying to get daughter to aim her anger and frustration at OP as opposed to the toddler.\nDaughter is NTA for not feeling heard; in her situation I can totally understand.\nSo right now NAH; in the past the asshole is obvious, but the asshole knows.\n\nThe daughter has been dealt an extremely shitty hand at life: an absentee father, and a mother she lost way to early. She's absolutely right to think life was unfair to her. Her anger and frustration hurts the people around her, but probably herself as well. To lose that, sadly, I don't think there's anything dad can do. He can and should try always, but the can't take away the years he wasn't there. That means the work to let this go is on herself, which again is very unfair. Dad can and should help in this by providing therapy (when she asks) and joining in if necessary. I could also imagine times there'd be less or no contact to avoid the pain, and dad should accept that as well.\n\nVery relatable: my wife's father was a US soldier stationed in Europe. Lack of proper communication between him and my MIL ensured they never got back together and he remarried in the US.

If they don't then it seems less deliberate and vengeful and simply more the product of what happens when you're a shitty parent to a child that grows onto an adult while watching you be what they wanted their whole life. That's why I said she should stop contact with op. If he's not going to give her the time of day to actually try to fix things and be a present parent now, this is an obvious result. The resentment will build up and spill out, it's bound to happen if you have no positive outlet to work through this stuff. If the only time you're around the trigger(the father) is when you're also around the 4 year old is pretty much guaranteed to spill out in front of her. It's not a deliberate act to try and hurt the 4 year old. It's literally just cause and effect. The only ways to avoid that happening are if she were to attend therapy funded by someone (cause that shit can be expensive), go no contact, or have op make a genuine effort to heal things. \n\nYou can have your opinion just as ill have mine but I'll never fault the product of shitty parenting more than I'll fault the shitty parent.

Was never in my life and never tried to be. When I was 15 or 16 I got in with a bad crowd. Started doing drugs. I told my mother and she gave me an option, I can go to the mental hospital that I absolutely hated or I could go stay with my dad for some time because he was states away and I'd be cut off from access to drugs and the people influencing me to do it. I chose to go to my dad. At this point he was married and had a step daughter a year older than me. We thought he had changed. He picked me up from the airport and the first thing he said to me was \"oh I thought I was getting your brother\" because my brother was always his favorite. He made my life hell. Beat me, was constantly drunk and screaming at me. His wife was lovely though and always tried to help me. One day he beat me especially bad and I left. Stayed with an old friend of my mother until she could get a plane ticket and bring me back home. I never spoke to him again. Then he died.

There is nothing you can do to give her her childhood back and she needs to accept that. She is only 20 though so she's young and still immature. Luckily the gen z kids are quite willing to go to therapy. Ease her into it, maybe offer to go with her to group sessions as well as solo sessions. If she won't that's on her. You can't help someone that doesn't want it. Just try to be there for her now. Maybe take her to do things she missed in her childhood. Take her to build a bear or an amusement park or something if you can. Keep doing what you've been doing, include her as much as possible and spend time with her.

You said new kid was your chance to start again, but you had five years with your eldest before youngest even came around, what were those years?\n\nI think making the situation about her not saying things in front of baby sister, to her, proved her point.

The fact that she is struggeling this much at 21, after you had five years to focus on her and a relationship with her before little sister was even in the picture, and some of your comments about starting over with little sister and not for older sister when she was 12, speaks to this being the consequenses of your actions well past when you were 17. It doesnt sound like you were able to meet her needs or make her a priority, or help her get access to the tools she needed to work on her own emotional trauma and help regulate her feelings. Those five years were so important to this child who lost one parent and had to live with the other one that abandoned her and she hardly knew. That sounds so harrowing and hard to deal with for someone that young, she would have needed so much support, therapy and undivided attention to build trust and self worth. And in that time you got married and had another baby.\n\nI am making a lot of assumptions based on what little you have written. I might be entirely off base.

I had parents that treated me as an obligation and someone to go to the deli to buy soda, a newspaper, cigarettes, a tomato, and a racing form until I was a teen and then they just had to do their time waiting for me to finish school and leave. I watched my mom move heaven and earth for my younger sister (and only 3 year difference) and fully engage as a 2nd parent fully involved in all activities for her kids (loser dads so yeah not a 3rd). In my 20\u2019s I found it hard. But I got over it with time and growing up.

I think it's reasonable to want to protect the younger sibling but also I'm just curious when there would be a good time to bring up this issue, especially since it's so likely to come up when you are parenting your kid constantly which is obviously a trigger for the oldest.

She is not by logic blaming the kid and so she can't just stop. So simply demanding her to control emotions she apparently can't is uncaring and an asshole move.

I agree that the oldest should distance herself.

He was a better dad to me in some ways and I did have a better mom, and some were bitter towards me or him. They were forced to grow up a lot younger and have more independence at a very young age, where I was more dependent in my teens and I feel like that set me up for success as I didn't have to stress out about money or my future when I was too young (I'm now well educated, have a good job, and am independent).\n\nTwo of my siblings stopped talking to him 10 years ago, despite his many efforts to reconnect.

Most people are not parents while still children, so we don\u2019t know how well they\u2019d manage.", ">But it\u2019s convenient that some young parents are able to do that right from the jump and get their shit together and try their best, but others \u201cneed to grow and change and mature first\u201d lmao let\u2019s not excuse this deadbeat. He\u2019s taken accountability, don\u2019t let him off Scott free. And from the perspective of the kid it IS painful.\n\nDo you believe that everyone, in fact, matures at exactly the same rate, regardless of circumstances and experiences and what have you? And that people, in general, are not different and individuals?", "Wow, I hope OP reads this. But I also want OP to hold his oldest daughter and let her know he loves her.  He wants the best for her. He's there for her. She desperately needs your attention. Get to know your oldest like you've never done before. Persue her. Just because she's 21 doesn't mean you can't build a relationship. You're her only parent. She likely feels alone in this world.", "You just described me except the \"new baby\" is the woman my dad married who is younger than me. It's so dysfunctional and hard to watch. He gives her the world and she still complains that she doesn't get the things my sister and I have. Well yeah that's because my sister and I worked our asses off our whole lives to get where we are. Nobody coddled us. I checked out for a long time. I had to. Now I've got two kids and my dad loves to be their grandpa so I foster that relationship for them because my kids love it so much. But he has chosen to compartmentalize his whole existence and it's painful to watch. In some ways I feel some anger and disappointment relent seeing him be a good grandpa. But he still has his \"other daughter\" and she micromanages his life so we only get part of him.", "u/BenjaminGhazi99", "I have this exact experience, my little brother and sibling get two someone well adjusted parents who love them. Long story short I got shit and just blame my mom, my little sibling doesn't deserve my bad attitude.", "I went through this with my dad. He was a shitty dad and I just resigned myself to the fact that he didn't have it in him. Until he remarried when I was in my 30s and his teenage stepsons got everything I never did- he went to their parent teacher meetings, concerts, etc. \n\nThe thing I struggle with is that people change. Maybe my dad wasn't capable of it with me, but he is capable of it now. It doesn't make him less of a shitty dad to me, but it's not fair to say he could have done it all along when frankly, maybe he *couldn't* have. \n\nIt doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. And it doesn't mean it's easy to get over. But it's A Thing.", "This is so true. I still remember vividly when my brother and I came across our father - whom we weren't in contact with at that time for good reason but attended the same events - not very long after the divorce calling this kid \"sonny\". He made himself a little new family.   \nI asked him about it when I attempted to reconnect years later and he claimed that the kid called him dad and that's why he called him sonny.  This an excuse I don't buy as no kid calls his mom's new fling who has been a few months in his life dad without something being seriously wrong and any responsible adult would curb that.", "It reminds of this quote on The Good Place\n\n*Because I wanted that mom! I wanted the mom who made me afternoon snacks instead of just telling me to look for loose fries in the McDonald's ball pit. Why does Patricia get that mom? If Donna Shellstrop has truly changed, then that means she was always capable of change, but I just wasn't worth changing for.*\n\nIt's stuck with me ever since I watched it. A parent who shows up for others but never you. It's a hard thing to see. Op you need to do some work if you want a relationship with your oldest. I'd highly recommend therapy IF your oldest wants to.", "This is why, at the very start of the conversation, the little one should have been sent to another room or to do something else. Because it\u2019s very clear this was going to happen after the first comment and using your 4YO as a shield to push that conversation back or dismiss someone who clearly wants to have such a conversation - no matter if you really intended to have the conversation at a later date - is a shit move.", "They didn't even read the story. Her starting an argument with dad IN FRONT OF THE TODDLER about how dad wasn't there for her as a kid is proof enough that it's much more than sibling rivarly.", "Yes, but his mistake was not removing himself and oldest from the situation. I completely agree 4 year old needs to be protected from the resentment. What he did though, was insist the resentment wait until a more appropriate time. Which is not possible. 4 year old has a good dad and a good mom. Hand 4 year old to good mom, and deal with the damaged young women who doesn't really have either. Show her he can be a good dad to her too by having 1 on 1 time with her. It's wonderful that he changed, but this just broke my heart for her.", "If your argument was valid, you wouldn\u2019t need to water down and make what the older sister is doing a generic sadness. And I think you\u2019ll find that the sexism exists in the way that many responders to these forums operate massive double standards.", "But he still making the same mistake", "No. But feelings don't care about logic. And some wounds are soul deep. He made choices and her wounds were the price of them and now, by all accounts, it's his duty to do everything in his power to fix them as a parent should.", "I think that's a very mature and nuanced way of thinking about it. For whatever \"reasons\" (immaturity, addiction, fear of failure) your dad was not capable of the actions needed to be a good father, but since he isn't a complete monster he was able to recognize what he did was wrong, he began to make changes, maybe it was even something in his relationship, however bad it was, with you that gave him the impetus, the reason, to change his ways. Then when the new mature, capable version of your dad was given an opportunity to use these new capabilities, he embraced the chance to show everyone how different he is now. In a way you should be proud of your dad, not everyone is able to change, some people really are just rotten, evil people; your dad is a good person who made big bad mistakes but at least he isn't incorrigible.", "Deadbeat dads man. My FIL is on the prowl to start his third family. My husband and his two brothers are the first family. He abandoned them, moved across the country, and found the woman to start family number two at a strip club. They had one son. That woman, a real peach, got hooked on pain pills. Well, they both did. She left him. So now he's shacked up with a gal young enough to be his daughter and they're living the junkie life together. He was talking about wanting to start a family and wallowing in his self pity for having failed two families already. The third must be the answer. Like Jesus dude can't you look around and see the mountain of suffering you've caused four people already?", "How do you know? She\u2019s clearly bitter and vengeful.", "Thank you for this answer, i've reading most of what other posters have said and I don't understand how can they not see that there are two issues that should be treated differently. \nThe fact that he was an asshole to his eldest is obvious, but the fact that they think that it is appropiate to let a 21 years old lash out in front of a 4 y.o is baffling.", "Of course, he can't, he is the center of the universe.   \nIt didn't last either with my dad and his new lady whom he \"defiantly didn't cheat with nono he just went to the other side of the country to see her as a friend despite his brother living nearby\"  \nI had to cut him off before my wedding because he was gearing up to make drama and provoke my family (he said things like \"if they say anything I'm not just gonna sit and take it!\" - all anyone said was \"that's so great for you!\" learning he was attending my wedding)  \nNow he is jumping from woman to woman - and how do I know being NC? Well, he reached out on Facebook saying \"I know you do not want anything to do with me waah waah waah\" and checking his profile it always coincides with a new relationship. He blames my mom to this day, claims she was abusive - she wasn't, he was -and the best example of woe is me. His evil ex wife ruined his life turning his evil selfish children against him  \nIronically his biggest fear was ending up like his dad: dying alone with none of his children wanting anything to do with him. Now he will die alone by his own doing", "Sometimes you say your thoughts out loud. By the sounds of it, it was the dad who pushed it further. She might have just made the comment and then let it go. But the dad was ashamed, didn\u2019t want his youngest to hear how shitty he was and it in his words it escalated.", "Reddit logic to try and give anyone a pass because they\u2019re \u201ctriggered.\u201d"]}
