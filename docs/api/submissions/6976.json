Me and my fiance told all our families and friends we would be having a lot of rules and they all assured us they were fine with it. At that time we hadn't discussed the rules yet, we just knew it would be very strict. Me and my fiance carefully chose the rules and in total there was about 30 rules. Some of the rules were \"Women wear pale yellow dresses & men wear black suits\" \"Only seafood and vegan food\" \"No camera/recording\" \"No children below the age of 12\" I know these are kinda strict but I made sure everyone understood that if they can't meet most of these, then they are not welcomed in my wedding. Me and my fiance also decided we would only invite the closest of closest family and friends (which would be around 70 relatives and friends in the wedding). My fiance worked on finding a nice beach to have our wedding in and I worked on making every invitation by hand. The invitation cards included every rule. We expected our families to be happy and excited about our wedding but instead we got a lot of backlash. My MIL was very angry saying that she didn't have any yellow clothes. My BIL said he doesn't like seafood and is allergic to most vegan foods. My uncle said his children will be very upset that they can't come so on and so on. Basically almost every family member wanted to go against most of the rules and I didn't know what to do because I didn't want to change the rules nor did my fiance. Time was running out so we postponed the wedding going from 1 weeks to 2 months. Our families were again upset saying they already waited long enough for the wedding and said I was in the wrong for causing a \"mess\" when I could have just reduced the rules and/or made them less strict and stupid and that they never even knew it would be THAT strict. They told me unless they allowed them to do more things freely then they are not coming and that why would they even follow so many things for a 3 hour party. I tried explaining to them that we are working on it but they don't stop talking about it even sometimes behind my back. They always make harmful jokes about and the one time I stand up for myself they call me pathetic and that it was all me and my fiances fault.
