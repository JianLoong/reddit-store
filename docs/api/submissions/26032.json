{"id": 26032, "submission_id": "167gde0", "title": "AITA for kicking my cousin out over my cat", "selftext": "So I 37f was very close to my 37f cousin as we were born within months. Early this year her then fiance kicked her out to move his side chick in. Becky then asked to move in with me.\n\nI have a cat that I found hiding inside my car. Gar is my baby and I adore him. He was a little hesitant when Becky moved in but warmed up to her. Gar started acting weird. I wasn't sure what was up so I took him to the vet. She said it might be a little anxiety still over Becky.\n\nJuly, she started making comments about thinking she was allergic to Gar as her eyes were itchy and watery. I felt bad telling her I'd buy her allergy medicine. But she said they weren't helping. So I started cleaning more trying to reduce the hair and dander more. I asked Becky if things were better and she said slightly but she was still suffering. She asked me to confine him to my bedroom so the common rooms were clear of him, I told her no.\n\nI had to leave for a few days for a baby shower. My plan was to go to the shower then visit with my friend. Half way through the shower my phone rang. I didn't know the number and figured if it was important they'd leave a message, and they did. I excused myself to listen, finding out it was a shelter the next county over. Apparently a woman dropped off my cat saying they found him. Gar is microchipped thank god.\n\nThe girl behind the counter explained and I just knew it was Becky. I arrived home and Becky seen me from the garage. Her face looked panicked as I got out. She said she was sorry but Gar got out and she hadn't found him.\n\nI said weird as \"blank\" county animal shelter said they had Gar. She shifted a little, when I asked what really happened. That was when the word vomit started. It ranged from her allergies to Gar being under foot all the time, to the stench of the litter box. I told her I have Gar and that she has two days to leave, I'm sure her mom would take her back. The waterworks started before she screamed stomping inside grabbing her keys and leaving. That was a week ago.", "created_utc": 1693596062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167gde0/aita_for_kicking_my_cousin_out_over_my_cat/", "score": 161, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The cat was here first. Becky had no right taking YOUR CAT to an animal shelter without your consent or knowledge. If she doesn\u2019t like the cat then she\u2019s welcome to leave but what she did was way out of line.", "you were too nice to give her the 2 days to leave. I would've kicked her out then and there \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Are you sure that the ex kicked her out for the side piece?  From the way she was acting, I would think he kicked her out for being manipulative!", "NTA\n\nNo one messes with my cat without consequences", "NTA ofcourse.\n\nAre you kidding me?! She dropped your cat somewhere? What an A.\n\nDo you still have stuff from here because she left in a hurry? I would take those things and leave them at a thriftstore. If she wants them than she can go and pick them up there.", "NTA and I\u2019m left wondering if Gar was acting funny because she was mistreating him when you weren\u2019t around. :(. She\u2019s trash and deserve no contact ever again.", "NTA god that's wierd\n\nI am ACTUALLY allergic to cats with a neighbour who's cat seems to love me for that very reason, and I still let him on me (allergy tablets in hand). There must be something more to this surely?", "NTA. Wow - Id have been so disgusted with her that she'd have been out the door immediately. I'd be sure to let the rest of the family know that she took my cat to the shelter while I was out of town. That was all kinds of horrible.", "NTA, cats are precious and she is definitely not.", "NTA\n\nWhat a disgusting excuse for a human.  You were very, very lucky to get Gar back.  \n\nI trust you'll never allow her back into your home in the future.", "NTA\n\nShe must walk bowlegged with balls that large!", "NTA.  What a snake in the grass!  She abandoned your defenseless cat at a shelter after you took her in after being homeless.  Outrageous!  Hope she is long gone!", "NTA.  She's not allergic. She has to go.", "NTA. I'm impressed you didn't choose violence. NO ONE fucks with my cat.\n\nI hope Gar is okay after being catnapped by Becky. Treats and scritches to him from this reddit stranger and cat lover.\n\nEdited: typed the wrong judgement because I wanted to yell at Becky in my head. Corrected to reflect my actual sentiment.", "NTA. Your cousin sucks.", "NTA. Cat tax?", "NTA you tried to help out your cousin with extensive compromises.  I feel sorry for her situation but anyone who would do that to your animal knowing how much you care about them is insane. I am hoping this is just a phase because she\u2019s having a rough patch and not something your cousin would normally do.", "NTA \u2014 you have your life, she has hers. She asked to move in because hers imploded and you obliged. That doesn\u2019r mean she gets to make a mess of yours too, or manipulate the situation so your lifestyle (cat included) fits in to her specifications.\n\nShe also lied to your face and has the nerve to try and make you pity her.\n\nSeriously, I\u2019m apalled. I\u2019m glad Gar\u2019s back with you.", "NTA. That is such a garbage thing to do to someone. Kick her to the curb.", "NTA!! Really, not even a tiny bit. Good on you for being a good pet parent  with the chip. I am glad you got your baby back. I happen to be horribly allergic to like EVERYTHING!!! Hives, itchy and swollen eyes, runny nose, the works. However, I love my dogs. That is why I take a once daily allergy pill. There are ways to prevent and alleviate these issues. The fact she went behind your back, lied, doubled down with the attitude, dont let her back any where near Gar!!!", "NTA \n\nThat entitled moron is an AH though.", "NTA OP. Becky YTA. Your cousin has lost a lot of life perspective. Steer clear of her moving forward. It seems she is on a rough path of poor decisions.", "NTA. That is a disgusting thing to do. Gar belongs with you, she can move on.", "NTA", "Nta\n\nYou're so much kind of and I am. If it had been me in your place, she would have been kicked out immediately and I might have punched her", "Cats are r/purrrfect", "My uncle came and got her stuff.

They won't elaborate.", "Also any car allergies activate IMMEDIATLEY not within seven months wtf", "Never, I'm just glad I microchipped him.", "He's doing fine, he's been spoiled to no end. I might have created a monster lol.", "Did you mean YTA?", "I second. I demand the cat tax!!", "That's though for her but it has nothing to do with you. She did this to herself and the fact that she 'thanked you' for letting her stay in your home by getting rid of your cat (and then lying about it to your face, bc if she had any little bit of guilt it would have come out when you stepped into the house) is terrible.", "Totally it's like 20 min", "Glad he's fine and being spoiled :). And sorry, I'd meant N T A obviously and accidentally typed Y T A.", "OOPS! Nope. Thanks for letting me know.", "HELLNO.\n\nShe's lucky she was able to leave on her own and not be wheeled out.\n\nI'm so glad you got Gar back!\n\nNTA", "NTA. You said he even started acting weird... I think she might have done something to him, sorry. I would have kicked her out on the spot.", "NTA.", "NTA. Gar was there first", "you gave her 2 days? id have given her 2 minutes. nta", "NTA.\n\nI can see why her ex fianc\u00e9 kicked her out.", "You may want to consider getting your locks changed, now that she's gone. NTA", "NTA. Not her cat, she had no right to give Gar to anyone.", "NTA. If anyone did that to my cat I would kick them out right away. Zero hesitation.", "The only thing you did wrong was giving her two days too many.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, Becky\u2019s got some nerve. Who does she think she is dropping YOUR cat at a shelter?", "NTA that was a rotten thing to do and she doesn't deserve anything from you", "Agreed. Becky was a real Richard to Gar, and hopefully the poor thing will be able to chase flies in peace, and meow how much he loves OP. References aside though,  Becky FA'd and FO'd. NTA", "Same. You don't mess with someone's pet/s. They are precious fur babies.", "With my foot to help her with the acceleration!", "I was going to say, well two people can be absolute garbage in a story. It's possible both her and her ex suck.\n\nBut you raise a good point. Someone evil enough to get rid of your cat? Lying about how they broke up with their ex is child's play compared to that.", "I bet you're right.  Poor baby Gar.", "Yeah that's so suspicious!
