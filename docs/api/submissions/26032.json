{"id": 26032, "submission_id": "167gde0", "title": "AITA for kicking my cousin out over my cat", "selftext": "So I 37f was very close to my 37f cousin as we were born within months. Early this year her then fiance kicked her out to move his side chick in. Becky then asked to move in with me.\n\nI have a cat that I found hiding inside my car. Gar is my baby and I adore him. He was a little hesitant when Becky moved in but warmed up to her. Gar started acting weird. I wasn't sure what was up so I took him to the vet. She said it might be a little anxiety still over Becky.\n\nJuly, she started making comments about thinking she was allergic to Gar as her eyes were itchy and watery. I felt bad telling her I'd buy her allergy medicine. But she said they weren't helping. So I started cleaning more trying to reduce the hair and dander more. I asked Becky if things were better and she said slightly but she was still suffering. She asked me to confine him to my bedroom so the common rooms were clear of him, I told her no.\n\nI had to leave for a few days for a baby shower. My plan was to go to the shower then visit with my friend. Half way through the shower my phone rang. I didn't know the number and figured if it was important they'd leave a message, and they did. I excused myself to listen, finding out it was a shelter the next county over. Apparently a woman dropped off my cat saying they found him. Gar is microchipped thank god.\n\nThe girl behind the counter explained and I just knew it was Becky. I arrived home and Becky seen me from the garage. Her face looked panicked as I got out. She said she was sorry but Gar got out and she hadn't found him.\n\nI said weird as \"blank\" county animal shelter said they had Gar. She shifted a little, when I asked what really happened. That was when the word vomit started. It ranged from her allergies to Gar being under foot all the time, to the stench of the litter box. I told her I have Gar and that she has two days to leave, I'm sure her mom would take her back. The waterworks started before she screamed stomping inside grabbing her keys and leaving. That was a week ago.", "created_utc": 1693596062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167gde0/aita_for_kicking_my_cousin_out_over_my_cat/", "score": 497, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The cat was here first. Becky had no right taking YOUR CAT to an animal shelter without your consent or knowledge. If she doesn\u2019t like the cat then she\u2019s welcome to leave but what she did was way out of line.", "you were too nice to give her the 2 days to leave. I would've kicked her out then and there \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Are you sure that the ex kicked her out for the side piece?  From the way she was acting, I would think he kicked her out for being manipulative!", "NTA\n\nNo one messes with my cat without consequences", "NTA ofcourse.\n\nAre you kidding me?! She dropped your cat somewhere? What an A.\n\nDo you still have stuff from here because she left in a hurry? I would take those things and leave them at a thriftstore. If she wants them than she can go and pick them up there.", "NTA and I\u2019m left wondering if Gar was acting funny because she was mistreating him when you weren\u2019t around. :(. She\u2019s trash and deserve no contact ever again.", "NTA god that's wierd\n\nI am ACTUALLY allergic to cats with a neighbour who's cat seems to love me for that very reason, and I still let him on me (allergy tablets in hand). There must be something more to this surely?", "NTA. Wow - Id have been so disgusted with her that she'd have been out the door immediately. I'd be sure to let the rest of the family know that she took my cat to the shelter while I was out of town. That was all kinds of horrible.", "NTA, cats are precious and she is definitely not.", "NTA\n\nWhat a disgusting excuse for a human.  You were very, very lucky to get Gar back.  \n\nI trust you'll never allow her back into your home in the future.", "NTA\n\nShe must walk bowlegged with balls that large!", "NTA.  What a snake in the grass!  She abandoned your defenseless cat at a shelter after you took her in after being homeless.  Outrageous!  Hope she is long gone!", "NTA.  She's not allergic. She has to go.", "NTA. I'm impressed you didn't choose violence. NO ONE fucks with my cat.\n\nI hope Gar is okay after being catnapped by Becky. Treats and scritches to him from this reddit stranger and cat lover.\n\nEdited: typed the wrong judgement because I wanted to yell at Becky in my head. Corrected to reflect my actual sentiment.", "NTA. Your cousin sucks.", "NTA. Cat tax?", "NTA you tried to help out your cousin with extensive compromises.  I feel sorry for her situation but anyone who would do that to your animal knowing how much you care about them is insane. I am hoping this is just a phase because she\u2019s having a rough patch and not something your cousin would normally do.", "NTA \u2014 you have your life, she has hers. She asked to move in because hers imploded and you obliged. That doesn\u2019r mean she gets to make a mess of yours too, or manipulate the situation so your lifestyle (cat included) fits in to her specifications.\n\nShe also lied to your face and has the nerve to try and make you pity her.\n\nSeriously, I\u2019m apalled. I\u2019m glad Gar\u2019s back with you.", "NTA. That is such a garbage thing to do to someone. Kick her to the curb.", "NTA!! Really, not even a tiny bit. Good on you for being a good pet parent  with the chip. I am glad you got your baby back. I happen to be horribly allergic to like EVERYTHING!!! Hives, itchy and swollen eyes, runny nose, the works. However, I love my dogs. That is why I take a once daily allergy pill. There are ways to prevent and alleviate these issues. The fact she went behind your back, lied, doubled down with the attitude, dont let her back any where near Gar!!!", "NTA \n\nThat entitled moron is an AH though.", "NTA OP. Becky YTA. Your cousin has lost a lot of life perspective. Steer clear of her moving forward. It seems she is on a rough path of poor decisions.", "NTA. That is a disgusting thing to do. Gar belongs with you, she can move on.", "NTA", "Nta\n\nYou're so much kind of and I am. If it had been me in your place, she would have been kicked out immediately and I might have punched her", "Cats are r/purrrfect", "My uncle came and got her stuff.

I might have created a monster lol.", "Did you mean YTA?", "I second. I demand the cat tax!!", "That's though for her but it has nothing to do with you. She did this to herself and the fact that she 'thanked you' for letting her stay in your home by getting rid of your cat (and then lying about it to your face, bc if she had any little bit of guilt it would have come out when you stepped into the house) is terrible.", "Totally it's like 20 min", "Glad he's fine and being spoiled :). And sorry, I'd meant N T A obviously and accidentally typed Y T A.", "OOPS! Nope. Thanks for letting me know.", "HELLNO.\n\nShe's lucky she was able to leave on her own and not be wheeled out.\n\nI'm so glad you got Gar back!\n\nNTA", "NTA. You said he even started acting weird... I think she might have done something to him, sorry. I would have kicked her out on the spot.", "NTA.", "NTA.

Zero hesitation.", "The only thing you did wrong was giving her two days too many.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, Becky\u2019s got some nerve. Who does she think she is dropping YOUR cat at a shelter?", "NTA that was a rotten thing to do and she doesn't deserve anything from you", "Agreed. Becky was a real Richard to Gar, and hopefully the poor thing will be able to chase flies in peace, and meow how much he loves OP. References aside though,  Becky FA'd and FO'd. NTA", "Same. You don't mess with someone's pet/s. They are precious fur babies.", "With my foot to help her with the acceleration!", "I was going to say, well two people can be absolute garbage in a story. It's possible both her and her ex suck.\n\nBut you raise a good point. Someone evil enough to get rid of your cat? Lying about how they broke up with their ex is child's play compared to that.", "I bet you're right.  Poor baby Gar.", "Yeah that's so suspicious!

You're better than me, I would have whooped her ass and put her put on the street that night.", "NTA, OP. You were a lot nicer than I would've been, I'll be honest. I've got a cat that wasn't even mine to begin with, she used to belong to my sister's ex. But that doesn't matter, she's mine now. If anyone tries to mess with this cat, they'll be sorry.", "NTA. Given what she did this was actually a very level-headed reaction. I'm so happy Gar is home where he belongs!", "NTA. Please tell us that you got your keys back?? \n\nWhether or not she\u2019s having a breakdown it was abysmal behaviour to drive out of your area to get rid of Gar. This was deliberate and designed so that her actions couldn\u2019t come back on her, but thankfully the shelter tracked you down.", "Dreadful, cruel, and untrustworthy. NTA.", "Glad you had him chipped or you may have never gotten him back. NTA, you gave her a place to live when she was homeless.  Get the locks changed ASAP.  She already tried to get rid of him once, what is to keep her from taking him again and dumping him in miles away from your home or worse in the hopes she can move in again.  Also file a police report, she stole your pet and placed in where he would be adopted by strangers.", "NTA. What a collosall bitch! She'd be out of my life forever. I wish she could be charged with theft or something.", "Absolutely NTA. This is unforgivable in my opinion. He could have died, and suffered greatly in the process. I would be furious and I don\u2019t think I could forgive her personally.", "NTA-I can see why her ex fianc\u00e9 got his side chick. Becky is cancelled for dropping a cat off to a shelter when it isn\u2019t her cat!", "NTA", "Nta That sounds traumatic", "NTA I'd have gotten her into the car with a promise of dinner and taken her to a shelter and dropped her off. Her crap would be waiting in garbage bags when she came back. Hope she shuts her shampoo in the shower and whatever food she had in the fridge was sealed.", "NTA I would never speak to her again", "Agreed. I'm also pretty sure that taking someone's animal to a shelter without their permission when they were in a safe home is illegal! That's not okay and I think that they handled it really well.", "I'm glad this has already been mentioned, because I have little doubt that Becky was behind it. Cats are sensitive to the emotional state of those around them. I'm sure Gar found it distressing when he discovered Becky has a hole where her heart should be.\n\nOP, if Gar still shows anxiety for a while, it could be he still smells Becky. A Feliway diffuser could help. It made a difference when I had a highly scent reactive cat.", "The only good thing Becky did was leave the cat at a shelter rather than dumping Gar by the side of the road.", "No it is called a spoiled brat temper tantrum.", "NTA\n\nWhat's up with all the /r/Entitledbeggars ?\n\nThis is a story that I've read too frequently on here.\n\nGlad your baby is home, safe and sound. Glad your problem is gone.", "A HUGE NTA! How dare she?!", "There are some really deranged people in this world!! Becky needs help, who does stuff like this to the person who took them in when they had no where to go?  \nNTA!!", "Nta\u2026that\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m so sorry you went through it. Would she have dropped your kid off at cps because she didn\u2019t like the fact a baby poops and cries?", "NTA. Giving her two days to leave was much kinder than I would have been. She\u2019d have been locked out immediately and I\u2019d have been throwing her stuff out the window.", "NTA. She stabbed you in the back. Maybe her ex kicked her out for a reason", "Becky would\u2019ve been the next one dropped off at a shelter. No one messes with my cat either. NTA.", "NTA.  Becky moved into Gar's home and then thought that he should have to be locked in your room so that she can be comfortable.  Then she had the audacity to take him to a shelter.  She has some nerve.  Thank God, you had Gar microchipped.", "Nta Good riddance. NOT TO GAR THO.", "NTA. Eff Becky.", "NTA , our furry kin are family. Take HER to to the shelter. And if you are not animal friendly stay somewhere else .", "op=NTA\n\nYour cousin is AH to the max for doing that to (you &) your cat.  \n\nI hope it was a NO KILL Shelter, but I doubt she'd be that careful--glad you had Gar Microchipped.", "NTA\n\nI think you handled it a thousand times better than I could have. I would be seeing red and hearing a high pitch sound and not processing human language. \n\nHow selfish and evil of her.", "OP your NTA your cousin is for trying to get rid of your cat when you left she never should have done that no matter what", "nta", "NTA.  I wouldn't have given her 2 days.  2 hours maybe. Then GTFO!", "Nta", "I would go APESHIT if someone did this to my cat. I couldn\u2019t be held accountable for what I would scream or possibly do.

You and Gar are very very lucky this has a happy ending. It could have even more likely had a horror ending.\n\nThis kind of thing is very common on AITA so always put your fur baby above house guests, our opinion.", "Same. Full-on mental breakdown style, throwing stuff out the window while screaming like a banshee.", "Her shit would have been outside that moment.", "Not necessarily.\n\nSaw a post on here. Woman had her fiance and his pregnant daughter (whose baby the woman would be taking care of) in her house with her elderly cat. She was even going to put her fiance on the house deed.\n\nFiance took her for a walk so that daughter and boyfriend could get rid of the elderly cat. \n\nInstead the woman found her cat and got rid of her fiance, pregnant daughter and boyfriend.\n\nThe fiance was going to get a free house. The daughter had a free place to live and free child care. But they lost it all because they couldn't wait for an elderly cat to die of natural causes.\n\nSome people are just wired wrong and feel entitled to do whatever they want.\n\nCousin is clearly one of them. Now OP knows.", "Forget home. I would never let her back in my life. She would be dead to me. I'm surprised OP didn't choose violence. I'm timid as hell but if you fucked with my cats I'd tear someone up.", "Yeah us too. Very much so.", "That's exactly what I was thinking.", "No, she's having a tantrum.", "He deserves it. I feel sure that Becky was mistreating him when you weren't around and that's why he was acting strange."]}
