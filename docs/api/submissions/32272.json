She has demonstrated that she will lie and slander and attack other people without cause or remorse. She has no basic morality or empathy. Therefore, continued association with her is dangerous to anyone around her. For your own safety and the safety of any future spouse or children, you can not in good conscience ever expose them to her and allow her to hurt them.\n\nForgiving someone is something you do for yourself. It does not require forgetting or allowing them an opportunity to repeat the vile behavior. NTA", "NTA", "NTA.

You are under no obligation to ever be in contact with her ever again.  She crossed the line horribly by her lies, accusations, and actions.", "NTA - there's no way I would forgive her. Her crazy self could've just told you that she actually didn't want you to stay with her. Instead she makes up a pretty serious accusation and after a year admits it was a lie? Why should you forgive her? Even if she apologized, which I didn't see that she did, I still wouldn't speak to her or be around her. She's ridiculous.\n\nEdited to add: being old isn't an excuse for lying or anything else.", "NTA.
