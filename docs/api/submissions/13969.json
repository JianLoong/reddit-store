No, it's not nice, but it's not the worst thing.\n\nHowever, you and your husband need to figure out parenting. are there rules in place? are they in counseling? why are you not able to discipline? etc", "NTA\n\nAll parents lose their cool sometimes. The question you need to ask them is what they \u201cheard\u201d you say & why do they think you lost your cool.\n\nYou say shut up... they hear \u201cshe doesn\u2019t like us\u201d. Always good to understand & be clear about everyone\u2019s perspective.\n\neta \u2014 also yelling at people about yelling is not very productive. Suggestion \u2014 next time turn off the television & speak directly about the issue.", "NTA, tricky situation and parents have their breaking points. I\u2019d just work to improve your communication with them going forward. Which is definitely easier said than done, but it would be good for you & the kids.", "I'm sorry but I kinda laughed reading your post lol. NTA OP! You just had a \"had it up to here\" moment about their yelling and what you said just popped out. \n\nHaving 3 siblings myself I wish I could tell you the yelling will get better and maybe in time it will but right now you are at the beginning of the prepubescent nightmare. I'd suggest on occasion you leave the kids with your hubby and have a nice girls wine date to keep yourself sane. Take care OP.. I hope things work out!", "NTA\n\nWe all have our moments where we get overstimulated, etc. Bioparents included.\n\nCould it have been handled a bit better? Sure, but I mean they're 10, 12 and 14. They've heard worse and they're not little children anymore.", "Not exactly TA. But you let something that irritted you get out of hand because you are the stepmother. You are their caretaker aswell and parents are there to guide and teach children what is apropriate or not. It's not even that, you teach and guide them in how to handle situations. Right now, they know how to handle conflict by starting to yell and scream. Though not wrong what you yelled, you did yell back.\n\nIt's hard, takes a lot of patience but seeing how you feel vad about yelling at them; when they get ibto an argument, talk with them. Talk it out instead of letting then scream it out. Teach them to listen to each other, understand each others feelings and how to resolve conflict. That is what will help them later on in life.\n\nAnd as their caretaker and stepparent, that is not overstepping on disciplinary actions or boundries with the kids. You are not punishing them by talking and resolving the issues with them. You are helping them grow up, you are therr for them and they will know you care and try to understand their feelings, no matter how insignificant they seem at the time.", "NTA\n\nYes, you snapped and yes, you could hav said it in a better way but it's only natural to snap, if they are really this noisy.\n\nJust one thing to add: It is your place to discipline them since it's your place where they live.It might not be your place to discipline them as a parent, since you aren't one but you make the rules in your home... Well you and your husband but you get the idea.", "NTA.", "You probably are their main female reference person and you should discipline them if it is necessary. NTA", "NTA. Everyone yells at their kid from time to time you get overwhelmed and it just happens. In my opinion the best way to handle this would be to sit them down, genuinely apologize for yelling and being rude, and discuss both sides. tell them that when they are yelling like that it is overwhelming for you and give them a chance to explain their side of the story. Its okay to admit faults to your children it is how they learn that it is okay to not be perfect. People make mistakes but its the way that those mistakes are handled that really makes the difference most of the time.", "NTA. Welcome to parenthood. You're human. At some point though, maybe you all sit down as a family and try to figure out the best way to communicate in future. What worked for me is telling them \"When you whine/yell, all I hear is...\" so it's really not an effective way to persuade me they're making a valid point. And when they do, I tell them to take a deep breath or two (or ten), try again in a normal tone of voice and maybe then we can discuss it. It's helped a bit...", "I think since you have custody of those kids you have the right to parent them. NAH", "NTA", "INFO- what about your husband? He doesn't do anything to discipline them?\n\nEDIT: either way NTA, but you felt bad yelling just try a different approach next time. Someone needs to give them education and discipline. You're a stepmother and have custody so it kind of is your job and right to do so.", "I mean, yeah YTA in this situation but maybe you're not an asshole in general. You can and should apologize to the kids and come up with some kind of noise management plan. Lots of patents wear earplugs in the house. It's possible the kids need more time outside. Stuff like that.", "Ya, you\u2019re kinda TA in this situation. But owning your mistake, showing you\u2019re human and as prone as anyone to having a bad moment, and making amends can make you very much NTA. Hope remains for an A-free win in this situation.", "NTA\n\nNo one is perfect! And we all snap at each other.\n\nGetting siblings, traumatised or not, to stop arguing all the time is virtually impossible. And boy is it annoying.", "NTA, you didn't verbally attack children, you called them out  Saying shut up is rude but you were at your breaking point. As a step parent I would suggest you and your husband discuss your role in discipline. Since bio mom is gone and you are a full time parent you can't just ignore discipline issues. It does more harm ignoring issues and waiting for dad to come home and then bring up problems that happened hours ago. Also, get used to sibling arguments over the stupidest things!", "YTA You yelled at them to stop yelling. Did you think that one through?", "Yta.", "You are doing great under the circumstances. And the kids need you to set boundaries even if you have to say shut up once in awhile. Obviously one respected this. Hang in there. Lots of love needed here.", "YTA- These children have just lost their mother and you are wondering why they act out?  How about a little family therapy? You, so you don't wait until you snap , and the kids for dealing with the loss of their mother?  You seem to think discipline is yelling at the kids or getting the behaviour you want without regard to them.  They are old enough for a little self management, but you are going to have to explain it to them and lay out the consequences.  How about sending them outside to play so they work off some of that energy?", "NTA - Kids are loud and far too often not told to shut up enough.\n\nTalk to them about the noise they make, tell them it's not acceptable and you don't want to have to yell over them yelling to be heard.", "NTA\n\nBut you should have chosen different words.", "Yta but sounds like you regret it. Yelling really shouldn't be the answer. If you're \"fed up to here\", take a break and go outside. Take a bath. If they get toonloud, separate them. They each have to play in their room for ten minutes. Sounds like you're trying you're best.", "If they are your step kids now then you have every right to discipline them when they act up or are fighting. Every parent yells at their kids when they are arguing and being loud. Does your husband discipline them?", "YTA", "NTA\n\nYour their stepmom and you have full custody along with your husband. IMO it is your place to discipline them. Although yelling at them to \"shut up\" isn't the best way to do that. Talk to your husband about this incident and your feelings of doubt about your role/responsabilaties as a stepparent. Also talk to your stepkids about you yelling at them and why you did it. They are old enough to have a conversation with.\n\nAlso make sure you have enough positive interactions with them. Take them out for bonding experiences or hangout with them around the house (cook together, watch tv). I get the feeling about overstepping boundaries or becomming the bad stepmom but your an adult watching kids that are sometimes going to misbehave. You correcting that behaviour or keeping it from escalating isn't overstepping imo.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I really hate to think this level of animosity is normal, but maybe it is.", "Thank you. I do feel I don't have the right to correct their behavior because I'm a stepparent, but from your reply and others I can see I should change my approach to them.", "He scolds them sometimes about other issues, but not for yelling and arguing.

She also needs to be able to parent and discipline the kids.

Everyone has a breaking point, and you\u2019re also allowed to set boundaries around acceptable behaviour in your home. If they\u2019re in your and your husbands custody maybe it might be time to teach them some interpersonal skills? I am watching Modern Family right now and I guess some kids do just fight.", "NTA. Regardless of the circumstances I think they\u2019re all old enough to be told to shut up when they\u2019re starting meaningless arguments. My parents did this as a warning to me and my brother growing up. When one of them told us to shut up that was a warning to stop now because if we keep going we\u2019re gonna get punished. It was nothing physical, something like grounding or taking someone thing away from us like a device.", "NTA, where is your husband in all this though?

I see a lot of people rushing to to tell you it\u2019s fine but I really don\u2019t think it is. Bio parents get eaten alive here for raising their voices too. You need apologize and game plan with your husband more appropriate responses. You are stepmom to children who\u2019s own mother died last year. I get being flustered and frustrated, I really do, but you still have to do better.", "Oh shut up with this noise.", "Kids, they are plenty old enough to keep it down\nwithout being yelled at.", "I'm one of 3. it is. I'm so sorry. but it is. it will get better as they get older, but not much. the fights will be less loud though.", "If you feel bad, you can always apologise for yelling but explain why you did? I\u2019ve lost it a couple of times with my little one, but I always sit with him after and say sorry for how I handled it and then talk about the issue.", "Agreed. I did fight with my sister sometimes, but we definitely weren't allowed to scream bloody murder in the house.", "I don't understand why you get downvoted.\n\nN T A means that OP isn't the A H but someone else is and if no one is one then the right judgment should be NAH.", "I don't think op not being an AH means someone else has to be. It sounds like she doesn't hold anything against the kids in a malicious way. And there are no comments on the husband being absent from the situation. \n\nOp feels bad for yelling at the kids and is asking for an outside pov on the situation. Sounds like she's trying to be introspective and trying to do her best. \n\nI think this is a rare no assholes here.", "> I don't think op not being an AH means someone else has to be.\n\nThe judgement 'NTA' suggests that someone other than OP is TA.\n\nNAH is the judgement if neither party is the asshole.", "If that's how you interpreted it. The post seemed more contained to op and her own actions than it did about anyone else's actions. In my view, that is.\n\nOp gave justifications for the children's behavior, so it doesn't seem like she's trying to paint someone specific as an AH. Just was she TAH for how she behaved?\n\nI believe op is coming from an honest and good faith position. Not interested in assigning blame, but hoping to improve after actions she feels make her at fault."]}
