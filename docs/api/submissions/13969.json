You just had a \"had it up to here\" moment about their yelling and what you said just popped out. \n\nHaving 3 siblings myself I wish I could tell you the yelling will get better and maybe in time it will but right now you are at the beginning of the prepubescent nightmare.

You are their caretaker aswell and parents are there to guide and teach children what is apropriate or not. It's not even that, you teach and guide them in how to handle situations. Right now, they know how to handle conflict by starting to yell and scream. Though not wrong what you yelled, you did yell back.\n\nIt's hard, takes a lot of patience but seeing how you feel vad about yelling at them; when they get ibto an argument, talk with them. Talk it out instead of letting then scream it out. Teach them to listen to each other, understand each others feelings and how to resolve conflict. That is what will help them later on in life.\n\nAnd as their caretaker and stepparent, that is not overstepping on disciplinary actions or boundries with the kids. You are not punishing them by talking and resolving the issues with them. You are helping them grow up, you are therr for them and they will know you care and try to understand their feelings, no matter how insignificant they seem at the time.", "NTA\n\nYes, you snapped and yes, you could hav said it in a better way but it's only natural to snap, if they are really this noisy.\n\nJust one thing to add: It is your place to discipline them since it's your place where they live.It might not be your place to discipline them as a parent, since you aren't one but you make the rules in your home...

Everyone yells at their kid from time to time you get overwhelmed and it just happens. In my opinion the best way to handle this would be to sit them down, genuinely apologize for yelling and being rude, and discuss both sides. tell them that when they are yelling like that it is overwhelming for you and give them a chance to explain their side of the story. Its okay to admit faults to your children it is how they learn that it is okay to not be perfect. People make mistakes but its the way that those mistakes are handled that really makes the difference most of the time.", "NTA. Welcome to parenthood. You're human. At some point though, maybe you all sit down as a family and try to figure out the best way to communicate in future.

As a step parent I would suggest you and your husband discuss your role in discipline. Since bio mom is gone and you are a full time parent you can't just ignore discipline issues. It does more harm ignoring issues and waiting for dad to come home and then bring up problems that happened hours ago. Also, get used to sibling arguments over the stupidest things!", "YTA You yelled at them to stop yelling. Did you think that one through?", "Yta.", "You are doing great under the circumstances.

You, so you don't wait until you snap , and the kids for dealing with the loss of their mother?  You seem to think discipline is yelling at the kids or getting the behaviour you want without regard to them.  They are old enough for a little self management, but you are going to have to explain it to them and lay out the consequences.  How about sending them outside to play so they work off some of that energy?", "NTA - Kids are loud and far too often not told to shut up enough.\n\nTalk to them about the noise they make, tell them it's not acceptable and you don't want to have to yell over them yelling to be heard.", "NTA\n\nBut you should have chosen different words.", "Yta but sounds like you regret it. Yelling really shouldn't be the answer. If you're \"fed up to here\", take a break and go outside. Take a bath. If they get toonloud, separate them. They each have to play in their room for ten minutes. Sounds like you're trying you're best.", "If they are your step kids now then you have every right to discipline them when they act up or are fighting. Every parent yells at their kids when they are arguing and being loud. Does your husband discipline them?", "YTA", "NTA\n\nYour their stepmom and you have full custody along with your husband. IMO it is your place to discipline them. Although yelling at them to \"shut up\" isn't the best way to do that. Talk to your husband about this incident and your feelings of doubt about your role/responsabilaties as a stepparent. Also talk to your stepkids about you yelling at them and why you did it. They are old enough to have a conversation with.\n\nAlso make sure you have enough positive interactions with them. Take them out for bonding experiences or hangout with them around the house (cook together, watch tv). I get the feeling about overstepping boundaries or becomming the bad stepmom but your an adult watching kids that are sometimes going to misbehave.

Noisy, always fighting, and screaming, is part of the job description many kids apparently got at birth. As you say, they are traumatised.
