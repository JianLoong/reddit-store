My wife has a younger sister, Beth (25F).  Beth and I don't get along very well, but we are cordial and she's a good aunt to our kids.  Beth got engaged to her high school sweetheart last summer and their wedding is scheduled for this coming summer.  \n\nBut last week, my wife came to me and told me that Beth wants to come stay with us for a while.  I immediately started asking questions because Beth lives over 2 hours away from us and usually plans visits out weeks in advance.  My wife told me that it is a personal matter and that I need to respect Beth's privacy in that regard.  I asked my wife how long Beth would be staying and she told me that she doesn't know and that all she will tell me is that the wedding is currently on hold and that Beth needs a place to stay for a bit.  \n\nI said that if I'm going to agree to an open-ended stay from someone who I don't get along with very well, I feel like I have a right to at least know why that person is going to be staying with us.  My wife told me that it's a personal matter and that she has agreed with Beth's request to keep it private and that if Beth wants to tell me about it, she will on her own.  \n\nI told her that I don't really feel comfortable with that kind of plan and that I would like some more information before I agree to it.  At that point, my wife got upset with me and told me that she isn't looking for my approval because she's already told Beth that she can come stay with us.  She reiterated that I need to respect Beth's privacy on this and that she needs me to just trust her on this.  \n\nI told her I do trust her, but that she's asking for a pretty big thing without giving me much information and that I don't feel comfortable going into something like this completely blind.  She said that Beth needs family support and we are the only ones who can give that to her.  (My wife's dad passed away during the pandemic and her mom is already in an assisted living facility).  \n\nShe told me that she needs me to just be caring and kind to Beth and to not bring up anything related to her engagement or wedding unless Beth brings it up to me first.  I told her that I don't appreciate being left in the dark about something that is resulting in another adult living in our house for an open-ended period of time.  \n\nShe told me that she just needs me to trust her and be supportive of her sister.  I kept trying to get more information but my wife eventually snapped at me to just stop asking questions because she's not telling me anything else and I need to just shut up and do this for her and her sister.  \n\nShe did immediately apologize, but told me that she needs me to do this for her because it's important and that she doesn't want to hear one more thing about why Beth is staying with us.  I tried to ask at least how long Beth would be staying, but she cut me off and said \"What the hell did I just say about questions?\"", "created_utc": 1675115776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pfbxv/aita_for_insisting_that_i_know_exactly_why_my_sil/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone is acting like it's obvious what is going on, but that doesn't seem to be the case to me at all. SIL has an emergency situation that requires privacy is all you know, and I do believe you reasonably should know why she is moving in:\n\n* Is SIL in danger? Is SIL afraid of her husband or suffering from domestic violence? Is SIL bringing danger to your own household?\n* Is SIL coping with mental health issues? Is your own family properly equipped to provide the help that she needs while maintaining your own wellbeing?\n\nTo me, \"SIL needs to stay with us, and the reasons are a deep secret\" is not sufficient. Yes there are other plausible explanations such as cheating that are embarrassing that SIL would prefer to keep private. But I believe your wife and SIL should provide more information for you to form your own comfort with the situation and understand what it is you're dealing with.

Beth is having serious problems with her fiance, doesn't know if she wants to go through with the wedding. Beth is in crisis and really needs your wife's support right now. Beth will not be talking to you about what specifically happened and your wife will respect her privacy because you would not be helpful in this matter. They don't know how long because it's a crisis and Beth is feeling so overwhelmed right now that she can't predict how long it will take for her to feel centered and make the decision she needs to make that will affect the rest of her life.

My wife has a younger sister, Beth (25F).  Beth and I don't get along very well, but we are cordial and she's a good aunt to our kids.  Beth got engaged to her high school sweetheart last summer and their wedding is scheduled for this coming summer.  \n\nBut last week, my wife came to me and told me that Beth wants to come stay with us for a while.  I immediately started asking questions because Beth lives over 2 hours away from us and usually plans visits out weeks in advance.  My wife told me that it is a personal matter and that I need to respect Beth's privacy in that regard.  I asked my wife how long Beth would be staying and she told me that she doesn't know and that all she will tell me is that the wedding is currently on hold and that Beth needs a place to stay for a bit.  \n\nI said that if I'm going to agree to an open-ended stay from someone who I don't get along with very well, I feel like I have a right to at least know why that person is going to be staying with us.  My wife told me that it's a personal matter and that she has agreed with Beth's request to keep it private and that if Beth wants to tell me about it, she will on her own.  \n\nI told her that I don't really feel comfortable with that kind of plan and that I would like some more information before I agree to it.  At that point, my wife got upset with me and told me that she isn't looking for my approval because she's already told Beth that she can come stay with us.  She reiterated that I need to respect Beth's privacy on this and that she needs me to just trust her on this.  \n\nI told her I do trust her, but that she's asking for a pretty big thing without giving me much information and that I don't feel comfortable going into something like this completely blind.  She said that Beth needs family support and we are the only ones who can give that to her.  (My wife's dad passed away during the pandemic and her mom is already in an assisted living facility).  \n\nShe told me that she needs me to just be caring and kind to Beth and to not bring up anything related to her engagement or wedding unless Beth brings it up to me first.  I told her that I don't appreciate being left in the dark about something that is resulting in another adult living in our house for an open-ended period of time.  \n\nShe told me that she just needs me to trust her and be supportive of her sister.  I kept trying to get more information but my wife eventually snapped at me to just stop asking questions because she's not telling me anything else and I need to just shut up and do this for her and her sister.  \n\nShe did immediately apologize, but told me that she needs me to do this for her because it's important and that she doesn't want to hear one more thing about why Beth is staying with us.  I tried to ask at least how long Beth would be staying, but she cut me off and said \"What the hell did I just say about questions?\"\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
