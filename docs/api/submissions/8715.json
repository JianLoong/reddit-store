My wife has a younger sister, Beth (25F).  Beth and I don't get along very well, but we are cordial and she's a good aunt to our kids.  Beth got engaged to her high school sweetheart last summer and their wedding is scheduled for this coming summer.  \n\nBut last week, my wife came to me and told me that Beth wants to come stay with us for a while.  I immediately started asking questions because Beth lives over 2 hours away from us and usually plans visits out weeks in advance.  My wife told me that it is a personal matter and that I need to respect Beth's privacy in that regard.  I asked my wife how long Beth would be staying and she told me that she doesn't know and that all she will tell me is that the wedding is currently on hold and that Beth needs a place to stay for a bit.  \n\nI said that if I'm going to agree to an open-ended stay from someone who I don't get along with very well, I feel like I have a right to at least know why that person is going to be staying with us.  My wife told me that it's a personal matter and that she has agreed with Beth's request to keep it private and that if Beth wants to tell me about it, she will on her own.  \n\nI told her that I don't really feel comfortable with that kind of plan and that I would like some more information before I agree to it.  At that point, my wife got upset with me and told me that she isn't looking for my approval because she's already told Beth that she can come stay with us.  She reiterated that I need to respect Beth's privacy on this and that she needs me to just trust her on this.  \n\nI told her I do trust her, but that she's asking for a pretty big thing without giving me much information and that I don't feel comfortable going into something like this completely blind.  She said that Beth needs family support and we are the only ones who can give that to her.  (My wife's dad passed away during the pandemic and her mom is already in an assisted living facility).  \n\nShe told me that she needs me to just be caring and kind to Beth and to not bring up anything related to her engagement or wedding unless Beth brings it up to me first.  I told her that I don't appreciate being left in the dark about something that is resulting in another adult living in our house for an open-ended period of time.  \n\nShe told me that she just needs me to trust her and be supportive of her sister.  I kept trying to get more information but my wife eventually snapped at me to just stop asking questions because she's not telling me anything else and I need to just shut up and do this for her and her sister.  \n\nShe did immediately apologize, but told me that she needs me to do this for her because it's important and that she doesn't want to hear one more thing about why Beth is staying with us.  I tried to ask at least how long Beth would be staying, but she cut me off and said \"What the hell did I just say about questions?\"", "created_utc": 1675115776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pfbxv/aita_for_insisting_that_i_know_exactly_why_my_sil/", "score": 1613, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone is acting like it's obvious what is going on, but that doesn't seem to be the case to me at all.

Is SIL afraid of her husband or suffering from domestic violence? Is SIL bringing danger to your own household?\n* Is SIL coping with mental health issues? Is your own family properly equipped to provide the help that she needs while maintaining your own wellbeing?\n\nTo me, \"SIL needs to stay with us, and the reasons are a deep secret\" is not sufficient. Yes there are other plausible explanations such as cheating that are embarrassing that SIL would prefer to keep private.

Beth is having serious problems with her fiance, doesn't know if she wants to go through with the wedding. Beth is in crisis and really needs your wife's support right now. Beth will not be talking to you about what specifically happened and your wife will respect her privacy because you would not be helpful in this matter. They don't know how long because it's a crisis and Beth is feeling so overwhelmed right now that she can't predict how long it will take for her to feel centered and make the decision she needs to make that will affect the rest of her life.

My wife has a younger sister, Beth (25F).  Beth and I don't get along very well, but we are cordial and she's a good aunt to our kids.  Beth got engaged to her high school sweetheart last summer and their wedding is scheduled for this coming summer.  \n\nBut last week, my wife came to me and told me that Beth wants to come stay with us for a while.  I immediately started asking questions because Beth lives over 2 hours away from us and usually plans visits out weeks in advance.  My wife told me that it is a personal matter and that I need to respect Beth's privacy in that regard.  I asked my wife how long Beth would be staying and she told me that she doesn't know and that all she will tell me is that the wedding is currently on hold and that Beth needs a place to stay for a bit.  \n\nI said that if I'm going to agree to an open-ended stay from someone who I don't get along with very well, I feel like I have a right to at least know why that person is going to be staying with us.  My wife told me that it's a personal matter and that she has agreed with Beth's request to keep it private and that if Beth wants to tell me about it, she will on her own.  \n\nI told her that I don't really feel comfortable with that kind of plan and that I would like some more information before I agree to it.  At that point, my wife got upset with me and told me that she isn't looking for my approval because she's already told Beth that she can come stay with us.  She reiterated that I need to respect Beth's privacy on this and that she needs me to just trust her on this.  \n\nI told her I do trust her, but that she's asking for a pretty big thing without giving me much information and that I don't feel comfortable going into something like this completely blind.  She said that Beth needs family support and we are the only ones who can give that to her.  (My wife's dad passed away during the pandemic and her mom is already in an assisted living facility).  \n\nShe told me that she needs me to just be caring and kind to Beth and to not bring up anything related to her engagement or wedding unless Beth brings it up to me first.  I told her that I don't appreciate being left in the dark about something that is resulting in another adult living in our house for an open-ended period of time.  \n\nShe told me that she just needs me to trust her and be supportive of her sister.  I kept trying to get more information but my wife eventually snapped at me to just stop asking questions because she's not telling me anything else and I need to just shut up and do this for her and her sister.  \n\nShe did immediately apologize, but told me that she needs me to do this for her because it's important and that she doesn't want to hear one more thing about why Beth is staying with us.

You won\u2019t need to know what the appointments are for, or who they\u2019re with, just whatever advance notice you\u2019ll need so you can make other arrangements.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s probably just a break-up/fight with no attached baggage other than her feeling sad &/or embarrassed and a desire to get away for a bit.

Maybe this would be a great time for them to bond as sisters! Alone and in their own place of residence\u2026. Seriously, OP. Your wife is awful to you, and you do not deserve to be treated like this, particularly by your spouse. Your SIL would be contributing nothing to the household, could stay indefinitely, will be a source of tension in your marriage, as well as an annoyance, and your wife is as good as telling you that she expects you to treat her sister like gold without consideration for your feelings or treatment. Where is the upside of this? Why are you expected to provide support when no one else has your back? Get a spine, and tell your wife \u201cno\u201d.

Is the sister going to be helping financially to the household or are you expected to foot the bill for the added increase in electricity, food, water, etc. If you rent, are there stipulations about extended guests you need to comply with? Is she bringing pets into the home too? Where is she going to be set up and do you have the space for her or are you going to have to give up space for her? If you own, do you know what your Tennant laws are for your area? In some places if a person has their mail forwarded to a new home and can prove they have lived there for 3 months, they are automatically considered tennants and in order to make them leave, you have to go through the court system and that can take another 30-90 days or more depending. Is she going to become a new babysitter since she is moving in? Has your wife also given her sister the right to make decisions in the home you SHARE with her?

That's what I assume when I ask the same.\n\nBesides all these safety considerations, it would be nice to know how to best support his wife's sister and what topics to stay away from and such.

Especially if the sister disliked the wife. \nThere are too many unknowns to blindly allow an in-law to stay for however long she wants.", "It's not unreasonable, but an answer of \"she's not sure\" is something that also needs to be accepted, possibly with a caveat that after X amount of time there has to be another conversation.", "Or drug use or cheating or theft. Any of that would be a mess I'd want to keep far away from my kids.", "Honestly, if the reason Beth is moving in with them is because the fianc\u00e9 is violent, then yeah, OP very much has a right to know.", "It could just as easily be Beth\u2019s fault as her fianc\u00e9\u2019s as well", "Also, op isn\u2019t just a boyfriend, he\u2019s her husband and is the parent to his kids too. He needs to know", "If your wife is being this obstinate, can you take the kids and go stay somewhere else until it's over? I would insist on knowing reasons too. I would press for reasons until sister and wife got so annoyed THEY left!!! You need to know that your kids are safe.", "Absolutely, that\u2019s one of the very reasonable questions. Not asking for specifics", "Have you asked your wife if there are safety concerns?", "Me either. NTA.", "Same.", "That was my thought too!  I could see respecting SIL's privacy when it comes to the nitty gritty details, but the wife should be able to provide a general explanation as to what is going on.  It really seems like she knows the husband would not be okay with the real reason and is going for the idea that \"getting forgiveness is easier then getting permission\"...", "Yep. Like she is going into rehab (or needs to), etc\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem something \u201cbenign\u201d like a routine breakup, which just puts up red flags for domestic violence and/or drugs/alcohol. \n\nUnless the wife enjoys treating her husband like a mushroom, which is a different issue", "I was thinking drugs, alcohol, gambling problem, etc. Something that Bath wouldn't want people to know about. Or maybe something the wife is ashamed of.", "Like SIL cheated and fiance is kicking her out of the house..", "Or she cheated and got kicked out", "Or... \none of them cheated, sister or fiance, and one of them is really embarrassed and doesn't want anyone else, besides OPs wife, of course\n\nThe possibilities are limitless here, though.", "I don\u2019t know i feel like If it was an abuse/safety concern like the top two are saying than it would be known because it would have to be for safety.\n\nI\u2019m thinking it\u2019s something deeply personal about the sister that ops wife doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s her place to share.\n\nHonestly where my brain went is the sister realized she was gay. \nYes I know it\u2019s a total reach but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s not people who don\u2019t realize these things till later in life or don\u2019t accept them/think they can fix it by just going through the motions till it clicks.\n\nI know it\u2019s a stretch but it\u2019s the only explanation I can think of that would make the wife\u2019s behavior make sense.\n\nIf she just realized she wasn\u2019t in love with the guy than wife wouldn\u2019t have a problem sharing. If it was an abuse thing she\u2019d have to because hubby has to know this man is not safe to let in. If sis was cheating I could kinda see it but I don\u2019t think the wife would be so vehemently opposed to explaining.\n\nBut if someone comes out to you and is scared and asks you not to tell anyone than o can understand the fortress type block on info.\n\nThat\u2019s my guess anyways.\n\nI get why op feels he needs to know but if he trusts his wife and trusts her judgement than I feel like he should give the benefit of the doubt  at least for a bit.", "Absolutely, if you're moving in with a couple you should expect that all adults involved will have a general understanding of what is going on. Which is why, if I had to guess, the SIL cheated on her fiance. Because if the situation was at all sympathetic it could be easily summarized.", "You can keep all your secrets under your own roof, but you want to live under mine I need a bit more than the broad strokes.", "basically every couple I know, shares stuff like this openly between them. You tell one something, the other knows.  I am not like that but if he asks I'm giving him an overview.  I don't get that OP is concerned about his safety, I'm getting that he's being vengeful in a way. But personally I want to know what you are bringing into this house, unwittingly or not. And if it's going to put my kids in danger, it's not happening, sister or no.  There are ways of helping people that don't involve letting them move in with you.", "So true.", "Yep, his wife is being completely unreasonable in multiple ways.", "If they lived separately for sure. But he lives in the same house as his wife. As their kids. He's not saying no, as he knows it's important to his wife. But he does have a say in what happens in his house. What he's asking for is information beyond \"This is happening, you get no say and no details on it\". She wouldn't even give him a general time frame. \n\nThe relationship between OP and SIL is not so bad he just outright refuses to let her stay. He doesn't even say not without discussion. He just wants to know why he is going to have someone else living with him, and how long? How does that not make OP's wife an asshole?\n\nNow let's just go with worst case scenario: DV. SIL's partner is now a threat to OP's wife and kids (not to mention SIL). It's not a reason to turn SIL away, but if the partner shows up at OP's door to 'talk', then you want to have that knowledge to just straight up nope them away. \n\nOP and wife are a team here. SIL has to respect that, wife has to respect that, OP has to respect that. So far the only one who does is OP. So how can wife not be an asshole here? Clearly NTA.", "Did you miss the part where the wife told the sister it was okay before ever mentioning it to the husband? How she \u201cwasn\u2019t looking for his approval\u201d", "You do if there\u2019s a chance the fianc\u00e9 could show up at OP\u2019s house and threaten his wife and children.  I mean the wife can make the decision to risk it herself but she doesn\u2019t get to unilaterally make the decision for their children.", "Yeah precisely, then he has a potentially violent person in his house", "Right, at one point she says that she already told SIL she could stay there. Before even talking to the husband. That is not ok.", "That and she's possibly pregnant", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m leaning in this direction too. I bet OPs wife knows he would not be happy housing a cheater\u2026who he doesn\u2019t really get along with in the first place. Also OPs wife probably doesn\u2019t want to hear anything negative said about her precious sister.  Why else would SIL be the one moving and it be such a secret?", "Your friends cannot count on your confidence for anything?  Why does your boyfriend need to know everything going on in your friend/ family lives?", "Ew. I'm sorry you have to deal with that.", "Yup. Essentially another child to take care of.", "But she is the one going into his home too", "But then she doesn't get to ask him to provide a roof over her head.", "Then she doesn't need to be in his home.", "Then she can find her own place to live. I also want to point out that OP's wife has not even mentored who is going to be paying all of Beth's bills.", ">Beth might not feel comfortable having her worst moment broadcast to a man who doesn\u2019t like her very much though\n\nThat's completely fair... BUT it's not fair to also expect that person to house you indefinitely with no questions asked lol", "If someone was moving into my house I have every right to know why. It would absolutely affect my decision of whether or not they can live in my house.", "He's not making it about him. He has a right to know. And it's weird how his wife refuses to say anything about the reason for the stay, as if there's something to hide.", "Yeah and he doesn\u2019t know if that \u201crelationship drama\u201d involves an abusive fianc\u00e9 showing up to see Beth. He doesn\u2019t know\n\nIf another adult is going to stay in your house, it\u2019s \u201cfishing\u201d and \u201cbeing nosy\u201d to ask your wife for clarification when she blows up at you for even asking About when she might be out?", "Her fiance could be a dangerous dude. If I had kids I'd want to know if I should be keeping extra vigilance out for some maniac that might barge into my home.", "I mean, \"wedding is on hold\" can have numerous reasons ranging from cheating to \"oh, turns out the fianc\u00e9 is actually violent\". Given the fact that Beth is going to be living with them for an undecided amount of time I do think it's reasonable that OP gets to know the reason in advance.", "I sort of get it, I would give a much more consideration to someone who had been cheated on them the cheater. I would need to know if this is something they might be able to work out or was relationship ending because it directly impacts how long the Sister may be staying. It\u2019s not to know the details so much as to predict how things might go. OP NTA", "Right. OP doesn't need to know everything but he needs to know:\n\na) Will there be any danger to his family, either from Beth or from her fiance?\n\nb) What is the end date/exit plan?\n\nc) How much information is a secret vs how much is open? Would it be dangerous for him to share that she is there?\n\nd) What topics of conversation should he avoid to be respectful to her?", "He was literally told he cannot ask any more questions. When he tried, his wife blew up. And if he needs to make sure the kids are safe, if his wife was responsible she would be up front about that. Why should he have to craft the perfect question to be told if his *children will be safe*?\n\nAnd if he hit or assaulted her he especially needs to know. Abusive partners are dangerous and show up to stalk their partners all the time", "She said no more questions. What part of that was confusing to you? \u201cAre we in danger?\u201d is certainly not going to be met with honesty and calm when she\u2019s already pissed that he\u2019s questioning her at all. How do you think it will go if he questions whether she\u2019s endangering her children?", "Wife is clearly not going to be forthcoming, and as a partner and father of her children that she\u2019s expecting to welcome her sister for an open-ended amount of time, yes, he\u2019s owed the nitty-gritty.", "She said no more questions. That\u2019s what she said.", "How do you treat someone as a mushroom? You smoke them or cook them in an omelette?", "Most likely scenario is sexual assault, I reckon. That's the one 'secret' I might keep from my husband, if the woman asked me to.", "I was thinking cheating, possibly by the SIL, and they got caught. That would be a good reason for the wedding to be \"on hold\" or called off with her needing to be out of the area for awhile.", "Oh shit. I didn't consider that.\n\nIts still an asshole move but trying to keep SIL's fuck up a secret, whether its cheating or something else, is the most \"understandable\" reason for the emphasis on the secrecy. OP's wife might be trying to save her sister's reputation here or at least keeping it from OP because she knows he would never agree to helping her if she did something really bad and is in this situation completely by her fault.", "Someone else suggested that the sister cheated and if its the most \"understandable\" reason for his wife's actions. Its still an asshole move but the wife's motivation might be \"protecting her sister\" even if she's in this situation because she fucked up bad. It might not be cheating, but of she did something bad, its likely that the wife knows OP would never accept helping someone he already has a tough time getting a long with and supporting her and sacrificing to minimize the consequences of her actions when she fucked up and its all her fault.", "If that's the case, depending on what state she's in, she might be needing to come to OP's house/state to terminate it....", "From the affair partner?", "which would make it 10x worse, cos I'm sure the responsibility to provide would fall on OP. A responsibility he was not made aware of, didn't ask for, & wasn't even allowed to veto.", "My friends don't care because they are the same way. If I tell them something, I fully expect them to tell their partners. He doesn't need to know, I just have no intention of keeping secrets from him. Different people have different opinions, but that's my prerogative, and all my friends know and accept that.", "She's going to her sisters home, the only close family she seems to have. I can't imagine I would want a person who dislikes me to know the private details of my life. I understand him wanting to have a time frame, 1 weeks, 2 months. But what does he think his wife is going to say that will change the fact her sister needs to stay with them?", "Feed 'em shit and keep 'em in the dark.", "This feels like the only valid reason for the code of silence.", "Wait...what, as a non American is this really a thing?", "Maybe she cheated on him, maybe the BF is a violent abuser who is going to stalk OP's house. There's a spectrum between \"private details\" and any explanation at all.", "Yeah, that\u2019s the line I was referring to", "Oh yes. Now there are some states who are attempting to prevent women from going to other states for termination. It\u2019s illegal, but they\u2019re still trying. If SIL needs an abortion it should absolutely be kept quiet. Not from OP though. He has every right to know what is coming to his house regardless of circumstances.", "Yep. Even before Roe V Wade was overturned, a lot of women had to travel to a different city/state to even find a clinic that would perform an abortion. Some states didn\u2019t have enough providers near them or they were constantly harassed with protestors. \n\nOr if a woman didn\u2019t want her partner/family to know, she would go out of town for her safety in case they tried to change her mind or physically stop her from getting an abortion.", "Sadly, yes.  The real kicker is that these states are doing nothing to create programs to then help these women forced to give birth.", "You deserve all the karma, friend.", "I have never heard that before and love it so much! Nice one guys", "Are you tired from that huge leap you just made? He hasn\u2019t said he doesn\u2019t trust his wife he said he\u2019s worried that she isn\u2019t seeing the bigger picture as her focus is solely on her sister in this situation and she maybe hasn\u2019t thought about if there will be a safety issue for their children.", "The shorthand for it, as u/Belaerim deftly used it, is to, \"treat 'em like a mushroom,\" and let the second part go unspoken.", "Dude said he doesn't believe his wife will prioritize her own kids safety at home over her sister, that sounds to me like he doesn't trust her judgement. As others on this post have pointed out, most people in healthy relationships trust their partners to not allow potentially dangerous people/situations around their children.", "All of this is predicated around a false premise that people don\u2019t ignore danger when helping those they love and that spouses don\u2019t betray each other\u2019s trust all the time.\n\nIf everyone who doesn\u2019t trust their spouse needs therapy then I guess all spouses are perfect"]}
