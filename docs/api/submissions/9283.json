But once the damn thing was out of its puppy phase they lost most interest.  \n\nSo for about two years now I have been walking it because it needs exercise.  I have to buy it food because my wife forgets.  I have to walk around the back yard before I mow to make sure I'm not going to run over it's turds.  \n\nI'm done.  I came home yesterday and it had chewed up a pair of my shoes.   \n\nI waited until dinner and then I laid down the law.   Thay poor thing is going stir crazy.   It is used to getting their attention and stuff all the time because of COVID.  Now that they can do other stuff they are ignoring it.  It isn't fair to the dog and it isn't fair to me.  \n\nI said that if they didn't have time to walk it they could play with it in the back yard.  But that if I found any turds back there that I was hiring a service to keep the yard clean but the money was coming out of their allowances or the house budget.  I said I wasn't buying any more food.  If there was no food and the dog wasn't fed I would be hiring someone to watch the dog and once again they would be paying for it.  \n\nThey got upset with me because the dog likes me and it's obviously my dog.  Of course the thing likes me, I take care of it, which I don't want to do.  \n\nSo I brought out our agreement which I made them all sign.  Not my responsibility.  I said they had three choices.  Take care of the dog, rehome the dog, or pay someone else to take care of the dog.  \n\nThey all think I'm being too harsh but I don't think so. I didn't want it on the first place. I've already checked with a friend of mine. She likes dogs and has agreed to take it if my family cannot follow through.  \n\nMy wife says that I'm being an asshole with this ultimatum.

It's great for your wife to frame this as some dramatic \"ultimatum\" because that sounds like you've done something wrong. \n\nInstead, what this really is, is a bunch of people who are happy to have a dog so long as they have no responsibility. Do they really \"love\" the dog if when asked to care for it or lose it they simply get upset with you? It would have been so easy for your wife to step in and say \"we are keeping the dog, so let's come up with a schedule to walk the dog, alternate weekly cleaning up the background, and I'll buy the food.\" \n\nSee how easy that was? Well the only thing easier is to complain without action, which is what your family is trying to do here.

It's not going to stop following you around worshipping you if the wife and kids step up their dog care game. Given this dynamic, and that currently the animal is being neglected by the test if the family and unloved by you,  may I suggest you take the dog to the vet's, and talk to them to see if any of their other clients are dog lovers who are familiar with that breed, and ask for help mindfully rehoming him/her into a family who will be able to love and care for the dog properly.\n\nIf it's got any border collie and/or labrador retriever genes, and you're near Philadelphia, pm me.", "NTA and they need to do better.

They get to keep the dog and continue neglecting it.\n\nSeriously, there's a huge trope about the pet-hating dad/grandpa who ends up being the primary human for that pet.  I bet your family was counting on you falling in love with the dog and being its human.  Well, they got half their wish - you have become its human, because you are its primary caretaker.\n\nThat's not fair to you and, honestly, not fair to doggo.

A dog is a serious years long commitment, not just something you play with till you\u2019re bored and then move on.\n\nMy partner and I have been together 10 years. She had a puppy before we got together, Shani. That dog loves her and adores her. However, when she got sick a few years ago and I had to start being the sole care giver to the dog the dog started gravitating toward me. She got upset about it, but I had to remind her that caring for an animal leads to a stronger bond. The dog wasn\u2019t upset with her, she just no longer associated my partner with bonding activities like walks, baths, and play time. \n\nYou get what you put into the relationship with dogs.

You came up with 3 options and a choice for them.  Though I worry for you that your wife is squirming out of this and trying to put responsibilities on you that the kids agreed to.  That is a major major problem that you and your wife are not in sync on this.\n\nI would say this is something you need to get in sync with your wife about privately, and then take to the kids.  Needs to be a united front.  The fact they \"got upset with me because the dog likes me and it's obviously my dog.\" shows they are all trying to manipulate you.  Want to get through to them.

I was in the exact same spot as you and SO called my bluff (getting rid of the dog, which I couldn\u2019t do knowing it would as an older dog most likely get put down.  I interviewed people who do it at shelters and it is not what the general populace hears, that they just go to sleep).  I took care of the dog and scooped poo until she was so old we had her put down at home.  I said no more pets and mean it.  Maybe when I\u2019m old and don\u2019t like to travel, but not until then.

We got a dog last summer after some discussion and one of the reasons I (mom) had always said no was that I didn't want to take the time to do the work. I had other things going on and I knew dogs were work, any pet is. \n\nWe did decide to get a dog for a few reasons, and guess who is the dog's favorite?

The dog is barely being taken care of as it is, and the three people who promised they would care for it just fucked off and left it in the care of a resentful owner who was essentially lied to. So what if it ends up on a Craigslist listing for a new owner?\n\nWhy should the dog be forced to remain in a house where its bring neglected just because of the POSSIBILITY that it MIGHT end up in a bad [worse] home? You take that risk with any owner and any animal. There was no guarantee that this family wasn't abusive either but now the dog has to stay?", "He already has a home lined up for the dog.", "I would apologize for accidentally not reading that part of the post, but because so many people replied with exactly the same thing without reading the other replies, I'm gonna downgrade it to an oops.", "That literally means the exact same thing. So if there is no food to feed the dog they are hiring someone to do it out of the wife\u2019s funds and the kids allowances he mentioned earlier lol.", "There are two kinds of grammar: descriptive and proscriptive.\n\nDescriptive grammar is usually used by linguists to describe how various languages work.\n\nProscriptive grammar is the kind you learn in school, where \"it\" is the pronoun used to refer to things as well as animals.\n\nEither way, neither \"it\" or \"he/she\" is \"wrong\" for a dog, since even the proscriptive grammar taught in school is largely arbitrary.", "I disagree, because somewhere in that 1.5-2 year timeframe, OP began walking the dog, feeding, and generally taking care of him.  If OP started doing these things without reminding his family of their initial promises, it is reasonable for them to assume that he WANTED to, because as they thought, it was now HIS DOG. \n\nI'm saying NAH because he did not make it clear to them THEN or SINCE, until now, that this was not acceptable to him.  OP is part of his own problem here.", "You are awfully fast to jump to conclusions. I\u2019m not upset about anything I\u2019m nearly made an observation. And you don\u2019t have to like it.", "It's so fucking wild that people would rather have an animal be forced to stay in a home where its neglected and resented because of some stupid \"PeTs aRe ForEveR\"/\"bUt wE WeRe HErE FiRsT\" mindset, rather than have an animal experience temporary discomfort and confusion and then have a lifetime of, you know, LOVE AND CARE.\n\nIt's all people anthropomorphizing pets and projecting human psychological reactions onto an animal. \"Well foster kids are scarred from being moved around a lot of foster homes so if a dog goes from one home to one more home then it'll be tRaUmaTiZeD\"", "Dog sitters don't supply their own dog food; even doggy day cares, you have to supply the food so if the dog has no food & OP refuses to buy the food, how is the dog going to get fed?", "Hell no, OP made it perfectly clear beforehand that they needed to take care of the dog. He started doing it because THEY neglected to do it. Should OP of said something beforehand? Sure, but they are still AH\u2019s for neglecting the dog to the point where OP had to start taking care of it.", "lol you didn't even read the freaking post and you're judging it", "It IS traumatizing to be rehomed, or moved between different families. \n\nIt is however ALSO severely traumatizing to be neglected, and forcing a living being to suffer that neglect purely to keep them around is much worse than taking that pain and finding them a home where they can be much happier and healthier. It is unfortunate, but sometimes we must make the hard decision to take a risk for things to get better when the other option is to silently and safely suffer.", "Ok walnut this is my last comment to you but I\u2019m about to blow your mind. There are dog sitters that you can hire to just come by and use all your own stuff- these are jobs that can be done by teenage neighbors and the like. But there are also actual pet services that will literally do whatever you pay them for including bringing food (they don\u2019t \u201cprovide\u201d the food even then but you can pay someone to get the food you pay for lol).", "Nobody said the sitters should provide their own dog food. You can also ask the sitter to bring food and pay them accordingly with the kids allowances etc. The point is that op will not be the one to go to the stores to buy food and feed it. But he clearly would make sure that the dog gets fed by someone else which the kids and wife would have to pay for", "Agree to disagree.\n\nOP became complicit in their failure the minute he started taking care of the dog.  HE was not following the terms of the contract they all signed.\n\nIt was also not on him to remind or cajole or punish any of them for not doing what they agreed to do.  The consequences of their inaction should have been spelled out as well.\n\nIt's not clear if the current 3 options were already spelled out in the original contract, but as long as any one of them was, he is OK to offer them alternatives.", "It's Reddit, don't expect everyone to be rational.  You're NTA by the way."]}
