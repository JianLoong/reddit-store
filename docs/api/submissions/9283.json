But once the damn thing was out of its puppy phase they lost most interest.  \n\nSo for about two years now I have been walking it because it needs exercise.  I have to buy it food because my wife forgets.  I have to walk around the back yard before I mow to make sure I'm not going to run over it's turds.  \n\nI'm done.  I came home yesterday and it had chewed up a pair of my shoes.   \n\nI waited until dinner and then I laid down the law.   Thay poor thing is going stir crazy.   It is used to getting their attention and stuff all the time because of COVID.  Now that they can do other stuff they are ignoring it.  It isn't fair to the dog and it isn't fair to me.  \n\nI said that if they didn't have time to walk it they could play with it in the back yard.  But that if I found any turds back there that I was hiring a service to keep the yard clean but the money was coming out of their allowances or the house budget.  I said I wasn't buying any more food.  If there was no food and the dog wasn't fed I would be hiring someone to watch the dog and once again they would be paying for it.  \n\nThey got upset with me because the dog likes me and it's obviously my dog.  Of course the thing likes me, I take care of it, which I don't want to do.  \n\nSo I brought out our agreement which I made them all sign.  Not my responsibility.  I said they had three choices.  Take care of the dog, rehome the dog, or pay someone else to take care of the dog.  \n\nThey all think I'm being too harsh but I don't think so. I didn't want it on the first place. I've already checked with a friend of mine. She likes dogs and has agreed to take it if my family cannot follow through.  \n\nMy wife says that I'm being an asshole with this ultimatum.

It's great for your wife to frame this as some dramatic \"ultimatum\" because that sounds like you've done something wrong. \n\nInstead, what this really is, is a bunch of people who are happy to have a dog so long as they have no responsibility. Do they really \"love\" the dog if when asked to care for it or lose it they simply get upset with you? It would have been so easy for your wife to step in and say \"we are keeping the dog, so let's come up with a schedule to walk the dog, alternate weekly cleaning up the background, and I'll buy the food.\" \n\nSee how easy that was? Well the only thing easier is to complain without action, which is what your family is trying to do here.

Not just because you've been walking it and feeding it lately, dogs pick Their Person, and basically love that person devotedly. It's very hard for the dog to switch away from that imprint. It's not going to stop following you around worshipping you if the wife and kids step up their dog care game. Given this dynamic, and that currently the animal is being neglected by the test if the family and unloved by you,  may I suggest you take the dog to the vet's, and talk to them to see if any of their other clients are dog lovers who are familiar with that breed, and ask for help mindfully rehoming him/her into a family who will be able to love and care for the dog properly.\n\nIf it's got any border collie and/or labrador retriever genes, and you're near Philadelphia, pm me.", "NTA and they need to do better.

They get to keep the dog and continue neglecting it.\n\nSeriously, there's a huge trope about the pet-hating dad/grandpa who ends up being the primary human for that pet.  I bet your family was counting on you falling in love with the dog and being its human.  Well, they got half their wish - you have become its human, because you are its primary caretaker.\n\nThat's not fair to you and, honestly, not fair to doggo.  I think your options are very very fair.", "NTA but your wife definitely is", "NTA if it was just your kids who wanted the dog then maybe you would\u2019ve been TA just cause kids always ask for things and usually don\u2019t follow through.

I rehomed my son\u2019s snake yesterday because he kept repeatedly letting it run out of water.", "NTA.. they need to take responsibility!", "NTA. This is exactly why you had them sign the agreement. A dog is a serious years long commitment, not just something you play with till you\u2019re bored and then move on.\n\nMy partner and I have been together 10 years. She had a puppy before we got together, Shani. That dog loves her and adores her. However, when she got sick a few years ago and I had to start being the sole care giver to the dog the dog started gravitating toward me. She got upset about it, but I had to remind her that caring for an animal leads to a stronger bond. The dog wasn\u2019t upset with her, she just no longer associated my partner with bonding activities like walks, baths, and play time. \n\nYou get what you put into the relationship with dogs.

You came up with 3 options and a choice for them.  Though I worry for you that your wife is squirming out of this and trying to put responsibilities on you that the kids agreed to.  That is a major major problem that you and your wife are not in sync on this.\n\nI would say this is something you need to get in sync with your wife about privately, and then take to the kids.  Needs to be a united front.  The fact they \"got upset with me because the dog likes me and it's obviously my dog.\" shows they are all trying to manipulate you.  Want to get through to them.

I was in the exact same spot as you and SO called my bluff (getting rid of the dog, which I couldn\u2019t do knowing it would as an older dog most likely get put down.  I interviewed people who do it at shelters and it is not what the general populace hears, that they just go to sleep).  I took care of the dog and scooped poo until she was so old we had her put down at home.  I said no more pets and mean it.  Maybe when I\u2019m old and don\u2019t like to travel, but not until then.

We got a dog last summer after some discussion and one of the reasons I (mom) had always said no was that I didn't want to take the time to do the work. I had other things going on and I knew dogs were work, any pet is. \n\nWe did decide to get a dog for a few reasons, and guess who is the dog's favorite? I am because I feed her in the mornings and usually take her out twice a day for walks, plus intermittent pets. She's an older dog that we got from a rescue, so it's not the work a puppy would be, but still, it's work. I don't mind because I knew it would be like this, but it still gets me sometimes.\n\nThey are reneging on the agreement and there are consequences for that.\n\nAs Sia says, puppies are forever, not just for Christmas.", "If your wife is home all day, what is her excuse for not taking care of the dog?", "[deleted]", "Don\u2019t listen to this guy. You\u2019re absolutely in the right.", "The dog has been cared for by OP.  They aren't AH to the dog if the dog's needs have been met.  They weren't AH to OP up to now, if they were assuming he liked doing things for \"his\" dog.\n\nIn particular, a child isn't an AH for not taking care of a pet that they've never been required to take care of.\n\nNow that he has set the record straight, they all need to step up or they are the AH.", "[deleted]", "Nope, that sucks.  Sounds like everyone is the AH in your house.   You 100% should not have agreed to a dog.  That is on you and why you are the AH.  Your family are AH because they have walked away from a living family member.   Dogs aren't toys.  They are pack animals .   It's probably best for the dog to try and re-home it, but that doesn't absolve your participation in this.", "Sure he is.   It's not a plastic toy to be thrown away.", "I didn't say he was the only AH did I?  He still agreed to it, he is also responsible", "I would bet money that statement was some sort of error.\n\nWho says a dog is very fine people and in the next breath calls it the thing. I call bullshit.", "I didn\u2019t ask you to. I don\u2019t like dogs either, as a day to day rule. But they aren\u2019t \u2018things\u2019 and Your comment was just unnecessary.", "I was a dog walker for a few years, it blew my mind how many families I would walk for who had kids/teens who were perfectly capable of taking care of their dogs, that\u2019s an easy chore to teach them some responsibility. I was happy for the work but really couldn\u2019t believe how much some people spent for me to take care of their dogs.", "Why are you just completely ignoring the giant fact that the wife was also in this equation? NTA. The wife wore him down along with the children. She\u2019s a grown adult too even if she isn\u2019t acting like it.", "I was gonna say NTA but you've changed my mind.", "When I'm not out of town I see with my own eyes that the dog goes days without being walked if I do not walk it. Does that count as evidence?", "You sound delusional.", "I was assured by three teens and an adult that they would be responsible.", "So OP did say no. But 3 other people said they wanted it so they got a dog. Those three people now ignore the dog. OP, the only person acknowledging that the dog is a living being, suggested they take care of the dog, pay someone to take care of the dog, or rehome it. All fair to the dog.\n\nOP isn't suggesting the pound or putting the dog down. OP is the only own treating the dog as if it matters.", "So he is an AH for believing his wife at her word?", "> Sounds like everyone is the AH in your house.\n\nShould've been E.S.H instead of Y.T.A then, no? :P", "His \"participation in this\" being taking care of the dog so it won't be neglected...? Rehoming the dog it's exactly the final solution OP proposed? Making them agree to treat it with the respect a living being deserves was his first step at addressing the issue? \n\nYou didn't even read the whole post, by your own admission, you just want to be angry at OP.", "Did you not read the post. He has someone willing to take the dog in he not even putting it in a pound. He give them options and two of them let them keep the dog but he's not taking care of it anymore.", "You might want to go with ESH as your judgement, because YTA is usually read as \"OP is the asshole and not anyone else\" while ESH covers multiple people being assholes.", "What do you want me to say?  I don't like dogs. Some on tv seem pretty cool.  Ok I liked the littlest hobo when I was a kid.", "Everything is a thing. It really wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. Some people are triggered by the most trivial things", "STFU", "If you don't like the answer, don't ask the question.   As I said, they ATA as well.", "I didn't not read that.  That is the best solution for the dog.   Still AH IMO.", "Someone else here said I was an asshole for setting an ultimatum on my family but now you are saying I'm an asshole for not vetoing the dog.  I'm not arguing.  It's just weird.", "But how? He literally did everything right.", "OP\u2019s deal was he didn\u2019t have to take care of the dog.  The rest of the family committed to it.  They aren\u2019t holding up to their commitment.  They have a choice to pay to have it done, or give the dog to the friend.  If OP didn\u2019t step in, the dog would not be cared for.  There are AHs here, but not OP,", "'Doesn't read the full post and proceeds to get angry.' You're a moron.", "Maybe you and I value life differently.  It's not a toy.  It's a living creature that only knows this family.  They have, as a family, took on a responsibility and are all walking away from it.    Dogs are for life IMO.   Not a dog person, don't get a dog.  It's pretty fucking simple.", "Maybe you should learn to read first."]}
