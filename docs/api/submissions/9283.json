But once the damn thing was out of its puppy phase they lost most interest.  \n\nSo for about two years now I have been walking it because it needs exercise.  I have to buy it food because my wife forgets.  I have to walk around the back yard before I mow to make sure I'm not going to run over it's turds.  \n\nI'm done.  I came home yesterday and it had chewed up a pair of my shoes.   \n\nI waited until dinner and then I laid down the law.   Thay poor thing is going stir crazy.   It is used to getting their attention and stuff all the time because of COVID.  Now that they can do other stuff they are ignoring it.  It isn't fair to the dog and it isn't fair to me.  \n\nI said that if they didn't have time to walk it they could play with it in the back yard.  But that if I found any turds back there that I was hiring a service to keep the yard clean but the money was coming out of their allowances or the house budget.  I said I wasn't buying any more food.  If there was no food and the dog wasn't fed I would be hiring someone to watch the dog and once again they would be paying for it.  \n\nThey got upset with me because the dog likes me and it's obviously my dog.  Of course the thing likes me, I take care of it, which I don't want to do.  \n\nSo I brought out our agreement which I made them all sign.  Not my responsibility.  I said they had three choices.  Take care of the dog, rehome the dog, or pay someone else to take care of the dog.  \n\nThey all think I'm being too harsh but I don't think so. I didn't want it on the first place. I've already checked with a friend of mine. She likes dogs and has agreed to take it if my family cannot follow through.  \n\nMy wife says that I'm being an asshole with this ultimatum.

It's great for your wife to frame this as some dramatic \"ultimatum\" because that sounds like you've done something wrong. \n\nInstead, what this really is, is a bunch of people who are happy to have a dog so long as they have no responsibility. Do they really \"love\" the dog if when asked to care for it or lose it they simply get upset with you? It would have been so easy for your wife to step in and say \"we are keeping the dog, so let's come up with a schedule to walk the dog, alternate weekly cleaning up the background, and I'll buy the food.\" \n\nSee how easy that was? Well the only thing easier is to complain without action, which is what your family is trying to do here.

It's not going to stop following you around worshipping you if the wife and kids step up their dog care game. Given this dynamic, and that currently the animal is being neglected by the test if the family and unloved by you,  may I suggest you take the dog to the vet's, and talk to them to see if any of their other clients are dog lovers who are familiar with that breed, and ask for help mindfully rehoming him/her into a family who will be able to love and care for the dog properly.\n\nIf it's got any border collie and/or labrador retriever genes, and you're near Philadelphia, pm me.", "NTA and they need to do better.

They get to keep the dog and continue neglecting it.\n\nSeriously, there's a huge trope about the pet-hating dad/grandpa who ends up being the primary human for that pet.  I bet your family was counting on you falling in love with the dog and being its human.  Well, they got half their wish - you have become its human, because you are its primary caretaker.\n\nThat's not fair to you and, honestly, not fair to doggo.  I think your options are very very fair.", "NTA but your wife definitely is", "NTA if it was just your kids who wanted the dog then maybe you would\u2019ve been TA just cause kids always ask for things and usually don\u2019t follow through.

I rehomed my son\u2019s snake yesterday because he kept repeatedly letting it run out of water.", "NTA.. they need to take responsibility!", "NTA. This is exactly why you had them sign the agreement. A dog is a serious years long commitment, not just something you play with till you\u2019re bored and then move on.\n\nMy partner and I have been together 10 years. She had a puppy before we got together, Shani. That dog loves her and adores her. However, when she got sick a few years ago and I had to start being the sole care giver to the dog the dog started gravitating toward me. She got upset about it, but I had to remind her that caring for an animal leads to a stronger bond. The dog wasn\u2019t upset with her, she just no longer associated my partner with bonding activities like walks, baths, and play time. \n\nYou get what you put into the relationship with dogs.

You came up with 3 options and a choice for them.  Though I worry for you that your wife is squirming out of this and trying to put responsibilities on you that the kids agreed to.  That is a major major problem that you and your wife are not in sync on this.\n\nI would say this is something you need to get in sync with your wife about privately, and then take to the kids.  Needs to be a united front.  The fact they \"got upset with me because the dog likes me and it's obviously my dog.\" shows they are all trying to manipulate you.  Want to get through to them.

I was in the exact same spot as you and SO called my bluff (getting rid of the dog, which I couldn\u2019t do knowing it would as an older dog most likely get put down.  I interviewed people who do it at shelters and it is not what the general populace hears, that they just go to sleep).  I took care of the dog and scooped poo until she was so old we had her put down at home.  I said no more pets and mean it.  Maybe when I\u2019m old and don\u2019t like to travel, but not until then.

We got a dog last summer after some discussion and one of the reasons I (mom) had always said no was that I didn't want to take the time to do the work. I had other things going on and I knew dogs were work, any pet is. \n\nWe did decide to get a dog for a few reasons, and guess who is the dog's favorite?

The only thing my husband did was pick up poop in back yard before he mowed.", "NTA - if your wife and kids no longer care about this poor dog the best would indeed be to rehome him in a loving home.", "NTA.\nThis is why we have no pets, I love animals, I care for them, I would love to be that person that rehomes a cat but right now. With 4 kids. I have plenty on my plate. I woudnt even agree to them taking care of a pet because we all well damn know who will end up taking care of it.", "NTA. In fact, with the amount of pushback you got at the ultimatum, I\u2019d go ahead and rehome to your friend. Dog deserves much better, and your family won\u2019t shape up, so why delay getting Dog into a better home for them?", "definitely NTA. people dont realize how big of a commitment pets are. the fact is *most* pet owners are shitty pet owners. i wish everybody would stand up for the poor little guys like you're attempting to do", "Asking her to take care of the thing she pushed you to get is too harsh? Uhh no. That\u2019s called being an adult. NTA.", "NTA", "You're NTA, Charles Grodin in Beethoven", "NTA completely fair and you\u2019ve been more than understanding for two years.", "NTA. Typical of the kids, especially depending on age. Very AH of your wife. \n\nYour ultimatums are perfectly reasonable. They should feel bad about rehoming.", "NTA as long as your wife signed the agreement too. If this was just between you and your kids, it\u2019s your own fault and you would be the asshole. But since there is another adult who agreed to your conditions it\u2019s fair to hold them accountable.", "NTA- \u201cThey got upset with me because the dog likes me and it\u2019s obviously my dog. Of course the thing likes me, I take care of it, which I don\u2019t want to.\u201d Made me chuckle but feel sorry for the poor dog. They wanted the dog, they said you wouldn\u2019t have to take care of the dog, your taking care of the dog, no they tell you the dog likes you and it\u2019s your dog? Ridiculous. I hope you follow through with the requirements.", "> . I am not a dog person. They seem like very fine people but they are just not for me.\n\nLOL. This made me laugh. But NTA.", "NTA but this is why the decision to get a pet *must* be unanimous, especially among the adults in a household.", "NTA The typical \"the lost interest because it no longer a puppy\". Also you are not the one that suppose to clean all the waste.", "NTA. You were very clear and even got it in writing. It's better for the dog to go somewhere where people want it. Where it will be loved and cared for. Personally you'd have to pry my German Shepherd from my cold dead hands, but I love him so. On a side note, for the readers, research your breed type before getting pure breed dogs. G.S. and Belgium M's, for example, are work dogs. You have to keep them very active and they have to have a purpose. If not, they will start to develop behavior issues. Mix breeds are awesome as well. My first 2 dogs were mixed. Extremely intelligent.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even think about it. Your friend will give that dog a good home and all the attention it needs.\n\nYour wife and kids obviously lost interests in their \u201ccuddly toy\u201d. I bet if you give it away, they\u2019ll protest and cry for a couple days before they even forget they ever had a dog.", "NTA. Give it to the family that wants it. It will be happier there.", "I am the fur parent to 3 psychotic furry demons with very sharp murder mittens, even though they are technically the kids pets. However, I have had to rehome a couple of dogs because I started working in the office for 8-10 hours a day and did not have the time or energy to take care of them as they should be (Husky and German Shepard - if you know dogs, these are insanely active breeds that require daily exercise and mental stimulation for long periods of time, not be cooped up inside all day by themselves). I was lucky enough to have neighbors who could provide for the doggos and be wonderful fur parents to them, but it was a hard decision to give them up when I raised them and watched them grow from insane, cute puppy to crazy, lovable doggos. Don\u2019t think my kid ever forgave me for it, but I have promised she can get a new dog when she is ready to be 1000% completely responsible for taking care of one. Since she doesn\u2019t want to spend her allowance on a pet, or go on early morning 5am bathroom walks, and she refuses to pick up bathroom droppings, we\u2019ve yet to get a new dog. \n\nI absolutely love our furry demons, although I really hate the daily litter box cleanings. We even have a couple of pricey automated litter boxes but I\u2019m still cleaning them daily because I am sensitive to the smell of urine and feces (human or animal, if I smell it I\u2019m gagging). Their only saving grace is that they have never tried to shred the leather couches or cause physical damage to my furniture. Yet.", "Nya. Also the reason I will never get a dog.", "Everyone in this family sound like they have ADHD except OP.", "Give the dog to your friend and pay no attention to your family's opinions since they refuse to fulfill their end of the bargain.  NTA.", "NTA", "NTA I\u2019ll honestly never understand how anyone just losses interest in their dog. I had friends with dogs who also lost interest but I\u2019d always give them attention and they always got so excited when I did. When I got my own dog my dad said it\u2019s my responsibility minus the vet he takes care of that for me. I\u2019ve never gotten bored or tired of him and he\u2019s almost 9 he\u2019s the best dog ever he\u2019s special to me and my family none of us are bored of him. U should rehome the dog all together if they don\u2019t step up don\u2019t hire help.", "NTA. Rehome it and give it the home it deserves. \n\nAnd hide some money.", "Are you me? NTA NTA. I\u2019m not an animal person either and I cringe everytime I hear people say I\u2019m a dog mom or dad or they refer to these animals and their human child as siblings. I don\u2019t care to pet anyone\u2019s dog not matter how \u201cfriendly\u201d it is. I will refuse to watch anyone\u2019s dog or cat for that matter. No there\u2019s no trauma anywhere in my life regarding animals, I just don\u2019t care for them. I\u2019ve had dogs in my life and I\u2019ve always made it clear I don\u2019t want to be responsible for it, period. But then what happens I\u2019m the one stuck feeding it, walking it, bathing it and cleaning up after it. \n\nAgain NTA my guy. Stick to your guns.", "NTA - absolutely nta. They are not responsibly taking care of the animal that they supposedly wanted so much. You are being very fair about this - stick to your decision.", "NTA.  They are reneging on their contract with you and really sort of abusing the dog by neglecting it.  I\u2019m glad you\u2019re holding their feet to the fire and forcing them to either do right by this animal themselves or seeing that someone else does so.  Bravo!", "NTA\n\nI would honestly just rehome it. They clearly aren't going to give it a good life. Thank you for caring and trying regardless.", "NTA. I was in the same situation where I was the only one taking care of the dog except it was my father and sister that wanted a dog. I made an agreement with my dad that I would not be taking care of the dog which he ended up completely ignoring and I helped feed and take care of the poor guy out of pity. Eventually my father left the gate open and he ran away. He claims it is not his fault whatsoever", "As a woman who got a dog her husband didn't want NTA.\n\nMy husband may need to temporarily take over some duties now that I'm pregnant again once I get too fat but will always be my dog and my responsibility and once I'm back to normal I'll take care of it all again.", "Getting a dog during Covid-19 was a bad idea. So many of these pets are now being surrendered to PETA since people have to return to work/school. The novelty has worn off. But you bought the dog as a novelty, like a Christmas present, something to get the attention of the children. However, as with any family, of course kids will promise everything under the sun to get a puppy but taking care of it rarely happens. A puppy is a huge responsibility. HUGE! Would you adopt a baby if your children promised to look after it? Of course not, so the same applies. This is a life! It requires countless hours of exercising, socializing, feeding, bathing, No kid is going to stoop to pick up the poop, if they can avoid it. Yes, a puppy is ooooh soooo cute, but they do poop, get sick, get injured, get health conditions later. It honestly does not matter if the dog likes you or not, that has nothing to do with the responsibility of taking care of a living being. If it's YOUR dog, as they say, then you can do with it as you wish and give it away, right? Seems like you are teaching a real-life lesson here: there are responsibilities involved when you decided to increase the number of your household. When you bring a life into your home, it will need care, medical bills, money, time, effort, and doing nasty stuff like picking up poop. Not the AH. Well done for putting down your boundaries and making it very clear. You did not give an ultimatum as much as you gave a solid warning. You gave 3 choices.  If you love it, prove it. Love is not just a word, it's an action. Ask the kids to demonstrate that love.", "NTA. My daughter keeps asking for another cat.  I said sure. Just take care of the one we have and I will think about it!!", "Right, kids can underestimate how much work goes into looking after a dog, they're still wrong but I can understand how that happened. But the wife is a grown adult who knows what it's like to take care of something that is completely dependent on you.", "That is hilarious.

It's great that they have that all lined up in this case, that's a good option for them. I am sorry for my mistake. I was reacting from a place of having rescued multiple dogs and having worked with a few dog rescues and animal shelters and they all have VERY LIMITED RESOURCES. In addition to this, most of the older dogs who die in shelters are the result of being \"rehomed.\" People are doing their best, but it's million miles away from being a perfect system, it fails all the time. I just wanted people to be aware that it's not a magical solution, and thought maybe more awareness of what could happen to the dog if they don't step up their game could potentially motivate the family to do better. Dogs are here to teach us about love and loyalty, and they're worth the work. I wasn't trying to be mean (Though now rereading, maybe that's how the ahole thing came off, my bad) I just saw thought I saw another option for OP and was trying to contribute to the discussion.", "And that's why my dad would refuse to go into a place if they had kittens out front \ud83e\udd23", "Yep.

But I recognize that I simply can\u2019t provide the level of care that a house full would require. I especially love cats and dogs. I discovered that I don\u2019t have the energy or health to properly care for one when I had adopted a very elderly dog.  I made sure his physical and emotional needs were met.
