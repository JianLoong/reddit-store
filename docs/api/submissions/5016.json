He became disabled after heart surgery, and then a fall, in which he broke his neck. He was no longer able to live alone, so my husband and I opened our home to him. \n\nIt\u2019s been five years, and ngl, it\u2019s been exhausting. Recently he had a health crisis that left him bedridden and incontinent. My father is a big man, and my husband has a bad back. I couldn\u2019t see either of us being able to provide care for my father without injuring ourselves or him. \n\nA little backstory: up until last year, our entire extended family and my father\u2019s church community- was all within 20-30 miles of each other in the Midwest. Last year I took a job in Phoenix. We offered my father the choice of going to assisted living or coming with us. He chose to come with us. \n\nNow that assisted living is a necessity, my father decided that he would prefer to go to a facility near his old home town. It\u2019s a fabulous place. It\u2019s clean, the food is good, they have physical therapy and other social activities, and the people who work there are kind and compassionate. Most importantly he is close to the rest of the family. He can see his grandkids, great-grandkids, and his church friends again. \n\nSince he\u2019s been there, he has made enormous progress. He\u2019s walking short distances with a walker again, getting himself out of bed and into the wheelchair on his own.  He\u2019s also getting himself to the toilet again. We\u2019re just thrilled at the progress he\u2019s made at this place. \n\nHere\u2019s the issue. Now that he\u2019s getting stronger, he\u2019s talking about coming back to live with us again. The driving force behind this is money. The cost is nearly his entire monthly income.\n\nThe AL community is all-inclusive. All of his daily living needs are met: he has his own private apartment, three meals, snacks, beverages, linen & laundry service, utilities, cable tv, physical therapy, assistance with dressing, showering, and medications.  There are community activities, social programs for fellowship.  Basically he has everything he could possibly need. But he wants to come live with my husband and I again because it\u2019s free, well nearly, he buys groceries. \n\nWe don\u2019t want him to live with us again. We\u2019ve had five years of providing pretty much all of the services he\u2019s getting at assisted living, and we\u2019re tired. Plus we\u2019ve been caregivers for so long we forgot what it\u2019s like to be a couple. We\u2019re free to take a spontaneous weekend trip by ourselves, or to laze an entire Saturday away in our pajamas watching tv. None of this was possible when my father was with us. \n\nIn addition to us living our lives again, I genuinely believe my father is better off where he is. He\u2019s safe, has access to instant health care, surrounded by family and friends. I don\u2019t want him to come home.

I know he would love to be around family, but it\u2019s not always the best solution", "NTA. Being a care giver is incredibly selfless but it takes it toll. I would find the biggest concern being yours and your husbands capacity to provide the care in a way that is safe for you and your dad. What if one of you fell while trying to assist him, you could both end up injured. The AL community sounds like it\u2019s filling all of his cups, maybe focus on all the things it provides when discussing with your dad.", "NTA\n\nCaring for elderly relatives is tiring and when it entirely falls on you and you have your own health issues it can me an absolute nightmare.\n\nYou need to take care of your health.  \n\nChances are once he moves in he will regret it because he will miss his friends, grandchildren and the facilities.\n\nHave a talk with him and see if he is being visited where he is.  It may be that it isn't as great as he was expecting and he's not getting lots of visitors.  Potentially talk to your family that is closer to see if they can set up a schedule so he does get visitors.", "NTA but when you tell him, you should highlight the second part of the reason, that the AL community is much better for him.", "NTA, its time you enjoyed your life as well as your father is better off where he is and there's a chance his quality of life would gradually decline if he comes to stay with you, along with yours. Find a way to convince your dad on what's good for everyone than everyone going off a cliff edge.", "NTA - Eldercare is HARD, especially when you are isolated from respite help from other family members or friends. Eventually,  and probably sooner than later at his age, he will need more care than you can provide again. He could end up in a position where he doesn't have the option to move back near family then. It's time for assisted living.", "Straight off no it doesn't, yes he wants to spend his money how he likes, he probably had quite alot more to play with when he lived with you and had life easy, but you didn't have any quality of life yourself, that's not fair, to keep your life as you want it, a hard conversation is going to have to be had an a firm no he can not live with you, also tell the assisted living place he has been asking and you have refused his request, basically so he can not pack up an organise to move without telling you an land on your doorstep", "NAH - your father is safe and God forbid he has another fall he will already be in an environment that is equipped to take care of him. \n\nAt his it\u2019s hard to make friends and considering you\u2019re living in a new place he would be extremely isolated not to mention the toll it would place on you and your husband to have that responsibility again.", "NAH. Have an honest conversation about the benefits of staying at the facility. And make a point to visit often and have quality time together.", "NTA. It\u2019s a huge job taking care of someone and I think your father is being unfair when he has another option. It\u2019s okay for you to put your own life first, even if you feel a bit guilty.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry dad, you have excelled so well because of where you are at and the full time care which they provide.  With our age and bodies, we can no longer take care of you as we once were able to.  Also, he went to that facility for a reason.  More family is there.  Church.  If he were to move back with you, he would lose all those things and sitting around us not good for his health.  Also, there is other family?  Why is he not living with them or this being an option?  Say not doable any longer and stick to it.", "NTA\nThis scenario is staring me square in my face and I genuinely don't know if I'm built to be that level of caretaker.\n\nYou've got my sympathy.  \n\nBut on the subject, his monthly income shouldn't be an issue for him.  If he's got everything he needs, this is what the income is for.  Maybe send him a small monthly stipend as a gift so he feels like you care and his has some spare change each month.  Go visit with him as often as you can.  Cook meals in his apartment.  Maybe he will decide the facility is his home if he feels like he's hosting you.", "NTA don't tell him how inconvenient it was for you though. Just how much better his life is there and you can't give him the level of care he needs", "I think you have done and still continue to do what is best for your dad.\n\nNTA at all, you are a great daughter. Don't regret anything.", "NTA. I was the carer for my parent for 8 years until their death at home with me. I\u2019m ultimately glad I did, but it was also because I couldn\u2019t afford to put them into a decent home. That\u2019s 8 years of my life gone though. It meant I missed out on socialising, relationships & my professional life. It was so hard on me physically & mentally & I assume I\u2019m younger than you both. Don\u2019t take him back. He\u2019s safe & well. Doesn\u2019t matter if he can afford it, but would rather be cheap. You did your bit. Continue living life as couple.", "NTA", "NTA. But I don\u2019t get it, what\u2019s he saving the money for? Without being crass, I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s not saving for a wild holiday or anything? If he can afford to stay in this accommodation, then it\u2019s clearly the best outcome, evidenced by the progress he\u2019s made to this point.", "Nta", "NTA. You and your husband are both in your 60's. You cannot possibly provide long term 24-hour care. Who will take care of your father if (when) one of you needs to be hospitalized or is incapacitated, even in the short term?", "There's no way you could be the A in this situation after providing 5 years of intense, constant care for him. You've taken your turn, now live your life. Time for someone else to take their turn. \n\nEither he stays in AL or someone else has to take him in. It's quite simple, the answer is NO. \n\nProblem is figuring out how to say it. \n\nIf he tries to guilt you about it, just keep reminding him of the 5 years you have cared for him and that you need a rest. Be honest. He'll see through it if you're not.", "NTA, not at all. Your father is better off if he stays where he is, and you're better off if he stays where he is. Unfortunately, he very possibly doesn't realize how much of a burden it is to care for someone his age who need that kind of assistance with daily living. He's in a good situation now, with ready access to all the help he needs, *and* he has the income to pay for it.... he's ever so much better off there. Yes, he's made a lot of progress, but it's very likely that he'll have more health problems in the future and will need so much more than you're able to provide safely.", "NTA but you will have to be firm with him. Hes not going to like it but dont let your father move back in. If the rest of the family gives you grief let them take him in. You've done your part.", "NTA but is there a way you can assist with money?", "That he wasn't getting much in the way of visitors was my first thought.", "Nta and it won't be long before he goes downhill again and you're back to square one.", "NTA. He\u2019s only doing well because of the therapy and support he gets from professionals in the AL. He would become weak and sick again with you. You are older and deserve a good life. You know that he is well cared for, and he can afford it. Make plans to visit him, he probably misses you both.", "NTA. You and your husband have provided as much as you can. Another health crisis for him, or you and your husband can happen at any time. Your father is in a good place near other family and friends who can help.", "NTA - Tell your father your reasons as explained here. Make it clear that you and your husband cannot care for him like at the AL community.", "NTA, it might just be a hard truth to share with him but he\u2019s better there. If he really doesn\u2019t want to be in the AL facility anymore, perhaps it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn to take him in?", "NTA. He is better off, and he can afford it. So what if it costs most of his income? That's what it's for. He is getting accommodation and professional care. Maybe he'd rather have that \"for free\" - but that is basically putting the cost on you.", "NTA.\n\nYou have done your share. It's time for other family members to contribute. You have a life to live.\n\nExplain to him gently but FIRMLY that it is best he stays where he is.", "NTA\n\nHe is doing so well because of the therapy and assistance he is getting in assisted living.\n\nYou can't match that. I'd consider asking how he intends to match that.\n\nWill he pay for occupational therapists to come out three times a week, a dailly visit from a nurse etc. Obviously he needs that level of care etc.\n\nOne of my uncles is in his 90s and he has a lot of health problems but he is under care at home.  Its barely cheaper than moving into assisted living.", "NTA. You\u2019ve already done a lot.", "NTA. You will be unable to care for him before too long. Trying to do so will not only take away most of the precious time you have left with your husband, it could use up some, or all, of the strength and health YOU have left, and lessen the healthy, strong time YOU have left. While not gaining your father anything.  Take it from a widow. Your father doesn\u2019t realize what he\u2019s asking. He\u2019ll get used to it. He\u2019ll be glad to see you when you visit.", "NTA - it might be a hard truth for your father to swallow but where he is is the best place for him. What if he has another injury or setback (a real possibility at his stage in life), then what happens? You're not in a position to care for him but you're not near friends/family either. That's really an undue burden on you and a huge stressor.\n\nBeing a caregiver is GRUELING. My grandma lived with us for about five years and she was reasonably self-sufficient for three of them - we had my mom, me and my sis taking care of her, and it was still really tough. Someone always needed to be in or near the house, it was constant worry, we had to make a lot of adjustments to our living to accommodate her needs. It was a LOT. Caregiver burnout is very, very real.\n\nAfter five years, she took a pretty bad fall and ended up having to go into an assisted living place as the care she needed was beyond the level we could provide without in home nursing and one of us quitting our jobs (not a possibility for any of us). It sucked and was a HUGE adjustment for my grandma, but it was the best of a bunch of not-so-great options, unfortunately.", "NTA. He needs the home and services he's getting at the place he's at and is healthier and cared for. You two aren't professional home health aides and that's exactly what he needs. Leave him in the facility and enjoy your home and lives as a couple.\n\nYou don't owe anyone space in your home.", "nta but is there something he feels he needs extra money for? would it be possible to consider some type of monthly allowance?", "NTA  What is his plan for his income if he moves back in with you?  God bless his penny-pinching soul.  Tell him he is going to have to pay for a 24-hour helper and utilities, when he comes back.", "NTA.  Tell him your health and hubs health won\u2019t allow.  Also bring up the leaps and bounds improvements that he made at the facility versus your place.  \n\nWould it help if yo gave dad a small allowance. Thinking $100-200 a month so he has a little bit to be able to afford some luxuries?", "[removed]", "Agreed but if I were OP I would not say that they need a rest but that they believe they are physically incapable of providing the care he needs. \n\nI would also check that he is getting visits because having all that other family close enough to visit but not visiting would be a 100 times harder than just telling oneself that they would visit if only I was nearby.\n\nPerhaps he is worried about money because he wants to leave an inheritance. If there is any way to assure him that nobody wants to inherit because everyone wants him to use the money he earned to pay for his needs that could be good. Of course, if it was not previously a concern then bringing it up would be awkward. He could also be worried about money because if he is just breaking even now, when he needs a higher level of assistance, will the costs increase and he is afraid of not being able to pay for it?", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/Glittering-Fan-1679 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zoua0u/aita_for_not_letting_my_elderly_father_live_with/j0pbn0m/\n\nBot Reported."]}
