He became disabled after heart surgery, and then a fall, in which he broke his neck. He was no longer able to live alone, so my husband and I opened our home to him. \n\nIt\u2019s been five years, and ngl, it\u2019s been exhausting. Recently he had a health crisis that left him bedridden and incontinent. My father is a big man, and my husband has a bad back. I couldn\u2019t see either of us being able to provide care for my father without injuring ourselves or him. \n\nA little backstory: up until last year, our entire extended family and my father\u2019s church community- was all within 20-30 miles of each other in the Midwest. Last year I took a job in Phoenix. We offered my father the choice of going to assisted living or coming with us. He chose to come with us. \n\nNow that assisted living is a necessity, my father decided that he would prefer to go to a facility near his old home town. It\u2019s a fabulous place. It\u2019s clean, the food is good, they have physical therapy and other social activities, and the people who work there are kind and compassionate. Most importantly he is close to the rest of the family. He can see his grandkids, great-grandkids, and his church friends again. \n\nSince he\u2019s been there, he has made enormous progress. He\u2019s walking short distances with a walker again, getting himself out of bed and into the wheelchair on his own.  He\u2019s also getting himself to the toilet again. We\u2019re just thrilled at the progress he\u2019s made at this place. \n\nHere\u2019s the issue. Now that he\u2019s getting stronger, he\u2019s talking about coming back to live with us again. The driving force behind this is money. The cost is nearly his entire monthly income.\n\nThe AL community is all-inclusive. All of his daily living needs are met: he has his own private apartment, three meals, snacks, beverages, linen & laundry service, utilities, cable tv, physical therapy, assistance with dressing, showering, and medications.  There are community activities, social programs for fellowship.  Basically he has everything he could possibly need. But he wants to come live with my husband and I again because it\u2019s free, well nearly, he buys groceries. \n\nWe don\u2019t want him to live with us again. We\u2019ve had five years of providing pretty much all of the services he\u2019s getting at assisted living, and we\u2019re tired. Plus we\u2019ve been caregivers for so long we forgot what it\u2019s like to be a couple. We\u2019re free to take a spontaneous weekend trip by ourselves, or to laze an entire Saturday away in our pajamas watching tv. None of this was possible when my father was with us. \n\nIn addition to us living our lives again, I genuinely believe my father is better off where he is. He\u2019s safe, has access to instant health care, surrounded by family and friends. I don\u2019t want him to come home.

I know he would love to be around family, but it\u2019s not always the best solution", "NTA. Being a care giver is incredibly selfless but it takes it toll. I would find the biggest concern being yours and your husbands capacity to provide the care in a way that is safe for you and your dad. What if one of you fell while trying to assist him, you could both end up injured. The AL community sounds like it\u2019s filling all of his cups, maybe focus on all the things it provides when discussing with your dad.", "NTA\n\nCaring for elderly relatives is tiring and when it entirely falls on you and you have your own health issues it can me an absolute nightmare.\n\nYou need to take care of your health.  \n\nChances are once he moves in he will regret it because he will miss his friends, grandchildren and the facilities.\n\nHave a talk with him and see if he is being visited where he is.  It may be that it isn't as great as he was expecting and he's not getting lots of visitors.  Potentially talk to your family that is closer to see if they can set up a schedule so he does get visitors.", "NTA but when you tell him, you should highlight the second part of the reason, that the AL community is much better for him.", "NTA, its time you enjoyed your life as well as your father is better off where he is and there's a chance his quality of life would gradually decline if he comes to stay with you, along with yours. Find a way to convince your dad on what's good for everyone than everyone going off a cliff edge.", "NTA - Eldercare is HARD, especially when you are isolated from respite help from other family members or friends. Eventually,  and probably sooner than later at his age, he will need more care than you can provide again. He could end up in a position where he doesn't have the option to move back near family then. It's time for assisted living.", "Straight off no it doesn't, yes he wants to spend his money how he likes, he probably had quite alot more to play with when he lived with you and had life easy, but you didn't have any quality of life yourself, that's not fair, to keep your life as you want it, a hard conversation is going to have to be had an a firm no he can not live with you, also tell the assisted living place he has been asking and you have refused his request, basically so he can not pack up an organise to move without telling you an land on your doorstep", "NAH - your father is safe and God forbid he has another fall he will already be in an environment that is equipped to take care of him. \n\nAt his it\u2019s hard to make friends and considering you\u2019re living in a new place he would be extremely isolated not to mention the toll it would place on you and your husband to have that responsibility again.", "NAH. Have an honest conversation about the benefits of staying at the facility. And make a point to visit often and have quality time together.", "NTA. It\u2019s a huge job taking care of someone and I think your father is being unfair when he has another option. It\u2019s okay for you to put your own life first, even if you feel a bit guilty.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
