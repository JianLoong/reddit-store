Also, he went to that facility for a reason.  More family is there.  Church.  If he were to move back with you, he would lose all those things and sitting around us not good for his health.

If he's got everything he needs, this is what the income is for.  Maybe send him a small monthly stipend as a gift so he feels like you care and his has some spare change each month.

He's in a good situation now, with ready access to all the help he needs, *and* he has the income to pay for it.... he's ever so much better off there.

I'd consider asking how he intends to match that.\n\nWill he pay for occupational therapists to come out three times a week, a dailly visit from a nurse etc. Obviously he needs that level of care etc.\n\nOne of my uncles is in his 90s and he has a lot of health problems but he is under care at home.  Its barely cheaper than moving into assisted living.", "NTA. You\u2019ve already done a lot.", "NTA. You will be unable to care for him before too long.

He\u2019ll be glad to see you when you visit.", "NTA - it might be a hard truth for your father to swallow but where he is is the best place for him. What if he has another injury or setback (a real possibility at his stage in life), then what happens? You're not in a position to care for him but you're not near friends/family either. That's really an undue burden on you and a huge stressor.\n\nBeing a caregiver is GRUELING. My grandma lived with us for about five years and she was reasonably self-sufficient for three of them - we had my mom, me and my sis taking care of her, and it was still really tough. Someone always needed to be in or near the house, it was constant worry, we had to make a lot of adjustments to our living to accommodate her needs. It was a LOT. Caregiver burnout is very, very real.\n\nAfter five years, she took a pretty bad fall and ended up having to go into an assisted living place as the care she needed was beyond the level we could provide without in home nursing and one of us quitting our jobs (not a possibility for any of us). It sucked and was a HUGE adjustment for my grandma, but it was the best of a bunch of not-so-great options, unfortunately.", "NTA. He needs the home and services he's getting at the place he's at and is healthier and cared for. You two aren't professional home health aides and that's exactly what he needs. Leave him in the facility and enjoy your home and lives as a couple.\n\nYou don't owe anyone space in your home.", "nta but is there something he feels he needs extra money for? would it be possible to consider some type of monthly allowance?", "NTA  What is his plan for his income if he moves back in with you?  God bless his penny-pinching soul.  Tell him he is going to have to pay for a 24-hour helper and utilities, when he comes back.", "NTA.  Tell him your health and hubs health won\u2019t allow.  Also bring up the leaps and bounds improvements that he made at the facility versus your place.  \n\nWould it help if yo gave dad a small allowance. Thinking $100-200 a month so he has a little bit to be able to afford some luxuries?", "[removed]", "Agreed but if I were OP I would not say that they need a rest but that they believe they are physically incapable of providing the care he needs. \n\nI would also check that he is getting visits because having all that other family close enough to visit but not visiting would be a 100 times harder than just telling oneself that they would visit if only I was nearby.\n\nPerhaps he is worried about money because he wants to leave an inheritance. If there is any way to assure him that nobody wants to inherit because everyone wants him to use the money he earned to pay for his needs that could be good. Of course, if it was not previously a concern then bringing it up would be awkward. He could also be worried about money because if he is just breaking even now, when he needs a higher level of assistance, will the costs increase and he is afraid of not being able to pay for it?", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/Glittering-Fan-1679 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zoua0u/aita_for_not_letting_my_elderly_father_live_with/j0pbn0m/\n\nBot Reported.", "NTA, it's not actually free for your father to live with you. What your father is saying is that he doesn't view the cost of your labor and time as equal to his monetary cost.\n\nYour father is saying that he would rather live with you because you'd have to pay less money, at the direct sacrifice of your time and labor. It doesn't make you an asshole to defend your boundaries. That is your moral responsibility to do since you have no dependents, you and your spouse come first.", "NTA. I have worked in long term care for over 8 years and I see people who should have been living there long before they made the decision to move in. While I understand it is hard to accept when a family member or yourself needs more help than they can get at home, it is so important to recognize where they will best thrive. It sounds like your father is doing much better with the help of rehabilitation and having immediate access to medical care. The most important thing I have learned while working in a caregiving field is that a person needs to take care of themself first in order to take care of others. You cannot provide them with your best self if you are constantly putting their needs ahead of your own. If taking your father in interferes with your ability to care for your own needs and puts your safety (and his) at risk, then it is best for everyone to have him live in an assisted living. With that being said, be sure to do your research on the facility he is living in and make occasional or frequent visits in person to make sure he is being provided quality care and to be his advocate. Not all assisted living facilities are equal. Some are amazing and compassionate, while others are focused on profits at the expense of the people who live there. If you DO decide to take your father in again, there are extremely helpful caregiver support groups where you learn to care for yourself first and are connected with others who have been in similar situations and can share their experiences. I also recommend taking advantage of respite services where you could have in home caregivers or have a set up where your father spends a few days to a week every month or so in an assisted living in order for you and your husband to take a break from being the primary caregivers. I am not sure if this is provided in all states, but I live in a Midwestern state where this is quite common. I wish you the best of luck in whichever decision you make!", "op=NTA\n\nbut if you can spare the money, maybe make him a monthly allowance so he has a bit on top of what his costs are.", "NTA.  Also, there is a /caregivers sub here you might find helpful for general support and resources.

He\u2019s not going to use it. The only reason he wants to save money is so that he can give it to you and his other children and grandchildren. Reassure him that you\u2019re going to be okay without his money, that he should spend it getting excellent care and that you\u2019d rather have him on this earth for longer living in the facility than have his money without him.", "NTA unfortunately he needs the care and you know how intensive it can be maybe offer to send him a little $ of you have extra so he can have a little more spending money.", "NTA.

He really needs help if he gets sick again which is always the case.  My late mom in law moved into AL after living alone for years and years after her husband passed away.  Her sons (one of them is my late husband) used to rush to her home if the phone  (her daughter called from other state) isn't answered, sure enough she passed out and was rushed to ER, etc. several times. So she relented and moved to AL.  She was much happier and more active until health issues overtook her that she ended up in a nursing home for a couple of months before her death at age of 90 or 91.  So we all felt peace when she moved into AL.  So rest assured that you won't feel guilty when you told him no and stay in AL that he really needs the most.

Additionally, he's getting the care he needs there.  You can't give him that same level of care.  Also, what if he leaves and his health declines again?  You can't guarantee that facility will still have a spot for him.  He might end up somewhere else with far fewer amenities at a far higher cost.\n\nI went through something similar with my in-laws.  I don't want to get into details but it was an unmitigated disaster.", "Absolutely NTA. He could never get all the services that place provides for what he's paying now, so complaining about the price is nonsense. As for you two taking over, even if he offered to pay you what he pays them (which I know, he's not, but best with me here), you do not have the medical equipment or training, the food and cooking supplies, the entertainment resources, or the easy access to social activities that they do. But more important is that you two were on 24/7/365 for him and that will harm you both physically and mentally. The home has a professionally trained staff with set hours and the ability to call in if they're sick, to book vacations for longer rests, they have EI and workers comp if they're injured on the job. You are *not* equipped for this and your dad can feel how he feels about that, but you two need to know your limits to protect the quality and safety of *all three* of your daily lives, and saying \"no, I'm sorry, we're no longer capable of taking on the level of care you need and deserve\" is a kindness, no matter what anyone else has to say about it.", "NTA\n\nApart from the fact that it's emotionally and physically draining to take care of an elderly person.

But, just to cite one example, you cannot be there every--single--time he needs to get up out of his chair or bed, and so you cannot prevent another fall.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are making a clear assessment of your abilities.

I had one family decimated in 2 months when the matriarch caregiver died.

Too many times seeing elderly parents of disabled adult children who have no plan for where their children will live snd who will care for them when they cannot.
