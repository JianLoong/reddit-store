Sorry dad, you have excelled so well because of where you are at and the full time care which they provide.  With our age and bodies, we can no longer take care of you as we once were able to.  Also, he went to that facility for a reason.  More family is there.  Church.  If he were to move back with you, he would lose all those things and sitting around us not good for his health.

If he's got everything he needs, this is what the income is for.  Maybe send him a small monthly stipend as a gift so he feels like you care and his has some spare change each month.

He's in a good situation now, with ready access to all the help he needs, *and* he has the income to pay for it.... he's ever so much better off there.

I'd consider asking how he intends to match that.\n\nWill he pay for occupational therapists to come out three times a week, a dailly visit from a nurse etc. Obviously he needs that level of care etc.\n\nOne of my uncles is in his 90s and he has a lot of health problems but he is under care at home.  Its barely cheaper than moving into assisted living.", "NTA. You\u2019ve already done a lot.", "NTA. You will be unable to care for him before too long.

He\u2019ll be glad to see you when you visit.", "NTA - it might be a hard truth for your father to swallow but where he is is the best place for him. What if he has another injury or setback (a real possibility at his stage in life), then what happens? You're not in a position to care for him but you're not near friends/family either. That's really an undue burden on you and a huge stressor.\n\nBeing a caregiver is GRUELING. My grandma lived with us for about five years and she was reasonably self-sufficient for three of them - we had my mom, me and my sis taking care of her, and it was still really tough. Someone always needed to be in or near the house, it was constant worry, we had to make a lot of adjustments to our living to accommodate her needs. It was a LOT. Caregiver burnout is very, very real.\n\nAfter five years, she took a pretty bad fall and ended up having to go into an assisted living place as the care she needed was beyond the level we could provide without in home nursing and one of us quitting our jobs (not a possibility for any of us). It sucked and was a HUGE adjustment for my grandma, but it was the best of a bunch of not-so-great options, unfortunately.", "NTA. He needs the home and services he's getting at the place he's at and is healthier and cared for. You two aren't professional home health aides and that's exactly what he needs. Leave him in the facility and enjoy your home and lives as a couple.\n\nYou don't owe anyone space in your home.", "nta but is there something he feels he needs extra money for? would it be possible to consider some type of monthly allowance?", "NTA  What is his plan for his income if he moves back in with you?  God bless his penny-pinching soul.  Tell him he is going to have to pay for a 24-hour helper and utilities, when he comes back.", "NTA.  Tell him your health and hubs health won\u2019t allow.  Also bring up the leaps and bounds improvements that he made at the facility versus your place.  \n\nWould it help if yo gave dad a small allowance. Thinking $100-200 a month so he has a little bit to be able to afford some luxuries?", "[removed]", "Agreed but if I were OP I would not say that they need a rest but that they believe they are physically incapable of providing the care he needs. \n\nI would also check that he is getting visits because having all that other family close enough to visit but not visiting would be a 100 times harder than just telling oneself that they would visit if only I was nearby.\n\nPerhaps he is worried about money because he wants to leave an inheritance. If there is any way to assure him that nobody wants to inherit because everyone wants him to use the money he earned to pay for his needs that could be good. Of course, if it was not previously a concern then bringing it up would be awkward. He could also be worried about money because if he is just breaking even now, when he needs a higher level of assistance, will the costs increase and he is afraid of not being able to pay for it?", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/Glittering-Fan-1679 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zoua0u/aita_for_not_letting_my_elderly_father_live_with/j0pbn0m/\n\nBot Reported.", "NTA, it's not actually free for your father to live with you. What your father is saying is that he doesn't view the cost of your labor and time as equal to his monetary cost.\n\nYour father is saying that he would rather live with you because you'd have to pay less money, at the direct sacrifice of your time and labor. It doesn't make you an asshole to defend your boundaries. That is your moral responsibility to do since you have no dependents, you and your spouse come first.", "NTA. I have worked in long term care for over 8 years and I see people who should have been living there long before they made the decision to move in. While I understand it is hard to accept when a family member or yourself needs more help than they can get at home, it is so important to recognize where they will best thrive. It sounds like your father is doing much better with the help of rehabilitation and having immediate access to medical care. The most important thing I have learned while working in a caregiving field is that a person needs to take care of themself first in order to take care of others. You cannot provide them with your best self if you are constantly putting their needs ahead of your own. If taking your father in interferes with your ability to care for your own needs and puts your safety (and his) at risk, then it is best for everyone to have him live in an assisted living. With that being said, be sure to do your research on the facility he is living in and make occasional or frequent visits in person to make sure he is being provided quality care and to be his advocate. Not all assisted living facilities are equal. Some are amazing and compassionate, while others are focused on profits at the expense of the people who live there. If you DO decide to take your father in again, there are extremely helpful caregiver support groups where you learn to care for yourself first and are connected with others who have been in similar situations and can share their experiences. I also recommend taking advantage of respite services where you could have in home caregivers or have a set up where your father spends a few days to a week every month or so in an assisted living in order for you and your husband to take a break from being the primary caregivers. I am not sure if this is provided in all states, but I live in a Midwestern state where this is quite common. I wish you the best of luck in whichever decision you make!", "op=NTA\n\nbut if you can spare the money, maybe make him a monthly allowance so he has a bit on top of what his costs are.", "NTA.  Also, there is a /caregivers sub here you might find helpful for general support and resources.

He\u2019s not going to use it. The only reason he wants to save money is so that he can give it to you and his other children and grandchildren. Reassure him that you\u2019re going to be okay without his money, that he should spend it getting excellent care and that you\u2019d rather have him on this earth for longer living in the facility than have his money without him.", "NTA unfortunately he needs the care and you know how intensive it can be maybe offer to send him a little $ of you have extra so he can have a little more spending money.", "NTA.

Gramps, you are IN retirement and you\u2019re having a great time.

Its exhausting and physically wearing.  \n\nIf other people have an opinion about his care then they should step up to the plate !", "NTA\n\nHe needs to stay safe where he is in.  He's 87.  He really needs help if he gets sick again which is always the case.  My late mom in law moved into AL after living alone for years and years after her husband passed away.  Her sons (one of them is my late husband) used to rush to her home if the phone  (her daughter called from other state) isn't answered, sure enough she passed out and was rushed to ER, etc. several times. So she relented and moved to AL.  She was much happier and more active until health issues overtook her that she ended up in a nursing home for a couple of months before her death at age of 90 or 91.

Additionally, he's getting the care he needs there.  You can't give him that same level of care.  Also, what if he leaves and his health declines again?  You can't guarantee that facility will still have a spot for him.  He might end up somewhere else with far fewer amenities at a far higher cost.\n\nI went through something similar with my in-laws.  I don't want to get into details but it was an unmitigated disaster.", "Absolutely NTA. He could never get all the services that place provides for what he's paying now, so complaining about the price is nonsense. As for you two taking over, even if he offered to pay you what he pays them (which I know, he's not, but best with me here), you do not have the medical equipment or training, the food and cooking supplies, the entertainment resources, or the easy access to social activities that they do. But more important is that you two were on 24/7/365 for him and that will harm you both physically and mentally. The home has a professionally trained staff with set hours and the ability to call in if they're sick, to book vacations for longer rests, they have EI and workers comp if they're injured on the job. You are *not* equipped for this and your dad can feel how he feels about that, but you two need to know your limits to protect the quality and safety of *all three* of your daily lives, and saying \"no, I'm sorry, we're no longer capable of taking on the level of care you need and deserve\" is a kindness, no matter what anyone else has to say about it.", "NTA\n\nApart from the fact that it's emotionally and physically draining to take care of an elderly person. And apart from the fact you both would pretty much work two jobs each.\n\nYou're very unlikely to be able to meet all.his needs which is due to the fact that you're not a professional care giver. \n\nAlso it's safer for him there. What happens when he falls.while you guys are at work?", "NTA for the simple fact that your father is much better off where he is.  Taking him away from the facility would put you and him at risk of injury.  He needs to stay where he is.", "NTA. Make sure he understands that you don't want ot need an inheritance and that you'd rather he stay where he is because of all of the reasons you outlined.", "NTA.   \nYou and your husband stepped up for 5 years. In that time your own circumstances have changed. You and your husband are dealing with your own issues of aging in your 60s. You are not required to lose your health, risk injury or early death for your father's benefit.  Tell him that he cannot move back in with you and your husband. Talk with your extended family about this as well even though some of them will be AHs and insist that you're wrong for not wanting him there with you. It is a health and safety issue for you, your hubby and your father. Good luck! Please update us if you can.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYour father is much better where he is both physically and socially.   He needs to stay where he is.  \n\nAll of you are only getting older.  His condition could change at any moment and so could yours.\n\nOne of my most heart-breaking days was moving my dad into longterm care.  There was no choice.  His care had become too much to handle at home so I understand how much it took out of you for those 5 years.\n\nYour dad is doing well where he is.  Please strongly encourage his family to visit him at least once a week.\n\nIf he needs more money hopefully you have siblings who can also contribute.  Right now all his costs are covered but might there be something in the future that he will need (eg wheelchair, physio, hearing aids) that he won't have extra money for?  Even if it falls to you, it would be less expensive to cover those future costs than to have him live with you.", "NAH.\n\nHe may be daydreaming about things he would do with the money that are no longer physically possible.  He also doesn't realize that he's doing so well *because he is in assisted living.*  If he came back to live with you he would *not* be receiving the same level of care and his health might well get worse.  I don't mean that you are not good caregivers.  But, just to cite one example, you cannot be there every--single--time he needs to get up out of his chair or bed, and so you cannot prevent another fall.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are making a clear assessment of your abilities.  You can't replace round-the-clock shifts of trained caregivers.  You just can't.  You have to frickin' sleep.\n\nETA: When my elderly SIL, who had a comparable series of health issues, started talking the same way, her AL facility scheduled a care conference at which her doctor, her nurses, and her adult daughter all explained to her what would most likely happen if she attempted to live on her own again.  It might be time for one of those.", "NTA but maybe you could send him a little money every month so that he'll have personal spending money. And you could still visit him.", "NTA  He\u2019s in a good place, and making progress because of it.  You are both in a good place, able to now live your lives.  He wants to throw all of this away for money, and you have to stand up and say no.  If other members of the family or church disagree, they can step in themselves, but you are allowed to say no.  Going backwards would be very bad for all of you.", "NTA.\n\nBetter for him to stay where he thrives and he's already settled; if this is a money issue for him, you may be able to give him a monthly stipend for his use? Cheaper and easier than housing him, but he still has cash to flash for any extras.", "NTA. After my grandmother died my grandfather moved in with us. Biggest mistake we ever made. I've essentially become his carer, cleaner, cook, maid, servant. I hate it and I hate him now. I wish we'd put him in a nursing home. \n\nSometimes you have to put yourself first. A nursing home would be the best thing for you and for him.", "NTA you're already in your sixties, taking care of yourself itself is hard.  But where i come from, it's your duty to take care of your elderly parents. I hope you provide financially some help if you are able to so it is affordable for him to stay there, also visit him.\nI guess it's not only because of the cost, he likes being with you,  his daughter despite getting good care and close to family and friends.", "Nta. Be honest with him. Tell him his quality of life is better where he is & that the burden of having him with you will make you all unhappy. He's close to family, friends & is in a facility that can take care of his needs a million times better than you can on your own. His quality of life matters more than being with you h your husband. While it may hurt his feelings, it is what's in his best interests.", "Except... He is around family. More than if he lived with OP. The only difference being in assisted living they have to come to him.\n\n\nOP, it's not really what you want to provide as an option, but it never hurts to throw out ideas. You could tell him that living with you will not be free except for groceries. He'll still have to pay for all those services he's currently getting. They'll just be from your home instead of the AL facility. Call around if you and find out how much it would be and tell him. I bet he'll decline the offer then. It's also not a good idea because I'm sure you'll get backlash from other family members.\n\nAnother reason he may want to move back with you is he can go back to his lazy old self. He won't have to put in the work to improve his physical well being.\n\nIn short, don't do it. But there's an idea for you even though no is a full sentance.", "Also I think OP should volunteer to pay a portion of the cost if it\u2019s feasible. It\u2019s not fun living with 0 disposable income and I can understand that not being a pleasant future for dad. Maybe you can work a couple of extra shifts per month or find a side job if needed which still sounds like it would be less work than taking care of him.", "That's right here, him saying that he's saving dollar amounts because you and your husband pick up all of the real expenses, time and labor, is your father being selfish.\n\nRefuse the request and make it clear that he needs to stay exactly where he is", "Yeah, I'm wondering whether OP would be able to (albeit under heavy criticism, I guarantee) tally up the costs that OP and husband incurred and tell him he would need to share the costs. Not only because of him making them spend more on utilities and space and freedom, but also because they're putting their bodies and well-being at risk too.", "Indeed, honestly I think it's something you should bring up when you have your next conversation with him and lay down the boundary. What does he think is so important to save his money for that saving those dollars for himself matter more than you and your husband not being exhausted and taking care of him all day?", "He definitely won\u2019t get that same Level of care if leaves his assisted living. His progress could regress and it\u2019s only going to get harder as he gets older. NTA", "my grandma is in a home and its really one of the best ones in our area. she has friends there and constant care, its pretty well situated so everyone can visit her. yet after all these years she still complains about how shed rather live at home by herself. she can barely walk without her walker, stairs are a no go (her old apartment was on the first floor no elevator) she doesnt even know how to cook!! yet shed still rather live back at home on her own? i fully agree with you on this.", "I understand why you\u2019d suggest this but it could backfire terribly. And it\u2019s not respectful to herself or her dad. \n\nShe needs to tell the truth.", "OP should say what she means and not play weird mind games with her father. Elder care is complicated enough as it is.", "I think Americans in particular have this perverse, divorced-from-reality concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d that has much more to do with what you can consume/own than what you can *do*, and it\u2019s closely tied to homeownership, and that all comes to a really ugly head with people\u2019s elder care decisions.\n\nHence, you have people who insist on living in homes they can\u2019t care for, can\u2019t navigate, can\u2019t maintain social relationships from, can\u2019t easily leave to access necessities, because at least they can say they live in their own home, and delude themselves that they\u2019re not dependent on the resources much more easily accessible in a shared living facility. It\u2019s really, really sad."]}
