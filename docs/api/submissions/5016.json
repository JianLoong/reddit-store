Also, he went to that facility for a reason.  More family is there.  Church.  If he were to move back with you, he would lose all those things and sitting around us not good for his health.

If he's got everything he needs, this is what the income is for.  Maybe send him a small monthly stipend as a gift so he feels like you care and his has some spare change each month.

He's in a good situation now, with ready access to all the help he needs, *and* he has the income to pay for it.... he's ever so much better off there.

I'd consider asking how he intends to match that.\n\nWill he pay for occupational therapists to come out three times a week, a dailly visit from a nurse etc. Obviously he needs that level of care etc.\n\nOne of my uncles is in his 90s and he has a lot of health problems but he is under care at home.  Its barely cheaper than moving into assisted living.", "NTA. You\u2019ve already done a lot.", "NTA. You will be unable to care for him before too long.

He\u2019ll be glad to see you when you visit.", "NTA - it might be a hard truth for your father to swallow but where he is is the best place for him. What if he has another injury or setback (a real possibility at his stage in life), then what happens? You're not in a position to care for him but you're not near friends/family either. That's really an undue burden on you and a huge stressor.\n\nBeing a caregiver is GRUELING. My grandma lived with us for about five years and she was reasonably self-sufficient for three of them - we had my mom, me and my sis taking care of her, and it was still really tough. Someone always needed to be in or near the house, it was constant worry, we had to make a lot of adjustments to our living to accommodate her needs. It was a LOT. Caregiver burnout is very, very real.\n\nAfter five years, she took a pretty bad fall and ended up having to go into an assisted living place as the care she needed was beyond the level we could provide without in home nursing and one of us quitting our jobs (not a possibility for any of us). It sucked and was a HUGE adjustment for my grandma, but it was the best of a bunch of not-so-great options, unfortunately.", "NTA. He needs the home and services he's getting at the place he's at and is healthier and cared for. You two aren't professional home health aides and that's exactly what he needs. Leave him in the facility and enjoy your home and lives as a couple.\n\nYou don't owe anyone space in your home.", "nta but is there something he feels he needs extra money for? would it be possible to consider some type of monthly allowance?", "NTA  What is his plan for his income if he moves back in with you?  God bless his penny-pinching soul.  Tell him he is going to have to pay for a 24-hour helper and utilities, when he comes back.", "NTA.  Tell him your health and hubs health won\u2019t allow.  Also bring up the leaps and bounds improvements that he made at the facility versus your place.  \n\nWould it help if yo gave dad a small allowance. Thinking $100-200 a month so he has a little bit to be able to afford some luxuries?", "[removed]", "Agreed but if I were OP I would not say that they need a rest but that they believe they are physically incapable of providing the care he needs. \n\nI would also check that he is getting visits because having all that other family close enough to visit but not visiting would be a 100 times harder than just telling oneself that they would visit if only I was nearby.\n\nPerhaps he is worried about money because he wants to leave an inheritance. If there is any way to assure him that nobody wants to inherit because everyone wants him to use the money he earned to pay for his needs that could be good. Of course, if it was not previously a concern then bringing it up would be awkward. He could also be worried about money because if he is just breaking even now, when he needs a higher level of assistance, will the costs increase and he is afraid of not being able to pay for it?", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/Glittering-Fan-1679 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zoua0u/aita_for_not_letting_my_elderly_father_live_with/j0pbn0m/\n\nBot Reported.", "NTA, it's not actually free for your father to live with you. What your father is saying is that he doesn't view the cost of your labor and time as equal to his monetary cost.\n\nYour father is saying that he would rather live with you because you'd have to pay less money, at the direct sacrifice of your time and labor. It doesn't make you an asshole to defend your boundaries. That is your moral responsibility to do since you have no dependents, you and your spouse come first.", "NTA. I have worked in long term care for over 8 years and I see people who should have been living there long before they made the decision to move in. While I understand it is hard to accept when a family member or yourself needs more help than they can get at home, it is so important to recognize where they will best thrive. It sounds like your father is doing much better with the help of rehabilitation and having immediate access to medical care. The most important thing I have learned while working in a caregiving field is that a person needs to take care of themself first in order to take care of others. You cannot provide them with your best self if you are constantly putting their needs ahead of your own. If taking your father in interferes with your ability to care for your own needs and puts your safety (and his) at risk, then it is best for everyone to have him live in an assisted living. With that being said, be sure to do your research on the facility he is living in and make occasional or frequent visits in person to make sure he is being provided quality care and to be his advocate. Not all assisted living facilities are equal. Some are amazing and compassionate, while others are focused on profits at the expense of the people who live there. If you DO decide to take your father in again, there are extremely helpful caregiver support groups where you learn to care for yourself first and are connected with others who have been in similar situations and can share their experiences. I also recommend taking advantage of respite services where you could have in home caregivers or have a set up where your father spends a few days to a week every month or so in an assisted living in order for you and your husband to take a break from being the primary caregivers. I am not sure if this is provided in all states, but I live in a Midwestern state where this is quite common. I wish you the best of luck in whichever decision you make!", "op=NTA\n\nbut if you can spare the money, maybe make him a monthly allowance so he has a bit on top of what his costs are.", "NTA.  Also, there is a /caregivers sub here you might find helpful for general support and resources.

He\u2019s not going to use it. The only reason he wants to save money is so that he can give it to you and his other children and grandchildren. Reassure him that you\u2019re going to be okay without his money, that he should spend it getting excellent care and that you\u2019d rather have him on this earth for longer living in the facility than have his money without him.", "NTA unfortunately he needs the care and you know how intensive it can be maybe offer to send him a little $ of you have extra so he can have a little more spending money.", "NTA.

He really needs help if he gets sick again which is always the case.  My late mom in law moved into AL after living alone for years and years after her husband passed away.  Her sons (one of them is my late husband) used to rush to her home if the phone  (her daughter called from other state) isn't answered, sure enough she passed out and was rushed to ER, etc. several times. So she relented and moved to AL.  She was much happier and more active until health issues overtook her that she ended up in a nursing home for a couple of months before her death at age of 90 or 91.  So we all felt peace when she moved into AL.  So rest assured that you won't feel guilty when you told him no and stay in AL that he really needs the most.

Additionally, he's getting the care he needs there.  You can't give him that same level of care.  Also, what if he leaves and his health declines again?  You can't guarantee that facility will still have a spot for him.  He might end up somewhere else with far fewer amenities at a far higher cost.\n\nI went through something similar with my in-laws.  I don't want to get into details but it was an unmitigated disaster.", "Absolutely NTA. He could never get all the services that place provides for what he's paying now, so complaining about the price is nonsense.

The toll can be physical, emotional, and even financial at times. At his age, he needs a higher level of care and the ALF is the best placement for him at this time. He sure needs frequent visitations for sure and phone calls will also cheer him up. You\u2019ve done your part already, you have to  take care of those aging bones of yours too. \ud83d\ude05", "No you are not the a****** you were an are a good daughter. He's fine right where he's at he just doesn't know it. Go on with your life but let your father stay where he's at he'll be okay", "NTA I have been taking care of my Mom for over 8 years and \\*I have care giver burnout.", "NAH\n\nHere's a way to guide the conversation without taking away his autonomy. \n\n\"Yknow, Dad, I've been so proud of all the progress you're making here. I really believe that it's because you're so much closer to most of our entire family - and because you don't have to worry about bills and mortgage and stuff. There's something about how you seem to feel better when you're right here with everyone and you're not having to worry about how we're going to get bills paid. I think you should give this place more of a chance. \n\nSee, I usually have less pocket money, too, at the end of the month, but it's okay 'cause everything's paid - just like it is here, for you, Dad. I think this place has been *great* for you, but what do you think? What do you like about it?\"\n\nGet him to tell you what he likes about where he is, then what he doesn't like. See if you can work with him and the staff to come up with some tweaks that'll make it work for him.  He trusts you, which may be part of why he wants to move back with you. Let him know he can trust you to advocate for him, even when he doesn't see you as often. \n\nAfter your convo, set a three-month trial period, but don't ask about it during regular check-ins. If he brings it up, just remind him about the trial period (unless it's something needing your immediate attention). Repeat the process, quarterly - same convo and negotiating. Keep doing that, and he may come around on his own, sooner than you think.\n\nAnd tell the staff to tell him every time you call them to check on him (every week). \n\nAlways ask about the positives, first, to give you ideas on how to negotiate the negatives.\n\nIf he says he doesn't want to give it a chance, then just let him know that you'll have to explore other alternatives with him, because navigating his healthcare needs is a big job and you're just not sure you're strong enough to do it. Then, give him the three-month trial period option. Autonomy is always limited by the options we have.", "OP, this is the comment that you should be listening to - it's *safer*. \n\nYour dad is getting stronger because he has the appropriate care. He's not falling or getting hurt. He has access to professionals.\n\nIt's like that anecdote about the person who used dandruff shampoo years and didn't have flakes. As soon as they stopped the shampoo, the flakes came back. \n\nI'm can almost guarantee that your father's health would decline if he moved back in with you, which is no judgement on you or your husband. But you guys aren't paid professionals in shifts who can go home and decompress after eight hours.\n\nLeave it to the professionals", "Often I find it's simply a case of \"Well, I'm better now. Time to go back to my old way of living\". But the human brain doesn't recognise that you're better off because of where you are, and that your routine has changed by being there. Unfortunately you need to stay where you are to maintain that growth/progress.\n\nSame principle often works with diets and addiction.", "Eh as a general rule, I feel like it\u2019s a bad call to make choices for other people about what\u2019s best for them. (That\u2019s how you end up with Christian\u2019s trying to ban gay marriage because they think forcing gay people to be straight is what\u2019s best for them.) \n\nThe reality of the situation is that OP\u2019s dad is very well taken care of where he is now, and not having him live with them is *better for OP and her husband.* If the dad were in a terrible living situation, prioritizing her own needs would be selfish. But he\u2019s not. He\u2019s doing great. So she\u2019s allowed to feel ok about doing great herself and making the choice that\u2019s best for her, even if it\u2019s not what her dad would prefer. \n\nChoosing to keep him where he is \u201cbecause he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s best for him\u201d is super patronizing and condescending. Choosing to keep him where he is because he\u2019s made measurable progress and because it\u2019s better for her and her husband is reality. Dad\u2019s a grownup. I believe she can trust him that he wants what\u2019s best for OP as much as she wants what\u2019s best for him.", "She shouldn't lie to her dad. That will make him think she only cares about his money and that would be heart breaking. She could say what she said in this post, ie, they want to be able to travel, rest, be a couple and not just care givers. Seems mean to make up a lie that's crueler than the truth. He may not like the truth either, but that's life.", "He doesn\u2019t want what\u2019s best for her. He wants her to be his caregiver.", "Well it's even more complicated. We build and land use and transportation planning paradigm that is 100% ableist. It's not designed for people who can't take care of themselves. It was a product of the postwar period when the US was wealthy and other countries weren't. As people age and they can't drive or are physically disabled in some way, it is impossible.\n\nWe moved in with ILs because FIL had dementia and 80s+ MIL could no longer take care of him by herself.", "That\u2019s my plan.", "NTA just repeat no and no further explanation", "My Dad moved in with us when he couldn\u2019t take care of himself anymore.

NTA, you did your share", "He is in the best place to be. All of his needs are taken care of and you said that health wise, he is in much better shape. Being a caregiver is a tiring and thankless job. You and your husband did it for five years. It will be much more difficult when your father has another set back. The two of you need to take care of each other. NTA", "NTA. If all his needs are being met, what does he even use the other half of his monthly income for? Not to be bleak, but it\u2019s not like he has any big trips to save up for or extreme purchases\u2026if he\u2019s getting great care, his quality of life has improved, and he\u2019s surrounded by loved ones, I feel like half his income is a fair price for that exchange..?", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA.  It is a tough situation, but you have good reasons and a right to make your decision. Please don't feel guilty.", "NTA\n\nI wish I could tell you that he will understand, but he probably won't.  I'd say the best you can do is reinforce the idea that he is closer to family where he is and he is doing better because of his community there.  But he still probably won't agree.", "NTA.  And  part of why he is doing so well is because he is in a therapeutic environment.  There's a not small chance that he would decline again once he is without the assistance he can access there.", "Even if he is better now, the reason he is doing better is the specialized attention he gets.  And, it is temporary.  He is 87, other things will go wrong and next time you might not be able to get him into such a nice place.", "Nah. No is a full sentence. His quality of life and yours is better now. No need to back track.", "NTA, but if you can float him some monthly spending money, you may find it\u2019s worth it.", "NTA. He is doing well because of where he is.", "100% NTA!", "NTA. OP, just be honest with him that you think him being there is better for everyone, that you love him, but you're never going to go back to the previous arrangement.", "Yes. My mum moved in with us after my dad died. Mum had dementia.   \n\n\nOn the last day of the build of the MIL suite, my husband had a stroke.  Even prior to that, organising hospital procedures for myself was a nightmare. (I'm an only child and was working full time and helping both my parents a great deal.) Also made couple time and holidays very difficult.", "I'm in my 60s. I have  permanent shoulder and back trouble because of caring. I don't regret being a carer, but it definitely takes a physical toll.", "This is really insightful. Thanks!", "All the more reason for her to stand up for herself and tell him what she wants.", "FWIW, I work at a good assisted living residence, and the services you mention are vital to keeping your father in reasonable condition, especially the socializing with other residents and the professional-level help he gets from the staff.  (Just the social impetus to get himself dressed and travel to the dining room to kibitz with his buddies is a big deal.)  \n\n\nThere's a boundary when being the child of a old person means that you have to make decisions for them, as though they were your children, in their best interests.  That your father has thrived in this residence is good evidence that it is the right thing for him.", "He\u2019s okay where he is. His needs are met. Now concentrate on yours. NTA", "NTA...it's best he stay where he is so he can continue to receive the care and stability he needs.  When a person moves from these facilities they begin to \"backslide\" and they become dependent again.", "NTA. If he gets worse again or starts having problems you\u2019ll have to start bringing in a nurse/caretaker which are very expensive. Plus the energy involved in the extra cleaning and worry that he might fall, etc.\n\nIf money is his main concern, I would tell him you and your spouse can\u2019t keep up with the physical demands anymore and would need to hire help which might cost as much as the living facility would anyway.\n\nAlternately if he\u2019s struggling financially, you could offer to help pay for part of the facility fee he\u2019s in (only IF this is feasible of course).", "There are so many comments here saying that your father is better off where he is. THAT'S NOT THE POINT! It may or may not be true. The facts available to us are: firstly, that he wants to live with you (presumably because he likes living with you); and secondly, that you don't want him there because he's such a burden. THIS is what you have to address.\n\nYou are definitely NTA for not wanting to spend the rest of his life waiting on him hand and foot. By all means refuse to take him back. But don't use the flimsy excuse that it's in his best interests.", "NTA you did very well by your father already. Instead of you shouldering this burden by yourself you need to have a family meeting along with a social worker & his physician on my his being in assisted living is more beneficial mentally & physically. Have you addressed with him the financial aspects? If all his needs are being met & paid for what are his financial concerns?It is time your family comes together and communicates. Good luck.", "NTA.

The cost is nearly his entire monthly income.*\n\nSounds like he's getting a great deal for it, too.  What is it he wants to buy that he's lacking, at present?  \nYou're NTA.  Caregiving can wreck you.  He's in a good place, there's no need to sacrifice yourselves.", "Absolutely NTA but you have a hard conversation coming your way. :(", "NTA, there is a reason that caretaking is a Paid job.  If it was easy no one would be paying for it.  It burns you out even when you're dealing with it on a minor level.  The harder someone is to care for the worse it gets.  You deserve to live your life.", "When my grandmother moved in with my parents she forfeited her entire social security check to them.\n\nI'm not sure why you're providing all these services to him when he stays with you for free. If he pays for them where he is, he pays for them with you.\n\nNo idea how you got roped into any of this without monetary compensation.", "NTA. You and your husband cannot provide the full care he might need should he have another fall, plus as you said he is now closer to other family and friends. \n\nPlus it sounds like he is being *thrifty* since his assisted living costs more than your house. You should point out that you do not have unlimited funds either and would need him to pay for more than just some groceries.", "Sincere thanks to all who replied. I suppose what I\u2019m really worried about is that my father will not accept no for an answer unless it\u2019s delivered with a verbal sledgehammer. No matter how much I tell him he\u2019s better where he is, he wants to come home. I\u2019ve tried telling him we can\u2019t provide adequate care, and he says he doesn\u2019t need much and he\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve told him taking care of him is too much for us, and he insists that he\u2019s not that much trouble. \n\nUnfortunately my father is a perfect storm of demanding, entitled, and oblivious. I\u2019m afraid the only way it will get through to him is a direct, \u201cYou can\u2019t live here anymore because we don\u2019t want you here.\u201d  I am not looking forward to that. \n\nI suppose I just needed to send up a test balloon to make sure I was not a BaD dAuGhTeR. \n\nThank you to everyone who took time out of their day to comment. I appreciate you all.", "NTA! You shouldn\u2019t be expected to take your father in, especially since it\u2019s physically difficult for you & your husband.  Other family members could step up & take him, but it sounds like his current situation truly is the best solution.", "It\u2019s strange how we as a society have gotten so invested in leaving our kids an inheritance instead of using the money we save for retirement FOR RETIREMENT.

I don\u2019t know exactly what OP\u2019s dad wants to save for but at 87 it\u2019s very possible he could die at any time so there\u2019s no real reason to save if his income covers his AL.", "It's not flimsy.

That generation has 'save' for the future so ingrained into them that it might not even be a conscious thing he's intentionally saving for or recognizing where the cost is going. He might not even have an answer to the what are you saving for question. If op helps him to find acceptance for his money being used in a helpful way that could go a long way.", "I have a lot of health issues to the extent I'm seriously contemplating applying for part time assistance now and my intent is to go into an AL home the moment I need it in old age rather than burden my child with my care.", "Yep I'm mobility impaired and shopping for a home was so difficult. Find wheelchair accessible homes or even homes that could easily be converted is almost impossible. I ended up getting a condo as a result because it was easier to find one that met my needs."]}
