Trying to demand you make something for him? How entitled.", "I do not know where you live, OP, but in my area, the opportunity for purchasing fresh pie cherries (sour cherries, which are NOT the same cherries you buy to eat) is extremely limited, and happens in June. Ask him where he thinks he's going to get *FRESH PIE CHERRIES* in November.", "I just came here to say not all men are lazy bums like your husband. I do all the cooking at our house", "NTA.  Keep a watch out for your new husband. If he's going to get that butthurt over something so petty, he'll get even more butthurt and angry over other stuff.", "NTA. How about your husband makes himself a cherry pie?", "Relationships are about give and take. If I were in your shoes I would have said \"sure honey, as long as you help me prep\". Then again I'd expect the same of my partner, don't know your relationship dynamics so its hard to judge this one.", "NTA, good Op I understand your side because it's a pie that demands more work but I understand your husband's side kind of and jealousy basically and yes him acting like that demanding is wrong but you should talk about it later to solve but I wouldn't judge him as wrong if he started refusing to do things to please you after this happened", "NAH\n\nYour reason for not making the cherry pie is sound, but he is allowed to ask questions, make requests, and feel butthurt when his request is denied. There is no AH here.", "Ask? You mean Google. The man can figure it out himself.", "I\u2019m with you on the NTA 100%. But in case you want \u201cfresh\u201d cherry pie ever, frozen cherries work awesome in it. I found this out because I am very lazy and wouldn\u2019t dream of pitting all the cherries I would need to make a pie, but my mom really wanted cherry pie and can\u2019t have the canned filling.", "'Cherry pie one of the most labor intensive homemade pies' are you serious ?! Wouaw", "no one said it's about him asking for pie but for him being mad over her saying no. Another pie is extra work hat could be easily done another day when she has time for it. If he feels not appreciated he can talk about it and they find a solution together. Fact is we dont know how much they do for each other and if it is out of balance then whatever he's doing wont solve it.", "Because she didn't ask for one?", "And doesn't realize that the amazing pies that he thinks use fresh cherries is also using canned filling", "Sour pie cherries are fresh in season for about\u2026.45 minutes a year. If you\u2019re using sour cherries outside of July they\u2019re frozen. And they\u2019re perfectly suitable.", "Have you made a homemade from scratch cherry pie? He requested no canned cherries or store bought crust. If it\u2019s so easy, go make one then :)", "I'm just chock to see people making drama over a husband who love his wife (of 5months) baking and ask for a pie! She obviously love baking and she is good at it so he wanted to feel special like her dad, don't need a master in psychology to understand that! They make a huge thing over something that small and respond like he abused her! It's scary", "Yeah, I would never think a pie had actually fresh cherries.", "I'm a baker but thank for asking! You making me laugh so much!!", "He can feel special another day? It\u2019s not his birthday\u2026.", "I read the top comments and I didnt see anything about abuse. What about his love for her? he doesnt respect her reasoning and her saying no. Part of loving someone is also respecting when they dont have time or have other reasons. And again, it's about him asking for a pie but his reaction to a no and a reasonable explenation as to why.", "Lmao", "Cool! So are you disagreeing with me that totally from scratch cherry pie is not more labor intensive than peach pie? I have baked both and that\u2019s definitely my opinion.", "So for you it need a special day to feel special? It's sad to think like that I kind enjoy everyday like a special day!! It make life less boring and more funny /enjoyable but that's my opinion!", "I think people should be more intelligent in the way they interact with their partner ,rather just saying no why not saying 'for thanksgiving I will do that pie but if you are kind enough during the evening I will maybe prepare just for you a special pie this week and we will enjoy the night together'! It's avoid every not necessary argument and make them have a funny moment together but no! People are in the extreme all the time and it's exhausting!!", "I never say that, I didn't agree over the fact that cherry pie is the most labor intensive pie to do!! Thats's all so don't put your words on me!!", "And why shouldnt he be more intelligent? why doesnt he for himself realise that another cake is double the work? He acts butthurt even tho she gave him reasons as to why not. It has nothing to do with him not being special enough yet he seems to take it that way. And considering he knows how the pie tastes and she recognises it as his favorite I bet she has made him that cake on more than one occasion.", "You know what you are right happy! I don't want to argue anymore over this, you have your idea I have mine and right now it's a waste of time! Have a good day/evening!", "Summary:\n\u201cI\u2019m making something as an act of love for my dad.\u201d\nHusband \u201cWELL YOU BETTER NOT LOVE HIM MORE MAKE ME A PIE AND PROVE IT!\u201d\n\nNTA. Your husband is insecure and demanding, and as everyone has pointed out you can only buy frozen sour cherries for pie right now anyway, but make him wait til the 3 days sour cherries are in season, then make him stem, pit, and cut them all and see how much he likes it.", "Straight up ask him why he\u2019s trying to compete with your dad lol", "NTA. Also, cherries aren\u2019t in season. Would OP even be able to find them?", "Yta and I can see this marriage is never going to work long term.", "NTA, but am I the only person thinking that if her only concern is upstaging the aunt, OP could make it but keep it at home just for her and hubby? It would be a sweet (pun intended) thing to do.", "NAH - And wow - all the people calling the husband the AH....\n\nI'm sorry, but we do nice things for our spouses. If she doesn't want to do it, then that's okay. That's her decision. But, that doesn't make the husband the AH. Not at all.\n\nAnd how about the million things the husband has probably done for her, when he really didn't feel like it? But, everyone claims he is TA?\n\nWow.", "NAH. That said... Make the guy a damn cherry pie to eat at home, so he doesn't have to share. Doing nice things for SO keeps the marriage healthy.", "NTA", "NTA, he\u2019s being a child about it. His favorite pie will be there, who cares if it\u2019s \u201cnot fresh\u201d.", "Feels like DH feels the need to compete with daddy.\n\nNta", "NTA, the way he approached this was deeply entitled and rude. He\u2019s not owed anything just because he\u2019s married to you. Baking is labor intensive, especially from scratch. Maybe if he asked nicely, you might\u2019ve been more inclined to compromise and offer to make him a pie later, but he ruined that by acting entitled. \n\nHas he ever helped you make a pie? Does he know how much goes into it? Has he offered to help or clean up? Why does he think he \u201cdeserves\u201d a pie?", "NTA. He also didn\u2019t even ask but demanded which is rude and leaves a bad taste in my mouth", "NTA. This reminds me of those questions: \u201cif your man and your dad get into a fight\u2026your man says go to the car and your dad says sit down, who do you listen to?

There are no good sour cherries available fresh to make a cherry pie with. He can wait till next summer, like the rest of us.\n\nAlso, what is this one for me, one for you silliness? \n\nDo you also have to buy him a present every time you get one for a family member? \n\nDo you owe him an hour of chauffered driving every time you pick someone else up from the airport?", "Um, unless it\u2019s a real hardship, can\u2019t OP compromise and tell husband she\u2019ll make one they can eat at home?

Give him a recipe and cherry pitter for Christmas, and bake a homemade cherry pie for his birthday.", "YTA Yeah i dont care what anyone in this thread said. But if my wife asked me to do skmething simple for her i would do it. Damn well befpre i did the same thing before anyone else even my parents. you shouldn't be married.", "YTA you should tell him you'll make him one but not for Thanksgiving because the Aunt or whoever will already have one.

I feel like that would be a descent compromise", "ESH. You're already bringing a peach pie which is in fact a fruit, making the excuse irrelevant. Not sure why you'd claim that's the case when you're already breaking that tradition. You're already Also making a pie, it's not much more work to make another.\n\nYour husband shouldn't just assume your aunt's pies will be \"canned\" or in any other way worse than yours, especially if she brings them every year. Also it's pie. It's not hard to make even if they're fresh cherries. Have him do it himself.", "What's your husband's love language? If it's acts of service then you have a problem on your hands. \"Do you even love him?\" might be a question that comes to his mind. \n\nNTA but just little bit inconsiderate considering making one more won't be that much of an inconvenience. Just my 2 cents.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to make him one, but could you just make him one for at home for you guys and not take it to Thanksgiving?", "Nta but your husband gonna give you a cream pie", "NTA, but only mildly.\n\nOk so why not fix your hubby a fresh cherry pie LIKE - NOW, so he can enjoy it and then he can pick at your Aunt's frozen / canned filling pie on thanksgiving. Absolute win! He get his pie, you don't upstage your Aunt.", "Cake? You didn't even read the fucking post", "You're such a menace \ud83e\udd23", "No one said he can\u2019t have a cherry pie.
