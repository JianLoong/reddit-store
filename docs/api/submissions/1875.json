We have names for different pies and cakes so you would either say you had cake or you would say I had cheese cake, apple pie, brownies or whatever you specifically had.", "You're still acting like I have absolved the husband of his actions and that's clearly not the case.\n\nI will not \"read the room\". I'm not going to change my judgment and long held beliefs for a couple hundred fake internet points on the whim of strangers.\n\nSince you're so interested in other people's baking skills, I'm sure you'd also be willing to help OP out. By all means, please show us all how mystically difficult this cherry pie is.", "\u2620\ufe0f", "yikes i never asked you to change ur decision. i simply asked you to make him a delicious pie that u said you very well make. iam not a baker but i know making freshly baked pies aren't easy. i also know asking your spouse to make something out of love and asking them since she's already making a pie why not make him one is different. but you are a great one, isn't it? i ain't interested in your cooking skills. u were the one that chose to tell me. its easy! have a great day.", "Wow, people are going and over-imagining and stretching alot for this post. I think that there are NAH. From the post alone it sounds like OP is making her dads favorite pie from scratch and when husband found out about OP going the extra mile asked if she could make a pie for him as well. OP just explains why and says no and her husband feels hurt. IMO there isn't any AH moment here. OP is allowed to say no and husband is allowed to feel hurt by having his request denied.", "YTA. You new husband asked you to bake him a pie. It didn't matter to you that you are not in charge of fruit pies when you said you were baking one for your dad, so why not bake one for your husband?", "NTA", "Cherry pie from fresh cherries is a pita. I wouldn\u2019t make one either. That is a ton of work. I do make apple for my boyfriend. It is his favorite, but apples are easier to deal with than cherries.", "Do not i repeat do not give in to him.  From 20 years of experience he will expect you to cater to him always if you bake him that pie", "NTA, but I think it'd be a nice gesture (if you want to) to offer to make it for another occasion so that your aunt doesn't feel upstaged.", "Cherry pie would be nice surprise for after thanksgiving or Christmas", "NTA Fresh cherry pie is ridiculously time consuming because you have to pit all the cherries, where peach pie is pretty quick. If he wants fresh cherry pie, then maybe he should learn how to make them. Or at least offer to pit all those cherries.", "But Peach is also a fruit is it not? That's really all I'm focused on here.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your reason for not making a cherry pie for Thanksgiving is a wise choice.", "NAH\u2026 Sometimes it\u2019s just nice to do something for the ones we love. All he wants is a pie\u2026. Make the pie.  #Veryhappilymarriedfor28years.", "NTA if her wants a pie, he has (I assume) 2 hands. His favorite will be there and his little hissy fit isn't worth upsetting someone on a holiday.", "NTA\u2026and laughing at your husband for being jealous of his FIL", "Kinda-YTA, do you even like your husband? Why not ask your aunt if you could bring the cherry pie this year? Maybe he should do something super sweet for Christmas for his mom and tell you he doesn\u2019t owe you any favors", "NAH...to me.  BUT maybe your husband doesn't understand the work to make a pie.  And why are pies only for Thanksgiving?  I understand and fully appreciate your reasons for not making one for Thanksgiving...but couldn't the two of you make a cherry pie together before then?  People need to stop making things so damn hard! Edited to add...but school  your husband not to tell your Aunt you did so and that he LOVES her cherry pie...wink wink", "Yeah I was thinking the same thing. It has to be from frozen or a can at this time of year unless they are like in Chile or New Zealand.", "Omg I love it", " \ud83d\udc9a", "Yep sure is.  Basically you have to make one and then get the other one ready while the first one is baking.  Takes almost twice as long.  I'm in charge of pies and have been for years.  It literally takes me half the night to make pies.", "My mom's current property had one huge old cherry tree... it had to come down this year, it was already old and only my Mom's magical green thumb kept it alive, but it never recovered after a particularly nasty winter storm.  Still have three jars of jam to remember it by.  Mom is replacing it with another cherry sapling, but it will take a while for the new tree to bear fruit.  When I was little, we had a big garden (or, I suppose, a small suburban farm) and I think we had 8 or 10 cherry shrubs (in the frozen north, trees don't do well, but smaller varietal survived all but the most brutal winters with proper care).  Lots of other berries too... my favorite jam is and has always been raspberry.", "NTA and your husband is being a fucking weirdo.", "NTA, but preferably if you explain why (that it's hard to make rather than you're not entitled to make it or something like that) so that he understands and no arguments will be produced :) a happy marriage is indeed a jolly anyway!", "Honestly I can see why he would be a little hurt. You are basically saying he\u2019s not a priority but your father is.", "NTA but i'm thinking you could maybe surprise him with his favorite pie before thanksgiving. Just for him, might turn a crappy situation into a nice one.", "NTA. But also am curious about the context of the \u201cyou gotta make my favorite\u201d. To me it reads like more of an excited suggestion with some *wink wink* energy than an actual demand.", "NTA. You couldn\u2019t PAY me to pit all those cherries. What a brat!", "NTA. Your husband can make his own cherry pie if he wants one so bad.", "NTA. \n\nOrrrrr, you could agree to make the pie if he pits the cherries.\n\nEdited: spelling", "Back in the summer when sweet cherries were on sale, I stemmed, pitted and froze a couple pounds. Even with a pitter device, it was one of the most fiddly, messy, sticky, slow going things ever. Delicious, but not something I'd enjoy doing for someone who is so demanding as OP's spouse.", "Hopping on the top comment to say that It's Not About The Cherry Pie.  It's about the fact her father gets a fresh pie and OP's husband wants to know he is an important man in her life and also worthy of a fresh pie.", "I\u2019m sorry, where did he ask? He demanded. Furthermore, peach is one of the fruit pies he aunt isn\u2019t making. You need to use those reading comprehension skills because you\u2019re making a lot of assumptions and supplementing facts that simply aren\u2019t there.\n\nEven if her aunt weren\u2019t in the picture, it\u2019s rude to double someone\u2019s burden, especially when he didn\u2019t offer to help at all. He\u2019s approaching this from the standpoint that if she\u2019s making one for family, he\u2019s owed one as well. That is very entitled and rude behavior. If he said, \u201cWould you mind doubling the crust recipe and I\u2019ll be happy to make the filling for a cherry pie!\u201d That\u2019s a different set of circumstances, and would be a nice thing to do. She\u2019s not obligated to bake for every man in her life on every occasion. He has hands.", "Ours trees are usually stripped by starlings, but last year we got a bumper crop. Husband and I sat on the porch pitting cherries and listening to book tapes for hours. Got enough pitted cherries for 20 pies. It's so lovely to pull a container out and plop them into a crust while the oven preheats. \n\nNow I want pie!", "I bet you it's not about the cherry pie.  It is about the fact you are baking a pie for another man (your father) and your husband wants to know that you consider him important enough also to bake him a pie.\n\nStrong marriages are founded on couples who show each other love through their actions and deeds.  My first one ended because we did not do this enough.  Think about how your husband shows his love to you, and how you can show it to him.  And of course, don't be afraid to express your needs!", "When he huffs and puffs and insists on a pie because OP's dad got one? Yes. If he wants a pie with no canned filling, he can pit the cherries himself. Let's see if he still wants pie after the first dozen or so cherries.", "Frozen cherries are also pitted already! Score for that.\n\nAlso like, OP's husband didn't even ask nicely with a \"please\"?!! He basically DEMANDED a cherry pie. I hate this guy already."]}
