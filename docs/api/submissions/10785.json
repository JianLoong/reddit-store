The pact where you take care of them because they took care of you didn't happen. They didn't raise you or pay your education. I'm less sure how it works if they sent you to grandmother and she paid for everything. Was it with an expectation that you take care of her son and other grandkids? Because your dad disowned you so technically I think you would be cool there too. \n\nObviously in America, you are in the clear but I want you to not feel guilty about this period. Is it normal for the oldest to go to the grandparents in your other culture? I understand your aunt took care of all of her siblings but all of you are in America, it's way more difficult to pay for 7+ people in America.", "NTA, your family sounds needy.

But of course her money goes along way with the US dollar conversion.", "I\u2019m actually questioning myself the same too. The only reason I made peace with my parents before, is so I could build a relationship with my siblings. But now I\u2019m noticing that if I don\u2019t reach out first, I would literally not hear from them. Same with my parents, it\u2019s like they have this weird silent rule that me as a child should call them. They literally don\u2019t call me.

Asking for a truck is too. Even if did owe them something (which I don't think you do) those aren't reasonable requests.", "Then you fulfilled your social contract. \n\nI was wondering if it was a they were too young or irresponsible thing.

So my mom received a lot of backlash from it. I\u2019m sure she suffered a lot of emotional trauma from it. From what I know, she was the golden child and the only one they invested to go to college in hopes of her being able to help everyone out after.. but she ended up pregnant with me.\n\n\u2014 I was showing my anger from being left for so many years. I was not listening to them and talked back, which my dad found disrespectful. So my dad disowned me since he didn\u2019t want my siblings to see that and copy it.", "That's unfortunate. I try to support the one of us rises, we all rise, way of life but it's just not always feasible. I think you need to disengage because they're always going to feel like you owe them for that. Good luck. \n\nI think that makes your dad look worse.  That's kicking you out of the family for his own mistakes.
