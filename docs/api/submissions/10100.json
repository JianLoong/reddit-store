We weren\u2019t gonna attend the wedding because we could not afford it, his family insisted we come because \u201cshe couldn\u2019t get married without her son\u201d. MIL\u2019s sister \u201csurprised\u201d us with plane tickets. At first we were happy about it but the closer we got to the date the more stressed out I got because we could not afford this trip even with the tickets paid for. \n\nOne of the things we were going to do was have a 3 course meal at a restaurant post wedding, MIL said not too worry, she would pay and we could pay her back later. We went and it was hell traveling with a toddler, the tickets were cheap we had to run to catch the next plane, only after purchased they said \u201coh sorry about the connecting time, we just noticed\u201d. \n\nWe get there and the wedding is rushed but beautiful, come the restaurant and I\u2019m looking at the prices and I feel extremely bad that the bride and groom have to pay for us but we still order and eat and have as good of a time with a 3-year old stuck to a chair for several hours. Later in the cabin and the bride is splashed out on the couch and she looks sick so I ask if she\u2019s feeling sick she has the audacity to turn to me and say \u201cit\u2019s covid\u201d and I was shocked I asked \u201chow do you know? Did you take a test?\u201d And she goes \u201cwe\u2019ve both had it since we left England\u201d EXCUSE ME? \n\nIt\u2019s a literal destination wedding, we had nowhere to go, we were all cramped up in the cabin and what do you know me and my son got covid and it was the most horrible I\u2019ve felt being sick wise. We had to fly home and we did so with masks and hand sanitizer and I felt so guilty for having covid and still flying I didn\u2019t breathe in certain situations. We get home and I\u2019m feeling so horrible that I texted MIL saying it was really irresponsible of her to still have the wedding and risk infecting everyone just for the sake of marriage (they have been together for years, they would\u2019ve been able to wait longer) and granted I was not the best at texting because at this point I was livid and so sick so I was cursing but she replied with \u201cyou rude bitch, have your 2 day flu and shut up about it like everyone else\u201d sorry what? 2 day flu? I had it for weeks and I legit had to shove my fingers in my throat to pull out snot that was stuck and I couldn\u2019t breathe. Thankfully my son was only ill for a week or so and he was fine again. \n\nFast forward to a couple months later and she\u2019s wondering where the money is. And like I have said to my partner that had she had the decency to tell us we wouldn\u2019t even have gone to Norway or to the restaurant to eat after the wedding. We already spent hundreds on clothes, food AND medicine because covid etc and she\u2019s upset about the restaurant? We didn\u2019t want to go, simple as that. The tickets were forced on us.

If you are sick and fly knowingly, it\u2019s a dick move.", ">I consulted several people and they said we should mask up and still travel.\n\nWas one of them the MIL? If you are sick, Stay. Away. From. Other. People.", "Were any of those people doctors? Or better yet, public health experts?", "This is not cool. The air in a plane gets recycled, which means that everything you breathed out was spread through the plane - including to people in poor health. ESH.", "You still prioritized yourself over everyone else on that plane, just like MIL prioritized her wedding. \n\nYeah, you got screwed and that sucks. But you just exposed a plane load of people and everyone they live with to Covid.", "Did you contact the local public health line and ask what they wanted you to do? They often help people find a way to isolate locally in order to avoid exactly the problem of being forced to travel while infectious.", "Ahh gotcha. Sorry, got muddled there. In that case I think focus on my second point - do you honestly want to accept money off this person? Personally I'd pay her the money and write her off. And I'll be honest, my judgement is more about the fact that you flew home knowing it put others at risk.", "MIL sounds like a piece of work. Her response via text was RIDICULOUS!! \u201cShut up like everyone else\u201d... JFC how many people got sick?!?! Sorry that happened. I know you\u2019re getting bashed for flying. Obviously, wasn\u2019t the best plan but no one ever expects their family to willingly spread the germs & lie about it. Ugh!!! Glad you & your son are on the mend & feeling better. MIL is the real AH here!", "Am I the only one wondering why the newly married couple was requiring their invited guests to pay for their meals after the wedding (basically, the reception)? If they had had it catered at a venue, would you have had to pay then, too? \n\nVery soft YTA for traveling home once you knew you had COVID. However, I well remember the days when my now ex and I couldn\u2019t afford any \u201cextras,\u201d and the stress that caused. I specifically remember a time that we were expected to show up at my ex\u2019s father\u2019s birthday party in a city far from us. We were only given a few weeks notice, and I had to rearrange my work schedule. The flights and hotel room were taken care of, but I was stressed about the other things I knew we\u2019d have to pay for (meals, snacks, incidentals, etc). That\u2019s how broke we were at the time. But we still went even though I had to drop a few shifts at work. Looking back, I shouldn\u2019t have. But my ex FIL\u2019s wife was always quick with criticism, and I didn\u2019t want to give her anything she would consider ammunition. \n\nGuess what? It still wasn\u2019t good enough. I was criticized for taking photos of family (even though they posed for them) and for not bringing our kids with us. Ex FIL\u2019s wife didn\u2019t care they would\u2019ve had to miss at least 2 days of school, sports practice, and games. That was not good enough for her. \n\nI should\u2019ve just told my then husband to go to his dad\u2019s party by himself, and I\u2019d take care of the kids. I hate to tell you, but that\u2019s probably what you should\u2019ve done. But that\u2019s easy for me to say after almost 3 decades of dealing with my in-laws. \n\nI also understand that you had no good choices regarding getting home while having COVID. It would be easy for me to say you should\u2019ve waited it out in a hotel, but I know that there was a good chunk of my married life where I didn\u2019t know if my grocery charge would go through on my card, let alone days of hotel charges and food. Add onto to that last minute plane tickets for 3. \n\nI think you did the best you could under the circumstances, and I hope you and your child are feeling better. \n\nThe difference between you and your MIL regarding COVID is that she was nonchalant and frankly uncaring if her guests (including her son and his young family) got COVID from her. You are still stressing out about possibly exposing others to the virus. You took the precautions you could in the situation. \n\nGood luck to you. I\u2019d go NC or VERY LC with this woman.\n\nETA regarding paying for your meals after the wedding. I would inform her that after the extra expenses incurred due to her KNOWINGLY exposing you to COVID and the last minute information regarding the expensive restaurant which was her (the bride\u2019s) choice, you will not be paying her anything due to her choices.", "So... he's leaving you to deal with his mother? If this is typical of her behavior I'd have a really big issue with that.", "I hate to tell you this, but by not \u201ctaking a side,\u201d he actually is. This is his mother. He should be the one dealing with her and supporting you and child regarding getting COVID from his mother. \n\nDid she kiss her grandchild, knowing she was probably giving him COVID? Did she hug him? Did she have him sit next to her or on her lap? Did she share food with him? \n\nYour partner cannot \u201cnot take sides.\u201d He must. This is about his family\u2019s health, physical and financial.", "First, no army forced her on the plane. The could have stayed home if she couldn\u2019t afford to travel. If you can\u2019t afford a couple extra nights in case of emergency, you can\u2019t afford to travel. Remember Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull?\nSecond. Norway is a very developed country. She didn\u2019t try contacting any authorities to find out what het options were.", "Contact your embassy and ask. Contact the local government and ask. Contact the airline and ask.", "If the alternative is roaming around the streets of Norway, homeless, with a 3 year old, with no way back home even after they get better, then yeah, OP did the only thing she could have and I don't blame her even a bit. It's easy for you to say shit like that when you're not the one in that situation.", "I worked through the absolute worst of the pandemic and took public transportation every day. I worked around plenty of sick people (education)\n\nI didn't get COVID till people started taking their masks off. Masking and distancing actually does work. They were stuck in a bad situation and did the best they could.", "I don\u2019t understand how else we could have avoided it. I asked the people that would be able to help us stay there longer which they couldn\u2019t so we did the next best thing since everybody was leaving the cabin the same day we flew home.", "So they can't afford to stay in Finland until they get well, and can't afford to get home except on the original tickets. Do they just apply for residency and make a new life in Finland, or just kill themselves in the absence of other options?", "It\u2019s actually the opposite.  The air on airplane is consistently filtered into a HEPA filter (sometimes multiple times a minute).", "This is not true. Airplane air is remarkably safe. The high air flow rate combined with the HEPA filters makes the air clean and the risk of transferring covid to other passengers low. \n\n[https://www.iata.org/en/youandiata/travelers/health/low-risk-transmission/](https://www.iata.org/en/youandiata/travelers/health/low-risk-transmission/)", "Please explain, in detail, how you expected them to stay?

Honestly it\u2019s clear as fckin day that you\u2019ve lost someone close to covid & you\u2019re projecting because you\u2019ve replied to every single covid response OP\u2019s given being extremely defensive.

If you\u2019ve never had an overbearing family (in law or not) it is a massive manipulation. Op made a boundary and they forced them to come then gave them covid in a foreign country where they had nowhere to heal. If the airplane didn\u2019t require a negative covid test, then they weren\u2019t breaking any rules. Was it ideal for everyone else on the plane? No. But if they family listened to her boundaries, then they wouldn\u2019t be in this mess. \n\nOp, make some hard boundaries with that family. My family gave my husband and I covid and I went low contact them no contact. My husband works with a lot of people and could have infected them without us knowing.", "OP stated she asked several people and was advised to travel.", "You could have contacted the local experts. Doctors. Public health departments, most of which still have a Covid hotline where you can get answers and help dealing.

They weren\u2019t forced on the plane by the army.", "I\u2019m glad someone said this. Lots of airlines have the announcement on their flights that cabin air is changed out every 2 minutes. If OP and her family were wearing masks, sanitising their hands and keeping themselves to themselves then that\u2019s not too bad.
