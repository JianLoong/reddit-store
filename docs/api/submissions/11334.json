You wouldn't say to a woman to hit her partner because they forget to take the bins out, or because they ate the last donut.\n\nEdit; Sorry OP, COMPLETELY misread your comment. But I'm leaving it there in case anyone suggests spanking. \n\nAm also a younger annoying sibling who regularly had physical fights with their bigger sibling. I think the consequences being that everyone else gets donuts free but he must ask is good, just a suggestion I've seen further up. \n\nAlso this is a boundary issue with your wife. If he bites a few, well those are her and his donuts now. And next week, you and your daughter get more donuts if you missed out previous week and they get less. Tough shit.", "Its on you to enforce that. Don't make it your daughters responsibility.", "But there is a consequence -- no more donuts for anyone.", "That's exactly what I'm afraid of. His mom is baking this bad behaviour right into him.", "Wasn\u2019t that the whole point of the sketch? Making fun of actors like Tom Hanks who play disabled people. Maybe autistic wasn\u2019t the exact right word to use, but the character is still definitely portrayed as mentally handicapped", "Op's wife doesn't  let him", "He said he would stop.  Want to guess whether he did or not?", "I think he's saying his kid has gone the full *******.", "I strongly disagree with your comment. Anger is not useful in parenting small children. Do the tiniest amount of research on the topic.\n\nIt\u2019s not an either/or choice. They don\u2019t have to enable the bad behavior or yell.\n\n\u201cA 2014 study in The Journal of Child Development demonstrated that yelling produces results similar to physical punishment in children: increased levels of anxiety, stress and depression along with **an increase in behavioral problems**.\u201d", "And say what? I've tried telling her she is spoiling him.", "I think they used a different word in the movie.", "No, OP\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t let OP get visibly pissed off about it. That\u2019s the only thing she does in the story. It\u2019s not that she refuses any intervention.", "So then he gets no donuts. How is it that hard?", "Then tell him one last time. And if he doesn't stop he doesn't get anymore donuts. If he eats other people donuts, he gets privileges taken away. Rinse and repeat until he learns.", "INFO: op did you really include the Tropic Thunder bit as a covert way of insulting your son? I've seen the movie many times and can't figure out what other point that line has here.", "Why the hell doesn\u2019t he just say it. It\u2019s so dumb to just put that at the top.", "Oh, Jesus. I\u2019m familiar with the film but wouldn\u2019t have guessed someone would say that about their kid, to be honest. How gross.", "It seems like the kid goes to the Midvale School for the Gifted.", "Why are you equating being angry with yelling? I don\u2019t think your comment was made in good faith. You told someone to do research about how bad it is to be angry at a child, then quoted a study on the effects of yelling. \n\nKids need to see that their behaviors cause harm, that they can hurt others with their actions. Shielding a child from knowing you\u2019re angry or upset doesn\u2019t help. Modeling healthy behaviors when we\u2019re angry or upset is important.", "Seven year olds are MORE than old enough to understand the concept of not putting your mouth all over all the doughnuts until you find one you like.", "You don\u2019t have to yell to be angry. If my mom started getting quieter, I either quit what I wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing or run for the hills once she got out of her chair! Never once did I fear her when she had slightly raised voice. And my dad only raised his voice after multiple warnings. But he was angry before he raised his voice. And I wasn\u2019t actually afraid of either parent. I just knew I wouldn\u2019t like either punishment which generally never involved spankings. Only stupid people think everyone who gets angry yells. And only abusive people make their kids scared. I wasn\u2019t afraid of my punishment from either parent, I just didn\u2019t like the punishment enough not to do it again!", "Try telling her she is damaging her son in the long run. If he's doing this on purpose then I doubt he's only doing it at home. Not a good basis for socialization,  harmful to his education etc....\n\nAnd maybe get a 2nd opinion of testing him.", "You've now tried bringing them along and they don't like that so now that's one of the talking points. You've tried moving the donuts and she gives them back to him. Your son can't take a bite/touch all food available to him, it's a problem now and will be one later if this continues. Get a counselor if needed and feasible. Unless the only thing he does this with is donuts and not getting donuts solves the problem it's bigger than the donuts.", "than you need to put boundaries with her.", "Or enforce boundaries and punishment? If they've even tried hiding the donuts and she ignores their son climbing on a chair to get them, then yes she's doing more than just protecting their child from ops anger - she's also enabling. Also why is op the only one attempting any discipline?", "Yep he should get to watch everyone else have donuts and he gets none. Then next week when he behaves and waits his turn he get his share otherwise again no treat. Do be the teacher that punishes the class for one shitty kid.", "Right now he's not getting donuts.", "If you don't know the movie you can just ask.", "But your daughter is being affected.  That isn't right.  It's on you to find a way to fix this without punishing her for his behavior.", "Hey dude please listen to this. You NEED to have your wife read about parenting styles. It sounds to me like her attitude is [permissive parenting.](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-permissive-parenting-2794957) This is really unhealthy for kids. You both should be aiming for [authoritative parenting](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-authoritative-parenting-2794956) styles - please not this is not whatsoever authoritarian parenting, which is terrible for children! Authoritative parents set healthy boundaries, are responsive to children\u2019s needs while giving them context and understanding. They provide love, warmth, and resources while supporting their children with understanding of limits. Authoritative parents are nurturing and research shows that this style is more effective than permissive parenting at developing young children into healthy adults.", "I\u2019ve seen the movie twice, putting that at the top was just really stupid."]}
