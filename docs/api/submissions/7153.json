Pay for your own health insurance?  Cook your own food?) like a child but claim the right to make decisions like an adult.  Move out and support yourself, then you get to call all the shots.  Until then, if you live like a dependent child, why shouldn\u2019t you be treated like one?  All fair and square.   Can\u2019t be an adult when partying and a child when it comes to paying for living expenses.  And lying to avoid consequences is also a very childish behavior.  At least put on your big girl pants and have a talk with your mother about what rights you want and what responsibilities you are willing to shoulder.  YTA and an an infantile one at that.", "NTA.

You no longer need to ask permission, just tell your mom where you're going and what you're doing and when you'll be back.

Act like an adult and hopefully she'll start treating you more like one.", "NTA. \n\nIf you're able to move out I definitely would. If not maybe sitting her down and working out a few boundaries would help.  If she's paying all of your expenses and trying to \"hold that over you\", maybe you can start doing some more on your own. Possibly paying rent, car payment/insurance, buying groceries etc. \n\n If she's still 100% financially responsible for you/ cleaning up after you/ and/or providing all your meals etc, even though you're an adult, it may still feel like you're a child to her. **Not making assumptions, I'm just saying IF that's the case I can see how- to her- not much has changed from your teenage years vs adulthood so she may have a harder time adjusting her mindset.  Making a move toward more \"adult\" independence (if you aren't already) may help her transition her thinking.", "NTA for wanting an adult relationship with someone.

It won\u2019t help.", "As someone who was in this type of situation at OP\u2019s age, being honest with her mother is absolutely not going to help. The only way the mother will let her live there is if she is following the mom\u2019s rules. She mentions not being able to afford moving out which unfortunately means her two options are to lie or to follow the rules until she graduates and can afford her own place. My mom came into my room that I shared with my 3 year old sister and told me I had to follow all of her rules or I needed to move out. There were two pages of rules including that I needed to be home every night by 10pm.  I ended up moving back to campus even though it was overpriced. I used student loans to cover the expenses. Not an ideal situation, but I made it work. Having an honest conversation with parents does not always work.", "Ah, yes, absolutely lying is the sort of recommendation somebody OP\u2019s age would give.

I totally get where you\u2019re coming from. You\u2019re an adult and capable of making your own choices. However, the lying isn\u2019t gonna help. As a 29F with very strict parents, I too had to follow a certain set of rules. If we wanted to stay with a guy overnight, then we had to move out. We want to party? We have to move out. I get that by popular opinion, for good reason, that what your mom is imposing is overkill. But she is within her right to have those rules so long as you live there as her child. Not saying I agree with it\u2014I myself had to move out to make my own decision that my parents disagreed with\u2014but you cannot expect those privileges from a really strict overbearing parent without taking on all the responsibilities of an adult. Crazy I know, but this is a reality for many of us.", "NTA\n\nWhen I saw \"I knew my mom would NEVER let me\" I was like, hold on isn't this girl 20?? Jesus its like parents don't realize that after 18 your child is now a legal adult. Just because you live at home doesn't mean that she should dictate where you go or who you hang out with. (Obvi dangerous situations are different)", "I was cheering you on up to the part where you are spending the night with a guy you barely know.  Your mom is way overbearing and I don\u2019t see you having a relationship with her after you move out.
