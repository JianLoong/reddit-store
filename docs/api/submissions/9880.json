It\u2019s probably also important to note that this cat went from being allowed in their house to being a completely outdoor cat.

The other day I watched him try and go into their house for food and they kicked him back out of the house and there hasn\u2019t been a bowl put outside for him. So I\u2019ve continued feeding him but when I mentioned tonight that I needed to buy cat food, my mum went off on me saying that it\u2019s rude to feed somebody else\u2019s cat and it\u2019ll cause unnecessary tension.

IMO you would be justified in calling Animal Control, or adopting the cat yourself if you want to (and your parents agree, if you live with them).\n\nI got my first cat at university.  It was midwinter and this white cat appeared in our entryway, came in our apartment, looked around and went back to the door.  Next day my roommate saw her, looking wet and dirty and trying to sneak in the chemistry building.  We found her at the Humane Society and waited 10 days for the owner to claim her before we were able to adopt.\n\nIn the spring, the neighbor across the street came over with some cat supplies.

Also you really are a kind and thoughtful kid to not only notice this but take steps to help.", "NAH, you're obviously ND and you should listen to your parents.  It's not your cat and you shouldn't be obsessing over it this much.\n\nMaybe there's a reason they didn't ask you to cat sit.", "NTA but definitely follow what other people suggest, talk with neighbors involved with rescue/foster. When you feed, get senior cat food. There might be kidney or renal issues but they have food for that specifically designed for seniors, although if it's a case of abandonment and starvation, then that's a problem.\n\nOn youtube, there are tons of tutorials on how to make very warm, cozy cat houses for outdoors that could be a temporary shelter although a cat like that should probably live the rest of its life indoors. If you contact a rescue, because it's elderly, I'd ask them about euthanasia and say what your wishes are and if there are resources for abandoned cats or groups if that's their policy. If they're no kill, one thing you do need to be prepared for is that if the cat is very sick, euthanasia might happen if it's a case of quality of life. You might also be able to ask a rescue if they could assist you, if that's the case, in trying to find a possible Fospice placement situation--if the cat is that senior, if there are health problems, it's hard to find sometimes but there are a few really wonderful people who will foster cats like hospice and give them a wonderful place to live out the rest of their days. Not all people can do this because it takes a toll BUT it's one of the most important fostering positions out there. \n\nWhen you're on your own, you might want to consider looking into Fospice yourself with a rescue (and volunteering with a rescue). I volunteered at a kitten NICU and it was emotionally hard at times because we had VERY sickly kittens, many of whom passed away, but I also felt so much purpose and all 11 I brought home to foster and socialize got adopted--the sickest one lives with my Mom and her boyfriend (as well as our first foster, an adult cat who was \"unadoptable\" but chose my mom immediately). We did kittens rather than cats because of me volunteering there, space with a LARGE 3 tier cage for overnights and sometimes during the day when they were quarantining (they were VERY sick), and because our resident cats are very special--one is a natural surrogate mom type but a very tiny cat, about the size of a 7-8 month kitten herself and kittens are obsessed with her. She plays with them and schools them. The other is HUGE but an absolute territorial butthead--he hisses, growls, bops on the head, everything, and the kittens ended up with INCREDIBLE manners and adapted so well with resident cats at home because of him being so boo-hiss. (The resident cats are a fairly young bonded pair). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry, woof! That was long! Either way, just wanted to say your heart's in the right place but also tell you about some opportunities and ideas. I think when you're on your own, you really, really might be a good candidate to become a fospice caretaker (although it is difficult) because of your heart. You should get training on that and it is rewarding (also seniors literally ARE the best). And in the interim, if you volunteer with a rescue, you'll get tons of training in advance and that'll help. :) If there's any way I can offer advice or tips, please don't hesitate to message.", "NTA.  \n\n\nSounds like they don't want the cat since it's too old now. Sounds like they left it out there to starve and die because, apparently, old pets are a hassle to take care of. You're doing a good thing. Keep feeding it, no matter what anyone says.", "Gentle YTA because you're making a lot of assumptions about the cat and don't know the situation. There have been 2 instances in the last years in my neighborhood where well meaning folks were thinking various cats were underfed and not looked after, or even homeless. In fact, each cat did have a home, and was being fed, but they were also ill (one had kidney disease) which was why they looked so thin. They were on special diets too, so you could be screwing that up by feeding them other food.\n\nHave you talked to the cat's owners? Also, if you feel an animal is being mistreated you can report it to animal control or the humane society and they will look into the matter.", "NTA. You're a very decent, kind person. Your parents have some type of societal blinders on. In this case, they're wrong.", "Are you 100% positive this is their cat and not a stray look alike. Yup I say they don\u2019t put their cat outside but all of a sudden do. \n\n\nI had people thinking I was neglecting my cat and it was a stray hanging out. Not mine. \n\nIf their cat is still inside the stray could be attracted to their house by the smell. Or it truly is their cat. But I would find out for sure before doing anything.", "YTA. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be had you gone and talked to them about it/offered to take in the cat, before you started feeding him. However, you don\u2019t know that -\n\nA) they\u2019re not feeding him. What you and your neighbors think you see doesn\u2019t count and every cat I know can fake starvation easily, and \n\nB) any health considerations, especially as he\u2019s an older cat you could be doing harm to his health if you\u2019re not buying the right food\n\nIf you truly want to make sure the cat is being cared for, go talk to his actual owners about what\u2019s going on and how you can help/express that you want to adopt him.", "NAH. Do the parents know all the details/info you've just shared? Are they on the group chat? What they said is a universal truth but with everyu universal truth there's usually a specific exception.

If the neighbor gets mad it'll be because they are trying to control it's diet and its non of your business.  You have no way to know that care situation they have with their cat (if you had the training to know this was pet neglect you presumably wouldn't be asking on reddit).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeave it with mom and dad; they can call animal control if there is suspicion of  pet neglect going on.", "I can\u2019t bring the cat in myself because my mum would go mad and he doesn\u2019t get on with my dogs.

Unfortunately I live with two dogs and our attempts to introduce them to this cat have not gone well so I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to adopt him and my mum also hates cats.

Idk my dad usually only agrees with my mum in front of her, I feel like when I ask him about it when she\u2019s gone to bed he\u2019ll give me the money and tell me to just hide the food as he loves animals too.

I have been trying to get the proper food and have been researching it a lot. It\u2019s true that I haven\u2019t spoken to them, I think I\u2019d probably get a bit heated because I\u2019m quite passionate about not being dicks to animals, but I know what they are like as our families used to be quite close until an unrelated incident. I wish I could adopt him but I can\u2019t, though based off what they\u2019ve been saying on the streets\u2019 group chat they\u2019d be fine with it as it comes across like they\u2019re just waiting for him to pass on. I\u2019ll try and have a word with them though", "Yeah I told them all of it repeatedly and so has my sister.

Old cats are often instantly put down.\n\nIf people on NextDoor are concerned, I would reach out to them with direct messages and ask if any of them could take the cat if you work with a rescue to trap it.\n\nIf you can find it a retirement home, maybe you can be this cat's savior. :)\n\nI will note that at that age, it's likely the cat won't use a litter box anymore, is incontinent, and that is why its owners kicked it out. Which may make it tough to find a new home for me.\n\nMaking it comfortable outside with food and shelter may be the best you can do, and if it is, that's ok.", "I think you should look up places specializing in senior cat adoption/placement. I think there are a lot of people who take on senior cats to make sure they don't die in shelters. \n\nBut you guys might also consider that the stress of moving the cat might not be a great idea. If you can get together with the neighbours and figure out somewhere for him to stay, a feeding schedule, etc... then it would probably be better for the cat. They tend to be creatures of habit.", "That breaks my heart. The poor thing is lonely because it lost its family and home.\n\nMy parents feed a stray cat sometimes but it does pretty damn well on its own. It's been kicking around for yeaaars. My parents actually got it fixed and got it some shots. They are/can be pretty good hunters and self sufficient. But for an indoor cat to suddenly be thrown outside, required to live on it's own devices is beyond cruel.", "Where abouts in the UK are you?\n\nThere are a fair few no-kill shelters near me (West Midlands, England), and one (Stray Cat Rescue Team) has a bit of a tendency to take in cats that wouldn't be able to find a place elsewhere, but I know they're pretty full. There may be something similar near you.\n\nTry looking for rescues on CatChat dot org- you can search by city for local rescues you might be able to contact, and if your went to be doubly sure you can look into any rescues you find to check they're No Kill first.

Yeah that's tough I understand. From experience, doing something like that will get found out eventually and it might be better overall to let it go. \n\nI think you should talk to your parents though and tell them you're really concerned about the cats welfare. Maybe they could talk to the neighbors for you and make sure the cat is being taken care of. \n\nAlso from experience, cats are really greedy. They will eat a meal then turn around and ask for another. I had an outside cat when I was young who frequented a few different houses and got fed/combed. He got so chubby, living the good life lol. But my point being the cat might just be getting double the food and you might not realize it. \n\nIf you can't get your parents to care, then maybe bite the bullet and call animal control. They should make sure the cat is being cared for.

The cat has a home and you're just baiting it.  Stop.", "No problem! \n\nOnce you start fostering, just start slowly for sure. It can get overwhelming for sure and some people get burned out! But volunteering is A GREAT way to get involved first! Also contacting the rescue to talk with them about a strategy and situation will be great because they want to know how to help. I think it's wonderful you want to go the senior route because that's the hardest for people in general. \n\nIt's also possible that it's not kidney, renal, other issues either!!! :) It could be malnutrition or hyper or hypothyroidism or a myriad of other things. there's really just no way to tell at this stage unfortunately.

If the cat is outside with no shelter, food, and water...no bowls whatsoever, then what they're doing is illegal and considered animal abuse. They could get into trouble. Then again, animal control could take the cat and have it euthanised. Could ask what could happen to the cat before mentioning specifics.", "NTA - The cat is getting older.   They kicked him out of the house as a way of washing   \ntheir hands of him to save on vet bills.  Not sure what the rules are in UK for abandoning a pet, but the cat needs to be rehomed.

If you tell them in they can investigate and you have a clear conscience IMO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your parents give you permission to talk to the neighbor (or do so themselves) and you have their permission to feed the cat... then go crazy.", "Someone suggested that he won\u2019t survive if he stays outside so I\u2019m going to call a no kill shelter in the morning for him", "That\u2019s a good idea! I\u2019ll look into that, thanks!", "I don\u2019t have his number or anything unfortunately and I think he\u2019s moved cities", "Good idea! He is such a sweet cat, I\u2019d have thought my dad would be on my side because he loves animals", "I might speak to the lady that lives next door to them. We have a sort of feeding schedule sorted out between us as she\u2019s concerned too and I know her kids love him", "Yeah I was also worried about the stress on him, that\u2019s why I was just feeding him hoping to keep him a bit more comfortable than he was without putting him through any unnecessary stress.", "Yeah it\u2019s so sad, no animal deserves that. \nI think he was lucky in the sense that our houses back up onto a forest so he had places to hunt for food, but I\u2019m assuming he started approaching me because he\u2019s getting too old for all that now, idk if that\u2019s how cats work but it\u2019s the only reason I can think of as to why he suddenly came to me.", "I\u2019m up in the North West, I have the name of a good place from my friend who used to foster through them and they\u2019re no kill!", "Yeah I\u2019ve always wanted a cat but I was never able to get one, he\u2019s so sweet too", "I\u2019m hoping longer than he would because I\u2019m feeding him. I\u2019m not sure because that cat is probably well over 20 at this point", "This cat did used to be extremely greedy but his entire demeanour has changed now so I\u2019m feeling like it\u2019s not just him being greedy. He used to let you feed him and turn around and attack you the next minute, but now he\u2019ll let you stroke him for as long as you want, I was sat outside for an hour and a half the other night with him. I probably will call someone, I\u2019m not that bothered about getting in trouble with my parents though, I\u2019d rather know I was in the right and have them annoyed at me than let an innocent animal suffer", "I think he\u2019s got problems with his eyes because they look weird. \nYeah my friend has told me how rewarding fostering is and I want to do it at some point", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m just going to hope the no kill shelter can get him. He\u2019s disappeared a few times for a couple of days and I thought he had gone off to die but he luckily has come back", "They are awful, I\u2019m not a vet so obviously can\u2019t tell if anything\u2019s majorly wrong but he doesn\u2019t look too unhealthy, minus the lack of grooming and I think he\u2019s getting cataracts. It\u2019s so sad, I\u2019m going to contact a shelter my friend trusts; they have a no destruction policy and a great foster system", "Yeah I\u2019ll send my dad over to ask in the morning or I\u2019ll contact my friends mum who\u2019s used to dealing with this sort of thing. Thanks for the advice!", "Yay hope it all works out. You seem like a really nice person.", "Can you try finding him on facebook?", "Your use of grammar suggests that you're not in the US, but if you are there is a website called FamilyTreeNow . com. You can put in someone's name and figure out which one he is by his old address and then find his new address. \n\nI used it to track down a childhood friend who had moved from Florida to Hawaii but whose father still lived in their old town, the cousin in Michigan of a man in Arizona who left his phone at a bus stop, and the person who dropped a marriage certificate outside a courthouse.\n\n(PM me if you need help.)", "He is!  He's just keeping it on the down low!  Feed the kitties!  :)", "That would be a great start!", "Yeah you should def get a cat when u get older if u want to because i tell you they are the best thing ever. My family feeds the kitty's neighbour, we dont tell the neighbour because maybe she would complain. She was skinny, but right now she looks healthy and not hungry. We even named her Chimu and she tells me if she wants food. Neighbours won't know unless you happen to tell them.", "NTA. That poor cat needs to be indoors because of his age. Either call a rescue or adopt him yourself. Your neighbors have in fact abandoned him & he will die from being outside at his age. Especially since he's been an inside cat for so long :(", "Good for you! I fully agree, but I don't want to pressure you or anyone else to go against their parents (especially when you're still living with them and they can make your life difficult). \n\nAnd that's part of growing up too. I have a few memories of where I did the right thing and got in trouble for it. It happens, unfortunately. But I still don't regret any of them. Punishments are temporary, your morals will be with you till you die.", "I'm guessing he's probably got a URI, especially if it was an indoor to outdoor situation (but also if you're in the UK and it's winter). \n\nI'd REALLY recommend also looking on Youtube for temporary shelters. There are ways to make some with cheap construction in the interim but looks like medical attention is necessary. BUT!!! But but but, it might not be serious. URIs are like colds so they can be bad but also can be easy to manage, but eyes are really sensitive so it's important to get some help. A lot of times if it's just a URI, an oral medication is what it takes (pill or syringe) Sometimes there might be an eye infection and that's a little more tricky if it's eyedrops but they can teach you if they don't take over (backing them against a wall so they can't move backwards--they won't go forwards...the move is backwards) will help. There is also an ointment/gel for eyes that SOUNDS terrifying and LOOKS terrifying at first--it is 100000% easier. I'd take that over eyedrops literally any day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck! You seem like a kindhearted, wonderful pperson!", "Thank you! Animals are just my weak spot; I always just think about what if it were my dogs needing the kindness of strangers and how I\u2019d want someone to extend the same care to them should something ever happen", "I spoke to my mum about contacting him and she told me I\u2019m not to. She doesn\u2019t want it causing unnecessary drama between the neighbours, which is funny considering she does it all the time lmao", "Ah I\u2019m in the uk but thanks for the suggestion!", "I\u2019m calling a no kill shelter in the morning, reflecting on it I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair or right to expect him to live outside in the winter at his age, he deserves to be at least warm inside", "Failing that I\u2019ll probably speak to my friends mum and see if she knows anyone, she used to foster cats all the time", "I\u2019ve always got on well with cats, even the ones that hate everyone have been nice to me. That\u2019s so great that you\u2019re doing that for Chimu! I was also thinking that they wouldn\u2019t see me because the area where I feed him is blocked by my other neighbours house so they\u2019d only see the cat running up to greet me when I come home from school", "I contacted a friend that fostered cats from somewhere and she said they\u2019re very good and have put older cats in their foster program too, I\u2019m going to give them a call in the morning. I wish I could take him in as I\u2019ll be sad to see him go but unfortunately it\u2019s not possible currently", "Nah we argue a lot anyway, at least this time would be for something good and that would be helping something in need", "I\u2019ll see if I can find my dogs old bed for him while we wait for the shelter people", "Them leaving a cat outside to die is the only thing causing drama. You, and your other neighbours are concerned. The drama is already happening...why not add a little more?", "Try the RSPCA then.", "Also great! If she's plugged into the foster networks she might know somebody who specializes in elderly animals.\n\nI volunteer for a cat rescue and just want you to know that it's wonderful that you are trying so hard for this animal. Know that sometimes these stories don't have happy endings and it's okay if that ends up being the case - the most important thing is trying. <3", "They def dont know about it. Dumbass neighbours u got mate. Honestly, im happy u are there for ur kitty too", "I hope the foster can help him. He definitely deserves to be safe & warm :)", "I agree with that; my mum is pure acting like these neighbours don\u2019t already ignore us because of an argument with my older sister", "I\u2019ve found a shelter that is great for senior cats. The owners of the shelter will probably take him or he\u2019ll get his own room according to my friend who works closely with them", "Yeah it sucks that not every story has happy endings, imo animals deserve the world", "I know they used to let people in the street feed him all the time but this was about 7/8 years ago so they might have changed their mind. Other people have pointed out that due to his age he might struggle to survive outside so I think I\u2019m going to give a no kill shelter a call in the morning. Thank you for all your advice!", "So do I, he\u2019s actually become great with kids also, which was a shock as he used to hate my friends growing up and only let me near him. I\u2019ve seen him enjoying cuddles from my other neighbours kids, so hopefully that might help him out when it comes to rehoming him", "I'd reach out to him & let him know the situation, maybe he has a friend who can get the cat for him.", "My mum and sister are the only one that have his info unfortunately, and my sister will phone my mum if I ask her", "NTA.  It sounds like they've all but abandoned the cat and you're effectively adopting it.", "NTA. I would talk to the neighbors about them not seemingly wanting the cat anymore, and if that's the case, they should surrender him to animal welfare services, not constantly kicking him out and not feeding him.", "NTA but your parents and your neighbour are. Good on you for caring for a defenceless animal!", "NTA you are a good person.", "Glad you've got somewhere.\n\nMight be worth looking into some other places in case they don't have space- rescues up and down the country are full. Last summer my husband and I tried to get help for a stray cat, but no one I contacted could help any time soon. We ended up taking him in while we waited, and then grew too find of him so he's ours now (our other 3 still aren't used to him, which is why we were reluctant).", "My friend said that she thinks the owners of the shelter will take him home with them as they don\u2019t like to leave elderly cats there, but I\u2019ll look into some alternatives. Thanks!", "Thank you so much for this update. If you share the name of the shelter I'll make a donation in your honor, if that's allowed by the sub.", "NTA, I\u2019d call around to some local animal shelters and/or cat rescues and see if they can send someone out to pick him up/speak with the family. Or maybe asking around to see if another neighbor would be willing to take in the cat.", "NTA I've said it before and I'll say it again, people who keep their cats outdoors don't care about the cat at all.", "NTA - call animal control", "Throwing a 20 year old cat out of your house and not feeding does actually make you an asshole.", "Because they abandoned their cat and don't care if it eats.", "They put a 20 year old cat outside????\n\nLike I'm anti-outdoor cat in general but that's just cruel. That's an old man.", "NTA It\u2019s not rude to save a cat from animal cruelty. Is a compromise possible? Like an outdoor inclosure for the cat? It\u2019s not ideal but it\u2019s better than a kill shelter.", "NTA Those\u2026people have essentially abandoned a trusting cat. Good for you!", "NTA. You're very kind. Your neighbors on the other are enormous AH's . If you are certain that they are neglecting this poor senior cat, it needs to be reported.", "Why are they abandoning their cat?? Report the bastards! Nta! Why on earth is anyone on their side?!? They\u2019re monsters and you\u2019re a life-saver!\nPS I hope you have a cat now. That poor senior kitizen, being tossed out in his old age!", "NTA!! I think you're wonderful by feeding their cat which shouldn't be their cat if they refuse to care for it. That is cruelty to animals. I believe that is a felony in all 50 states. Thank you for caring for the cat. Being an elder cat, you are right in assuming it can't fend for itself. Thank you.", "I find it terribly cruel to put an inside pet out to fend for itself when it gets old. They need us Most then. Please feed this cat. Take him in if your parents allow or try to find a neighbor to take him in. He doesn\u2019t deserve this and they are obviously done caring for him. Poor baby", "NTA.\n\nHe's yours now.\n\nI would definitely try talking to them directly to see wtf is up.", "Often elder animals are overlooked, especially cats. A no kill shelter might be what the cat needs temporarily but often shelter animals shut down due to noise, sadness, they give up. I am certain this cat would rather be with NTA. This is hard. Why people need to think hard before they get a pet. Your pet will need you more than ever in their elder years.", "I just want to thank you for your kind heart,  my 16 year old cat is currently in remission from cancer,  and we're so happy he's eating more and putting weight back on.  It breaks my heart to think of him outside and hungry.  I'll never understand the cruelty of some people.  Thankfully, there are good people like you in the world.", "Makes sense then. Wonder if they are hoping he will go away instead of just taking him to a shelter", "Yea, but they neighbors aren't calling OP asshole, parents are.", "Some people really suck.", "Being okay with animal abuse also makes you an asshole.", ">I\u2019m going to call a no kill shelter in the morning for him\n\nAsk them how they define \"no kill\", and find out what their \"live release rate\" is.   Most no kill shelters say they don't euthanize *adoptable* animals. But they define adoptable.  \n\nI took a super friendly 3yo stray cat into our no kill shelter.  Fortunately, I called to check her status 3 days later after her hold period was up, as they had decided she was unadoptable because she was acting scared instead of friendly at the shelter, so she was scheduled to be euthanized.  I picked her up and took her to the next region's shelter, which genuinely does not euthanize animals unless they have untreatable, painful medical conditions.", "Yes!  Please OP read this comment.  Depending on the climate where you are you have some time to figure this out, as long as you can keep them fed and comfortable outside for a bit.  If the cat has fleas and you can afford a topical med, it would mean the world as well.  I wish you and poor kitty the best.", "I would probably tell them about the situation and about the son in uni. I'm not sure if it would make a difference, but if there's a chance that the son loves the cat it might be good for him.", "Hear, hear!"]}
