So we all have chores in the house assigned to each person. I clean upstairs, my sister cooks, my mom cleans downstairs, and my dad cleans the bathrooms. Because she cooks for all of us, she thinks she is sustaining the family. She talks about how important her task is and how unimportant mines are. Sure we need to eat and we can live if the floor is unvacuumed or trash is lying around, but that does not discount my contributions. Additionally, she scrutinizes every mistake I make. I'm in my second year of biomedical engineering, and taking hard courses. I got a C in one of them, and it's my first C. My parents are disappointed, especially since I'm out of state and they're paying my tuition. And now my sister is saying that she's the better child because she has all A's. I also had all A's in high school, and I explained that differential equations is a beast. She says that she would get an A in the course, and said that it was my fault I failed a course (which I did not in fact).\n\nAnd she deliberately embarrasses me. I've done some pretty shameful things as a kid, and she brings them up over and over again around my parents. Those things happened when I was under 10, and now my parents are using this a justification for why I'm incompetent. She also records my conversations with my friends. Like I'm in my room chatting on discord, and sometimes we say goofy stuff, or talk about more personal stuff like love lives. I don't even hear her walking up to my room, and I only know she was recording because she shows my parents the recording. And then I get unfairly confronted for my inside jokes with my friends others won't understand, or having a crush on someone at my college. She also chats with her friends and talks about stuff my parents wouldn't be so happy to hear, and when I record her to give her a taste of her own medicine, my parents get mad at me for recording her, saying that I must respect her. I point out that she invades my life by recording me, but they say that it's for my own good. \n\nWell now my sister thinks that she is superior to me, and my parents let her act that way. They literally said I should drop out of college and wait until she starts college, and then I go to college with her and start over in architecture (her major plans), so that she can take care of me and monitor me almost 24/7. My dad said it was a mistake to give me so much independence, being alone at college and studying biomed, which according to him I failed. He suggested I should just drop out and apply to college in the same year as my sister as an architect major. I refused, saying that I can survive independently, and that my sister does not get to control me, and that I do not want to undo my hard work the last year and a half.
