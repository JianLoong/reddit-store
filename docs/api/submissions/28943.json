{"id": 28943, "submission_id": "177zltk", "title": "AITA for telling my roommate his girlfriend cannot have a key to our apartment?", "selftext": "Myself (F, 25) and my boyfriend (M, 24) live with one of our friends (M, 24). Our roommate started dating his girlfriend (F, 20) around 8 months ago. Ever since the start of the relationship, he has given her his spare key and allowed her to stay in the house unattended for several hours at a time.\n\nMy boyfriend and I bit our tongues for several months, in hopes we would become friends with his girlfriend. However, the opposite has occurred. She seldom says hello to us and makes no attempt to get to know us. We have tried to make conversation on numerous occasions and it has been like conversing with a wall. \n\nWe brought the situation up with our roommate around 3 months ago and he basically said \u201cwhat would you prefer, the front door to be unlocked at all time instead?\u201d. We got nowhere.\n\nThen, a month ago, his girlfriend lost the key which prompted him to ask us for a new one (my boyfriend\u2019s family owns the apartment). When he was given the new key, we asked him to keep it for himself. Spoiler alert, that did not happen.\n\nFast forward to two days ago. My boyfriend and I came home from a short vacation to find his girlfriend in the apartment alone and the key we had re-cut for him sitting on the dining room table. We took the key, and once his girlfriend thought the coast was clear, she snuck out without talking to us.\n\nWe sat down with our roommate and voiced our concerns again. We made it clear that we want to know his girlfriend better, but right now it feels like there is a stranger in our home, unsupervised. As a guest, we feel she should be let in and let out. He basically rebuttled saying she isn\u2019t going to get to know us because she\u2019s \u201ctoo shy\u201d, it\u2019s our responsibility to make her comfortable here, and that we should just trust her because we trust him.\n\nHe had a conversation with her that did not go well and now she apparently \u201chates us\u201d and does not want to come over if we are here. To me, this solves nothing and makes me feel even more uncomfortable knowing that now, they will strategically plan for her to be in our house, where all our possessions are, when we are not there. I am at the point where I feel like we need a lock on our bedroom door and camera on our bedside table. All I wanted was to get to know her better, and in turn feel better about her being in the house/having a key, but now we have a volatile situation on our hands and our roommate is super upset with us. I am now feeling guilty for making our roommate and good friend upset and left wondering if we are being the assholes.\n\nSo\u2026AITA?", "created_utc": 1697319038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177zltk/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_his_girlfriend/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
