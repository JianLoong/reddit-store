Doesn't matter how long you known them, dynamics change when romance is involved.\n\nAnd I always judge the quality of my relationship not necessarily on the highs, but on the lows.

I'm definitely no psychiatrist but to go from getting up at 5am to take you on a date to go into sleeping all the time definitely isn't right. Maybe he's given up after the chase but does that resonate with the man you have known for more than 3 years? \n\nThe problem, if there is one, is that you haven't been in a relationship with him or living with him for long enough to know if this is a pattern or a blip.\n\nYou need to tell him you're not happy, and you struggling to reconcile the man who woo'd you with the man you're now married to. He's said he's happier than ever, in the words of Matthew McConaughey \"Bullsh*t\" And if he still denies anything then you have a decision to make over whether he has deceived you and what you want to do about it", "NTA for your feelings, but I'm not going to jump on the abuser/gave up after the chase bandwagon yet.  Is there anything going on at work for him that might be an issue, any physical or mental health issues.

It's a sad reality with many relationships that when the chase ends, the real person starts to show their colors.  I always told myself that I will be myself from the first meeting, the first date, and beyond. It is the fairest way to be with someone. Let them see the real you and they can decide for themselves that's who they want to be with. My wife of 31 years is with the same man she met 33 years ago. I was a goofy, talkative, farting, burping, singing and reliable young man. She absolutely knew what she was getting into with me.  \n\nI know so many people that have had the \"bait and switch\" kind of relationships and it always drove me crazy.

He\u2019s just a lazy oaf and neglecting her. Those are two very different things.", "I'd disagree with \"abuser\" label being thrown around here. OP hasn't detailed any abuse in their post.
