I just think she can be a bit inconsiderate at times.\n\nMy son (15M) has what my wife calls a \"deadpan voice\". While I admit he doesn't show much enthusiasm when speaking, I think he has a right to express himself in his own way. My wife, however, insists that he needs to be more enthusiastic and vocal. She often tells him to \"speak up\" or \"say it with feeling\" and I can tell that it gets to him.\n\nMy wife recently started taking a different approach, which I can tell really bothers him. When addressing him, she talks in the most enthusiastic voice she can muster. She'll even go so far as to clap her hands and make facial expressions as she talks to him. \"How was school today? Tell me all about it! Speak LOUDLY and with ENTHUSIASM!\" (Think kindergarten teacher talking to her students). My son just looks at her like she's crazy and I can tell he's embarrassed.\n\nI have tried to privately talk to my wife about this, but she doesn't seem to get it. She insists that her way is the \"right\" way and that our son needs to learn how to be more outgoing.\n\nSo fast forward to yesterday. We were celebrating Christmas at my sister-in-law's house and my son asked me to pass the gravy. My wife, in her usual enthusiastic voice, started saying \"Say it with feeling, honey! Can you ask for the gravy with enthusiasm?!\" I snapped. It's one thing to do this when it's just the two of us, but doing this in front of our family was too much. I got up, took my son, and took him to the movies, leaving my wife with the other family members.\n\nAfter we got back, my wife pulled me aside and absolutely ripped into me for causing a scene. She said that I was embarrassing her and that I was out of line. I told her that I was tired of her trying to \"fix\" our son's personality and that I felt this was a good opportunity to make a point. My wife's family hasn't said anything to me, but I've been getting a lot of judgemental looks from them.\n\nI just wanted to stick up for my son, but did I go too far? AITA?", "created_utc": 1672467450, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zznazk/aita_for_leaving_dinner_early_and_causing_a_scene/", "score": 308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She looks foolish talking like that, your son witnesses it and will not replicate it or anything close. The last thing a 15 yo wants it to look foolish. As someone with the same kind of speaking manner, at 15 this behaviour would of made me retreat back into myself. It\u2019s bizarre she thinks this it appropriate.

The other has Asperger\u2019s. Either way- this approach doesn\u2019t work. \n\nFor someone with Asperger\u2019s- her actions might be confusing at best, bullying at worst. And she is not the right person to assess his behavioral therapy needs if there are any. \n\nFor someone neurotypical- your wife\u2019s behavior is condescending and bullying. And it will just cause him to withdraw further. She shamed him in front of family. He\u2019s a teenager- and she has three years before he\u2019s a legal adult and she quickly loses the balance of power in their relationship. If she keeps this up and doesn\u2019t rectify it- he\u2019s just going to bide his time until he can go low or no contact.\n\nI would insist on family therapy.", "NTA. She embarrassed herself. Apparently, she is OK with embarrassing your son. I guess we should only worry about her? Thank you for sticking up for your son. Let her family look all they want.

Your wife is lucky that your son is not enthusiastically telling her to shut up.", "NTA in the grand scheme of things. \n\nYou have spoken to her about it privately. Your son is clearly not comfortable with her trying to force him to change who he is. And she proceeds to do it and embarrass him in front of everyone. If possible try and get some type of counseling or mediator to try to get her to understand that although her heart may be in the right place she is hurting your son. Leave the kid alone. Let him be \u201cdeadpan\u201d. Some people make whole careers out of it. And also, there is literally nothing wrong with him being who he is and I sincerely hope she gets it sooner rather than later.", "NTA.\n\nI am going to give your wife the benefit of the doubt for a second and believe she thinks he's unhappy and just wants the best for him. It's one thing to want the best for your child and help them be happy in any way you can. It's another to believe the best way to achieve that is to change the way someone talks. First off, believing someone's enthusiasm is a mark of their happiness level is sadly incorrect. Let's pretend he's depressed. All she is doing is training him to fake his enthusiasm around her. She'll be happy while her son feels more and more alienated in actual depression.\n\nNow I'm not going to give her the benefit of the doubt. It's possible she feels embarrassed by his deadpan voice and it makes her self conscious about her own social status. Telling him to be enthusiastic when asking for GRAVY of all things IN FRONT of people leads me to believe she wants to be seen as trying to \"be a good mom\" in front of others. It's not about your son. If it were, she would have an adult conversation with him. She's applying an untruth onto him specifically so she can \"fix\" him and look good around other people. Her fears of looking bad to other people is all she is focused on.\n\nHer family may or may not be AH themselves since their perspective is fed to them by your wife, but they are definitely a product of the same environment your wife came from.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to solve the problem the proper way but your wife wouldn't budge.  She has done nothing but escalate it when it hasn't worked and only caused more discomfort and embarrassment.  She needed to be taught a lesson and this was a really effective way to do it, so not only are you NTA, but I say bravo to you!", "Nta, good for you. I can't force emotions.  I'm monotone so people assume my emotions aren't there. They are, it's just differently expressed than them. She's on the fast track to being cut out once he gets old enough to move out.", "NTA. Not relevant, but is your wife the mother of your son?", "Maybe you and your son should start talking to her like some people talk to their pets, in that kind of baby talk/ super sweet kind of way.  Like if she makes dinner be like, \u201cWho\u2019s the GOOD GIRL!?  Who\u2019s the GOOD GIRL!?\u201d", "I think you haven't taken this far enough.  Your wife is basically bullying your son over something that is only important to her.", "NTA. My daughter is the same way and she has high functioning autism. She doesn\u2019t really get excited by anything either unless it\u2019s something she\u2019s really into. Honestly I don\u2019t get why anyone would ask for gravy or similar requests with enthusiasm either. If someone spoke to me with overly enthusiastic attitude about a small request like that I would think they were talking to me like you hear people talk in a high pitched voice to babies or small toddlers. It would be demeaning as I\u2019m not either of those.", "Her approach is not going to work. I'm also not very expressive in my day to day life. And although it even costed me a job once, I won't feel comfortable at all if people criticise how I behave.\n\nNTA, I hop your wife gets it now", "You should have declared your departure. NTA", "NTA.\n\n\u201cShe said I was embarrassing her\u201d but she\u2019s embarrassing her own son? IN FRONT of others? \n\nSo many teenagers talk unenthusiastically. It\u2019s NORMAL behavior and a lot of the times it can be because theyre depressed. Your wife\u2019s actions probably add to it. How does he feel whenever she does this\u2014inadequate? Like a failure? I bet she finds other ways your son isn\u2019t perfect besides this. \n\nShe needs a wake up call and you gave her one.", "NTA. I applaud your son for not having a moment of temporary insanity and chucking the gravy boat at her overly enthusiastic face.", "NTA. I also have a deadpan voice, and even when I try to \u201cseem enthused\u201d it just makes it clear I\u2019m being very fake.\n\nThe bigger issue, though, is your wife purposefully doing something that clearly upsets and embarrasses your son. I\u2019d say YTA for taking him out of dinner in the middle of it but honestly, you\u2019ve clearly tried to communicate it over and over, and she\u2019s not listening. Maybe this will help get the message through that it\u2019s NOT okay. She\u2019s picking on your son in the guise of \u201cparenting\u201d (something my mother with NPD did, to be clear), and using it as an excuse.", "NTA", "NTA I don\u2019t like saying your wife is the a h but she\u2019s not listening. Your son will distance himself from her if she\u2019s not careful", "NTA \n\nRemind your wife that teens never respond well to public humiliation, and that's exactly what she was doing to your son. \n\nFunny how *she* doesn't like being embarrassed in front of her family, but it's OK for her to do it to him. Why couldn't she just let the poor kid have a nice day?", "NTA for Pete's sake, what a horrible thing for a mother to do to a kid!  My husband is on the spectrum and is monotone like this, he rarely shows any vocal emotion, and I can't even FATHOM humiliating him like that.", "NTA. \nThis is abuse. What else does she do and how long has this been going on?\nWish my dad had stood up for me as you did for your son.", "NTA. She SHOULD feel embarrassed because what she did was mean-spirited and dumb.", "NTA your wife is speaking to him like his is a 5 year old and it is not okay i used to have \"deadpan\" voice and my mother would speak to me like this it made me irratated and made me feel like i was a little kid it was embaressing and she needs to understand that and respect his personality and to stop trying to change him i can see him resenting her if she continues this behavior and i hope she learns from this.", "NTA. You wife is out of line for trying to turn your son into something he is not. She is sending a clear message that he is not good enough and doing it in a bullying way. After repeated attempts to get her to stop, you stopped it by walking away. Someone needs to look out for your son and clearly his mother isn\u2019t doing it.", "NTA but your wife is.", "How do you ask for gravy with enthusiasm?? ; Asking for a friend", "NTA\n\nSome people are just stoic naturally. Her trying to press and treat your son like a toddler instead of a teen 3 years away from adulthood will ruin any relationship she has with him. And the fact you can tell that your son was getting annoyed at this approach says that you know your son better than your wife", "NTA\n\nYour wife is a bully. You kept the issue private until she made the issue a public one. How dare she embarrass and harass that poor child in front others! \n\nLoudly and with enthusiasm, tell her you would like both of you to seek marriage counseling as well as individual services for your son(he might not express it, but he is affected by her treatment of him) and if she refuses, you will be seeking to dissolve the relationship. \n\nI can handle anything thrown at me, but I will be damned if someone is going to harass and bully any of my children and think there won't be any consequences. Protect your children!", "A tough one, but I'd go with NTA. You tried to talk this out with your wife and she seems to nit really care. But what she does is bulling at this point. I'm sorry for the kid who has to withstand her behavior at home, but when she does it in front of others....\nI mean, did you make a point? Yes! Was it the best way to act? No. But hence your wife doesn't understand talking things out in private, that seems like the best way yo act, although assholish nonetheless", "NTA.

My 12 son also has that monotone speaking voice, and I know it can be irritating or it causes people to lose interest in what they're saying. So, I feel for your kid. Btw, does your kid suffer from anxiety disorders, or is he on the autism spectrum? My son has crippling social and generalized anxiety, and I believe these conditions usually contribute to that monotone/deadpan speaking style.\n\nRegardless, this should never be brought up around anyone but the most private and intimate family members (typically mom and dad).

When a quiet person speaks, I listen *because* they consider their words and commentary and usually have something thoughtful to add. Chances are, your wife is making his reticence worse.

I just think she can be a bit inconsiderate at times.\n\nMy son (15M) has what my wife calls a \"deadpan voice\". While I admit he doesn't show much enthusiasm when speaking, I think he has a right to express himself in his own way. My wife, however, insists that he needs to be more enthusiastic and vocal. She often tells him to \"speak up\" or \"say it with feeling\" and I can tell that it gets to him.\n\nMy wife recently started taking a different approach, which I can tell really bothers him. When addressing him, she talks in the most enthusiastic voice she can muster. She'll even go so far as to clap her hands and make facial expressions as she talks to him. \"How was school today? Tell me all about it! Speak LOUDLY and with ENTHUSIASM!\" (Think kindergarten teacher talking to her students). My son just looks at her like she's crazy and I can tell he's embarrassed.\n\nI have tried to privately talk to my wife about this, but she doesn't seem to get it. She insists that her way is the \"right\" way and that our son needs to learn how to be more outgoing.\n\nSo fast forward to yesterday. We were celebrating Christmas at my sister-in-law's house and my son asked me to pass the gravy. My wife, in her usual enthusiastic voice, started saying \"Say it with feeling, honey! Can you ask for the gravy with enthusiasm?!\" I snapped. It's one thing to do this when it's just the two of us, but doing this in front of our family was too much. I got up, took my son, and took him to the movies, leaving my wife with the other family members.\n\nAfter we got back, my wife pulled me aside and absolutely ripped into me for causing a scene. She said that I was embarrassing her and that I was out of line. I told her that I was tired of her trying to \"fix\" our son's personality and that I felt this was a good opportunity to make a point. My wife's family hasn't said anything to me, but I've been getting a lot of judgemental looks from them.\n\nI just wanted to stick up for my son, but did I go too far? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You have to know so you can know how to act- bc HIS OPINION IS THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS. \n\nThink about getting him therapy and do it if he expresses that this has really hurt/damaged him.
