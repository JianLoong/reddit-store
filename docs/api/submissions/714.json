If I tell them I don\u2019t feel comfortable anymore they might put two and two together and I\u2019m sure they\u2019d feel shitty that\u2019s the main reason I want to be a bit more distant.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019d almost be more unkind to lead them on or fake an attraction. It may hurt their feelings a little, and you don\u2019t have to tell them the truth about why you want to stop flirting (actually for the sake of their self esteem i recommend you don\u2019t) but you aren\u2019t obligated to continue flirting with them if you don\u2019t want to. Either tell them the truth or find an excuse, but don\u2019t keep doing something that makes you uncomfortable"]}
