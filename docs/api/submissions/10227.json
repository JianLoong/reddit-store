My relationship with my sister isn't the best, though, but i thought it had improved because of my niece.\n\nLast weekend, we were at my mom's house, and my niece questioned something along the lines, \"Did you and Daddy separate because you never kissed?\"  I didn't hear the question very well, but when asked why she said that, she answered because she saw me and my boyfriend kiss each other and say thank you and goodbye.\n\nMy sister went feral, she said I'm displaying this kind of behavior to her at such a young age for her to sleep with every man in sight like I do which isn't true but she says that because I've had 2 boyfriend's before my current one. \n\nI explained that we never did more than a peck. Our mom reminded her how we grew up on this and that it's normal, but she kept shaming me and our mom for this.\n\nI told her that if her daughter parents weren't in love, it's not my fault, and I asked her to throw her insecure ass somewhere else. My sister left, and she hasn't spoken to my mom since then, but she keeps texting me, saying she'll never allow me to spend time with her daughter. My mom said my response was really harsh knowing how toxic her past relationship was, and I do admit that, but she was shaming me for something she doesn't know about and she could care for her daughter on her own if something as simple as pecking my partner is very inappropriate for an 8 year old, AITA?", "created_utc": 1676661609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114v3f1/aita_for_calling_my_sister_insecure_because_she/", "score": 404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As long as you weren\u2019t full on making out in front of her you are fine. Most Disney movies also show kissing. Does you sister monitor every kiss on the TV and movies she watches. You can\u2019t escape it.

I wouldn\u2019t want mine to be emotionally stunted so I still kiss my 3yo boy and honestly there is *nothing* wrong with that.", "NTA she sounds jealous....", "NTA, assuming you\u2019re right that it\u2019s only ever quick pda and nothing more intense in front of the niece.\n\nShe can\u2019t shield her child from seeing couples in public \u2014 it\u2019s going to happen. The niece might as well have her clear first exposure to wholesome intimacy by seeing someone she knows and loves.", "NTA. She's overreacting and being way over-the-top.", "NTA, the kid has also absolutely seen worse in movies. It\u2019s a good thing for a child to be exposed to reasonable age appropriate and healthy affection. They never see it and then the first shitty guy to call them beautiful suddenly because an amazing person to them.", "NTA. Miserable people want everyone to join them and they can't stand happy people.  Block her until she grows up.", "NTA. Affection and manners are the norm. Kids need to see that in various forms to understand that kindness, love, and affection look differently for different people. \n\nIt\u2019s super weird for a parent to not want their kids to be exposed to positive forms of affection. I mean, her kids and all but at least make it known that you don\u2019t want your kids to know what positive affection looks like. \n\nThe sister is just weird. Like those Uber conservative peeps that think kissing is a gateway to having children out of wedlock.", "NTA - Kids come up with this stuff all the time.

NTA....\n\nThat being said I don't think insecure is the right word. Does she plan to keep her daughter locked in her home with no tv or internet access for the rest of her life? People Kiss...

You sister is a little touched in the head....", "NTA\n\nNot only are you taking care of the kid (I'm assuming for free) but your niece is 8. Most shows/movies she watches are gonna have a kiss scene at this point. It's pretty obvious she is taking her frustration from her past relationship on you. Could you have handled it better? Probably.

Did you just shame an abuse victim?", "Everyone is kinda the arsehole here.\n\nShe definitely over reacted however she as a parent gets too choose what her kid sees and at what age. There is nothing wrong with her having that opinion but she ABSOLUTELY could have handled the situation better.", "ESH \n\nYour response was really extreme. She is clearly in the wrong, but knowing that her last relationship was toxic, you saying that \"if her daughter's parents weren't in love\" is really shitty to say. \n\nShe is obviously insecure and is still processing her toxic relationship and you should have de-escalated the situation instead of making it this huge scene.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your niece will see couples kissing out in public, even on child friendly TV shows. Not to mention a lot of Disney movies and fairytales have at least one kiss. Now if you were hard-core making out I could see your sister's viewpoint to a degree but if it was an occasional peck she needs to get over and realize couples kiss.", "NTA\n\nI kiss my husband \"good morning & good night\" as a minimum.....\n\n\nIf we visit my parents?

This is about \u201cDid you and Daddy separate because you never kissed?\u201d\n\nThe sister is probably questioning why her relationship failed, and feeling hurt, and lashing out. It sounds like she and her partner had issues for long enough that her daughter picked up on it, and what\u2019s really bothering her is the comparison between her failed relationship and OP\u2019s own.", "People who pay for childcare can, MAYBE, make demands like 'no affection should ever be shown, ever. '  \n\n\nPeople who are getting free daycare - not just free but from loving relatives that you trust -  cannot make such demands.   She cannot dictate to you how you show affection.   Provided you're not getting to third base in front of her kids - and obviously you're not - she has no gripe.  NONE.      \n\n\nBut it makes me wonder ... if a child - a child young enough to need a babysitter - has this insight about Sister's relationship - I mean - DUH!   Maybe Sis is frigid and cannot tolerate anyone enjoying physical affection.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister is upset because her child noticed that not only did your sister and the child's father not kiss they also didn't do the basic bare minimum of politeness by saying thank you or telling each other good bye. Your sister is jumping on you about the kiss but what about the child's other two observations? It would have seemed really crazy if she yelled at you and demanded you stop greeting each other and telling each good bye and using manners like please and thank you. So she jumped on the only thing she thought wouldn't seem batshit insane, the kiss, so now she will pretend like you two were making out in front of her kid.\n\nWhich was not you two making out, but a peck. I kiss my daughter on the cheek. My husband and I kiss a lot, not making out in front of people but a peck. It's just affection. Your sister thinks she can frame you kissing your boyfriend as something awful so she can be mad at you instead of having to examine or address the awful example her past relationship was setting to her daughter. She's being crazy and likely knows it but won't admit it publicly. I honestly don't know why it's so upsetting, the daughter knows they are divorced. Instead of using it as a teaching moment for her daughter she went on the attack instead. Which will also just teach her daughter that she can't talk about things like kissing to her mother without her mother freaking out, which is bad in a different way.", "NTA. Sounds like your niece cut Mommy a little close to the bone, and she decided to take it out on you.", "My stepsis is the no kissing around my kids period kind of parent. I think part of it was buying into homophobic rhetoric of \"grooming\" but then taking it to the point that she is fast forwarding kisses in Cinderella.

And she\u2019ll likely be back when she wants more free babysitting.", "No fr when I was 8 I was watching liked Ted lol", "I think insecure is probably the right word. I don\u2019t think what set the sister off is her child seeing a loving couple engage in an affectionate gesture, but that the child made a connection between that gesture, and the lack thereof leading to mommy and daddy separating. This could be part of the cause, or merely a symptom, but good on the kid for forming connections!  I think the sister feels insecure because of the comparison between the relationships, and it\u2019s easier for her to go \u201cthat\u2019s inappropriate!\u201d, and lash out at her sister for having several relationships, instead of admitting \u201cmy relationship lacked displays of healthy affection\u201d.", "No abuse involved, very rushed marriage, constant arguments, and her leaving their house for the silliest reasons just because they weren't able to communicate like adults. They were always on the verge of divorce, and she blamed everyone and everything around her for it.", "Eh. She's asking OP and partner to not show slight affection to each other while they are watching her child. Which means she shouldn't be allowing her kid to watch any show at 8 yrs old that has kissing in it. (lots of kids shows have parents that give pecks so) She is being a brat and taking her frustrations over her past relationship on OP and the mom.", "Of course she will! Haha", "Or most disney/fairytale movies have at least one kiss between couples.", "I fully get that but I think OPs reaction was over the top, she is allowed to control what her child sees for better or worse as a parent. If it makes her more comfortable to not have them kissing around her daughter for the sake of not creating an argument I personally would just do as she asks. I'm not saying I'm right necessarily it's just how I would act and my 2 cents on the issue.", "As long as the kid was not present during this argument - NTA.\n\nIf your sister's glass house is so fragile, she should not cast stones. She instigated this argument all over her own insecurities. Had she calmly approached you with concern, maybe you would not have given her a dose of her own medicine. But she chose vitriol.
