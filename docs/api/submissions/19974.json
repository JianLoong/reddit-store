He was patient, he didn\u2019t take me through anything too quickly and he slowly built my confidence to the point where I was almost at a normal heart rate before my lessons.\r\n\r\nSince 2010 we lived on a cul-de-sac, walkable distance to town centre (30min), leisure centre (20min), work (40min), bus stop (2min) and train station (30min). There was a corner shop about 5min walk away and two mini supermarkets about 20 mins away.\r\n\r\nIn Jan we had to move house (not our fault). I told my instructor I would have to put my lessons on pause.\r\n\r\nThe new place is in a village about 3miles from the town. It is a 2.5hour walk to work and there are no shops nearby. So I have been getting a lift to & from work most days, either from my dad or my partner(27m) who lives 1.5hour drive away but is self employed so does have work here. One of my coworkers/friends lives the other side of me and I am on her way to work. If I don\u2019t have a lift she will pick me up BUT this only works if I am not at a clients office. \r\n\r\nIt has been 4 months since we moved and I have just messaged my instructor because:\r\n- cost of living increase\r\n- I have a lot of studying at the moment with work and this is my current priority\r\n- less time due to commute\r\nHe said it would be a few weeks before he has space for me. \r\n\r\nI do have a car which came from a family member passing. One of my plans was to practice driving to work, but that requires someone with me and I don\u2019t feel confident yet driving without the second set of pedals that my instructor has. \r\n\r\nOn Friday dad invited some family friends round and they asked about me (I was upstairs packing to come to my partners for the weekend). He started talking about work and study etc but then he complained about how I can\u2019t drive yet. He told them about my car and how I \u201conly need to tax, insure it and pass the test\u201d and that I haven\u2019t sat in it yet (true, but reasons above). He goes on to say: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in my daughter\u201d. Next week my coworker is on holiday so I cannot rely on her for a lift. He said he will refuse to give me a lift and I need to tell work that I will be late/have to work from home (this would not be possible). I have looked at the bus timetable and it is 30min walk + 15 min bus ride, but I can either arrive an hour early or 15 mins late. I will be discussing with work on Monday which is best.\r\n\r\nSo my question is aita for not being able to drive yet? I hate that I am a burden but at the old house it really wasn\u2019t an issue.

I spent the first 26 years of my life in a small village and had to walk 4 miles to get to the nearest town because like you I couldn't drive. It took me an hour at most, usually about 52 - 55 minutes if I was in a good stride and not dawdling, and I did this in all weather's because I didn't want to rely on others (and realistically had no one to rely on because my mother also couldn't drive)\n\nIt's understandable in my book that you're anxious about learning to drive, and for that NTA HOWEVER if that is the case you really need to find a way to shift for yourself, either by getting on the shoelace express or riding a bike, rather than putting others out. At the moment I can see your family'a frustration because you're reliant on them to get around, and that puts a burden on them which is unfair.

There is suggesgion you're a slower learner (which is okay), and then you had to cancel lessons because you moved (Im not sure the issue here).\n\nUnfortunately, the reality is as long as other people have to drive you to work (and other places Im sure), you are somewhat of a burden - even if people tell you if is isn't a problem. \n\nYou're going to need this skill, you have a vehicle, and your family is willing to help and want you to do it.   \n\nGet it over with.

It opens up a new world.\n\nA lot of people are saying someone afraid of driving shouldn\u2019t be made to drive. Sure, I get that. But at the same time, being scared is reasonable. Driving can be dangerous. Most of the time it is not. I think if someone can get over their fears so they are not driving erratically, they can potentially be a very good driver because they understand it is a serious responsibility.", "Kinda yta, I'm 29 and only just passed my restricted driving test this year, mostly because I didn't have a car I inherited a car last year so didn't really have an excuse not to learn to drive anymore , the other reasons were due to anxiety and the fact I have known quite a few people close to me that have passed in car/bike accidents.  I eventually decided that I needed the independence to get myself around and out of the house after being diagnosed with hEDS and found walking was no longer doable . So I get the anxiety but it also doesn't seem like you have a reason to be so nervous and if you can't get over the anxiety you need to get a job closer to where you live know so you don't have to rely on others to get you to work .", "Another soft YTA here \u2026 but mainly to yourself. I put off learning how to drive till I was 35, i would have panic attacks, and the worst anxiety over it \u2026 looking back now after 5 years of driving I wish I had done it so much sooner. It\u2019s not that scary and once you gain confidence in your abilities it\u2019s actually really fun!

It seems it's a need you have where you live, it's not just something to use occasionally but more of an everyday thing. Go back to classes and maybe look into a psychologist so they can help you with your fear.\n\nPS; I was in a couple of accidents and cars freaked me out.

It's not normal to have that attitude to driving and now you can see the lack of driving license is seriously impacting your own life.\n\nPlenty of people drive out of pure necessity rather than for the love. You just need to pass your test.", "NTA - if you don't feel you should drive, then under no circumstances should you drive.

Not as scared as it sounds like you are,  but scared enough that I kept putting it off. (When I finally DID learn & get my license,  it was as if I had been given a set of wings! It was awesome! I was,  and still am,  a very cautious,defensive driver but the freedom of not relying on others is still a beautiful thing!  )\n\nNow, the people getting a little fed up with your dithering are also justified. Traveling by car is a necessity in your new location and you are inconveniencing others & making yourself unavailable for many routine tasks that you should be helping with at your age- you not driving means that you can't go to the grocery store, mail a parcel, pick up a prescription,  give your dad or partner a lift to a dentist appointment or a thousand other little things that involve getting behind the wheel. \n\nYou're not an AH but you do need to resolve this.", "YTA it seems like you have driving under control now so just take the damn test. What you could do is offer your dad to tag along as a passenger outside of working hours. Why do you need an instructor when you have your dad. Have you even tried it? Especially now that you've calmed your nerves. Also sound like you live in a small town. Driving conditions can't be that bad. Also 45 min to work is nothing. I currently have 1.5h one way. If you refuse to take the test then yes, live with the consequences and stop complaining and take the bus (also if you've got a job, why are you still living at home, i mean your 24 now)", "YTA I could kind of see the justification for not learning to drive when you were in your previous, non-driver friendly, living situation. \n\nHowever, when you moved to your current home you became completely dependent on others to drive you so that you can fulfill your responsibilities. You have caused considerable inconvenience to them. This is unsustainable, and you should have made learning to drive a priority as soon as you moved there. Your father is understandably fed up. The fact that you have a vehicle available to you only makes it worse. \n\nSo, yes, you have been selfish in not learning to drive because you are inconveniencing and burdening others by relying on them to do something that you should be doing for yourself.\n\nYou need to get this done ASAP so that you can gain independence and meet your obligations to others like your employer. I'm sure your father will help take you to the DMV to get any necessary permits. In most places, you don't have to have formal driving lessons but can have any licensed adult supervise you as you're learning. Get in your required hours behind the wheel and study and take your written test. If you have anxiety, you just have to force yourself to drive more frequently to overcome it. (I was driving when I had a major car accident and know it's possible to overcome this.) You are making this into a much bigger deal than it needs to be. Get it done.", "YTA. \n\nLife is literally full of things that are scary or that we (as people) do not want to do. The difference is that the vast majority of us can't be babied and have to find it in us to do things that terrify us, in the name of adulthood. \n\nGrow up and get on with it.

I realise I have perhaps been a bit blinkered to how much this affects the people around me. A couple of things I did not have space to mention in the post:\n- I do pay for my partners petrol, my dad gets a financial kickback another way due to certain household bills being paid by me and my friend will not accept money but I buy her drinks/food/gifts when I can to pay her back\n- one of the reasons it took so long for me to learn to drive is financial, my dad was out of work for a few years and I supported the household with a mediocre salary. As we have more income recently due to dad working part time and getting pay rises in my own role, I started learning but it\u2019s \u00a360 for a 2 hour lesson (I was having one every two weeks with my instructor before we moved) our rent increased by \u00a3125pm so initially I was not sure I could afford to continue, especially as moving itself brings additional costs (hiring a van, overlap rent etc) \n- I have done my theory test in May so I have made progress since moving even if it is not practical. I have been delaying getting in touch with my instructor so far as I am worried about money and thus far no one had raised any serious concerns with me so it was one of those things I just put to the back of my mind (I feel I should note if it was not clear that my dad was saying these things to the friends and I overheard, not directly to me)\n- although my nervousness around driving has come on leaps and bounds with my instructor, I am still quite far away practically from being able to take the test. I think it will still take me a few months as I have to learn all the manoeuvres and also how to do fast roads like dual carriageways etc\n- financially moving out is not an option at all right now. Rents here are ridiculous and we all know the housing market. I have no assistance for a deposit and my salary and circumstances would not get me the mortgage I needed, even for a shared ownership house (I have looked)\n\nMy short term plan is to get the bus to work. It will take me longer and I will have to adjust my working hours but it will mean I am not reliant on/burdening other people. I will also get my steps in walking to/from the bus stop so that will help me in other ways (I used to walk to and from work and I have really missed this both physically and mentally)\n\nMy long term plan is to discuss with my partner to make sure we can afford for me to take lessons more regularly. It would be a financial hit now but hopefully if I persevere I can pass my test sooner and be independent again. I am confident that with my current instructor I will be able to build my confidence and get over my fears.", "NTA. A person who is scared to drive should never be forced.", "NTA. Some people are not good drivers. I\u2019m one of them. I see things out of the corner of my eye that aren\u2019t there. I slam on the brakes for no reason. I hate driving.

I can get everywhere I need to go in my town quickly and can even haul groceries. Yes I\u2019m on the road with cars, but for me personally, it\u2019s not as scary.

See OP's comment on other factors. They are not in your situation. No one gets that. Saying \"learn to drive\" is easier said than done. You're so busy, and most of your money is tied up between you, your dad, and helping your partner. I want the privilege some people have of time, money, and resources because this isn't for everyone. And even cabs, Uber, and Lyft went up in price and are scarce in certain locations. Your dad is cruel as you are working, going to school, helping him, and he has to nerve to say he's disappointed? A lot of people don't drive. That shit is expensive. And with limited resources, they could lend you a hand. And you pay for your partner's gas and your dad's bills! You took the initiative to drive and then life got in the way. But you even have a backup plan so you don't have to rely on other people. Progress already! But these things happen. But the comments are so not helpful. \"just learn\" and \"Just get a bike\" like what? And then they say \"Oh, I don't drive because I got a reason, but shame on you because your reasons are not good enough\". SMDH. The fact that you're not confident scares me. DO NOT get in that car unless you are confident. After you do, you have to find the money to make sure the car is up to code, get everything you need from the town's rules on vehicles, find insurance, and more. But you sound tight in your budget already. It'll take time. It's not that you're not driving. It's that you're not driving YET.", "Nta but can't really say your dad is either when he's the one having to drive you out of his way.", "NTA. But you need to learn how to drive ASAP.

The main point is that while in retrospect it would have been useful to have gotten your full licence before you moved, you can't go back in time and make that happen, so all you can do is take charge of things moving forward. You might have to make your peace with arriving early at work when you catch the bus (can you take a book or a crossword or go and relax in a nearby cafe or library before your shift starts?

If so, you may not be able to learn to drive. And you'll have to learn to deal with that. I wish you good luck and hope your family and friends can be supportive emotionally if in no other way. And you adapt, if you can, to a non-driving life.", "Idk If I had an adult child and I was still expected to show for them everywhere around, I'd be a little disappointed too. Maybe not in the fact that they never learned how to drive, but definitely in the fact that they never figured out how to make sure that they got where they needed to go on their own. There's public transportation, there's walking, there's getting a bike, there's taxis, Uber, get a scooter, there's no excuses.", "She said she can\u2019t ride a bike either tho", ">I can\u2019t afford therapy right now\n\nThe NHS waitlist is long but you lose nothing by getting on it.", "I do shit I'm terrified of doing all the time. It's not an excuse to be using when you are hurting others.", "mine doesn't, UK based here", "This is so foreign to me, I was driving when I was 14-15 with my parent in the car and totally on my own at 16 and it was all the freedom in the world to me. Public transport doesn\u2019t exist and everything was miles away from home. \n\nI wonder what living in a place where you can walk or take public transportation is like lol", "Stolen comment from https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cf1o8/aita_for_not_learning_to_drive/jol9z36/", "She's NTA for being afraid, but she would be TA if she doesn't learn to manage her anxieties so she can overcome them. Right now, everyone else has to pay for her anxiety which is becoming a problem for her."]}
