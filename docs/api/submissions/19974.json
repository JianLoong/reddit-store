He was patient, he didn\u2019t take me through anything too quickly and he slowly built my confidence to the point where I was almost at a normal heart rate before my lessons.\r\n\r\nSince 2010 we lived on a cul-de-sac, walkable distance to town centre (30min), leisure centre (20min), work (40min), bus stop (2min) and train station (30min). There was a corner shop about 5min walk away and two mini supermarkets about 20 mins away.\r\n\r\nIn Jan we had to move house (not our fault). I told my instructor I would have to put my lessons on pause.\r\n\r\nThe new place is in a village about 3miles from the town. It is a 2.5hour walk to work and there are no shops nearby. So I have been getting a lift to & from work most days, either from my dad or my partner(27m) who lives 1.5hour drive away but is self employed so does have work here. One of my coworkers/friends lives the other side of me and I am on her way to work. If I don\u2019t have a lift she will pick me up BUT this only works if I am not at a clients office. \r\n\r\nIt has been 4 months since we moved and I have just messaged my instructor because:\r\n- cost of living increase\r\n- I have a lot of studying at the moment with work and this is my current priority\r\n- less time due to commute\r\nHe said it would be a few weeks before he has space for me. \r\n\r\nI do have a car which came from a family member passing. One of my plans was to practice driving to work, but that requires someone with me and I don\u2019t feel confident yet driving without the second set of pedals that my instructor has. \r\n\r\nOn Friday dad invited some family friends round and they asked about me (I was upstairs packing to come to my partners for the weekend). He started talking about work and study etc but then he complained about how I can\u2019t drive yet. He told them about my car and how I \u201conly need to tax, insure it and pass the test\u201d and that I haven\u2019t sat in it yet (true, but reasons above). He goes on to say: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in my daughter\u201d. Next week my coworker is on holiday so I cannot rely on her for a lift. He said he will refuse to give me a lift and I need to tell work that I will be late/have to work from home (this would not be possible). I have looked at the bus timetable and it is 30min walk + 15 min bus ride, but I can either arrive an hour early or 15 mins late. I will be discussing with work on Monday which is best.\r\n\r\nSo my question is aita for not being able to drive yet? I hate that I am a burden but at the old house it really wasn\u2019t an issue.

I spent the first 26 years of my life in a small village and had to walk 4 miles to get to the nearest town because like you I couldn't drive. It took me an hour at most, usually about 52 - 55 minutes if I was in a good stride and not dawdling, and I did this in all weather's because I didn't want to rely on others (and realistically had no one to rely on because my mother also couldn't drive)\n\nIt's understandable in my book that you're anxious about learning to drive, and for that NTA HOWEVER if that is the case you really need to find a way to shift for yourself, either by getting on the shoelace express or riding a bike, rather than putting others out. At the moment I can see your family'a frustration because you're reliant on them to get around, and that puts a burden on them which is unfair.

There is suggesgion you're a slower learner (which is okay), and then you had to cancel lessons because you moved (Im not sure the issue here).\n\nUnfortunately, the reality is as long as other people have to drive you to work (and other places Im sure), you are somewhat of a burden - even if people tell you if is isn't a problem. \n\nYou're going to need this skill, you have a vehicle, and your family is willing to help and want you to do it.   \n\nGet it over with.

It opens up a new world.\n\nA lot of people are saying someone afraid of driving shouldn\u2019t be made to drive. Sure, I get that. But at the same time, being scared is reasonable. Driving can be dangerous. Most of the time it is not. I think if someone can get over their fears so they are not driving erratically, they can potentially be a very good driver because they understand it is a serious responsibility.", "Kinda yta, I'm 29 and only just passed my restricted driving test this year, mostly because I didn't have a car I inherited a car last year so didn't really have an excuse not to learn to drive anymore , the other reasons were due to anxiety and the fact I have known quite a few people close to me that have passed in car/bike accidents.  I eventually decided that I needed the independence to get myself around and out of the house after being diagnosed with hEDS and found walking was no longer doable . So I get the anxiety but it also doesn't seem like you have a reason to be so nervous and if you can't get over the anxiety you need to get a job closer to where you live know so you don't have to rely on others to get you to work .", "Another soft YTA here \u2026 but mainly to yourself. I put off learning how to drive till I was 35, i would have panic attacks, and the worst anxiety over it \u2026 looking back now after 5 years of driving I wish I had done it so much sooner. It\u2019s not that scary and once you gain confidence in your abilities it\u2019s actually really fun!

It seems it's a need you have where you live, it's not just something to use occasionally but more of an everyday thing. Go back to classes and maybe look into a psychologist so they can help you with your fear.\n\nPS; I was in a couple of accidents and cars freaked me out.

It's not normal to have that attitude to driving and now you can see the lack of driving license is seriously impacting your own life.\n\nPlenty of people drive out of pure necessity rather than for the love. You just need to pass your test.", "NTA - if you don't feel you should drive, then under no circumstances should you drive.

Not as scared as it sounds like you are,  but scared enough that I kept putting it off. (When I finally DID learn & get my license,  it was as if I had been given a set of wings! It was awesome! I was,  and still am,  a very cautious,defensive driver but the freedom of not relying on others is still a beautiful thing!  )\n\nNow, the people getting a little fed up with your dithering are also justified. Traveling by car is a necessity in your new location and you are inconveniencing others & making yourself unavailable for many routine tasks that you should be helping with at your age- you not driving means that you can't go to the grocery store, mail a parcel, pick up a prescription,  give your dad or partner a lift to a dentist appointment or a thousand other little things that involve getting behind the wheel. \n\nYou're not an AH but you do need to resolve this.", "YTA it seems like you have driving under control now so just take the damn test. What you could do is offer your dad to tag along as a passenger outside of working hours. Why do you need an instructor when you have your dad. Have you even tried it? Especially now that you've calmed your nerves. Also sound like you live in a small town. Driving conditions can't be that bad. Also 45 min to work is nothing. I currently have 1.5h one way. If you refuse to take the test then yes, live with the consequences and stop complaining and take the bus (also if you've got a job, why are you still living at home, i mean your 24 now)", "YTA I could kind of see the justification for not learning to drive when you were in your previous, non-driver friendly, living situation. \n\nHowever, when you moved to your current home you became completely dependent on others to drive you so that you can fulfill your responsibilities. You have caused considerable inconvenience to them. This is unsustainable, and you should have made learning to drive a priority as soon as you moved there. Your father is understandably fed up. The fact that you have a vehicle available to you only makes it worse. \n\nSo, yes, you have been selfish in not learning to drive because you are inconveniencing and burdening others by relying on them to do something that you should be doing for yourself.\n\nYou need to get this done ASAP so that you can gain independence and meet your obligations to others like your employer. I'm sure your father will help take you to the DMV to get any necessary permits. In most places, you don't have to have formal driving lessons but can have any licensed adult supervise you as you're learning. Get in your required hours behind the wheel and study and take your written test. If you have anxiety, you just have to force yourself to drive more frequently to overcome it. (I was driving when I had a major car accident and know it's possible to overcome this.) You are making this into a much bigger deal than it needs to be. Get it done.", "YTA. \n\nLife is literally full of things that are scary or that we (as people) do not want to do. The difference is that the vast majority of us can't be babied and have to find it in us to do things that terrify us, in the name of adulthood. \n\nGrow up and get on with it.

I realise I have perhaps been a bit blinkered to how much this affects the people around me. A couple of things I did not have space to mention in the post:\n- I do pay for my partners petrol, my dad gets a financial kickback another way due to certain household bills being paid by me and my friend will not accept money but I buy her drinks/food/gifts when I can to pay her back\n- one of the reasons it took so long for me to learn to drive is financial, my dad was out of work for a few years and I supported the household with a mediocre salary. As we have more income recently due to dad working part time and getting pay rises in my own role, I started learning but it\u2019s \u00a360 for a 2 hour lesson (I was having one every two weeks with my instructor before we moved) our rent increased by \u00a3125pm so initially I was not sure I could afford to continue, especially as moving itself brings additional costs (hiring a van, overlap rent etc) \n- I have done my theory test in May so I have made progress since moving even if it is not practical. I have been delaying getting in touch with my instructor so far as I am worried about money and thus far no one had raised any serious concerns with me so it was one of those things I just put to the back of my mind (I feel I should note if it was not clear that my dad was saying these things to the friends and I overheard, not directly to me)\n- although my nervousness around driving has come on leaps and bounds with my instructor, I am still quite far away practically from being able to take the test. I think it will still take me a few months as I have to learn all the manoeuvres and also how to do fast roads like dual carriageways etc\n- financially moving out is not an option at all right now. Rents here are ridiculous and we all know the housing market. I have no assistance for a deposit and my salary and circumstances would not get me the mortgage I needed, even for a shared ownership house (I have looked)\n\nMy short term plan is to get the bus to work. It will take me longer and I will have to adjust my working hours but it will mean I am not reliant on/burdening other people. I will also get my steps in walking to/from the bus stop so that will help me in other ways (I used to walk to and from work and I have really missed this both physically and mentally)\n\nMy long term plan is to discuss with my partner to make sure we can afford for me to take lessons more regularly. It would be a financial hit now but hopefully if I persevere I can pass my test sooner and be independent again. I am confident that with my current instructor I will be able to build my confidence and get over my fears.", "NTA. A person who is scared to drive should never be forced.", "NTA. Some people are not good drivers. I\u2019m one of them. I see things out of the corner of my eye that aren\u2019t there. I slam on the brakes for no reason. I hate driving.

I can get everywhere I need to go in my town quickly and can even haul groceries. Yes I\u2019m on the road with cars, but for me personally, it\u2019s not as scary.

See OP's comment on other factors. They are not in your situation. No one gets that. Saying \"learn to drive\" is easier said than done. You're so busy, and most of your money is tied up between you, your dad, and helping your partner. I want the privilege some people have of time, money, and resources because this isn't for everyone. And even cabs, Uber, and Lyft went up in price and are scarce in certain locations. Your dad is cruel as you are working, going to school, helping him, and he has to nerve to say he's disappointed? A lot of people don't drive. That shit is expensive. And with limited resources, they could lend you a hand. And you pay for your partner's gas and your dad's bills! You took the initiative to drive and then life got in the way. But you even have a backup plan so you don't have to rely on other people. Progress already! But these things happen. But the comments are so not helpful. \"just learn\" and \"Just get a bike\" like what? And then they say \"Oh, I don't drive because I got a reason, but shame on you because your reasons are not good enough\". SMDH. The fact that you're not confident scares me. DO NOT get in that car unless you are confident. After you do, you have to find the money to make sure the car is up to code, get everything you need from the town's rules on vehicles, find insurance, and more. But you sound tight in your budget already. It'll take time. It's not that you're not driving. It's that you're not driving YET.", "Nta but can't really say your dad is either when he's the one having to drive you out of his way.", "NTA. But you need to learn how to drive ASAP.

But you shouldn\u2019t expect people in your house, or friends outside the house, to drop everything or make themselves available to drive you around when you need/want to go somewhere. Stick to Uber. If that\u2019s not convenient then you\u2019ll need to learn to drive or start walking everywhere", "I have to ask though, it's one thing not knowing how to drive, but... why not get a moped, scooter or bicycle while you're further away instead of having to rely on others?", "YTA. I have a cousin that was around your age when she HAD to drive. She grabbed the bull by the horns and got into it without hesitation. One sunday for learning all the basics and she was picking up her smaller siblings and running errands the next day. With a shitty manual transmission car.", "YTA it would be different if your choice not to drive did not impact others. You are at a point where you not driving is having a negative impact on your loved ones. You need to stop making excuses and make driving/being independent a priority. Stop relying and inconveniencing others.", "NTA, as an avid motorcycle rider and a truck driver I do not want u anywhere near a street driving for the reasons u indicated. Driving in itself is very simple however it can b very stressful and quick decisions often have to b made. At this point if u are terrified to drive u actually become a hazard on the road. Take your time, learn how to drive and handle situations properly. For example a construction zone and roundabouts. As long as u can make due currently stay the course. I respect what appears to b honesty and please do not rush into something ur not comfortable with. Best of luck to u", "YTA, sadly, that's an unavoidable conclusion.\n\nYou won't always have a second set of pedals to help you feel safe. If you're waiting for a time when you won't feel anxious, then that day will never come, because you are feeding your anxiety by letting it control your life \n\nOther people feel anxious about driving too, but you have to face that anxiety and beat it. \n\nFeel the fear, and do it anyway.\n\nAsk a (full licence) family member to sit beside you, and get in that car and drive!", "Don't be like my wife, who, despite years of promising she'd take lessons, still can't drive at the age of 42, and shows zero interest. She's reliant on buses, and lifts from me and her friends. I get frustrated, our children get frustrated as they see their friends' mums taking them places after school but I don't think she'll ever do it. We have the money for lessons, I bought her a car which she showed no interest in, and I ended up selling after it sat on the drive unused for six months.\n\nDriving is like cooking. It's a life skill that you should learn whether you want to or not. Especially if you live in a semi rural area like we do.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut since you can not drive yet, youi will have to take the bus. So one hour earlier it is.", "Move to London. No car needed", "YTA and it\u2019s not \u201csoft\u201d at all. \n\nYou\u2019re a burden to those around you and you\u2019ve decided to deprioritize driving lessons because you have other things you think are more important? Basically, you\u2019re entitled and think your time is what matters rather than everyone else\u2019s. Get over that entitlement. You\u2019re an adult so find a way. \n\nYou can choose to find a place near your work or bike to the nearest bus stop. Choosing to rely on others, then asking if you\u2019re an AH for doing so is immature frankly.", "Agreed. Less about not driving and more about expecting people to spend so much time serving as a personal chauffeur. It\u2019s so time consuming. I had an able-bodied 40-year-old colleague who asked for lifts often and it got to the point where it felt like having a little kid lol. They refused to walk, take the bus, order a ride share, ride a bike, etc. They had their elderly, disabled parents cart them across town to and from work most days.\n\nHopefully OP resolves this issue soon. People need to think about the long term. Those people offering rides won\u2019t always be able to or want to oblige.", "YTA, OP.  It sounds like driving is a critical life skill to have where you live.  You should either step up and learn it, or you can move someplace where walking/public transport is more feasible.  (If you can\u2019t afford to move, then learning to drive is it.)  It\u2019s not fair to pass this burden off to anyone else.  Also, always relying on others for transportation is not a good long-term plan.", "She\u2019s terrified of driving. You NEVER force someone who is afraid to drive.", "Checked the map and it\u2019s 5.5 miles door to door, closer to 2 hours walk so I was wrong, was basing it on walking home but that is not uphill and I never finish on time. Still a hefty increase on my prev 40min walk to work! I have put a comment up with my plans going forward which should hopefully take the pressure off everyone else :)", "I wouldn\u2019t put her down for her fears- I have accepted I will ever only get my license if it\u2019s absolutely necessary because I know I\u2019m too anxious of a person and I can\u2019t multitask. I literally hate driving with a passion. The issue is how she hasn\u2019t looked into public transportation before this\u2026 I\u2019m able to go without a license because where I live has great public transportation. She can get a bike and a lock to reduce the 30 minute walk and take the bus.", "She clearly says in her first sentence that she is terrified. That\u2019s more than reason enough.", "I agree with this but I do want to add: OP should really think long and hard about whether or not driving is something they want to do at all, and then plan accordingly.\n\nThe level of nervousness she\u2019s talking about here worries me about what kind of driver she may be, even if she passes the test. Nervous drives are often (unintentionally) very dangerous drivers.", "If in the UK you only have a limited period after taking the theory test to pass your practical so definitely worth progressing with the lessons. I'm a nervous driver as well but you will get there with a good instructor.", "Why not get a bicycle? It\u2019s only 5,5 miles, that\u2019s nothing on a bike.", "NTA. I hate seeing legit fears dismissed so flippantly, but appreciate that its hard to understand mental health issues if you don't have that experience. I'm a lot older than you, and don't drive. And it is becoming a burden on people in my life, and stopping me pulling my weight now my parents are aging and need me to step in and help them. I will be an asshole if i don't do what i can to fix this, but I'm not an asshole for not having the capacity to until now. \n\nPoverty is a bitch, and driving lessons, theory test, learner permits have been so far out of my budget I couldn't even think about them, let alone running and managing a car... even 100 quid for a parking space has never been an option. I chose to save my money for therapy, which is helping me deal with my fears, especially around childhood trauma of being driven around by a chronic alcoholic fearing for my life.\n\n I also thought i could avoid this by living near public transport until the housing/cost of living crisis. Don't judge yourself, be kind, and keep going, I'm proud of you for starting to address this, and looking forward to life opening up for both of us in the future.", "NTA\nI think you have a good plan worked out. I would definitely prioritise it as much as possible in your life. \nMaybe your BF can take you driving. You can start off slow. Even just once or twice around the block would be helpful. \nWhere I live there is no dual controls on any driving instructor vehicle so I'm sure you can manage to do something. Even sitting in a car, turning the engine on and off and rolling it up and down the driveway would be a good start. \nAlso - where I live - driving instructors often undermine your confidence by continually correcting what you're doing to make you feel more reliant on them for more lessons. \nFinally - do the test as soon as you can, even if you don't feel entirely ready. You might fail. Big deal. (I did the first time). But it made the second time so much easier. \nWhere I live if you are under 25 you have to do 120 hours of driving so people are just working on overdrive to can in a many hours as possible. I drive to a city 3 hours away and back multiple times to get my hours up. Maybe you can drive to your boyfreinds house sometimes. \nI'm sure you can do it. Just go for it.", "She could get a bicycle.", "I have anxiety and I didn't get my license until I was 25. During HS my anxiety was bad but I wasn't getting any help for it. Then I moved to a big city for uni and stayed there for years, and it wasn't until I moved back home that I actually needed to know how to drive. By that point I got on medication for my anxiety which made it a lot easier to learn how to drive. \n\nI'm pretty sympathetic to people who have trouble learning how to drive, and my honest suggestion is, if it's an anxiety issue like I have, to get therapy/medication for it. But regardless, if OP is living somewhere where a car is a must (and that's what it sounds like) and is physically/mentally/medically capable of driving then yes, she needs to suck it up and get on it, basically. It's not fair for her family or her partner to spend extra hours to drive her around. I mean, the fact that her partner lives 1.5h away but drives her sometimes? and she's not in a rush to get a license is pretty wild, that's just unsustainable.", "OP says there is no trauma about driving, just a fear of the unknown. Sometimes you have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations. I WAS her. Learning to drive was so terrifying that I literally couldn\u2019t cope halfway through a lesson, jumped out of a moving car and ran away. But you know what? I toughened up. I went back. I forced myself to go week in week out, because it is an important life skill. If OP wasn\u2019t relying on others for lifts and impacting their schedules, then fair enough. But she is and that isn\u2019t fair long term. \n\nYTA OP but at least you are willing to learn. Don\u2019t give up, push through the fear and I promise it will be worth it.", "I was uncomfortable with driving and didn\u2019t learn to drive until I was 26. But I lived in the city and was literally a ten minute walk from 3 different bus lines. I never had to inconvenience anyone else and when the bus wasn\u2019t running I took a cab or stayed with friends. But I planned ahead because I was the one without a license and it was MY responsibility to take care of my transport \n\nOp is TA. Because she was learning and was getting comfortable and chose to discontinue her lessons when she really needed them. Because she\u2019s expecting everyone else to do for her. Because she just assumed everyone would be happy to just continue doing for her with no end date or solution in sight", "I was also afraid to learn to drive but I did when I was 16 anyway because my parents made me. Then I realized it wasn\u2019t so scary. \n\nEveryone is afraid of doing something new and unknown and coddling that fear is detrimental", "Get a bicycle.", "It's not though, is it? Sometimes you have to do things you're scared of to function as an adult, and avoid burdening those around you. This is one of those times. Being scared isn't a reason to not do something, you just have to do it scared.", "I'm a 27f and I don't drive because of this. My eyesight is horrible even with my glasses and I would never, ever want to put others in danger to drive. My autism diagnosis came late in my life, but I think that's a big part of it too, tbh. I am not like OP, though. I don't trouble anyone to pick me up. I can get around without disturbing anyone else's time.", "That would work, too.", "Exactly. Most people are scared at first. Or scared still! Driving is a huge responsibility and can be dangerous! But life is dangerous.

Cycling is so much quicker and more fun, imho, if you have  a safe route.", "Driving when you're shrouded in anxiety is a recipe for disaster. I'm serious. Driving instructors will say driving while you're that scared is as bad as driving impaired or driving extremely tired. It isn't safe. I don't drive and get around great. OP needs to figure out how to do that, but they are not TA for being too scared to drive."]}
