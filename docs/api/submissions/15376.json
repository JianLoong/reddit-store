I\u2019m getting married to my fianc\u00e9 (M26) in the fall. Something about me, I really really love birthdays. I always have. I love having cake, opening presents, feeing loved by my people, all of that birthday jazz. I really love celebrating other people\u2019s birthdays too. I take a lot of time and energy (NOT necessarily money) to find great gifts for people. \nThe thing is, we\u2019re super broke this year and have been busy busy busy. I understand that money is tight and that life happens quickly but I was disappointed with my birthday gift this year. \nHe got me flowers, which was really sweet. However, that\u2019s all I got. When I asked if he had more for me downstairs, he smiled and said no. His reasoning was that he doesn\u2019t have as much money this year as he has had before and that he couldn\u2019t figure out what to get me. My response was that if he was at Kroger to buy me flowers, I couldn\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t see something there that reminded him of me or he could\u2019ve bought my favorite candy. Just SOMETHING. He hasn\u2019t  been acting the same since and has been kind of ignoring me, so I\u2019ve been wondering if what I said made me an asshole.\n\nEDIT\nokay I get it. \nA lot of you think I\u2019m a spoiled brat. However, there seems to be several misunderstandings. I should\u2019ve communicated more in my OP. I did say thank you for the flowers, I thanked him profusely. I like flowers, it was a kind gesture. I\u2019m floored that there are so many people that think that the very bare minimum (I.e. REMEMBERING my birthday) is acceptable in an equal partnership. TO CLARIFY: I was upset about the lack of effort, not the lack of monetary value. Money is not the world to me, I love him so much and I try so hard to make him happy. I just want him to show that he cares about me and wants me to be happy by taking a few minutes to consider what might be a good gift for me. The amount of people attacking me based on a few sentences is wild.", "created_utc": 1682114418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uk0dz/aita_for_speaking_up_about_my_birthday_gift/", "score": 224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Assuming your partner knows how important birthdays are to you, this would\u2019ve been the time to come up with literally anything homemade or inexpensive.

He could have said that he doesn't have money for anything non-essential and he'd have to get you an extra special gift next year.  He still managed to get you something and you made it clear that it wasn't good enough for you.  Congratulations.  You probably won't get a gift from him again unless he can go all-out because why would he make an effort when it won't be appreciated.", "NAH honestly, I can understand both POVs", "YTA. Next time say thank you.", " NAH. It\u2019s okay for you to feel hurt because this is something you assess love with. It\u2019s okay for him to simply suck at being a good gift giver. I suck at it too and I\u2019ve learned that the best way to go about this is to express my love for the person while warning them about my abysmal gift giving skills. Just have a conversation with your husband, tell him it\u2019s not the monetary value but you feeling unloved.", "YTA. What you said was objectively rude af and extremely ungrateful. You're not entitled to gifts. Not everyone enjoys giving gifts, and not everyone is good at it either - if you want something specific, you should let it be known. Otherwise just be thankful for what you have.", "YTA. He remembered it was your birthday, went to the store and bought you flowers. That was his present, it was the best he could do this year, money is tight.  This may not be the only time in your life when there are money issues. It's nice to have an understanding during those times.", "Yep YTA. He did get you something because he was thinking of you and did pull money out of a tight budget to let you know you are cherished. And you complained immediately. I would also be less than happy about that.", "YTA. You are not entitled to anything on your birthday. People that love you choose to celebrate it. In this case, he got you some nice flowers, and your immediate reaction was \u201cIs that it?\u201d \n\nGive me a break.", "YTA\n\nNot everyone sees birthdays as the huge ordeal you do.\n\nHe did go to a store to buy you something, telling him he should have bought you candy too is a little weird.  I mean, when would it be enough.\n\nHe was right not to overspend if he\u2019s broke, there shouldn\u2019t be an expectation of him going into to debt to buy you something that you most likely don\u2019t really \\*need\\*.", "My husband and I don\u2019t give each other birthday or Christmas presents.

I also know the things he absolutely hates to do that I don\u2019t mind doing, so I do those things for him (laundry) and he does the things I hate (talking to the insurance company). He\u2019ll take my car to be detailed while I\u2019m napping or in a work project.

FYI he's ignoring you because he went to the trouble (and expense at a time by when by your own admission money is SUPER tight) and you made him feel like crap.  Honestly you don't sound mature enough to be getting married.", "Flowers ARE something!", "YTA - It's very rude to get a gift and say \"Thanks but is that all you got me?\"", "Info.  Did you have a birthday cake at all?  Cake and a loved one is all you need for a great birthday.", "YTAish, I can see why disappointed. But not everyone puts the same stock in birthdays as you do so isn't fair to hold others to those standards.\n\nMaybe think of it this way.\n\nIn keeping things simple for your birthday and not going all out, he is showing you just how much he wants to marry you and give you an amazing wedding. If you think of the sentiment behind that decision, it was a great gift.", "NTA. Honestly, flowers are okay, but he could have easily written you a love letter or done something for you that doesn't cost money or something.", "NTA because I really think you don't care about the money but the thought. If he had gotten you some candy and drew you a stick figure picture of the story of your relationship or something I think you would have been happy. I also love birthdays. It's not a present related thing but I enjoy feeling loved and cared for on that day. I dont know how your conversation with him went down but it's a bit rude for him to ignore you. I would try to hash this out and explain what parts mean a lot to you. It's the thoughtfulness not the money.", "Soft YTA. \n\nIt sounds like in the past he made more effort and spent more. But this year it just didn\u2019t happen. Did you at least do something for dinner? If he\u2019d forgotten your bday altogether that\u2019d be one thing.. \n\nIf I was you, I\u2019d have smiled at the flowers, thanked him, and let it go. In the future when money and schedules allowed I\u2019d be hopeful for more tho.

I understand being disappointed, but what you said was rude.", "YTA.\n\nYou said yourself you guys are pretty broke this year, why would you be so entitled as to ask for a gift? I personally love my birthday as well, and understand the excitement behind opening presents, but the fact that your fiance made the effort to buy you something despite his incredibly tight budget is more valuable than any other gift. If I were in your position, I would value those flowers so much. I can't wrap my head around the fact that not only were you not appreciative of his efforts, you also asked if there was anything else, and when he said no, you started an argument because you just couldn't believe he didn't get you something else.", "YTA\n\nSentiment over materialism, always. When you care more about him than you do about you, then you are ready for \"in sickness and in health\". Good luck.", "YTA and selfish, you just said that you don\u2019t \u201cnecessarily spend (lots) of money\u201d for other birthdays, so do not expect the same in return. He told you he\u2019s strapped and he was kind/loving enough to get you flowers. He still acknowledged and got you a gift on your birthday, that is feeling the \u201clove\u201d from your people. If you can\u2019t realize that than I\u2019m gonna go ahead and assume you\u2019re the self absorbed type that thinks little gestures aren\u2019t good enough for your selfish ass. I hate flowers and if my partner brought me flowers, I\u2019d be happy because it\u2019s a kind gesture.", "YTA. Not a harsh yta but you are. He admitted money is tight, so he tried. You could spend years with a man and he won\u2019t be able to figure out a gift if the money is tight because he wants to give you the world, but cant. When men only want to give you the most, they never think about how to give you the least. So they get stumped when thinking of what to get us when they dont have much money. So try to appreciate he came up with something. Sometimes they think so long and hard you end up with nothing. But he figured something out. Show you care", "YTA. He acknowledged your birthday with flowers, you said you\u2019re broke, so yeah you\u2019re being an asshole by whining about not getting anything else. You have the right to \\*feel\\* however you like, but lashing out at someone you know is broke because they ONLY bought you birthday flowers AS AN ADULT is really childish behavior on your part.", "YTA for not thanking him first, and for the way you communicated. Instead of actually explaining what you needed from him (demonstrating \u201cmore effort\u201d) or why it was important to you, you criticized him and essentially looked down on him (you \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t XYZ\u201d). \n\nI think you owe him an apology. From there you can try explaining where you\u2019re coming from, and maybe listen to his perspective as well.", "YTA He thought about you. This year is tight because of the upcoming wedding. But he did think about you and you basically threw the flowers back in his face. I'd be ignoring you too.", "YTA and may be the reason you\u2019re both broke with your nonsense!", "YTA\n\nYou love everything about birthdays except being grateful for what you get. \n\nBuy yourself what you want. Money is tight. Treat yourself if you want more. \n\nIt\u2019s supposed to be the thought that counts.", "YTA\n\nYou're not entitled to gifts, but it sounds like you think you should be. Your partner got you a gift, and it was flowers. Those aren't cheap! You may not like the gift you were given (though you say you do like getting flowers), but it's really rude to ask if there's more. \n\nNext time, tell your partner what you want instead of being so insulting and asking if there's more... they can't read your mind, and you obviously have ideas about what you feel is a suitable gift.", "NTA you just wanted to be thought of and made special by the man who loves you", "YTA.  You aren't 6 years old.  Birthdays aren't a big deal for adults.  You got a gift.   Grow up.", "This is a grey one, I can see both sides. But I would tend to say NTA, I'm more like you as I love birthdays too, esp when you find the perfect gift for someone, my favorite thing is to watch them open it! Flowers, imo, are the worst gift because they are temporary and don't serve a purpose - unless combined with something. It does seem like an easy out, but on the other side, at least he remembered your birthday so... \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA\u2026 I think your love language might be receiving gifts. And hence the disappointment. I think you and your fianc\u00e9 need to talk about this and how gifts are important to you and your expression of feeling loved. \nI will however tell you something\u2026sometimes a persona can have only 100$ and they get you a 25$ dollar bouquet\u2026and at another moment they might have 1000$ and get you 25$ bouquet. The difference is in how in one case someone spent probably more than they can afford and relatively it might not be a lot of money\u2026but for that person in that scenario it\u2019s a lot! \nHopefully this helps you see value in his action.\n\nHighs and lows are part of life\u2026don\u2019t let go of the birthday joy and spirit. Hopefully love compensates for other stuff.", "NAH. I totally get the disappointment. You didn't want anything extravagant, just something that shows he cares. But as someone who is terrible at on-demand gift giving, I also appreciate that having a perfect gift on a specific date isn't always easy. My nearest and dearest have learned that they might get nothing more than a good wish on birthdays or holidays, but I won't hesitate to give the perfect gift on some other totally random day when the right idea hits me.", "NTA. Flowers are the most thoughtless and generic gift possible. Say the bouquet was $15; he could have spent that same $15 on a pretty notebook and heartfelt card and you\u2019d have been much happier. People are saying \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d but literally the only thought he had was \u201cit\u2019s her bday, I better get her something, ummm flowers I guess? Sure.\u201d If all the people saying YTA would be happy with the same gift he\u2019d get for his mother, sister and any ex girlfriends when he was out of ideas, that\u2019s on them. You wanted something he put effort into and didn\u2019t get it, of course you\u2019re disappointed.", "NTA. There are tons of things he could have done for next to no money that would have made you feel thought of. Heart felt note, homemade coupon book for massages etc, he could have done a picnic and given you the flowers there. It\u2019s not about money it\u2019s about the effort and thoughtfulness.", "NTA. But let him know how it made you feel, and tell him what you expect for your birthday so it doesn't happen next year. Communication is key.", "NTA- I\u2019d be a bit miffed if my partner got me flowers- they\u2019re about \u00a32-10 where I\u2019m from. He could have gotten you a cute notebook (usually \u00a35-20 where I\u2019m from, so not much in it) or come up with something free and fun for you to do together. Saying \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of anything\u201d is lazy, and suggests he knew the gift was a bit naff.", "Going against the grain here with ESH. You could\u2019ve handled this more tactfully- he did remember your birthday and get your flowers. However, I understand where you\u2019re coming from too. I would at least expect a card with something nice and thoughtful written in it.", "NAH.  Making a big deal about birthdays is important to you.  That\u2019s how you show love to other people and how you feel loved and valued.  So when your fianc\u00e9 got you flowers and no other gift, you probably felt devalued.  But making a big deal about birthdays and choosing gifts might not equal love to your fianc\u00e9.  In his mind, maybe he was showing you love by buying flowers and saving money toward your future, since he couldn\u2019t afford to get you a really \u201cspecial\u201d gift.  \n\nWhile I think it\u2019s a little tacky to ask \u201cis there more?\u201d, I don\u2019t think either of you are AHs.

The first 2 sentences scream nothing but pure self-centeredness and entitlement.  YTA", "NTA. In my experience flowers are a phone-it-in gift for when you can't be bothered to find an actual gift. If money was an issue he could have made you something. It's the thought that counts and it frankly seems like he didn't put any thought in at all.", "NTA! I don't think you're spoiled at all. You weren't expecting a diamond bracelet just a bit more thought. Jeez a handmade voucher for a foot rub or something would have been nice", "Thoughtfulness.", "What's ungrateful is a partner that doesn't try on your BIRTHDAY. a letter of love is FREE. Flowers are thoughtless, it's a cop out. You can give almost anyone Flowers. \n\nBreakfast in bed, or a romantic home cooked dinner, or a day centered around her and doing things she wants to do... it sounds like he just got a bouquet and called it a day. Where is the effort? Effort costs nothing.", "If your partners love language is gift giving you can put effort into getting a meaningful gift once a year. \"I'm not good at that so I got you flowers\" is not being a good partner lol.", "Oh hun, I think these people just haven't been in actual relationships. I'm married. My husband was terrible with birthdays, despite me putting an ENORMOUS amount of effort into his!! I made him candy baskets, I cooked him food, I wrote cards, and anything else I could think of, money or not! \n\nAt the beginning, he didn't try at all. He said he would buy me a gift when he got paid later in the week... he told me the day of my birthday. We had to have a real conversation about how much it hurt that he did that bc I always put so much effort into his days. And now, he's great at it! He's learned how to communicate if we're in a tight spot, and even if he doesn't have money, he makes the day special. \n\nIf I only got flowers, I would have said the same thing!! \n\nIt's a learning curve..it hurts, but if you express your feelings and he's receptive to it, you'll have to just hope for better next year. Hopefully you grow together through this experience.", "Man if I was getting married to someone and they did this... I'd be sad. Broke isn't an excuse to not plan. Make her a nice dinner and have a movie marathon on netflix. Light some candles and run a bath. Write a love letter. Make a jar of reasons he loves her. I took my ex on vacation for his birthday. I got grocery store flowers and that's it. Yea it didn't last.", "Well I'm glad that op is a 7 year old that got a toy she didn't want on her birthday and threw a tantrum. Oh? That's not what's happening? I couldn't tell from the way you worked this. \n\nThey are about to get married. Flowers are a good gift if you're still learning about someone. If you've known them for years, you should know if they don't LOVE LOVE flowers, it's a shitty gift. \n\nShe said even CANDY would have been fine. Just her favorite candy. \n\nHad the man who claims to love her put in a modicum of effort, i doubt this post would be here. Notice how the only thing mentioned that he did AT ALL for her BIRTHDAY was buy her flowers. Where's a card? A letter expressing your love that she can keep forever is free. \n\nObv. Finances are expected to celebrate their SOs birthday. He couldn't communicate that he wasn't sure what to do, given their money situation?? And if you think it was her job to ask him about her birthday plans that are usually a surprise... why?", "She said thank you, and When there was no follow up on his end for anything else, asked, \"is that it?\" \n\nWhich is a solid question. Where's the romance? We don't know the flowers were nice. He doesn't have money, they were probably the cheapest he could find at the store. And she didn't mention they were her favorite, so I doubt there was thought into the flowers. He could have, for the same price, gotten her some of her favorite candy. He could have made her breakfast in bed and spoiled her all day..could have asked her what's something fun she would want to do at home. If He could only do flowers, why not warn her ahead of time? Why not ask the birthday girl what she wants for her birthday? And then have a realistic conversation that while he can't do much with money, he wants to make the day good for her. \n\nIf im marrying someone - im entitled to them caring about something i care about! Like my fucking birthday!! Give ME a break with these childish ass responses.", "If you ONLY got flowers, and no other gesture, would you feel the same? \n\nOne small kind gesture is something I expect from my fiance any day. On my birthday, I'd want a bigger gesture. And NO That doesn't mean a monetary gesture. There are plenty of free, thoughtful things he could have planned. Instead he copped out on flowers and thought that would be enough. \n\nIt's not about the money.", "He did the bare minimum and you think the money is what she's upset about? Your reading comprehension is off. \n\nShe said she didn't care about money. She would have been fine with her fave candy. I'm sure a letter or a card, breakfast in bed, or literally anything that shows he loves her. She has confirmed in the comments she would have liked anything else with thought and no more monetary value then he spent on the flowers. \n\nFlowers are a gift for people that don't know eachother well. There are a rare few people that genuinely love flowers, and if he knew she fucking LOOOOVVEESSS flowers, it's a good gift. But she doesn't. She's okay with flowers, they are nice, but it's not thoughtful at all. It's a very generic, quick \"I saw this at the store and this is a good default present\" they weren't even her favorite flowers. Just a bouquet. \n\nShe wanted to feel special and loved. Where is that in his gift?", "So because you have low expectations everyone else has to as well??", "My comment might get buried, but it sounds like a miscommunication of love languages. I would definitely recommend you read about the 5 Love Languages. It's something my husband and I read and discussed before we got married, and it really helped!\n\nNAH", "And is that what you focussed on conveying rather that he didn't buy something else. From your OP it sounds like you emphasised he didn't buy you more rather than he didn't do something extra thoughtful, say make breakfast/a cake because the effort shows he cared.\n\nI think you need to apologise but explain it wasn't monetary value you want but thoughtfulness.", "This is what he heard\u2026 \u201cThank you for the flowers\u2026 what else did you get me?\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s second guessing if he should marry you, I\u2019m betting.", "Exactly! I'm broke right now, but I've just realized that my fiance's love language is gifts, and I'm a decent enough artist, so I've decided I'm going to make him a little book, with nice art paper, tied in ribbon, and I'm going to calligraph and illustrate each page. \n\nThe first 10 pages will be \"10 good things (that I love about you)\" because he once told me that it takes 10 positive statements to overcome one negative statement in the human mind. \n\nThe next im-not-sure-how-many pages are going to be personalized \"love vows\" including both phrases from traditional wedding vows all over the world, and personal ones like \"I will always try to remember that you like a glass of milk with your pb+js.\"\n\nCost: $0 as I already have the paper, ribbon, colored pencils and markers. When people say it's the thought that counts... That's really true! It's the THOUGHT, the TIME and the ENERGY/EFFORT that really makes something meaningful.\n\nOP, you are NTA. He could have done better, and you were not unkind in your disappointment.", "Flowers ain't even cheap. You can buy something more meaningful with 10$ than flowers.", "Yes, this!", "That's so lovely. My fianc\u00e9e made me a little photo album and played music while we danced for our anniversary. It was the sweetest thing, I've kept it in a little box.", "Flowers are so low effort. It sounds like that's all she got on her special day. What about a stay in date where he cooks for her? Bakes her a cake? Gets her a card with a handwritten note, or a letter??? \n\nFlowers are a nice gesture, but if you're low on cash, any other gesture that costs the same amount would have been more personal and loving.", "Maybe think for a moment", "Absolutely no one brought up abuse you weirdo", "Awh \u2764\ufe0f that's adorable! And thank you! I'm still sort of pre-planning but I'm really excited about making it!\n\nOne year for my birthday he gave me a little medicine pouch that he'd filled with heart shaped rocks and little mementos of that year together - there was like, a bottle cap from the beer we shared at a concert, a tiny piece of driftwood from our favorite beach, a lil picture of us, a bunch of little things like that. It was amazing and like ofc I am keeping that forEVER!!\n\nAll these people here thinking OP is hung up on money are totally missing the point, I think.", "Also, I really love your username! Mind if I steal the idea and draw some?", "He might have been planning to make her a nice dinner or something, but she didn't wait that long before deciding he'd fucked up. She didn't even wait to get downstairs she had to ask \"is this it?\".", "But then she said if he would have gotten her her favourite candy she would be happy. That\u2019s also super low effort? How is that different from flowers?", "Flowers are a generic gift. He didn't pick out her favorite flowers. He just picked some up at the store and called it a day. You really shouldn't give flowers to somebody you're super super close with unless you know that they LOOOVEEE flowers. All the girls I know like flowers, but would certainly not prefer them to any other cheap gift you can get. They die in a few days anyways.\n\nAND She said her FAVORITE candy. If he had gotten her random candy that she was ok with but didnt care for much, that would be just as bad. It shows he remembers what she likes, and put some thought into it. He could have also written her a birthday card with a sweet love message that she could keep forever. He could have done anything other than flowers.", "Because they're a generic cop out gift 99% of the time. Now if it was personalised, like her favourite flowers or something, theres effort because you had to remember her favourite ones and specifically find them. However if it was just a random bunch of flowers that he grabbed during a shop, there's literally 0 effort there. \n\nIt's the same with the candy, finding her favourite candy and buying it is effort because again, he would have to remember what it is and go out of his way to buy it."]}
