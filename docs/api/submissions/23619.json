If you have in mind to \"share\" the inheritance with him, I suggest you think long and hard and come up with a figure and offer that to him on condition that he not ask again in the future.  That way it's a clean cut.  If he squanders it then that is his problem.  You are not obligated to do this, but it may be a bit easier than dragging this drama out over years.  If you do this I suggest you get in in writing with lawyers. \n\nGood luck", "NTA - he still has two parents to inherit from.  Your father's family's money is not for him to use as he wishes.

He will ALWAYS be asking for more.", "NTA - He sounds like an absolute irresponsible leech and would totally blow away any money you give him.  \nThe most responsible thing that you can do is to NOT give him any share of  your money and moving forward, he needs to situate himself better so that he's not in debt every month.  Sounds like Freelancing is not working for him, probably cause he is so irresponsible.  So he needs to get his shit together and go get a job instead.

I would tell him we're going to work on a budget together to his finances in order. Then I'll help for 6 more months so he has time to get better work. After that he needs to pay his own bills.

You're getting the money tangled up in complicated ways that you're not understanding fully. At that point, just write him a check and give him the money.\n\n> Anyway, now he explains that he is in dire need of money, that I don't understand his struggles because he always stresses to pay his rent and needs and I don't.

That's great.  But *do not* keep bleeding money to him without a plan.  Cut him off.  If you are subsidizing his lifestyle now, pick a reasonable amount of time to keep a steady level of funding (e.g. 3-6 months), and tell him that after that, you will be ceasing sending him money.  Give him an opportunity to make plans, find a job, whatever, but stop just funneling your cash to him. \n\nYou sound completely overwhelmed with the money.
