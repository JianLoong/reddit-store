My dad raised him, and eventually, my dad wanted to adopt Matt and for that, he had to ask permission from Matt's biological dad. Matt's dad refused on the belief that my dad wanted to change Matt's last name.  \nSadly when we were teenagers my dad passed away, and by having non-married parents and being an only child for the law, I inherited my dad's house, a flat and a piece of land.  \nMy dad himself was an only child so when his mom passed away I inherited half of my grandparent's assets. 21 months ago my grandpa passed away and I inherited the rest of my grandparent's assets, meaning that I have another house, lands for agriculture and money in a bank account.  \nThat being said my sibling started to talk to me about the money and how I should invest it and what to do with it. What I did was pay for my studies with it, and thanks to that I could graduate this May, I also used it to repair my childhood house so my mom will stop living in a non-sain house. My house was nice to me but after remodelling and changing the inside features I notice that we were living in a poor environment. Anyways I used this money to pay for my studies which I need to continue for another two years. I also now have to fix and repair the other house, while doing this I give money to my brother when he has a hard time and life is difficult for him.  \nMy brother is a freelancer, so more often than I like, he is struggling. When he struggles he does odd jobs which help him finish the month and pay for his needs as apparently his main job is not enough.  \nFollowing this you have to know that in the past 21 months he made me start crypto which to this date I'm still not comfortable using so my account is set so he would stop pestering me. I also tried to create a business with him so I'd put all my money into it and buy a flat with my brother so he could have a home, the plan was that I would leave the business so he would be in charge. The bank refuse to let us have a loan, so the project failed. Anyway, now he explains that he is in dire need of money, that I don't understand his struggles because he always stresses to pay his rent and needs and I don't. Because of that, he wants me to give him a third of what I have in my account because this money comes from my dad and my dad raised him so he is as much legit as me.  \nSo AITA for not wanting to give my brother a third of what I have in my bank account but instead wants to help him here and there?", "created_utc": 1690877803, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f66r7/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_sibling_about_giving_him/", "score": 21, "replies": ["You could of half all the inheritance but chose not to YTA", "NTA\n\nSounds like he keeps pressuring you to waste your money.

So, morally you should prob give that money to your brother, who it\u2019s apparent you love. But if you do this, it should be on the condition that you will not be giving him any more money. If he blows it, it\u2019s on him and he should not ask for more. Legally you are not obligated to give him any money.

I get that legally there's nothing he can do, but in a moral sense, if i had two children, regardless of them being adopted or blood related or not, if i had raised them, i'd see them as equals to my inheritance. I get what you mean though. its just a tricky topic overall.", "Ok thank you for clarifying. The way I read your original comment was confusing, I thought you meant he should have been given an inheritance by whoever passes down the estate to next of kin. I think from OP's comments that he will be heavily taxed if given money,  possibly property too. He doesn't seem to be very good with money but at minimum I'd want my brother to have a place to live and figure out how to give money for property taxes in small enough amounts it wouldn't be flagged."]}
