He  he continued to make negative little comments about her to my son. What put me over the edge was as he was leaving he made it a point to come back into the house, call out my sons name and say \"maybe your sister will grow a ding dong\". \nI said \"No, she's a girl and if you don't like it, you won't be around\". \nI grew up with a grandparent who blatantly favored the boys over us girls. We were nothing to her, so it broke my heart to hear this about my unborn daughter. Literally bawled my eyes out the rest of that night.\nThe week after that he stopped over uninvited/unannounced and demanded to speak to me. (Husband told his mother how upset we were with all his negative comments and how I grew up with that.) I tried to avoid him, but he came up to me and said \"what, you're not going to talk to me?\" I replied \"I have nothing nice to say to you\". He says \"wow really?\" I repeated \"I have nothing nice to say to you right now\". He lost his shit. Started calling me a F***ing B**** and how I'm \"showing my true colors\". I continued to repeat \"I have nothing nice to say to you\" (mind you, my toddler is on my hip the entire time this man is cussing and berating me). \nNow I'm livid. We haven't seen him in over 2 months as he hasn't been welcome at our house.( He also sent a letter a week later stating my husband and son are no longer patients at his medical practice).\nMIL has only seen our son twice since, because  she \"feels bad\" seeing him when her husband can't. He denies doing anything wrong, luckily my husband heard EVERYTHING.l\nAnyway, MIL asked my husband what we wanted for our son for Christmas so he sent her a link to one of those indoor wooden climbing gyms for toddlers. We thought it would be perfect for him to stay active during winter and when the new baby arrives. My husband attended his family's Christmas (son and I did not go) but his mother would not let him bring the gift home for our son, saying \"I want to give it to him\". \nTotally cool, I completely understand that. We invite her over to our house for Christmas eve, she won't come. She decided (because FIL went out of town) to come over just the other day. My husband asks where the wooden gym was and she says \"I want your father to be there and give it to him too\". \nNeither my husband or MIL want to tell this man he's in the wrong. I honestly don't see anything changing in the near future, so I ordered the climbing set myself. It comes in next week. \nAITAH?", "created_utc": 1704216362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wusus/aitah_for_buying_a_gift_for_my_son_that_i_had/", "score": 337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
