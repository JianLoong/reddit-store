He  he continued to make negative little comments about her to my son. What put me over the edge was as he was leaving he made it a point to come back into the house, call out my sons name and say \"maybe your sister will grow a ding dong\". \nI said \"No, she's a girl and if you don't like it, you won't be around\". \nI grew up with a grandparent who blatantly favored the boys over us girls. We were nothing to her, so it broke my heart to hear this about my unborn daughter. Literally bawled my eyes out the rest of that night.\nThe week after that he stopped over uninvited/unannounced and demanded to speak to me. (Husband told his mother how upset we were with all his negative comments and how I grew up with that.) I tried to avoid him, but he came up to me and said \"what, you're not going to talk to me?\" I replied \"I have nothing nice to say to you\". He says \"wow really?\" I repeated \"I have nothing nice to say to you right now\". He lost his shit. Started calling me a F***ing B**** and how I'm \"showing my true colors\". I continued to repeat \"I have nothing nice to say to you\" (mind you, my toddler is on my hip the entire time this man is cussing and berating me). \nNow I'm livid. We haven't seen him in over 2 months as he hasn't been welcome at our house.( He also sent a letter a week later stating my husband and son are no longer patients at his medical practice).\nMIL has only seen our son twice since, because  she \"feels bad\" seeing him when her husband can't. He denies doing anything wrong, luckily my husband heard EVERYTHING.l\nAnyway, MIL asked my husband what we wanted for our son for Christmas so he sent her a link to one of those indoor wooden climbing gyms for toddlers. We thought it would be perfect for him to stay active during winter and when the new baby arrives. My husband attended his family's Christmas (son and I did not go) but his mother would not let him bring the gift home for our son, saying \"I want to give it to him\". \nTotally cool, I completely understand that. We invite her over to our house for Christmas eve, she won't come. She decided (because FIL went out of town) to come over just the other day. My husband asks where the wooden gym was and she says \"I want your father to be there and give it to him too\". \nNeither my husband or MIL want to tell this man he's in the wrong. I honestly don't see anything changing in the near future, so I ordered the climbing set myself. It comes in next week. \nAITAH?", "created_utc": 1704216362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wusus/aitah_for_buying_a_gift_for_my_son_that_i_had/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is prioritizing a \"nice\" family image over the safety of the small child who was physically threatened by the grandfather.  \n\nPlease protect your baby girl from these people.  There is no way the mother hasn't internalized some of her husband's deplorable sexism, by the way, if as a survival mechanism if nothing else and will manifest it around your daughter.", "NTA. You asked for a gift, it was not given, so you purchased it yourself. If your FIL wasn\u2019t sexiest and/or MIL would grow a spine and stand up to him then it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. They\u2019ve made their bed, they can lie in it.", "NTA \n\nMy bet is that MIL is herself not \"allowed\" to give the gift without FIL by the FIL.\n\nGo get your son the gift, they can keep that one at their home as a reminder that they aren't allowed to treat your kids like crap.\n\nYour SO has been treated like he can't stand up for himself or his family, hopefully this is a step towards seeing that people CAN stand up to FIL. Good on you for having the spine your family needs. Stay strong, get family therapy if needed to help your SO along. \n\nEnjoy shopping for the climber and enjoying your kiddos.", " NTA - I despise this antiquated view of gender roles. Your FIL is a huge AH for this and he is very clearly in the wrong. He also severely compounded this by verbally attacking you. \n\nYes, your husband and/or MIL should admonish him for his behavior. Given his comments on gender, my guess is your FIL has this patriarchal role where he can\u2019t be wrong since he\u2019s the head of the household and all that BS. \n\nI can however, understand your MIL wanting to give a gift in person, but you are not an AH for getting the gift yourself.", "NTA. She can't keep using this gift as a bribe/ransom to get around your boundary.", "NTA in any way. \n\nYou're a good mother. \n\nlet this be the hill that you will die on and get that apology from FIL.", "NTA, but is there a way you can leave a review of his medical practice or make a complaint with the medical licensing board? The thought of him having patients (esp female) in his care makes my stomach churn.", "NTA. There is a lot of toxicity going on with the in-laws. They\u2019re trying to use a gift to a child as leverage. You did fine by removing that little power-play that they are doing. I would say go low or no contact. And don\u2019t mention anything about the indoor gym for the kid.", "NTA\n\nIs FIL still a practicing doctor? His views are abysmal and id report him somehow but not sure for what. Misogyny?\n\nGo completely no contact with them. You don't need their presents. Move if you can.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds awful what a massive AH.", "NTA.\nI would cut my own father out of our lives if he spoke to me, my spouse, or children that way.", "NTA. But why are you staying with your husband? He is going to allow his father to treat your kid(s) like SH\\*T because of their gender.  And how will that affect your son?", "NTA. How he can be so disgusted at the thought of having a granddaughter is so beyond me. He is a huge asshole and doesn't deserve to be around your children until he can love them unconditionally. I'm glad your husband has your back, but he also needs to step up more forcefully. You should not have to defend yourself to your in-laws.", "NTA Your FIL is not only sexist but sounds unhinged. Your MIL also sounds like she has no problem with him verbally abusing him in front of her grandchild.
