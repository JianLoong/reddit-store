When your wife calms down, you need to tell her clearly that your sleep has been constantly affected with her kicking you. She might need to visit a doctor who specializes in sleep disorders.

If you need to have a separate bed because you can't sleep with her, then get one and ignore her tantrums. If she can't realize that your health comes before whatever excuse she has for insisting on cosleeping then she doesn't care about you as much as you think she does.
