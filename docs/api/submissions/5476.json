He's not likely to change, which means the changes have to come from the two of you, not him.**  That means setting boundaries, and then enforcing them.  **Taking a month break from visits with him, after this, gives you two time to work out what to do about this,** what changes to make and how to enforce them, and what the two of you want regarding him.
