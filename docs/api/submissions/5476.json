I'm curious what in the ever-living hell gave this man the delusional audacity to proclaim that HE is in charge? In a house that isn't his. Regarding children that aren't his. What's the story here? What is this man's damage?

Your FIL just got a matter class in the consequences to his over inflated ego. He overstepped his bounds and found out how much you are willing to tolerate.
