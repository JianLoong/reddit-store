My grandfather had a horrible habit of walking into my home unannounced and uninvited. I started locking my doors and my kids and husband followed suit. He still hasn't gotten the hint, but now we live 2 hrs. away. He does the same thing to my mom. The kicker? He wouldn't DREAM of doing this to my brother.

His \u201cpenis envy theory\u201d was a replacements theory when his peers rejected the actual truth, because they didn\u2019t want to be ousted.

No, OP is exhausted and is being disrespected in his own home, he should not shut up so that wife can have some quiet time.", "Didnt he change the neurotica after becoming a father himself lmao?\n\nAlso just so we are clear, i think Freudians theories to be bullshit and lunatical.

I think you and your wife need to have a serious conversation about boundaries, and then about what boundaries to set with him.  If he truly has the impression that \"he's in charge\" you need to nip this in the bud right away.  This is YOUR home- yours and your wife's. He doesn't have dominion over YOUR home.  He should only be allowed at your home when you are ready and willing to have him there. Not just when and how long he sees fit. And he certainly doesn't get to dictate things there either. He also doesn't get to usurp your time with your baby. My guess based on the described behavior is that he cherishes the male child over the female one. His generation tends to believe things this way.  If he's allowed to continue, I think you will begin to see more of this over time too.
