In YOUR house. BAYBEEEEEE I would have absolutely blown tf up. No one is going to talk to me like that in my house, or anywhere, ever, and see my children ever again. I understand your wife is so freshly postpartum (way too fresh for family members to be encroaching like that, no less) but you need to tell her in no uncertain terms your FIL is not allowed back in your house, ever.\n\nAlso, he does not want to spend time with his grandkids and make sure they're happy. If that were the case he would respect that this is not the time for him to be visiting constantly, and he would be helpful when he did. Yelling in front of them is absolutely unacceptable. Speaking to their parents like that is unacceptable. He needs to go.\n\nNTA but you need to lay down the law here.", "NTA    \"he's in charge\" how utterly f'd up is that?\n\nYour wife needs to step up, and shut him down.", "r/Justnofil.   r/raisedbynarcissists.   \n\nYour wife has normalized your FIL's behavior and is very likely afraid of what he will do, if confrontation happens.  She's also recuperating from birth, and needs to be protected.  \n\n **If you two don't change your home rules to protect yourselves and your son/children, FIL will keep on acting like he's in charge, and when your wife is home alone, will intimidate her into compliance.**  \n\nWife needs therapy to help her learn how to stop complying with FIL's emotional abuse and manipulations.  That's a long journey.  The first step is to learn that she doesn't have to comply with his demands, that this is your family, her family, and not FIL's family, and so the decisions made for your house aren't FIL's to make, but the two of you.  Sometimes, **it's hard to take that first step of giving yourself permission to stop complying when the history with the manipulator is one of emotional abuse.**\n\n**FIL is trying to use this vulnerable time to get wife into a habit of compliance with his wants.  This is abusive behavior.**  Because of this behavior, it's reasonable to take a break from seeing FIL for a while.  What he said was important.  FIL believes he's in control.  He believes he should be. \n\nNTA, because **your FIL had just told you he was in charge in your house.  That's crossing all kinds of lines, and he needed to be kicked out.  It's reasonable to tell him he's not allowed to visit at all for a month, just for what he said to you.**  Even if he apologizes, limiting his visits for a while is a reasonable thing, because you two need a break from his invasive behaviors.  He's not helpful, he's just invading.\n\n**His behavior is unacceptable.  He's not likely to change, which means the changes have to come from the two of you, not him.**  That means setting boundaries, and then enforcing them.  **Taking a month break from visits with him, after this, gives you two time to work out what to do about this,** what changes to make and how to enforce them, and what the two of you want regarding him.  A visit once a month?  Once every two or three months?  Only after wife gets therapy?  Only after FIL apologizes for saying he's in charge?", "NTA but the kiss was definitely douchey.", "Your fIL needs some heavy boundary setting and if your wife thinks his behaviour is acceptable she has a problem.

He can show himself out the door", "NTA, you handled the situation perfectly, this guy is stepping all over you and trying to force himself on as an authority in your house. It is you and your wife's house.\n\nNow it's time to have a confrontation with your wife about her father's intrusiveness, and about her actively trying to push you into being his subordinate as well. It doesn't matter how her nuclear family ran when she was a child, that's not how your house is running and if she won't handle her father you will. Because your father-in-law is an asshole for sure, but the real asshole is the person who opened the door for him to enter the house.", "NTA\n\nHe is \"in charge\" of what in your own home, if he can't wash some dishes?\n\nNTA, but you might have to have a talk with your wife about boundaries with your FIL", "NTA.

I think she deserves some leeway. But OP, you were great. NTA.", "Bolliocks. I am fed up with people telling the person who is taking crap to take the high road. All it does is teach the bullies to bully you more. Once you behave like the OP did they realise they can't control you. 'He's in charge'. Well, he certainly learned he isn't! No amount of high road would have led to an improvement in behaviour. It's a weakness people like the FIL prey on.", "If my FIL behaved like this man, his welcome at my house would be revoked.", "The kiss was perfect. It's the only language chavs understand.", "How does he expect to have a relationship with OP when he tries to power trip and say he's in charge? You just gotta cut people like that out.

Remember, we only have OPs side here, so it is likely at least a little bias."]}
