I had only 1 slice as I wanted to save the rest for later. Hours had passed and I went to have some cake but couldn\u2019t find it. I asked Melissa and she said she had eaten the rest because \u2018she wanted something sweet.\u2019 I asked why she would think eating the rest of the cake was a good idea since we were supposed to be sharing it. She shrugged. I was a little annoyed , but i let it slide because I had bought it for the both of us.\n\nFast forward to now, me and some of my friends had went out for food at a somewhat fancy and pricey restaurant. The food was very good so I had brought home some leftovers. I was looking forward to eating them in the morning but when I had opened the fridge, ALL the leftovers were gone. I again, asked Melissa and she confessed she ate them all, claiming that she thought I wouldn\u2019t mind. I was heated. We had a big argument and I called her an selfish  piece of shit and told her that this was probably one of the reasons her wife left her. I guess that hit her a little too hard because after i said that she stopped talking to me for a while. I told the story to a few of my friends and they said I was kind of an AH and should apologize to her. I know I went a little too far but in my defense I paid a good amount of money for the food and I feel like if she asked before touching my leftovers we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702174582, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18et7zu/aita_for_bringing_up_my_friends_divorce/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The first time could be a mistake, but not if you repeat it.\nShe's probably depressed and maybe eating is what helps her.\n\nYou need to talk to her. Apologize for they way you talked to her but be firm with your boundaries. She cant keep stealing (and it is stealing if you did agree to let her eat it) your food. Either she has her own food, go to teraphy or she can start looking for another place to live. And I would ask for her to have a date to leave in mind. Who knows if she'll become a \"parasyte\" in the future \n\nIt's good to help people, but whitin limits", "NTA.\n\nI will say you did go a bit too far but her behavior is unacceptable.  \n\nIt's time to have the \"time for you to look for your own place.  I'd like you to move out by X date.\"  No justification.  No arguments.  No negotiation.", "ESH\nHer for eating your leftovers and cake without asking, you for your rude comment about her divorce. That was out of line and intended to hurt her, and doesn't address the problem.", "NTA\n\nshe deserved that. The next step is to give her a week to get out. She is not a friend she is a leach", "OP set your deadline for her moving out, i.e., like in 30 days as a strong date, and make sure it's in writing for documentation purposes.  If she got laid off then she should be receiving unemployment and then have some type of income.  The past has no point in revisiting because she crossed boundaries, which could have been a factor in her previous relationship she never learned to address.  The best thing to do is to say \"in order to keep our friendship we need to no longer live together\" because you can't keep supporting her, allowing her to cross lines, etc. and she's never going to stop.  DO NOT allow her to manipulate you into extending it past your deadline - otherwise she'll never leave.", "\"Melissa, I know you're going through something. But, sucking down all my food isn't working for me. I get hungry too. And I need you to be considerate. Stop the button pushing. Its annoying AH. You need to ask me before you consume my leftovers or just go out and get food.\"\n\nNTA.", "ESH-She\u2019s an appalling house guest who could need help and you\u2019re an asshole for bringing up her divorce.", "ESH. She's definitely overstepping her privileges with the cake and the leftovers. But when you said you \"let it slide\", does it mean you didn't communicate the problem with her? It's important to let her know too, so she can improve if she doesn't know already.\n\nOn the other hand, the things you said in response to the leftovers were kinda out-of-pocket. You shouldn't have brought in the divorce, especially if it was recent. Apologise for sure, then communicate the problem to her, and if she isn't cooperating then you should look into separating living spaces.", "Melissa selfishly eats up food that she should leave for you.  This isn't very nice and if it's a dealbreaker, you could in good conscience ask her to find another place to live.\n\nBut instead you called her a selfish piece of s@#$ and told her that's why her wife left her?!?!?  My dear, you have some serious anger management problems there.  You didn't go \"a little to far,\" you responded in a completely disproportionate and out of control way, hurting her as much as you possibly over because...um...expensive leftovers....?\n\nESH, but really, mostly you for your problematic rage and the fact that you minimize it and excuse it.", "OP, I have a question that I think a lot of people want an answer to.  Does Melissa contribute towards the bills?\n\nIf no, then you\u2019re absolved.  If yes, you\u2019re the asshole.\n\nINFO", "Yeah, YTA. You attacked her character instead of explaining what boundaries you expected. Being angry is OK, but stay on topic. You likely have no idea what happened between her and her wife.", "No need to get angry. Next time just leave food for Mellisa mixed with a lot of laxatives. She won\u2019t touch your food ever.", "1/2 ah 1/2 Nta. Your stuff she could have asked. You could have been nicer.", "YTA. What she did was not ok, but you needed to tell her that. You needed to request she replace it. Or move out. Or at least abide by some lodging rules.\n\nIt sucks to spend a lot of money on something and look forward to it only to have someone take it. It sucks worse to have someone you trust dig at your deepest insecurities by repeating some variation of the hurtful words your spouse has thrown at you, and likely during the worst and lowest period in your life. Coming from someone who has experienced both of those things--eventually items can be repurchased or forgotten, but those words will hang around forever. \nI got really upset about the fancy-ass food that was eaten out if my fridge. And then I got over it. I immediately dropped the friend who decided tonkick me when inwas down. Maybe that is what you were aiming for. If not, hope it was worth the cost of your dinner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
