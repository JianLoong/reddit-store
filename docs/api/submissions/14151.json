He stayed in my life and swore to me I was still as much his son and he would always be there for me. I loved him and thought the world of him so I was really glad to hear that. I had no other father figure really. Well, except for my grandfather, his father. My mom became really unstable after my sister died and I ended up being raised by my father.\n\nWhen I was 15 he met his wife Nat and she had a 3 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. Nat didn't like me. She knew I wasn't his kid by blood and she disliked how much my grandparents adored me.

One time it resulted in my grandparents kicking her out of the house.\n3. My father was taking me out to celebrate my 17th birthday and she complained that he was going to leave her kids behind. She said he should not be treating them as less than. Told him that they were watching us leave them out and would feel like he didn't love them. She also said she would not be okay with him treating me like the only kid in the house because I was so much bigger and almost grown.\n4. She tried to find out info on my biological father.\n\nI became estranged from my father because of all this. He stayed married to her despite all that she did. He even let her say crap to my grandparents about buying me gifts and how that should be spent on younger kids, not an almost adult. My grandparents fought back that I was their grandson. My father sided with Nat.\n\nWe remained estranged until his death last year. That's when my grandparents went through the legal process to evict my Nat and her kids. They own the house and owned a lot of stuff my father used. They never charged him rent or anything but wanted me to get everything. Nat was shocked that they would do that and she expected they would let her get the house and other stuff they had given dad.

She said I was nothing and got everything and how I should be sharing or leaving it to her kids who lost the only father they ever had. I just kept laughing and walked away from her (she showed up where I work).
