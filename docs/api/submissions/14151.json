You can't treat someone tat way and expect anything.", "Nta you should\u2019ve said that her kids weren\u2019t his his because they aren\u2019t biological related by her logic- what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander", "So you\u2019re estranged from your step dad but still are in contact with your step mom (who always hated you) after his death and your step grandparents are giving you their entire inheritance instead of to their other step grandkids. And then some friend of your estranged step dad said to you that you shouldn\u2019t have laughed when your step mom insulted you.\n\nIs that the gist of this story?", "NTA.", "Nta. Randomly text her and tell her that her kids aren\u2019t his bio kids. For fun.", "Nta", "NTA.  Nat will have to get happy in the same pants she got mad in.", "Nta its funny how the kids who are not bio related should get the estate but because you are not bio related you should not get anything. I would have laughed too at how toxic and frankly stupid and unevolved nat is. She really doesn\u2019t get it.", "NTA she's a leech & she's not even good at it! Wtf", "NTA and your dad's friend was gaslighting you. She came to your work to harass you, I'd have laughed in her face too.\n\nShe never learned you catch bees with honey, flies with vinegar. This is her consequence.", "He\u2019s right.  Empathy and compassion go a long way.  Those kids did lose their dad.  You\u2019re NTA but could have handled things a little better.", "She doesn\u2019t want the house for the kids, she wants it for her. Why does she think that you, a non bio, is less than her children who were also non bio? Purely selfish. I\u2019m glad someone like that got nothing. If she hadn\u2019t been an A, the grandparents probably would\u2019ve let her stay in the house. NTA", "NTA-Yes you laughed..........Allllllllll the way to the bank.", "NTA fuck her! How is she gonna criticize you for not being your dads bio son when her kids aren\u2019t his either? That is the most hypocritical ass shit I\u2019ve ever heard. I would\u2019ve laughed in her face harder. Her kids are innocent yes but they\u2019re not your problem. I\u2019m sorry and honestly pissed to hear that your father sided with Nat in the end considering how great he was in the beginning, I hate parents like that.", "NTA.  You weren\u2019t laughing at the kids, who had no real fault in this.  You were laughing at the woman who made her own bed and is now sleeping in it.  FAFO", "Really sorry for your loss. Definitely NTA. If it was the other way around she wouldn\u2019t be saying you should get a share of what her kids were left, even though none of you guys are bio. Laughing and walking away after being harassed at work is the most kind thing you could\u2019ve done to her in the moment, she definitely deserved worse", "Funny how she cares about him being the only father her kids had compared to him being the only father you ever had. NTA. If you are feeling a pang in your heart for the kids, give them something you feel is appropriate for their relationship with your shared father. Other than that, you take care of yourself and your grandparents. Y'all be strong.", "NTA.  You owe nothing to people who abuse you-- or who allow people to abuse you.  Look into local laws about harassment and see if you can eliminate her \"visits\" to your work, etc.", " NTA: Her kids aren\u2019t any more \u201crelated\u201d to your late father than you are OP. The difference is that Nat wanted to shove you out (and your father let her) in favor of her kids. Grandparents likely saw her toxic ass and know what both your father and Nat are terrible. Those kids aren\u2019t owed anything from your grandparents. They knew you longer  and had an established relationship with you since you were a baby. Tell anyone who thinks you owe Nat or her kids anything to go kick rocks. Nat is getting the karma she deserves and while her children are innocent, they aren\u2019t OP\u2019s problem.", "NTA Your father was the one in a relationship with Nat and her kids.  It was his responsibility to provide for them if he wanted to.  It sounds like he was mostly lively off his parents and didn't have a lot of assets but he could have talked to his parents or saved to leave them something.  He chose not to and you have every right to respect that choice and the choice your grandparents made to give things to you.  Nat can demand all she wants.  If she wanted you to treat her more generously she should have treated you better as a child.", "NTA. I woulda acted the same way.", "Nope, she deserved what she got. She should have realized that her kids were in the same position you were. Duh! The fact that she didn't see that is what kept her from getting anything for her kids. She sounds like a total a-hole.", "[removed]", "NTA you reap what you sow, you should tell her that!

Loss is Loss. That said, finances are finances. Nat is likely entitled to any assets her husband had. She is not entitled to assets he did not own. She made a point to drive a wedge between the OP and his guardian/ stepfather of 15 years as well as her husband and his parents. It is not the OP's decision but the owners of the property.  She made a financial decision when she disregarded the OP's grandparents' feelings, and her anger will not change that.\nWas laughing mature, not especially, but to show up at the OP's place of business  is also not mature, and OP kept it together.  NTA", "NTA,  those kids were not your dads kids.  You treated her just like she treated you.  Tell your dad's friend to mind his own business as he has only heard a one-sided story .", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t react like this in front of her kids. Unlike her, you aren\u2019t trying to make her kids feel bad. Her kids won\u2019t even be aware of your reaction unless she intentionally hurts them by telling them. Given how horribly she treated you & ruined your relationship with your father, she shouldn\u2019t expect anything. You do not owe her or her children anything.", "NTA they were no more his kids than you are and clearly LESS your grandparents\u2019 grandkids. I\u2019d have laughed at her too because it would have been that or profanity. Plus she showed up at your WORK to pick at that bone. Classless and not worthy of respect.", "NTA - Sounds like you have some great and loving grandparents, take that example and carry it forward, take care of them as they age and don\u2019t hesitate to let them know what they mean to you. I don\u2019t know what type of relationship you have with your fathers wife\u2019s children but try to remember your dad loved them too, that doesn\u2019t mean they are entitled to anything just that if they are decent people show them kindness when you can down the road.", "NTA at all. I love that you just laughed at her after she had the AUDACITY to show up at your place of work of all places and complain to you. Her kids are nothing to your Dad then if you\u2019re nothing to him. Why do her kids get more of a right because they\u2019re younger when they aren\u2019t biologically related? I\u2019m so sorry your Dad was poisoned by her and never tried to fix the relationship, that was shitty of him. You don\u2019t need to feel bad for her kids, don\u2019t let your Dads friend feed you that guilt trip. Just trust your Grandparents, they love you. That\u2019s all that matters. You were always family, I\u2019m sorry your Dad and Nat disagreed with that. I hope Nat gets the future she deserves.", "NTA", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss OP, NTA\n\nWould you consider giving the something of your dads as a memento for them bc he was techno their dad to? I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been A holes to you to but if they haven\u2019t would you consider it ?", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. \n\nAlso I now dub her name is now Gnat.", "And also bear in mind that Nat has likely poisoned her kids\u2019 opinion of OP, and that they might not learn the truth about what happened until they\u2019re older. And that\u2019s not their fault either.\n\nOP, you\u2019re very much NTA, and you\u2019re not under any moral obligation to help Nat or her kids. I would go so far as to discourage you from giving _anything_ to Nat, but _if_ you felt so inclined, you could set up a trust for the kids. No judgment either way. I\u2019d probably keep the ties cut and give them nothing. Your grandparents made that same choice.", "I was going to mention this as well.  OP has known the father for longer but was not considered his parent by his new wife but new wife\u2019s kids are his kids and deserve something instead of OP?\n\nNTA", "And tries to get info on OP\u2019s bio-Dad, presumably as a \u201cthis is the man who should be raising you now get out of our lives\u201d comment, but meanwhile, where is the bio-Dad for *her* kids?", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t see anything in the post suggesting that the grandparents gave anything to OP, but the _title_ of the post says they gave _everything_ to OP. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Why the hell should OP give money to kids he barely knows ? The kids of the evil step mother at that. He hasn\u2019t been in touch with them for years and the dad also never adopted them. They still have a living mother. And probably the guy who was the sperm doner is still around somewhere", "Idk you don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny that she called OP \u201cnothing\u201d and in the same breath demanded he share his inheritance?

People who leave a trail of damage and emotional abuse wherever they go. When we meet someone like that who manipulates us into thinking its our own fault & that we are lesser. If we could learn about such people in school, that would be a valuable lesson indeed. These people absolutely destroy lives. And they are often in positions of power.", "The dictionary definition of boasting literally requires talking speaking. But for real you don\u2019t think dumb people are funny? Or you don\u2019t think Nat is dumb? I really love the layers of dumb in this story. To fight with and piss off the people who own your house is dumb, to then expect them to give you the house is another layer of dumb, and then to insult OP and expect help. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever encountered anyone so dumb in real life. The least she can do is be good for a laugh lol", "Honestly I only see petty people here. TO kick out your sons children (they were as much his children as OP was) out of spite? To rejoice when your half-siblings (again, same \"father\") have no more home because your grandparents are petty? And the fucking father... don't get me started on him. Bunch of petty AH each one worse than another."]}
