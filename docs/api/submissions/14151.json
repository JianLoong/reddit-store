Idk how old they are but it\u2019s a little sad they weren\u2019t liked the same because their mother (same with my mom who does suck).  my grandmas other son died and his child\u2019s mother got with the guy who her other son dated and this guy and my living uncle bled her dry. Ex her house burned down and his friends were the contractor, it\u2019s not insulated properly and I will now have to pay extra for that.

Partly they did not meet till my brothers were older around 10 and 12 and he was younger about 6 if I remember right. As a little boy he either cling or broke stuff and it aggravated then which I get. But also they had to share their dad.

She came to YOUR workplace specifically to harrass you. Laughing was by far the much nicer behavior.  I refuse to judge you for laughing. Her behavior since you were 15 was abusive. That bs should have been shut down immediately.  I still can't believe your dad just rolled like that. \n\nI can't even imagine how much that hurt. I know my mom never defended me when her bf would tease me or make fun of me, so I felt very angry for you reading that crap Gnat did. Oh my goodness! \n\nI am very disappointed your dad fell for her hatefulness. I wonder if she was feeding your dad lies, telling him how you were mean to her and/or her kids? It just occurred to me that if he believed something like that, it makes a little but of sense. Altho I would have sat you down and we would have hammered it out, but that's me.  I have always said you cannot pick your parents.  It is up to us to pick good partners, but that does not always go well! \n\nAnyway, she came to your place of work. I recommend straight up calling the cops if she shows up again. Explain she is harrassing you about your grandparent's property that they gave you. I don't imagine the Gnat's kids have much of a relationship with you, seeing how ugly & hate-filled their mother is. But like others have said, you can't pick your parents (at least biologically!
