He and my mom were together from the time I was 6 months old until I was 7. They had my little sister together and divorced after she died. He stayed in my life and swore to me I was still as much his son and he would always be there for me. I loved him and thought the world of him so I was really glad to hear that. I had no other father figure really. Well, except for my grandfather, his father. My mom became really unstable after my sister died and I ended up being raised by my father.\n\nWhen I was 15 he met his wife Nat and she had a 3 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. Nat didn't like me. She knew I wasn't his kid by blood and she disliked how much my grandparents adored me. She'd always bring up my not being his real kid, she undermined our relationship so many times.\n\nExamples\n\n1. She referred to my dad as a childless parent because my sister died and would say how tragic it would be to lose your only child\n2. When my grandmother would say how like my dad I was, Nat would interject with how impossible that was because I was not his bio child. One time it resulted in my grandparents kicking her out of the house.\n3. My father was taking me out to celebrate my 17th birthday and she complained that he was going to leave her kids behind. She said he should not be treating them as less than. Told him that they were watching us leave them out and would feel like he didn't love them. She also said she would not be okay with him treating me like the only kid in the house because I was so much bigger and almost grown.\n4. She tried to find out info on my biological father.\n\nI became estranged from my father because of all this. He stayed married to her despite all that she did. He even let her say crap to my grandparents about buying me gifts and how that should be spent on younger kids, not an almost adult. My grandparents fought back that I was their grandson. My father sided with Nat.\n\nWe remained estranged until his death last year. That's when my grandparents went through the legal process to evict my Nat and her kids. They own the house and owned a lot of stuff my father used. They never charged him rent or anything but wanted me to get everything. Nat was shocked that they would do that and she expected they would let her get the house and other stuff they had given dad. She asked about her kids and they said they had not seen those kids in years so would not be giving them anything.\n\nNat confronted me over it and I laughed at her anger at me over it. She said I was nothing and got everything and how I should be sharing or leaving it to her kids who lost the only father they ever had. I just kept laughing and walked away from her (she showed up where I work). She told me I was an asshole and a friend of my father's heard about it and told me I should have just walked away and not laughed. He said at the end of the day her kids were dad's kids too and to think about them and how much this must suck for them at least.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680802336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12drj0x/aita_for_laughing_at_my_estranged_late_fathers/", "score": 233, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't have any control over what your grandparents decide to do anyway.

She ostracized you and your grandparents reacted badly to it. Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind.", "Sorry for your loss. NTA\n\nThe only thing I'll add is that her kids are not responsible for her behavior, and they did lose a father figure. However, it's ironic that no one sees the similarity between you and Nat's two kids. Be as angry as you want at her, but don't direct it at her kids unless they earn it.", "NTA. It's your grandparents' estate, and they can decide who gets what or anything for that matter", "How could you not laugh at her inability to see the irony? NTA, your grandparents are awesome, Nat and your father are the A.H. Nat's kids are victims like you are, but I'm sure their mother will ingratiate the three of them into another household soon.", "NTA - next time laugh while calling the cops on her for showing up to your work to harass you.", "Nta, she deserves it", "Should you not have laughed to not upset the other kids that lost their dad? I can agree with that - but the key here is that YOU WEREN'T LAUGHING AT THEM. You were laughing at *her.* She got what she deserved and screwed those other kids out of anything by keeping them away due to being a b\\* about things.\n\nI'm going with NTA on this.", "NTA - Was it a bit petty to laugh? Maybe... But it was certainly well deserved and you are definitely not an AH for it. Also, I can only imagine how cathartic it felt!\n\nGood on your grandparents for doing the right thing! I love that Nat f'ed around and doesn't like what she found out... xD", "NTA. Sounds like a modern version of a fairytale to me.", "Ah well. In a perfect world you wouldn't have laughed but you had a lot of pent up anger. NTA.", "NTA Nat is. It serves her right that she got kicked to the curb with absolutely nothing. And you laughing in her face? Keep laughing. She deserves the back the cruel medicine she's been dishing out at you. BTW Sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nWait wait wait... So she called your dad childless, and then says he's the only father her kids ever known?...lol", "NTA - Kudos to your grandparents for seeing who she really is.  Do not feel bad for her, she reaped what she sowed.", "Not unusual to laugh when presented with unexpected comical statements in a socially awkward situation. Nat ambushed you at work, probably the nicest thing you could do was laugh at her ludicrous ideas while walking away from her. You'd have been T A if you engaged further with her.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nPpl are always so shocked when karma bites them in the as$ for their own actions.", "NTA. Maybe laughing at her wasn't the best move, but she definitely earned your scorn. \n\nAs others have said, remember that she brought all this on, and the kids are innocent victims. Obviously, if you want to do anything for them, it should be on your terms and under your control.", "NTA, After the way she treated you. She got what she deserved.", "NTA. She ruined any kindness you may have had, or affection to the kids had she embraced you rather than ruin your relationship with your dad. She likely did pay your dad any rent so the free ride is over.", "Obviously not the arsehole, she earned it, but I think you are making a mistake by engaging with her at all. \n\nAs understandable as it is - because she sounds like the worst kind of bitch - it is not healthy to take pleasure in the misery of others, no matter how terrible they are. That's not me judging you, because I get why you laughed at her, but it sounds like you could do with talking to someone about this stuff because you don't want to carry this anger and resentment around with you. Not for her benefit. For yours.\n\nIn the mean time, cut her out of your life completely. There is no reason for you to have anything to do with her anymore.", "NTA\n\nNat sounds like a real piece of\u2026 work. \n\nI\u2019m a bit surprised that you legally inherited anything. Generally the deceased\u2019s property goes to their spouse. Your dad must have either never updated his will or everything was originally owned by your grandparents or he was never legally married to Nat and never legally adopted her kids. \n\nI partially agreed with the old friend, Nat\u2019s kids are the real losers here but I would never trust Nat to give anything of real value to get kids either. If you have the means to put things in something like a trust and gift it to them when they go to college or whatever you may want to consider that.", "NTA. Your grandparents did what they wanted. As for Nat's kids they hadn't seen your grandparents in years. If the kids cared, they should have stayed in touch.", "ESH.  I get why you laughed.", "ESH!\n\n1. You mother for basically abondoning you. The loss of a child is unimaginable. But, she had another child who still needed his mother.\n2. Nat for all the horrible things she did to you.\n3. Your father, for not defending you against his new wife and becoming estranged from you.\n4. Your grandparents, for choosing one grandchild over the other 2.\n5. You, for laughing at someone who just lost her husband and ignoring your two siblings.\n\nThe only ones who are NTA are your 2 siblings. They did nothing to deserve any of this. They were simply born and have now lost their father.", "ESH. Nat sucks. You shouldn't have laughed at her. Seems weird to be gleeful about this one-upmanship when your siblings are homeless and the man you claim you saw as your father is dead. Your grandparents suck because they know their son would be devastated at this. Only people that don't suck are those poor kids.
