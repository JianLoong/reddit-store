I'm so excited because he is the love of my life, but I'm scared my mom might ruin it for me. My mom has been here for me through the good times and bad and has made me a better person in so many ways, so I decided that she would be my MOH. But now I'm considering kicking her out of my wedding altogether.\n\nMy mom has been very supportive of my wedding, but as it's been getting closer and closer she seems to be jealous and all over my husband. Whenever I try to talk about it with her it ruins her whole mood. And whenever she comes over she always sits right next to my fiance and flirts with him. We've thought of it as weird, but we brush it off as maybe she's not flirting but just trying to be nice because he's about to be her SIL. Yesterday she came to visit. While she was there I went into the kitchen to get some snacks and when I came back he looked very uncomfortable (Which is usual when she came over, but he said that he would be fine dealing with her for now as she's supposed to be helping me out with the wedding) but this time he seemed extra uncomfortable. He completely distanced himself from my mother. When she left I immediately asked what was wrong and he said that she was acting extra flirty and that when I was in the kitchen, she said that she would be a much better woman for him than me because she's a \"real woman\" (She's gotten lip filler, a BBL, and countless other surgeries, so I'm not too sure about that \"Real\" woman thing.) But anyway, the thing is that this isn't just her trying to be nice and accidentally saying something she didn't really mean or whatever like that, because she's done this before. My mom divorced my dad about 10 or so months ago and after that, she did the same thing to my cousin. She was hitting on him, and they actually wound up dating for a couple of months. (I know it's weird, but we live in a place where it's legal) Once I found out that she did this, I got very angry. I called her and told her that she would be uninvited from the wedding. After that, family members and some of her friends started contacting me and calling me an AH and many other names because she didn't mean it and is just \"mourning her divorce\" which in my opinion is the worst excuse because she was the one who divorced my father in the first place. I honestly don't know what to think anymore. I'm starting to think I may have been overreacting.

Your mother needs validation that she is still desirable after her divorce, and she is going about it in the most inappropriate way possible.  If you absolutely must go through with the big event, elope a couple days before your ceremony is scheduled, then you can show up and tell everyone you're just there for the pictures and party.  afterwards, cut her off, cut her out, drop the other family members that are calling you the AH because they have no idea what is actually going on.

I mean she's literally tried to steal your fiance. No question about it. \n\nHowever I would like to ask, how old is your mum? And is this behaviour quite a change to the normal for her? Because some medical conditions can lower someone's inhibitions and also make them overly sexual. I'm not saying this is the reason or excuse for your mums behaviour, but I just wanted to put it out there just incase there's other behaviour changes you've noticed, or memory problems etc. Even dietary changes. \n\nHowever, at face value, I would tell your mum she's 1) no longer invited to the wedding at all. \n2) go Low contact or No contact with her. \n\nThat is disgusting behaviour of a mother to do to her daughter. Literally flirting with him infront of you. And now she's literally asked him to be with her instead of you. She's a disgusting excuse for a mother to do that to her own daughter, and clearly doesn't care about devastate you, hurting your feelings, ruining your relationship, or how you feel, and has no respect for you at all. So if I were you I'd treat her exactly the same. Cut her off and don't give a shit about how she feels being cut off from you and not being allowed at your wedding. She didn't care about hurting you or ruining your relationship, so don't care how it affects her cutting her off. \nIf your fiance had been the shitty type of person to have liked her attention, she would have gone even further, either sleeping with him secretly, or just outright stealing him and having a relationship ship with him with no concern of how it would affect you. \n\nThe fact she dated her nephew is disgusting and almost predatory like depending on their age and is also disgusting. \n\nYou don't need someone like her in your life. \n\nIf there is a chance you think it could be medical, get her seen by a medical professional asap.", "You don't need this Jerry Springer shit in your life.

It\u2019s not less bad because he\u2019s a dude, and its definitely more bad because what kind of moptart has so little love or respect for their child that they would not only make a play for their partner but do so while potentially traumatizing said partner. I could rant for days about the kind of stress or triggers that can result from even a mild encounter and this is someone theoretically on the scene for the rest of their lives.

But if that\u2019s the case, a different relative needs to take the lead on that. \n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior or the fact that she sexually harassed your fianc\u00e9, so I would still ban her from the wedding, if it were me.", "Geez, in retrospect duh!
