This started before I can even remember. There are photos of us there, just the two of us. Mom didn't come when she was alive and we kept it up after she died.\n\nLast year dad married Sarah. Sarah has a son Jake (8). I'm 15.\n\nSo dad and I had planned our trip for this year and then Jake asked if he could come. Dad told Jake this was just for me and him, and that we could do something else another time. Sarah said it wouldn't kill us to let Jake join and since it was father/son time, he should be there since dad is the other father figure Jake has. So dad said he could come and asked me to be okay with it. I told him I wasn't and that there are other things he coin join in for but this was always our thing. Sarah said I could let my \"little brother\" join.\n\nI waited a few days and the plans were still Jake comes. So I told my dad I wasn't going anymore and that I didn't want Jake to intrude on that but since I had no say, I was taking myself out of the equation. Sarah heard me say this and said I couldn't pull out because Jake wanted time with me as badly as he wanted time with dad. I told her I didn't want the cabin trip to include Jake and it was never meant to include anyone else. She asked dad if he was seriously going to let me just decide to pull out almost last minute. He said it wasn't going to be any good if he had to force me to go.\n\nThe very next day dad decided to drop the cabin trip. Jake was upset and Sarah was furious at me and she said this was all my fault and I was such a spoiled little brat. She said Jake wanted to join us and be included and seen as a part of the family, one of the boys, and I shit all over him. I told her Jake goes bowling with my dad once a month, that dad helps him document bugs. He has his own things with dad and he joins us for other stuff. That I should be allowed one tradition that has been there for years and has always just been for me and dad. Sarah said I was still spiteful and hurt an 8 year old.\n\nI should also add that dad has told me we'll do the trip just us around Halloween because he knows I was right and it should be kept for just us.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693551526, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166zuc1/aita_for_pulling_out_of_mine_and_my_dads/", "score": 4267, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was always your thing with your dad, just you and him. Is it a \"boys\" trip? Technically, but i would say this is more a \"OP and dad trip\". \n\nKids are entitled to alone time with their parent in blended families, the step siblings don't have to be invited to everything and your stepmother should not be mad that you're asking for that. Specially considering your dad offered to do something else later so the three of you could go together. Keep the tradition with you + making new ones with the three of you, sounds perfectly fine.", "Sarah sounds like a razor-tongued adolescent, not a mother. Are you sure she's old enough to have an 8yo, or is Jake in fact her little brother?\n\nOP, was your dad in earshot when she called you \\*checks notes\\* a spoiled little brat, spiteful, and someone who s#its all over an 8yo? If not, have you told him about her comments? Because they were *way over the line* for someone who literally married a widower with a teenager, one year ago. \n\nAnyway, NTA. Enjoy the October trip. In future, make it your policy not to talk about treats or parties around people who aren't going to be invited to participate in them. \n\nAnd do what you can to be nice to Jake because he's a helpless pawn in all this... and he has a real piece of work for a mother. He's gonna need you for a big brother in the future, for real.", "Of course NTA\n\nIt is completely ok to have some alonetime with your dad. Even more so, if it's already an established tradition.\n\nJake has already his own stuff with your dad. With that in mind, it's even more ok, that you have your thing with your dad.", "NTA... I'm going to answer as a divorced mom. Let's say I marry someone else who has a child. There's still going to be stuff I do with my son that's just us! Traditions like you said. And there will be stuff I do with stepchild to bond... And stuff all together to feel like a big happy family! An 8 year old isn't old enough to understand. He just hears \"cabin, that's fun I want to go!\" And you're the cool 15 year old he wants to be around. \n\nIt's the mom's responsibility to tell the 8 year old \"No... That's a thing they do alone\". Mom could take Jake somewhere fun. It could be a thing where you go with your dad to the cabin and Jake and his mom go off to make their own tradition on the same days. Then on a different occasion (and a different cabin if needed) have a boys weekend all three of you so he gets to experience a boys cabin! But that's totally insensitive of Sarah to not see your side of it. Honestly how dare she call you a spoiled brat? \n\nIf I were in your shoes it would feel like the vibe of the trip had totally been ruined from having a new kid tag along. You have memories for years of the trip being a certain way. It would be changed irreparably if you changed the dynamic. I don't know if everyone would agree.. but I get it.. and good for you for standing up for yourself. I hope your dad tells Sarah she was out of line for what she said to you.", "Absolutely NTA\nI really hope for your sake your dad steps in with Sarah because if my husband spoke to my son (his stepson) that way, I\u2019d lose my mind. As someone who lost a parent at a very young age, I\u2019d be very hurt and would\u2019ve just pulled out of the whole thing as well. \n\nI hope you have a great trip in October and your dad deals with his gross selfish wife.", "Definitely NTA.

Your dad is completely to blame for telling Jake he could come on the trip before clearing it with you first. It is not your fault at all that your dad messed up like this and Jake's upset is mostly down to him.\n\nThis is, and always has been, a trip for just you and your dad. It is not a snub or a deliberate move to exclude Jake from the family; it is a tradition that you want to continue to nurture with your father and you're not being a \"spoiled little brat\" or \"spiteful\" for not wanting it to change. \n\nI hope your dad is fighting your corner with Sarah, not only because he needs to own up to his mistake, but also her reaction to this really sounds to me like she has it in for you.", "NTA  \nIt looks like you include Jake in other things, but you want to keep this one as only thing you two do. Sarah is AH for wanting to take this from you - even if she just want to make sure Jake is \"one of the boys\" as she is blind for things where HE IS \"one of the boys\". \n\nSarah need to step up her step-mom game, because now it looks like she is father's wife only looking out for her bio-son.", "NTA, this is the time with your dad. Your mom never even got to go.  If you let your stepbrother go this year she most likely will demand to go herself next year.  She is a f-ing AH as she said that your dad is his other father figure.  Does he do things with his dad?  If so are you invited on to go along?  Next time he does something with his dad demand to go along, see how that plays out.", "NTA. You were right to say what you thought.", "NTA, he knows you were right but what? It will take him till Halloween to find his balls? I hope the trip works out for you but I wouldn't hold your breath since your Dad is clearly spinless\n\nEdited to add that I think you should show your father and Sarah this thread, you have been really calm and mature in your writing and are clearly a good kid,maybe seeing other people's opinions might make them see things differently.  It might not get your trip back but I suspect this won't be the last time Sarah throws her toys out of the pram so might be good for the inevitable next time", "NTA, but Sarah is a massive asshole. Be courteous but distant from her and raise that emotional boundary up like a high wall so she doesn't try to overstep again.", "NTA rather than kick up a stink you made your position clear, allowed time for your dad to make his decision, and then when you weren\u2019t happy with the outcome you politely excused yourself\n\ni don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here apart from Sarah, you don\u2019t foster family integration by forcing people together. that just creates resentment", "It\u2019s really concerning that the new wife felt comfortable calling you names. From what I can tell you remained calm and articulated your feelings logically and with consideration. You demonstrated more maturity than her. You need to have an additional talk with dad, about her not treating you with common decency and respect. And that while she is his wife, it doesn\u2019t give her the right to resort to name calling and treating you like she did. And that her attempting to force you into a deeper relationship with her and her son is going to have the opposite effect. You didn\u2019t magically become his brother, and if she continues to manufacture conflict there will never be a chance for one developing organically.", "NTA it is a Tradition for you and your dad and that's it", "NTA\n\nYour dad should have told Sarah No and explained to Jake why this was not his trip.\n\nSarah sounds like an entitled child, and had spoilt your Dad/Son time. I hope you get the Halloween trip.", "NTA, Jake\u2018s a kid but I\u2019m side eyeing his mother and tbh your dad too, because he knows what\u2019s right but isn\u2019t brave enough (right now?) to honestly say so to his wife.", "NTA \n\n I remember this post where a dad asked if he was the AH for not taking stepdaughter with him to paris, and taking only his daughter cause she asked for time with him. Everyone said he is the asshole and that his stepdaughter it's his kid too. That's to show that this sub hates stepparents.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell him you love him (because it's clear you do) but that he needs to set the boundaries now, or they won't be there in the future.

One with you, your step brother, and your step mom.

I feel the majority of people here are either not much younger than OP or childless. \nEveryone is talking about what is owed and what is given, like parental affection is a zero-sum game.", "Hey when are you going on your honeymoon, we wanna join! So great to see someone extend the invitation! Thanks!!! THE MORE THE MERRIER!", "I never said he can't do anything one-on-one with his Dad, in fact I acknowledged that I can understand wanting that, I'm just saying that this specifically seems like a father-son trip, and if that's the case then step-bro should have a chance to come along and have that experience too, if he wants. I'm sure that if his mother and father had a second son while she was alive that he would have been invited along as well, and I seriously doubt OP would have had a problem with that", "I hope you and your stepbrother have fun hating each other for the rest of your lives!", "Lol.  OP needs to learn he isn\u2019t the most important person.  \n\nMoreover, nowhere does OP state that he\u2019s not invited when his father and 8-year old step brother do something.", "> I'd be seriously re evaluating our marriage. \n\nI kinda wish you hadn\u2019t said that, because it might be exactly the reason OP hasn\u2019t said anything to his dad yet. Even though it\u2019s not his job or place to cover for his stepmom\u2019s inexcusable behavior, I can see him worrying about his dad\u2019s happiness and not wanting to \u201cruin\u201d things for his dad by being truthful.", "Bowling sounds like a father son thing and so does Bug collecting that OPs dad and Jake do together. \n\nOPs dad and his wife do married people things 1 on 1, maybe they should stop and include everyone? No one wins if someone is left out.\n\nThere was comments about a potential sibling, and the reply was they'd do a second trip.", "See, I\u2019m not the kind of person who calls the health department because I think everyone\u2019s service dog is fake, so you might not get this perspective, but my half- siblings and I have a great relationship, as I do with their (but not my) step-siblings, and the full bio ones - though we just say siblings. We love each other and believe service dogs are real. \n\nPart of what makes those relationships so strong is that we all respect and understand that each of us has a different relationship with the various parents and steps and exes. We support each other and try to see things from other people\u2019s vantages. And when we shout \u2018the more the merrier\u2019 and invite people, it\u2019s always on our own behalf - we\u2019re never arrogant or smug enough to believe that it\u2019s our place to invite someone to my sister\u2019s dinner with our dad without asking them both if it\u2019s okay. \n\nAnd we don\u2019t shit on 15 yo children who\u2019ve lost a parent who\u2019s done absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nBut again, I understand how that all could be a foreign concept", "He does if you know how to read", "You should probably also make sure that she knows your own birth mother never even went on this trip", "If that is how this goes, then OP, as a parent, let me say: your dad does not want you to hide things or cover for people that hurt you just to \"save his feelings.\" My husband is my SOULMATE, and if my daughter told me he'd said those things to her, I'd be GLAD she showed me the truth. Cuz if he can say those things, he's not who I think he is anyway, and I shouldn't be with him. OP, tell your dad the truth about what she said. If they split up eventually cuz of how she treated you, then believe me, your dad will be glad you showed him the truth. As a mom I'd be more upset that my kid somehow was raised thinking my feelings matter more than her mental and emotional wellbeing.", "Ah, I did miss a sentence, even on re-read after seeing your post. I shall return my fainting couch and smelling salts. \n\nBut really, I didn\u2019t criticize OP at all. He\u2019s 15, he\u2019s allowed this, and he acted age appropriately to the situation. I criticized the parents. The histrionics are only coming from you, here.", "She was never there. I know that for a fact.", "I literally JUST said that.... Not sure what you're pointing out here.", "Agreed, with many thanks to you for spelling it out with such kindness and wisdom. :)", "Yes, but you\u2019re saying that OP is being callous and uncaring and that no one is thinking of the stepbrother. \n \nYou\u2019re \u2018excusing\u2019 OP\u2019s behavior based on age, but the behavior isn\u2019t wrong. \n\nThis is a lifelong tradition that was just the two of them. Mom didn\u2019t come when she was alive, grandfather didn\u2019t either. That\u2019s incredibly important to a kid, especially one who\u2019s lost a parent and especially one adjusting to a new living situation. \n\nOP offered a different trip with the three of them, just not that particular tradition. Things seemed fine until stepmom got into it. And somehow now this kid is being made to answer for the mess she made. \n\nAnd you and others seem to be holding a teenager and a fully grown adult to the same standards. There\u2019s no equivalency when a stepparent calls a child names and blames them to a kid just wanting their father to honor a commitment that is a lifelong tradition. \n\nOP said they care about the kid\u2019s feelings. \n\nOP did not throw a tantrum. \n\nOP did what any adult I know would do. And dad and stepbrother still could have gone. \n\nOP gives stepbrother time with dad alone. \n\nOP is 15. \n\nOP has lost a parent. Idk if you\u2019ve experienced that yet, but it is indescribable. \n\nI don\u2019t think you understand the word \u2018histrionic\u2019 - an all-caps declaration of shock in a whole I-have-the-vapors Victorian cancan is a more apt example. \n\nBut yeah, I do care, or I wouldn\u2019t be here. And I care because of all those reasons and more. \n\nEven if I were convinced this were a fake post, I\u2019d still care. There are strangers on here piling on a kid and yeah, that\u2019s a reason to point out sloppy reading and sloppy judgments. Also the overdue report that I don\u2019t want to write. But mostly that this is a kid on the internet and adults should have some humanity", "Right. You mentioned that in your original post, I was just saying to maybe mention to sarah that your mom also never went", "\n>Y\u2019all need to read more closely\n\nRight back at you. Jake was upset the dad canceled the trip.", "Clearly not well enough because you want a still young child to forego a tradition for the sake of a kid who already gets a lot of one on one time with his step parent. Op deserves this, again, ONE thing. Op has stated he's willing to let the relationship grow but he just wants to have time alone with his dad. I don't think that's too much to ask. 8 y/o won't be traumatized by not going on one outing a year. They have the whole rest of the year to start a tradition for just the 3 of them.", ">Clearly not well enough\n\nHave you ever gone to therapy because it sure doesn't sound like it. \nYou are fixated on what OP \"deserves\" and keeping score of who does what with whom like keeping score is the way to grow a family.\nRelationships are not like that. One day you'll understand."]}
