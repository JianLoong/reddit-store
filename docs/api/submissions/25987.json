This started before I can even remember. There are photos of us there, just the two of us. Mom didn't come when she was alive and we kept it up after she died.\n\nLast year dad married Sarah. Sarah has a son Jake (8). I'm 15.\n\nSo dad and I had planned our trip for this year and then Jake asked if he could come. Dad told Jake this was just for me and him, and that we could do something else another time. Sarah said it wouldn't kill us to let Jake join and since it was father/son time, he should be there since dad is the other father figure Jake has. So dad said he could come and asked me to be okay with it. I told him I wasn't and that there are other things he coin join in for but this was always our thing. Sarah said I could let my \"little brother\" join.\n\nI waited a few days and the plans were still Jake comes. So I told my dad I wasn't going anymore and that I didn't want Jake to intrude on that but since I had no say, I was taking myself out of the equation. Sarah heard me say this and said I couldn't pull out because Jake wanted time with me as badly as he wanted time with dad. I told her I didn't want the cabin trip to include Jake and it was never meant to include anyone else. She asked dad if he was seriously going to let me just decide to pull out almost last minute. He said it wasn't going to be any good if he had to force me to go.\n\nThe very next day dad decided to drop the cabin trip. Jake was upset and Sarah was furious at me and she said this was all my fault and I was such a spoiled little brat. She said Jake wanted to join us and be included and seen as a part of the family, one of the boys, and I shit all over him. I told her Jake goes bowling with my dad once a month, that dad helps him document bugs. He has his own things with dad and he joins us for other stuff. That I should be allowed one tradition that has been there for years and has always just been for me and dad. Sarah said I was still spiteful and hurt an 8 year old.\n\nI should also add that dad has told me we'll do the trip just us around Halloween because he knows I was right and it should be kept for just us.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693551526, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166zuc1/aita_for_pulling_out_of_mine_and_my_dads/", "score": 734, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was always your thing with your dad, just you and him. Is it a \"boys\" trip? Technically, but i would say this is more a \"OP and dad trip\". \n\nKids are entitled to alone time with their parent in blended families, the step siblings don't have to be invited to everything and your stepmother should not be mad that you're asking for that. Specially considering your dad offered to do something else later so the three of you could go together. Keep the tradition with you + making new ones with the three of you, sounds perfectly fine.", "Sarah sounds like a razor-tongued adolescent, not a mother. Are you sure she's old enough to have an 8yo, or is Jake in fact her little brother?\n\nOP, was your dad in earshot when she called you \\*checks notes\\* a spoiled little brat, spiteful, and someone who s#its all over an 8yo? If not, have you told him about her comments? Because they were *way over the line* for someone who literally married a widower with a teenager, one year ago. \n\nAnyway, NTA. Enjoy the October trip. In future, make it your policy not to talk about treats or parties around people who aren't going to be invited to participate in them. \n\nAnd do what you can to be nice to Jake because he's a helpless pawn in all this... and he has a real piece of work for a mother. He's gonna need you for a big brother in the future, for real.", "Of course NTA\n\nIt is completely ok to have some alonetime with your dad. Even more so, if it's already an established tradition.\n\nJake has already his own stuff with your dad. With that in mind, it's even more ok, that you have your thing with your dad.", "NTA... I'm going to answer as a divorced mom. Let's say I marry someone else who has a child. There's still going to be stuff I do with my son that's just us! Traditions like you said. And there will be stuff I do with stepchild to bond... And stuff all together to feel like a big happy family! An 8 year old isn't old enough to understand. He just hears \"cabin, that's fun I want to go!\" And you're the cool 15 year old he wants to be around. \n\nIt's the mom's responsibility to tell the 8 year old \"No... That's a thing they do alone\". Mom could take Jake somewhere fun. It could be a thing where you go with your dad to the cabin and Jake and his mom go off to make their own tradition on the same days. Then on a different occasion (and a different cabin if needed) have a boys weekend all three of you so he gets to experience a boys cabin! But that's totally insensitive of Sarah to not see your side of it. Honestly how dare she call you a spoiled brat? \n\nIf I were in your shoes it would feel like the vibe of the trip had totally been ruined from having a new kid tag along. You have memories for years of the trip being a certain way. It would be changed irreparably if you changed the dynamic. I don't know if everyone would agree.. but I get it.. and good for you for standing up for yourself. I hope your dad tells Sarah she was out of line for what she said to you.", "Absolutely NTA\nI really hope for your sake your dad steps in with Sarah because if my husband spoke to my son (his stepson) that way, I\u2019d lose my mind. As someone who lost a parent at a very young age, I\u2019d be very hurt and would\u2019ve just pulled out of the whole thing as well. \n\nI hope you have a great trip in October and your dad deals with his gross selfish wife.", "Definitely NTA.

Your dad is completely to blame for telling Jake he could come on the trip before clearing it with you first. It is not your fault at all that your dad messed up like this and Jake's upset is mostly down to him.\n\nThis is, and always has been, a trip for just you and your dad. It is not a snub or a deliberate move to exclude Jake from the family; it is a tradition that you want to continue to nurture with your father and you're not being a \"spoiled little brat\" or \"spiteful\" for not wanting it to change. \n\nI hope your dad is fighting your corner with Sarah, not only because he needs to own up to his mistake, but also her reaction to this really sounds to me like she has it in for you.", "NTA  \nIt looks like you include Jake in other things, but you want to keep this one as only thing you two do. Sarah is AH for wanting to take this from you - even if she just want to make sure Jake is \"one of the boys\" as she is blind for things where HE IS \"one of the boys\". \n\nSarah need to step up her step-mom game, because now it looks like she is father's wife only looking out for her bio-son.", "NTA, this is the time with your dad. Your mom never even got to go.  If you let your stepbrother go this year she most likely will demand to go herself next year.  She is a f-ing AH as she said that your dad is his other father figure.  Does he do things with his dad?  If so are you invited on to go along?  Next time he does something with his dad demand to go along, see how that plays out.", "NTA. You were right to say what you thought.", "NTA, he knows you were right but what? It will take him till Halloween to find his balls? I hope the trip works out for you but I wouldn't hold your breath since your Dad is clearly spinless\n\nEdited to add that I think you should show your father and Sarah this thread, you have been really calm and mature in your writing and are clearly a good kid,maybe seeing other people's opinions might make them see things differently.  It might not get your trip back but I suspect this won't be the last time Sarah throws her toys out of the pram so might be good for the inevitable next time", "NTA, but Sarah is a massive asshole. Be courteous but distant from her and raise that emotional boundary up like a high wall so she doesn't try to overstep again.", "NTA rather than kick up a stink you made your position clear, allowed time for your dad to make his decision, and then when you weren\u2019t happy with the outcome you politely excused yourself\n\ni don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here apart from Sarah, you don\u2019t foster family integration by forcing people together. that just creates resentment", "It\u2019s really concerning that the new wife felt comfortable calling you names. From what I can tell you remained calm and articulated your feelings logically and with consideration. You demonstrated more maturity than her. You need to have an additional talk with dad, about her not treating you with common decency and respect. And that while she is his wife, it doesn\u2019t give her the right to resort to name calling and treating you like she did. And that her attempting to force you into a deeper relationship with her and her son is going to have the opposite effect. You didn\u2019t magically become his brother, and if she continues to manufacture conflict there will never be a chance for one developing organically.", "NTA it is a Tradition for you and your dad and that's it", "NTA\n\nYour dad should have told Sarah No and explained to Jake why this was not his trip.\n\nSarah sounds like an entitled child, and had spoilt your Dad/Son time. I hope you get the Halloween trip.", "NTA, Jake\u2018s a kid but I\u2019m side eyeing his mother and tbh your dad too, because he knows what\u2019s right but isn\u2019t brave enough (right now?) to honestly say so to his wife.", "NTA \n\n I remember this post where a dad asked if he was the AH for not taking stepdaughter with him to paris, and taking only his daughter cause she asked for time with him. Everyone said he is the asshole and that his stepdaughter it's his kid too.

NTA, i would have gone on strike too. I hope you have fun in October op!!!", "What about OPs attitude makes him a good kid? All he's doing is cancelling a holiday because he doesn't want to associate with his 8 year old stepbrother.", "Not yet but I will tell him.", "Yeah gotta say while I understand OP wants his private time with Dad. If Owen was his biological brother he would definitely be invited to this event as well.\n\nSounds like OP just doesn't like his step brother", ">A suggestion: find an activity the three of you can do together\u2026 something bigger than bowling.  \n>  \n>Go. Entertain Jake and be present\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI keep wondering how people think a 15 year old should take on the responsibility for starting, amusing and entertaining an 8 year old that she met recently. \n\nWhere are the parents?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA teenager has their friends, school work and everything else. Many live in their gadgets. Forcing these relationships work against it. Let them find their way to each other.", ">Maybe start a different tradition just you and Jake? Something like taking him to a movie once a month, or video game day, just the two of you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet the teenager be. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does a teenager and an 8 year old that just joined her family have in common? These things need time. It will happen- or not. It isn't on Op to start a tradition.", "Dad isn't planning a second trip with Jake. He's doing other stuff with him. The cabin thing is just for us.", "Sarah is trying to claim every aspect of her husband's life and get child free time for herself.", "Dad doesn't know what she said.", "Was your dad present when Sara called you a spoiled little brat? That whole conversation was childish and inappropriate on Sara\u2019s part. As a parent, I would have never allowed my spouse to talk down to my child. Your dad needs to grow a backbone. He never should have invited Jake in the first place. NTA", "Your Dad sucks for letting Sarah do this, he should've stood up for you. Out of curiosity, your Dad is his \"other father figure\", can I take from that that his Dad is still alive and at least occasionally around?", "To flip over responsibility, where does your step-Mum ever take you? If she wants her child to go with you, then try to barge in on the most inconvenient or expensive activity that she does with her son\u2026", "NTA. This is a you and your dad thing and always has been, if Jake and Sarah are being welcomed into the family in other ways they have no reason not to let you and your dad have this tradition. Even if you were biological siblings you\u2019re still allowed to have alone time with your parents, it\u2019s important to have that bonding time one on one when you can. I understand Jake wanting to go but Sarah should respect this tradition and teach her son that he can\u2019t be a part of everything but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s being left out. You and your dad should have been able to have this trip and maybe take another one with Jake another time. If your dad and Sarah want a blended family to work they need to set boundaries and respect each other\u2019s boundaries.", "He is 15, they have only been married a year.  He isn't here throwing a tantrum like many 15 year olds.  He is happy for the kid to spend time and do things on his own with his Dad, he cares about the child's feelings.  Come on, his mother is dead, this is one thing he wanted for him and his Dad.  Even if the 8 year old was his bio brother that wasn't just new on the scene it is still fine for a child to ask for one on one time", "He wants time with just his father, his remaining biological parent after the death of his mother. Is it that hard to understand?", "This is a textbook example of someone inserting their own shit into a comment. At no point did the OP say he \"doesn't want to associate with his 8 year old stepbrother\". What he said was the stepbrother has things he does one on one with the father like bug collecting and the OP would like to continue doing the one thing him and his have traditionally done together. It really is as simple as that.", "> If Owen was his biological brother\n\nBut he is not. It makes sense that op wants to spend time with just dad instead of having a stranger there as well.", "I\u2019m not suggesting he take over parenting. I\u2019m suggesting he takes his new brother to do something fun with his dad. Build their own tradition for the 3 of them.\n\nThe dad should 100% be planning this\u2026 but maybe the OP doing it will make the step mom happier.", "Jake is gonna be a part of your life for the next 60 years if your lucky. Yes it sucks it is you and your dad's thing. But growing up with step siblings it is easier to extend the olive branch instead of being resentful of what they are taking from you. It makes for a better mental place and a better home life. I have 2 step sisters and a stepbrother. It sucked sometimes, but I am glad they are in my life now.", "I mean, your 15, he\u2019s 8 , emotions are complicated. I think the only A-H here is your dad who \u201cknew\u201d you were right and still didn\u2019t stand up for himself letting it escalate.\n\nTbh it\u2019s not super mature to cry and drop out bc your trip wasn\u2019t exactly what you wanted but you\u2019re 15 so that\u2019s understandable.", "I also have step siblings and you can care about another kid without fully seeing them as a little brother. It takes time to build those kinds of feelings, and some times you get don\u2019t get very strong, as long as you\u2019re kind and treat him like family it\u2019s ok if the feelings aren\u2019t there.", "Then you need to tell him. If she's speaking to you like this behind his back that's worse. He needs to know so he can deal with it. He can't help you if he doesn't know. Also, telling him is a warning to her that there will be consequences and she can't get away with it.", "He wasn't there when she said that. But I will tell him.", "Still alive but not really around anymore no.", "I didn't cry when I told them I wasn't happy with Jake coming along. I explained that I didn't like or want it to happen and when that was ignored I made a decision to drop out. The cabin has always been about my dad and me. That's what I want it to stay. I enjoy having that time with just my dad and nobody else."]}
