Both of us are atheists, but she is culturally Jewish and takes a lot of pride in and celebrates her Jewish identity often. I said absolutely, and asked when Passover was this year. When she said it was on a Wednesday, I responded by asking how the day Passover falls on is decided. I know next to nothing about any religion, but I've learned more and more about Judaism and her Jewish heritage since we've been together. I didn't think much about the question as I asked it - my mind at the time was wondering what the hell the Easter algorithm is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe looked at me like I was dumb, and told me to think about my question. I asked her what she meant, and she told me to think about it. After a few seconds, she said in a pretty sarcastic tone \"it's different every year because it's on the Jewish calendar... it doesn't fall on your Christian-centric Gregorian calendar\". I asked her what that was about and why she responded in such a dickish way and she told me that she was tired of answering questions about Judaism all her life, being part of an oppressed minority group. I told her it was a ridiculous reaction to an innocent question regarding the religion, and that I've asked her dozens of questions about her religion before without her responding in such a way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a little bit she apologized for how she answered the question, but with a \"... but it's only because I've answered dumb questions about Judaism all life\" that followed. She expected an apology from me, but I told her I didn't feel like she deserved one because I asked an incredibly innocent question that wasn't antisemitic or offensive in any way. She told me that as a white Christian male (not a Christian, not sure why she included that) I wasn't allowed to tell her how to feel regarding the matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes my girlfriend deserve an apology for getting upset with her response to my question, or AITA?", "created_utc": 1678063451, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jjbxh/aita_for_asking_my_gf_when_passover_is/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You owe her an apology if and only if you have committed some fault against her.\n\nOh, and she's an AH. The Gregorian Calendar isn't Christian-centric, it's Earth-rotation-centric.

It adds an intercalary month every two or three years to keep the calendar roughly in sync with the Earth.\n\nNTA", "NTA Jewish holidays move and are not on the same day of the week.

Nisan is a month in the Jewish calendar, which is lunar. Because it\u2019s lunar, holidays on fixed dates on the Jewish calendar float around on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nYour girlfriend probably referred to you as Christian because even though you don\u2019t believe and therefore don\u2019t technically qualify as a Christian, I\u2019m guessing you come from at least an ethnically Christian background and may have certain default culturally Christian assumptions.

Why would they be expected to research a religion that they don\u2019t believe in? You are never in the wrong for asking honest and respectful questions about things you don\u2019t know about. \n\nIf I asked her the significance of the 99 thesis\u2019s, she\u2019d have no clue what I was talking about.

I can\u2019t imagine why one would get annoyed at explaining this concept, which is not intuitive and legitimately confusing.

She has been answering silly questions about Judaism all her life. If she gave a shit about you, she could at least answer you. You know why she didn't? Because she doesn't even know.

You're not Jewish, so why on Earth would that be a weird question for you to ask?  You didn't ask it rudely either.

Mostly nonreligious jew here! I can\u2019t call you an AH. I see both sides. Despite Judaism not being her religion, it is her cultural background. and It does get exhausting teaching someone the very basics of your culture and that things that are rooted in Christianity are always what is seen as \u201cnormal\u201d here in the US. interest in learning about her culture is a good thing, and if you took initiative to Google random questions you had about Judaism in the future, I\u2019m sure that would be appreciated", "NTA but you would be if you continue to ask your girlfriend easily google-able things now that you know it\u2019s a burden to her.", "NTA but apologize to your girlfriend.\n\nAlso, since she feels this way about it, maybe learn about Judaism some on your own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
