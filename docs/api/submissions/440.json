She gets easily triggered, and can't handle most things that deal with vomit. Anything to do with people throwing up, or even just the sounds sends her into a panic attack. This hasn't been a problem in the relationship so far, but it certainly has come up while watching TV or videos, so I am careful with what I put on.\n\nEvery week or so, we do a movie night. We alternate who picks the movies and try to pick something that we're both interested in. We share the cost of both the popcorn that we get from a local movie theater and the cost of renting the movie. This week, it was my turn. I chose the movie Knives Out. This movie came out three years ago, so my memory of the plot was a little shaky, but I knew it was an interesting murder mystery that we would both enjoy.\n\nHowever, I completely forgot that the main character throws up whenever she has to tell a lie. The first time this came up in the movie, she looked away and covered her ears, and made it through without much trouble. I apologized profusely, but she was still extremely pissed. I told her I wasn't sure if it would happen again, so we continued watching. The second time it happened it was more difficult to anticipate and she completely freaked out, getting out of the room as fast as possible.\n\nShe started yelling at me and told me she couldn't believe how I could've made this mistake, and left pretty soon after. She told me she won't resolve the conflict until I pay for everything and apologize again. I apologized the first time it happened in the movie and even in the argument after, but I don't feel like I'm obliged to deliver another apology and cover the costs since we always split it. The movie was from three years ago and I feel like I made a genuine mistake, and she completely overreacted.

I've got a sensitivity myself, so I tend to use it if I think there's a chance of a movie containing it", "Nah. You made a mistake. It happens. People forget things, and if you weren\u2019t with her at the time that you saw this movie I can see how it wouldn\u2019t be something that stuck out to you. But when you make a mistake, sometimes you just gotta make it right. Cover the movie. It\u2019s less than $20 and apologize again. Relationships aren\u2019t about who\u2019s right or wrong. Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and accommodate your partner. If she hasn\u2019t done it for you already, she will at some point. Pick your battles. This is not the hill I would choose to fight over. Do you really want to fight over less than 20 bucks, or would you rather move forward and enjoy your time together?", "ESH. She\u2019s allowed to feel triggered and upset over this, phobias can inflict severe emotional responses. You apologized and made a genuine mistake.\n\nBut from what I see online, this movie is at most 10 bucks to buy and seems like a petty thing to have a lasting fight over. Do a quick skim next time or any movie that might potential trigger her and move on.", "Info. Given her phobia, do you guys have an agreement to pre-check movies for inclusion of vomiting? If so, was it your responsibility as the picker to do that? \n\nIf not, you aren\u2019t TA, but you his probably need to start doing some googling before picking a movie.", "Esh. It was your accident. Sometimes we have to pay for accidents, even if it's silly. And in this case, it is. Send her 10 bucks and y'all move on to the next silly fight", "NTA - you forgot and she didn\u2019t do any investigation of her own into the movie before seeing it, nor did she demand to leave the theater. She ate the steak.", "Info: what is this, like $10? $5 each?", "I guess you are going to die on the hill of her phobia. She means so little to you that you can't take her flowers, $10 and a sincere apology. \nTHEN, you guys need to establish guidelines for how movies are picked. And a \"no yelling\" rule if that is important to you. \n\nMy #1 relationship rule is:\nBe Kind.", "I wasn\u2019t sure how to judge this at first, so I just googled \u201cknives out vomit\u201d. Took me 10 seconds to learn there is vomiting in the movie. Turns out, I\u2019m more considerate to your girlfriend\u2019s phobia than you are. YTA. Pay her back, apologize, and tell her that you will be sure to Google your suggestions before suggesting them.", "ESH - \n\nSince she's the one with the intense phobia, she should be expected to manage her needs by doing a quick google before watching the movie. She's an adult, she can be responsible for her safe space. \n\nBut you're her partner, so you can show you care by also doing a quick google and showing her some empathy when it goes bad. Panic attacks are AWFUL and can leave you feeling nauseous and drained for days. I can understand why she wants the strong apology. I don't get why either of you are quibbling over the  money, but again since you picked the movie and had seen it before, i can see why she's making the demand.", "NTA Give her some time and space. Then explain how it was a genuine mistake and for her to think, does she honestly think you don't care about her and did this on purpose? You're human just like her and mistakes happen. If she can't see that ypu did not mean this then you may need to talk out more about the future.", "ESH.\n\nYou could have easily checked before picking, but managed to pick a movie where vomit is a major plot element. Kinda shitty. And her reaction was over the top, she shouldn't have yelled at you. \n\nIt's not that much money, just apologize and pay the difference, hopefully she apologizes for yelling, and make checking part of your routine from here on out Doesthedogdie even has a category for it.\n\nhttps://www.doesthedogdie.com/does-someone-vomit", "NTA but this is glimpse into the resto of your life with this person.\n\nIt's not that you made a mistake or that you triggered her, it's how she responded.\n\nLots of people get triggered. She chose to stay after the first instance of it happening, yet refuses to accept any responsibility for that decision. Triggers happen and they're emotional but usually the person calms down and can see they might have overreacted. Your girlfriend seems extremely self-centered and entitled. I'd kick her ten bucks and then drop her like a hot potato.", "NTA. Phobia or not, that's no excuse for her to act like an entitled brat.", "\u201cEmetophobia\u201d\ud83d\ude44.

This woman derived zero enjoyment out of this movie, was repeatedly faced with the object of her phobia, and making her pay for that privilege is just plain rude.

You didn\u2019t even care enough about her to check the plot for vomit. You honestly sound like you did this on purpose.

But phobias, by definition are irrational.  They elicit strong, visceral emotions.  She directed hers at you, unfairly.
