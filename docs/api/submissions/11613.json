Truth be told, if your father is actively dismissing you, then his behavior may be the source of this, and it might be worth a proper conversation with him. But if it\u2019s just insecurity warping your perception of these people and their intent, then you need to do some soul searching. Again, I suggest therapy", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re mad that your wife has a really cool job and bonds well with your family?

Well that's sort of fair, but it's essentially a problem between you and your father.\n\n>I feel like lesser of a man in my father's eyes\n\nWhere's your mother in all this? The rest of your siblings? It sounds as though there are other family members, but you have this laser focus on your father.

I bet your wife doesn't give a damn.\n\n>and she's the successful one, and I resent her. I hate how much she tries to remind me of my failure to achieve\n\n... Because you decided to do something different with your life? Mate. Your failure here is of failing to root out your father's shitty influence and stop chasing the approval of someone who doesn't deserve to bestow it. That's it. \n\nLook, this sort of shit often happens when we have a long rift with parents and then go back to a childhood home. We suddenly regress to our childhood or teenage selves, and it can be terrifying. And super disconcerting. But it can be temporary.

I could see your anger if something happened that caused you to drop out of school and you missed your chance at bring an engineer but again,  you chose to go in a different direction.  That's a choice you now have to find a way to live with. I promise you the whole \"my wife thinks she's better than me\" is probably all in your head.

We're meant to thrive on each other's successes, not be bitter - especially when you've committed to loving and supporting someone for the rest of your life.\n\nYou genuinely should consider seeing a therapist who can help you work through all of the things you've got going on.", "More than everything else, I think you need therapy to discuss your relation with your dad. The rest will follow.", "YTA. You sound like you have daddy issues, but redirected your anger at your wife.", "INFO: Does your wife literally \"tries to remind me of my failure to achieve\" as in, is she saying those words to you? Is she directly saying \"you failed!\" - or is it simply that you THINK and IMAGINE she thinks that because you aren't an engineer? \n\nIf she is, then N T A. If she is not, then YTA.\n\nAll jobs have value. We don't know your job, but let's say you teach high school science or math. Valuable job right there. Molding young minds. Heck, invite dad or wife in as a special guest. Maybe you manage a restaurant. Great. People have to eat. Take pride in that job. \n\nIt's on you to love your own path and not assume others look down on you.", "YTA. Your friend is right. Who told you to marry an engineer if you are jealous of anyone who achieves your former dream? Why should your wife be punished for being one? Get a grip. Alternatively, go back to school and become one. Stop stressing people out unnecessarily.", "YTA\n\nWhat career are you currently in? What did you end up studying? You can\u2019t be surprised that your dad and wife are bonding over something they both care a lot about. You need to realize that this isn\u2019t your wife\u2019s fault and it\u2019s you feeling like you\u2019ve failed at life because you and your dad were estranged or you aren\u2019t finding fulfillment in your current career.", "You\u2019re not less of a man over your job, you\u2019re less of a man because you are overflowing with toxic masculinity. Yeah yeah your feelings are valid bla blah but what\u2019s NOT valid is treating your WIFE and family like shit. Get a fucking divorce if you\u2019re unhappy. Let her have a good man she deserves. Not whatever shell of a man you are. Get some therapy. YTA.", "YTA. Go to therapy because this isn't healthy.  You're wife and dad aren't doing anything wrong other than talking shop and existing.  You chose a different path for yourself, stop punishing your wife for choices you made because you're now unhappy with them.", "INFO: Look, I\u2019m not gonna call you the AH for having feelings of inadequacy. But what are you going to do about it? Is your plan to stay mad at your wife, blaming her? Do you have a long-term elaborate plan to bring down her self-confidence? Or are seeking healthy ways to get better and deal with your feelings? \n\nReally, what is your plan? You are already hurting the people around you over your feelings that at least your wife didn\u2019t cause. Are you even sure that she acts like she is better than you or might that just be in your head?", "I don\u2019t man, kind of, maybe you should talk to your wife about this, I\u2019m sure she isn\u2019t doing it on purpose, unless she is which would make you definitely NtA.", "Nta. Leave her.", "ESH Your feelings are yours to deal with and therapy along with cutting out your father will probably help. That said, what kind of partner watches their spouse become more bitter and in pain because bonding with their shitty FiL is somehow more important. Is she married to you or your dad?", "While it is okay to feel what you are feeling, those feelings have nothing to do with your wife and her actions. They have everything to do with how you view yourself, where you are in life, what your father has done, and how he is treating you now. \n\nWhat your father has done by choosing a career path for you- was wrong on so many levels. I am sorry he did that. Parents who act in these ways set their children up for extreme disappointment and to feel as if they are inadequate or even failures. Your father should be supportive and encouraging of what you chose to do in life; within reason. \n\nWhere your wife is concerned, you are looking with a clouded eye. The feelings coming from the situation with dad are skewing the view of your wife's actions. You are lucky to have family that enjoys spending time with your wife; the majority of people dislike their in laws. \n\nSo while it is normal for you to have these feelings, what you do with them from here on out is what makes you TA or NTA. \n\nWill you continue to attribute thoughts and feelings to your wife that truly come from you even though they are a direct result of your father's poor parenting? Or will you focus on the good things about your wife, your marriage, what you love about her, and the good things in yourself so you can be the goodan, husband, and father you want to be? \nThe choice is up to you.", "The latter, but she seems really smug and self righteous like oh look at me im so much better than you, but thats only when my father is around", "Yeah, this is definetly a \u201cyou\u201d problem OP.", "Learn to bloom where you've planted yourself... that's lovely. I'm stealing that. \ud83d\ude00", "Yeah this is what gets me. OP chose to change careers and not pursue engineering. OP chose to marry someone who did pursue that goal and is now a successful engineer. Now OP is choosing to feel hurt by the fact that she is successful in that field and putting all the onus on her when all she is doing is living her life.\n\nDon't get me wrong OP's dad was wrong to put such heavy expectations on him and to put such a weight on engineering. But OP is the one reading into everything and resenting their wife for existing.\n\nAs others have said OP you need to either flourish where you're at or go back to school and become an engineer. Either way you need to recognise that none of this is your wife's fault these are the consequences of your actions and your dad's unfair expectations.", "From other comment. Question:\n\"INFO: does your wife literally remind you of your failure to achieve, or is it just her mere existence and job occupation that reminds you of it?\"\n\nOP's answer:\n\"The latter, but she seems really smug and self righteous like oh look at me im so much better than you, but thats only when my father is around\"", "Yeah please see the rest of my comment and consider therapy. Maybe even paired with couples counseling. Have you brought up these concerns with her? Maybe your wife is acting smug. Maybe she isn\u2019t, and you\u2019re projecting. But you need to talk to someone. This isn\u2019t healthy.", "So, you were the one who \"failed\" as per your own words but everyone around you is at fault for you being unhappy about it and snappy?\n\nWhy be with your wife? For her money she brings in?\n\nOtherwise I don't understand how you can be so callous to your own partner.\n\nGo to therapy.\n\nGo NC or low contact with your family.\n\nDivorce.\n\nWhy be miserable and make other people miserable?\n\nDo you want your wife to lose her job? For real, honestly.", "The real issue here is your father, not your wife. I hate to say this, but therapy might be the way to go here. If it helps, you may also need to go LC or straight up NC with your dad for a while until you get your head back in the game.\n\nWe here don't care what you do, we're all here for you and want to see you succeed and be happy in life.", "What a prize of a husband you are! Why did you marry this woman? Was it so you can sneer at and belittle her to make yourself feel great? I hope she leaves you soon, you don\u2019t deserve a partner until you\u2019ve sorted yourself out", "You\u2019re such an asshole.\n\nYour wife deserves better. You feel inadequate? Get over yourself.  You made your choices in life.  It you are unhappy with that, get therapy.", "Why are you with someone you clearly resent? It\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t love your wife. YTA and not a good person. I feel so bad for your wife to be married to you.", "It seems like you are projecting an awful lot on to her that has more to do with your own insecurities about being perceived as a failure by your father than anything she's doing. Their conversations aren't related to you and yet you're taking them personally.", "Does she make that obvious that she\u2019s being self righteous or can only you tell?", "Why did you marry her then?\nI\u2019m sure when you met she was already studying it/about to start or already working in the field. You still chose to be with her\n\nYTA", "What is the OK way for your wife to look when talking to your father?", "To be honest I\u2019m not sure I do want to see this guy succeed, I don\u2019t like the way he talks about his wife."]}
