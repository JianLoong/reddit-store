Truth be told, if your father is actively dismissing you, then his behavior may be the source of this, and it might be worth a proper conversation with him. But if it\u2019s just insecurity warping your perception of these people and their intent, then you need to do some soul searching. Again, I suggest therapy", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re mad that your wife has a really cool job and bonds well with your family?

You don't notice for a bit, until sometime comes in and yells that you're bleeding. You realise that blood is pumping out of your hand at an alarming rate and it really hurts. Do you:\n\n**A**. Sit on the floor wallowing in the pain and yelling *I'm allowed to feel what I feel!* \n\n**B**. Realise that the pain and blood are signs that something is wrong and seek help fixing the problem?\n\n>To say I feel left out would be an understatement.\n\nOK, that sucks.

Well that's sort of fair, but it's essentially a problem between you and your father.\n\n>I feel like lesser of a man in my father's eyes\n\nWhere's your mother in all this? The rest of your siblings? It sounds as though there are other family members, but you have this laser focus on your father.

I bet your wife doesn't give a damn.\n\n>and she's the successful one, and I resent her. I hate how much she tries to remind me of my failure to achieve\n\n... Because you decided to do something different with your life? Mate. Your failure here is of failing to root out your father's shitty influence and stop chasing the approval of someone who doesn't deserve to bestow it. That's it. \n\nLook, this sort of shit often happens when we have a long rift with parents and then go back to a childhood home. We suddenly regress to our childhood or teenage selves, and it can be terrifying. And super disconcerting. But it can be temporary.

I could see your anger if something happened that caused you to drop out of school and you missed your chance at bring an engineer but again,  you chose to go in a different direction.  That's a choice you now have to find a way to live with. I promise you the whole \"my wife thinks she's better than me\" is probably all in your head.

Was it because of what you both are together or what you aspired to be an \"engineering couple?\"  That's also something to figure out.  At the end of the day, you marry someone for the lifestyle that you feel comfortable sharing together.
