You established your boundaries and she smashed through them. And she did it at your workplace, not cool.", "NTA.

She did it to feel gratitude from you.", "NTA\n\nYou had boundaries in place and your gf ignored them. Plus this wasn't like a home office, right ? So that might have been unprofessional as well. And might reflect badly on you in the workplace.

But decorating the space was too much.\n\nEdited.", "NTA. Forget that you don't like surprises. Who goes to someone else's job and decorates their office. It's totally inappropriate.", "NTA", "NTA. You clearly outline your boundaries and communicated them on your feelings about birthdays. She made it more about her. Obviously birthdays mean something to her, but that just means HER birthday can be full of surprises and decorations.", "NTA!! You were specific about how you feel and she invalidated your request. The decorations were about making her feel good and not you.\n\nEarly in their relationship, my SIL threw my brother a surprise birthday party. When she invited our family, my mom and I both said he wouldn't like it. He doesn't like surprises or parties. He prefers low-key interactions with small groups of people. She said he told he her the same thing, but everyone really loves surprise parties.\n\nWhen he walked into \"his\" party and realized what it was, he walked right back out, got in his truck, and left. They almost broke up over it.\n\nFor 30+ years, his birthday has been celebrated with a cake made from a box mix after a regular weeknight dinner. He loves it", "NTA.\n\nHe said he didn't want to acknowledge his birthday. She didn't just disregard request, she made a big public display instead.\n\nIf she wants to ignore her partner's wishes, she should at least do it privately. Invading his workspace was inappropriate and potentially embarrassing.", "NTA. I think she really overstepped. She went to your job, which is weird unless she works there too. She did something you specifically told her you don't want. She ignored your feelings about birthdays and invaded your work space. It was a bit of an AH move to make her take them down,you could have just ripped them down yourself. Overall I think she was in the wrong here.\n\nIt would be different if she put up decorations at home but doing it at work means now your coworkers have been alerted that it's your birthday and they are going to be bothering you all day. It just adds another level of annoyance for someone who doesn't like their birthday or having the attention on them.", "Boundaries are keys. If she knows you don't like it, why is she forcing it ? NTA.", "NTA. All of these people are considering their feelings over your own about your birthday. Why the fuck should you have to take down birthday decorations for a birthday you never wanted to celebrate? That\u2019s so fucked up for her to make you do. You told her your boundaries and she couldn\u2019t leave it alone because she wanted to make herself happy not you.\n\nI absolutely when people make my birthday about them wanting to celebrate despite to the fact that I do not celebrate my birthday because I don\u2019t want to. Birthdays already feel shitty enough and SPECIALLY it\u2019s worse when the little that I want (which is nothing from anyone else) but to respect my boundaries and leave it alone are ignored and disrespected so others can feel good about themselves. \n\nCleaning up decorations for a celebration you didn\u2019t want is a slap in the face and adding insult to injury. Not your fault she refused to respect your boundaries and she needs to take responsibility for that. It shouldn\u2019t be a big deal for her to recognize that\u2019s not what you wanted and clean it up.\n\nYou especially do not owe someone thankfulness for something you made clear you didn\u2019t want. \n\nEx: \u2014tells partner doesn\u2019t like diving. \n\n\u2014-Partner buys YOU tickets to go diving as if it\u2019s a gift for you because they like it, despite the fact that you don\u2019t \n\u2014 tells partner not interested \n\u2014 partner is mad at you because they did it for you?? Why the fuck would they do that??? How is that for you?? You told them you didn\u2019t like it. \n\nWeird and manipulative to expect you to be grateful for acts they are doing for themselves.", "NTA. \n\nI also don\u2019t care for surprises or birthdays and I HATE when people assume that I\u2019m lying. She needs to listen better.", "NTA.\n\nShe didn't listen.  You were clear in saying that birthdays are not a big thing for you and that you don't like surprises.  If she wanted to make you feel special, she would have respected the boundary you set.  It's not a moral failing to not want to celebrate your birthday.\n\nShe did all of that decorating for her own satisfaction and probably thinks you're the AH for not wanting it, or thanking her for the gesture in spite of your request.", "NTA,  you were clear and she decided to ignore you and your wants.", "Having her come to remove the decorations was a full-on dick move but for the rest of it?

So, even though her intentions were good, she assumed wrongly, maybe projected what she likes unto you, went too far (at your workplace ?!) and got burned for it. \n\nMaybe lower down on the response though and the making her take everything down, that wasn't kind. I assume you let your frustration do the talking there.\n\nShe needs to work on listening and respecting boundaries, you need to work on your tact and diplomacy.\n\n(If she did project what she'd like to receive for HER birthday onto you, remember that gesture, in case you are in need of ideas in the future)", "NTA. Significant others should NEVER go to your office or do anything related to your work without your express permission. She violated several boundaries here, and wanted praise for doing so.\n\nAlso, INFO: does your girlfriend have weird insecurity issues/has she ever made any insinuation that someone at work likes you/you like someone at work? I feel like this could be even worse, like a passive aggressive marking of her territory by doing something so embarrassingly showy. \n\nShe needs to grow up.", "Big YTA she fies something special for you and not only don't you thank her you act ungrateful. 'i made her cone take them down' I would of told you to get fucked, hopefully she'll wake up and leave your selfish ass soon.", "ESH. It's decorations ...not a surprise party. You didn't like it, just tell her. Asking her to take them down was ridiculous. It would take a few minutes but instead you treated it like a consequence of her actions. If he had made you a cake would you Bruce Bogtrotter her and make her sit and eat the whole thing.", "Nta \nShe could've decorated your place or something or got you a cake instead", "honestly i'm kind of conflicted but leaning more towards YTA. it's not that hard to act a little happy about someone trying to do something special for you. you can let them know in a nice way that you love that she was thinking of you etc but in the future you'd rather not have surprises like that. making her come take it down just seems a bit \"punching someone who's already down\".", "ESH  she shouldn\u2019t have crossed your boundaries and you should have had an adult conversation with her without feeling the need to force her to come BACK to your workplace and take them down.", "This is an esh for me. If I knew my boyfriend didn\u2019t like surprises, I wouldn\u2019t waste my time but I can see how maybe she thought this was a toned down version of the surprise she would have given you if you DID like surprises. You seem more indifferent to birthdays than flat-out against them, you said it\u2019s just another day. Maybe she underestimated your dislike. She, for some reason, thought you WOULD be excited. \nI think a conversation would have been nicer than flat out ignoring and making her take them down. Especially like\u2026 making her come back to take them down rather than just taking them down yourself.", "Easy YTA. I'm gonna take a wild ass guess that you are on the spectrum. The complete lack of empathy and the absolutely self-centered viewpoint you wrote this story from is a cause for concern.

Which is a problem in itself.", "YTA\n\nMan I mean I understand \u201cbirthdays aren\u2019t my thing\u201d, but like unless you\u2019re one of those \u201cmy dad died on my birthday so I don\u2019t like being reminded of that by celebrating my birthday\u201d you could at least put in SOME sort of effort to not be a kill joy.\n\nYour girlfriend tried to do a nice and fun thing for you only for you to be super unappreciative at all, and not only that having her come and take down the decorations?\n\nIs it that hard to say \u201chey thanks for the birthday surprise it was cute!\u201d And then taking them down yourself? YTA.", "NTA, go men! And you", "Yep. YTA", "Yes, YTA. Not seeing birthdays as a big deal doesn't mean you can't understand the significance of her going well out of her way to show you she loves you.

YTA", "YTA and I honestly don\u2019t know why so many people are saying you aren\u2019t. \n\nEven if you told her not to make a big deal out of your birthday, decorations in your office are hardly a big deal.

You didn\u2019t take this into consideration at ALL, and instead of politely communicating something along the lines of \u201cI appreciate how much effort you put into doing something you thought would make me happy, but I really don\u2019t like birthdays and would prefer if this kind of thing wouldn\u2019t happen in the future\u201d, you chose to completely ignore her and make her take them down? :( \n\nI can only imagine how sad it must have been for her to be sitting around so excited for you to notice her efforts just to be completely ignored.", "YTA. You were ok until you made her come & take them down. Big asshole move.", "YTA if it\u2019s not a big deal why are you making such a giant production out of rejecting it, and in the process, your girlfriend? \n\nThe essence of this is that she wanted to do something nice for you.

I would have cried if someone did that for me. So fricken rude dude.", "Birthdays are a big deal to you, because you acted like an a\\*hole when your gf tried to do something celebrate.

You should have pretended to be grateful that she loves you.", "YTA . At least pretend to care about her effort. It cost nothing.", "Your gf was trying to do something good ffor your birthday.  You ruined that.  Simply shutup about the decorations and take them down later.  Did you need to punish her?", "YTA, for the way you handled all of this.\n\nJust to be clear you are not TA for not wanting to celebrate it but you are TA for the way you went about telling her.

How did she even get into your office? Usually places have badges or security for access, so she probably planned in advance with a coworker.

You have something that a lot of people will never get to experience in their lives, and you are taking it for granted.\n\nI hope she recognizes this reaction for what it is, because I imagine it'll continue like this for years to come.

In any case, OP is TA any way you cut it, because whether birthdays are a big deal to them or not, the girlfriend put effort into showing OP how much she cares about them, and OP cruelly threw her loving gesture back in her face. Bigtime AH behavior.", "Where does it say it is the first birthday? I might've missed it.\n\nThat's the right way to say it if it was home.
