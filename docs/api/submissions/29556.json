If she can't cut out eating out so much, there's no way the next step is \"charge an 18 year old rent.\"\n\nIs she working?  Can she get a better job?", "NTA. I'd be suspicious of any parent who thought of others before they thought of their children. Even a spouse. It's great that you are able and willing to support your son. Contrary, your wife sucks for rather having an 18 year old student pay rent than skipping some restaurant visits.", "NTA - yeah\u2026 her seeing your son as potential income is a bit troubling.", "NTA\n\n\nThe root of the problem is over spending. Her fix to have your son finance her is kinda ridiculous. You were right to look over the books and find ways to cut back.", "NTA. Your wife wants a college kid to pay rent to live in his own home so she can eat out more often. It's not even like you guys are in financial dire straits. She just wants your son to bankroll her lifestyle. Sounds like she needs to get a job.", "You had a kid at 14? \n\nBut NTA, you did right by your son and your current wife needs to adjust her attitude, maybe look for a better job herself if she wants a higher income household.", "NTA. She was arguing **she'd rather charge your child rent then eat less take away**. Like, what. \n\nWhat you said was kind of an AH move, but completely justified and I would have said worse. You don't marry someone with kids then expect them to put you first. You just don't.", "NTA. You don't charge your kids rent. You just don't. If she's that concerned about finances then she can cut spending or find a job for herself. It's hypocritical that she's living rent free, but wants to charge your son rent.", "The audacity to tell an 18 year old who is in college and partially paying his tuition to pay rent when his own stepmother isn\u2019t contributing to the income is astounding.", "NTA. But I sort of think you are missing the point. You say she\u2019s a SAHM so you have younger kids with her right? \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want your son there. We need more money, let\u2019s charge your son. No we can\u2019t cut expenses from A, B, C, or D. We need to charge son rent. She has no alternative. She has no compromise. She has no suggestions. She wants to make it hard for your kid to live in your home. It might be time for a talk about more than money. \n\nYou might also want to ensure you\u2019ve provided for your son in your will if you haven\u2019t already. Don\u2019t assume she will help him with what\u2019s left to her.", "I may get a lot of hate for this, who knows but here are my thoughts. \n\nKids don\u2019t ask to be put in this world. Completely out of their their hands. To add to that, they get no say in what kind of household they\u2019re entering. \n\nWhile countries have their own ways of legalizing social movements and parental decision making, we can all agree that it comes down to parents unless it breaches the \u2018regular\u2019 legal/social constructs put in place. \n\nWith that said, when you choose to have kids, just because one turns 18 doesn\u2019t mean you can kick them out, have them carry the load that should be ascribed to the parents etc. To add to that, when you choose to have kids, your priority should be the family unit. Not just singular members. And so, I would be on the view that investing in your kid(s) would not only set them up for the future, but in return, while you may not expect it at all, your kids would take care of you. As someone who has parents, I acknowledge the investments and sacrifices my parents made for me and I prioritize taking care of them even more if it\u2019s within my means. So the simple idea of giving up meals out seems like a no-brainer to give your kid a leg up. I\u2019d even argue that there\u2019s an even greater emphasis on setting them up sooner than later given the current financial-socio-political and everything else climate. The idea of making your own way is very difficult for younger generations, they were handed a pretty s***ty hand. \n\nI commend you for your position. NTA. Your wife however needs to do some soul searching as to the kind of parent she wants to be.", "NTA she\u2019s trying to force out your son. You should talk to your son about what ELSE she\u2019s said or done to him that you don\u2019t know about. He could be keeping silent just so you could be happy.", "NTA. So your unemployed wife is raising hackles at your barely-legal son who is somehow supposed to hold down a job and study full time so she can continue to afford to eat out. \n\nReally ? If you\u2019re short on money there are two options: cut down on expenses or the unemployed *partner* finds a job. Your son has a job - he\u2019s studying.", "NTA it seems like your wife only wants to charge your son rent at this point. The fact that there are so many other options and she doesn't want to do that. Of course that's your child that's gonna come first that's both of yours priority. Talk to your wife about this. If she doesn't change her mind then you need to put your foot down and fight.", "NTA. But she is.She might think after he turns 18 her role as stepmother ends. But it doesn't. Your son is your family!", "NTA your kid should always come before your spouse especially if it is a step parent since you can never be sure they have your kid's best interest at heart.", "NTA. I would normally say it's better left unsaid that one's child comes before the significant other because this is a given and everyone knows it, so there's no need to keep stating it openly and rubbing the other person's nose in it. But in this case, I think she pushed you. Demanding rent from your 18-year-old is not her decision to make, and she made a point of forcing a comparison between her and your son. She should have known she would lose that battle.", "NTA, Your wife should get a job as quickly as possible before she thinks she criticizes other people's financial decisions. If it were both of your incomes, she could have a say in the matter, but in this particular case she couldn't because she doesn't go to work.", "NTA at all. That's how it's supposed to be.", "NTA. So your wife is not able to support herself, but she expects and 18 year old student to support her dining habits? That's nuts. I don't mean to offend, but I am genuinely curious - how did you end up with someone like that?", "NTA. She should get off her arse and start working if she\u2019s concerned about money. Or stop eating out, you don\u2019t need to do it so often and you shouldn\u2019t be spending that much eating out", "NTA\n  You're saving a shit ton of money with your son living at home. Does she realize how much more you'd be spending if he lived in dorm and had on campus meals? If he wasn't going to school or actively working on becoming an independent adult,  charge him, but that's not the case. \n  My husband and I both know our kids always come first, we wouldn't want it any other way. We chose to have them and care for them, not just for 18 years. She needs to realize if she makes you choose, she probably won't like the choice.", "There's several good reasons for charging an 18yo rent. Financing their parents' lifestyle is not one of them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour son comes before any consideration you owe his step-mother. Your priorities are straight.", "SAHM is not really a thing for an 18 year old. They\u2019re pretty independent, or should be.

If she is worried about money, she needs to cut down on luxuries. It's what everyone does when money is tight. \n\nWhen I was 18 and working casually, I paid $50 a fortnight in board. Same with my older sister. However, it wasn't to get money from us because they were short, it was to help teach us financial responsibilities.", "Your wife wants to profit off your son so she can continue indulging in takeaway? Parenting doesn't end at 18, 25 or... ever. Your son will always be your son, and I commend you for living up to your obligation to always be there for him. He is studying and will soon be entering a world that is much more financially challenging from when we were young. Help him make his way, and if you're lucky he will return the favor in your twilight years. Your wife is acting Luke a spoiled brat. Maybe it's time to work out a budget and live within your means.", "NTA.  \n\nHe is your son and ultimately the decision comes down to you.  Everyone has different parenting styles.  Also I can see from the comments below that your wife doesn't work, so if she's really that bothered about it, she should get off her butt and do something about it.\n\nHowever, your son is old enough to get a job and I personally know a lot of parents that do this.  It's never an overly large amount of money, usually a certain percentage on how much they make.  My own parents did it, and there's no shame in teaching your kids the value of money and that in this life they do have to work for things.  It also made budgeting as an adult easier as I had it drilled into me for such a long time.", "NTA  \nYou probably could have been a little more diplomatic. I would ask if shes paying 50% of everything, rent, food, bills etc.  \nIf she is, shes technically, paying for him to live there and its not entirely unreasonable.   \nI live with my GF and her daughter and pay 50% of everything, and while I love her like she's my own (ive been in her life for over 10 years now) and I have absolutely no problem with paying for her until shes on her feet.
