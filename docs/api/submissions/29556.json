Her fix to have your son finance her is kinda ridiculous. You were right to look over the books and find ways to cut back.", "NTA. Your wife wants a college kid to pay rent to live in his own home so she can eat out more often. It's not even like you guys are in financial dire straits. She just wants your son to bankroll her lifestyle. Sounds like she needs to get a job.", "You had a kid at 14? \n\nBut NTA, you did right by your son and your current wife needs to adjust her attitude, maybe look for a better job herself if she wants a higher income household.", "NTA. She was arguing **she'd rather charge your child rent then eat less take away**. Like, what. \n\nWhat you said was kind of an AH move, but completely justified and I would have said worse. You don't marry someone with kids then expect them to put you first. You just don't.", "NTA. You don't charge your kids rent. You just don't. If she's that concerned about finances then she can cut spending or find a job for herself. It's hypocritical that she's living rent free, but wants to charge your son rent.", "The audacity to tell an 18 year old who is in college and partially paying his tuition to pay rent when his own stepmother isn\u2019t contributing to the income is astounding.", "NTA. But I sort of think you are missing the point. You say she\u2019s a SAHM so you have younger kids with her right? \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want your son there. We need more money, let\u2019s charge your son. No we can\u2019t cut expenses from A, B, C, or D. We need to charge son rent. She has no alternative. She has no compromise. She has no suggestions. She wants to make it hard for your kid to live in your home. It might be time for a talk about more than money. \n\nYou might also want to ensure you\u2019ve provided for your son in your will if you haven\u2019t already. Don\u2019t assume she will help him with what\u2019s left to her.", "I may get a lot of hate for this, who knows but here are my thoughts. \n\nKids don\u2019t ask to be put in this world. Completely out of their their hands. To add to that, they get no say in what kind of household they\u2019re entering. \n\nWhile countries have their own ways of legalizing social movements and parental decision making, we can all agree that it comes down to parents unless it breaches the \u2018regular\u2019 legal/social constructs put in place. \n\nWith that said, when you choose to have kids, just because one turns 18 doesn\u2019t mean you can kick them out, have them carry the load that should be ascribed to the parents etc. To add to that, when you choose to have kids, your priority should be the family unit. Not just singular members. And so, I would be on the view that investing in your kid(s) would not only set them up for the future, but in return, while you may not expect it at all, your kids would take care of you. As someone who has parents, I acknowledge the investments and sacrifices my parents made for me and I prioritize taking care of them even more if it\u2019s within my means. So the simple idea of giving up meals out seems like a no-brainer to give your kid a leg up. I\u2019d even argue that there\u2019s an even greater emphasis on setting them up sooner than later given the current financial-socio-political and everything else climate. The idea of making your own way is very difficult for younger generations, they were handed a pretty s***ty hand. \n\nI commend you for your position. NTA. Your wife however needs to do some soul searching as to the kind of parent she wants to be.", "NTA she\u2019s trying to force out your son. You should talk to your son about what ELSE she\u2019s said or done to him that you don\u2019t know about. He could be keeping silent just so you could be happy.", "NTA. So your unemployed wife is raising hackles at your barely-legal son who is somehow supposed to hold down a job and study full time so she can continue to afford to eat out. \n\nReally ? If you\u2019re short on money there are two options: cut down on expenses or the unemployed *partner* finds a job. Your son has a job - he\u2019s studying.", "NTA it seems like your wife only wants to charge your son rent at this point. The fact that there are so many other options and she doesn't want to do that. Of course that's your child that's gonna come first that's both of yours priority. Talk to your wife about this. If she doesn't change her mind then you need to put your foot down and fight.", "NTA. But she is.She might think after he turns 18 her role as stepmother ends. But it doesn't. Your son is your family!", "[deleted]", "NTA. I would normally say it's better left unsaid that one's child comes before the significant other because this is a given and everyone knows it, so there's no need to keep stating it openly and rubbing the other person's nose in it. But in this case, I think she pushed you. Demanding rent from your 18-year-old is not her decision to make, and she made a point of forcing a comparison between her and your son. She should have known she would lose that battle.", "NTA, Your wife should get a job as quickly as possible before she thinks she criticizes other people's financial decisions. If it were both of your incomes, she could have a say in the matter, but in this particular case she couldn't because she doesn't go to work.", "NTA at all. That's how it's supposed to be.", "NTA. So your wife is not able to support herself, but she expects and 18 year old student to support her dining habits? That's nuts. I don't mean to offend, but I am genuinely curious - how did you end up with someone like that?", "NTA. She should get off her arse and start working if she\u2019s concerned about money.

If she is worried about money, she needs to cut down on luxuries. It's what everyone does when money is tight. \n\nWhen I was 18 and working casually, I paid $50 a fortnight in board.

Parenting doesn't end at 18, 25 or... ever. Your son will always be your son, and I commend you for living up to your obligation to always be there for him.

Also I can see from the comments below that your wife doesn't work, so if she's really that bothered about it, she should get off her butt and do something about it.\n\nHowever, your son is old enough to get a job and I personally know a lot of parents that do this.  It's never an overly large amount of money, usually a certain percentage on how much they make.  My own parents did it, and there's no shame in teaching your kids the value of money and that in this life they do have to work for things.  It also made budgeting as an adult easier as I had it drilled into me for such a long time.", "NTA  \nYou probably could have been a little more diplomatic.

However, you\u2019ll be with your spouse the rest of the time", "How long have you two been together? Do you have kids together? I think it\u2019s a low blow to tell your spouse your adult kids will *always* come before them (sure your kids will come first depending on the situation, but your wife should as well), and I do think you two have a LOT to discuss and work through if you want to make your marriage work. Your wife needs to get a job\u2026she\u2019s 30 but wants your 18 year old to help fund her life? Wtf? I can understand starting to charge rent after he graduates, but this whole thing sounds like a mess. I\u2019m going to go with NTA because I\u2019m assuming you two haven\u2019t been together a very long time (but again, y\u2019all need to figure out your marriage and you may owe her an apology for what you said). I also don\u2019t like if she\u2019s singling out your child (again, speculation as I\u2019m assuming y\u2019all have kids but she wouldn\u2019t intend to charge them rent).", "It\u2019s like they wouldn\u2019t be a kid at that point and they\u2019d be grown. And grown people have bills. So you\u2019d rather mess up your situation with your home and wife, to support another adult instead of raising them to be able to pay bills at 18? It\u2019s like if your wife wasn\u2019t going to come first, why even be married? Your wife/spouse first, then kids.", "NAH\n\nSounds like typical relationship issues. I will say though, any couples therapist you go to will tell you in order to have a successful marriage you must first prioritize your marital relationship above all other relationships (including children) in your life. So if you are fine with watching your marriage go down the drain I would suggest keeping on the path you're on.", "I would never tell my wife that my kids are more important than her, what a shitty insensitive thing to say. You both seem like assholes.", "YTA for saying that to your wife. Your son will grow up and leave.  Your wife may leave to because you're TA. Your wife needs to compromise.  Your son should be allowed to live  rent-free. Does your wife work? Maybe she should get a job.  .", "Yep YTA.  You might not be TA if you worded it better, but saying \"my son will come before you\" is really not healthy in a relationship.  Think about it- in 4ish years, your son will be a man living on his own and you'll only have your relationship with your wife.  Your spouse should be a high priority, as you'll be with her for the next 60+ years.\n\nMore realistically, you shouldn't be choosing favorites.  Her concerns are valid, as are yours.  These are the types of things you have healthy discussions about, not \"kid #1, you #2\".  You are going to have to stop supporting him at some point.  And she needs to participate in budgeting too.", "You an ah for enabling this situation. How do you have a whole housewife but eat out so much?", "YTA... not for the situation at hand but for saying your son comes first. What was in your marriage vows?\nIf you're Christian, the Bible tells you to forsake all others for your spouse. My point is, don't marry someone you don't plan as putting first in your life.", "Right? 50-100$ per meal? WTH. Wifey can work if she\u2019s worried.", "This right here!! What is she doing to help contribute to the family finances? Charging your 18 year old son rent to improve the family financial situation is way it of line.

Even if it's your spouse you have great relationship (Married/separated not an issue) with biological children?

Parents have a greater responsibility to their kids that they just don't have with anyone else. Anyone that thinks that they matter more to their partner than their kids is suspect", "I think its normal to think of your partner too. Support should be situational not unconditional. In this case the support should clearly be towards the son. But if you always (unconditionally)put your kids needs/wants above your partner, you should never re-marry, because its unfair.", "In the situation they mentioned, where the complaining spouse was vocal about money like this, I'd personally be suspicious that they were running up debt they weren't telling me about. \n\nMaybe those concerns aren't coming from nowhere.", "You're suspicious.

OP's son has a part-time job and pays part of his tuition.", "Where\u2019s the asshole line? He didn\u2019t say anything remotely out of bounds. No sane woman should take offense that a man puts his children first. That should be an attractive quality if anything.", "> She was arguing she'd rather charge your child rent then eat less take away.\n\nFor a certain perspective, it sort of amounts to having the kid pay for her takeout food.", "Mostly agree. I think there is a time when you can charge rent, but at 18 and going to school is not the time. Maybe after they graduate and find a full time job, but even then I would take that money and stash it away for them.", "It\u2019s not that black and white. Some parents don\u2019t have a lot of money, others save the money because they don\u2019t want the young adult to squander everything and so on.", "Oof I know this is a hot take, but I was charged rent when I turned 18 and I think it was a good way to slowly introduce me to the real world. But it depends on the personal situation; I had a job and I paid a ridiculously low rent, a rather symbolic one. Some kids have longer school days/afternoon activities/no job or a hard time in school if they need to focus on something else. \nSo in some cases it's totally okay to charge rent. \n\nI'm with you on the whole rest \ud83d\ude05", "I charged my adult children a very small rent. It wasn\u2019t about needing the money, however, it was to get them used to the responsibility and to encourage them to be productive.

I was doing my postgrad degree and living at home, with two jobs on the side - that rent money went towards food and energy bills primarily. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a necessarily bad thing to charge rent, especially if it\u2019s lower than what a college/university would charge to live on campus.

My mom struggled a lot so when I got a job I did start pitching in here and there but that was my own volition and had to do some heavy convincing, plus it was either that or be homeless.

The child-parent relationship will only be physically in the same place for 18-22 years, whereas in the spousal relationship, you'll be physically together for the next 60-90 years.  It's sooooo unhealthy for a marriage to put kids first, and it's actually unhealthy for the kids too.  It's much better to focus on having a strong marriage with the kids by your side, to set an example for how adults should behave in the real world.\n\nThis \"helicopter mom/dad\" \"kids come before everything\" culture from the past 20ish years is not doing anyone any favors.  It's making the kids less independent and the parents much less happy.  Kids thrive from being provided for and guided from a high level, but not led by the hand in life.", "This isn\u2019t accurate.

Just not the day he turns 18.\n\nAt a certain point you have to start treating your adult children like full independent adults. People you hopefully have a great affection for, and a want to help - for sure, that's the ideal. But If your 28 year old child, let's say, wants to live at home, there's nothing wrong with asking them to pay a modest rent, even if the only reason is for the the reduction of space for the parent, or to prevent them from getting complacent living on your charity.\n\nI don't believe it makes any sort of sense to ask of a fresh 18 year old, because they well and truly are not in a position to fully support themselves. But from 18 up you should definitely be moving your relationship away from Support-Provider/Dependent, toward peers. At a certain point in the lives of otherwise healthy people, you become as capable of self-sufficiency as your parents. And eventually more capable, as your parents age. At that point your parents should be focused more on prepping for their elderly years when they will lose their ability to earn more and continue to support themselves, moreso than supporting another adult.\n\nFor all that people (rightly) complain about parents who treat their kids like adults at the stoke of 18, it's not good either for parents to always treat their children like dependents who require one-way support. I think it's gross to want to profit off your children, for little to nothing in return for them. But it's perfectly healthy to charge a modest rent to a mid-twenties-plus child. And it's equally gross for a full grown adult to choose to live off their parent's support to the detriment of that parent, long term.

I am sure there are stay at home parents that do have it rough, kids with special needs probably take more work than an office job, I don't envy them for being in a parental and care provider role, that's exhausting, but being a stay at home parent is definitely not hard compared to majority of jobs out there, especially if the kid is a teenager or an adult.
