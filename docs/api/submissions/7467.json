That being said don't just give him no boundaries or rules because that's an other issue all together. Thing is you're going to push him towards what you don't want. Kids do better learning from your behavior and over reacting to an otherwise good kid doing something stupid (not even the worst of stupid things teens do) isn't teaching him anything other then don't get caught. \n\nYou've gone past the point of punishing his behavior and are now controlling him. That's going to backfire big time.\n\nAlso you're not his parent. Ya you're his older brother but it's not your job to invade his privacy and dictate/control his every movement.

Not with that hand, anyway.\n\nAnd they seem to understand that people need privacy and trust. Have you met people with too overbearing and strict parents who control too many aspects of their lives?

My guess is that your parents have allowed you to take over aspects of their responsibilities for a long while - even if they say not to, they leave things in a way that doesn't make you feel fully safe and cared for so you feel you need to step in. \n\nPlease hear this: that isn't healthy or normal. \n\nParenting is their job and you clearly feel they aren't doing it well enough. But stepping in for them here will only alienate your brother while stressing you out. If anything, this behaviour is more likely to incite further drug use than to inhibit it, though I see you have good intentions here. \n\nThis isn't your job and you aren't equipped to do it.

Weed is fairly harm free for a developed brain but for a child it can definitely have negative effects.", "I won't down vote you, but I'll say the fact he wants to supercede his parents authority makes him the AH. He doesn't get to decide more punishment for his bro because he feels his parents are wrong.", "OP isn\u2019t even trying to understand or speak to his brother. He is literally just trying to control his every move and is even resorting to threatening him whenever he leaves the house. If OP did anything you said in your last paragraph then I would have voted not TA too but he\u2019s going about the whole situation the wrong way.", "You are acting like he his brother got away scot free. OP is tripping because he feels that he wasn\u2019t punished enough.", "Did you miss the part where the brother was punished?  One month grounding for a single joint seems more than fair and even a little heavy handed.", "Your comment feels similar to saying \"You're not the asshole here. Your method of torturing that guy who went 20 mph above the speed limit may not be effective, but they DID speed a lot while they only just had their license. You should just talk to them about the dangers of speeding instead\".\n\nOf course OP didn't torture his brother, but he did do an extreme punishment for something relatively minor. How on earth does that not make them an asshole?", "Parents took it pretty seriously, they grounded him for a month.", "LOL", "Ok so assuming all of what you said is true (which I highly doubt), the little brother doesn't even know about that because the brother didn't tell him.", "They grounded him for a month. What else do you want them to do - invade his privacy like you do?", "Who are you to decide that? Why are your superdraconian policies correct? Who approved of those policies outside of yourself?", "HE IS NOT YOUR CHILD. This is an issue with you and your parents then. This is alarming behavior. \nAlso, you are under your parents roof. Move out if you don\u2019t agree with their methods. Holy hell.", "YTA You have stated you are 20yo. If they aren\u2019t doing their job by keeping a roof over your head and you know better it\u2019s time to move out and start your own family. Then you can set your own boundaries", "They did do their job. They grounded him for smoking weed which isn't more harmful than cigarettes. \n\nBtw ppl like you are why people move to hard drugs and drinking. \n\nThe lack of respect and invasion of privacy...\nI'd be grounding you for a month.", "And why do you have to take over a job that only you decided was needed in the manner you are doing it?\n\nParentification isn\u2019t healthy.\n\nStop being a parent to your brother, and go back to being a brother.\n\nI am totally against drugs myself, but you can\u2019t prevent it the way you are doing it. And while doing so, you ruin your relationship with your brother and hinder your own life.", "If they did a worse punishment he probably would get more rebellious \n\nLimitations are good but it\u2019s also important not to be too overbearing because it can do worse than doing nothing(which they didn\u2019t do nothing)", "Says whom? You? Please stop making your brother\u2019s life miserable. This could lead you to finding a place to live.", "If you're really concerned about him, perhaps try something like I dunno, talking to him. Telling him how disappointed you were in him. You know stuff like that. \n\nYou're making this bigger than Ben Hur and if anything it's likely to push him towards drugs not keep him away. \n\nTeenagers do dumb shit, they also rebel. Try being approachable so he can turn to you for help and advice rather than taking on a role you're clearly not mature enough for.", "The parents who know best are always the ones without kids. YTA. Leave the parenting to your parents and back off.", "And neither are you, as his older brother.", "Until he makes it your problem.   He might be smaller than you now, but he's 14, he going to be adult size very soon.   Won't be as easy to bully around.", "Then why did you come here if you made up your mind?", "Lol what a clown.  Imagine being so young and confident about a terrible move.  Enjoy him now before he goes NC with you over this", "Being a helicopter-sibling won't stop him, just make him not tell you anything. Keep it up and he'll never want any sort of relationship in the future. You might be fine with it now, but when family gathering happen and he won't talk to you. He walks away from any attempt you make to communicate. You hear it from others, that he's getting married or he's now a father. You'll be asking 'what happened, we use to be so close'. This is what happened. You gave yourself authority that is not yours.\n\nedit: YTA", "The thing is, you can't guarantee that you're \"not letting him do drugs.\" You're not around him 24/7. He could be smoking weed in between the times that you call him.

Seems like you're the one with the problem.", "He would hate you for invading his privacy and bossing him around.\n\nIf he wants to do drugs, he will do it anyway.", "YTA You sound controlling- i can see a Reddit post about you in a few years written by the person you are dating on how you are controlling. Stop it. Get a grip and focus this effort on yourself.", "Calling you or picking up the phone saying \"yeah we are at x location\" does not mean he is not smoking a joint, is not going to smoke one and/or will not smoke one. He could be doing lines of cocain in the toilets of the mall for all you know.\n\nThe best way to prevent drugs from becoming a problem is to treat him responsibly: tell him of the dangers, explain why you care, put him in front of the consequences on your health when smoking so young, etc.\n\nBeing on his back all the time and telling him he has lost his brother's trust and love somehow too (he must feel that way) is not the right thing you think it is.\n\nYou are 20 so you are quite immature still but trust people on this thread: you don't know what you are doing and don't see the damage and resentment you are building.\n\nYTA.", "Eh.. 'concerned' is tricky here.\n\nI don't disagree that it is probably not healthy. I'm not versed on the science or neurologic.. or really anything weed, tbh.. I only do crack.. but it probably isn't postive for mental development, sure.\n\nBut with only a joint and parents already punishing I don't think it is reasonable for OP to be 'concerned'. Although I definitely agree with the sentiment that it is great he cares about his brother.", "Sure, but smoking weed underage one time at a party is like drinking underage one time at a party.  Not great, but not life-altering.", "Trust me, he does not care what you think. You are just the sand in his urethra right now.", ">I can't just tell him I trust him to do the right thing when he clearly won't.\n\nWhat makes you think this, exactly? Does he have a history of repeating bad behaviours or lying? Or is it just because he got caught smoking weed once and thats literally it?\n\nI think YTA here, but mostly to yourself. From what i've gleaned, your just damaging your relationship with your brother.\n\nPlus, if your brother feels like you dont trust him, hes not going to trust you either or come to you if something down the line happens he wont feel like he can consult his brother. That's not what you want is it?", "You're supposed to be on his side. That doesn't mean you're \"endorsing drug use\". Be a good role model. The reality is, he probably wouldn't \"endorse\" everything you do, but hopefully he doesn't try to police you.\n\nAnd the reality is, trying to spy and control him is not going to stop him anyway. Let your parents handle that.\n\nAnd also, relax. It's just weed.", "Parenting 1:1 - if you keep telling a child that he/she is not to be trusted, the child will soon realize that whatever they do or don't do still leads to the conclusion that he/she cannot be trusted. Therefore, why bother.\n\nSame with lying. If you always assume a person is lying, the person in front of you will not have anything to lose, so why bother. Truth, lies, it doesn't matter. Just pick something that will keep the argument away for a while, because they think you are a liar anyway.\n\nYou do not have proper parenting skills, so stop damaging your brother.", "So do you think people can never learn? Do you think that someone who served 6 months in jail should have their privacy invaded for the rest of their life? Do you think people who speed should have their speed checked by a cop every day the rest of their life?", "Such a 20 year-old narrow-minded opinion. It's always absolutes with that age group. \"If I leave him alone, well it's like I'm basically handing him a crack pipe!\" \"He did one bad thing, so he is clearly headed for a life of crime if I don't intervene with my whopping two decades of wisdom\"\n\nYou're just wrong. Plain and simple. At some point, it would behoove you to step back and recognize that you don't know everything.", "It seems like  - just from what you've written here - that you're relishing your new role as jailer for your brother. Are you gaining some kind of power-trip from what you're doing? It's unhealthy to behave this way. YTA. This seems more about what you feel than over any real concern for your brother and his future.", "Many studies on the criminal judicial system have shown that over the top punishments aren't very effective.\n\nA more effective method might be to ground them for one weekend and in that weekend talk about drugs and their effects. And more important, make sure that the kid can always go to his parents if something is wrong instead of not doing that in fear of punishment.", "Right but if he\u2019s going to disrespect his parents request and authority why should he be allowed to stay there for free?", "A single joint is not enough to do anything", "Punishment isn't the same thing as teaching. Grounding a kid is just teaching your kid to be more secretive to avoid punishment. I get that it's common but it isn't effective. You actually need to understand why he did it and work together to find alternatives for the future. Discipline is teaching not punishing.\n\nUnfortunately it's clear that it's their primary parenting tool since it's the one OP it's massively overusing here. My guess is that OP saw how their parenting impacted him and wants better for his brother but doesn't have the tools to deliver it so he's just maxing out the only option he's ever been shown.", "Lord I hope he doesn\u2019t. OP is in no way, shape, or form ready to start his own family. He has a LOT of maturing to do. He has no clue what boundaries are.", "Is it likely OP\u2019s brother is smoking one joint and will never try another drug? Not really. Grounding for one month and not doing any more work to educate OP\u2019s brother about drugs, addiction, peer pressure is not the way to go, although neither is OP\u2019s methods.", "I want to know if his parents know what he's doing.  Do they know that he's searching his brother's room?  If not, maybe little brother should let them in on the secret.", "Sure, but a habit is. Im not saying this guys reaction is the correct one, but drug use in children is something to take very seriously, and i say that as a pretty drug liberal person.", "I have inadvertently given the worst advice in my life. For that I apologise", "How do you know the parents didn\u2019t talk to him about it?  OP is not privy to every private conversation the brother had with his parents.", ">Is it likely OP\u2019s brother is smoking one joint and will never try another drug?\n\nNah probably not but it isn't some gateway crazy shit like the DARE officer and OP would seem to have you believe. I'd only be concerned about him immediately jumping to black tar heroin if he also mentioned he wanted to be an accountant or something\n\nAnd yeah agreed that parents should teach kids about the substance.. and it seems like we also agree that OP really shouldn't be the one to do anything here", "There is no indication of a habit. In fact he was caught sharing a joint, so the brother might not have even got high. Then the brother decided that being punished was not enough and started invading his bother\u2019s privacy. OP is just a bad person.", "They very well may have done, hence why I said OP should speak to his parents. \n\nMy point is that his concern is valid.", "Even if this just developed into a small weed habit, at 14 I would put a stop to that\u2026if I was the *parent*, which is where OP\u2019s assholery came in.", "Again, i wasnt commenting on OPs behavior but rather on your dismissal that a teen smoking weed was nothing serious.", "How his parents punish his brother is none of his concern", "Yah, agreed", "His brother being safe and healthy very much is his concern, though.", "He is not entitled to information from his parents in this case. His parents dealing with it and that is where it ends. He is NOT there co-parent.", "I don\u2019t agree. He\u2019s not a co-parent but he *is*  family; the grounding was certainly made obvious enough. He\u2019s within his rights to raise concerns about his brother\u2019s safety. If his parents say they\u2019re dealing with it then that\u2019s the point at which he stops and lets them take it forward, but they\u2019re not there yet from the sounds of it. \n\nThis is all ancillary though, my point was that dismissing a 14 year old smoking weed simply because it\u2019s \u201cnot crack\u201d is silly."]}
