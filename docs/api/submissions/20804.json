I took what some of you said into consideration: perhaps I just needed to be more patient. I decided if the noise issue escalated, then I\u2019d do something. Otherwise, I would just suck it up (and use headphones like some of you advised). \n\nWell, today, his children screamed/shrieked four times within a one hour period in the hallway. This was right by my door about two feet away from my apartment. The fourth time it happened, I opened my door and said \u201cplease don\u2019t scream in the hallway, guys!\u201d \n\nOnce I said this, he told me that his kids are allowed to scream in the hallway (or anywhere else in the building) that they feel like. I told him that actually, no, they\u2019re not, according to our lease. He then told me to suck it up and to contact management and to not talk to him. \n\nAfter our conversation, he told all three of his kids \u201cyou can be as loud as you want in here!\u201d and then shot me a nasty look, and proceeded to walk to the stairs. Once he said that, all three kids started squealing as loud as possible, on purpose. \n\nI sent management an email and they are talking to him first thing in the morning. I know some of you suggested I do this in the first place- I wish I did!", "created_utc": 1687956840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l8r7b/update_aita_for_leaving_a_note_on_my_neighbors/", "score": 790, "replies": ["Better take some recordings as proof, otherwise \u201cloud\u201d is subjective.", "Record  for your evidence and if it continues have the property manager come by while its happening..", "You should also get a cheap decibel meter and record the noise volumes when his kids are being loud\n\nDocument Document Document\n\nIf you can prove a behavior of excess noise over time, it will help give the management team the ammunition they need to force him out of the complex/building", "Please take action we need to teach these kinds of people.

I hope they deal with it appropriately.", "Please update again later", "Please post another update after they talk to him", "After reading your first post, I commend you for taking the note down and trying a different approach.

I hate people who just let their kids be loud and obnoxious. If anything, I\u2019d suggest you do whatever you can to make him feel how you feel if the management doesn\u2019t do anything.

He\u2019s definitely the AH and he needs a taste of his own medicine", "NTA after you spoke to him.  There is a time and place for noise and in front of your door is not one of them. Dad was being vindictive when he said that.", " Play some music when the kids have gone to bed.", "There's nothing wrong in you trying to talk to him.

He's now non-verbal, 2 1/2, melts down over everything and everyone stares at me. He's at the age where you can tell something's off because he's so standoffish but he's a toddler so everyone wants to be close. He pushes people away reflexively, in the aisles when they lean into him, if he's uncomfortable. I bought a big pin that explains his autism and put it on his back while shopping. Everyone leaves me alone now and has 'compassionate eyes' that bother me; but at least nobody's upset at my Benjamin anymore (to me). At first I was going to say ask about disabilities.

I would have no compunction about complaining about this dude.", "Did you know you can freeze urine in a thin sheet and it can slip right under someone's door?", "Leaving a note is usually a pointless route and confronting someone if it's not your Strong suit will get you where you got.

If he is nice about it and makes a difference we are done.\n\nStep 2 - if he's an asshole or it doesn't stop - never talk to him again. Collect evidence and talk to management \n\nThat's basically it.

I kinda like the idea I saw in another post of you screaming 2 feet from his door, lol!  I mean, if it's okay for his kids, should be fine for everyone else, right? \n\nYou're NTA here...your neighbor has just clearly demonstrated that he is.  Poor kids.", "You went to the neighbor first to try to address it and got an unsatisfactory response, so you are NTA for escalating to the next level.", "NTA\u2026so you can be as loud as you want in the hallway?   Are there other neighbors?   If so, I would have a chat with them about gathering and being loud s few times in a week and when the neighbor comes to complain\u2026\u201doh?
