I took what some of you said into consideration: perhaps I just needed to be more patient. I decided if the noise issue escalated, then I\u2019d do something. Otherwise, I would just suck it up (and use headphones like some of you advised). \n\nWell, today, his children screamed/shrieked four times within a one hour period in the hallway. This was right by my door about two feet away from my apartment. The fourth time it happened, I opened my door and said \u201cplease don\u2019t scream in the hallway, guys!\u201d \n\nOnce I said this, he told me that his kids are allowed to scream in the hallway (or anywhere else in the building) that they feel like. I told him that actually, no, they\u2019re not, according to our lease. He then told me to suck it up and to contact management and to not talk to him. \n\nAfter our conversation, he told all three of his kids \u201cyou can be as loud as you want in here!\u201d and then shot me a nasty look, and proceeded to walk to the stairs. Once he said that, all three kids started squealing as loud as possible, on purpose. \n\nI sent management an email and they are talking to him first thing in the morning. I know some of you suggested I do this in the first place- I wish I did!", "created_utc": 1687956840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l8r7b/update_aita_for_leaving_a_note_on_my_neighbors/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Better take some recordings as proof, otherwise \u201cloud\u201d is subjective.", "Record  for your evidence and if it continues have the property manager come by while its happening..", "You should also get a cheap decibel meter and record the noise volumes when his kids are being loud\n\nDocument Document Document\n\nIf you can prove a behavior of excess noise over time, it will help give the management team the ammunition they need to force him out of the complex/building", "Please take action we need to teach these kinds of people.
