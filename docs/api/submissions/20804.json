I took what some of you said into consideration: perhaps I just needed to be more patient. I decided if the noise issue escalated, then I\u2019d do something. Otherwise, I would just suck it up (and use headphones like some of you advised). \n\nWell, today, his children screamed/shrieked four times within a one hour period in the hallway. This was right by my door about two feet away from my apartment. The fourth time it happened, I opened my door and said \u201cplease don\u2019t scream in the hallway, guys!\u201d \n\nOnce I said this, he told me that his kids are allowed to scream in the hallway (or anywhere else in the building) that they feel like. I told him that actually, no, they\u2019re not, according to our lease. He then told me to suck it up and to contact management and to not talk to him. \n\nAfter our conversation, he told all three of his kids \u201cyou can be as loud as you want in here!\u201d and then shot me a nasty look, and proceeded to walk to the stairs. Once he said that, all three kids started squealing as loud as possible, on purpose. \n\nI sent management an email and they are talking to him first thing in the morning. I know some of you suggested I do this in the first place- I wish I did!\n\nUpdate 2.0: I just went down to the management office to follow up with the manager. She said she had a meeting set for today at 1pm with the resident (she immediately contacted him when I emailed her last night). But then today, he emailed her saying he could no longer make the 1pm meeting and asked why he had to come down (he\u2019s in his apartment right now doing nothing\u2026 he doesn\u2019t work). She told him he is in violation of his lease and it\u2019s best if he comes down. Apparently, he didn\u2019t reply to her. She told me that if he doesn\u2019t come down to meet with her, she is going to draft an official lease violation letter and begin the process of eviction. I was blown away (she\u2019s a great manager). She told me that his reaction (telling me his kids are allowed to yell & and telling the kids to keep yelling) is the reason for how she\u2019s handling this, not purely the noise complaint. She said she\u2019s horrified and disgusted that somebody would handle the situation this way. Her and I both agreed that it was strange he would encourage me to \u201cnot speak to him\u201d and to \u201ccontact management\u201d rather than just simply telling his kids \u201cshhhh\u201d and appreciating I said something to him directly.", "created_utc": 1687956840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l8r7b/update_aita_for_leaving_a_note_on_my_neighbors/", "score": 8709, "replies": ["Better take some recordings as proof, otherwise \u201cloud\u201d is subjective.", "Record  for your evidence and if it continues have the property manager come by while its happening..", "You should also get a cheap decibel meter and record the noise volumes when his kids are being loud\n\nDocument Document Document\n\nIf you can prove a behavior of excess noise over time, it will help give the management team the ammunition they need to force him out of the complex/building", "Please take action we need to teach these kinds of people.

OP having compassion for the brats.  \n\nStick to your guns OP cause this'll get worse once that notice is sent out.", "[deleted]", "Yes, you are.", "The great part, at this point, is it\u2019s no longer about the noise. Then he instructed his kids to violate the lease. Then he made the biggest mistake\u2014not showing for the meeting.", "Lol he shot himself in the foot by telling you to take it up with management! Bet he\u2019s regretting being a such ass now that he\u2019s going to get himself evicted", "Bruh I taught my dogs the command \u201cinside voices\u201d if they\u2019re being too loud and rowdy. I don\u2019t get why people can\u2019t do the same with their kids. It\u2019s not hard, it just takes a modicum of self-awareness.\n\nBut maybe that\u2019s just my innate introverted traits trying to keep me from being a bother to others.", "WHY would it mattter if the guy was depressed.\n\nWHY do other people have to pick up \"your\" slack that  you can't even be bothered taking care of?\n\nWhat is it about bleeding hearts that you guys always blame the INNOCENT person for being \"mean!!!!\". \n\nOH until it happens to YOU, that is. \n\nSuch a classic depiction of our society today.\n\nAlso funny you can't even control your own house.", "What?", "I\u2019ve honestly been thinking about that all day long. I\u2019m sure he wishes he just had a civil conversation with me rather than telling me to report him lmao.", "Ha, I did almost precisely the same thing when I was in my early 20s - subwoofer aimed at the wall, signal generator, etc.\n\nWorked out the next morning that I'd been aiming it at the wrong wall and kept the nice quiet neighbours awake instead. Felt bad", ">: \n\nI dream of doing this to my asshole neighbors. I hate nyc.", "That's awesome, I did a similar thing I built a sub with a 12-in speaker with a 550 watt RMS amp and when my neighbours would have an annoying party which would involve putting really bad pop songs on repeat I would just leave my midi equipment on a loop with just the kick and a bass playing and lo and behold their music would stop.", "My parents tell this story that they had an asshole neighbour who'd throw loud all-night parties, so in the morning - when said neighbour was trying to sleep off the hangover - they'd turn their massive speakers against the wall, crank the volume up to max and put Meatloaf's 'Bat Out of Hell' on repeat, then just go out for the day.", "Most likely op isn't the only one who confronted him about it. When possible it's not the only he says that to!", "THATS AMAZING, I wish my landlord would invest in something like that, what a business concept!", "Leaping to bizarre conclusions is kinda the MO around here.", "I don\u2019t think OP should be trying to get him evicted. We don\u2019t know his situation, but he has kids (however loud they may be) and that might be all he can afford. Obviously he was ridiculously petty and escalated the situation, but the kids can\u2019t be blamed for this, they\u2019re kids, and whatever happens to him (presumably) happens to them", "A display of power without the use of force.\n\nLike the sound of a shotgun being pumped but not fired.", "Idk I could imagine someone getting in the mood with flight of the valkyries. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I dunno,  Mike Wazowski is pretty good at capturing screams", "Engineers call mics mikes sometimes.

And his brother was named Richard. I wish I was joking.", "Watch out for prison Mike though, that guy is weird.", "Maybe I dont have the whole story but it someone told their kids to scream on purpose then I just don't believe it. For all I know the dad can be an asshole and does it on purpose. Who knows if the people around him were mean to him before this all happened. If there wasn't an apology involved then I will 100% lean towards NTA. But maybe we'll just need to wait and see how the eviction plays out to see if the dad's behavior changes.", "> Maybe I dont have the whole story\n\nExactly. (No \u201cmaybe\u201d about it.) So STFU until you do."]}
