Secondly, I hope it\u2019s okay to say this title is pretty funny.\n\nYou kind of ask the question in two conflicting ways so I can\u2019t really give a judgment, but I\u2019ll just say if you think your mother would be comforted by seeing the statue, you should give it to her, but you should also not scare her to death. Let her know that you found it and wanted her to see it. Maybe it will provide her some comfort.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nYou should absolutely message your mum and let her know what you did though, before she notices it, since YWBTAH if your lead your mother on like that.\n\nI think it\u2019s sweet that you want to comfort her, but making your mother think that her daughter\u2019s ghost had visited her could pose problems in the future that you probably haven\u2019t considered yet. Best not to interfere with her grieving process and just let her know what you did.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was driving home and was like oh shit! \n\nThink I should text her I put something for her on top of the hutch, then she can be surprised by what it is?", "I am going to call her first thing in the morning. I think me calling this late might scare her more in the moment.", "I would just call or text and let you know what you found, and where you put it. That way she can prepare unless it would be shocking for whatever reason.", "Why do you want it to be a surprise? Just text her and tell her. This is probably not a great time for emotional surprises.", "Just text her \"Hi mom, I forgot to tell you I put sister's statue on the hutch, I hope that was OK.\"\n\nNot everybody thinks a surprise is a good thing.", "That\u2019s fair.\n\nI\u2019d be less worried about scaring her and more concerned about leaving her with what seems like concrete evidence that her daughter had visited her. That sort of thing can lead people to make terrible decisions, like hiring expensive mediums, refusing to move no matter how badly they need to, it can also lead to serious depression if they believe they were contacted once and were never contacted again.\n\nIt\u2019s fine though, your heart was in the right place. Grief can lead people to do silly things. \n\nI hope that your grieving process is easy and thorough, and that you can enjoy the comedy of this situation someday (because this story is actually quite funny despite the morbidity)", "Honestly it may bring her peace to think her daughter is making peace from beyond the grave. You may ruin it for her. Just leave it alone and if she says anything, gently tell her."]}
