I'm going to start from the start. My sister and I are our parents (m(62), f(59)) only children. My father went to Harvard, and my mother attended Johns Hopkins and works as a pediatrician. I work in the tech industry, and graduated from MIT with a degree in comp-sci.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile my sister got pregnant at 20 (they got married at 18), and kept the child, despite our parents saying they would pay for the abortion. My parents stopped paying for her education after that, and for lack of better terms, left her to her own devices. She dropped out, and her husband continued, getting his bachelors in comp-sci 1 year later.\r  \n\r  \n8 years removed from this, I work at a top tech company. I live alone and make over 6 figures. My family have all reconciled, and my sister and her husband have moved back for his work. During dinner last night, the conversation shifted to what their life was like while we were estranged, and my sister brought up how tough it was on their own, but they made it work. During this, they brought up her husbands degrees, and my father and I chuckled when she mentioned he'd gotten his masters degree in comp-sci, as he'd gotten it from one of the worst schools, and got his MBA from an online university, so essentially both were papermills.\r  \n\r  \nTalks then went on to how much he was making, where he mentioned he was set to make over 300k. When hearing this, I was in shock and told him to prove it, to which he asked \"why, don't you believe me\", and both my father and I both said no. This clearly insulted him a bit and he said he had nothing to prove. We then went back and forth until he said something about half the cost (regarding his degree cost to mine) and double the reward (in regard to his salary to mine, I'd shared my salary with my sister earlier in the year, guess she'd told him). This caused a bit more disagreement, with my father and mother defending me, until they had to go back home as their baby sitter (f 20) had classes the next day.\r  \n\r  \nOn their way home, my sister sent me a screenshot of his salary, and told me how disappointed she was in myself and our parents for how we'd acted. I then sent her an angry voice message about why she wouldn't tell me about this earlier, and how she should have defended me because anyone would be in shock with all the facts. She then responded saying my parents and I were bitter because he was more successful than us at a younger age. I then told her to not come to my parents house until both she and her husband apologized. I decided to stay at my parents house for the night as I didnt bring a car, and didn't feel safe walking or calling a taxi late at night. As I was sitting with my parents, my mother then says we were all too hard on them, and he had good reason to be a little boastful considering how we'd treated them. My father and I strongly disagree, as we believe he should have been more respectful all things considered.

Knowing that someone like him earns 300k shattered your worldview. You couldn\u2019t process how someone could be earning well without family support and prestigious degrees. After not believing him, insulting him, you still expect them to apologise?\n\n> why she wouldn\u2019t tell me about this earlier\n\nmaybe she didn\u2019t want to belittle your achievements in the same manner you did theirs", "You and Daddy dearest are bitter snobs. At least your Mum sees error of her ways and hopefully there is hope for your sisters relationship with her. \nYTA.", "YTA and an incredibly judgemental person. \u201cMy sister got pregnant at 20\u201d like this is some moral failing. She was married with a husband so in a stable relationship - no comment about the husband\u2019s involvement in the pregnancy of course. And how awful of your parents to withdraw financial support because she wouldn\u2019t bend to their demands to have an abortion.", "YTA.\n\nYou act like you are entitled to sneer at him simply because he didn't go to as prestigious a university as you did, and then demanded your sister apologise for... not telling you how much he was making?? Because that's information you apparently get to demand now? \n\nYou are incredibly elitist and condescending, and were not only unbelievably rude to your sister and her husband, but act like you are entitled to be as rude as you like to those you perceive as being inferior. \n\nYou should apologise to both of them and then take a good hard look in the mirror.", "YTA - you and  your parents were acting like entitled, elitist snobs.  Your sister and BIL made it through a very hard time and came out on top and you and your parents sound envious of that fact.", "YTA. Sister is spot on, jealous over their success. Your sister sounds like a lovely person and you all sound bitter over your \u201cpunishment\u201d not keeping them in the dirt. Good for them.", "YTA. Your father is, too.   \nYou expected your sister to fail - actually, the family set her to fail by cutting education support to her once she rejected their offer to pay for the abortion - and she did not.\n\nYou are jealous that your BIL made it big even with his \u201cpapermills\u201d education. His success threatens your value system and hence you\u2019re hurt and jealous.\n\nHe did not need to prove anything to you, for you and your father to accept him at face value. Yet, when confronted with the truth in the form of a screenshot, you still angrily blamed your sister who did not tell you this in advance. So basically, in your mind she is the a\u2026hole for making you look bad.\n\nYou did this on your own, friend. You\u2019re a narrow minded, jealous bigot. Such a big, big a\u2026hole that all envy passes through as a rotting green melting pus.", "YTA - Well your family is elitist. Why did your parents stop paying for your sister's education after she had a child? Why did they want her to get an abortion? Her body, her life, her choice. And no only elitist snobs would be shocked by his income thinking it had any correlation to where he went to school. Your sister and her husband have nothing to prove to you and your parents. She and her husband have a happy and successful life despite her family abandoning her for having a child. She and her husband should be proud of their lifes. And they are right they don't have to prove a damn thing to you. He should have been respectful of what? That you went to a better school than him? That he makes more than you? That he didn't bow down to your elist snobby attitudes?", "YTA. I'm laughing and choking at you and your father's audacity. Firstly, IF you really did go to MIT I'd expect you to know that the term is \"Diploma mill\", not \"papermill\", but I expect you are exaggerating just a bit. If everyone who claimed to have gone to Harvard, MIT, etc, had actually gone there they would have an alumni body ten times what it actually is.", "I thought people only acted like you and your dad did in cartoons. YTA, obviously.", "Wow I really had to make an account for this. YTA.", "\n>as we believe he should have been more respectful all things considered\n\nRespect is a 2-way street, not a cul-de-sac terminating at the feet of your and your father's ego. The fact you both were sniggering at the provenance of his degrees says a lot about your moral fabric. Him rubbing his earnings in your face was you and your father getting served your just desserts for being total knobheads. \n\nYTA. Go out and touch grass.", "Obviously YTA. How removed from reality are you?", "YTA- his salary is none of your business. you actually felt insulted hearing how much he makes because maybe it boosted your ego knowing your were better then him. \n\nAnd demanding your sister to defend you makes it even more hilarious . I am actually surprised she didn\u2019t yell at both you and your father.", "YTA Was your elitist viewpoint threatened by his success, despite all of you hoping they failed as punishment for not aborting their child? Why does he have to prove *anything* to you? You don't get to demand something because it threatens your ego. \n\nYour family should be grateful your sister let you have even a glimpse into their lives. I don't know where she got her compassion from, because it certainly didn't come from you and your dad. Maybe she saw it in her mother, who you too were quick to gang up on and decree she's wrong. \n\nI hope your sister cuts you, and your parents, toxic presence from her life. Even now, you still look down your nose to judge her and her husband.  You don't deserve to call her family. You haven't earned it.", "YTA. Why can't you just be happy that your sister and BIL are doing well for themselves after all the hardship theyve been through and pester them about proving his income. All these higher education you and your family received taught you jack about normal human decency.", "YTA. WOW. \nWith a sister like you, it\u2019s amazing your sister even attends family functions. Your inability to find value in anyone who doesn\u2019t fulfill exactly your definition is success is mind blowing. I\u2019d say your parents should be ashamed but it\u2019s obvious where you got this unbelievably snobbish attitude. \n\nHonestly your sister is a saint for putting up with this bizarre judgement you have towards her. Why can\u2019t you just be happy for her?", "Of course YTA, judgemental obnoxious one at that. His salary is none of your goddamn business and she didn't need to tell you AT ALL.\n\nWho are you to ban them from your parents house when youre the one being a judgemental ass.", "YTA. You and your father sure are acting like elitist arrogant snobs.\n\nWhy does your BIL, or anyone for that matter, have to prove their income to you? Are you the IRS?\n\nAt least your mom seems to have seen the error of your ways and decided to not walk your path.", "YTA\n\nIf you work in tech like you claim, then you should know that there is a variety of pathways into the sector and earning potential can vary widely within it. \n\nGet off your high horse and apologise.", "YTA. It sounds like you and your family are still holding onto some deep-seated resentment.", "Jealous and bitter", "Who are you to tell your sister not to go to your parents' house?\n\nYou could've been happy for your sister for not being in a bad financial position anymore. But no, you are annoyed her husband is doing better.\n\nYour dad and you are awful snobby people. The only half decent person at your folks' house tonight is your mother. And not even that much, because she should've told you and your jerk of a father to STFU long ago. The crappy apple rotted too close to the fungus ridden tree. \n\nI'm glad for your sister, something you would also be if you were raised right. \n\nYTA.", "Let me understand this.  your sister was cut off by her family, left to sink or swim on her own with a young child.  she and her husband managed to make it work with no help at all and several years later, not only forgive you all but are trying to build a relationship with you as a family and your response is to belittle htme because they didn't attend a fancy university?\n\nYour jealousy shines through here, because your sister and her partner are successful, are loving parents and seem to be in a loving relationship, and of course make double of what you are so proud of (your high salary).\n\nYour condecesion and bitterness also shine through on this post, you don't even try to name/identify your niece or nephew they are solely 'the child' your sister kept.  You and your father owe your sister and her husband a grovelling apology or you will lose them for good and believe me that will be more your loss than theirs.    \n\n\nIn case you didn't get - YTA", "YTA. I thought such snobby and toxic families existed only in dramas. \nYou and your father cannot comprehend how actual hard work and talent can take people to places. \nSuccess is the best revenge and your BIL and sister's good life is the best answer for your parents cutting her off and basically shaming her when she was young. The couple is probably better of not having people like you in their lives", "YTA. A big one at that.\n\nApparently you\u2018re not as great as you think, otherwise the \u201epapermill dummy\u201c wouldnt be making a lot more money than you, with your precious MIT degree.\n\nAnd he\u2018s right, half the effort, double the reward.\n\nYou are absolutely wrong about _everything_ and should he ashamed of yourself (and your dad).\n\nYOU are the disrespectful person in this scenario, dont get it twisted and you should apologize to your sister and her husband, even though we all know you\u2018re never going to.", "YTA\n\n>I then told her to not come to my parents house until both she and her husband apologized.\n\nWhat exactly do they have to apologize for? *You* were the one being judgemental, condescending, and disrespectful.

The whole post is gross. You think you\u2019re better then anyone that doesn\u2019t graduate from a top college. People become successful taking many different paths. Why do you think you\u2019re better then others? Was it your parents that taught you that? Why would your sister tell you his salary prior? Was she to assume you were going to try to humiliate and put down her husband at the dinner table? I guess she should of known you aren\u2019t the respectful type. Why do you need to prove your better? Are you embarrassed for spending so much more money on your education, to not make as much as you? It\u2019s like you want your sister and her husband to fail because they didn\u2019t take the same path as you and your parents.

Chuckles died really fast when sis sent that screenshot huh?", "Edit: YTA, here\u2019s the reasons.\n1. Marrying young and having a child before you can necessarily fully afford it is not wrong. Maybe irresponsible, but it shows how responsible your sister (and her husband) had to make herself in order to make that work. Y\u2019all act like you can just easily decide to have an abortion like that, which is just.. really unempathetic to say the least. Besides, if her parents had her back instead of estranging themselves because she didn\u2019t bend to their will, it probably wouldn\u2019t have been such a hard time for her.\nAnd beyond that, plenty of people marry young and/or conceive young and still live fulfilling, financially healthy lives. You talk as if she doesn\u2019t have her life together purely because she didn\u2019t live it the way you would, same for her husband. God forbid anyone stray from the golden path.\n2. Online universities are also not wrong. Some of the smartest people I know are also in the military and can\u2019t attend in-person because they\u2019re busy serving. Can\u2019t attend in-person to take care of kids, relatives, disabilities of their own. God forbid someone doesn\u2019t have the money or time for an MIT education. They were probably busy taking care of THEIR CHILD.\n3. Their way of life is pretty similar, if not way more fortunate than most people in America (not sure if that\u2019s where you\u2019re living, but that\u2019s fact).

I'm going to start from the start. My sister and I are our parents (m(62), f(59)) only children. My father went to Harvard, and my mother attended Johns Hopkins and works as a pediatrician. I work in the tech industry, and graduated from MIT with a degree in comp-sci.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile my sister got pregnant at 20 (they got married at 18), and kept the child, despite our parents saying they would pay for the abortion. My parents stopped paying for her education after that, and for lack of better terms, left her to her own devices. She dropped out, and her husband continued, getting his bachelors in comp-sci 1 year later.\r  \n\r  \n8 years removed from this, I work at a top tech company. I live alone and make over 6 figures. My family have all reconciled, and my sister and her husband have moved back for his work. During dinner last night, the conversation shifted to what their life was like while we were estranged, and my sister brought up how tough it was on their own, but they made it work. During this, they brought up her husbands degrees, and my father and I chuckled when she mentioned he'd gotten his masters degree in comp-sci, as he'd gotten it from one of the worst schools, and got his MBA from an online university, so essentially both were papermills.\r  \n\r  \nTalks then went on to how much he was making, where he mentioned he was set to make over 300k. When hearing this, I was in shock and told him to prove it, to which he asked \"why, don't you believe me\", and both my father and I both said no. This clearly insulted him a bit and he said he had nothing to prove. We then went back and forth until he said something about half the cost (regarding his degree cost to mine) and double the reward (in regard to his salary to mine, I'd shared my salary with my sister earlier in the year, guess she'd told him). This caused a bit more disagreement, with my father and mother defending me, until they had to go back home as their baby sitter (f 20) had classes the next day.\r  \n\r  \nOn their way home, my sister sent me a screenshot of his salary, and told me how disappointed she was in myself and our parents for how we'd acted. I then sent her an angry voice message about why she wouldn't tell me about this earlier, and how she should have defended me because anyone would be in shock with all the facts. She then responded saying my parents and I were bitter because he was more successful than us at a younger age. I then told her to not come to my parents house until both she and her husband apologized. I decided to stay at my parents house for the night as I didnt bring a car, and didn't feel safe walking or calling a taxi late at night. As I was sitting with my parents, my mother then says we were all too hard on them, and he had good reason to be a little boastful considering how we'd treated them. My father and I strongly disagree, as we believe he should have been more respectful all things considered. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The children are props.", "She didn\u2019t play by their rules and had the audacity to make her own decisions, so naturally they were insulted because they probably realized that she couldn\u2019t be controlled or live up to their inane standards. Hence, she was cut off.", "The point is that it is supposed to be a choice!", "Don\u2019t you know that 20 is the new 14 and that love evades those younger than 30 years old. \n\nFirst comes ~~love~~ college degrees \n\nThen comes ~~marriage~~ social networking that will lead you to your pretentious counterpart whom you will obviously marry at the proper edge instead of at *shivers* 20 years old!! Only ignorant plebeians do that because they claim to be \u201cin love\u201d, but love doesn\u2019t pay for the inevitable plastic surgery you\u2019ll need or your vaginal rejuvenation that you so desperately seek in the hopes that your husband won\u2019t have an affair with his 20 year old mistress...*again*. After all, you married him for financial superiority not *love*!\n\nThen comes ~~a baby in a baby carriage~~ your ~~family~~ props in the form of family - you have your children whom you\u2019ll transform into tiny obnoxious little humans that you\u2019ve created in your image because you\u2019re that much superior. You dress them up in all the latest styles to prove to others that you have money and you\u2019re better than them. \n\nThen you have your children continue in your footsteps by going to your beloved alma matter and you\u2019ll defend them when people scoff at them because MIT is not an ivy, it\u2019s better! And if your children don\u2019t fall in line and fill up every centimeter of the precious mold you\u2019ve created for them, well, consider them disowned! They\u2019ve thrown away all of your hard work and for what?! *A loving family*! Banish them!\n\nSorry for the long response!! I think I had quite a bit to get off my chest lol.", "same. \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, I completely get why sister sent those screenshots. Sister was probably in a fit of rage to be like ' F U, look at how well did and will be without you!\"", "Lol ok. People don\u2019t come in a wide variety, and they definitely don\u2019t have different writing styles. Everyone must fit into a mold or it isn\u2019t real. Sounds legit!", "Everything is tickling the bullshit sensors... you went to harvard and you don t know that the story makes you seem insuferable?  These posts always make me wonder if it is a real story-ish but the writer is actually  the the \"victim\".  Am i the asshole for being a snob to my underdog brother in law who pulled himself up from his own bootstraps and is now a secret millionaire?", "This happens way too often.

That\u2019s not what I meant at all. It has nothing to do with style, but rather the impulse to portray oneself well. In this case, the author, with their four-hour-old account, gives the lead characters no redeeming qualities at all. \n\nEither way, real or not, OP is a complete AH."]}
