She goes to classes for all of them and classes here are expensive.\n\nMy son recently showed a lot of interest in doing something new especially a musical instrument. He asked if we can sign him up for one or two classes. I talked to my husband about this. He said he will see what we can afford.\n\nA few days after that he told me that he doesn't think we can afford it, That when the baby comes we are gonna have a lot more expenses and it's just not possible right now. I suggested maybe we can stop one or two of my stepdaughters classes? This way both kids can go to 2 classes and it will be more fair. He said he won't do that.\n\nWe got into an argument and I told him he is not treating my son fairly and stepdaughter doesn't need 4 classes. Stopping 2 of them will be fine\n\nHe called me an asshole and said he won't stop his daughters classes because she has been doing all of this since she was a kid and it's more than just a hobby for her.

Wow, that\u2019s a lot of intense careers for one lifetime. I had a friend in high school who was an amazing cello player and a star of the tennis team.

The other two can be practiced at home easily enough and around her main pursuits. The social aspect probably plays a part in it as well and the connections she has made in the groups.

Eventually she is going to have to choose", "She is a child. Your plans needs to account for the possibility of mistakes.", "How old was she when she made that decision? Was there a fund at one point that was used after she decided college wasn't for her?", "Pay it with child support, then.", "But that's up to her, YOU shouldn't have a choice in that.\n\nFair but not equal. Do you not hear yourself?", "I don't know how old she was but my husband says he had some money saved for her but she decided college is not for her and asked my husband to spend it on her classes.
