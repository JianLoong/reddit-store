I don't think I have ever seen her relax, she always has to do something. She plays baseball, bass guitar, does drawing and dancing. Doing all of these activites clearly costs a lot. She goes to classes for all of them and classes here are expensive.\n\nMy son recently showed a lot of interest in doing something new especially a musical instrument. He asked if we can sign him up for one or two classes. I talked to my husband about this. He said he will see what we can afford.\n\nA few days after that he told me that he doesn't think we can afford it, That when the baby comes we are gonna have a lot more expenses and it's just not possible right now. I suggested maybe we can stop one or two of my stepdaughters classes? This way both kids can go to 2 classes and it will be more fair. He said he won't do that.\n\nWe got into an argument and I told him he is not treating my son fairly and stepdaughter doesn't need 4 classes. Stopping 2 of them will be fine\n\nHe called me an asshole and said he won't stop his daughters classes because she has been doing all of this since she was a kid and it's more than just a hobby for her.
