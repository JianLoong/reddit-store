Well nope, she did mind the whole time, he didn't listen. Do now after 35 years of marriage their retirement is hell, because she had stored all that resentment over being an overwhelmed housewife and mother and she's taking it out on jim because he's finally home.

Almost everyone I (loctaed in EU country) know married in the last couple of years and none of them spent more than 10k (\u20ac) and most even just around 5k. I just googled and here average marriage costs seem to be around 13k while this number is a little misleading since it's pushed up by some few extremely exatravagant weddings.

Not advocating for expensive weddings or rings here but a software engineer couldn't spend what he would for a new phone for his wife's wedding ring or twice that amount to their wedding. Eloping and having a nice reception for  $2k or so at a local restaurant or bar is not asking too much from a software engineer.", "Esh.
