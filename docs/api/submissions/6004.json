My cousin came in and interrupted to brag that his wife never had a bachelorette party and would never want one because they\u2019re a waste of money, and she\u2019s so much more practical and less materialistic than most women.\n\nI decided to let him know how his wife really feels since she complains to us all the time about him and his cheap habits. I told him about what actually happened on their wedding day. \n\nHours before the ceremony when my sister and I and our cousins were helping his bride get ready at their house, she went in the backyard and saw their cheap, checkered white and red plastic barbecue tables and burst into tears.

He said \u201cno one cares about weddings and materialistic parties.\u201d He\u2019s like a child with no having no concept of money or taste.\n\nI informed him the average cost of a wedding is $34K.

I know a couple who are always having tension, the husband used to say for decades how the wife \"never minds him working late and never helping her with anything, she's independent and wants to do everything herself\". Well nope, she did mind the whole time, he didn't listen. Do now after 35 years of marriage their retirement is hell, because she had stored all that resentment over being an overwhelmed housewife and mother and she's taking it out on jim because he's finally home.

Almost everyone I (loctaed in EU country) know married in the last couple of years and none of them spent more than 10k (\u20ac) and most even just around 5k. I just googled and here average marriage costs seem to be around 13k while this number is a little misleading since it's pushed up by some few extremely exatravagant weddings.
