Her and her fianc\u00e9 are going all out no expenses spared just like she always said she would. It\u2019s going to be an extravagant affair with hundreds of guests, and she\u2019s thrilled planning it. \n\nOur anti-social cousin (31M) makes pretty good money as a software engineer, but he has no social awareness and is extremely cheap. He would literally sleep on a dirty mattress on the floor with nothing in his house but a TV and console if his wife let him. That\u2019s what he was doing before they met. He thinks dressing presentably and having a decent home is \u201cmaterialistic.\u201d\n\nNow, my sister and I happily identify as materialistic, but he means it negatively when he says it.\n\nSince my sister started planning her wedding and gushing about it to me and some other people (not him), he always butts in with some smarmy remark about how weddings are stupid, what kind of stupid woman would spend tens of thousands on a wedding, and \u201cbrags\u201d about how he married his wife last year in their backyard and her ring was $200 from a strip mall and she was \u201cecstatic.\u201d\n\nToday, my sister was gushing to me and my mom and some female cousins about her bachelorette party. My cousin came in and interrupted to brag that his wife never had a bachelorette party and would never want one because they\u2019re a waste of money, and she\u2019s so much more practical and less materialistic than most women.\n\nI decided to let him know how his wife really feels since she complains to us all the time about him and his cheap habits. I told him about what actually happened on their wedding day. \n\nHours before the ceremony when my sister and I and our cousins were helping his bride get ready at their house, she went in the backyard and saw their cheap, checkered white and red plastic barbecue tables and burst into tears. She was sobbing about how deeply ashamed she felt that her family and friends from college were going to see their cheapskate $700 wedding, and see her walk through her own backyard in a $90 \u201cdollar store dress like a middle schooler at prom.\u201d She said she thought her wedding would be special, and if she knew it would be this way, she would\u2019ve eloped rather than feel humiliated in front of everyone she knew. They had to redo her make after her crying.\n\nSo she\u2019s just as \u201cmaterialistic\u201d as normal people are. Why does he think she told people not to take pictures on their wedding day.\n\nHe was livid, ranting that he spent $700 giving her a nice wedding and he\u2019s not going to waste his money on something so stupid, so how dare I say that about his now wife. He said \u201cno one cares about weddings and materialistic parties.\u201d He\u2019s like a child with no having no concept of money or taste.\n\nI informed him the average cost of a wedding is $34K. He humiliated his wife, and their wedding was the type catty people will gossip about for years. He was so mad he drove home through the snow.", "created_utc": 1672407007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz0kjr/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_how_his_wife_really/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister's wedding isn't his business.\n\n\nUnpopular opinion, but his wife sucks for lying to him and not communicating.  Did she not know what the tablecloths were going to look like? Did they bit have any grown up conversations about finances in the relationship? Also, all the talk of him giving her the wedding....is he the sole earner? \n\n\nYou suck for telling him how his wife feels....that's her place, not yours.", "ESH\u2026\n\nYour cousin should realize you can spend less than 34k but more the $700 and have a decent wedding. Your cousin also should have asked what she wanted. \n\nYour Cousin in Law (the wife) should have said something. She should have done some research on how they could spend more but not go all out. If that\u2019s what she wanted. \n\nYou also didn\u2019t handle it well either. I get it he was frustrating but you potentially put a rift in their marriage for what? To shut him up? \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m sure it was coming for their marriage since it sounds like they don\u2019t communicate well but either way.", "ESH - You threw your cousin's wife under the bus just to twist the knife and punish your cousin, and you're the kind of catty person who is still gossiping about his wedding later. Your cousin needs to but out and quit griping about business that isn't his. You both sound awful.", "Esh. Your cousin is definitely an Ah, but did you get his wife\u2019s permission to share her feelings? Or did you just send him home to pick a fight with her?", "ESH - Your cousin naturally for continuing to emphasize how his way is the right way. But you as well because you did not get permission from his wife to share her feelings regarding her own wedding to him. \n\nAside from that, there are plenty of weddings that are nice that cost far less than 34k (and more than 700 but if both parties agree on doing something really small and low cost it wouldn't matter either).", "ESH. He was being obnoxious, you shouldn't have said that, and his wife never should have married someone with wildly different values and then complained behind his back.", "ESH. Your cousin sucks because your sister's wedding is none of his business and he needs to keep his unwanted opinions to himself. At the same time you suck because that poor woman was venting to you and you completely betrayed her trust. Was his wife there during this shitshow? If not, what do you think your cousin did when he got home after driving through the snow, mad as hell? Do you think he gave her a kiss and asked her how her day was? I hope you at least had the decency to call and give her a heads-up about what you'd done rather than let her be completely blindsided.", "ESH he's being a dick and you're revealing private info that the wife in question didn't want to mention to him but vented to you in private and you never got the okay to mention and thereby causing drama for her.", "I honestly don\u2019t believe it. The bride was that surprised and upset on her wedding day, for a cheap wedding which she had 0 input on? She accepted a $200 ring and expected what kind of wedding?\n\nYour cousin is an AH but you sound insufferable. And *if* this story is true, you betrayed someone just to make some kind of \u2018gotcha!\u2019 zinger, which completely is disgusting. \n\nAlso, being so materialistic *isn\u2019t* a good look, but to each her own. \n\nESH.", "So torn, but ESH. He definitely deserves some pushback and a dose of reality given how judgmental and self-important his is, but given how self-obsessed and oblivious this guy is, I feel it was really unwise to tell him how his wife actually responded. At *best*,she\u2019s gonna be bombarded with a bunch of \u201cyou didn\u2019t actually feel that way!\u201d assertions or questions from him now. (That said, she married this guy, and they may need to work this out\u2026 but presumably she has her reasons.)", "ESH. It wasn't your place to tell him how his wife felt.  It was hers to discuss with her husband.   He's an ass for thinking everyone wants to hear his opinions all the time about how people spend money.  And...did you just call yourself catty?", "ESH You can have a nice wedding for less than $34k and wasn't your place to tell him how his wife felt. He sucks, well for all the reasons.", "ESH - not your place and there's nothing wrong with having a cheap wedding if that's what the bridal couple want. In your cousin's case though that doesn't seem to be the case, but why hasn't cousin's wife told him? They sound pretty incompatible.", "ESH , but you are a huge AH. \nYou threw his wife under the bus! If you\u2019d only expressed your own thoughts and opinions, you would not be the AH. You betrayed her confidence and exploited one of her darkest moments for a snappy retort.", "ESH it is not his place to to criticize your sister's choices, and it is not your place to tell him what his now wife felt. She should have expressed herself to him.\nPeople have different priorities and that's ok. It is ok to have a small simple wedding if you choose, and it is ok to have an extravagant wedding if you choose. It needs to be agreed upon by both partners, and others should respect their choice.", "ESH. Cousin for obvious reasons, but so are you. Plenty of people have tasteful weddings that don\u2019t cost $34K. It wasn\u2019t your place to tell him how his wife felt.", "ESH. It was absolutely not your place to talk about something \"his bride\" said to you in confidence. That was up to her to speak about. You have just purposefully added drama to someone else's relationship, just to win a very pointless argument.", "NTA if he hadn't been constantly bringing up the comparison and trying to make others feel bad for something they're excited about then this wouldn't have happened. I feel sorry for his wife that his cheapness ruined her first wedding experience", "This sounds like there's serious lack of communication between them. Don't people discuss the details of their weddings? If not details, they definitely discuss budget and expectations. Damn. \n\nTbh it wasn't your place but it's not your fault either.", "ESH - he consistently is critical of others choices openly, so he got what he deserved.  You are an AH for betraying his wife\u2019s trust and sending him home to scream at her.  You are also an AH because your bragging about being materialistic is insufferable.  \u201chappily identify as materialistic\u201d isn\u2019t something to be proud of.   You basically say you prefer form over substance and you come off as vapid and shallow.  Everyone in your story is an AH.", "Going to go with NTA. If he wasn\u2019t constantly insulting \u201cmaterialistic women\u201d, then I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t have mentioned anything. He shouldn\u2019t dish it out if he can\u2019t take it.", "ESH good lawd", "ESH\n\nMy god, you all sound insufferable! \n\nIt takes a whole variety of people to make a world, but while you and your cousin may have different opinions, you\u2019re still the exact same kind of judgy opinionated and self righteous AHs as each other!", "NTA, but your cousin is right.  34000 for a wedding is ridiculous", "NTA. He brought this on himself. None of this would\u2019ve happened if he kept his comments to himself on someone else\u2019s wedding day.", "NTA, I'm just afraid you've brought hell upon his poor wife...\nAnd they need to do something quick before the resentment really sets in. I know a couple who are always having tension, the husband used to say for decades how the wife \"never minds him working late and never helping her with anything, she's independent and wants to do everything herself\". Well nope, she did mind the whole time, he didn't listen. Do now after 35 years of marriage their retirement is hell, because she had stored all that resentment over being an overwhelmed housewife and mother and she's taking it out on jim because he's finally home. Absolute nightmare fuel", ">I informed him the average cost of a wedding is $34K.\n\nHoly shit, what exactly do you folks do over there? Almost everyone I (loctaed in EU country) know married in the last couple of years and none of them spent more than 10k (\u20ac) and most even just around 5k. I just googled and here average marriage costs seem to be around 13k while this number is a little misleading since it's pushed up by some few extremely exatravagant weddings. Quantity wise most people actually spend between 5 - 10k.\n\nAnyway, that's not the point here, your cousin sounds like a horrible obnoxious person, NTA someone needs to give him a wake up call.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
