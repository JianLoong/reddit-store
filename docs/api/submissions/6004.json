My cousin came in and interrupted to brag that his wife never had a bachelorette party and would never want one because they\u2019re a waste of money, and she\u2019s so much more practical and less materialistic than most women.\n\nI decided to let him know how his wife really feels since she complains to us all the time about him and his cheap habits. I told him about what actually happened on their wedding day. \n\nHours before the ceremony when my sister and I and our cousins were helping his bride get ready at their house, she went in the backyard and saw their cheap, checkered white and red plastic barbecue tables and burst into tears.

Why does he think she told people not to take pictures on their wedding day.\n\nHe was livid, ranting that he spent $700 giving her a nice wedding and he\u2019s not going to waste his money on something so stupid, so how dare I say that about his now wife. He said \u201cno one cares about weddings and materialistic parties.\u201d He\u2019s like a child with no having no concept of money or taste.\n\nI informed him the average cost of a wedding is $34K. He humiliated his wife, and their wedding was the type catty people will gossip about for years.

Well nope, she did mind the whole time, he didn't listen.

Not advocating for expensive weddings or rings here but a software engineer couldn't spend what he would for a new phone for his wife's wedding ring or twice that amount to their wedding.

How would you feel if you found out your hypothetical husband was actually really upset over the cost of your own hypothetical wedding through a cousin you don't get along with?\n\nI would say the key AH is actually your unhappy cousin-inlaw who married this man to begin with. This attitude and lifestyle didn't start with their relationship, and won't end with their relationship. He was like this seemingly for a long time before they got together. She knew where he stood.

She didn't know the wedding was going to be like this, but she expected an extremely anti-materialistic man to pull out all the big and ostentatious displays for her that day without any prior communication on the matter? Quite frankly, it wasn't only her wedding, it was his too. And if only one person here was taking care of all the planning and financial contribution, then it was his call to make and she shouldn't have left it up to chance with unvoiced expectations and wishes.\n\n>Why does he think she told people not to take pictures on their wedding day.\n\nSo again, you're blaming this guy - as abrasive as he may be - for his wife's seemingly complete inability to communicate her wants, needs, and what she's upset over. \"Oh he should just be able to figure it out,\" y'all need to stop expecting somebody to be everything opposite of what they are. You both have a clear understanding of what kind of a person he is, so stop punishing him for the fact that you can't accept him as is. She needs to stop silently festering wishing for him to change into somebody he's not so she can get her fantasized relationship instead of working on her real live relationship. I may not like this guy's character as you described him, I likely wouldn't go out of my way to befriend him, but I also find it far worse to sit around boiling in your own resentment over somebody being exactly who they are than having an abrasive personality.\n\nYou and his wife definitely share that quality and I find it just as abrasive as the personality you described from him. What exactly was stopping you from directly telling him when he was behaving like that: *\"Nobody here asked for your input and we don't find it appropriate for you to assert some baseless sense of superiority over a difference in lifestyle and preferences. You're entitled to feel and believe however you want here, but there is a time and place to share this and when you do share it you have to do so with basic respect to everyone else participating in the conversation. I would appreciate it if going forward from here you can exercise some basic respect over our differences in priority if you wish to speak on them further. You certainly wouldn't like it if I treated your lifestyle choices with the same disrespect you put on us, so let's not go down such an immature path and instead try to be decent adults to one another.\"* He most likely wouldn't have calmed down and behaved maturely going forwards, and you would have been able to hold your head up high and assert that you are far better than he is for never stooping to his level and even lower. Instead of finding any reasonable way to tell him to stop and keep these things to himself, you festered until you felt an outburst that has potentially caused a serious rift in his relationship was the appropriate thing to do. That doesn't make you any better than him in this situation.", "ESH. He is an idiot for his behavior, but so are you. Also where did you hear an average wedding costs that much?

When i sit back and think of not only how long that would take me to save up, but more importantly, the othe bigger life necessities this could cover, particularly if there's an unexpected job loss or house repair or medical bill, it makes it hard to justify  spending that kind of money on a wedding.\n\nOf course, how other people spend their money, and what they reasonably can afford, is none of my business,  and i don't judge them, especially if they aren't going into debt over it.
