{"id": 26144, "submission_id": "1692mc6", "title": "AITA for insisting that my mother called my son a thief", "selftext": "Last year in August, me and my oldest son stayed at my mother's house for a few weeks while we were moving between countries.\n\nOn the last day, mom drove us to the train station. We got there early, and me and my son went to chill on the platform and talk.\n\nHalf an hour later, mom showed up out of breath and quite visibly upset. She couldn't find one of her laptops, and she repeatedly asked us both, but particularly my son, if we had maybe taken it \"accidentally\" or as a \"joke.\"\n\nWe both assured her that we hadn't taken it. I also promised her that if somehow we had, that I would ship it back to her immediately.\n\nMy son is a teenager, and occasionally behaves poorly, but he's never been a thief and has always been open and honest. The whole visit, my mother had been giving him side-eye, and making comments to me in private about how he's like his mother. Mom never liked my ex wife. My son had a very difficult time living with his mother and I think he's worked hard to be an open, honest person who does a good job dealing with feelings directly.\n\nA few hours later, sure enough, while we were on the train, mom wrote me saying she had found the laptop.\n\nI told her then, and I've since had occasion to repeat to her, that what she did was very damaging, especially to him. And that she was calling him a thief .\n\nShe tells me that I'm the only person who spoke of theft, she certainly didn't. But I don't understand how someone accidentally packs a laptop (my son's MacBook looks nothing like her more full size laptops). I think since nobody would actually do this by accident, that she's being using weasel words to avoid admitting what she said.\n\nShe hasn't really apologised. Me and my son are still salty about it. It's interfering with our relationship.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693761658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1692mc6/aita_for_insisting_that_my_mother_called_my_son_a/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She didnt SAY he was a thief but were all adults, we know the implication. Honestly a hill id die on. She didnt liek your ex, okay but her grandchild isnt your ex. Shes transferring that animosity, and thats not okay.\nAs a side note, does ex and son share a strong resemblance?", "NTA. This is a lovely hill to die on. It has a nice breeze and a lovely view. Stand up for your son as he is the one that is owed the apology.", "NTA\nShe chased you down at the train station and wouldn't take \"no\" for an answer. Actions speak louder than words.\n\nWould she claim she did all that, not to imply her laptop was leaving on the train with you and your son, but just to talk about how upset she was for misplacing it herself?\n\nShe was after her laptop, sure your son stole it. No other reason for her to act the way she did. I wouldn't ask your son to stay with her again unless she made a sincere apology to each of you.", "NTA - Your mother strongly implied, she didn't have to actually say the word, her actions and speech came through loud and clear.  Consider going NC with her to spare you and your child more drama.  Its just not worth it.", "NTA. Perfect opportunity to freeze out your mother, keeping your boy safe to her unfair prejudice and thus teaching her she should manage her feelings in more mature way, and showing your kid that you got his back and that it's not okay to be disrespected like that. I think you handled things at the train station in a very calm and diffusive way.", "NTA. Your mom was out of line and she owes both of you an apology.  Please talk to your son and hopefully he will come to see that you took his side immediately and have not waivered.  Poor kid prolly thinks \"everyone\" thinks he's a thief. Being a teenager is hard.\n\nI LOVE your \"weasel words\" phrase. I am going to borrow it! And if she does come around with something like \"I'm sorry that you felt like was accusing you...\" that is BS - more weasel words. She needs to apologize in such a way that she takes responsibility for what she said.", ">I also promised her that if somehow we had, that I would ship it back to her immediately.\n\nINFO: Sounds with that statement like you confirmed that it was a possibility your son did take it. I agree your Mom was hinting at the same thing. Why wasn't it a flat \"we don't have it\" once your son said no?\n\nSo is there some reason or history here that would make both of you think that?", "YTA. She specifically did NOT call anyone a thief. Said accidently or as a prank to AVOID calling either one of you a thief.", "Yes. Your story doesn't mention her calling him a thief.", "NTA.\n\nSit down with your son and have a convo, see what he wants to do.  Your mother may have thought she was being low key the week you stayed but I'm wiling to bet limbs that he noticed something was up if not outright understood.\n\nIf he decides he'd like to go LC/NC with her and you agree, than so be it.  But DO talk with him about the incident, reassure him that he is not at fault.", "The apology is the key thing and it doesn't sound like she gave one.\n\n\"Mom, regardless of whether you used the word 'thief', you made an accusation, that accusation was unwarranted and you need to apologize. 'Grandson, I am sorry I jumped to that conclusion, it was wrong and I apologize'\".\n\nThis is the minimum your son is owed. If she can't say something like that, you really need to go LC/NC - and for certain, no longer subject your son to her, because she is not a positive in his life.", "Agreed but also I think you meant insinuated.", "I think my son looks a lot like me. He definitely does have me exes nose though, and he's got a thinner build like her. He's mixed race, and his hair, skin tone and eye colour all resemble his mother.", "And no, there's no history or reason I can think of for her to worry about this.", "I said that just to make her leave. I found the whole interaction embarrassing and difficult. I knew we absolutely did not have her laptop.", "She kept hounding them about it even after both saying no. She obviously believed her grandson had it", "She implied very hard though.", "I think I was clear she didn't use the word. But \"accidentally\" or as a \"joke\" taking a laptop strains credulity, that's why I think she effectively did.", "Don't understand how implying something works, do you?", "I was going to ask race of all parties involved but i didnt want to put that out there buuuutttt you say it and it jumps to my intial thought. Think you need to put a relation with gamgam on ice cause thats even MORE not ok.", "Ah it\u2019s yet another r/tldrtheyreracist case", "Thinking back on it, she wasn't leaving, and I had the impression she expected us to unpack to show this.\n\nWe were on a train platform and I knew we didn't have it. I absolutely was not going to go through our substantial luggage for this. I said I would send it to avoid the scene continuing and going through five large bags with her huffing and puffing.", "I think your just a drama queen who likes to overreact.", "I know how inferring works.", "So do you understand how saying \"hey, my laptop is missing, did your son take it?\" would mean theft or are you intentionally obtuse?", "Do you not understand how inferring works?", "Yes, I understand it just fine. The grandmother did not infer anything.  She implied theft.  She had no evidence of her missing laptop and therefore couldn't infer shit and could only speculate.\n\nI'm sorry you don't understand the things you claim to understand.", "The op inferred.", "The op inferred that the grandmother was implying theft.  Yes.  Op is also correct in that."]}
