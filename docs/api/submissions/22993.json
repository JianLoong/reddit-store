I never get why people don't undertstand Service Dogs aren't your average everyday Fido and literally help save lives or just assist their owners in living a life most of us take for granted.\n\nPeople are weird...", "NTA \n\nYou should have dared her to call animal control.", "NTA\n\nSome people just should not be allowed to have kids. I absolutely despise these kinds of mothers. Your kid does not walk on water and shit rainbows. The world does not revolve around them and nor should it.", "NTA. I don't care if your dog was a service dog or not, no one is entitled to pet your dog if you don't want them to. Just because A kid loves dogs does not mean that he has the right to go and pet every dog he sees, and the sooner he learns that, the better his life will be.\n\nI not only feel sorry for the kid, who is going to grow up to be a miserable adult, but for the father, who has to try to keep that entire entitled family under control.\n\nAs far as you - you did absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA. You told her MORE than once. I'm shocked she actually asked based on her entitlement. I'm on a list right now for my SD; I've heard so many stories like this that it's unbelievable. \n\nI'm so sorry. You are never in the wrong in this situation. Just like my wheelchair is an extension of my body, Rex is an extension of you. \n\nI'm so sorry. Be well.", "NTA \n\nA service dog is not the same as a pet. And even if your dog was strictly a pet, that doesn\u2019t mean strangers are entitled to pet him. Your dog has a job, and it\u2019s not to mitigate the tantrums of strangers children. That would be the parents job. You\u2019ll never be the asshole for not agreeing to enable a strangers lazy parenting at your own expense/risk.", "NTA- sorry you went through that and not sure what your options are but calling the police on her for harassment might be all you can do. I don\u2019t imagine that would be good for the PTSD.\n\nMaybe you should find a different pharmacy at a smaller store, less prone to entitled trash.", "NTA - These entitled morons raising entitled spawn need to hec right off. A service dog is not for the amusement of the public, period.", "Wow. I am forever amazed when I read stories like that. I must live a blessed life as I can't recall ever meeting anyone so  tone deaf ever. NTA 1000x NTA.", "NTA. Period. End if discussion.", "NTA. That poor dad.", "NTA at all. If this dialogue is accurate you did the right thing, well done for standing your ground.", "Didn\u2019t have to read NTA.", "Animal control would have taken her. NTA.", "Clearly NTA\n\nI can't even immage having things like PTSD, but i do know it's BAD. The EK learned his leson to not get everything he wants... And the mom? Well screw that waste of oxygen. You should be proud of yourself, you did a great job", "See, you should have let her call them. \n\nWhere I live people can be fined for: \n\n* Falsely claiming to be a disabled person to get protection under the act\t\r  \n\n* Refusing to return a service dog identification card when asked to do so\t\r  \n\n* Discriminating against a person lawfully using a qualified service dog or refusing access to qualified service dog teams\n\nThe fines can be anywhere from $300 to $3000\n\nSo NTA", "NTA, she was determined to intimidate you into getting her way.  Personally I would have told her to call animal control and let animal control explain to her why she was a complete fool for not know services dogs are allowed everywhere and that they should not be disturbed when they are working.", "NTA - I'm sorry you went through that. I feel bad for the dad considering he has two two-year-olds to contend with. Wtf part of no does she not understand? She's raising a child just like her - deplorable.", "NTA. A service dog is an extension of you. It was working, all kids need to learn not to touch service animals.", "WOW I'm so sorry. Obvs know the judgement, nta", "NTA", "I;m sooo very sorry that you and your dog were exposed to this.  Please, try to stay strong!", "Nta. 6 is more than old enough to learn to leave a working dog alone.", "NTA. No explanation needed, really, except - not kid's dog, not kid's choice.", "nta!! nobody and i mean NOBODY is entitled to your service dog, people need to be taught manners", "NTA. Even if she calls Jesus himself, she will still get the same answer. Service animals cannot be distracted when working.", "NTA, and if this ever happens again, where someone refuses to take no for a first answer, alert the nearest employee. Depending on where you live, interfering with a service animal may be a criminal offense, and most employees will step in and make the person leave.", "NTA. Your dog.", "NTA. \n\nFirst off I'm sorry about this. It must take everything in you just to go outside. You go to the store and run into a woman whose stupidity and entitlement is so incredible that she defies logic. You then had to sit for a long period of time with your doggo, just to calm down. I hope that woman gets permanent laryngitis so she can never bother anyone ever again.\n\nI've never met one of these people. I really want to because I'm all about wake up calls.", "NTA. No dog should be touched unless their person gives permission. This is for the safety of the dog and the handsy two-legged mouth breathers. This goes quadruple for service dogs. And this is common knowledge. EM was so out of line. She\u2019s a bad mom raising a future entitled nightmare. KD should have told her to knock it off and wrangled the kid the first time you interacted\u2014-not after three attempts.", "NTA. Next time try saying \u201cSorry, he has history of biting kids\u201d", "NTA.\nFirst of all, hope you are taking good care and feeling better.\nI am really furious right know, there is someone's health and maybe life on that case and you still insist making everything worse just to make your son who you can't take care of shut up. Bad parenting and selfishness. \nMoreover, even if your dog isn't a service dog, you don't have to let somone pet it.", "You should have ushered her to call the police, you could have sued her majorly depending on the state youre in. She was quite literally harassing you and your service animal. If your service animal is legally documented and licensed then you shouldnt have problems with any legal issues like the police or animal control. That mom is definitely the AH and i feel bad for her husband. Assuming shes a stay at home the kid definitely got the manners from her", "ESH except the kid, dad & dog. A child is not an it.\n\n6 year olds are still learning to regulate their emotions, mum should\u2019ve have actually parented him but it\u2019s not their fault. They may have no concept of your disability or the dog being untouchable at that stage of development, not to mention possibly having their own additional needs.\n\nMum is obviously an AH but your post reads like some child hating bait, if even real, so YTA too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mostly I get muttered comments as they turn away or dirty looks.  But even those are rare.  I\u2019m pretty good at making people feel guilty or foolish if they are pushy.   When someone addresses the dog before me, I say \u201cignore\u201d which is the dog\u2019s refocus command.  It makes the person apologize, thinking the dog is in trouble. But since I say it before the dog has a chance to be distracted, and he looks at me, he gets a reward, it\u2019s a positive command to him, \u201clook at mom, get treat\u201d.  Easiest command he knows! The clueless member of the public feels guilty for potentially distracting a working dog, which counts as education, and I had to do nothing except give my dog an ordinary command.
