{"id": 7666, "submission_id": "10fe39e", "title": "AITA for telling my friend that I have a crush on her boyfriend?", "selftext": "So my good friend and I are usually very close. We are both in our late 20s now but we've known each other since high school. In all those years, our friendship has never been that rocky, until recently.\n\nMy friend and her boyfriend met about 6 months ago. I'm currently in grad school and have chosen to remain single. Before they met, my friend and I would hang out at her place when I was done with classes because she lives close by. But about 4 months ago, the dynamic started to shift to a trio when her boyfriend started to consistently hang out with us. My friend had shown me pictures of him and I always thought he was attractive, but the crush started developing when I met him in person.\n\nI won't go into too much detail, but my friend's boyfriend, who I would consider to be a friend now, is honestly so fun to be around and I always looked forward to hanging out with him after class. Aside from looks (and he's probably the most beautiful man I've ever seen in person) he's really knowledgable and is a great conversationalist, he's a good story-teller and has a good sense of humor. He's super kind and always checks in with me, and seems to know the right words to say to make me feel appreciated. It sounds tropey, but I honestly can't detect anything wrong with him. Which is even more infuriating for me because I actually don't want to have this crush or think about him in a romantic way.\n\nLast week, he went to visit family so hasn't been around. Last Friday, my friend wanted to know what I thought about him, because they were thinking of moving in together. I basically gave her a rundown similar to the last paragraph, and this prompted her to say it sounded like I had a crush on him. She said it in a joking way, so I sort of just laughed it off. But then I just sort of blurted out that I honestly think I do have a crush on him. It got super awkward when I said that and I immediately felt like I screwed up. I tried to downplay it by saying that it was probably just hormones and me being single and basically tried to play it off as a joke.\n\nFast forward to Monday (when her boyfriend came home), my friend sent me this text. It's verbatim: \"Hey \\[my name\\], going forward I think I need to set some boundaries because I don't want \\[his name\\] to become an issue with us. I think from now on we should just hang out on the weekends just the two of us if that's okay. It would make me feel better. Call me and we can talk about it more. Love you lots\"\n\nMy usual routine on Mondays was to go hang out with her after my lecture so I felt kind of blindsided by this. I have not reached out to her since her text. I'm a bit angry with her because I feel like she's implying that she can't trust me around him, and now she's depriving me of a genuine friendship that has grown between me and him. But I also want to know if this is something that is entirely my fault.

You put your feelings first and you\u2019re continuing to do so by acting like she\u2019s now taking something from you. You put her in a shit situation. I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s keeping you as a friend at this point.", "YTA. Time to apologize for crossing a line and assure her you would never act on it, up down and sideways, and mean it.\n\nAlso, don't push back on her request to limit contact with him for a while. It's totally understandable that she's not comfortable with that under the circumstances.", "What did you think would happen? Not everything needs to be shared, and it's definitely not appropriate to tell your friend you have a crush on their partner. You can't be this obtuse. Of course YTA here.", "YTA - in my opinion, you disrespected your friendship AND her relationship by being so casual about your feelings which, purely based on how you've written about them, seem to cross a line. whether or not you (or he) genuinely think these feelings can evolve into something more, it's insensitive not to think about your friend.\n\nfor the record, the fact that she responded as well as she has and is trying to maintain both her relationship with you and her relationship with him means she's both a good friend and partner. it's unfair for you to be angry at her for protecting TWO relationships that are important to her.", "YTA. \n\n>  now she's depriving me of a genuine friendship that has grown between me and him\n\nHow ? If your entire friendship ends when you stop hanging out with his girlfriend during the week, I don't see how you are that close. It kinda sounds to me more like he was being nice to his girlfriend's best friend and you are misinterpreting it as more meaningful than it is. \n\nNow she wants to draw some boundaries to squash this situation that makes her uncomfortable and your response... is to be angry at her for taking away access to him. And you're surprised she doesn't trust you around him ? You're just digging yourself into a hole. Quit while you're ahead.", "YTA, not for having caught a crush but for being irritated she's closing down your relationship with him. She was about as gracious and kind as can be. Now you need to decide- do you want her friendship or not? This crush isn't going anywhere so are you willing to mourn it in private?", "I'm sorry, what did you expect? That she would be totally cool about you drooling over her partner? Gurl... It's a no-go, which has ruined many relationships (both romantic and platonic ones). Honestly, her setting that boundary seems very mature, appropriate AND respectful of your friendship. Step back, reign yourself in and sort out your feelings before all three of you meet up on the regular again. **YTA**", "YTA, you're infatuated with him. You're in your late 20s, you should know better to control your attractions. Almost all \"crushes\" fade with time. Your friend is incredibly mature and gracious with how she set up healthy boundaries.", "YTA. Guess who was blindsided? Hint: it wasn't you. And yes, this is entirely your fault. \n\nTry to salvage your friendship with your longtime friend, and don't make it about you or your friendship with her boyfriend.", "Honestly, YTA. What did you expect? You did make things awkward and now she feels uncomfortable. I think she handled it very maturely and isn't ending the friendship, just changing your relationship so she doesn't feel weird around you or always wondering what your thinking when he's over.", "YTA the moment you thought you had a crush you should of distanced yourself. That's your friends boyfriend !!!!", ">now she's depriving me of a genuine friendship that has grown between me and him.\n\nIt could have been a N A H situation, but this line pushes it to YTA.\n\nWe can't help who we like, but if you have a crush on your friends bf, you step back if you value your friendship.\n\nShe wasn't rude about it. She set healthy boundaries.\n\nEdit: added a word", "YTA, there isn\u2019t really a reason you needed to tell her you had a crush on him. That\u2019s something you need to deal with internally or in therapy tbh. \n\nHonestly if you found yourself crushing on him to the point where you were to cross boundaries or it was affecting your ability to crush on other people, the right thing to do would be to take the initiative to distance yourself from him for the sake of your friendship with your friend (and for your own sake).", "I think, because of your reaction to her very reasonable text, YTA. If you felt disappointed by her response but just wanted to know if it was a mistake to admit your crush, I would have voted differently. But anger and being blindsided? I'm not really sure WHY you didn't expect this response to you telling her that you like her boyfriend.\n\nIt was fine for you to tell her because now she knows, but you can't be angry at her response because the dynamic between you three has changed. Did you expect her to be fine with you continuing to hang out with her boyfriend and knowing you have a crush on him? I can't blame her for feeling weird. And, plus side, she STILL wants to be your friend so that's a good thing. She just doesn't want any issues happening because of a stupid boy so just do what she's doing and make SURE this guy isn't going to come between the two of you.", ">I also want to know if this is something that is entirely my fault.\n\nWell, first of all, yes. It\u2019s very much your fault and I\u2019m a bit baffled that you don\u2019t understand that. Like\u2026 really? Is common sense something that you normally struggle with? In case the answer to that is \u201cyes,\u201d here\u2019s a basic explanation: announcing to your \u201cbest friend\u201d that you have a crush on her boyfriend \u2014 her boyfriend that she plans on moving in together with \u2014 is brazenly disrespectful to their relationship. I\u2019m really not sure what reaction you were expecting but I don\u2019t know many people who\u2019d respond to your confession with, \u201coh ok, cool, well, feel free to continue ogling my significant other in front of me.\u201d Honestly, the fact that you continued to spend loads of time with him after you developed feelings instead of distancing yourself from him is super sus \u2014 it\u2019s not how good people or friends behave. \n\n>now she's depriving me of a genuine friendship that has grown between me and him\n\nLol, no, she\u2019s not. I\u2019d bet $10 that this was not a unilateral decision based on the timing of when you got that text, and instead what happened is they had a conversation about what you said after he got home. I\u2019d bet an additional $5 that his reaction was somewhere between \u201cwtf\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s kind of weird, isn\u2019t she supposed to be your friend?\u201d In any event, if he wanted to continue a friendship with you, he could \u2014 but he\u2019s choosing his girlfriend over you. You chose maintaining your crush over respecting your friend, and now you need to accept the consequences of that, which is that your friend doesn\u2019t trust you anymore. YTA.", "YTA. I agree with NAH because at least you were upfront and honest, but it seems you knew how you felt about him prior to your convo with your bff and you should have distanced yourself from him on your own accord. \n\nYour friend has been (in my opinion) incredibly graceful over the whole situation. You\u2019re lucky you get to keep your best friend through this ordeal. \n\nYou are a huge asshole for being offended at her and not texting her back for putting some distance between you and her bf (who you called the most attractive person you\u2019ve ever seen). No offence, but she should. You not wanting to text her back or see her now that it\u2019s just the two of you and no bf is suggesting to me that you enjoyed hanging out with her because he was there, too.

But then I just sort of blurted out that I honestly think I do have a crush on him. It got super awkward when I said that and I immediately felt like I screwed up.\n\nShe likely was NOT joking and was sussing you out to see if you did have feelings for him. \n\nYou were under no obligation to tell the truth in this situation.  You are not owed a friendship with this person, thus you are not being \"deprived\" of anything.  He is NOT your boyfriend.  You are not entitled to anything from him.

She's going to tell her bf so you probably lost him as a friend too because of the awkwardness. If you want to be friends with her listen and do as she asks. If not you'll lose both of them.

You\u2019re supposed to be her best friend and have spent most of your post saying how lovely he is, and how he\u2019s the most beautiful man you\u2019ve seen. If you got a chance, I guarantee you\u2019ll take it. Your friend is trying to salvage both relationships. You\u2019re totally in the wrong here.", "YTA your friend was setting good boundaries.", "YTA - She's right, she is being smart here.", "YTA\n\nYou admitted to having feeling for her boyfriend, the person she is getting serious with. Frankly I wouldn't trust you around my partner either, you are detrimental to her relationship and she's not depriving you of anything.", "YTA.

Your reaction to the very reasonable boundaries she's trying to set on the other hand...YTA for that.  \n\nYou put your friend in a ridiculously hard spot and I'm honestly impressed by how well she handled it.  If you really value her as a friend, you need to respect the boundaries she's setting.  She's obviously very serious about this guy if they're considering moving in with each other.", "YTA sit down and be so serious with yourself right now. You really can\u2019t see why what you said was an issue with her? Your lack of self-awareness is alarming, I gotta be honest.", "YTA---Not for the crush but for your response to her text.  She was put in a tough spot and showed that she valued your friendship enough to try to make it work while respecting her relationship.  Your only thought was losing contact with him.  She clearly cares more about you than you do her.  \n\n\nAlso, I will add.  Sounds like he was being nice to you for her sake.  Pretty sure, those days are over at this point.", "I was going to go N A H, but other comments have swayed me to YTA.  She\u2019s being kind- she still wants to be your friend, but she doesn\u2019t want you to have this struggle.  It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t trust you\u2026 she\u2019s just helping you get the distance you need to end the crush, because it won\u2019t go away if you keep hanging out with him.", "Soft YTA for getting angry at her reasonable requests. Is bad luck that the one dude you get a crush on is taken, even mor so by your best friend but that\u2019s one thing you need to accept if you want to keep her as your best friend. There are billions of guys around the world, so you should\u2018ve accepted that this crush is just bad luck and keep your feelings to yourself.\n\nSmall Tip for next time: even if your crushes are unreachable, stay around them. People with certain character traits tend to be around others with the same traits, there is a high chance you get to know more people that might fit even better trough birthdays or get togethers.", "Uhhh what exactly did you think was going to happen here?

If I'm right and this is your protagonist, she's still not likable and just barely redeemable, OP.", "YTA - You made her feel uncomfortable and she's handling it the way she feels is best a.k.a reducing time as a trio. She now knows how you feel - possibly has a better idea than you at this point because I think you're in denial of how deep these thoughts and feelings go - and she's creating some appropriate distance in order to maintain both relationships, decreasing the risk of ruining them. \n\nShe's giving you a chance to get over it by not being around him, because no girl wants her bestie hanging around developing feelings for her partner. She's smart to nip it in the bud now rather than letting you (and your apparant inability to reign in your imagination) and pushing her to cut you loose. You're meant to root for her and her mans relationship, not quietly wish you were in her spot. It may seem harmless now, but you will grow to resent her the more time you spend nurturing this crush on him.\n\nTo be clear, I'm saying YTA because you're angry about her creating some healthy distance. Clearly, you prioritise your brand fucking new aquaintence with her boyfriend over your now threatened friendship with her.", "The whole \u201cdepriving me from him\u201d is what decided the YTA for me", "YTA. She handled this very maturely. Boundaries aren't for punishment or keeping people out, they're to create an environment where the relationship can continue in a healthy way. Your behavior and perception of her message shows a lack of maturity on your part.", "YTA. \n\nWhen I was your age I blabbed everything that came into my brain. Not every thought, feeling and emotion needs to be shared. You are NOT the main character", "She's not \"depriving\" you of anything, get a grip and back off. YTA.", "YTA. You want her to let her keep hanging out with the guy you have a crush on. It is like getting mad at the farmer for not letting your pet wolf hang out with his sheep. Yeah, nothing may happen with this crush, but she should not have to risk that because of you. She still wants to see you and hang out with you, but she does not want you around her BF. If you cannot respect that, you clearly lack respect for your friend.", "I think you\u2019re lucky she is emotionally mature enough to draw a boundary, communicate it clearly with you, and to try to move forward with love for you. \n\nOP you really fucked up. If you feel yourself being pulled toward a friend\u2019s partner in the future, you need to pull yourself away. You created this situation.  YTA.", "Yep sorry but YTA. Your friend set a very healthy boundary to protect both relationships. Respect her decision.", "YTA, just because of how self-inflicted this is. Either focus on your studies or join Tinder, but your friend isn't wrong for establishing boundaries after that interaction. Your feelings aren't just going to suddenly go away", "YTA\nHow did you think it would go? Feelings are just an emotion. You don't need to act on them.\nYou put her an incredibly uncomfortable position. And your concern is you usually hang out with her on Mondays so your plans changed? Or that she's depriving you of a \"genuine friendship\" with her boyfriend? Where is your concern for your relationship with her? Or that your confession might cause her stress?\n\nMy sister drunkenly confessed to having a crush on my husband. She's confessed it multiple times. All it's done is strain our relationship and make it clear she has drinking problem and boundary issues.", "YTA. You can't help having a crush. But you can learn when to keep information like this to yourself. She's absolutely right for setting boundaries, since you can't seem to do this for yourself.", "YTA. But a small one. You keep those feelings to yourself. The chances of anything positive coming from telling your friend you are crushing on her boyfriend that she is going to move in with are so so low. \n\nYou can be mad at your friend, no one can tell you how to feel obviously. But she is setting a very reasonable boundary here. Plus, chances are she is going to tell him you like him, which would have made it pretty awkward anyways.", "Honestly if i was the friend I\u2019d do the same, some things are better kelt to yourself and you shouldn\u2019t be surprised that she wouldn\u2019t be thrilled you have a crush on her bf. You\u2019re absolutely NTA for having feelings for him but YTA for expecting her to be cool with it and being blindsided that she\u2019s not", "This is tough but I'm gonna go with soft YTA\n\nObviously you can't control who you have a crush on or anything, but that's something you should probably have kept inside. However you don't actively seem to be trying to sabotage them or anything. Try to look at it from her perspective; you're in a very new relationship, and you introduce your partner to your friend. Not only do they get along ok, they actually seem to be forming a friendship, and it's awesome! Until one day your friend tells you they have a crush on your partner. Now, whether you want to or not, you're gonna start overthinking things. Do they just get along as friends or are they flirting? Does your partner know and is encouraging the crush? Do they also maybe have a crush back? This is still a new relationship. \n\nDo your best to reassure your friend that you're not trying to snipe her boyfriend, and respect the boundaries they want to set up.", "It\u2019s a good thing she set boundaries, and she did it in a loving and clear way. I don\u2019t think YTA for blurting out your feelings, but YWBTA if you pressed the issue and didn\u2019t respect it/back off. Give them space.", " YTA,  how dumb are you? you should just leave them alone. What kind of friend are you. It looks like you are just looking for a opportunity to sleep with her boyfriend. I am surprised that she still wants to be friends with someone like you.", "YTA. You can\u2019t be serious. She\u2019s being ridiculously generous by sending that nice of a text", "Girl, bye. In what world do you think it\u2019s okay to have a major crush on your friends guy and still be upset that she doesn\u2019t want you around him. She\u2019s being very mature and a lot more graceful than I would be. Time to get new friends and crush on someone who\u2019s single. YTA.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nI find it quite hypocritical that you\u2019re questioning whether she finds you untrustworthy\u2026 when you really have not given her a reason why she should trust you around her bf.\n\nDeveloping feelings for people is uncontrollable.  But you have control over how you approached it.  You recognized that you were crushing on her boyfriend and rather than stepping back and try to let your feelings die\u2026 you\u2019re upset that you can\u2019t develop a further \u201cfriendship\u201d with him.\n\nIf you had told her \u201cyes, I have a crush on him.  I need space from him for a while to get over these feelings\u201d then at least you have given her a reason to trust you, your judgement, and that you have her best interest at heart.\n\nBut the fact that you said \u201cyes, I have a crush on him.  It\u2019s probably hormones.  Oh what?  I can\u2019t spend time with him anymore?  Grr, I\u2019m going to give you the silent treatment\u201d is pretty much affirming that you don\u2019t have her best interest in heart and you still want to play with fire.", "Sounds to me like she waited for her bf to be home before making any decisions. They probably talked about your little declaration and came up with and agreed to these terms together, like a couple. \n\nDespite what you might think, she\u2019s not \u201cdepriving you\u201d of anything. She\u2019s literally the middleman between you and her bf, without her there is no \u201cfriendship\u201d between you and her bf. \n\nLesson learned: some things are better kept to yourself. \n\nYTA", "YTA- If you respected your friend you should have already distanced yourself from her BF when you started thinking you could ever even potentially develop feelings. People make bad decisions, if y'all drink at all this kind of thing could have easily ended your friendship if you drunkenly crossed a line or even just blurted out your feelings to her boyfriend. Friends do betray each other, it happens, sometimes accidentally and sometimes it's on purpose, you have given her something to worry about. \n\nYou should just be happy for her having such a great guy, but you're not, if you were you would be appalled at the thought of romance with someone you're best friend is in love with. You're envious of what she has and that envy would grow over time, eventually causing huge issues and likely destroying the friendship. She doesn't want your friendship to end so she is setting some boundaries, putting distance between you and her BF (like you should have) so that you can get over this crush.\n\n To me it seems very likely that you would have eventually crossed a major line with him. You were gushing over him to his GF, you couldn't help blurting out thay you had a crush (which literally means you have thought about her BF romantically!), and now you seem more upset about her coming between you having a friendship with her BF than you are about spending less time with your best friend! If you really consider her your best friend and you truly love her, you have to respect her wishes and back the fuck off because you are creating a rift and if you press this she may not feel like she can trust you anymore.", "YTA. They are moving in together! If you were a good friend you\u2019d be happy she found someone so wonderful (as you say). Instead you want to take it. He may also be being so kind to you bc she\u2019s your friend. Some blurred lines here.", "YTA. Come on now. Really?", "Soft YTA. You aren\u2019t the asshole for catching feelings. That\u2019s all super normal and human. I also can totally understand why you feel hurt by your friend\u2019s reaction. Put yourself in her shoes for a second, though. Even though she probably knows you\u2019d never throw yourself at him, knowing that you\u2019re interested in him romantically puts a certain amount of awkwardness into your hang outs. So the best way she knows to not feel awkward is to limit your interactions with him for awhile. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d talk to her about it next time we hang out. I\u2019d apologize for  blurting out my feelings at her and tell her that both friendships are too valuable to risk acting on a silly crush. I\u2019d also agree to limit my interactions for awhile  until those feelings were a little less strong.", "What is wrong with you? Seriously? Why in the hell did you think it was a good idea of you to say such a thing? And why do you think you are a good friend in the first place not establishing boundaries YOURSELF once you started feeling this way? And why would you ever think that this guy is your friend? Get a clue, he\u2019s being nice to you for your \u201cfriends\u201d sake. You need a wake up call fast quick and in a hurry. Jesus Christ, of all the millions of people in the world, you decide your \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d bf is the one you like/want. Way to ruin things over a YOU problem", "You're not the asshole for having feelings, or for being open about them, so long as you don't act on them or dwell on them.\n\nHonestly, I don't want to assume too much about your life, but it seems like this is the first decent guy you've met up close and that, in addition to the physical attraction just... well 2+2 = strong attraction. You and your friend have similar tastes in men, not surprising.\n\nWe can't always help our feelings, but we *can* decide what we do about them, and your friend is N T A for setting healthy boundaries now that she knows about your attraction.\n\nI think the best thing for you to do right now is to respect those boundaries until such a time as needed comes up to talk about eventually hanging out with the three of you again. She's not depriving you of anything, she's probably just setting boundaries to protect both her friendship with you and her relationship with her man.\n\nNAH as long as you respect your friend's wishes and deal with your feelings like an adult.", "YTA", "YTA.

Had.\nDo try to restrain yourself from reaching out to her boyfriend.", "Soft YTA, you shouldn't have shared that.

Do you see a situation where you could remain friends with both of them if they broke up? Or even worse, if they broke up and you started dating him?

Firstly, i highly doubt that the friendship you have mentioned between you and the bf is 'genuine' because you clearly have feelings towards him so the relation between the two of you is clearly not platonic, even if just from your side. I wouldn't necessarily blame the friend for asking you to keep your distance from the bf but i do think it was kind of an over reaction as this implies that she either does not trust you around him or has doubts about whether he could potentially catch feelings for you. In any scenario, i think it would be best that you keep some distance between yourself and the bf and try and work out your feelings because having a crush on your best friend's bf is really not ethical.", "NAH. \n\nYou can't control who you have a crush on. \n\nBut your friend is right to not want you around anymore. You can't have your cake and eat it too : you have to choose if you want to be loyal to your friend or pursue your relationship (platonic or not) her bf.

However, you probably should've kept that to yourself. You will be TA if you do act on your feelings for him. However, you probably should\u2019ve kept that to yourself\n\nYour friend is NTA because those boundaries are 100% valid. I would want the same thing if my friend admitted to me that they have a crush on my SO.", "NAH.  Definitely a better move to have kept quiet, for your own self if not anyone else's... that kind of stuff is best kept internally.  But hey, a blurt is a blurt and it's not like you can wave a magic wand to remove those feelings.\n\nShe's made a decision based on that... is it an over-reaction?  *Maayyyybeee.* Or maybe not.", "NAH. But you did put your friend in a tough situation", "You are not an a-hole for how the situation played out.  It could have happened to anyone, and I think you handled it well.  Likewise, however, your friend is not an a-hole for her reaction.  You admitted that it made things awkward, and perhaps she needs time to figure out how to deal with that.   Her text was very kind, and did not place blame on you.  Remember, he was and is her boyfriend long before he was your friend.  The other thing to consider is that she may have revealed this to him and it made him uncomfortable, so don't assume that the text is due to her alone.\n\nAgain, I would not lay fault on anyone in this situation.  Stuff like this happens.  I think you guys will figure it out, and get to a good place.", "NAH\n\nYou did screw up a bit so now she is uncomfortable with you being around her guy. Wouldn't you be uncomfortable with your partner being around someone you know is into them? I wouldn't say anyone was particularly an asshole though.\n\nYou could try to apologize for making it a bit awkward and say that you hope things can be smoothed out in time. Also if you only see or talk to this guy around your friend he probably isn't actually your friend. If he was your friend I'd expect he would be the one to inform you about needing to have some boundaries.", "NAH You just shouldn't have said that, it makes total sense for her to maybe feel weird with you being around her boyfriend if she knows you're attracted to him, would you say he treats you very different than her? Because he could also just be a flirty person who happens to be attractive. If it affects you too much to not see her boyfriend then you probably had fallen since before, you should just like, keep being a friend to your friend and try to make it clear (with actions) that it wouldn't be weird for you all to hang together, do this if it wouldn't actually be weird, if it would be just accept your friends decision it probably is for the better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We are both in our late 20s now but we've known each other since high school. In all those years, our friendship has never been that rocky, until recently.\n\nMy friend and her boyfriend met about 6 months ago. I'm currently in grad school and have chosen to remain single. Before they met, my friend and I would hang out at her place when I was done with classes because she lives close by. But about 4 months ago, the dynamic started to shift to a trio when her boyfriend started to consistently hang out with us. My friend had shown me pictures of him and I always thought he was attractive, but the crush started developing when I met him in person.\n\nI won't go into too much detail, but my friend's boyfriend, who I would consider to be a friend now, is honestly so fun to be around and I always looked forward to hanging out with him after class. Aside from looks (and he's probably the most beautiful man I've ever seen in person) he's really knowledgable and is a great conversationalist, he's a good story-teller and has a good sense of humor. He's super kind and always checks in with me, and seems to know the right words to say to make me feel appreciated. It sounds tropey, but I honestly can't detect anything wrong with him. Which is even more infuriating for me because I actually don't want to have this crush or think about him in a romantic way.\n\nLast week, he went to visit family so hasn't been around. Last Friday, my friend wanted to know what I thought about him, because they were thinking of moving in together. I basically gave her a rundown similar to the last paragraph, and this prompted her to say it sounded like I had a crush on him. She said it in a joking way, so I sort of just laughed it off. But then I just sort of blurted out that I honestly think I do have a crush on him. It got super awkward when I said that and I immediately felt like I screwed up. I tried to downplay it by saying that it was probably just hormones and me being single and basically tried to play it off as a joke.\n\nFast forward to Monday (when her boyfriend came home), my friend sent me this text. It's verbatim: \"Hey \\[my name\\], going forward I think I need to set some boundaries because I don't want \\[his name\\] to become an issue with us. I think from now on we should just hang out on the weekends just the two of us if that's okay. It would make me feel better. Call me and we can talk about it more. Love you lots\"\n\nMy usual routine on Mondays was to go hang out with her after my lecture so I felt kind of blindsided by this. I have not reached out to her since her text. I'm a bit angry with her because I feel like she's implying that she can't trust me around him, and now she's depriving me of a genuine friendship that has grown between me and him. But I also want to know if this is something that is entirely my fault. So kind people of Reddit, AITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I mean she kind of pulled it out on you, questioned you directly and you stumbled through it poorly, but it's still not something you say. I don't think you're an asshole because of how it played out, but she is correctly adjusting her dynamic with you to protect her relationship.\n\nI want to say no assholes, but your relationship has changed and hanging out with this guy is off-limits.", "So your angry that she put boundaries with her relationship from you and how you think she doesn\u2019t trust after you casually said that you had a crush on her bf? Are we sure your in your late 20s? Cause this sounds like middle school/high school drama. Good in your friend for being mature cause if it were anyone else you would have been blasted on social media.", "YTA", "YTA - repeat after me don\u2019t have crushes on your friends or families significant others. This is the female version of why people can\u2019t have friends of the opposite sex. \n\nI don\u2019t really agree with that statement but OP is just kinda out of it. She literally described her best friend\u2019s boyfriend as the most beautiful man she has ever seen. That makes alarm bells ring for anyone. OP\u2019s friend doesn\u2019t trust her now cause she proved she wasn\u2019t trustworthy by developing an infatuation with this guy. And then didn\u2019t even bother to hid it despite it being messed up to have that crush. Like what if they are all drunk sometime and OP shots her shot on an inebriated BF. Seriously just not a good friend.", "YTA, and I\u2019m not sure how you don\u2019t see that. \n\nYou even act like you have some sort of claim on her bf by saying she is now depriving you of his friendship. He is not your friend, he has been friendly. There is a difference. He probably doesn\u2019t want to be around you now either. \n\nI don\u2019t see your friendship lasting much longer, especially if they are going to move in together and their relationship is progressing. I wouldn\u2019t want you around my partner.", "YTA those were inside thoughts OP. Keep them on the inside next time.", "YTA. You crossed a line, what did you think would happen? Of course no one is going to react well to their friend saying I have a crush on your s.o. I love how you say you're \"angry with her\", like seriously? Do you not hear yourself or hold yourself accountable for anything? Because the fact that you don't realize how f-d up this is, is pretty concerning.", "YTA. Not for having a crush, you really can't help feeling how you feel for someone... but YTA for telling her. What did you think she was going to say? \"Oh, good! I know you don't date so I was warming him up for you!\" Like?? It's her BF. Obv she knows all his good qualities. The fact that you're upset over losing this New Friendship and not that you potentially ruined your MUCH LONGER friendship speaks volumes.", "YTA. You are putting your want for a \u201cfriendship\u201d with him over your friendship with her. She is doing exactly the right thing and exactly what you should be doing - putting distance between you and him. That\u2019s how you end your crush.", "YTA\n\nSome things you need to keep to yourself.", "Well obviously YTA, what did you expect? That\u2019s YOUR friend and HER boyfriend.", "So you put your friend in a really awkward position. You should have expected them to uncomfortable here. Even if your friend knows you wouldn\u2019t try anything, they still know. That\u2019s awkward in itself. If you needed to talk to someone else about this then you should have not told this particular friend.", "You feel blind sided?! Imagine how she feels! Respect her boundaries and consider yourself lucky to have such an amazing friend. YTA.", "YTA. Personally I don\u2019t think you tell your friends when you have a crush on their significant other, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily bad if you do if only to make sure they know that they can set boundaries when they feel some sort of romantic feelings line is being crossed. \n\nWhat i DO think is bad, is the way you went about it. You shouldn\u2019t have blurted it out or told her in a joking manner. It should have been a sit down conversation where you say something like you really don\u2019t want to have this crush, he\u2019s just a nice guy, you see the way he treats her and you\u2019re just hormonal about it but you didn\u2019t want to make anyone uncomfortable and just felt she should know. You owe her a *massive* apology because this was just a big uncomfortable fuck up.", "YTA yowza", "What did you think would happen? She\u2019d leave him for you to go get him? Lol yeah, no, it\u2018s not a genuine friendship if one side has romantic feelings. Nope. She\u2018s right in keep the distance between the two of you. YTA", "Holy wow Batman, YTA. Some thoughts can stay inside your head. This man is only friends with you because you are important to your friend. You are not being \"deprived\" of a friendship with him- you only had it in the first place because of her relationship with him, and it sounds like he's a good enough guy he tried to get to know you because you were important to your friend.\n\nHonestly, you need to honor your friend's request for space, and get on dating apps. This infatuation is NOT okay, and if I were your friend, I'd be incredibly close to cutting you out of my life, because your actions are not the actions of a true friend.\n\nThey're going to live together. It is so beyond inappropriate to share with your friend that you have a crush on her boyfriend she's about to LIVE WITH. What were you expecting? Her to tell him, and him to make a grand declaration that it's actually been you all along? That was never gonna happen. All this did was hurt your friend who loves you.\n\nI GUARANTEE she told the boyfriend about this, and he agreed that distance was a great idea, because I'm SURE he isn't okay with you forming a romantic attachment to him when he's just being friendly to his GF's friend. Yikes.", "YTA. You don't tell your best friend you're into her boyfriend is weird as fuck.", "You need to look up the definition of friendship. What did you think you would achieve by telling her you wanted to be with him? (that is what you were saying). Instead of ditching you, she decided to save the friendship by suggesting meeting up with you very frequently, but without him.\n\nThis is the best possible outcome if you can for one second think about your friendship. Who do you think would have their partner around a friend mooning over them? Get a grip and stop being desperate.", "YTA. Main character syndrome much? You didn't have to share your feelings for him, there was literally no reason to not keep that to yourself. She was gracious and correct to set some healthy boundaries. Using the word deprived made me roll my eyes so hard. You're not entitled to a friendship with him or even just casual polite interactions. You choose to create this potentially awkward situation for all 3 of you.", "Are you an asshole?  Kinda!\n\nAre you an idiot?  Definitely!\n\nHaving a crush on your friends SO, is bad enough.  Telling your friend you have a crush on her SO is extremely inappropriate. \n\nHonestly, when you started to develop those feelings you should have started distancing yourself from him all on your own, in order to maintain appropriate boundaries. Since you didn\u2019t take it upon yourself to act appropriately your friend had no choice but to put those boundaries in place herself. Can you really blame her? I can\u2019t!  It sounds like it\u2019s only a matter of time before you make a play for her bf. \n\nNext time a friend asks you what you think of their SO, try going with \u201che seems like a great guy, and if you are ready for the next step of moving in together then I am happy for you both\u201d and leave out all the gushing over him.", "Lolol you said you like your friends boyfriend and your the one blindsided YTA", "OP has never had a bf that is why she cannot conceptualize if shes TA. OP, YTA.", "I am going to go with NAH, you were honest with your friend and that\u2019s good even it was a bit awkward.\n\nBut then your friend was honest with you, she wants to maintain the friendship and is trying to set boundaries so a guy doesn\u2019t come between the two of you.\n\nSpeak to your friend, because IMO she is putting your friendship above her relationship in this matter.", "YTA \n\nnot for telling her. I think that's not that bad provided you then followed by creating distance between you and him. But no YTA for how you reacted to her reaction,  which was... not that. She was very sweet all things considered, but you're mad that she's not comfortable with you having feelings for \\*her\\* man?  She was being gracious, you need to back tf up off her relationship.", "YTA. Honestly, you should start looking for a new friend because this friendship is over. And rightly so. You fucked up hard and crossed a line.", "This is in fact entirely your fault YTA respect her boundaries", "YTA. \n\nYes you should be honest with the people around you but you hurt her by admitting your feelings for him. Now she can't trust you to keep your feelings to yourself. \n\nShe is not depraving you of a friendship with him but she is setting a boundary where her relationship with him is separate with her friendship with you.", "YTA.\n\nYour friend handled this in the kindest and most mature way and you\u2019re mad because she\u2019s uncomfortable with you being around him while you still have feelings for him", "YTA. How old are you again? Because you are way too old to even have to ask this question. Not your fault you have a crush but blurting it out was a bad move. I give your friend credit for trying to keep the friendship alive. It isn't that she can't trust you, it is that you have put her in the position of wondering what the subtext is any time the three of you are together.", "YTA what did you expect?", "You feel *deprived*? You don't deserve her as a friend.\n\nHard YTA.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t know how to quote on mobile, but that last bit where you say, \u201cI\u2019m a bit angry with her now because I feel like she\u2019s implying that she can\u2019t trust me around him, and now she\u2019s depriving me of a genuine friendship between me and him.\u201d Are you serious?

And now OP is like \u201cbut my friendship with him?!\u201d Is that a friendship or is that a crush?? I feel your motivation for hanging out with him is the crush and that\u2019s why a line can be crossed on OP\u2019s part real quick. \n\nAlso you\u2019re mad at your friend and preoccupied with you and her friend\u2019s bf\u2019s friendship rather than your friendship with your own friend.

I think she\u2019s correct to do so.", "YTA\n\nBeen in a similar situation to you before. Those boundaries your friend is setting are good. At this point, it's better to wait for this crush to fade before even thinking about seeing him again. If you continue seeing him things will only get worse and spiral out of control.\n\nYour hurt feelings are because you can't see your crush not because you want to be friends. If you truly value your friendship with him and your best friend, keep some space and wait for things to settle. Hell find someone to go on a date with to start getting your mind off of him. M", "YTA. If I developed a crush on my friend\u2019s partner (it hasn\u2019t ever happened before so this is hypothetical), I wouldn\u2019t tell them. I would figure out how to spend time with my friend without their partner until the crush fades because crushes do fade.\n\nYou cannot expect your friend to encourage you to spend more time with someone she\u2019s dating when you\u2019re crushing on him. That\u2019s just bizarre.", "YTA. Were you hoping your friend would say something like; sharing is caring? \ud83d\ude2d girl no.", "I don\u2019t think you really have a reason to think your friend did anything wrong. If your friend confessed feelings for someone you were dating, you\u2019d probably be uncomfortable with them hanging out, too.\n\nI mean, I\u2019ve dated guys before that a friend or even my old roommate had crushes on. It\u2019s super uncomfortable. I\u2019m not worried about the men cheating, but it\u2019s uneasy knowing somebody else, especially a friend, is fantasizing or even inadvertently flirting with my partner.\n\nGentle YTA, because I don\u2019t think you meant to cause harm. But your friend is definitely being reasonable to set boundaries.\n\nAnd not to overstep, but maybe don\u2019t write off the possibility of dating. Maybe you developed the crush because you still want that affection in your life, despite being busy with grad school. As a bonus your friend might be comfortable hanging out more if she sees you set your sight on someone else.", "Like what did you expect? She now feels threatened by you. I\u2019m going with NTA but good god girl, you\u2019re in grad school. You should have known that wasn\u2019t a wise thing to say. Just respect her boundaries. You made your bed now you have to lie in it.", "YTA. It sucks you found yourself in that situation, but that was your cross to bare. You had to have known that putting that out there was going to have some sort of an impact to your group. What did you want your friend to do with that information?", "NAH. Your friend is setting boundaries for a reason; she \\*can't\\* trust you. Respect that and make other friends.", "NTA. I\u2019m giving my answer specific to context, so take it with a grain of salt. \n\nCrushes aren\u2019t voluntary, so I understand how you may feel. However, your friend has a valid point in setting boundaries to keep it respectful. For all we know, the BF may have been thinking the same so for everyone involved, a step back may be best for preserving friendships. \n\nWith that said, I think the crush is infatuation and would have passed naturally on its own. You said he is the only man that caught your interest, but who\u2019s to say that more won\u2019t come along later? My advice would be to address what was said face to face with your friend, complete with new boundaries she\u2019s comfortable with.", "NTA\n\n\nGood grief. It's just a crush, not an obsession.", "NTA. I would go no contact with that friend since she clearly doesn\u2019t trust you after being honest to her question.", "NTA cause it wasn't an AH move, but what did you actually think would happen?", "NTA - if she's your best friend you should be able to be 100% honest.  Your bestie should also know that you'd NEVER cross lines and come onto her BF sexually.  Continue to be completely honest with her about your feelings, and also tell her you'd NEVER violate your friendship by being inappropriate with her man.   \n\nThis is advice from a 50 year old woman, so take it for what it is.  If you know that you'd never cheat, and if your friendship with your bestie is that important 100% honesty and transparency is critical.  Good luck!", "NTA for telling her but you should understand that she's uncomfortable and respect her boundaries.", "NAH, but you should ask if he can maybe go find something else to do on Monday so your schedule/routine doesn't also change.", "NTA.  You developed a crush and did not act on it. You are happy for your friend and her BF. When you look for a romantic partner, who isn't him, you now know what qualities you are looking for.  You were honest with your friend when she asked the question. I think most of my friends think I have an amazing wife and would say they wish their wives looked, acted, or treated them like my wife treats me, but there is no action. YTA if you would have made any move or acted in any way.", "NAH- You cannot control your feelings so you're not TA for that. You could say you never should have told her but I honestly think that was smart. Imagine if you hadn't said anything moving forward and you end up making a move on him at some point in time? that would have destroyed the friendship. Whereas now that she knows how you feel she can implement boundaries to protect the feelings of everyone involved. She of course is NTA and I think handles the situation perfectly.", "So I feel like you didn't realize you had a crush on him (or maybe didn't allow yourself to acknowledge it) until she said it outloud and at that point you were realizing it yourself and were \"thinking outloud\" so to speak.  Which being with a good friend, had it been any other guy, would have been ok. \n\nHowever, she has asked to limit contact between you and him because it is what she is comfortable with. I think by her letting you know ahead what her boundaries are, you should respect that.\n\n It isn't necessarily about trust as in you will immediately jump him, but more of her having time to process this and figure out her own feelings and a way you can all 3 co exist together. \n\n By coming to you first instead of holding in her thoughts, she is trying to maintain your friendship and her relationship with this guy.  It may suck for you, but she is trying to balance a meaningful friendship with you and respect your feelings while also having feelings of her own for you and for her bf. And if it's getting to the level of moving in, then I think she is well within her right of being respectful to your feelings by letting you know and offering to talk on the phone. \n\nAssure her you will not act on these feelings and respect her wishes of hanging out alone for a while and go from there. She respected you, as long as you respect her, I will vote NTA.", "~~hi, genuinely curious.~~\n\n~~At what point did she cross a line?~~\n\n~~Should she have just kept her feelings to herself instead of being open and honest with her friend?~~\n\n~~Idk, I just feel like in my experience things left unsaid tend to grow rather than go away, and that could have led to worse problems.~~\n\nEdit:\n\nI can tell by the downvotes that this was read as an argument, I didn't intend it to be. I have not been in that particular situation, so like I said, I was genuinely curious what the reasoning behind cranbeery's comment was.\n\nI think it's great that boundaries are being set, and I think at no point should adolescent-level fantasies about a friend's partner be indulged, however, I also don't feel that anyone can help who they are attracted to.Having feelings of attraction is not crossing a line in my opinion, but dwelling on them, or indulging in them certainly would be.\n\nEdit 2: The Sequel  \n\n\nAfter further reflection and many of you making great points, I understand where I'm a bit wrong on this.

She couldn't even moderate the words she used when she told her friend what she thought about him!", "Exactly right. OP getting upset that her friend is \u201cdepriving her of a friendship with the boyfriend\u201d  is so unbelievably self-centered.

Inevitably it will cause concern and opens the door to a lot of uncomfortable moments. Does she get to tell her when she fights with her boyfriend? If they talk one on one to plan something, does she have to worry? If she tells her something good that happened is she hurting her?\n\nIt's like unfounded jealousy, you talk about it with your trusted friends and not with your partner, at least not until you weed out the crazy because inevitably it will make them feel you don't trust them.\n\nWe don't have to share everything with everyone.\n\nEdit: grammar (mobile)", "There may be dissenting opinions on this but, to me, she crossed a line when she started to indulge romantic thoughts or feelings about the bf. \n\nThinking things like \u201che\u2019s probably the most beautiful man I have ever seen\u201d or \u201che knows the right words to make me feel appreciated\u201d are fine and dandy as we can\u2019t always control our thoughts.

Her friend has been awesome and if OP really does want to stop crushing, she should be thanking, or at least agreeing, with her friend about some distance.  Denial is a real thing but seems like OP is weirdly blind to it or is just flat out lying to thousand of people.  Which... Is also bizarre in and of itself.", "Because you look at something from a different view and come to different conclusions", "Ahhh yes. My apologies.

I wasn't even trying to argue, I was just genuinely curious as to what the reasoning was, because I haven't found myself in that particular predicament.   \n\n\nI do think I'd rather have my friend be open and honest about their feelings (and of course I'd set boundaries!) then have feelings for my partner and never share them. That seems inherently more deceptive.", "Honestly it was much nicer than I probably would be if my friend admitted to having feelings for my partner.

Lol", "Why should they be understanding about you saying something so disrespectful, line-crossing, and trust breaking? It's like you don't have to have understanding for anyone else, but they should all have it for you, because you're the center of the universe. You're not responsible for anything you say or do and everyone should center your feelings while you ignore theirs. There's nothing approrpiate whatsoever about leaning into your crush on a friend's boyfriend so much that you get to the point that you blurt about about it.

Not every thought needs to be expressed. Now OP had introduced an air of doubt about her intentions. Maybe she would never act upon them, but now she is upset because the friendship has changed.

You were just being honest, and (based on your account) you didn't state any desire to act on the \"kind of\" crush you have.\n\nThat said, I think your friend's response is completely reasonable. Boundaries are important, and she is clearly setting some to make sure she can maintain a good relationship with you and with her boyfriend.\n\nIn time, when your friend realizes that you were just being honest with her, I'd expect things to ease up on the separation of you and the BF.

The last time I spoke to her (one of my best friends of 2 years and my roommate!!!) was the day before I broke up with him. To this day they still post pictures out at bars together. Your friend has every right to keep a distance, she's being nicer than I would if I could do it again. Nothing happened between my ex and my friend, I know for sure.

People here think honesty makes you AH.  Your friend being cautious nothing wrong with just the two of you hanging out like before", "YTA. There's several reasons here.\n\n1 - You put your friend in a very tight situation. You should have never blurted out that you liked him. You can't justify that by \"not being able to control it\" because you CAN control it. It's not that difficult. Smarten up.\n\n2 - Once you started crushing on your friend's bf, as a person in their late 20s who is probably atleast somewhat mature, you should have put some distance from him instead of hanging out with him constantly. Just because he wanted to form a trio with you and you friend does not mean you have to be there all the time. You need to give her and her bf some space for themselves.\n\n3 - The way you explained in the post was like you are upset that she \"took something away from you\" - You said shes depriving you of a 'genuine friendship' that has grown between you and him. Let me be blunt with you here, he's probably only hanging out with you because you are close with his gf. If he is really as great as you say, he would never have the intention of cheating or replacing his gf for some chick she's friends with. Let me give you a reality check though. She is NOT depriving you of a 'genuine friendship', she is setting boundaries to keep your friendship and her relationship healthy. Nothing wrong with that. You sound very immature.   \n\n\nHonestly, how did you expext her to react? \"You are good friends with me so we can both date him\" lmao", "NTA - You were honest. There's nothing wrong with having feelings, you can't stop them really. If she's insecure about you, then that's her problem, but it seems like she tried to be kind about it at least.

I don't know how to make it clearer. The confession was unnecessary and shouldn't have been made. This isn't honesty, it's self indulgence. OP wasn't thinking about her friend's feelings, only her own. Confessing her feelings was hurtful to her friend and undermined the trust in the relationship. I don't know anyone who would feel comfortable with their partner hanging out with someone who had confessed to an attraction. There are some secrets you just have to bear in silence if you sincerely care about how other people feel. This was a thoughtless and immature thing to do."]}
