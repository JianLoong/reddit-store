The stove gets a little dirty sometimes and the wood floor isn\u2019t always spotless, and my bathroom is not scrubbed down sparkly clean, but we are clean. Living in this environment with my roommate has made me realize how dirty my parents home is. There are crumbs all over the counters, food left out not covered from the night before, dishes up to the top of the sink, dirty ass floors, the bathroom is covered with grime, there\u2019s gunk (seriously, I don\u2019t even know) around the appliances, etc. I\u2019m anxious being here. Which makes me so sad because I love being here and my parents do everything for me I don\u2019t want to criticize them. But out of frustration this morning I told my mom \u201cThings need to change. This kitchen is too dirty.\u201d The kitchen is without a doubt the worst part. She said \u201cThis is just how we live. That\u2019s a really rude thing to say. How would you feel if someone came into your house and said that?\u201d And I said \u201cI\u2019d feel like I need to start keeping things cleaner\u201d. My mom is very quick to anger so I calmly kept it at that, but in reality I\u2019d be mortified. Anyways, since this conversation my mom has been cleaning the kitchen loudly and angrily, telling my dad I called them pigs and how rude my comment was. There are so many other things I wanna say too. We\u2019ve had a great dane for 6 years and she has never had a bath. She STINKS. She\u2019s a very happy dog but she\u2019s very snappy due to past trauma. But we had a dog before and we never gave her baths either. Likewise, I dropped a cannoli on the dirty kitchen floor last night and my mom blew on it and said \u201ci\u2019ll give it to your dad or brother its fine 5 second rule\u201d.

The house was disgusting.  When my parents passed away my siblings and I had to clean out the house.  We filled multiple large dumpsters with garbage.  It took four of us over a month to get it cleaned out.  They never threw out old bread wrappers with the moldy, slimy ends still in them, they just set the fresh bread on top of the old.  The stack was about four feet high.  That was just one of the many awful things we found.\n\nOn the plus side, I found my missing Chamaeleon, he was under the refrigerator.  He had been missing for about thirty years.\n\nWe often tried to help them clean, but hoarders can\u2019t stand anything to be thrown away.  They would just start making the same messes over again.", "This sounds like a very sensitive topic for them. You\u2019re not an asshole, just to get that out of the way. Sometimes people are very comfortable living the way they are living- they don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. To them this is their normal. When you come into anyone\u2019s life and try to change their perception of reality, sometimes it\u2019s natural for their defenses to go up. It\u2019s intense. It would be intense for her most likely to really recognize her situation. I would say it might be better to be more indirect- maybe to offer to help clean. Maybe she feels judged. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s your responsibility to help or to help her not feel judged or something\u2014 but that\u2019s just my opinion on the psychological inner workings. When people feel criticized, their defense mechanisms go up even if you\u2019re just trying to help them out. \n\nThere are little things you can do slowly. They won\u2019t change all at once- maybe ever. This can be a situation that feels difficult to accept. I myself would be very stressed out in a dirty environment like that. But I think just recognizing where you have power and where you should just let things be might help in the long run perhaps.", "NAH. You\u2019re not the asshole for being upset that the home you love is filthy. I can tell you love your parents. I grew up in a very, very dirty house, too. I also didn\u2019t realize how bad it was until I moved out and kept my own living space clean. Going home still makes me upset because I can\u2019t relax in that environment and it makes me very upset/sad that my mom lives like that. I have literally cried that she is willing to live in such an unclean place, because I know her depression is the problem, but she refuses to get help of any kind. I understand why you said what you said. It wasn\u2019t an over the top comment, although I\u2019m assuming your tone was frustrated, but not overly disgusted (info?).\n\nHowever, it\u2019s probably time to recognize that there\u2019s a reason your family is living that way. Maybe there is no work/life balance, maybe mom or dad is depressed and unable to bring themselves to clean, maybe all cleaning responsibilities have shifted onto one party who is overwhelmed. I suspect they are not assholes, but people who probably need to get some help (especially if depression is the culprit) so they can manage their home better.", "NtA.  We learn from each other. Now your parents get to learn how to keep a house clean from you.", "There is a huge difference between having a cluttered and messy home and living in filth. \n\nOne doesn't have to be a neat freak in order to have an environment that is safe to eat in.\n\nNta", "You wasted a cannoli? Totally TA! Joking, ew gross, NTA. That said you must have an immune system that can fight off anything...", "NTA. I grew up in a house like this and never realized how much it impacted my health (mental and physical) until I moved out. It causes so much anxiety for me to visit my family now, because they still live like that and to me it is not only uncomfortable to be in but it also brings up many feelings of \u201cwhy couldn\u2019t they have given me a clean home as a child?\u201d and \u201cwhy are they so unmotivated to do this, are they depressed?\u201d I can\u2019t eat when I go to visit them, the emotions of it all make me nauseous. \n\nSo after a couple visits like this I was honest with them as much as I could be. Like yours, my parents are immediately extremely defensive about anything. It really had to come from a place of compassion and \u201cI\u2019m struggling\u201d not \u201cyou need to change.\u201d That can be very hard to do, but that\u2019s what I encourage you to do moving forward. Speak to them on how it effects YOU, not what THEY are doing and what you think of it morally.", "NTA. But why are you telling this just to your mom? Is your dad to disabled to do anything in the house?", "NTA people who live in filth like that may have mental illness but that dosent make it okay and to feed someone food that feel on a dirty floor of disgusting. Learning better habits then our parents  is expected and your parents excuse of its how we live is an excuse to be lazy and not teach their children how to keep house for when they move.", "Ugh, I hate to say this because I\u2019m on your side, but NAH, bordering on Y T A if you bring it up further or push them on it.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: they\u2019re adults, and it\u2019s their house. Yes, it sounds vile. No, I wouldn\u2019t want to be there either. Yes, they should clean it up. But\u2026 given that you are also an adult, with your own living space, you can\u2019t really set terms for how they take care of their living space. If you were a dependent child who was trapped there, I\u2019d feel differently, but you aren\u2019t. And they\u2019re apparently okay living in filth. And\u2026 well, pushing them on it is unlikely to actually *do* anything anyway (just ask any child of a hoarder parent).\n\nYou are, however, entirely within your rights to stay at a hotel or refuse to eat food that comes out of the kitchen or whatever other boundary you set. You just don\u2019t really have grounds to insist that they clean up. Or any leverage to make that happen, for that matter.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, though. It sounds really, really gross.", "NTA it isnt healthy for them to live that way and it's disturbing that they treat it as okay.", "NTA, just didnt go about it the best way. In my experience, people dont tend to change their level of cleanliness/tidiness. Everyone has their own level of cleanliness. There would be people who think the way you live is too dirty/messy no matter how clean or tidy you are. IMO you either have to get past it or treat yourself to a hotel when when you're visiting the area. But id you do decide to go down ghe hotel/staying at a friends route, dont let on to your parents that its about them. It would only hurt them and not have a useful outcome. My brother and his family are like this but far worse. I know it irritates them when my mum starts washing up to 'help', but they find it overbearing as it's something they didn't ask for. I prefer to ask them our for coffee than to visit when we meet. I used to have the same when I lived with my sister. I was the only one bothering to do basic housework and would get frustrated that I couldn't keep up with it. But I learnt in the end, it's their home, their choice. Now if its at a level where they're hoarders and it's massively impacting their quality of life, then a soft compassionate approach to encouraging them to change would help. I would gently apologise for saying what you said, explain that you weren't intending to offend but that you just feel anxiety around a certain level of mess.", "NTA... When you lived with someone else, you got an insight into how others live. There are all kinds of families with all kinds of cleanliness / hygiene practices. Now that you know better, why not bathe the dog yourself, and do things that you can? I think you could start doing things yourself around the house when you visit, and then explain to your mom that being in other spaces made you realise how it affected you mentally / emotionally. If your mom is open to it, please do share studies / data with her about how our spaces affect us. It is possible that she could be more open to your perspective once you share facts?", "NAH. OP is understandably is concerned. Likewise if someone said this to me, I too would have said \"How would you feel if someone came into your house and said that?\" Would have been better to stress the health risks of the kitchen rather than the \"dirty\" part which might sound like a value judgement, even if that wasn't the intention.", "NTA\n\nWhile you're their child, you're also a guest and had to live in that.\n\nIf someone came to their house and saw that, they would be hesitant to sit anywhere or eat off the plates.", "YTA. As gross as it is, it\u2019s not your house. It is really judgemental of you to say that. Tbh if it really bothers you, you could try clean up a bit yourself? Same with the dog situation, you could have washed them if it upset you?", "NTA. I get you want the best for your parents, but they can make their own decisions. I, personally, am concerned for that dog. Surprised, they\u2019re still around.", "Yta. These are your parents- you probably should have helped them out while you were there.", "NAH - they live how they live, and it isn\u2019t killing anyone. However, you\u2019re allowed to be grossed out by it and minimize your exposure to it. Just be clear with your communication: \u201cI love you, but I can\u2019t eat food that was prepared in such a dirty kitchen\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t spend the night if there is a quarter inch of toothpaste buildup on the bathroom faucet\u201d Give them clear expectations and boundaries.", "A bit YTA.  You lived in the house and seems like didn\u2019t attempt to keep it cleaner before you moved out.  When you came home it didn\u2019t sound like you were helping with dishes when this discussion happened.\n\nSo it\u2019s a little hypocritical for you to be mad now after 22 years while not trying to help.  Habits are hard to break.", "NTA but almost TA because of your approach, you need to approach this differently, a lot of people struggle with cleaning. I agree it sounds like their house is a disgusting health hazard but there might be a mental health issue at play here. Maybe be kinder with your approach, offer to help them clean it? Offer to give the dog a bath? Walking into someone\u2019s home and just yelling how gross they are isn\u2019t the best approach", "YTA - You are in their home, so you keep your opinion to yourself. If you are not comfortable in their home due to it not being clean to your standards, then you don't have to visit them.", "YTA. If you had any manners you would have simply cleaned it and let them see the difference. \n\nCan we agree not to have the \"obsessively sterile living conditions cause hypersensitivity to certain compounds eg nut allergies' conversation? I say this not to OP but others who have a dirt phobia.", "Hi! My parents house is the same way, and I\u2019m living here currently. I feel gross, I do what I can to clean, but you can\u2019t change their ways. It\u2019s their space, the have a right to keep it how they want it.", "Esh. Clean the kitchen yourself? I'm not super great at housework, but make a big effort to keep on top of it. I also expect my kids to pitch in.", "YTA. You are a grown woman and could clean it yourself. Instead you treat your parents like servants only there to serve your needs.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like they way they live why are you there? You can either leave or clean it yourself if it bothers you so much but I\u2019d go with the former", "YTA Sorry, if you don't like the way someone keeps their house, then don't go there.", "She must have secretly agreed if she started angry cleaning. If she didn\u2019t agree she would have said fu. NTA", "YTA. It\u2019s not your house. Don\u2019t like it? Don\u2019t go there, or pitch in. It\u2019s hard being an adult and things fall behind as you get older. You don\u2019t have energy any more; your body hurts; you have a house to run and a job to work and family to entertain and care for. \n\nYou\u2019re welcome to live your life how you want, but it\u2019s disrespectful for you to tell someone else how to live their life in their own home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did you not notice, or just think it was normal? If it is new, your mom may be having some issues with depression, or dementia, or mental illness, or drugs. Does she go to the doctor regularly? Maybe you can see to it that she gets a check up. You mentioned your brother. How old is he? Does he live there? How does he feel about it?", "ESH, you do come across as judgemental in your chosen wording.", "My grandmother passed recently. It took months of sneakily cleaning (she was already ill and was stuck upstairs due to stairs being difficult for her), and then just tossing things out left and right for a few weeks after her death. Even then, there was still junk. She just kept buying things all. The. Time. We have some clothing that she had basically buried in a closet, several cleanings later and they still smell musty. It's *so* gross", "There are also dog groomers, who know how to clean a nervous dogs.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss.  It is so hard to go through all the things, but you are wonderful to take on the task.", "Did they never been in friends' houses? Relatives?", "Good point.

Many people who grow up like this also grow up very isolated.", "Even if they know it isn\u2019t normal, they still don\u2019t know what to do about it. People aren\u2019t born knowing how to clean or especially the routine it takes to KEEP things clean. When I moved out, I eventually realized that while I knew how to clean a filthy room (my parents would go on short lived cleaning fits) I had absolutely no idea how to maintain a clean house. Like what had to be done daily and weekly to keep things clean. Took several years for me to find what worked for me to be able to have a house I wasn\u2019t embarrassed if someone stopped by unexpectedly. \n\nAnd again, as a child, very difficult to try and clean up after people who are making no effort.", "It doesn't matter whether OP lives there or not. It is her parents' house, she can offer to help cleaning instead of bluntly stating that the kitchen is dirty. Then the mother probably wouldn't be that defensive.", "I help cleaning my mother's apartment, if she asked me to do something, although I live in a different country and visit maybe once a year. I remember her helping her mother, when I was a child. There is nothing wrong asking for help, if for some reason you can't do it on your own.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like you haven\u2019t personally experienced this level of uncleanliness. Because in my experience people who  live like this absolutely get defensive if you start cleaning/offer to help clean.", "NTA I know someone like this, she smells and no one will eat her food after seeing her kitchen. Sadly she thinks she is clean. Her DIL won\u2019t let the kids go to her house, it\u2019s that dirty.", "NTA but I do think you should reconsider your approach. I can see how your mom was able to take offense with the manner which you approached the level of household hygiene, even though I don't think that current level of household maintenance is acceptable. It shouldn't have to be a conversation that is tiptoed around, cleanliness should be a given for functioning adults, but sadly that isn't necessarily the case. I say this from personal experience coming from a very unclean household and having to learn how to clean entirely on my own. \n\nComing in with \"things need to change\" can easily be misconstrued as you trying to assert a position of unwarranted authority and judgement. In a parent-child relationship, that type of offense can be particularly amplified if you've been provided for sans the lack of cleanliness. You also defend this approach with the assertion that if any old person came into your home and judged you, you would twist and bend yourself to relieve yourself of that judgement. That's not necessarily a mature or healthy mentality itself, it gives an air that you yourself don't know where to draw the line when it comes to genuine cleanliness. I've lived with housemates before who had parents come by when the house was mostly clean save for a few spots and they would turn their noses up, being notorious clean freaks, claiming that their adult child has a dust allergy and that \\~I\\~ am going to send them to the ER for not cleaning down to every minute detail. The housemate didn't actually have a dust allergy. We're talking about common spaces that were not 100% my responsibility and messes that were not caused by me. I wouldn't take that as a welcome judgement or considerate remark that I need to step up. \n\nApproach with cold hard facts about the health risks that come with a lack of cleanliness. Because right now you give them the impression that you're coming in on a high horse that you live so much better than her after having lived a very brief period independently. Point out the cold hard facts of what can happen to a dog's health if they go unwashed for years at a time. Find the articles on what can happen if you eat food right off a dirty floor. Hell, there's plenty of articles that can describe how not properly storing cooking utensils can make a person sick if they're unlucky enough. Come at this with repeated insistence that you wanting things to change comes from a place of care and concern, not judgement and unwarranted authority. Offer a helping hand (but do your best to not end up offering to take the brunt of the work yourself) in your free time to help bring things up to standard so that everyone has an easy starting ground with keeping things clean. Maybe some gentle questioning about your own mother's and father's background and how they grew up to gain some clarity as to why they think XYZ unhealthy habits are okay and shouldn't be scrutinized. More often than not, situations like this actually point to such folk coming from an even dirtier, neglected household and this is actually a marked improvement in their eyes. But they may not know how to keep moving from there, and a lot of people feel it is harder to change as they age. There's lots of possibilities here. \n\nShould you have to tiptoe to carefully explain the necessities of cleaning to grown adults? **No.** But if you actually want things to change, rather than just asserting your disapproval, you're going to have to rethink your approach.", "That terrifies me - that one day I\u2019ll be unable to manage, or that the house deteriorates with general wear and tear till it looks dirty.", "NTA. Can you make cleaning a fun family activity? For example, do you have siblings that can help (e.g., blast some music, assign each person a room to clean, give rewards for cleanest room, fastest worker, etc)? Can you gift a housekeeping session or get them to hire cleaners until they get a handle on the mess? Buy some cleaning products you can use while there? It\u2019s awful to have to switch roles with your parents, but think about what will happen if this is allowed to continue as they age and you become their primary caregiver.", "Dead chameleon?", "And they\u2019re adults content to live that way.\nUnless it\u2019s a real biohazard or the house is falling down there\u2019s no point arguing.

The first two were easier because the owners were already dead, and you didn\u2019t have to worry about hurting their feelings. OP is describing messy, not hoarded.  I\u2019d take stray dog fur over an accumulation of actual dead mice under two broken refrigerators full of rotten food anytime.\n\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to hit a few corners of my house with a Dustbuster \ud83d\ude2c", "It's not your house. If you aren't okay with it, you have two choices: clean it or don't stay there.

Some thirty-two years later, I had to to drive by the old house several times on my way to see a home care client, and saw that the house was open and a huge roll-off dumpster was being filled with the house\u2019s contests. The next week, another dumpster was being filled. The the house was only about 700 square feet, plus  a small storage shed . My third trip by, the house was torn down. I can\u2019t imagine how he had enough room to live there.", "Petrified.", "I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s relevant here.", "Typo should have read it\u2019s not a legit Health hazard.

Mold is not built up oil and gunk on appliances.\n\nIn general cross contamination of utensils and cutting boards is how good poisoning in homes happens.  Raw chicken not washing then handling cooked chicken.  That is independent of cleanliness", "YNTA.  That's gross.  I don't know if you were raised in that kind of filth, but I know some one who was raised like that and it really messes with a kid and stays with you thru adulthood.

I\u2019m sure that for the first 18ish years of your life you contributed to this mess. You have a dog but it never occurred to you that maybe YOU can give her a bath too?
