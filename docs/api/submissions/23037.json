This year the group was one of the sponsors for one of our town's festivals. I was really excited and nervous about this because I was helping organize and run our booth, and speak to raise awareness about what we do.\r  \n\r  \nI was picked as one of two people to speak during our stage time and that had me extra nervous on top of everything else. The festival was free admission so I did ask my friends and family for some support, especially the day I was going to be speaking and to please just give feedback about how we all did.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, 2 weeks ago my girlfriend(27F) had to put her cat down and she's been really depressed about it. I've been doing all I could for her to be there for her, support her, and get and do nice things for her while also juggling getting ready for the festival. I asked her if she'd come for a little bit during one of the festival days and she said she would try.\r  \n\r  \nShe didn't make it any of the three days and said she just wasn't up to being around a lot of people still. My parents and some friends did and were great with support. When the festival wrapped up, my parents said they'd take us (me, my friends that showed up, and the other person working the booth) out for dinner for a job well done.\r  \n\r  \nHere's where I might be the a-hole: I didn't invite her since she had said she wasn't up for being around people and my parents had only mentioned those they saw at the festival any of the days. While we were eating she text asking me if I wanted to pick up dinner to eat at her place with her. I told her I was already eating out with my parents. She got mad that I didn't invite her along. I offered to bring her something from the restaurant and explained my parents had only invited the people they saw at the festival. She's still mad at me and says I should've invited her by default so AITA?\r", "created_utc": 1690217186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158fyca/aita_for_not_inviting_my_girlfriend_to_a/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can't get mad at you  for her inconsistencies.  She owes you an apology for not supporting you. Finally, your parents didn't invite her.", "She wanted you to invite her to something you were invited to? That's wild. You were neither hosting nor paying, so that would have been completely inappropriate. She needs to check her privilege at the door. NTA", "NTA. I get that her cat died, and that is tragic, but she said she didn\u2019t want to be around people and didn\u2019t show up at the festival. She had three days to show up to support you and didn\u2019t.", "NTA Your parents invited you and your friends to dinner. It really wasn't your place to extend an invitation to your girlfriend on their behalf. If your parents wanted to invite her, I am sure they would have told you, give Gertie a call and see if she'd like to join us.", "NTA You were not the host. It's that simple.", "NTA. She wasn't up to going on any of the three days and she told you she wasn't up for being around people. And your parents invited the people that were there at the time. You offered to bring her something from the restaurant and that's good enough.", "NTA. You were invited as a guest, you were not the host. You were also giving her the space she (indirectly) told you she needed at that time. The fact that she's still upset with you for having dinner with your parents without her makes me wonder if she's looking for a little extra attention.", "NTA, she made a decision that was believed to be right for her at that moment.  She doesn't have a right to be angry at you because she chose to be alone.  She would not share in your moment, therefore she was not asked to attend the celebratory dinner.", "NTA. She was raw over her cat, and took it out on you. I bet she knows what she did, and is probably not proud of it.", "NTA your reasoning is sound. \n\nShe sounds like she will only come if it benefits her. She is currently mad at you because deep down she knows that she is wrong.", "NTA, your girlfriend needs therapy or something. It sounds harsh but she can\u2019t expect everyone to pitter patter around her just because she\u2019s depressed - you did nothing wrong", "Girlfriend need to realize your parents did the inviting, so it was never up to you who did and didn\u2019t go to dinner. You can\u2019t just invite her along when someone else is treating. NTA, and she has some maturing to do.", "NTA. She communicated that she wasn\u2019t in the mood to be around people, and you had no control over who your parents invited.", "NTA... She didn't want to be around people.  You aren't a mind reader.  Sounds like she could be around people if there was something in it for her.  Seriously, in relationships, you have to show up for each other even when you don't feel like it.  The people that show up for you are the ones you should keep.  \nAlso... it was your parents who invited, not you.  They didn't extend the invitation to her.  So I don't see any way that you are at fault here.", "NTA.  She sounds like she is looking for things to be upset about.  She didn\u2019t want to be around people, you respected her wishes.  Your parents took out the people that showed up, you honored their wishes.  If she wants to live by \u201cshoulds\u201d then she should have said in advance, even if I don\u2019t come out, I would still like to get dinner with you afterwards, but she didn\u2019t.  \n\nI see her in full victim energy here.  Don\u2019t let this bother you.  This isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA. It was a spur of the moment dinner request. I honestly wouldn't have thought to stop and invite her.", "NTA. It was an oversight not to invite her but understandable considering the circumstances. And you offered to bring her dinner, which is what she originally wanted.", "NTA.  Your parents issued the invite to you and your friends.  Funny that GF wasn't up to attend something important to you but was totally on board for dinner.", "It comes across to me as \"You're spending your attention on other people? How dare you!\" I absolutely adore my animals and have been devastated anytime I lost one, but I would still have made sure to make an appearance for my husband at something that important. Her needs are not the most important ones in the relationship. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It would have cost him nothing to ask, but that doesn't make him TA.", "Sounds like she just wanted you to bring her food, honestly...\n\nNTA.", "Your communication with your gf sucks", "Do you two normally eat dinner together like is it a daily thing?", "I was so ready to tell you that you showed her she wasn't important for you enough for you to want her to be there to celebrate. However nope nope nope. NTA\n\nI get her sorrow on her lost. And so often people don't get how loosing an other species friend can hurt so deeply. \n\nHowever, the invitation was made from your parents for those who were participating in your achievement.  \nYour girlfriend made it clear she wasn't up to see anybody. Not even to show you support for days. So why would you ask her to go to the celebration diner?\n\nFirst you would have had to ask the others, if they didn't mind her coming. Then ask her if she wanted, without making her feel obligated. Anyway you were respecting her wishes.  \nShe insisted and showed she was not willing to be around people. To the point she wouldn't show you support for days. If you had asked,  I have the feeling she would have said you tried to pressure her. Accusing you of making her feel guilty.", "NTA\n\nIt is really rude to invite people when you aren't the host. I have a friend who does this and it is so obnoxious.\n\nYou could have asked your parents if she was included, but considering the circumstances it's understandable that you didn't.", "NTA. It is sad to lose a pet. But if your gf has decided life is now going to be shut down until further notice (unless she can get a free dinner), perhaps you should go your separate ways.", "NTA\n\nIf she wasn\u2019t up to being around people she wasn\u2019t up to being around people.", "NTA-  she can\u2019t support you at a festival but she can go to a free dinner?  That\u2019s says it all.", "NTA.  If she's not up to support you at the festival, I don't see why she would be invited for a meal your parents are paying for to celebrate it after.  If she had been at the event, she probably would have been invited.  Maybe a text saying won't be home for dinner would have been nice, but that's about all.", "What kind of audacity is this! NTA", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t up to you to do the inviting. But if your parents asked if you wanted to invite her and you didn\u2019t bother to ask her because you were salty, well, then that would be a different scenario potentially.", "NTA overall but do you actually want her to come bc I kind of feel like your parents would not mind...", "NTA. She was too depressed to come and support you, but not too depressed to go out for a free meal?", "Why a few people she knows at a dinner is a much different crowd than a huge festival of random\npeople you don't know with loud noises all around.", "I think she\u2019s TA not necessarily for her lack of support but for deflecting his event success to focus on her disappointment over something he could not have foreseen.", "Not daily, we eat dinner together 2-3 nights a week.", "You're right. A festival is MUCH EASIER, because you can wander around, barely speak, and leave when you want.", "Yikes. So my line of thinking was she was angry because it's a daily thing. Wow she really couldn't be bothered to show up one day for you but expects to be treated for work she didn't do. And you were kind enough to offer to bring her dinner! Grief affects us all differently but selective socializing is a new one for me!"]}
