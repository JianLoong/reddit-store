She doesn't have a right to be angry at you because she chose to be alone.  She would not share in your moment, therefore she was not asked to attend the celebratory dinner.", "NTA. She was raw over her cat, and took it out on you. I bet she knows what she did, and is probably not proud of it.", "NTA your reasoning is sound. \n\nShe sounds like she will only come if it benefits her. She is currently mad at you because deep down she knows that she is wrong.", "NTA, your girlfriend needs therapy or something. It sounds harsh but she can\u2019t expect everyone to pitter patter around her just because she\u2019s depressed - you did nothing wrong", "Girlfriend need to realize your parents did the inviting, so it was never up to you who did and didn\u2019t go to dinner.

Sounds like she could be around people if there was something in it for her.  Seriously, in relationships, you have to show up for each other even when you don't feel like it.  The people that show up for you are the ones you should keep.  \nAlso... it was your parents who invited, not you.  They didn't extend the invitation to her.

And so often people don't get how loosing an other species friend can hurt so deeply. \n\nHowever, the invitation was made from your parents for those who were participating in your achievement.  \nYour girlfriend made it clear she wasn't up to see anybody. Not even to show you support for days. So why would you ask her to go to the celebration diner?\n\nFirst you would have had to ask the others, if they didn't mind her coming. Then ask her if she wanted, without making her feel obligated. Anyway you were respecting her wishes.  \nShe insisted and showed she was not willing to be around people. To the point she wouldn't show you support for days. If you had asked,  I have the feeling she would have said you tried to pressure her. Accusing you of making her feel guilty.", "NTA\n\nIt is really rude to invite people when you aren't the host. I have a friend who does this and it is so obnoxious.\n\nYou could have asked your parents if she was included, but considering the circumstances it's understandable that you didn't.", "NTA. It is sad to lose a pet.

That\u2019s says it all.", "NTA.  If she's not up to support you at the festival, I don't see why she would be invited for a meal your parents are paying for to celebrate it after.  If she had been at the event, she probably would have been invited.  Maybe a text saying won't be home for dinner would have been nice, but that's about all.", "What kind of audacity is this! NTA", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t up to you to do the inviting. But if your parents asked if you wanted to invite her and you didn\u2019t bother to ask her because you were salty, well, then that would be a different scenario potentially.", "NTA overall but do you actually want her to come bc I kind of feel like your parents would not mind...", "NTA. She was too depressed to come and support you, but not too depressed to go out for a free meal?", "Why a few people she knows at a dinner is a much different crowd than a huge festival of random\npeople you don't know with loud noises all around.", "I think she\u2019s TA not necessarily for her lack of support but for deflecting his event success to focus on her disappointment over something he could not have foreseen.", "Not daily, we eat dinner together 2-3 nights a week.", "You're right. A festival is MUCH EASIER, because you can wander around, barely speak, and leave when you want.", "Yikes. So my line of thinking was she was angry because it's a daily thing. Wow she really couldn't be bothered to show up one day for you but expects to be treated for work she didn't do. And you were kind enough to offer to bring her dinner! Grief affects us all differently but selective socializing is a new one for me!", "NTA - she can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA, but you could've communicated better with her.", "It was an off-the-cuff dinner for folks there and, she was not there. Also, it was your parents hosting the dinner and they set the guest list as it were - it wasn't for you to change it.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA, she wasn\u2019t at the event. She didn\u2019t want to be around people, which is very okay. The people, who she would have had to be around, were at the event. You also were not the one inviting people. It was a last minute thing to go have dinner by your parents, it wasn\u2019t a planned outing. Significant others are not always invited by default especially if they are not there. You offered to bring her something.\n\nAlso, was the event actually close to where she was or would she have had to travel a bit to meet you? Was she ready at that moment to leave the house for dinner?Even if it was close, still NTA. I\u2019m just curious.", "Thank you for bringing up a great point.  Unless Op is a mind reader, how is he supposed to know she\u2019s too upset to attend the festival for moral support, but when it comes to being with people at dinner, she\u2019s all in.", "I came here to say this. Sometimes people are looking for a fight (maybe in her case it\u2019s because she\u2019s hurting and looking for some way to vent those negative feelings). \n\nWhatever the reason, you are NTA - she was not invited by your parents and you were honouring her wishes to not be around people.", "The festival area was about a 13 minute drive from her apartment, and where we went for dinner was 15 minutes the other direction. We live in a pretty small area. I don't know if she was ready to leave the house for dinner, I'm guessing not since she had wanted me to pick up food to go to her house to eat with her.", "Still NTA, I\u2019m also guessing you don\u2019t live together since you said her apartment and she asked you to come over for dinner, which means she was not actually expecting you for dinner like if you lived together. She is overreacting a bit which is probably due to being depressed but not cool to be angry with you over something that happened that was not your plan and didn\u2019t cancel anything you had planned with her.", "Too depressed to be around people? Unless there\u2019s a free meal involved I guess. NTA", "NTA Has it occurred to you that your parents are relieved she wasn't there, out they would have reminded you?  She sounds exhausting. I don't want to go honor and support you, but if it's free food, call me.", "NTA she wasn't up for being around people but was up for dinner? Sounds like just a reason to be mad. Y'all young she will be fine.", "She said she didn't want to be around people, so you carried on accordingly. Clearly, she actually just wanted to pick and choose which event she said yes to. Which is fine, but she doesn't get to now be rude because she changed her mind. NTA", "I'm going with NAH, depending on some factors. How long has she been your gf? A long time? Like more than a year? Has she met your parents several times? If so I think it would have been perfectly appropriate to ask your parents if it was alright to see if gf wanted to join. I know people are saying you weren't the host but these are your parents and it's a dinner for you. I know she said no to the festival but a dinner is different, I would have advocated checking in with her, especially if she expected you see you later.\n\nBut it's also totally understandable that you assumed she wouldn't be up for it, and you offering to bring her food was also very kind. \n\nIf she's a much more short term relationship and hasn't spent much time with your parents then I'd lean a little more towards N T A, she would be kinda overstepping there.", "NTA. She said that she didn\u2019t want to be around people. You took what she said and respected it.", "Fuck That - NTA", "NTA IF it had been you doing the \"treating\" then she might have a leg to stand on but she didn't participate, claims she can't be around people, and wasn't invited.  I'm sorry about her cat, but unless she has some serious underlying mental health issues 2 weeks of social isolation for the loss of her cat is a bit much.", "I\u2019m so confused. She literally told you she didn\u2019t wanna be around any people. Wouldn\u2019t there be a bunch of people at dinner?? Def NTA", "NTA Too distraught to be supportive yet not too upset to be treated to dinner...funny how that works.", "NTA \nIf she\u2019s too upset to be around people to the point she can\u2019t make an appearance for 5 minutes over 3 days, why on Earth would she be upset she wasn\u2019t invited to dinner with everyone who did show up for you? Her being upset would make me look at her all kinds of sideways", "Honestly the amount of posts I read of wives and girlfriends being so high maintenance is starting to give me a headache. \n\nGoodness. \n\nNTA. You didn\u2019t intentionally set out to hurt her. Nor can you read minds. You were actually trying to be considerate of her current situation by not pressuring her to go to the event when actually you should have wanted your partner to be there and supportive of you.", "NTA. I could get that maybe she didn\u2019t want to be around crowds, but being around friends and family would be different and okay - maybe even helpful. Often when I can\u2019t be in public spaces, I still like to be around people I\u2019m close to because it feels safe. It\u2019s not your fault in any way, nor were you an asshole, but it may make a difference to her to say that you\u2019ll make sure to check next time to see if she wants to come. She\u2019s grieving right now - if she\u2019s usually not like this, I can totally see her being a bit irrational and emotional. Good luck!", "NTA she is using the cats death as a crutch to not go out with you.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she wanted the free meal but not to help out at all. I would tell her it was for people who worked at the festival. If she wants the meal then she should have helped.", "You could have asked her anyway , after all she is your girlfriend.  She might have said no , that she wasn't up for it, but the thought counts .", "I\u2019m really not up to seeing people* right now. \n\n* unless they\u2019re bringing me free food. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you respected her wishes, she said she didn't want to be around anyone. But from a girls perspective she's probably upset that she missed out regardless and just wanted to spend some time alone with you (have you two been getting this recently?). And she's grieving, she's going to be set off easier for a while, even if it's not justified", "NTA- while she might be heart broken, this sounds like it would have been a happy escape for a few hours. Pity she missed it, but life happens when you opt out of things. You had a fun, impromptu dinner with friends and family. I can see how she wouldn\u2019t have crossed your mind. She didn\u2019t want to go out earlier.", "NTA!\nShe doesn\u2019t sound like a very good girlfriend!\nYou asked for support and she didn\u2019t give it.\nYeah it\u2019s sad her cat died, but I still think she could have been there to support you.\n\nShe specifically said she didn\u2019t want to be around people so why would you invite her!", "NTA. But it also sounds like she feeling better. It was your parents\u2019 invite and hosted it. I thought it was generous of you to pick something up for her.", "NTA your parents were inviting as hosts to an occasion were the invited people took part in. She wasn't there so there is no reason to invite her.", "You are NTA. She wasn\u2019t invited because she wasn\u2019t there. It\u2019s not a hard concept to grasp. This is coming off very entitled. Like she only wants to be there if she\u2019s gaining something in return, in this case, the food.", "NTA\n\nFirst off its not your place to invite *anyone* to a dinner your parents are hosting.\n\nSecond, the audacity of your girlfriend to think she gets an auto-invite to *every peripheral event in your life* by default! My gosh!\nRomantic stuff, where you need a \"date\"? Yes, its her. Casual social stuff, sure, ok. But everything, everytime? She wasn't a part of this! This wasn't romantic or social. This was a specific event related to an event she hadn't attended.", "NTA. When my cat died it was the most horrible time ever and I was so totally drowning in grief I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to go to a restaurant and make nice with people.

NTA", "Don\u2019t fall for this manipulation OP, you did nothing wrong. You were there for her when her cat died and I understand the bad timing she wasn\u2019t there for you when she had 3 days to.

She owes you an apology for cussing you out.", "NTA, damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.", "NTA. She sounds entitled from what you say. She can\u2019t manage to be supportive and help you out and be around people but can suddenly be ok with being around people if it involves being invited to dinner. Naw dawg. Sounds like a straight up biatch.", "She should have supported you at least for an hour one of the 3 days. Now she\u2019s up for being around people and wanted to go to dinner?

She failed to support you and then expected to basically be supported.", "NTA. She said she didn't want to be around people. You listened to her.  She is just mad because she wanted to go to dinner. She cannot have it both ways. \n\nPay attention to this type of behavior.", "NTA", "NTA.  your parents were the hosts and invited people they had seen. It was Very reasonable for you to assume that if your girlfriend was not up to being around a lot of people, she would not enjoy going out to dinner with a group.", "NTA.

She wasn't there.  Did you parents say you should invite your GF?\n\nIt sounds like she wasn't invited.  In fact, I may have been awkward for her to be there, as she wasn't at the festival.  I can't tell.  You would know better than I.\n\nNTA", "NTA you don\u2019t get to invite anyone to a dinner your parents are hosting because it\u2019s rude.

She\u2019s being selfish and entitled.", "No, NTAH.", "NTA. You did invite her along... to the festival. She wouldn't make time for you and your speech and inturn missed out on the generous meal with your friends and family who did. Wow. NTA!", "NTA - she both wanted space and didn\u2019t want space. You\u2019re not a mind reader.\n\nAlso, she is making everything about her. You had something you asked for moral support for and she couldn\u2019t be there two weeks after your cat passed away? And then instead of congratulating you on a success - turns it into you not inviting her?\n\nCongrats on crushing it. Glad you have awesome people in your life to support you. I\u2019d start slightly paying attention to whether or not she falls in that category. \n\nNo need to decide right now, but I\u2019d keep an eye out", "NTA, \n\nI'm sorry but if she couldn't support you for one day, 2 WEEKS after her cat passed away, that's not right. You had the right thought she didn't want to be around people so why invite her to a dinner with a large group. When she messaged you about food you never said get your own you offered away to organise her food. Plus it's kind of rude to ask to add people to the list I know it's your girlfriend but it's also a large group of people. A very polite gesture Of your parents for the people who came out to support you", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t plan the dinner, she told you she didn\u2019t want to be around people, and it always a celebration/gift for you. Not to mention, how is she mad at you for eating after a long several days?\n\nI\u2019d ask why she is upset. \u201cNot being invited to dinner\u201d doesn\u2019t feel like enough. Is this something that\u2019s happened before? Has she been wanting to spend more time with your family? Was the restaurant a special place? I don\u2019t understand.", ">She didn't make it any of the three days and said she just wasn't up to being around a lot of people still\n\nHer words. She can't pretend she didn't say this and turn it around on you and say you're the AH. Offering to bring her food was kind. NTA.", "NTA. If she can\u2019t suck up her depression to support you during your actual event, I don\u2019t see why she can suck it up now that a restaurant, of all places, is on the table. And I say this as someone with enough depression to prevent me from doing things. It is unreasonable for her to expect an invitation when she already turned down participating in the day, even if she\u2019s unhappy with herself for already having turned down the invitation.", "If you had reached out to her ahead of time and let her know your parents invited you out for dinner and you wouldn\u2019t be coming over, do you think she still would have been upset? I wonder if she just isn\u2019t feeling upset because she didn\u2019t know where you were and was expecting you to come over. Seems like she\u2019s pretty emotionally reliant on you right now. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong so you don\u2019t have to apologize to her. But if you want to smooth things over with her then you should just acknowledge her feelings and continue to offer your support of her like you have been doing. Maybe invite her out to dinner with just the two of you for as soon as she feels up for it. She probably just wants some positive emotions and distraction to latch onto.", "I think it might have more to do with not being asked, then actually going out to dinner. He mentioned her calling him about getting dinner and eating it at her place. So that means she was clueless about his whereabouts. So to hear he was out to dinner it probably stung a bit learning where he was. Maybe she felt a bit forgotten", "I thought this too. I love my dogs so much but I could absolutely pull it together to be there for my husband, especially after two weeks.", "Even so, he did not have the right to invite her since he was not the one who paid for dinner but his parents, I consider it rude to invite a person to something that you are not paying for", "We've been together a little more than 10 months. She's met my parents before, and my parents have invited her to some outings but not all of them. They didn't invite either of my brothers and they're local as well they kept it strictly to people who showed up for the festival. We didn't have any plans to meet up later in the evening or else I would've told my parents that that evening wouldn't have worked.", ">It would have cost him nothing to ask\n\nShe told him explicitly she was not up to being around people. So much so that she was unable to support OP on any of the three festival days.\n\nIf he had asked her and she reacted the way she might just as likely react, she'll get mad and ask, \"I already said I'm not ready to go out. Stop pressuring me just because it's your precious parents' dinner!\" Then he'll be blamed anyway.", "You can\u2019t mope around for weeks and not be a supportive girlfriend for a big event and then get catered to. She wasn\u2019t invited because she didn\u2019t show up for him. \n\n\nI understand she\u2019s grieving, but the world doesn\u2019t stop for our pets, that\u2019s just a fact.", "Forgotten? That would be ridiculous on her part. She was invited to go out to be part of the support and she declined. Citing she didn\u2019t want to be around people.\n\nThat \u201ccongratulations dinner\u201d is part of support, which she declined to be a part of.\n\nThat dinner is taking place at a restaurant with people, which she also declined to be around.\n\nShe already turned down the dinner without even knowing about the dinner. Even if she was invited, after 3 days of non-support, showing up to the dinner is a bit like writing your name down on a card for a gift you had no part in giving.\n\nGF would only be forgotten if OP ignored her wishes and actually sent an invitation, because she already made it crystal clear she didn\u2019t want any part of it. Until she found out there was food involved. It\u2019s just selfish.", "Or just for getting invited. She might still have declined but getting invited while you're feeling down can make a difference.\n\nI think NAH. It makes sense that OP didn't invite her, especially since she said she couldn't be around people and she wasn't part of the group. It also makes sense that the girlfriend wants to know she is being thought of even when she can't make it.", "It's okay to feel a little left out in this situation but ultimately it's up to the GF to be able to reflect on the situation even a tiny bit and understand she put herself in this position. Feeling a little left out initially is fine, getting mad and continuing to stay mad at OP makes her an asshole."]}
