{"id": 25550, "submission_id": "161uz53", "title": "AITA for deadnaming my girlfriend?", "selftext": "My (24f) gf (25f) have been together since our first year of college. She recently came out as trans to me (pronouns are now she/her) and it's been quite the journey since then. Obviously mostly for her, but it's also made me think about myself as well because I used to identify as straight and have now realized that my sexuality is a lot more fluid than I thought.\n\nAnyway, first step was that she tried out some of my clothes and makeup. But her style is very different so I took her shopping and we found some stuff she likes. When she came out to me, she mentioned wanting a different name but she hadn't settled on which one yet. I told her she could let me know when she found a name she liked and then I'll pay for her to have it officially changed if that's something she wanted. Well, like 10 days ago she told me she found a name she loved and ever since then I've been calling her by that name. (The first few days it took some getting used to and it was hard not to automatically say the name I've been calling her by for years but I managed and I really love calling her that now, it's a pretty name that suits her well).\n\nUntil yesterday morning, that is. I like sleeping in but she's an early riser so sometimes she'll wake me up by tickling me, which she did this morning. I wasn't fully awake yet and I accidentally said ''ugh, \\[deadname\\], can you please stop''. After a few sec I realized what I just did and I immediately apologized. She was very upset being called by her old name, which I did understand. But then later in the day (after i apologized another few times) she wouldn't talk to me at first and then later when we did speak, she called me super unsupportive and can't believe I would disrespect her by calling her that name. I said she was overreacting because I've been nothing but supportive to her and that it was an honest mistake that I made because I was still half asleep. That made her angrier.\n\nI slipped up, I know I did. But it hurt my feelings that she would call me unsupportive when I immediately accepted her when she came out, made sure she knew I loved her, tried out new clothes with her the next day, and have been reading articles from both people who are transgender or are family/friends of someone who is to educate myself more. It looks like she'll be mad at me a while longer but I just feel like this amount of anger is not warranted. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your sweet and supportive comments! I will give her some time and then I'll go see if she wants to talk about itand explain my side of things like some of you suggested. Most comments are very kind and I appreciate them but the first transphobic ones have started to trickle in so let me just warn you: THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR TRANSPHOBIA (and no place should be obviously).

Unless she figures out that and apologises for making you walk on eggshells and accusing you of very untrue things, she's an AH.", "NTA. Shit happens. I've literally deadnamed myself a few times lol", "NTA.\nYou've been together for years and were used to call her with her \"deadname\", so it can be difficult to not to use it after only 10 days of her changing it.\nFrom your post you have been supportive from the start and did everything you could to be by her side and make her happy, so you dont deserve this treatment.\nSo, try talking to her again and let her understand that it wasnt only her life that changed and she also need to support and respect you. It's clear that you love her, but you dont have to become a doormat to accomodate her life while negletting your feelings. Respect should go both ways and you did say sorry enough. \nIf she can't see all the things you did for her, she's the one in the wrong.\nGood luck OP!", "NTA: You've been extremely, actively supportive in conistent meaningful ways. You made a mistake\u2014a typical, unsurprising one! You apologized? When she's ready, she can accept the apology. (She's allowed to still be mad! But you're not an asshole.)", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't deadname her because you wanted to hurt her, you did it automatically because that's the name you've been used to. You acknowledged your mistake, apologized and you're also extremely supportive of her, so where's the asshole in that?\n\nThese things take some time, and while you're not the asshole you can try and understand that it's a very sensitive topic for her and she's obviously going through a lot right now, so let her be mad until she feels ready to talk it through and really see where you're coming from. Neither of you is an asshole, you're just living through some changes and everything will settle as long as you are loving, caring and communicate everything.", "As this is all very recent i'm going with NTA. It will take a while (only 10 days!) to get used to the new name and things like this might happen again, and your girlfriend should expect it. especially because calling her by her dead name was not driven by anger or revenge feelings, it was an honest mistake, and you do seem to be very supportive of her (ofc merely based on what you told in this post). Good luck with everything!", "NTA but it sounds like a deeper problem for her. I hope she is in therapy supporting her. Maybe couples therapy would be good as well to help adjust to all the changes.", "NTA you\u2019re going above and beyond, but all change takes time", "NTA.  Give it time.  It wasn't on purpose. There was no disrespect intended.", "NTA. You've been putting in a massive amount of effort and time to be supportive, and made one mistake that you apologised for.", "NTA. This is a tough situation for both of you, but it sounds like you are being really supportive! It will take some time. My partner transitioned a few years ago (like a month before the pandemic, of all times!) and it took me a while to get used to using her new name and pronouns, but she understood when i slipped up because I had known her for so long by a different name. I actually practiced by talking to our cat a lot about her when she wasn't around to get used to using the new name. It sounds insane but it helped. If she is on hormones right now it is also probably exacerbating her emotional reaction so try not to take it too personally. Just give her some time and space to calm down. My partner was an absolute emotional mess for quite a while in the beginning while adjusting to hormones. It's hard for her but she needs to understand how hard this is for you too. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of support out there for the partners of people who are transitioning, but you're welcome to send me a message if you need to chat. Just keep doing your best to support her and hopefully she will see how hard you're trying. A gender transition can put a huge strain on a relationship. I assume she's in therapy, perhaps if she discusses it with her therapist it may help her get some perspective.", "Oh this is definitely gonna be a super chill comment section that will in no way be full of transphobia and eventually get the funny \ud83d\udd12 award.\n\nAnyway, OP, it sounds like you\u2019re trying to be supportive and doing pretty well, but she\u2019s in a very emotional state and is probably worried that the people she loves will leave her, or be unsupportive, which is a thing that happens to almost all of us. And being super emotional is common early in transition. Speaking from experience, it\u2019s a very strange time lol \n\nBut no, if the situation is exactly as you\u2019ve presented it, you did nothing wrong but make a mistake, and I hope she\u2019s able to realize that soon and forgive you, because partners who will support us through transition and love us for who we are are incredibly rare. Maybe give her a day or two to cool off.\n\nNTA", "NTA - It was a literal accident with no disrespect or hurt intended. You didn\u2019t mean to and you are trying really hard to support her. \n10 days is not a large amount of time, you and other people are going to do this for a while. \n\nHer feelings are understandable, that\u2019s ok. Each of you can learn and move on. \n\nGood luck to you both. Sounds like you are on the right path. You sound wonderfully supportive and that is nice. Accidents happen.", "NTA Her deadname is the name you have used for the entirety of the relationship. It\u2019s normal and natural for that name to automatically be used. It takes time to get used to a totally different name. \n\nYour girlfriend doesn\u2019t realise how lucky she is to have someone so supportive.", "NTA, your gf needs be more patient with people getting used to her new name.", "NTA - honestly I don't think it's fair to hold anyone accountable for what they say when they're half asleep... accidentally calling someone the dog's name is excusable when being woken up in a pestering/pet-like way (as an example). Hell, my partner can try all he might to talk about his plans for the day when I'm still half asleep, but if he expects me to have any recollection of it whatsoever, he'd be sorely mistaken... which is why he doesn't do that anymore!", "NTA, this is actual nonsense.\n\nWhy is victim mentality so often used as a replacement for personality? It's getting so damn old", "NTA. But if she is going to react this way when you BOTH are trying to readjust to the new norm than you both might need to rethink the relationship. She needs to give you just as much time, support, and understanding as you have been giving her. \n\nShe is over reacting to a simple mistake that anyone (more will make this same mistake) could have easily made.", "NTA. You didn't do it intentionally and you immediately apologized upon realizing you had done it. She needs to understand it can be difficult to change things perfectly immediately. My offspring changed their pronouns a few months ago. I've been calling them by specific pronouns for 20 years. It is freaking HARD. I do my very best. They know I support them and love them. But my brain is trained one way and I'm working so hard to change it. I'm really happy they don't get angry when I slip. I can't imagine how hard that would be.", "NTA. You get what you get when you interrupt someone's sleep. You've been supportive of her. There was no malice here. If she wants to decrease the likelihood of this happening again, she should let you fully wake and ask for consent.", "NTA, but you'll get a lot of toxic BS on this sub around trans issues. You might want to go to the sub for partners of trans people for better advice.\n\nI'm guessing she might be taking hormones, which mess with emotional regulation. I'm also guessing that you not supporting or accepting her was one of her biggest fears about coming out, and that she might still be scared that you're going to eventually reject her.\n\nShe overreacted and it's understandable that you feel hurt and unappreciated. But unwarranted or exaggerated anger usually covers up a more difficult emotion such as fear, or guilt, or shame.\n\nWhat she probably heard when you deadnamed her was \"You don't see the real me/you don't really care about me\". This was probably exacerbated by the situation - you were half asleep, making it clear that you're having to make a conscious effort to remember who she is right now, which is logical and completely normal but perhaps painful for her to see. To her, she's just taken off a mask she's been wearing all her life.\n\nGiven that you clearly do support her and have supported her in obvious ways, it's unlikely she meant it when she said \"you don't support me\". So the real question is what's the message behind that communication? I suspect it's \"I'm scared that you deadnaming me means you don't see the real me. I'm scared you're going to leave.\"\n\nIt's ok, healthy and reasonable for you to advocate for what you need - things like acceptance from her that you will likely deadname her again, agreement on how to go through that together next time, etc. But if you want the relationship to last you also need to talk about where the anger came from. I hope when she calms down she's able to do that.", "NTA. It's not like she was thinking of you when she decided she was a girl. Get out now.", "I wouldn't say YTA for dead naming her when half asleep, that was probably just an unfortunate slip of the tongue, maybe a slight asshole for telling her she was overreacting though.", "ESH. You for deadnaming her, her for this:\n\n> But then later in the day (after i apologized another few times) she wouldn't talk to me at first and then later when we did speak, she called me super unsupportive and can't believe I would disrespect her by calling her that name.\n\nYou apologized **several** times and she's still pissed, she's been ok with that name but all of a sudden she gets mad as hell for you calling her that? Not saying that you are right, but she sure is overreacting a little bit.", "now she is a she", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
