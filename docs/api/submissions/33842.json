His wife is also a friend of mine from college, and she lost her job right before her maternity leave was going to kick in and she lost her health insurance because of it.

No big deal, I thought. \n\nChristmas I spent at home with my partner watching movies because we hadn\u2019t been invited to any holiday events or anything (which we were fine with).\n\nToday I get a text from my partner\u2019s SIL (40F) asking why I hadn\u2019t swung by to drop off her kid\u2019s (1F) gift. I had explained that I hadn\u2019t had the funds this year, that I only got gifts for my partner and godkids. She blew up and said I was cruel.

On the other hand, maybe I could have gotten her something small like my partner said. AITA?\n\nETA: My partner DID get something for his niece and he put it as being from both of us. He has a difficult time dealing with any conflict due to childhood trauma. Regardless, I already seriously talked with him about why I don\u2019t think I should be responsible for getting his niece a ***second*** gift.
