I saw your comment saying your teeth were in bad shape to begin with due to you neglecting them. Imo, this is relevant information that should have been included in the post. For this reason, I think you should accept that your habits led to your teeth being in such bad condition that a child could knock them out and you should take some responsibility here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for your brother to pay for the entire cost. \n\nThat said, his child is his responsibility and while it\u2019s not his fault this happened, he should also take on some responsibility for the cost. \n\nTo me, I think splitting the price of the implants is fair.", "So, you're saying that a small child hit you hard enough to damage your teeth? There has to be more to this story, unless this was Muhammad Ali's granddaughter.", "YTA here after seeing your comments about you neglecting your teeth.  You say they were already in poor shape and could be easily damaged.  No idea how old this niece was, but if you have to hold her down I'm assuming toddler at best.\n\nSo your teeth already had severe damage and she ends up breaking them,  she is in no way responsible for the decades of previous damage done to your teeth that led to that particular moment. \n\n If Bob beats the crap out of his nice porsche, then you rear-ended him at 5 miles per hour and shattered the drive train he cracked earlier, are you buying him a brand new porsche?", "Wtf did she hit you with?", "Depending on a number of variables his homeowners/renters insurance might cover it.", "YTA. Either this whole story is  made up or OP\u2019s teeth were already bad in which case they shouldn\u2019t expect the whole payment.", "INFO: do you lead a particular type of lifestyle that would cause your teeth to break off so easily?", "YTA, there is no way a child would have been able to break healthy teeth and the incident was not your brother's fault. It was an accident and, although it would be fair for your brother to contribute, the full cost is not his responsibility.", "ESH -   Not your brothers fault but he should offer at least a couple of bucks regardless of how struggling he is.    it happened and even if the kid was a stranger and you took this to court you would likely be laughed out of the courtroom.    So you basically have to decide if you even want a relationship with your brother and his kid or do you want a tooth to be the catalyst for not having one.", "NAH.  It's not your brother's fault this happened - you don't give the kid's age, but sounds like a toddler and as you just learned they can be unpredictable.  Handle them at your own risk.\n\nThat's a hefty bill, and if your brother was in a position to help with it I'd be on board with asking, but if he's barely making ends meet, well, you can't squeeze water out of a stone you know?", "NTA. Your brother should absolutely be offering to help pay for the damage caused by his child. Legal responsibility depends on where you live. Where I am located there has to be \u201cwillful or malicious\u201d intent for a parent to be responsible and there are limits to how much a parent can\u2019t be held responsible for ($5k). Generally speaking parents of minors are considered jointly liable for damages.", "I'm not gonna lie, I would be extremely curious how a little girl could have that force to break your teeth, lol.\n\nBut, if you held her right and she didn't hurt you because of something you could have avoided, then NTA. I get it, every parent struggles with a lot of money issues, but he has to be responsible and offer you a monthly payment or something that will work for the both of you. Because, what if this had happened to someone who isn't related? He would have gotten to pay either way.\n\nBut I would like for you to describe how she managed to do it :))", "The root of the tooth is under the gum, there\u2019s no need to get implants. Even if the whole visible part of the tooth is broken you should be fine with posts and crowns. I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d go right to implants. Either you\u2019re lying or your dentist is screwing you.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother should discipline his kid to learn to behave, and you need to keep yourself afloat.

If not you may not have any recourse except to not help next time.", "NTA.\n\nNo, you're not. Remember this: if you weren't related, you'd most likely sue him to cover the costs. His kid is his liability.\n\nHe sucks for being fine with sticking you with almost $9k of dental bills + the pain and time. \n\nAsk your mom for the funds then if she thinks it's so petty. If she won't pay then, hm, maybe not so petty.", "Question;  Has your brother offered to pay at least some of the costs you incurred?  Obviously this is all an unfortunate incident and it would be painful for the accident of a toddler to affect your family dynamic.\n\nHaving said that you did suffer legitimately and the least he and your mom can do is to see if some compromise can be worked out given that his daughter did injure you (albeit accidentally).\n \nOverall, NTA or a soft ESH.", "YTA. Unless this kid hit you on purpose, you can't control this kind of thing. It was a true accident and neither you nor your brother are at fault. However, you've said in your comments that you had been neglecting your teeth prior to this and that they were \"weak\", so it's not unreasonable to assume the work might not have been so extensive if you had been taking better care of them.

You can't get blood from a stone and pushing the matter when he's not at fault will only end up damaging you relationship.", "Sorry on phone meant niece not nephew.

Accidents happen. Your brother apologized. It would be nice if he contributed to your dental work, but it is likely it will take him a *long, long* time.

The other one has executive dysfunction like whoa - but honestly, my teeth are pretty okay despite that.

Basic cleanings and X-rays. Anything over 1200 a year and you\u2019ll need\nTo pay for it yourself. Implants are rarely covered. They may cover a removable partial.

I also get it she is a kid, it is no way hee fault either. Kids will be kids.

Either way as I said I agree it is what it is.", "Here is the difference. \n\nMy teeth were weak but not weak to the point where they were lose or rotten to the core. My bone is healthy and as my dentist said my teeth are just weaker then the normal person but in terms of everyday normal usage my teeth will.hold up just fine if I care for them moving forward. Which is true 10 years without issue. \n\nSo to correct your analogy. Say you had a car that you have had for many years and it got to the point where you were warned if you don't start taking care of it you will need a new car. So you start caring for it go 10 years without issues and have been told outside of outside trauma your car will be fine. \n\nNow after 10 years I hit your car and I was the one at fault yes I would cover the damages. The condition of the car is moot it was running prior to me hitting it.  Why would I leave you with a bill for my actions? So I would cover the bill required to repair the damage. \n\nCar example fails cause I do not need an entire set of new teeth, I am asking for him to cover the damage to the teeth caused by my niece.\n\nThat is essentially blaming the victim.", "I was just going off of OP saying it was cosmetic and the above comment suggesting it could be medically necessary bite-wise. But I don\u2019t actually know much other than insurance companies are evil and hate to pay for anything", "Sounds like this would have happened eventually anyway. You can\u2019t neglect your teeth to the point where a small child can knock them out of your head, and then be all surprised and upset that it happened. \n\nYour lack of hygiene and dental care is why your teeth got knocked out. It was also a complete accident and no one was being malicious or negligent. Aside from you, with your dental hygiene, that is."]}
