I saw your comment saying your teeth were in bad shape to begin with due to you neglecting them. Imo, this is relevant information that should have been included in the post. For this reason, I think you should accept that your habits led to your teeth being in such bad condition that a child could knock them out and you should take some responsibility here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for your brother to pay for the entire cost. \n\nThat said, his child is his responsibility and while it\u2019s not his fault this happened, he should also take on some responsibility for the cost. \n\nTo me, I think splitting the price of the implants is fair.", "So, you're saying that a small child hit you hard enough to damage your teeth? There has to be more to this story, unless this was Muhammad Ali's granddaughter.", "YTA here after seeing your comments about you neglecting your teeth.  You say they were already in poor shape and could be easily damaged.  No idea how old this niece was, but if you have to hold her down I'm assuming toddler at best.\n\nSo your teeth already had severe damage and she ends up breaking them,  she is in no way responsible for the decades of previous damage done to your teeth that led to that particular moment. \n\n If Bob beats the crap out of his nice porsche, then you rear-ended him at 5 miles per hour and shattered the drive train he cracked earlier, are you buying him a brand new porsche?", "Wtf did she hit you with?", "Depending on a number of variables his homeowners/renters insurance might cover it.", "YTA. Either this whole story is  made up or OP\u2019s teeth were already bad in which case they shouldn\u2019t expect the whole payment.", "INFO: do you lead a particular type of lifestyle that would cause your teeth to break off so easily?", "YTA, there is no way a child would have been able to break healthy teeth and the incident was not your brother's fault. It was an accident and, although it would be fair for your brother to contribute, the full cost is not his responsibility.", "ESH -   Not your brothers fault but he should offer at least a couple of bucks regardless of how struggling he is.    it happened and even if the kid was a stranger and you took this to court you would likely be laughed out of the courtroom.    So you basically have to decide if you even want a relationship with your brother and his kid or do you want a tooth to be the catalyst for not having one.", "NAH.  It's not your brother's fault this happened - you don't give the kid's age, but sounds like a toddler and as you just learned they can be unpredictable.  Handle them at your own risk.\n\nThat's a hefty bill, and if your brother was in a position to help with it I'd be on board with asking, but if he's barely making ends meet, well, you can't squeeze water out of a stone you know?", "NTA. Your brother should absolutely be offering to help pay for the damage caused by his child. Legal responsibility depends on where you live. Where I am located there has to be \u201cwillful or malicious\u201d intent for a parent to be responsible and there are limits to how much a parent can\u2019t be held responsible for ($5k). Generally speaking parents of minors are considered jointly liable for damages.", "I'm not gonna lie, I would be extremely curious how a little girl could have that force to break your teeth, lol.\n\nBut, if you held her right and she didn't hurt you because of something you could have avoided, then NTA. I get it, every parent struggles with a lot of money issues, but he has to be responsible and offer you a monthly payment or something that will work for the both of you.

He would have gotten to pay either way.\n\nBut I would like for you to describe how she managed to do it :))", "The root of the tooth is under the gum, there\u2019s no need to get implants.

His kid is his liability.\n\nHe sucks for being fine with sticking you with almost $9k of dental bills + the pain and time. \n\nAsk your mom for the funds then if she thinks it's so petty. If she won't pay then, hm, maybe not so petty.", "Question;  Has your brother offered to pay at least some of the costs you incurred?  Obviously this is all an unfortunate incident and it would be painful for the accident of a toddler to affect your family dynamic.\n\nHaving said that you did suffer legitimately and the least he and your mom can do is to see if some compromise can be worked out given that his daughter did injure you (albeit accidentally).\n \nOverall, NTA or a soft ESH.", "YTA. Unless this kid hit you on purpose, you can't control this kind of thing. It was a true accident and neither you nor your brother are at fault.

Teeth are weird.", "According to the OP they where weaker than normal but at no risk of falling out. They have gone 10 years without issue so my guess they were a lazy kid and wised up as they got older say around HS or something. \n\nDoes not seem like they were brittle or rottened out. If that was the case they probably would have done work on them over the last 10 years.", "Based off replies they have been taking better care of their teeth. Sadly, old damage does not just go away. Not much OP could have done prior to this. All they could have done was move forward with better care which it seems like they did. \n\nDamage was done blaming them for behavior as a kid is kind of messed up. Also we don't know genetics could play a role. Short roots could be at play.", "Pretty sure elsewhere they stated that they did not expect them to pay it in full. That said OP cannot force their brother to pay. It is a lost cause.  \n\nIf they OP can afford to charge this amount they are not exactly struggling as much. Feel for the OP tbh I would do it for free if they lived near me.", "Flippers are not exactly comfortable. They are glorified retainers, and normally are used as temporary fixes while someone waits on their implants.", "Where do the OP say they were decayed? The most they said was the enamel was worn, and they had weaker then normal teeth. \n\nWhere do you get decay from?", "US medical insurance company has brainwashed us to the point we have people throwing their talking points in reddit.", "I have perfectly fine teeth and a two year old has cracked my tooth to the point where i needed a crown. \n\nDirect force to your teeth especially a hit from below can cause enough damage to damage the root of your tooth in a normal. Someone with weaker teeth just means they are at a greater risk.", "Lol what we insurance companies now if someone's medical treatment is covered wether or not they had a preexisting condition? \n\nSure this could have happened anytime. Thing is it didn't happen anytime. it happened when the OP's niece ram her head into OP mouth. \n\nKid = parents responsibility.", "Reading the posts OP said they were cracked to the root. So it probably would be possible to save the tooth but not a 100%. Which makes sense for the implant why pay for a root canal that might fail and have to be redo. \n\nAlso genetics could be at play he could have shorter roots. So coupled with the weaker teeth OP has higher chances of getting seriously harmed by an outside force like a hit.", "The root of the tooth is under the gum, there\u2019s no need to get implants. Even if the whole visible part of the tooth is broken you should be fine with posts and crowns.", "According to people here his mom had a glass jaw. Totally her fault.", "> just to have teeth like he did before\u2026\n\n> implants are the most logical choice \n\nHaha what? He had rotting teeth before, implants are a *huge* upgrade.", "Not a dentists but I shattered my front four teeth and have been dealing with posts, crowns, and implants long enough to know the one talking out their ass is you.", "He said biting a bone could've caused his teeth to break as well, so if his teeth are that fragile, it would make sense getting kicked in the teeth would knock them out too and it would be OPs lack of care thats to blame.", "Damn you MIL and your frail, frail jaw!!!", "Where does it state OP had rotting teeth? You do know weak teeth does not mean rotten teeth right?\n\nThey cannot put his old teeth in, but implants would get him to a point where they would function like his old teeth.", "Yeah I guess working as a dental hygienist for 15 years is me talking out of my ass lol", "7.5k for two teeth is cheap. One implant can go for 5k", "I remember the pure embarrassment I felt as a 7yo after I jumped up while hugging my nanny and broke one of her teeth with my skull. My head didn\u2019t even hurt", "Based.", "It depends, bridges put a lot of strain on the anchoring teeth.", "Good, now I know what dentist office to avoid.", "My dentist when giving me the options for a tooth I might have to pull. As the other person who replied stated, he probably meant just the false tooth part instead of the metal portion.\n\nAlso, anyone who comes across this thread and wants to jump in and say xy or z about how horrible my dentist is and he needs his license revoked etc. will immediately get blocked. I had a wave of people do that when I shared my immunotherapy experience and I have 0 energy for it \ud83d\ude02", "Partial denture is also an option and probably cheaper than both. Those crazy pageant moms use them for their kids when their baby teeth fall out", "It does depend. If the OP could show documentation that the current condition of their teeth is enough to function around normal use, and that outside of something out the norm happening they would be fine. They can make the argument the brother should be responsible for the damages, and may be required to get their teeth to the same level of functionality. \n\nIf their teeth cannot support a bridge then implants would be the only way to get the OP's teeth to the functional status they were piror to the damage.", "Interesting! As I said I believe you, was just curious because I had never heard that before. But there will of course be different options available depending on the reason for the implant, and a person\u2019s overall health status etc. \n\nFunny enough, I have a cap on a peg tooth that was supposed to be temporary and is now 14 years old with no signs of disengagement from the peg tooth. Im missing one top lateral incisor, and only got half of the other hence the implant and cap. The cap was intended to last 2-3 years, but my dentist just did a really bitchin job with the temp.", "True, personally I would not recommend anyone to get partial dentures. They are cheaper upfront but it is a bandaid. Far easier and cost effective to do it right the first time and call it. Implants when you are younger set quicker are cheaper since they most likley do not require bone grafting. \n\nJust what I would suggest at my practice but I get dental work is not cheap. Just OP if you do a partial please do not do a flipper. Those are 100% meant to be temporary and many dentist like to frame them as good solutions.", "I'm no dentist or dental assistant, but I'm guessing it's more about the condition of the roots that makes the implants a better option for OP. If they were healthy roots then these other options might be viable, but because OP's teeth are already so fragile it kind of makes more sense to start fresh rather than try and work with the roots of weak damaged teeth that will likely just break again if put under any sort of stress? OP has admitted they do not have healthy teeth and I think that that likely plays a big role in all of this...", "Well if we're talking U.S. insurance they probably expect you to suck it up and gum your food, babies do it and survive after all! They find ways to minimize what is actually \"necessary\" so they can get away with covering less and going without teeth won't *kill* you soooo.... Not saying it's right, just saying that's the f*cked up country I live in. Lol.", "Yay for awesome dentists! I miss my dentist from my old town because she had the best deadpan humor. Like she once asked her assistant for a tool nicknamed redneck, then turned to me and said \"don't worry we all know rednecks don't have teeth, especially in this town\" \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nNew guy is cool too I've just only seen him twice lol.", "I had a dentist that made a temporary that lasted for five years, I could not afford the permanent crown at the time.", "That's fair! I think at this point OP should get a quote for the bridge and have the brother pay that at most. They might even be able to go through the brother's renter's/ homeowner's insurance to get the implants covered. 8.5k is a crazy ask for an accident when the break was caused by a self-induced preexisting condition.", "If the bone surrounding the roots is so bad that they\u2019re not salvageable, and OP already admitted that they neglected their hygiene for years. That gives you periodontal disease (disease of the gum and bone surrounding their teeth). In that case, implants aren\u2019t suggested until OP can get their hygiene under control. The bone won\u2019t support implants.", "Yeah definitely, I just said *should* be covered, but it would be a miracle if they actually covered it", "My parents did not knock my teeth. I get it w/e I am the asshole peace.", "That is fair.\n\nThat being said someone with weak teeth can go a lifetime without issues. Normally weak teeth mean they simply have a higher chance to break on things that teeth are not meant to be handling but \"can\" handle if need be. \n\nI have seen many like the OP ignore proper care early on but kill it when they are older. Their teeth may be weaker but they could very well being strong enough to handle day-to-day use. \n\nLet's not pretend getting hit in your month is normal."]}
