Yes if I have to call police/postal service I will. \nIf you don't want a felony charge modify your behavior.", "Yes, she should be charged with a felony for committing a felony!\n\nWitholding mail is no laughing matter, there could have been anything in there, from medicine or something perishable to something OP needed to sell for her business.\n\nShe was not a bit of an asshole. A bit of an asshole would have flipped OP the finger but still got them their mail.", "Spoken to and being rude is different.   \nContext matters, it sounds like OP took out their personal day issues on the concierge, regardless of what they were doing.", "Because it's YTA with no explanation.", "Some people take joy in their incompetence and ignorance. She knows what she is doing. She is making a power play. I live in a similar situation. If a concierge told me that they refused to get my packages, I would be in the managers office so fast. And I never complain. NTA, continue to behave as you are: a person who pays a bit more for the service of safe and timely package-gettin'.", "I worked at a small local video shop where most of our business came from the anime and porn section, so my boss was usually pretty chill. But if someone complained that we'd just ignored him, then he wouldn't have been very happy. But it was a cool store, and he stayed open as long as he at least broke even. He lasted longer than Blockbuster though!", "I bet she's a relative of the manager", "She did not steal a package.", "Not surprised to see people on here go for the absolute nuclear option. Just get in touch with someone else in the building, get her in trouble. You don't need to ruin someone's life over this kind of thing.  \n\nSo many of you play out the worst play-by-play of a scenario in your head. \"She could have needed that package for her life saving medicine.\" \"She might have gone bankrupt from not being able to sell an item for her business.\" If that were the case, then I would have to think OP would be a bit more adamant in the situation. You think the minimum wage desk worker is going to be like, \"I'd rather you die than get the package?\"", "That's beyond rude.   \nSnapping your fingers at a waiter is rude even if they are being slow. Saying move your lazy ass is worse but also rude. there are degrees. You'd be an ass hole in both situations, just a bigger one in the latter.", "I\u2019d describe the concierges behaviour as rude and they were met with the same energy. But what\u2019s worse than that is she will ruin phone use and a chill job for the next employee. There is always one asshole that takes it too far and ruins it for everyone.", "Any proof? Or are you arrogant enough to just state something as if it's a fact?", "Problem with your reasoning is that if we let this one fly, the chances increase that she will one day do this to someone who will have those serious consequences. And OP doesn't have an obligation *and neither a right* to be a hardass about someone else not doing their job. Same ad they do not have any obligation to disclose what is and what is not inside their private mail. I agree with you that they should get through building management first though.", "And completely not one in the original scenario", "true, but how does the old saying go, two assholes don't make a right! or something like that.", "OP never claimed she stole a package. You've invented something in your head to get mad at.", "Do you have any proof that she stole the package? OP made no claims to that", "I think the saying you\u2019re looking for is fuck around and find out.", "She refused to get packages after. So she isn\u2019t even doing her job at either. Saying come on, alright let\u2019s go isn\u2019t berating or offensive. Your lack of work ethic will have you struggling in life if you truly believe what you\u2019re saying.", "that's a quick way of getting your packages fucked with though", "My lack of work ethic brings me in plenty of money, and my patients don't mind me being effective as opposed to worrying about eye contact. Considering I have to spend a considerable amount of time on a computer to see their records, I'll admit I'm probably somewhat biased to it not being a big deal to have a screen, for whatever reason.\n\nShe refused to get his package after he was rude. That's pretty standard, being able to deny service.\n\nMy assumption is he was rude. They didn't provide any actual timeframe on the person moving to get their package. Was it 20 seconds? Was it 5 minutes? An answer to that would definitely change my opinion if she had ignored OP for minutes. That's probably the root of our differing opinions on OPs statement. I would, personally, never say \"come on, let's go\" or similar. I had a patient be rude two weeks ago with \"let's keep it moving, do you not read the chart\" when I was asking something and that appointment immediately stopped. On its face, that question is pretty matter-of-fact, but the delivery is what matters. IMPE everyone who thinks they're just being matter of fact has just been being rude and doesn't want to admit to that.", "committing a crime by messing with someone's mail (which would easily be traced back to you as well...) just because someone slightly annoyed you doesn't really seem like the best plan though", "And that\u2019s a great way to lose a job where you get to watch tv on your phone all day. What do you not understand about this transaction?", ">That's pretty standard, being able to deny service.\n\nYou can't refuse to give people their mail, that could end up killing someone or landing them in hospital...", "You work on a computer so eye contact wouldn\u2019t be important I agree. But you don\u2019t sit there and blatantly ignore someone watching television do you? That\u2019s what op is saying this person consistently does and was doing when he asked for the mail. Op isn\u2019t an asshole for not wanting to wait on someone to finish up their YouTube video because they deem his time not important while they are supposed to be working. It\u2019s unprofessional, rude and disrespectful to act the way he\u2019s describing their actions.", "LMFAO\n\nThis comment perfectly encapsulates just how entitled you are. Calling them \u201c*my* patients\u201d only to reveal you\u2019re just an office worker\u2026 yeah the workers in a doctors office are the worst for this shit.", "I never said I was an office worker. Lol. Believe it or not, doctors need to look at patient records too \ud83e\udd23"]}
