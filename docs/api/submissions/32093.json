Youre nta. She is there for a reason and if she is not completing her job as shes meant to its a problem. It is fine to take it easy at work. But there is definitely moments when you have to pay attention and give your best customer service personality. \nPeople in the comments saying yta for expecting average service (the bare minimum) are people who think customer service should go out the window.", "NTA. She's slacking off on the job. If she does it again, I wouldn't interact, but file a complaint.", "NTA. She has one job that she's getting paid for and it's not to watch shows. She needs to get people's packages promptly and not make them wait for no reason. \n\nI can understand your frustration after countless times of this. But I would have complained to the management and/or your landlord by now. The residents are paying her salary.", "Make a formal complaint,  they'll check on her", "NTA it\u2019s her job", "Nta. She's paid to provide a service. \n\nTalk to management about her refusing to get packages for you. Admit you may been brisk with her but her refusal is the part to be dealt with.", "Gonna go with ESH. No problem taking it handy with some entertainment between tasks at your job, but when you're needed for something you should make some kind of effort to provide the service you're hired for, in a professional manner. Remaining glued to your screen while someone is standing there waiting is rude and unprofessional.\n\nHowever that doesn't absolve your asshole behaviour. Snapping at her with your commands is also rude. You're not her authority figure, you don't get to tell her what to do. \n\nIf you expressed your impatience with a question \"Can I get that now please?\" rather than a command, you'd be in the clear.", "Even if her performance is such that a complaint to management would be appropriate, it wasn\u2019t appropriate to talk to her that way.", "I\u2019m thinking your matter of fact voice was anything but. Poor you. Living in an apartment that has a concierge and having to ask for your packages, then wait a few seconds for her to retrieve them must be such a hardship. If her job performance bothers you so much you can speak to her supervisor. I just don\u2019t believe she refused to retrieve your package due to your request as described to us.", "YTA, only because I'm sure your \"matter of fact\" was, instead, \"rude as hell.\" You find a lack of eye contact disrespectful? \ud83e\udd23 \n\nWaiting a few moments won't kill you, and if it bugs you to have to do so, don't pay to live somewhere with a concierge.", "YTA - I don't need the context.", "NAH - This is a tricky one. This was not the best service; completely agree. However, I promise you the concierge is not making nearly enough money to give any more of a damn about their job. In America, the younger generations are \u2018acting their wage\u2019 (as they should be) because they cannot even afford to live. Until companies/corporations start paying folks what they need to meet their basic needs, they are unlikely (and shouldn\u2019t) expend much more than the minimum energy at their jobs. \n\nHowever, you were frustrated, and those feelings are totally valid. You were a bit brash in your response, but given the situation, I will give you a pass. \n\nThe AH here is corporations/management. If they paid the person better, they might be more cordial and thus, you would be more cordial back. \n\nHowever, you and the concierge live within an economy driven by corporations and neither of you are likely to make much of a difference (still try when you can!) In the future, even if frustrated, try having some empathy if you can. It sucks for you both. \n\nAlso, it seems like you might have a bit of an expendable income. It would never hurt to get a 5$ gift card to Starbucks or something and throw it into a card saying \u2018Thank you\u2019 sometime. They might be more responsive the next time you come around. \n\nTo be clear, this shouldn\u2019t be on you but being realistic about all this, it wouldn\u2019t hurt.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I worked in the service industry for over a decade, and some people just suck and deserve to be called out for their shitty attitudes.\n\nOP should also file a complaint with the building manager.", "I agree, especially since this seems to be a repeated thing. I worked in a small loc video shop when I was in college, so I did a lot of studying at the desk when there wasn't anything to do. But if a customer came in I had to be ready to stop what I'm doing and help them. I didn't have a phone that could play videos because that wasn't a thing yet, but how hard is it to just hit pause and help the customer?", "OP was not rude. It's been pointed out to me that on this sub when it's an issue between a woman and a man and the woman is wrong very often the esh gets pulled but it never gets pulled when it's the other way around.\n\nIf that woman was working for me and I saw her behave that way I'd be giving her a permanent vacation.", "I was a concierge (hotel though not residential) for three years and I totally agree with this assessment.

Bossy rudeness to me \"Move your fucking ass you lazy old woman, all the fucking day watching the phone\"", "From the sounds of it, she *was* doing her job. She puts her phone away, gets the package, and hands it to OP. Her job is to give them the package.\n\nShe's taking a second to put it away instead of jumping up with a salute and \"of course sir! Thank you sir!\" Or a \"Would you like me to lick your boots clean sire?\" and OP thinks that's disrespectful.\n\nThe idea that everyone should smile and kiss your ass because you exist is stupid.", "it's the attitude of \"service workers can do no wrong\"", "They aren't paying you to watch TV. I get it. You're watching your show, but when someone is coming into your area, then you put the phone away and do your job. As described in OP's situation.\n\nShe did the fundamental task of her job, but body language matters. No eye contact, dragging your heels away from your phone. If I'm her coworker, then I'm neither surprised or upset if a customer gives you that kind of attitude. If you give bare basic effort and ignore them when they speak to you. Especially when this person pays for you to be there, then they have a right to have sass about it.\n\nThe idea that offering efficient service is \"bootlicking\" just says a lot about your work ethic.", "It always amazes me how \"effecient\" gets conflated with soft skills like smiling, making eye contact, being perky, etc. Effecient and those soft skills have absolutely nothing to do with each other.\n\nI have no idea what the desk setup is in OPs building. If they see someone coming up to the desk, sure, they should pay attention to that person. It's been my experience that residential concierges are tucked away in corners because they're not considered people. \ud83d\ude05 If you have 3 seconds warning someone is there, it's reasonable for them to take a few seconds to put their phone away.\n\nI want efficient services. I care about turnaround time and accuracy, not whether or not someone seems happy to be making minimum wage or close to it. That OP, and clearly you, think the rest of it is mandatory just points to an assumed difference in how we fundamentally treat work. I'm there to do my job, you're clearly there to kiss ass."]}
