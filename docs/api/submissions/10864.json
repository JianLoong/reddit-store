You need to tell your husband why you wouldn\u2019t prefer your child being named after his dad, I\u2019m sure he would understand considering you want the past to be let go.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFind a name both of you can agree on, and drop ALL other names. Go through lists of names until you get TWO yeses.", "NTA. I personally feel like it\u2019s a slap in the face for your husband to insist your child have the same name as your abuser. \n\nI can totally understand not wanting to name your child something that is a negative and brings up uncomfortable feelings. \n\nIf anyone has said that you just hate the name. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I mean I have nothing against the name Carmen. But I was bullied by not one, but 2 different girls named Carmen.\n\nStand your ground. For the first time ever. This is a hill to die on I think.", "ESH. You both are a little dense in not seeing the others viewpoint.", "NTA, naming of a child should always be 2 yes but one no. Meaning you both have to agree and if that can\u2019t happen then it\u2019s not the right name.", "What if you give your son your husband's dad's middle name as his middle name?", "This. Far better to have the story come out in OPs own time, in OPs own version of events.", "yes", "Your husband should accept your veto without the additional information, but it sounds like you'll need to disclose for him to understand.", "What n the hell", ">  I didn\u2019t tell him\n\nToday's the day\n\nOtherwise how can he sympathise or understand your stance on this name?\n\nThis WILL come out sooner or later. Far better it come out under your control.\n\nIf your husband can't control himself, are you sure you should be married to him?", "My stepdad's family kinda does it except they all have different middle names and are only referred to by thier middle names which makes me wonder why they even do it if no one calls them by thier first name.", "My stepcousin got royally screwed over because of this\n\nHe, and my stepbrother, are both named after grandpa, so both Frank Smith. Cousin goes by his middle name-Drew\n\nStepbrother is a convicted felon\n\nSo cousin always ends up getting messed up, because legally they're both Frank Smith born in the same year, same town\n\nHe wants to Homer Simpson SB, and I don't blame him", "NTA. However, there might be a way to still honor his father such as using the same first initial, a completely different name that has the same meaning (example: Edmund and Alexander both can mean \u201cdefender of man\u201d), using a middle name or nickname, or naming the child after something his father loved or something associated with his father (a place, a plant, etc.). I\u2019d suggest coming up with a list of names you like that still honor his father in some way. Since you don\u2019t yet know the gender of the next child you can also come up with a list of names for a girl too. This helps convey that you want to honor his father and want that component included, even if you can\u2019t stomach using one particular name because of the associations.", "Um... It's not his child. It's both of yours. Either find a nickname both of you like, or pick something else. I hope you have a girl", "NTA", "NTA, also it's \"our child\" not \"his child\", I assume you're doing a lot more of the work in this group project", "Isn't the kid going to have his paternal grandfather's surname? Surely that's enough?\n\nYou are not the ahole.", "It sounds like you missed out on getting to use names from your family for the first kid much more than anyone from his side of the family missed out on getting their name recycled. \n\nI think the question you meant to ask is \"am I the asshole for not letting my husband name OUR child after his dad?\" and the answer is no, NTA, both because the name he wants to use means something terrible to you, and because you should get an equal say and equal representation here, or at least equal opportunity. \n\nNames are a single-veto item. If there's one veto, you find something else. Use your veto, my friend.", "NTA. Your husband needs to realize that there are some names that are an absolute \u201cno\u201d based on experience. You should never be pressured to name a kid the same name as your ex.", "NTA - if someone tried to get me to name my kid after my abuser I would do the same thing. The positive memories are his, not yours.", "Truthfully, based on how you respond, YTA. It seems like you care about how you feel about the name. You want him to respect how you feel about the name but clearly don't care how he feels about it. Your compromise was to use your FIL middle name, but he was against it because they have the same middle name. To him, it may not feel like his father would be honored the way your father was. But you really make it seem like you don't care as long as you don't have to use the name you don't like. Tbh, you really need to have an honest conversation with your husband because you're painting him as inconsiderate, but you are also coming off as heartless and acting as if he has no right to feel upset.", "Can you use his Dad\u2019s first name as a middle name?  That way he still has a name from your husband\u2019s father.", "I understand I feel the same way about my biological father.  I can\u2019t stand that name now and even though I know people with that name who are in no way like him it\u2019s still hard.", "I think it's tacky and egotistical, and my family is full of it\ud83d\ude44. I refused. I told them they had a chance to use the names they wanted when they had kids, now it's our turn. My husband tried with the junior nonsense and I said unless I get one too, you're not. He shut up. Kids should have their own names.", "Man I'd probably just change my first name to what people already call me. It's a hassle to change your name but it'll be less of a headache than getting mixed up with a criminal.", "Yeah, he's always considered it, but always thought it would be cruel to grandpa. Now that he's dead, I thonk he's waiting for it to heal a bit, you know?"]}
