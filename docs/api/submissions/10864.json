Without too many details, he wrecked his truck with me in it (still not sure if it was on purpose or not, but it could have been avoided) he sexually assaulted me more than once, and he would manipulate my parents constantly which made me look psychotic and made him look like a saint. \n\nWhen I got pregnant with my daughter, we had been broken up and had not seen eachother for 6 months (got pregnant very early into my new relationship but it\u2019s worked out for me lol) he had people ask me if it was his baby.
