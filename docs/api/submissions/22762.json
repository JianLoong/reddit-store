Because they carry them all over the house, leaving them in our bed, on our chairs,  on our laps.\n\n\nWhen I had a dog, she had toys, but she lived and breathed for her tennis balls. After she passed, I was in the yard, removing a bush to put up  a fence. I found 3 tennis balls she'd left for us to find.  She was a great dog.", "Right? My girl is perfect and deserves all the toys!", "I hear you.  The only \u201dtoy\u201d my dog wants to play with is my kitten.  Or a marrow bone.  The toys the Divine Miss T considered boring are excellent for our new kitty to try to disembowel.", "Same, except I'm pretty sure my dog is too dumb for toys. She just looks at them. I mean, she plays in other ways, loves to chase and be chased by other pets but she has no use for toys.", "This is too cute \ud83e\udd23", "Love it!", "Thank you for paying the dog tax! That is so adorable!", "Lol those dogs lived in the wild not an apartment/house where they can chew/shake/dog/pee on anything their heart desires. Also don\u2019t act like we haven\u2019t bred the wild out out of like every breed. You tried dude. It\u2019s a fact toys are good for their mental health. sister thinks you can spoil a dog with 12 toys you really think she know enough to keep them stimulated/entertained in other really effective ways?", "i should try this.  only one of my dogs really likes toys, but he loves them.  they are just scattered all around the doggy playroom.  he usually loses them (under lowish furniture where he is afraid to go (he is weird) and under the couch) and then finds them later (crying until we get them for him).", "I love doing this , works with cats too! Sometimes I just dump them *all* out for a week and he goes nuts  never gets old", "Yep! \ud83e\udd23", "Oh yes! It is probably the best cat \u201ctoy\u201d I have ever purchased.\n\nThe boy cat gets going fast and then jumps up and GRABS the wheel to yank it down. He also ghostrides - gets going as fast as he can, jumps off, stands a minute, then jumps back on. He has knocked it off the base countless times. I would leave for a short time, come back, and it\u2019s just laying on the floor. He\u2019s gone so fast that he has thrown himself off.  \n\nWhen I take it off the base, my girl cat comes running to stand on it and walk\u2026 down the hallway. She goes forward with no care for what may be in the way. When it stops moving, she keeps trying to make it roll. \n\nIt has been used so much that I had to replace the padding. It took some time to get them active on it again since their scent markers had changed. \n\nThe base was cheap plastic and aluminum. After the fifth time the bearings were replaced and the aluminum started to bend, my partner built a base that uses heavy wood and industrial toolbox wheels.", "Roflmao like \"good sir I will only partake in the finest of T-bones keep that peasant food away from me\"", "Cats are just people who stopped giving a fuck", "Huskies can absolutely be brats.", "Only 50?!?  Why are you depriving her?", "lol that\u2019s different your mom at least gave them to the dog he wasn\u2019t rocking with it and that\u2019s perfectly fine. OPs sister is just terrible like damn not even 1 ?", "Make a doggo wish list for her dog and put it on tik tok. Sit back and watch the gifts roll in.", "Thank you", "My youngest (3 months old) turns everything into a toy. I just walked into the bathroom to see half my pads strewn across the floor. Pretty sure that's Frejya's fault (and that I have to start storing them behind a childproof lock). Her favorite \"toys\" are hair ties though.", "Exactly, like how do you spoil a dog with toys? It's not like they can count and go brag to their friends that they have more stuff. \n\nIt's ridiculous", "You could've just posted this as a response to the thread vs. a response to my post - unless you are referencing something I specifically said?\n\nI'm not being a dick - I am just legitimately unsure if there's a discussion here that you've offered.", "[deleted]", "As is their right. Dogs are roommates, cats are landlords.", "Every kitty needs didemboweling practice.", ">After the 5th time the bearings were replaced\n\nWow, that\u2019s getting a lot of use", "I really want to get a wheel but I'm in a 2nd floor apartment and just don't think my downstairs neighbor would appreciate the noise.", "Right?! I worry for the way the sister treats her pup by the way she thinks toys are spoiling, admits to her dog having no toys and calls dogs brats. Not saying the sister physically abuses her pup but I feel sad thinking about her dog having a very depressing and unstimulated life", "I had a friend come visit once. She brought her poodle. My dog was so excited to see her, he brought out every single toy he had and put them in a line in front of her. I almost had an asthma attack laughing so hard. My friend and I still laugh about it.", "Yes I was specifically replying to the part of your comment where you said \"She doesn't seem like she cared to hear your opinion nor did you care to hear hers\" I just genuinely think OP shouldn't even be expected to or willing to listen to the opinion of someone who thinks neglecting her dogs needs (playing and stimulation from toys is a need) is somehow an okay way to treat pets", "Putting your hand up and shushing someone in their own house while you're criticizing them is just as disrespectful, if not more so.", "LOL different family dynamics exist.... it isn't uncommon for my brother to answer his phone \"Sup Fucker?\" Or for me to tell him to fuck right off if he says something outlandish.  I don't think its that big of a deal in a lot of families.", "He was 15 pounds of solid muscle. That\u2019s a lot of force to slam onto something, then off, then back on again.", "It is not so bad on carpet. My roommate\u2019s bedroom suite was directly under the wheel and it pretty much sounded like a 30 second thunderstorm. Over and over again every minute or two for 10 minutes.", "Exactly! Who doesn't buy toys for dogs? \n\nWhy even have a dog if you think this way about them?", "OMG,.soooo cute!", "I mean... Okay. I didn't say he was expected to or that he should be willing to listen to his sister's opinion.\n\nMy statement wasn't wrong - you perceived it as me indicating he should want her opinion and I was *not*  saying that (e.g. I didn't say \"you should care to hear your sister's opinion\").\n\nRegardless, I don't understand the point of this conversation as we do not disagree on animal care/toys and I'm not even sure what you're disagreeing with here. But I do not see it being very productive if it were to continue so-\n\ngood day to you.\n\ud83e\udee1", "Right?! Some people just shouldn't be allowed to have pets", "Cool"]}
