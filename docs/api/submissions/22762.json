My sister asked me how many he has and I told her 12. She started lecturing me about how I\u2019m \u2018spoiling him rotten\u2019 and \u2018wasting\u2019 my money. Told me I was turning him into a brat, even though he is a very well behaved dog. I asked her how many her dog\u2019s got and she said she doesn\u2019t give him any toys. \n\nShe then went right back to saying I shouldn\u2019t be spending so much money. When I tried to interrupt she held up her hand and shushed me, so I told her to shut the fuck up, and that it\u2019s my own money and I can spend it however I want. I also said that it\u2019s none of her business and if she\u2019s gonna criticize me from how I use my money she should just leave. My sister seemed really upset. Did I blow it out of proportion?\n\n\nEDIT to add : No, I do not owe her any money. I\u2019ve never borrowed from my sister.\n\nUPDATE : Thank you so much for all your comments. She called me twenty minutes ago. She admitted that she was pushy but still maintained that dog toys are unnecessary and that her dog is fine without them. I told her that if she does not want to spend the money on toys, I am willing to buy some for her dog. She said \u2018Fine. Whatever.\u2019 I\u2019m about to leave my house and buy some dog toys for her dog now.
