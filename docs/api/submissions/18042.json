When I was pregnant with our second child, my husband had sex with Jess. We had a five year old at home, our son, who is the light of my life but also can be a lot of work. I found out about Jess when I waddled to my front door to answer the bell and saw her standing there. She'd told my husband she was pregnant and he ghosted her, according to her, so she went to his house to confront him.\n\nJess swore up and down that she didn't know my husband was married or that I was pregnant (but how can the second be true if the first is?). I kicked her out anyway. My husband swore to me that he would never see Jess again, for any reason. All stuff pertaining to their child would go through the courts.\n\nOur daughter is six months old, and Jess called yesterday asking my husband to go to the hospital because she is in labor. I told her no and hung up. She called again and begged. She said I'm punishing her son, not my husband, and it isn't fair. I called her a wh*** and she called me a hateful c***. I then unplugged the landline.\n\nI don't know if I'm going insane, if these are post pregnancy hormones or what. Every time I look at my son or daughter I feel guilt and grief. Was I unfair to Jess's son? I hate her, but he's just an innocent baby. Was I cruel to keep my husband from his birth?

I am not asking to shield your husband but to safeguard your children's interest. At any court of law, child support towards your children will depend on how many total children your husband has. And  presence during child birth can be taken a assuming fatherhood to the child.", "You\u2019re an idiot to stay married to the gross man you call your husband.  I feel awful for your children.  A cheater for a Dad and a doormat and enabler for a Mom.  Neither of you has those kids best interests at heart and ultimately they will be the ones to suffer from both of y\u2019alls immaturity and selfishness.

And I hope you keep this in mind when you divorce him and leave him dry with alimony and child support.", "ESH\n\nI'd say you were an AH to Jess over the phone, and was unfair to Jess's son. There's a good chance that Jess really didn't know your husband was married and was just as much of a victim in all of this as you are. I understand you hate her, and why you hate her, but in the end she isn't the one you're actually pissed at.\n\nYour husband is an AH because he cheated on you, and from the sounds of it it wasn't just a one night stand.\n\nJess... well she could be completely innocent or she might be exactly who you think she is.

Not Jess.  \n\nIf she didn't know that your husband was married, she had no way of knowing he had a pregnant wife!  The two go together - a nonexistent wife can't be pregnant, of course.  It would make no sense for her not to know he's married, but to know his wife was pregnant. \n\nIf you're mad about your husband having an affair, you need to hold him accountable, as the person involved with the greatest obligation to respect your marriage.  \n\nYour husband now has a son.  And you're pressuring him to be a deadbeat parent.  He's likely to owe child support, and in the end, that would come out of money that is currently used for your household.  As a parent, he also ought to be having visitation or some sort of custody arrangement.  \n\nAnd if anything happens to Jess, your husband, as the father, would probably get custody of the child.  What would you do, then?  We've has a few horror stories, here, where the affair partner died, the husband gained custody of the child, and expected his wife to care for it, and the child wound up neglected, sometimes upset to be the only child in the household not to get to call the wife \"mom,\" etc.  \n\nYou cannot make plans for the future on the assumption that your husband (and you) can walk away and pretend this child doesn't exist. \n\nAnd it is wrong to blame only Jess and the child, while accepting your husband back on the condition that he neglect this child. He's responsible for his actions, and needs to be prepared to take responsibility for the next 18-21 years.  That child is as much his child as your children are.  \n\nYou're blaming Jess, and taking it out on her child, because it is easier for you than blaming your husband and holding him accountable.  \n\nThe child is, as you say, innocent.  And if your husband lied to Jess and told her that he was single, then he's exploited her, and she's far less to blame than your husband is.  \n\nReverse the order in which you are holding people accountable.  First in line for accountability needs to be your husband, not Jess or her child.", "YTA for not leaving his ass", "YTA\n\n\nLol\n\n\nOf course she didn't know you were pregnant if she didn't know about you.

How would it make sense she didn't knew about you, but about your pregnancy? \n\n\nJess didn't make a vow to you but got fucked over by your husband. You are enabling him.", "YTA. Jess was probably shocked to find a wife, and a pregnant one at that so of course she was having diarhea of the mouth. It doesn't mean she was lying. \n\nIf you're going to stay with your husband, you need to accept the consequences of his actions. You don't have to like it, but he created a child and it isn't fair to the child to be segregated away from his father just because you don't like Jess. \n\nAlso your husband sounds like a huge asshole.", "NTA \n\nYour not obligated to run interference between your husband and his mistress. she should have made other arrangements if he blocked her or she would know how to contact him.

If he swore to never see her again, why was she calling for him to be at the hospital?  Did he not pass on the message?

Hard to say.\n\nBut there's one clear and obvious asshole: the man who can't keep his pants buttoned. \n\nYou deserve better than guilt, grief, and worrying whether you're going insane. I hope you can see that and do what needs to be done.", "Hopefully Jess has a good lawyer and goes after child support, no one dumber than a woman who stays with a cheater. Get ready for years of trouble and doubt.", "EHS and YTA\n\nAlso, you are calling her a Wh*** but what about your husband?

Honestly it's sad that neither of you washed your hands of this asshole.", "You hate her but not your husband??? He cheated-not her\u2026 he made vows to you to be faithful-not her\u2026.

I'm sorry you're going through this, especially right now. But.\n\n1. Jess probably didn't know about you, regardless, she didn't take vows and break them so you don't have a right to be pissed at her or take it out on her. She's probably pretty fucked up over the situation without you dogpiling the anger that should be directed at your husband onto her.\n2. Her child is the brother of your children. I dunno what those dynamics will be like in the future, but you really need to sit with that because whatever it means, it's irrefutable.

Why are you comfortable staying with a man who is happy to neglect one of his children? Is it because you're worried he will neglect your children if you leave him? Or that you will have to coparent with him and his affair partner if you left him?\n\nThose are genuine concerns, and I've known people stay with cheating spouses specifically to avoid those situations. But, is this the life you want for yourself? Do you want to feel forced to make decisions like this repeatedly? The other child isnt going away, and they are innocent in this awful mess your husband has created. You clearly don't like who you are becoming because of the intense guilt you feel. That's not going to go away. And is that the parent you want your children to have?\n\nPlease reconsider the reality of the situation, and try to act according to your morals instead of your pain.

First of all, it's weird that she knew where he lived but apparently not that he was married. Did she not question why she was never allowed over? And she said \"I didn't know he was married. I didn't know you were pregnant.\" Like you said, how could she know someone she didn't know exists was pregnant? It's weird to say both. I'm not saying she definitely lied. I can't say that with full confidence. It's just a gut feeling. But my gut didn't tell me my husband was cheating, so what does it know, I guess.", "It also isn\u2019t OP\u2019s responsibility to facilitate that contact though. That is up to the husband and Jess. He is the one who didn\u2019t bother to find out how Jess was doing. If he had wanted to be at the hospital, he could have set up some way to find out. Instead he just noped out and now he gets to plan his wife for it all (even though he had ghosted Jess before OP knew).", "At the point of labor she\u2019s known for months and could\u2019ve/should\u2019ve made alternate arrangements though. Why is OP the AH for a mistress who didn\u2019t plan ahead and the shitty husband that screwed them both over? I\u2019m not the type to say \u201cyou don\u2019t or them anything\u201d but in this case she definitely doesn\u2019t owe them anything. This moment does not matter to the newborn, sperm donation does not a father make and he clearly will not be a father.", "You might be right. A who still has a landline?", "Yeah, why did Jess call (let alone know - ok, The White Pages, but still) their landline number versus calling hubby directly?  I believe that Jess knew way more about hubby's marital status than she was letting on, and she is just continuing to harass them (namely OP) because OP didn't let go of him when the affair was exposed.  Probably best that he gets a DNA test before he's stuck paying child support for a baby that isn't his.  \n\n\nNTA", "Precisely, and that what irks me with all the Y T A judgement, Jess had 6 whole months to figure this one out. Jess and her kid is not OP's problem, but her garbage husband.", "This is what I want to know!", "NTA & I just asked the same question - Jess is most likely harassing OP for staying with her husband.", "Thank you!\n\nIn the end, I'm not taking Jess's side.  I'm taking the side of the obligation to be a responsible parent.\n\nTo that end, it doesn't even matter whether or not Jess knew that the man she was seeing was married.  Because it doesn't make the child any less his.  \n\nThe husband has three children, all equally his. Two with OP, one with Jess. All owed financial support, social acceptance, and his parental care.  \n\nAnyone encouraging a parent to be a deadbeat in their responsibilities to their children is AH.  \n\nOP needs to figure out how to move forward in this situation.  But \"husband will be a deadbeat to one of his kids, for my benefit and the benefit of the children he has with me\" can't be part of any solution.", "Yta to yourself for still being with the dude,like come on he had a whole baby on you \ud83d\udc80 but of course your only gonna care about hurting the other woman and not actually do something about your cheating husband", "It's not hard to find a person's info on the internet. It's very possible she did some snooping and found these things out after he ghosted her.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t like the way she said it? Your husband is to blame- not her. Get a backbone and grow up.", "Who knows what he told her. Maybe he told her he was casually dating you, or that you had split up, or ???", "Wow! You are so determined to blame Jess & punish her child instead of the one person in all of this that 1000% *knew* he was married, which is your husband. \n\nYTA & messed up big time. An innocent child isn't to blame & you have no evidence to prove that Jess knew about you or your children (pregnancy) during your husband's affair with her. You do realize that both things she said could be true due to her not knowing about you until she had to work to find your husband after he ghosted her (after getting her pregnant I might add) & then seeing you pregnant could have caused the second statement, right? \n\nListen, you can be hurt & upset over what happened, but you shouldn't punish an innocent child. Telling him or handing him the phone was all you had to do if you didn't want to hear about it. Since he's still living with you, then you either have forgiven him or you haven't. The moment you chose to punish & blame Jess & her son & not place the majority of that onto the one who actually caused all of this (your husband) is when you became an AH.", "Funny how you blame the affair partner but not your cheating asshole of a husband.

He/she is going to be a sibling to your kids, and will be taking up a chunk of your husband's time. He/she will even have to come over to YOUR house, and often.\n\nThis is the reality. Him missing the birth of the child doesn't change this reality.\n\nSorry again.\n\nHe cheated on you, remorselessly, and will do it again. You seem to think if you can keep her and the kid away from him, everything will be fine.\n\nI'm sorry, but it won't. It's fucked, and ignoring that reality isn't going to help you on the long term.\n\nYou are angry at the wrong person here.

Or was there nothing until baby day? Family dynamics are all so different. There could be a million reasons why she stayed with him. I\u2019m betting kids are at the top of that list though. People stay \u201cfor the kids\u201d and really believe they are doing a good selfless thing, but in reality, the kids are the chains that keep them with their spouse."]}
