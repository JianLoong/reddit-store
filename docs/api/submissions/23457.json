To put it simply, sex before marriage was the worst sin possible, we were told to dress modestly as to not to cause boys to \u201cstumble\u201d, and a woman\u2019s entire goal was to get married and become a good wife and mother. I came out as queer and left the church during university, and met my partner and now fianc\u00e9 a few years later. Sex is a normal and wonderful part of our relationship. It took a lot of work to not feel like I was a terrible person every time I had sex, due to the purity culture crap, but I\u2019m in a great place now. \n\nSo onto the wedding shower. A friend and I are getting married about a month apart. She\u2019s still involved in the church, and I love her dearly! Everyone has the right to practice their faith and religion the way they want. However, a big part of wedding culture in the church I\u2019m from is the underlying understanding that this will be the FIRST TIME the couple will be having sex. OoOoOooOoh. So \u201clingerie showers\u201d are often a part of the festivities.

No one is going to be looking at you or wondering if you had sex! \n\nIt's ok, go ahead, go, and enjoy those cute little panties!", "NTA- first and foremost I'm sorry that you had to experience that. Sex is normal and healthy as you've said. It's so creepy to me a a w,e,,whow they act like it's this super sacred mystical thing, but at the same time make it EVERYBODY'S business ya know? But anywaym how hurt would your friend be if yo,u didn't attend? Can you make a quick app andearance and then leave before the lingerie comes out? Does everybody know about your situation already? Why can't you just sit there and make occasional comments like \"aww that's cute\" or \"he'll love that\" or \"that's a pretty color\"?? Or is it just the fact that you're uncomfortable because you know you're being judged by those in attendance?? \n\n.", "NAH but as someone who had to cut away the church part of my life while still trying to have friends who were involved, AND as a queer and trans person myself, it might not end up well. just something to think about.", "NTA. That sounds like it would be a very uncomfortable experience. How does your church feel about lying about being \"sick from food poisoning must've been that crab salad I ate, so sorry I can't come.\" That seems like the most face-saving approach.", "If this is truly a friend you care about, then YTA.\n\nThere's no reason for you to talk about your sex life at all during *her* shower. You can nod and laugh along with everyone else over the lingerie and banter. There is no need for you to add to the conversation with details of your sex life. \n\nIf your friend wants you there and you also want to be there, I say suck it up and go. Your friend clearly doesn't care about your sex life and views on religion so why do you care about what a bunch of random women think?", "What the heck is all this?", "You will \\*\\*not\\*\\* be the only person there who had sex before marriage, I absolutely guarantee it.", "That's actually a tough one. It depends on how much the event will require you to feel uncomfortable.

Invent an excuse. It's not her fault if her friends are going to make you uncomfortable. And I'm sure it's not her intention.", "NTA for not wanting to go, but it would good if you could suck it up for your friend. Besides, I spent my teenage years in an evangelical church, and you absolutely won\u2019t be the only person there who has had sex outside marriage. At least one was forced to get married because she got pregnant, and at least one married woman is having random hookups while the kids are at school. And another married woman is married to someone who\u2019s been forced to stay in the closet.

No one is going to be analyzing your giggles or overly knowledgeable comments about sex. Because it\u2019s not about you lol- it\u2019s about the bride. You will not be the center of attention at all. Just go and giggle, and just don\u2019t say anything about sex? Like, if this is a friend you dearly love I really do not think that making her bridal shower about your sex life will be hard.", "NTA\u2026 but maintaining that depends completely on HOW you decline. Personally, I\u2019d just make up a scheduling conflict and say that\u2019s why I can\u2019t go, and still send a gift to her. No one has to know why you can\u2019t make it.\n\nAs a side note, anyone here saying Y T A clearly has absolutely NO IDEA what it\u2019s like to grow up in evangelical circles and all that entails, how painful the process of deconstruction is, and how triggering shit like this can be\u2026. Particularly for LGBTQ+ individuals. Not wanting to be around that is completely and 100% valid.", "NTA. I was raised in that culture and it SUUUUUUUCKED.", "I would bet you $1000 that many of those women had premarital sex.  Seriously they\u2019re all my age and Gen x didn\u2019t give a fck then and most still don\u2019t.  YTA if you don\u2019t go.  It\u2019s a party for your friend not you. You are not the center of attention and no one should be discussing your sex life.  I just went to a bridal shower last month. The couple has been living together for two years. I bought sexy lingerie as a present because why not? (And they have everything). Yes there\u2019s still giggling. Go and just have fun.", "NTA. That\u2019s a tough position to be in. Would it be possible to discuss it with your friend beforehand, explain your concerns, and see what she suggests? She clearly still values you as part of her life and is presumably aware that you no longer follow her church\u2019s dictates.

Sorry to break it to you so harshly, but chances are strong that other unmarried women there have also had sex. Or some form of sex that they figure skirts the rules.\n\nSo my advice is to play the part. Go. Have fun. Don't volunteer that you have some personal knowledge. Be there for your friend. Don't ham it up, pretending you don't know what this sex business is. But don't give personal testimony about the flavor of edible underwear.

There's almost no positive for you. Conservative groups tend to really make people who aren't \"pure\" as uncomfortable - or worse - as much as they can. If even ONE thing slips out, whether by your friend, yourself, or someone else... Well, it could go downhill very fast.\n\nWhat a lot of people who say \"yta\" believe is that since its not about you, then you should suck it up and go. What they forget is that your life is still about you, and you have a right not to go if it makes you feel uncomfortable. Especially in a situation that could go really wrong if there is even a tiny slipup. I don't blame you for not wanting to go, I couldn't imagine needing to pretend that lingerie is some super taboo thing and getting kicky feet just because of some lacy underwear. You can find other ways to celebrate her outside of the wedding shower that don't make you uncomfortable.", "NAH\n\nJust skip it and make a friend date to make up for it. She might enjoy being able to ask you sex questions she couldn\u2019t ask her other friends. She probably wouldn\u2019t have time to socialize with you much in such a big setting anyway. \n\nIf she asks just say it\u2019s triggering for you, which I imagine is true. Hopefully she will understand that.", "YTA. This is a party for your friend, to celebrate her. Nobody there is going to know your sexual history unless you go in and announce it, which would be tacky on your part.

Let them be uncomfortable with their closed minds or maybe they will surprise you and also won\u2019t be such sticks in the mud.  This friend obviously is open minded so maybe so are her other guests.

As a queer person from a similar background i can understand your hesitation to attend. It will be extremely uncomfortable and you are going to feel like every person in the room thinks you're a siner. That being said nobody actually knows. You aren't doing anything wrong having a consenting relationship with your partner. If this friend is someone who would be hurt by you not going you should go.

Do what is best for your friendship.", "NTA - unfortunately, through no fault of your own, you\u2019d draw attention away from the bride and make the whole thing awkward.

I know this because I used to be one.  It's really awkward being in this type of situation post-belief.\n\nit really is your choice if you want to play along, cause a giant rift as they agonize about the horrific idea of pre-marital sex or avoid it altogether.  Personally, I found myself drift away from people who had super strict religious beliefs when I lost my faith in the fairy monster.  Nonreligious people just treat other people better instead of being super judgemental about nonsense.", "Nta\n\nBut don't hide who you are for them, who cares if they know you had sex, f em.", "I'm always interested in the food at showers.  Some of those Christian gals can throw down some tasty dishes. or not but it's fun to see what's new in non-alcoholic beverages.  Show up, support your friend, have a bit of a giggle and a bite to eat.  You can always make an \"Irish Exit\", i.e making a beeline for the door when you want to leave a party quickly and discreetly - maybe when you see all their heads bow.", "NTA but damn are you missing out on an experience.", "Nah, but honestly if this is a dear friend you should suck it up for her sake and be there to support her.", "YTA- this party isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about your friend. This is a special occasion for someone you  supposedly care about, but your entire rant is about yourself. Just keep your mouth shut, be there for your friend and have fun. If you can\u2019t do that, admit to your friend that your own self-absorption and mental hangups are more important than being there for someone during one of the most important times of their life.

The weird pressure, the disavowal of any ownership of one's body while demanding constant control of every little thing, constant judgement and reified misogyny, the miserable build up of pressure in teens and early 20s over biological urges, the constant cycles of shame and regret, being unable to defend yourself from sexualised behaviours because it's \"your fault\". \n\nI can't blame you for not wanting to go to a party celebrating that. I would be sick with the thought of it.", "Honestly NTA, but more because if I were you I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable returning to ANY church-sanctioned event from a place that peddles purity culture, especially as these places often have beliefs that are socially less progressive, I.e. they wouldn\u2019t accept LGBTQ populations. \n\nPeople saying \u201cthis isn\u2019t about you\u201d are kind of thinking about this wrong imo. Yeah, it\u2019s not ABOUT you, but you have to be there and will have to mingle. You will have to actively (direct conversation) or passively (anything like sideways looks, etc) have judgement passed on you, and these are the types of places to do a lot of whispering. And even if you DON\u2019T care to impress these people, it can still weigh heavily on you.\n\nBesides all that, I\u2019d just\u2026 personally find the whole section of the wedding where everyone gets involved in the new couple\u2019s sex life uncomfortable. It\u2019s just odd.", "NTA. \n\nweddings and their associated events are invitations, not obligations.

Maybe get coffee, do something sweet for her. \n\nAlso god*damn* a lot of people here CLEARLY have had the good fortune of never experiencing the trauma and bullshit of purity culture.

But OP is clearly frustrated at the possibility of not attending but also worried that she\u2019ll be seen as some harlot and sinner within her entire community (a community well-known for proclaiming non-upstanding members as heretics). She is, in this instance being appropriately selfish (even though I wouldn\u2019t call it that) by thinking of her needs as they would affect both her AND the bride at this party. I have a feeling that it coming out that OP has already had sex is something that will distract from the bride far more than her absence. \n\nJust some food for thought :)", "\"among never-married fundamentalist adults between 2008 and 2018, 86% of females had at least one opposite-sex sexual partner since age 18.\"\n\nOP, I'm sorry you have to deal with this charade, but you're in the good company of 86% of those still in the religion.\n\nStatistic is from the Institute of Family Studies.", "True. OP might make the \"virgin\" feel less guilty.", "Not putting yourself in an uncomfortable/triggering situation is not the same as taking out your resentment on others.", "NTA. It\u2019s not selfish to not want to put yourself in triggering situations. It\u2019s not like OP went on a rant to her friend about how her religion is toxic and patriarchal or something.", "Yeah looking at this thread OP seems to be digging up problems. A 100 bucks say she'll bring up that she had sex just for the attention", "Oh my god everyone is acting like youre the out of touch prude and \"everyyyyonnnne has had sexxxx duh\" um NO THATS NOT THE CASE IN HYPER RELIGIOUS PURITY CULTURE CHURCH COMMUNITIES JFC READ THE GODDMAN POST \n\n*IF* any of these unmarried or married women had/have premarital sex, or any kind of sexual experience (including masturbation!), it is their DEEPEST, DARKEST, MOST SHAMEFUL SECRET. Your perception of what this event will be like is spot on. Source: been there, done that for all of my girl friends and girl cousins and yes, raised extremely conservative with all the fun presents that comes with (including purity culture)\n\nSorry im just really ticked off by everyone automatically assuming youre the dumb one who's overreacting. \"Statistically.\" They CLEARLY have never interacted with purity culture. (Lucky.)\n\nOh and if youre anything like me, I hid my life and its sordid details expertly well from my small town so no, they dont necessarily know your shit.", "I'm just happy they accept you for who you are. My advice is also to just roll with it. It is nice to see religious people who are not judgemental. They invited you so you're welcome. :)", "The best part of believe is the lie - Pete Wentz", "I grew up in the church and the idea of \"technical virginity\" is a thing. As in, it's okay to do everything from A to Y as long as you just don't do \"Z.\" In fact at my sister's wedding rehearsal dinner the bridesmaids were singing the Alphabet song. And this was not her first boyfriend, if you get my drift. But believe me, you won't be the only person there who's had sex before marriage.", ">a very small religious community\n\nI grew up evangelical. Private schools, Oral Roberts, Rodney Howard Browne, all that nonsense.\n\nYour old church does not sound like it's part of that community at all. It sounds like an actual cult.\n\nFor all their shit, the evangelical crowd is not that dogmatic by default. What you described is some weird offshoot.\n\nSo, why would you want to hang around people who are in a cult?", "Yeah, I went to evangelical Christian school from preschool through high school. Less than 200 kids in the combined middle school high school. Kind of place that only taught creationism. Took purity pledges. We didn\u2019t learn sex Ed because \u201cwe didn\u2019t need it since we were waiting for marriage\u201d.  \n\nWhich would explain the one or two teen pregnancies each year. My graduating class of 32 kids miraculously hadn\u2019t had one, but there were definitely girls who\u2019d done \u201ceverything but\u201d.\n\nPlus  my friend, the 22 yr old youth pastor married his pregnant fianc\u00e9e and had a baby 6 months later. \n\nOh, and that\u2019s just the *consensual* activities I know about. There was a large public arrest and lawsuit the year after I graduated. \n\nSo, it\u2019s probably not MUCH different that where you are. And people may ACT a certain way. But they are almost universally HYPOCRITES. **Or** else they are JUST LIKE YOU and playing along to get through the day. Surely you know this??? Surely you didn\u2019t think YOU were actually a sinner??  \n\nEVERYONE is playing the game. The difference is whether they are *playing it ironically* or not. You seem to think everyone is being serious about the chastity. Some people are just more private about their sex life because of the judgment not because they co-sign it.", "Extra points though if you get the giggles during the event.", "I grew up in a super evangelical purity culture church. As a naive teenager, I believed none of my peers had sex in HS/before marriage. But in my early 20s (even when still attending church before leaving religion completely in my late 20s) I figured out how not true that was - but yes still incredibly \u201cscandalous.\u201d At my own bachelorette party I felt I had to pretend like I\u2019d never had sex. So it IS absolutely going to be their biggest shameful secret if still religious. Doesn\u2019t mean it hasn\u2019t happened.", "No one said the not-quite-virgins where going to raise their hands and let out whoops. \n\nEven some Mormons do that \u201csoaking\u201d thing, and a much older friend of mine (male) said he and his Iranian girlfriend in the 70s (he was overseas, and would\u2019ve never been allowed to marry her) had tons of oral sex because she could keep her hymen intact that way.", "Point 3 is all that needs to be said. Taking a step back from an event--however important--because you know attending will negatively impact your well being and likely the event itself is a sign of maturity and responsibility for yourself. That's called setting boundaries.", "Oh honestly don't bother, you have to sift through the 'RED FLAG OP' and 'YTA OP, immediately reverse course of action or you will be the cause of misery for thousands' in here.\n\nSome people are all or nothing in this sub, no nuance.", "Don't forget that op is also queer, chances are she'll also receive quite a bit of homophobia from these evangelical women.

Or do they take the bride-to-be into a room with only the married people for tips and tricks?\n\nI have never had any desire to share my sexual encounters with anyone, even if someone else bring theirs up in conversation. It honestly isn't that difficult to keep quiet about something you prefer to keep private.", "It\u2019s uncomfortable sure, but you\u2019re very much making it about you if you don\u2019t go. Like how are you gonna explain it? It sounds really overly dramatic. Just go and smile along. You\u2019re turning a mole hill into a mountain.", "Yeah skip it. As a fellow queer person, I wouldn't be caught dead at a happy clapper event like this. NTA", "She does not word it like that in her post. She puts everyone else down and thinks everyone will be asking her about her sex life or something when the wedding shower is about her friend. \n\nBut perhaps you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s telling them this directly, she just wants out. I\u2019ll do some self-reflection on my opinion on this one. Thanks.", "I'm not trying to be harsh with OP at all. I think she  should not go in assuming it will be terrible .
