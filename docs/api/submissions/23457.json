I came out as queer and left the church during university, and met my partner and now fianc\u00e9 a few years later. Sex is a normal and wonderful part of our relationship.

A friend and I are getting married about a month apart. She\u2019s still involved in the church, and I love her dearly! Everyone has the right to practice their faith and religion the way they want.

Sex is normal and healthy as you've said. It's so creepy to me a a w,e,,whow they act like it's this super sacred mystical thing, but at the same time make it EVERYBODY'S business ya know? But anywaym how hurt would your friend be if yo,u didn't attend? Can you make a quick app andearance and then leave before the lingerie comes out? Does everybody know about your situation already? Why can't you just sit there and make occasional comments like \"aww that's cute\" or \"he'll love that\" or \"that's a pretty color\"?? Or is it just the fact that you're uncomfortable because you know you're being judged by those in attendance?? \n\n.", "NAH but as someone who had to cut away the church part of my life while still trying to have friends who were involved, AND as a queer and trans person myself, it might not end up well. just something to think about.", "NTA. That sounds like it would be a very uncomfortable experience. How does your church feel about lying about being \"sick from food poisoning must've been that crab salad I ate, so sorry I can't come.\" That seems like the most face-saving approach.", "If this is truly a friend you care about, then YTA.\n\nThere's no reason for you to talk about your sex life at all during *her* shower. You can nod and laugh along with everyone else over the lingerie and banter. There is no need for you to add to the conversation with details of your sex life. \n\nIf your friend wants you there and you also want to be there, I say suck it up and go. Your friend clearly doesn't care about your sex life and views on religion so why do you care about what a bunch of random women think?", "What the heck is all this?", "You will \\*\\*not\\*\\* be the only person there who had sex before marriage, I absolutely guarantee it.", "That's actually a tough one. It depends on how much the event will require you to feel uncomfortable.

Invent an excuse. It's not her fault if her friends are going to make you uncomfortable. And I'm sure it's not her intention.", "NTA for not wanting to go, but it would good if you could suck it up for your friend. Besides, I spent my teenage years in an evangelical church, and you absolutely won\u2019t be the only person there who has had sex outside marriage. At least one was forced to get married because she got pregnant, and at least one married woman is having random hookups while the kids are at school. And another married woman is married to someone who\u2019s been forced to stay in the closet.

No one is going to be analyzing your giggles or overly knowledgeable comments about sex. Because it\u2019s not about you lol- it\u2019s about the bride. You will not be the center of attention at all. Just go and giggle, and just don\u2019t say anything about sex? Like, if this is a friend you dearly love I really do not think that making her bridal shower about your sex life will be hard.", "NTA\u2026 but maintaining that depends completely on HOW you decline. Personally, I\u2019d just make up a scheduling conflict and say that\u2019s why I can\u2019t go, and still send a gift to her. No one has to know why you can\u2019t make it.\n\nAs a side note, anyone here saying Y T A clearly has absolutely NO IDEA what it\u2019s like to grow up in evangelical circles and all that entails, how painful the process of deconstruction is, and how triggering shit like this can be\u2026. Particularly for LGBTQ+ individuals. Not wanting to be around that is completely and 100% valid.", "NTA. I was raised in that culture and it SUUUUUUUCKED.", "I would bet you $1000 that many of those women had premarital sex.  Seriously they\u2019re all my age and Gen x didn\u2019t give a fck then and most still don\u2019t.  YTA if you don\u2019t go.  It\u2019s a party for your friend not you. You are not the center of attention and no one should be discussing your sex life.  I just went to a bridal shower last month. The couple has been living together for two years. I bought sexy lingerie as a present because why not? (And they have everything). Yes there\u2019s still giggling. Go and just have fun.", "NTA. That\u2019s a tough position to be in. Would it be possible to discuss it with your friend beforehand, explain your concerns, and see what she suggests? She clearly still values you as part of her life and is presumably aware that you no longer follow her church\u2019s dictates.

Sorry to break it to you so harshly, but chances are strong that other unmarried women there have also had sex. Or some form of sex that they figure skirts the rules.\n\nSo my advice is to play the part. Go. Have fun. Don't volunteer that you have some personal knowledge. Be there for your friend. Don't ham it up, pretending you don't know what this sex business is. But don't give personal testimony about the flavor of edible underwear. Chances are, as with most of life, the others won't be paying as much attention to you as you expect they will.", "NTA.\n\nEven if this friend is super important to you, the problem is that you'll be thrown into an uncomfortable scenario no matter how you try to be in this wedding shower. There's almost no positive for you. Conservative groups tend to really make people who aren't \"pure\" as uncomfortable - or worse - as much as they can. If even ONE thing slips out, whether by your friend, yourself, or someone else... Well, it could go downhill very fast.\n\nWhat a lot of people who say \"yta\" believe is that since its not about you, then you should suck it up and go. What they forget is that your life is still about you, and you have a right not to go if it makes you feel uncomfortable. Especially in a situation that could go really wrong if there is even a tiny slipup. I don't blame you for not wanting to go, I couldn't imagine needing to pretend that lingerie is some super taboo thing and getting kicky feet just because of some lacy underwear. You can find other ways to celebrate her outside of the wedding shower that don't make you uncomfortable.", "NAH\n\nJust skip it and make a friend date to make up for it. She might enjoy being able to ask you sex questions she couldn\u2019t ask her other friends. She probably wouldn\u2019t have time to socialize with you much in such a big setting anyway. \n\nIf she asks just say it\u2019s triggering for you, which I imagine is true. Hopefully she will understand that.", "YTA. This is a party for your friend, to celebrate her. Nobody there is going to know your sexual history unless you go in and announce it, which would be tacky on your part.

You don\u2019t need to go bragging about your sex life but you also don\u2019t need to hide who you are.  Let them be uncomfortable with their closed minds or maybe they will surprise you and also won\u2019t be such sticks in the mud.  This friend obviously is open minded so maybe so are her other guests.  Or maybe she plays along with the silly and you and your partner can laugh about it later while you contemplate how far you have come and how glad you are to be freeing yourself from those shame shackles.", "Yta, this is a celebration for your friend and your making it about you and your insecurities.", "It's all about you...", "NAH. As a queer person from a similar background i can understand your hesitation to attend. It will be extremely uncomfortable and you are going to feel like every person in the room thinks you're a siner. That being said nobody actually knows. You aren't doing anything wrong having a consenting relationship with your partner. If this friend is someone who would be hurt by you not going you should go. But if she's cool with you guys meeting up 1:1 at a different time then dont go. You know your friend best. Do what is best for your friendship.", "NTA - unfortunately, through no fault of your own, you\u2019d draw attention away from the bride and make the whole thing awkward.

I know this because I used to be one.  It's really awkward being in this type of situation post-belief.\n\nit really is your choice if you want to play along, cause a giant rift as they agonize about the horrific idea of pre-marital sex or avoid it altogether.  Personally, I found myself drift away from people who had super strict religious beliefs when I lost my faith in the fairy monster.  Nonreligious people just treat other people better instead of being super judgemental about nonsense.", "Nta\n\nBut don't hide who you are for them, who cares if they know you had sex, f em.", "I'm always interested in the food at showers.  Some of those Christian gals can throw down some tasty dishes. or not but it's fun to see what's new in non-alcoholic beverages.  Show up, support your friend, have a bit of a giggle and a bite to eat.  You can always make an \"Irish Exit\", i.e making a beeline for the door when you want to leave a party quickly and discreetly - maybe when you see all their heads bow.", "NTA but damn are you missing out on an experience.", "Nah, but honestly if this is a dear friend you should suck it up for her sake and be there to support her.", "YTA- this party isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about your friend. This is a special occasion for someone you  supposedly care about, but your entire rant is about yourself. Just keep your mouth shut, be there for your friend and have fun. If you can\u2019t do that, admit to your friend that your own self-absorption and mental hangups are more important than being there for someone during one of the most important times of their life.
