Why spend tons of money on something you'll only wear once? I wore a dress I already owned and later wore as a guest to other weddings (it was green and cream striped with flamingos, I didn't wear a wedding dress to a wedding, lol) and my husband bought new khakis, blazer, suit and tie that he knew he'd get a chance to wear all the time when he finished his PhD. Now that he's working, he wears it to the office all the time. Except the tie, he never wears those. My best friend spent money on a plus sized dress that actually fit her, but makes a point to lend it out to as many plus sized people who need wedding dresses that are actually their size, to the point where she lends it to friends of friends because it's hard to find nice dresses in that size, and she's already spent the money so she collective plus sized world might as well benefit as much as possible.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d reply to her post with \u2018hope you have other friends to have your back during your divorce, this wedding is the last thing I\u2019m helping you with.\u2019\n\nLet karma handle her.

She crossed a line by ghosting you instead of explaining, and another one by posting about you publicly. But is she okay?? Is it normal in your country for one partner paying for a wedding to mean the other partner can't invite anyone, not even their best friend? It feels like either she's \n\n1. cutting you off because she doesn't think you're worth inviting (she's the asshole)\n2. too nervous to ask her in-laws if she can invite someone (not great)\n3. being isolated by her in-laws, like maybe they're holding the expense over her head and making a big deal about how she should be grateful and not ask for anything else, and she doesn't know what to do about it (her in-laws are the asshole and they may be doing it to isolate her from people in her life and make her easier to abuse)", "INFO - She said that the fiance was paying and that she couldn\u2019t invite you. Is it possible that he is being controlling and not letting her invite anyone other than immediate family? It seems unusual that she would do this. Sure, weddings make people do a-hole things, but this kind of a-hole thing is different. It sounds like he might be trying to isolate her. Withholding judgment as this feels off to me.", "NTA holy shit. She exploited the heck out of you. She upset herself on her wedding day by deciding that was the right time to let you know.", "NTA\n\nyour \u201cfriend\u201c took advantage of you and is being massively toxic so you had every right to be furious especially after so many years of friendship", "Make sure to cancel or postpone the hair and makeup to another day YOU can use it, and do not tell her about it!! you can try and get the tiara back but it\u2019s probably a lost cause.", "post back about what you paid for and the got dumped by a selfish ahole.", "NTA\n\nShe was happy to accept your gifts but not invite you. \n\nYou are well rid of your ex \"friend.\"", "NTA wedding gifts are given in expectation of being at the wedding.  what can you get back? you're not going to the wedding so you don't have to give a gift.", "[removed]", "NTA but really wouldn\u2019t do that.

She is a shitty person cause it looks like she knew the whole time you and ur mom would not be invited.\n\nI understand you, and I feel you. It was your only friend and broke that trust and that relationship over getting \"gifts\" for her wedding. I have a question, did she ever back you up financially or emotionally at any point during those 30 years?\n\nIf yes, I can't even imagine to understand why the fuck  she did what she did.\nIf not, I guess she was using you the whole time as her safe space.\n\nHopefully you will never have to face her again and if you do... don't hold back.", "Then salt it.", "Wow, I do still have receipts, and all our conversations about the gifts and the dress!
