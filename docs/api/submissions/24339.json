I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first time she has disappointed you", "Please give an update if you do so!", "And pls to update us", "but be very matter of fact about it. \u201c(name) is saying untrue things about me. I\u2019d like to clear it up by showing what I paid for services for her. I was then ghosted and not invited to the wedding, after being friends for 30 years, but the most hurtful thing is spreading lies about me on social media. now that the truth is out, I won\u2019t be engaging with anyone who participates in the name calling or deceitful shaming.\u201d \n\nand then don\u2019t engage with them. that\u2019s the crucial move. if you really want to try and repair a relationship with someone who got involved, talk to them privately. but don\u2019t go getting into extended fights on social media, never a good look for anyone.", "Too late. Just enjoy the aftermath. And if the marriage doesn\u2019t work out, um, who is she again?", "Would you and your mom given as much if you knew you were not being invited?\n\nETA: I do not mean to come across has harsh or unfeeling.\n\nI strongly feel, without knowing the culture, you and your mom were taken advantage of.", "Send her a bill. And honestly, sue her if it's worth it to you. She def took advantage.", "NTA.  Post publicly how she took and took from you and your mom. Salt the damn earth", "NTA at all. \n\n>the food is not enough and the groom is paying for everything so she can't invite me \n\nThat is such a stupid argument. I am sure it is not just the groom's family and friends at their wedding, so even with the tradition being as it is, it is really implied that the groom's family is also paying for the bride's family and friends, especially her best friend.\n\nAlso food don't cost the world. It is far cheaper than a wedding dress and all the other things OP and her mother gifted her. \n\nIf it such a rude AH behavior to accept expensive gifts to a wedding and then not allow them to come. \n\n>She started posting on FB about toxic, jealous friends reffering to me with a special nickname, which everyone knows it..\n\nIf you and her have friends in common, tell them the truth. If they don't side with you after this, drop them as friends, too.", "NTA.. what on earth.. best friends for 30 years and not even an invite? something is seriously wrong with her", "NTA. \n\nYou offered to pay for those for her when she was unable to. Even considered them gifts for her wedding. Your mother even did WORK for the dress and she just skated off without it. \n\nShe should have invited you regardless of the reason, unless it was a completely valid one. And if the only thing stopping her was that there wasnt enough food, of which her groom's family paid for, then you dont need her in your life. \n\nI wish you the best of luck OP because thats one hell of a burn to a best friend whom youve been friends with for practically your whole life.", "NTA", "Do this!  Immediately do this.  To my mind it's perfectly nice to tell the truth, particularly when being libeled with untruths.  Very publicly.  Very loudly.  Let it rip, OP!  \n\nNTA", "Yes, please do this and give an update how the reactions are to that.", "Not the asshole. You sound like a loving and supportive friend who was taken advantage of and i\u2019m sorry that happened to you. I hope you can make some new friends who value your kindness and support & RECIPROCATE! Kick the AH friend to the curb.", "Send her te (bill/invoce) for all!\n\nNTA", "Wow NTA! It\u2019s not about the lack of invite, the problem is she took advantage and intentionally didn\u2019t tell you weren\u2019t invited. No one needs a deceptive friend like that. \n\nMy best friend couldn\u2019t be invited because of covid, but that didn\u2019t stop her from doing the most for me. She even baby sat my dog on the day of the wedding!", "NTA. you and your mother were incredibly generous and should obviously have been invited. \n\nWhat I don't understand is how it is that you did not know you were not invited until everything was paid in full and the dress and other items were picked up. Did you not wonder why you had not received an invitation?\n\nIt would have been so satisfying if you could have said, \"No, I will not give you the wedding gown, shoes, tiara, etc. If I am not invited to the wedding. \n\nI don't think that this woman still thought of you as a good friend.", "NTA  \nAnd send her an invoice for the services and items.", "Why didn\u2019t you respond back on her Facebook post with an itemised list of everything you organised, arranged, paid for, gifted, time put in for the dress etc and let the public decide whether you\u2019re \u2018the toxic one\u2019 \n\nI mean. She\u2019s taking it public after all", "That is waaayy to much energy to be giving this person... post your side of the story with receipts just to defend yourself, then block them all, take a bath, and enjoy your peace.\n\nNo need to let poisonous people live rent free in your head.", "You literally gave her wedding gifts as she's your friend and she proceeds to not invite you to her wedding?! She's for sure taking advantage! NTA and she's not your friend,  the entitlement she has amazes me", "Not the asshole.. that was shitty!", "Are you kidding? NTA. Why anyone would think otherwise is a mystery. It's not thoughtless, either. It sounds calculated and predatory.", "NTA, I'd post your side with receipts of payment.", "NTA. She knew exactly what she was doing. She just wanted free stuff. If I were you, I would make my own post about toxic friends taking advantage of people for money and favors and then dropping them when convenient. Make sure to tag her in it so the people that saw her previous post see it too.\n\nI would also post receipts with how much everything you paid for costs, and how much time and money it took your mom to make the dress, juuuust to add salt in the wound. But I\u2019m petty like that. \ud83d\ude43\n\nYou\u2019re better off without her.", "NTA. \n\nBut after this you shoudn't be calling her anything. She showed her colors, there is no point of continuing any communication.", "worth sharing what happened to fb friends and suggest the ex friend be treated carefully with favours, NTA", "Posy in pubic everything you paid for, all your mother did and how much that is worth and how she used you. She went public so you respond shaming her.", "If you\u2019re her only close friend and he didn\u2019t let her invite you, then I have to wonder if she was allowed to invite any friends. In which case I have to wonder if this guy is trying to isolate her bc he\u2019s abusive. Would make since for the not so vague booking.\nBut none of this changes the fact you are one hundo NTA.", "NTA. She led you on so that you'd bankroll her bridal attire. She knew what she was doing and was old enough to know it was wrong. \n\nYou should post the full story on Facebook, tag her, and let her know you'll take it down once she pays you back for everything.", "I absolutely would. I'm not a fan of shaming in general, but I do believe in using it to correct the record when someone has spoken publicly and unfairly about you. That's an absolutely right occasion for social censure IMO.", "Hahaha happy to help lol\n\nYou have to let some people just roll on out like a tumbleweed and move on.\n\nEasier said, I\u2019m not good at it lol, but I definitely avoid shedding tears in front of/for someone who could care less. You\u2019re better than that drama, and that was no friend to you. I\u2019m sorry, it sucks\u2026", "post on that facebook what you got for her and how she reacted to that. watch the monkeys turn. NTA", "OK. So there are some questions here. \n\nAre you perhaps, the pushy friend? Did she WANT those gifts or did you pick? Did she or you and your mother pick her dress design? Did she pick the hair and makeup person or did you? \n\nIf that's all genuinely her picks, then NTA. Otherwise, Maybe YTA", "Hey! Any updates?", "NTA. 1) Burn that s down. 2) Scatter the ashes. 3) Salt the earth. \n\nYou owe her nothing at this point.", "nta", "Also feel free to cancel the appointments or transfer them to yourself. If you paid, you still retain the right to cancel those.", "\u201cI say we take off and nuke the whole site from orbit. It\u2019s the only way to be sure.\u201d", "This, exactly this. It was already paid for - if she was worried about the money I would have used it to treat myself or my mum.", "You are not overreacting. Your ex friend behaved appallingly by letting you pay for so much when she knew she wasn\u2019t going to invite you. NTA", "NTA, op deserves better friends", "She 100 percent should do this. \n\nWhat an absolute user her ' friend ' is."]}
