Why spend tons of money on something you'll only wear once? I wore a dress I already owned and later wore as a guest to other weddings (it was green and cream striped with flamingos, I didn't wear a wedding dress to a wedding, lol) and my husband bought new khakis, blazer, suit and tie that he knew he'd get a chance to wear all the time when he finished his PhD. Now that he's working, he wears it to the office all the time. Except the tie, he never wears those. My best friend spent money on a plus sized dress that actually fit her, but makes a point to lend it out to as many plus sized people who need wedding dresses that are actually their size, to the point where she lends it to friends of friends because it's hard to find nice dresses in that size, and she's already spent the money so she collective plus sized world might as well benefit as much as possible."]}
