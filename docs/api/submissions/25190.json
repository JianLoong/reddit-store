Mark was previously married to a woman named Alexis and has a daughter (5f) with her. They did not have a very amicable split and even after a few years there is still some tension between them. Mark has asked that his daughter be able to attend the wedding as it is understandably very important to him.\n\nThe issue is they live several states away from us and Alexis will not allow her daughter to attend if she is not able to attend the wedding with her. She does not trust Mark's family to watch her and insists she needs to be able to keep an eye out herself. Mark is on board with her attending, but this is a firm no for me as this is my first marriage and the last thing I want is to look out at my wedding to see my new husbands ex-wife.\n\nI don't know if she is making this about the child or her failed relationship, but I have no idea why she would even want to attend her ex-husbands wedding. I do not want his ex there under any circumstances and I fear this will cause some resentment if his daughter does not attend.\n\nWIBTA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: It seems I've left out a lot of relevant information.  We planned for his mother to able to care for his daughter when Mark and I are unable. I do 100% want her at the wedding and think she needs to be apart of this day, but I do not want his ex-wife there. This is in no way wanting me to exclude his daughter from our lives. And prior to this coming about we made a point to state that no ex's of any capacity will be allowed at the wedding.

She doesn't want her 5 year old to be passed around extended family the girl doesn't know well or who may overlook her / see her as a burden. Totally relateable. I get why you wouldn't want her there but to not allow his daughter to attend because of it is a shitty move and does not paint you as a kind and benevolent step mother. You will have to have a relationship with this woman and her child out of necessity, don't make that harder for yourself by getting off on the wrong foot.", "Whilst I understand you don\u2019t want your partners ex wife at your wedding, I do, you need to understand that her first responsibility is to her child, and at 5 years old, she isn\u2019t old enough to attend alone.  If the ex wife does not have a good relationship with anyone there, how is she to trust them to take care of her daughter? Your partner will be taken up with you and the wedding (rightly so!) but that means no one is taking care of a five year old.", "You already posted this \n\nESH for still weaponizing a 5 year old", "YTA - Marrying a man who has to coparent means accepting that their ex is going to be in your life as well, at least to some small extent. I get not wanting to see your soon-to-be husband's ex at your wedding but getting married isn't about the wedding or reception or the attention, but about the love you share with your spouse and putting them first.\n\nMark is the one who has the history and tension with his ex and if he can stand for her to be there so his daughter is able to attend, you need to support him. If you won't, youre telling him your mild discomfort over a wedding guest that you hardly know matters more his daughter being able to attend one of the biggest moments of his life. \n\nI can't speak for Mark, but if I was in his position and my soon-to-be wife made that choice, I would be reevaluating if this marriage was a good idea", "YTA\n\n\"I don't know if she is making this about the child or her failed relationship, but I have no idea why she would even want to attend her ex-husbands wedding\"\n\n1. Wtf is \"the child\"? You are about to become the stepmother. She is your future stepdaughter. Stop disassociating.\n2. I understand not wanting your husband's ex at the wedding, but there is more that meets the eye than her \"failed relationship\".  For example the welfare of her child. She is 100% making this about her child. In fact, both parents are making it about their child, and your future husband is interested in the needs of his child, too.  Why aren't you?\n3. Why wasn't a nanny hired?\n4. Why wouldn't you allow your stepdaughter to attend, when her dad is getting married? And her dad wants her to?\n5. INFO: why did they divorce?

She doesn't just go away and you never deal with her; like it or not, she comes with your fianc\u00e9 and so does their child. This will far be the only event you'll have to see her at.\n\nIf you're not interested in dealing with Mark, his daughter and his ex wife, you're in the wrong relationship.", "YTA\n\nThe fact that you aren't fighting harder to include your future daughter in your own wedding is a huge red flag. It doesn't matter that she will be a step-daughter, she is still going to view you as a parent. She was young enough when you and Mark started dating that she will have no memories of times before your presence in her life - meaning you are a second mother to her, and only step-mother in title.\n\nDivorce can be hard on kids, especially when there's tension between the divorced parents and their new spouses. If you are willing to marry this man and take on the role of a mother, then you should see where Alexis is trying to make sure her daughter is safe (even if it is a little ridiculous she doesn't trust the girl's own father). Alexis is also TA here, but you should be making more of an effort to include this girl in your major life events if you're going to marry her father.", "Who move away ? What's the custody like ?\n\nEDIT : Since you can't be bothered to answer me, I'm going with YTA.", "If you are taking a five year old to a wedding, you have to do a lot more than \"keep an eye out for her\". A five year old at a wedding needs a full-time adult paying attention to them.\n\nWhy doesn't Mark want to parent his daughter at your wedding? You realize that she's becoming part of your life too, don't you? You're not just gaining a husband - you're getting a step-daughter too. It sounds to me like you want to pretend she doesn't exist.\n\nIt's clear why Alexis wants to attend the wedding - it's because she doesn't trust any of you lot to care for her daughter, and given the rather cavalier way you're describing your responsibilities towards a five year old child in this post, I can't blame her.\n\nYTA", ">has a daughter (5f) with her.

There will be birthdays, holidays, graduations, etc. Let her bring the child to the wedding and at least try to be gracious.", "YTA. \n\nIt would be cruel to not allow his daughter at his wedding - its not only your wedding. It is his, too. Your attitude of \"its all about me\" is NOT a good look and extremely selfish. Honestly? This should be a deal breaker for your husband - you are showing your true colors here in that you are willing to exclude his child rather than find an appropriate work around that will work for all parties.\n\nYour husband needs to get his attorney involved. There is no reason the ex should be at the wedding. An attorney should be able to deal with this situation through appropriate legal custody modifications (because this will not be the last time the child is weaponized by her mother).\n\nMaybe a compromise could be that the child's mom flies out with her and you guys hire a nanny exclusively to watch the daughter for the day so Mom feels comfortable and so daughter can participate fully. \n\nThere are options but you guys have to be willing to look at them instead of you throwing down \"ITS ALL ABOUT ME!!!!!!\"", "It sounds like your fianc\u00e9 doesn't have custody of his child. If so, his ex-wife doesn't have to let their daughter attend if she doesn't feel comfortable. The ex-wife seems to be the most levelheaded out of everyone. She's fine with her daughter attending but wants to be there to watch her. That's understandable if she and her daughter don't really know his side of the family well. I think she's actually making a fair compromise. I'm sure she doesn't want to be there either, but understands it's important to her ex-husband to have his daughter there. \n\nGrow up.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Who cares if his ex-wife is there? Of course his daughter should be at his wedding, and if it means his ex-wife has to he there, then that's fine. I get your concern but his daughter being there is worth the compromise of his ex-wife being there too. \n\nYou seem to think she has an alterior motive, but I don't think that's the case. I think she genuinely just wants to look out for her daughter, and for whatever reason, whether warranted or not, does not trust your fiance to take care of her.", "As the mother of a 5 year old myself, I'm wondering why the ex needs to be at the wedding.  It's a few hours and his mother said he would watch the child.  Is there a reason she wouldn't trust her child's own grandmother?  Does she ever allow her alone with the grandparents?  Or anyone else for that matter?  Demanding that you go to your ex's wedding is bizarre and feels like a power flex.  Denying the grandmother the opportunity to enjoy this special moment with her grandmother also feels possessive af.  Honestly I'm with you.  I'd accept it if no other alternatives were there, but demanding to attend this event feels shady and like she has an ulterior motive.  YWNBTA but I think you should do whatever it takes to make sure his daughter is there.", "YTA. If you were refusing to only let your fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex to be at the wedding, you would not be TA. But instead, you have made this about your soon to be step daughter. \n\nWho\u2019s the flower girl in your wedding, OP? Is it one of your nieces or nephews? \n\nYou aren\u2019t just marrying your fianc\u00e9. You\u2019re marrying his daughter. She\u2019s 5. If you are resentful towards a 5 year old for anything, much less existing, you need to seriously stop and reflect on yourself.\n\nYour future step daughter will soon be a big part of your family. Maybe if she were the flower girl, which is a very important role, your husband\u2019s ex would feel as though you saw her as being valued and protected at all times. \n\nHow much time have you spent with her? One on one? Girl time?\n\nLove her. Cherish her. Your life and love with your new husband will be blessed and fulfilled in so many ways if you do.", "Of course YTA. I already get how you feel towards her given that you refer her as \u201cthe child\u201d. She is HIS 5 year old child not some random kid. How else is she going to get there? You want her to travel alone 1/2 way across the country? She\u2019ll absolutely need to have her mother travel with her. You realize that this child will always be a part of his life, you maybe not with this attitude. Sounds like you\u2019d would just prefer her to disappear altogether. I\u2019d imagine that if he ever got full custody you\u2019d be working a plan to send her to boarding school.", "I feel like there are alternatives.

Because of the bad split I don't like her family, and because we live far away my 5 year old may not even remember the family on the wife's side. I don't care about who my ex-wife is marrying, but I am worried about my kid being thrown into a strange environment, with people they are probably not familiar with at a party where people (the new husbands side) will look at them and think of them as a mistake or black mark on a new in-law. I don't want to put my kid through that, blood does not automatically mean being comfortable around relatives.\n\nYou might have to bite the bullet on this one and invite the mother if you want the daughter there.", "Is there a reason the ex does not trust the family to look after her daughter? I can understand why she would be worried if her daughter had to be around basically strangers as she doesn't have alot of contact with them. \nIt's really not yr call here.

She is not saying the child cannot attend just that she needs to attend as well.\nLeaving yr stepdaughter out of yr wedding will have consequences with yr fiance, his child, his ex and the extended family.", "YTA.\n\nYou are not just marrying Mark but also his daughter.  You need to figure out how to have this wedding with his daughter in attendance.\n\nDoesn't Mark have any visitation?  Can't the wedding be when the daughter visits?", "Why are you reposting?", "I think this is a moment where you have to take one on the chin. \n\nThe ex has put YOU in an impossible position, so I'm not going to call you an AH, but unfortunately, you are going to look like one if you don't let the ex come so that his daughter can be in the wedding. \n\nThis is a setup, and I'm sorry about that. You and your fiance agreed no ex's at the wedding, and honestly, most people don't even need to agree to that because it is so obvious. But here you are. \n\nYou made arrangements for his daughter to be looked after at the wedding, so I think the ex is using this to create drama. Don't let her. Talk to your fiance and tell him to deal with his ex, and that he should be communicating with her that his daughter will be looked after at the wedding and should hold firm on that. At the end of the day though, if the choice is to have his daughter there with the ex or not at all, let him choose to have his daughter there. \n\nThen, you just have your team of friends and family ensure the ex isn't around you, you slap a smile on your face and you ignore her. You have been the bigger person, you have made it so his daughter is there, you take photos, including one with the ex in them (you don't need to pay for that one to be printed, you just do it to be nice). You play the lovely host. You know why? Because it doesn't hurt you to do it. You control how you feel on your wedding day, and you can choose not to let this woman drive a wedge between you and your fiance, on your wedding day. You do something nice for your fiance by ensuring his daughter is there. You do something nice for his daughter by welcoming her into your life and your big day. You take the power away from the ex by saying \"sure, you can come and celebrate my love, you don't scare me\" and then you act that way on your day.", "YTA. Because I read through the entire post and comments and not once did you reply to anyone asking what the Custody agreement was and why the ex doesn't trust your fiance's family etc etc. Those are the only details that will tilt the judgment in your favour. \n\nBut from what you've said, I'm going with YTA. it's not just your wedding, it's your fiance's wedding too.. it's important to him that he has his daughter there.. that's one big reason for you to compromise on this. Do it for your partner, if for no one else. Plus, given the fact that the split was not amicable, your fiance may be viewing this as an opportunity to smooth things over with the mother of his child (I'm assuming) and if you're in the way and things get even worse, that won't do your relationship any good. \n\nSecondly, stop viewing her as just \"fiance's ex\" and start viewing her as also your \"step daughter's mom\". Act with grace. If at all you're one day placed in her position, how would you want yourself and your kids to be treated..? You'll have to deal with this woman for a long time. The sooner you accept that, the better. \n\nDon't delude yourself into believing that grandma is a good option. Whatever the reason for the ex and your fiance having tensions may be, there's a huge chance the \"grandma\" is a part of it. Plus, we do not know how much time the grandma has spent around the daughter. Does she know her habits..? Does she know her allergies..? Are there anything specific they need to keep in mind so as to keep her daughter safe.. so many things can go wrong with a 5 year old and it's obvious the mom doesn't wanna risk it. \n\nBest option is to bite the bullet on this one and enjoy your wedding..", "YTA. Why can\u2019t she come with the daughter for the ceremony and leave after? A wedding reception isn\u2019t necessarily fun for a 5 year old. That way she and her dad get the memories and pictures without the hassle of anyone having to watch her during the reception.", "OP personally I would welcome the child and make her feel very special. I would outshine and be far more gracious than the mother at the wedding. I would let everybody in the room see that you are the superior person.  If you behave impeccably it should not bother you that the ex-wife is there.  Do it right and the ex-wife will feel foolish for being there.  \n\nBut please don't exclude the child; give her a roll and make her feel dressed up and pretty- the whole nine yards.  Additionally you could say something like after 8:00 p.m. or the time of your choosing children are not welcome when the drinking and dancing starts, and have the ex and the daughter go home (that's just a thought it has pros and cons).\n\nYour husband wants his daughter there; You can make that happen for him and for her.", "YTA! You have a wonderful opportunity to be gracious and welcoming to your new daughter and her mom. You keep saying it's about her failed relationship, wasn't your fiance also part of it? Yes, this is a frustrating situation but you seem intent on making sure this poor little girl doesn't attend. Kill them with kindness. \nAs a (step)mom who had the kids 24/7 and raised them, trust and believe I had to suck it up and welcome the she-devil into my home. I did it for MY children. They are adults now and love me even more putting their needs first.", "YTA she\u2019s trying to be there for her kid, you need to accept that you\u2019re marrying into this and are being petty. Do you realize that no one especially a groom is gonna watch a 5 year old well at a wedding? She shouldn\u2019t expect them to watch a 5 year old appropriately and she\u2019s doing you all a favor by being the one to do it so she can still be there and be out of your hair as 5 year olds are gonna need a lot of attention.  I get that you said \u201cmark\u2019s family\u201d but mark is the one responsible, if something happens and she\u2019s states away because family is drinking or trying to have a good time, if grandma is busy saying hi (damn near anything) a 5year old can get hurt or this kid can get into your wedding in ways you\u2019d wish she didn\u2019t. Does his family even know they were the plan when the mom was going to do it? By family it sounds like you expect people to kinda share responsibility while they\u2019re drinking and having a good time mingling. Which is shitty in itself. \n\nThe ex being there is a win win and no skin off your back as it helps you and mark. But seriously if she accidentally chugs a sweet alcoholic beverage someone leaves around it would lead to a lot of trouble for mark while she\u2019s states from her mom. You may not think about these things but as a mom it just makes sense what she\u2019s getting at\u2026.Your solution to this is to say his daughter shouldn\u2019t go and if that\u2019s the case I hope he doesn\u2019t marry you! sounds like he barley sees her as is and spends very few special days with her. This gives off vibes that you aren\u2019t willing to share these special days with his daughter because you see his ex as baggage and not a human being. Let this family heal and be there the best they can for this kid, clearly they\u2019re done but they share a kid who\u2019s gonna need that.\n\nETA grandma can be as lovely as you say but states away you don\u2019t know how quick she is with a 5 year old, nor do you understand how different taking a kid for a night is than to a wedding. She\u2019s basically still toddler like at 5 and I know I\u2019m not trusting grandma at a wedding states away to keep mine safe.", "YTA - You\u2019re acting like you\u2019re never going to have to look at your fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex ever again after you get married. \n\nYou haven\u2019t said otherwise that the ex is still in love with your fianc\u00e9 or something similar to her potentially ruining the wedding. If anything, the ex has a very valid point to be cautious with letting her child go alone where there is tensions.", "Yes", "I don't see why EX needs to be at the wedding.\n\nThe girl's paternal grandmother will be taking care of her, which is a great opportunity for the two of them to spend time together.\n\nThe EX is free to get a hotel room nearby to be in the vicinity, but no way in HELL does she need to attend the wedding.\n\nNTA", "I am \ud83d\udcaf on your side.

For the sake of the 5f, I could see her not being very comfortable around family she doesn\u2019t see as much and her parent will be less available because they will be busy getting MARRIED (congrats) that day. For that reason i might understand she wants to make sure her daughter feels comfortable. I think ex is being the AH for insisting that she come along. If she really wanted their daughter to be comfy, she might come a day or two early to help 5f warm up to the other relatives that will be looking out for her and maybe even establish some rules or advice for what 5f is used to in terms of routines etc. Ex sounds a bit controlling maybe? Unless there is some history of abuse or neglect from his side?\n\nTLDR: NTA for not wanting the ex there. Kind of the AH for not trying to think of creative ways for the daughter to be there and empathizing with any legit concerns there may be.", "Soft YWBTA because this is his daughter. Yes, his ex sounds awful. Especially because she is holding his daughter basically for ransom in this case. You're not wrong for not wanting her at the wedding.\n\nLook at it this way, if you let her come, you will be able to flaunt you are the bigger person and that you aren't going to let her bother you. And it will mean a lot to your fiance to have his daughter there.", "NTA but Wow there are some ridiculous comments here. The main issue here is what is your fianc\u00e9s custody agreement? If he doesn\u2019t have one then he needs one. Because if he had legal custody then he could get his child for the wedding during his custody time and it wouldn\u2019t be up to the biomom whether she comes or not. But it doesn\u2019t sound like he has custody and it sounds like your wedding date is already planned so I\u2019m not sure what your options now are. If you could go back in time though I\u2019d tell you to have fianc\u00e9 get a custody order in place before planning the wedding. I 100% agree with you on not wanting the ex at your wedding and it IS ridiculous that she insists on being there. Although I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned how much time your fianc\u00e9 has spent with his child in the past, but if he hasn\u2019t spend much time with her then I could understand biomom having trust issues regarding child\u2019s care. But for those saying the dad would have to watch the child at the wedding, have none of you alls parents ever watched you kid for you? Geez. Lots of parents get married with their kids in attendance and have family members help watch the kids! I\u2019m blown away by people acting like that\u2019s such a preposterous idea.

Mark was previously married to a woman named Alexis and has a daughter (5f) with her. They did not have a very amicable split and even after a few years there is still some tension between them. Mark has asked that his daughter be able to attend the wedding as it is understandably very important to him.\n\nThe issue is they live several states away from us and Alexis will not allow her daughter to attend if she is not able to attend the wedding with her. She does not trust Mark's family to watch her and insists she needs to be able to keep an eye out herself. Mark is on board with her attending, but this is a firm no for me as this is my first marriage and the last thing I want is to look out at my wedding to see my new husbands ex-wife.\n\nI don't know if she is making this about the child or her failed relationship, but I have no idea why she would even want to attend her ex-husbands wedding. I do not want his ex there under any circumstances and I fear this will cause some resentment if his daughter does not attend. \n\nWIBTA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But someone is going to have to make way in this case, because it's either the daughter attends with her mother, your fiance's ex, or the daughter does not attend at all. Those are the choices, and it sounds like there isn't a compromise available. So you'll have to decide which is going to be more important in the long run. You know he was married already. On your wedding day, he'll be marrying *you*. The day will be yours no matter what. Keep that in mind and you'll be fine.\n\nWere I you I would hold my nose and allow the ex to attend. Not *invite* her, mind you, but *allow* her. It's a tiny semantic difference, but if you hold it in your mind that you are *allowing* her presence, rather than requesting the honor of her presence, for the sake of your soon-to-be-husband and your soon-to-be-stepdaughter, then you're the one who comes out shining even more brightly on your wedding day. You don't even need to send an invitation, just tell your fiance to inform her that she may attend.\n\nAnd then pay no attention to her at the wedding. During the ceremony you'll be thinking of your new husband (or you should be), and during the reception you'll be busy with your other guests. You don't need to mingle with his ex, include her in even a single photograph, or look in her direction. You can arrange the seating chart so she's not in your line of vision. You can show the photographer her picture and the seating chart, and tell them to be sure to NOT take any photos of her at the reception. You have a lot of control over how you handle this, but handling it by excluding your fiance's daughter is likely to hurt them both and adversely affect your relationship with them.

Let the ex come to the place of the wedding (I mean the city/state) but instead of physically attending it, let her leave the physical attendance to the nanny. Get her a room nearby where she can wait in case of emergencies and also be able to physically drop off and pick up the daughter. Give her the choice of whom to hire as nanny and ask your fiance to meet that expense. I don't know how well off you both are, but this seems like the second best option.

Because what if their daughter WANTS her mom there? You said yourself, since his ex has full custody, she takes care of her more than your fiance does. Does he spend any other time with his daughter besides summers (and is it the whole summer or part of the summer)? \n\nBecause when kids are involved, what you want isn't the only thing that matters. As much as that sucks for you, it's a situation that you now need to sit down with your fianc\u00e9 AND his ex to figure out together. You'll be a family unit, whether you like it or not. Not that you shouldn't have some say, but it's just more complicated than having it be a day about just you and your fianc\u00e9, because he DOES have a kid and she is involved in every decision you two make from now on, regardless how much or how little he sees her.", "Could you pay for a room for the ex at the venue, have her grandmother look after the child at the wedding, and if she wants her mom, she will be in the building?", "Fair enough but she implied she has the time to go to the wedding.

But I dunno, if there\u2019s anyway to postpone the wedding to give fianc\u00e9 time to get a legal custody agreement in place I\u2019d do that. Or try to take it to court to get at least a legal agreement for the child to attend the wedding without mom. But getting a legal agreement is probably going to be what fianc\u00e9 needs to do at some point if he doesn\u2019t want biomom dictating his time with his child. He has rights to his own child too, he just needs to exercise those rights. I know that can be more difficult being in the military though and I won\u2019t pretend to understand how that complicates things. But I\u2019m married to a man now who had a 5 year old when we got married and he already had established 50% custody of his child but he\u2019s had to assert his boundaries about parenting to biomom before and it just sounds like that\u2019s really what your fianc\u00e9 needs to do.

Frankly the focus on the perfect all about me day versus the lack of understanding of what marriage to someone with a child means makes you unprepared for what this marriage is going to actually involve to begin with.\n\nShe is 5, I don\u2019t know one 5 year old that would not be stressed out and upset being at an event with a lot of people, even family members, that she is not used to being around. Add to that she will be in a strange likely over stimulating environment without a parent by her side most of the time and you are asking for a meltdown . A meltdown which would likely be more disruptive then the ex being there to begin with. You indicated her fathers primary role in your eyes is to be the groom, not his daughter caretaker, so who does that leave if not her mom.\n\nGrandma is not the option you suggested, unless she has a close relationship with this child, and nothing indicates she does. To make matters worse does not seem like grandma or other family members see this child a lot since she lives several states away. They are going to be in her face trying to pick her up, kiss and hug her basically smother her with love, and while that is understandable as she is an extension of someone they love, to her it is a bunch of strangers/ vaguely familiar people invading her space. How terrifying for a child.\n\nYou assume that they ex is insisting she attends with her child to mess with you, but nowhere in your posts have you indicated she has ever done so in the past. So why would she now? She is voluntarily signing up to watch the father of her child marry another woman in a room full of people that she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with,who be sending her negative vibes while showing you and her ex nothing but love and wishes for happiness.  She seems to be putting her feelings and well being aside to support her daughter so she will be comfortable and safe, making attending her father\u2019s big day a happy time, not a potentially traumatizing one.\n\nUnless you have not shared vital information about her being a nightmare ex-spouse who is having trouble letting go, she just sounds like a good mom.  They way you at no point considered your future daughter in-laws feelings, rather just talk about the logistics of who is going to handle her during the wedding, and don\u2019t prioritize your husbands feelings about the inclusion of his child in his wedding above you being uncomfortable with not being 100% the center of attention is troubling.\n\nThis day is in fact not just about you being a bride, but you becoming a wife and stepmom as well. This post and your responses to comments makes me think you are not going to be a good stepmother, and gives me an understanding of why this child mother my be concerned that no one will looking out for her daughter at this wedding.\n\nYTA", "It\u2019s his daughter make it work. Sounds like you don\u2019t want her there to take away from\u201dyour day\u201d.", "YTA. The daughter is 5. That is a reasonable request. You chose to marry someone with a kid and unfortunately there are things that come with it whether you like it or not.", "ESH.  Sorry but you are marrying someone who has been married before.  I probably wouldn\u2019t want to see that person at my wedding either, but she\u2019s forcing your hand.  She sucks so much for either wanting to stir up trouble because she knows you don\u2019t want her there or wants to be there because she still has some sort of feelings.  (My husband\u2019s ex wife was the latter).  If you don\u2019t give in, she will paint y\u2019all into such a small corner on when, where, and how you will get to spend time with his daughter.  I can only see a few options of how this will go:\n\n1.  Ex comes to the wedding with daughter, but it makes you uncomfortable (dad is happy and ex is as happy as she will be)\n2. Ex doesn\u2019t allow daughter to come to your wedding and husband is sad his daughter isn\u2019t there (more fuel to their dislike for each other that could cause difficulties in the future with visitation and he resents your part in it)\n3.  Husband decides that if you can\u2019t just allow ex to come to the wedding so daughter can be there, that you don\u2019t place his wants/needs high enough on the list of priorities.  He then cancels the wedding.  You lose.", "The child is 5 years old, not an infant or toddler. Mom should not be in attendance for the wedding.", "She can't insist on that.

If he doesn't have a formal agreement you shouldn't marry him.", "NTA it's completely reasonable", "Info: Is there a legitimate reason mom can't trust dad's family? Do they badmouth her to the girl? Alcohol or other problems? Grandma isn't okay to mind a little kid? Is this (does NOT sound like, but would explain mom's attitude) a marriage to an affair partner? Unless it's something like that, NTA. Unpopular opinion but it could just be mom messing with dad.", "NTA. The ex is clearly doing a power play. Also, your fianc\u00e9 needs to fight for an actual custody agreement. Being a doormat to the ex isn\u2019t helping him. He\u2019s military yes, but he still has rights to his kid. He should fight for them.\n\nDrag the ex to court and ask the judge if the daughter can come to the wedding without mom. That\u2019s the only way everyone gets what they want here.\n\nAlternatively, you can ask if there\u2019s someone (besides her father, he\u2019ll be getting married and too busy) she\u2019d prefer to watch the daughter while the daughter is at the wedding. My guess is the ex won\u2019t bend. \n\nYou offered a perfectly reasonable solution to the issue. Ex refused. Therefore, ex is the problem with not being flexible.", "Why can\u2019t his own family sit with his child? His parents? Does anyone in his family even know his child?

Ex attending is a deal breaker. don't back down.  be strong. you got this", "> Why doesn't Mark want to parent his daughter at your wedding?\n\nI generally agree with your overall comment but I think it's pretty obvious why the groom wouldn't be able to give his child the attention/supervision they need at his own wedding", "OP has repeatedly said she just doesn't want her husband's ex at the wedding, which I think is a fair ask.", "Because the OP owes every commenter a personal response \ud83d\ude44", "When I was 7, my paternal grandma had to babysit me for a day. I don't recall the whys, but I know both of my parents were working and my maternal grandma, who usually babysat me, wasn't available for some reason that day. I wasn't that close with my paternal grandma, because she was living the other side of town and my parents weren't as close with her, but we'd visit her every 2 months or so, for all my life.  Plus, she'd been knitting lovely pieces of clothing for me that I dearly loved, she was there for every party, whether it was a birthday, a holiday, etc. So I knew her fairly well, just not that intimately.\n\nOn that day, there was a a big thunderstorm outside. I got scared because of the storm, her apartment was on the 15th floor and I wasn't use to storms from that height. Because we were not this intimate, she tried to reassure and soothe me, but in vain. That day remains in my memories and my family's as the day I was sent by EMTs to the ER for my first asthma attack. \n\n30 years later, I still remember this day like yesterday, and think about it every time I need to use my inhaler. Definitely not a bonding time with my grandmother; if anything, for years, I didn't want to spend time with her anymore, as I was scared. On the other hand, I guess this experience did created bonding experiences with therapists with whom I was addressing my anxiety. \n\nAll of that to say, putting a young kid with a relative they don't know well in an unusual and scary environment is not the way to go for bonding experience between them...", "Is the ex though?
