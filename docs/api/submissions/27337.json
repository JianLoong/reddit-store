Your baby is 5 months old and fragile af.  Do they expect you to just be like \"yeah sure, stranger.  The curiosity of your dog takes priority over the safety of my human baby\"?  Idgaf if someone's dog is curious.  Your baby was NOT curious and these interactions should be mutual.  As her parent and protector it's your right to make sure nothing bad happens to her.  NTA, OP.   You did what was right!", "NTA, but just wondering why you grabbed the dog instead of the baby? If you couldn't get to the baby, the only choice you had was to move the dog and that's not unreasonable.  You wouldn't have any way of knowing if the dog was friendly or aggressive. Maybe yelling was overreacting, but it sounds like the dog owner started it.", "As a dog owner, and a kid owner. Keep your dog leashed and away from kids. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re the asshole for letting their dog go up to your kid without permission", "NTA. I don\u2019t know that you needed to resort to the cussing him out but your instincts were good. You don\u2019t know that dog, you don\u2019t know if it could be dangerous to your child\u2019s  life. Dog owners need to understand that their dog is not beloved to stranger in the same way your child would not have been welcome to wander over to a random picnicers and start touching and drooling on them.", "Absolutely NTA. Your baby's safety is most important. That dog owner was a complete idiot for letting it near your child. Screw those friends defending him.", "NTA - the dog owner should have kept his dog closer, off your blanket, and away from your kid. I take my dog places all the time and all she wants to do is get loved on and sniff around. But guess what? I keep her right by me because unless we\u2019re at my house she doesn\u2019t have full reign to do whatever she wants. How is anyone other than me supposed to know she\u2019s nice and gentle? How are they supposed to know that the last thing she\u2019d eat is poop or a dead animal? They don\u2019t, and they don\u2019t have to because my dog won\u2019t be in their space uninvited. The owner was a total AH.", "NTA. The dog might have been curious and harmless, but he had no idea if your child was allergic, if your child had any issues with animals or any myriad of issues. He had no idea if your child would strike out at the dog, which could have resulted in the dog taking off or retaliating.  He was a complete AH.", "NTA. The fact that this person apparently has no issues with understanding boundaries when it comes to you touching his dog but not when it comes to his dog touching your kid is pretty impressive. While, sure, you could probably have handled it more calmly, it never should have been an issue in the first place.", "NTA - Even though the dog was leashed, the owner was not in control if the dog was on your blanket.", "NTA - The owner was an A H and instead of accepting responsibly, decided to lay the blame on you. How much easier had he said, \"Sorry, man. I'll keep the dog away from your baby.\"", "NTA, the iwner let a dog on a leash get on your blanket. Thatsy not okay. He olso let a dog sniff a kid without asking - major red flag. What would happen if your kid decided to pull his whiskers or what not? He is 5months old, he doesn't know better. The owner is a moron\n\nFor people who claim he should've grabbed the baby. As a dog owner - never do this. Instincts kick in if prey gets away fast, be it a kid you grab or your small dog you walk. The dogs get aggressive if you pick up baby / pet. \n\nGrabbing a dog has a danger is being bitten but it's better to be bitten that to have baby mauled.", "Going NTA, while i think you may have over reacted a bit it is better to overreact rather than have potential harm. It is also a major asshole move to not have control over your pet.", "NTA.\n\nRegarding the leash: A dog technically on a leash, but with enough slack to go up to other people, is the same as a dog NOT on a leash.", "NTA, I own two pitties and would rather keep a distance from others. No excuse for a dog to be that close to a child. They know the dog is harmless, but you don't. Good call on protecting your child!", "NTA\n\nI'd guess there was a leash requirement that he was casually ignoring. Plenty of entitled dog owners do that. \n\nYou need to protect your child. You have no idea what that dog is like. You have no idea if your kid might suddenly flail his arms, smack it in the nose, and provoke an attack. Etc.", "NTA\n\nThe blanket was your perimeter, as soon as the dog was on the blanket, it was a problem.  Dog owners sometimes just love their doggie so much they don't understand some people don't want the dog close to them, friendly or not.", "NTA\n\nYou're protecting your child from a dog you don't know.  He's an asshole for letting his dog wander in public.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of insane person would take a dog to an event and then allow the dog to get near enough to sniff someone\u2019s infant? It\u2019s mind boggling the number of people who take dogs places and then let them go right up to people. It\u2019s crazy.", "I\u2019m both a parent AND a dog owner. I still say NTA.

Dog owner obviously isn't a parent.", "NTA of course you're going to protect your child. That's the natural instinct of any parent.", "I love dogs and labs are pretty safe around babies.  That said, you always need to watch dogs around babies, especially larger dogs and even more especially ones that are not familiar with you or the baby. Literally anything can go wrong.\n\nNTA.  That owner should have been much more careful with the dog and realise that while he may know how his dog will react in unusual situations, not only was this situation unfamiliar for the dog (strangers), other people do not have to accept as fact that the dog would not have done anything.", "Dog owner here, you are NTA, the owner is, though.", "NTA by a mile!   Dog was leashed and owner allowed it to walk on your space and get close to a baby?  WTF.

The dog's owner should have been apologizing profusely.  Your anger was likely based on his nonchalant attitude.", "NTA, this guy shouldn\u2019t be allowed to own a dog", "I would have grabbed your child. You had no way to know if the dog was friendly. AH, no. I understand in the moment it's tough to think that quickly, but you should not have touched his dog.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong, including grabbing the dog -- better to pull the dog away from the baby then grab the baby and have the dog lunge.\n\nMy village had to ban dogs at our summer concert series because of situations like this; too many people who brought dogs and thought because they were on a leash they didn't have to pay attention to them.\n\nAfter a few close calls like the situation you're describing they just outright banned dogs, because they couldn't trust dog owners to adequately assess if their dog was well trained enough to be at a busy public event without bothering other parties.\n\nEven the nicest dogs get overwhelmed or surprised and react in ways you don't expect; you can't let your dog run up to strange babies, and you certainly shouldn't get upset when people react strongly to that happening.", "ESH.

Owner had no leg to stand on, he should have apologized and moved on.\n\nYour baby is on a blanket on the ground and you don't even notice a huge dog coming around until it's right on top of your kid?  Pay better attention, as a start. Grabbing the dog was fine, but then making a scene and flipping out on this guy was pointless and disruptive to everyone else hanging out for a chill time.  Other neighbors who didn't even know what happened think you're both assholes.", "ESH. Jumping up and grabbing a dog on a leash without saying anything is crazy, you could have self-fulfilled that prophecy by scaring the shit out of the dog.\n\nDog owner shouldn't have let it approach without asking, you shouldn't have let the dog get so close in the first place without noticing, you definitely shouldn't have rushed a strange dog near your baby with no warning.", "Info: Is there a reason you grabbed the dog, and not your child?\n\nWithout knowing anything about the situation, or the dog (did it get off leash accidently or on purpose, is it friendly), just grabbing and pulling someone's dog might cause concern for the owners.\n\nIn the reverse situation; if your child ran up to someone's dog, would you want them to grab your child, or grab their dog to pull them away?\n\nNTA for wanting to keep your child safe, but I don't think it needed to be taken to a place of you screaming and cursing at him in public.", "ESH \n\nYou WAY overreacted. There was no need to cause a scene and be a jerk. If you are going to go to public events in public park, you should have an expectation of running into the public and their dogs. \n\nThe other guy should have had a better hold on his dog.", "ESH, the dog was on a leash and you could have just picked the baby up instead of manhandling the mutt. Y'all both could have handled this situation way better.", "NTA the person who doesn't have their dog on a leash and in their control is always the AH in these situations. Emphasis on in their control. Why would he have a dog on a leash and let it go sniff a baby?", "Your instincts were correct in that you don't want some random dog coming over to you infant.  However, your response was a bit too aggressive.\n\nThe dog owner should understand that their dog isn't entitled to go wherever they want and that not everyone want his dog around them.\n\nAren't there leash laws in your area?

Rule of thumb- if you wouldn\u2019t do something- don\u2019t let your dog/child do said thing.", "NTA. you didn't need to cuss him out but your instincts were right. the fact that the dog was leashed makes it even worse imo because it means the owner was allowing the dog to get close to anyone even though any of the people could easily be deathly allergic to dogs. plus, you never know how a dog is going to react in a situation, doesn't matter if it's usually friendly, it could easily turn aggressive no matter what the owner says.", "Yta if you were so worried about your kid, why didn't you grab the baby?  Your reaction is why yta.

At least they were leashed, but it's still not okay cuz ofc you don't know if they're truly friendly or not and it's a BABY, you don't want to ever risk it esp if it's a stranger!!!!!!!  I hate people like that, truly irresponsible and shouldn't own dogs.  Glad your baby is okay, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nA dog owner needs to be cognizant of their pet and what it\u2019s doing, just like a parent.

You could have taken your baby and then spoken to the dog owner, who shouldn't have let his dog get near a baby without parental permission.", "ESH\n\nSo, I appreciate that all dogs have the potential to be baby-killing machines but let\u2019s be real, most aren\u2019t and living life as though they could be is a manifestation of anxiety that is not conducive to living in a world where dogs are the #1 pet. \n\nNow, should he have let his dog near your baby? Of course not. But you took your baby to a busy public park party and then sat in a chair and left the baby on the ground beside you. The odds of something \u201cpotentially dangerous\u201d approaching your child\u2019s personal space without spotting it early were very high. \n\nAt this point, you\u2019re all N A H.

He told me he has a permit to be on this damn beach and can do whatever he wants.\n\nI immediately walked back to 2 policemen and told him about the dog and his reply.

You were the one who said \"how could it be handled more tactfully\" and now you're saying \"handling it tactfully is someone else's responsibility.\"", "Lots of reasons like some could trip over it, or kick a ball and hit the baby. Something falls or blows over the baby could eat.

Something happening to something you leave on the ground at a busy park only requires that normal park things happens.

This is a lack of decency and respect from the dog owner.", "Nope. If a stranger let's their leashed dog go on another person's blanket to sniff someone's baby because their dog is curious they will have to deal with the fallout from their own stupidity and do not get to complain if someone's reaction is less than positive.

He doesn't owe it to the dog owner who isn't watching their dog carefully enough. \n\nHonestly, I feel like the way everyone is focusing on OP's sitting position is kinda silly in this case.

Then if it gets aggressive you boot it hard enough to make some space. *Then* you mace the dog.", "OP was right there.  It\u2019s not like he walked away from the kid for a second.  Expecting parents to stare at their kid the whole time is absurd.  \n\nThe blame is entirely on the dog owner.", "Yes. It's a thing that happens because dog owners are sometimes irresponsible with their dogs. It's wise to be on the watch for these types of people, but that doesn't make them somehow not responsible for the situation they created.", "For one it\u2019s a common phrase Maybe not a victim but setting up to blame the parents if something did happen.", "So your dog understands the difference of grass and blankets?\n\nWhy is it expected that the dog owner should be 100% responsible for every second of what their dog is doing, but OP has no blame or responsibility for watching his child?

No. Should people have their babies on blankets not watching their surroundings? Also no.\n\nBoth are at fault IMO.", "So you're saying it would be perfectly acceptable if a group of rowdy children trampled the blanket and stepped on the baby? Or an adult running after a runaway frisbee not noticing the baby on the ground by itself, an accidentally kicking it?\n\nYeah, I'm not saying the dog owner should not have been more diligent, but I think this is also a learning lesson for OP not to have the baby on the ground at a busy event", "Well your username checks out \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\u201ca dog wandering up to sniff someone's very young child is only a \"normal park thing\" in the sense that people being irresponsible and putting other people at risk is a \"normal park thing.\"\u201d\n\nOh 100% agreed.

I don\u2019t have dogs or kids and even I could predict that happening. \n\nI also, to be honest, don\u2019t think it\u2019s responsible to leave your baby on the ground in this context. I\u2019d say that in a perfect world you could do that and nothing would happen, but the whole point is we don\u2019t live in a perfect world.\n\nI agree it doesn\u2019t materially change much in that I don\u2019t really think either party is really guilty of much. But in my view both OP and the owner were responsible for a lapse of attention and forethought concerning their charges and how they chose to be in a busy park. They both failed in the same way to an extent that falls well within the human capacity for error.\n\nIMO, anyhow!", "I wouldn\u2019t put my kid on the ground on a blanket at a public event and not be watching.

I just really don\u2019t feel it was wise to leave a baby on the ground in that context. \n\nThis to me does not absolve the dog owner, it just means they both had a lapse and it resulted in a completely predictable outcome.", "The dog owner is responsible for every second of what their dog is doing because it\u2019s their dog.", "Because the baby is not endangering anyone yet the dog is capable of serously injuring or killing someone.

But no, that's not what I'm saying.\n\nIt is perhaps a good learning opportunity for OP, since it's always good to be better prepared for bad actors or otherwise irresponsible people around your children. But being a little unwise in the exact configuration of how he was sitting doesn't make him in the wrong in this interaction.\n\nI mean, it likely wouldn't have made a difference in this scenario anyway, since the dog owner seemed fine letting their dog go up to random people.

Especially if he was sitting at my feet.", "Was the dog owner really okay with their dog going up to random people? Or was the start of this encounter a stranger grabbing their dog and pulling them, and then yelling at them?\n\nSure, maybe it's irresponsible dog owners, or maybe just like how OP had a moment where he wasn't watching the baby, they had a moment where they weren't watching their dog. It's Human Nature when you see someone being aggressive to try to calm down the situation, just like OP instinctively grabbed the dog instead of grabbing the baby, I'm sure the dog owners were trying to deescalate things by saying \"its ok, dog is friendly, he wouldn't hurt anyone, please don't grab them\" because this person is grabbing and probably aggressively moving their dog, and then causing a scene and yelling at them.", ">Sure, maybe it's irresponsible dog owners, or maybe just like how OP had a moment where he wasn't watching the baby\n\nThe issue with your comments on this thread is that you've got this weird idea that OP is somehow responsible for the actions of this dog. A baby *should* be able to be on the ground without random dogs sniffing them. It *was* the negligence (intentional or otherwise) of the dog owner that created this situation.\n\nThe location of the child only affects how quickly OP was able to remedy the situation, not who created it.\n\n> I'm sure the dog owners were trying to deescalate things by saying \"its ok, dog is friendly, he wouldn't hurt anyone, please don't grab them\"\n\nConsidering how little even *you* seem to be willing to recognize that the dog owner was in the wrong here, I don't know that I believe your assessment of the owner's meaning here. My interpretation is much more straightforward, namely that the dog owner didn't think it was wrong that he let his dog go up and sniff some random child. \n\nIf he really wanted to deescalate the situation, the correct response would be \"I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have let my dog get so close!\"\n\nIt's not OP's responsibility to control other people's animals."]}
