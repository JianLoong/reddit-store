Max is married and has two kids with his wife. Troy has been dating Anna (30s) for 2 years and Anna has a son (7M) with her ex boyfriend.\n\nEver since Troy has been seeing Anna, I, my husband, my other brother, and our parents all thought Troy was allowing himself to get walked all over by her. For background, Troy cannot have children so he was really happy to be dating Anna because he gets to have a somewhat father like relationship with her son. We are all extremely happy that he has stepped into this role for Anna\u2019s son and we all adore him and my kids even consider him a cousin now. But the only issue is that Anna uses her son as a weapon against my brother for financial purposes and this week has just been another one of those situations.\n\nAnna and her son live completely rent free in Troy\u2019s house and he even pays for Anna\u2019s sons expenses for things like extracurriculars and school supplies when he can. Although I don\u2019t personally think he should be doing this since they\u2019re not even married, I keep quiet because again, it\u2019s his life not mine and he can do as he wishes. The reason think this is because Anna receives $3,000 in child support every month from her ex and she basically spends all of it on herself and expects my brother to handle all of her son\u2019s expenses.\n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where my brother is now pulling from his own savings to pay for her son and has come asking my husband and I for some money to pay for expensive sports equipment for Anna\u2019s son because he can\u2019t afford it anymore. We said no because Anna can more than easily afford to pay for her own kid considering how much she gets in child support and is instead using him and now they want to use me. Anna immediately called me freaking out saying that I help my biological nieces (daughters of my other brother Max) with their expenses sometimes and I\u2019m just penalizing her son because he\u2019s not actually my brothers kid.\n\nI absolutely lost it on her because I KNOW she has the money to take care of her own son yet she is leeching off of my brother and wants to pull the \u201cbiological child\u201d discrimination card of me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH, but some of my friends have been saying that it seems unfair I only help my biological nieces but not Anna\u2019s child. The thing is, I would feel more inclined to help my brother if Anna wasn\u2019t mismanaging funds and was actually in need.", "created_utc": 1682819840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133cz2o/aita_for_not_wanting_to_support_my_brothers_step/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is her child, not yours. You\u2019re not responsible in any way whatsoever for said child. She sounds like a leech. An entitled one. The audacity of her to scream at you for not financially supporting HER child, is absolutely insane. I understand we\u2019re just getting one side of the story, but based on what you\u2019re saying, I feel bad for your brother and I hope he sees the light before she absolutely drains him financially.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to give anyone anything. Your mistake was giving a reason why.", "NTA! Your brothers being financially abused and needs help. If they were both struggling it sounds like you\u2019d be willing to help, same as your other nieces and nephews.", "NTA. You get to do with your money exactly as you wish. Why would anyone be entitled to it? It's a tough spot for you to be in for sure and I hope this doesn't ruin your relationship with your brother. But if it does, it's his gf'd fault, not yours.  I do think maybe you can't judge what she is doing with her money. I think generally we don't know enough about another person's personal finances to judge in that way, but maybe you do know. Either way, you don't owe her anything.", "NTA it's YOUR money YOU choose how to spend it. If you don't want to support this leech then it's not your place to", "NTA. Both your brother and his partner are mismanaging funds. If he has a full time income and she has $3000 in child support plus her own wage if she works, it should never get to the point where they need assistance for one child's extra curricular activities and if it did get to that point and she doesn't work, she should get a job. \n\nHow you distribute your money is entirely dependent on you - who you think needs it, who is legitimately struggling more etc. Whatever your reasons, these do not have to be justified to whoever your brother is dating. That's ridiculous. It's also shameless on her behalf. They're not homeless andnl hungry, she just chooses to invest in non necessities all month. Her problem.", "NTA! AT ALL!! I mean they are not married, he is not legally your nephew so why does anna think she can pull the \u201c biological child\u201d card?? The entitlement.", "NTA. Sounds like your brother is in a bit of an abusive relationship and definitely being used for his money. Sad for him, but doesn't mean you have to fund her kid because she wants to spend her kids money on herself!? Maybe try and have a one on one chat with your brother about the situation?", "NTA you have rubbish friends, dispose of them responsibly", "NTA \n\nThey aren't married and you are not obligated to fork out any money for anyone.\n\nHope your brother gets out of this trap, I mean relationship.", "INFO: Since you want to go into finances, what is your brother's financial situation and what kind of financial support do you provide to your biological nieces?", "INFO - How do you know what she spends the child support on?", "NTA. Your money, you spend it how you want.  The son is also not legally a nephew for you, so I don\u2019t feel like there should be an obligation to help either.  I would have probably asked her where her $3,000 is to contribute to her kids expenses since the father would have to do half probably.  If you wanted to get real petty, you could tip off the father and be like ask for a reduction in child support because she isn\u2019t spending it on the kid.", "NTA: I don\u2019t care if the boy was your biological nephew, that still doesn\u2019t give him or his mother a right to your money. Whatever financial support you choose to give or not give is your choice and your right, regardless of your reasons.

Your brother needs to grow a spine. NTA", "Why do people want to blow so much ridiculous money they don't have on kids sports? The kid is seven. NTA. If your brother can't afford whatever it is, the kid doesn't need it. Anna is a leech. Your brother needs to wise up.", "Based on the information post I am leaning towards N T A, but I have a few questions. Ultimately, at the end of the day it is your money, but sometimes the reasons for who you choose to help and not help can make you look bad:\n\n1: 3000$ is an exuberant amount of child support to the point that it seems unrealistic. Her ex would need to be making over $100,000. Where did you find out this is how much she receives?\n2: You mentioned her spending all of the child support money on things for herself. What kinds of things are you seeing that she has bought for herself with that money?\n3: Did HE say he couldn\u2019t afford it anymore, or was he just asking for help and that was the presumed reason?\n\nETA: Based on OPs response, absolutely NTA. I think now may be a good time to speak up. You have been a good sister holding your tongue and not telling him how to live his life, but now all signs are pointing to this becoming a serious problem for him.", "Well I always see things a different way. You are not the asshole. But.\nAt the center of this is a child. Seven years old. And right next to this child is your brother whom you care about. Your brother loves this kid. If this were about helping Anna, I'd say fuck her. But it's the kid and it's your brother. If you don't wanna help, you aren't compelled to help. But if you would help if only the kid's mom wasn't awful...then the kid is paying the price for all of his mom's faults. \n\nThis is not your responsibility. You are not the asshole. But. \n\nSometimes I think this sub confuses me. Like, so many times people are justified in their decisions but is being justified - is *not* being an asshole the only thing at stake?\n\nI dunno. I just feel for the kid. If there is any chance the kid gets wind of his mom's interpretation of events, it will be painful for him.\n\nI'm sorry you are all in this situation. Not fun watching a family member get snowed, especially when there is a child involved.", "NTA.", "Nta", "NTA. It is your money and you have the right to decide how to spend it. Is it a little bit mean not to give some money to your brother, maybe, but it really seems like Anna is taking advantage of the situation.", "NTA", "NTA.  She can spend less on her \u201clifestyle\u201d and provide for her child.  She can spend her money as she sees fit as can you.  Your brother needs to call her bluff.", "NTA Anna is a gold digger and now your brother wants YOU to finance her too? That\u2019s just ridiculous.", "NTA. Your last sentence said it. It's not about the biology. It's about her selfish spending.", "NTA. Someone needs to cut Anna off otherwise the cycle won\u2019t stop. Apparently it\u2019s going to be you, not your brother. From your comments it sounds like a totally different situation from your other brother\u2019s kids.", "My brother makes enough money to support himself well, but it\u2019s been difficult for him to have to also support Anna and her son. This is my issue because Anna receives child support from her ex for her son\u2019s expenses but instead pockets the money for herself. For my nieces, I pay for both of their extracurricular activities which they do with my daughter because my brother and his wife cannot afford it at all.", "My brother has told me multiple times that she doesn\u2019t use it on her son and instead pockets it for herself. So he feels responsible in taking care of her son since he knows she won\u2019t do it", "1) Anna\u2019s ex is a doctor. I don\u2019t know how much his salary is, but from what my brother has told me, he has done extremely well for himself and doesn\u2019t have any other children and is unmarried so he has more money for child support. This was all told to me by Troy himself.\n\n2) Anna recently bought a brand new luxury car which was way out of both her and my brother\u2019s price range and when asked about it, she admitted that she had saved up multiple months of the money her ex gives her for it. There have been other instances of events like this happening where she has saved up the child support to buy herself a luxury item and my brother and her have had a lot of issues over it in their relationship.\n\n3) Yes, Troy specifically said he could not afford to pay for Anna\u2019s son expenses on his own anymore and needs the financial help because Anna doesn\u2019t want to chip in. My brother now considers Anna\u2019s son like his own so for him he feels obligated to support even though it\u2019s not his child.", "Okay I was just curious on it. That seems legit. Going with NTA then\n \nThe problem isn't that he's not your brothers kid, the problem is with her and that child support. If she'd spend it right and still need help, sounds like you'd be happy to lend an occasional assist like you do your other brother", "Oh my goodness, your poor brother. Please stop biting your tongue and try to talk to your brother! This vampire is gonna bleed him dry! He needs an intervention."]}
