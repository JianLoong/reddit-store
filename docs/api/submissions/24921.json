You agreed to deliver the furniture. You have given her multiple dates and times. You've cancelled or rearranged multiple times. I get you have other priorities as well, but if you couldn't make the delivery then you should never have agree to it in the first place. She sucks because the stuff *is* free so she shouldn't be hounding you the way she has been, but I completely get why she's pissed. For all you know she's been waiting in for you, only for you to cancel. She may have cancelled other plans to be there when you've given dates and times. And then you get all petty and refuse to give it to her bevause your annoyed that she's called you out on your shitty behaviour. If you agree to do something, then you need to follow through on that and not keep rearranging. Or just tell her to collect it to begin with.", "Now that there\u2019s more context you\u2019re still NTA imo.\n\nYou offered free items. She said yes she wants them but asks you to deliver them to her. You said yes you will obviously and your kids get sick so your original plan to deliver on Monday fell through - now she\u2019s texting you everyday asking for a new date and time and getting upset with you. Then you fell asleep by accident and you messaged her apologizing and empathizing with her impatience and disappointment, you ask if she can get someone to come get the items for her since you\u2019re having a hard time clearly and she\u2019s still mad? Yeah, she can still fugg right off in my opinion.", "YTA\n\nYou told her you'd give her these items and would deliver them to her. You give her some dates earn you can deliver them and each time you fail to do so, for different reason every time. The thing is, just because you're giving her this stuff free, it doesn't excuse you leaving her hanging. You should've given her a time snd date snd kept it.", "NTA.", "YTA.  You offered, she didn\u2019t ask.  And then you waste her time by flaking out every time.  You tell her you are coming, she waits and then you come up with an excuse.  Stop playing these games.  She didn\u2019t ask you for anything.", "YTA. Generally understand if you need to reschedule once or twice however it sounds like you're done with some multitude of times over the past week. You're not respecting her time as well. It doesn't matter if it's free, you made the offer her it's not like she came and asked you for it. So you have a responsibility to follow through what you say you're going to. You sound extremely entitled and insufferable. Don't offer someone something and then offer to do something if you most likely never had the intention of falling through in the first place", "Well I think I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that ESH. I\u2019ll arrange for a mutual friend to come collect the items and still bring them to this person and just cut ties. I was wrong for telling her I could deliver the items and not following through despite my circumstances as everyone has pointed out and then she sucks for being impatient and hounding me. I was being petty by withdrawing the items entirely. Thanks for the input all, but I\u2019m deleting the post now :)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We don\u2019t really talk outside of that at all. This friend doesn\u2019t drive or have a license nor has she ever tried to get it.\n\nI was supposed to drop some things off for her that I was giving away for free (it\u2019s something she doesn\u2019t need to have, I\u2019m giving away an old makeup chair and some home decor) and I know she\u2019s making herself a little office in her house and I asked if she wanted these things to spice up the decor. She said yes. I was supposed to drop it off on Monday and then things got busy for me all this week after work which I didn\u2019t anticipate and I haven\u2019t been able to which I\u2019ve been communicating with her about. She has not offered to come get the stuff or get someone who drives to come get it for her. I could tell she was getting upset with me because she would start sending me one word answers if I couldn\u2019t bring her the furniture that day and not being very accommodating or understanding at all. Everyday I would wake up with a slew of texts of her asking when and at what time I would be bringing the stuff. I would tell her I hope to bring it to her at xy time but I\u2019ll have to see what happens after I pick up the kids from daycare.\n\nI was going to drop the stuff off last night but then I fell asleep by accident putting my youngest to bed. I woke up and immediately saw the time on my child\u2019s clock. I looked at my phone and saw a text from her saying she\u2019s tired of this game I\u2019m playing. She started getting mad at me because I haven\u2019t dropped these furniture items off and sent me a slew of really passive aggressive and childish messages saying how she\u2019s so over me bailing on her and that she\u2019s sick of this shit.\n\nI responded back and told her I had other responsibilities after work that take priority over furniture delivery and that she could come get the stuff herself and get her roommate who drives to come get it if she can\u2019t wait for me to have some availablity. I told her I know she\u2019s excited to get these things and I\u2019m excited to give them to her but that sadly things have been coming up. I told her that I apologize for falling asleep tonight, it was not my intent and I\u2019m not dodging her on purpose. She responded back being rude yet again and that she doesn\u2019t appreciate me making her wait. I keep pushing the dates around. I got tired of the back and forth and I told her that I\u2019m not giving her the stuff anymore and she can get bent at this point. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Looks like OP told her to have her roommate collect the stuff for her if she is upset and the TP was still mad. I probably wouldn\u2019t deliver it either or go to great lengths to give her free stuff.", "Absolutely, I should have kept my promise but I have 3 young kids and something came up that day with the kids so I couldn\u2019t do it. Then she was messaging me everyday asking me what time I can bring the stuff and I\u2019d either say not or tell her I can try for a certain time but I can\u2019t make a guarantee on that because of the kids and she would get mad or short with me. Last night I did tell her to have her roommate come get the stuff and she started getting upset with me still so I said screw it all at that point. I\u2019m a single mom and I have 3 sick kiddos right now so this week wasn\u2019t good for me and I tried explaining that to her but she wasn\u2019t having it.", "^ ^ ^ this. all of this ^ ^ ^\n\nGreat reply, very thorough! !\n\nESH", "Yep. Exactly my thoughts.", "Yes, I should have specified in my post about my sick kids because it seems people think I\u2019ve been flaky for no good reason but maybe having sick kids isn\u2019t a good reason?", "I should have kept my Monday promise but I have 3 young kids and I\u2019m a single mom and something came up that day with my kids. Then the rest of the week was a disaster because of that. It wasn\u2019t because I was just making lame little excuses to avoid doing it or never had the intent to do it. I genuinely did. It just wasn\u2019t working out and she kept messaging me everyday asking what time I can come and assuming I could do it on certain days and times and getting upset if I couldn\u2019t coincide on what she wanted.", "I should have probably specified that I rescheduled Monday and told her I would have to see how the rest of my week goes and she kept messaging me everyday for a date and time and if I couldn\u2019t that day I would tell her and if there was a chance I could I would tell her I can\u2019t make a guarantee and she would get angry.", "I should have specified that we decided Monday - I could not do it because something happened with my kids and told her I would have to see how my week goes and everyday she would text me and ask me what time I would come that day and I would either tell her I can\u2019t because this week is still looking busy and if there was a possibility I could at a certain time I would let her know. I have 3 children under 6 years old and I\u2019m a single mom so I don\u2019t much help since my ex husband moved back to his home state. We agreed to do it last night (Wednesday) and I fell asleep by mistake. I told her if she can\u2019t wait to have her roommate drive to get it and she got angry at me again. But you\u2019re right. I should have either told her she had to come get it herself or took some time off work to deliver the items while the kids were still at daycare.", "I offered new updates but I can see why ESH. As we discussed I took missteps and acted petty towards her so I\u2019ll get a mutual friend to deliver the items to her still and just cut ties. Thank you for being kind!", "It\u2019s okay - life happens and I get it. I have kids myself. I\u2019m usually super understanding and empathetic when it comes to sick kids. I know not everyone has kids. None of my friends have kids and they get really upset when I can\u2019t make events or do things how I used before becoming a mom but priorities change as we evolve in our lives. Don\u2019t beat yourself up. I would still give her the items though I\u2019d just drop them off the second I have some time.", "Then don't make her promises you can't keep. Just because you promised to give her this stuff free doesn't mean you don't have to keep your word. Each time you gave her a date, you bailed. It is annoying to wait around on someone who flakes on their word.", "You rescheduled to last night, then didn't show", "You\u2019re right. I should still give her the items but I don\u2019t know she\u2019ll talk to me. My 2 kids have had the worst time this week and it\u2019s just been days of sickness on and off and I\u2019m still going to work full time. My youngest has been receptive to the fact her older sisters aren\u2019t well and it\u2019s just been chaos in my home. But I should still deliver the things or find someone who can since I did offer them to her. So I am still the asshole in the scenario.", "Typically I don\u2019t flake on my word and I\u2019ve upheld every other time I\u2019ve delivered her free items or offered her rides to our friends events. This isn\u2019t my first time I\u2019ve delivered free things to her and this week just wasn\u2019t working out for me. But you\u2019re right I should have kept my word and delivered the items despite what was going on and just gotten it out of the way.", "Yes, I did and by a complete mistake. I did message her immediately as soon as I woke up and apologized to her. It wasn\u2019t my intent to fall asleep but my kids have been sick and I was clearly exhausted from the week we had so far. I told her if she\u2019s tired of waiting to have her roommate come get the stuff and she didn\u2019t want to ask her. She was the one who asked me to deliver the items for her cause she can\u2019t drive. So I told her I would try my best to bring them to her.", "I think you both took missteps during the last interaction. But I still don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. I see a burnt out mom who was trying to do a nice thing and it didn\u2019t work out. Clearly this person doesn\u2019t have kids or understand how that can be. So don\u2019t panic. But you\u2019re kind for still wanting find a way to deliver the stuff to her. You\u2019re a good human and we all can be assholes. Good luck!", "Absolutely. I did take missteps and I shouldn\u2019t have let my frustration get the best of me. I have a mutual friend who hangs out with her pretty often that will deliver the stuff since they get together 3-4 times a week and I\u2019ll just cut ties at that point with her and going forward I\u2019ll just sell my stuff so I can make money instead haha", "Totally :) I think a lot of people in the comments don\u2019t have kids and either didn\u2019t read the post entirely or the updates. But best of luck to you though. Like I said - don\u2019t sweat this. Find people who are more empathetic and emotionally mature to have in your life. We gotta pick and choose our battles."]}
