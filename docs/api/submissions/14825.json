In some countries there is no law requiring you to care for another person who is not your child/in your care.

But I also believe that part of her incompetence is not due to having a lower intelligence but because my mother never taught her resilience or perseverance. Whenever she hit a roadblock in anything, school or whatever, my mother would fight for her to get out of doing whatever it was she was struggling in, so she never learned how to push through the tough teething period everyone faces when learning something new.", "I did suggest this very gently to dad once but he reacted so badly and got super incensed that I, her blood sibling, was not going to take her into my home for life, and he kept going on about how a group home was no place for my sister to be in.", "I have talked to them about this countless times. However, I feel the reason they don't want to set up a trust for her is SOLELY because it would cost them money to do so. My parents are all about pinching pennies. So I doubt they will do it. They refuse to even get a proper will done for themselves.", "Thank you. I actually feel you've summed up everything I've struggled for years to verbalise. Until today, they expect EVERYBODY to give my sister a break. They expect the world to give into her for every single thing.\n\nYou know what the stupidest thing is? Their rationale for why everyone should give into my sister (including me) is because \"she's so innocent, so pure of heart, like a little child who will never grow up.\"\n\nMy sister may not be the smartest, but she's greedy, selfish, entitled, can be manipulative, and likes to take advantage of people in every situation she can. In short, she's a younger version of my dad (who is completely selfish and takes advantage of anyone he can make use of).\n\nI think that's why they keep insisting she's pure and innocent. To admit she was otherwise would be to slap themselves in the face.", "I have tried to go NC and failed. We live in a fairly small country and it's easy to keep track of people around. So I'm just trying to make the most of the situation for now and do my best to just push back. I've given into my parents on too many things, but this is a hill I do think is worth dying on. I don't like my sister and hate it that my parents continually play the \"but she's your family\" card.", "They tend to talk about this in person when they come to my house without any prior notice (we live in a small town). There's no escape. Unless I move, I'm kinda stuck in this situation. And it's not easy to move. But I do agree that they should create a fund and make her get a job. Unfortunately my parents are cheapskates who are really hoping that they won't have to do any of those things because they'll cost them time and money (it'll cost money to set up a fund and get a lawyer, and it'll cost lots of money to get my sister therapy so she can start learning whatever she should've learned decades ago to be able to contribute to society and lead a meaningful existence).", "I agree with you totally. You know the crazy thing is that until now, they insist that they're amazing parents for being so loving and protective of their 35-year-old. From insisting that she had zero special needs, they've flipped 180 degrees and now tend to overdo the special needs card in the hopes that I'll feel guilty that I have a special needs sister and just give into whatever they want.\n\nIt's as if they think I'll completely forget that for the first 30+ years of my life, I was brainwashed to believe my sister was not special needs and in fact super smart with an IQ of 110. I don't get it. Zero accountability.", "She likely does have special needs as she is not the brightest and she can't really process complex information, but I also do feel my mum played a huge role in turning my sister into the person she is today.", "I've tried suggesting help and all, but my mum's answer has always been that SHE knows best when it comes to my sister's needs and is not willing to listen to me. In any case my parents both have always disliked me and till this day (I'm 40) STILL talk about the sins I committed when I was 10, 13, 15, 17, 20 (these are not arbitrary ages but real numbers they bring up a lot). So whatever I say just falls on deaf ears. I shut up now.", "I moved out years ago, but we live in a small town and I can't really escape them. Thankfully my parents also dislike me and will go months without seeing me. Sadly, they've needed to use me recently for their own needs and so have been starting their crap again.", "Your parents have done YS a huge disservice  by raising her to feel entitled to not working and being supported by others. It was a very unhealthy dynamic to expect you to take responsibility for her actions even as a child. That's on them. Luckily, as an adult, you can walk away from all of them. Your parents can figure out some form of trust for her, putting their assets into it so she can be taken care of (if they have any assets). It's not your problem, you didn't create it, they did, and don't let them use the family card to blackmail you into giving up your life for someone who refuses to work when she can.", "Thank you. I needed to hear this. The thing that I hate most is how they completely deny all they did when we were kids. They keep insisting till today that I had the best childhood and I was the crappy brat and not YS who was an angel (lololol). They spent years telling me I was a crappy person and none of my friends really liked me. Today I have wonderful friends who are the family my own family will never be. Grateful for them.", "Remind them of all those times they told you you were a crappy person, and ask them why they'd want their precious angel to be dependent on a crappy person all her life. Then cut all ties with these people and spend your time and energy on the family you've built for yourself. Life is too short to waste on people who don't appreciate you.", "NTA and ESH \n\nYou are absolutely right that your sister should be enabled to work within her ability level no matter how menial it may be. \n\nLife is really hard and being entitled and protected is asking for trouble, it\u2019s creating a very long term problem that is now here. Having said that intellectual disability can change over time, it can get worse or you can gain confidence and independence and improve.\n\nI feel for you because I have first hand experience of similar situation, from various angles and unfortunately yes you might have to assist one day because you are a good person with sound mind you can clearly see things as they are. \n\nNo your sister should not live with you if she has the capacity to live independently of family and if she needs a supported living that may be ideal for her. \n\nAlso if it\u2019s going to drive you mad absolutely no. \n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be right for you to walk away completely when your parents die and are not able to be there somehow and a little reassurance would not be out of place. It\u2019s just very very hard path to be a special needs parent and all of these apprehensions and misguided lack of discipline are bourne out of a difficult but strong love. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, way dumber people have succeeded in life. This is on your parents and sister, all three are trying to take advantage of you. Cut contact with all of them.", "My sister is disabled as well. It took my parents 19 years to realize that codling her is a disservice to HER. Overprotection removes agency. \n\nI took a few years, but she is now doing much better and is much more able to function in the world.

You are 100% NTA.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust move away and go no contact with your Ah parents.", "This, 100%. NTA She can rent the basement out to somebody else is she needs the money.

I have told my parents over and over that not only will I give her my share of any inheritance (which won't be much as they are not healthy) to help her, but that I will ensure I step in to check in on her and help her do well. I also said that if she's struggling financially, I'd be happy to give her some cash to tide her over. This is despite the fact that my sister is honestly super lazy and has stated categorically that she HATES working and doesn't ever want to work. For as long as I can remember, she has asked for cash handouts and other goodies.\n\nThe thing is, they don't want that. They want me to take over whatever they're doing now to make sure my sister doesn't need to change her lifestyle. And I really can't commit to that.", "I don't think LC will be enough, you need to go NC because any answer you give your parents will not be accepted unless it is what they want hear which would be you falling in line and agreeing to baby their little princess until your death.\n\nYou arr NTA, but you will be to yourself if you don't walk away now."]}
