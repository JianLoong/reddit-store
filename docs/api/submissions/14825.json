Unfortunately my parents are cheapskates who are really hoping that they won't have to do any of those things because they'll cost them time and money (it'll cost money to set up a fund and get a lawyer, and it'll cost lots of money to get my sister therapy so she can start learning whatever she should've learned decades ago to be able to contribute to society and lead a meaningful existence).", "I agree with you totally.

Many people are less traditionally intelligent but have a decent job and also find meaning/enjoyment in other things they are good at.", "It does seem like your parents gave you a short stick in life. You\u2019re definitely NTA and should not bear the responsibility for your sister for the rest of your life. \n\nI wish you and your sister luck, she seams to be a victim too in this in many ways.", "Sadly you are right... I honestly believe she might have thrived in adulthood if she has been given the right support. She's been trained to be a mini version of my parents in all ways, entitled, selfish, always trying to take advantage of everyone around her", "A crappy person bullies those who are helpless or different.

Family is chosen", "Only you can fix this and that is by changing the habit of a lifetime and saying NO. You say you can\u2019t avoid them but you can still say NO. Period. No discussion. They can whine and moan all they want. It may be some simple thing and it would seem easier to do it so they\u2019ll shut up and go away but you need to establish the fact that you can and will say NO.\n\nDon\u2019t stop saying it. Practice it in your imagination. Say it over and over. Lock the door when they try to come over. Just say NO!\n\nNO!\n\nETA to add NTA", "Nah, they'll just as quickly deny they ever said such things. There's no point wrestling with a pig, you both get dirty but the pig enjoys it.", "NTA. Your parents failed your younger sister by spoiling and coddling her. Not getting her the special ed help in her formative years. and when they are gone she is gonna suffer. They should get a big life insurance plan if they want her taken care of.", "NTA and time for no contact. Your parents are much like mine so I can confirm that yours are doing everything wrong. Some responsibility falls upon YS herself but your parents, if they care about doing the right thing at all, should get her into therapy, make her understand the world doesn't revolve around her, and encourage her to get a job. Giving her uncontested access to your parents inheritance is already generous. Sounds like your parents broke her, time for 'em to fix her.", "NTA. You owe them nothing.  Even if your sister was profoundly disabled it would still not be your responsibility to take care of her. Your parents clearly only care about \"family\" when it suits them.", "NTA. please consider drastically decreasing contact with this family.", "NTA\n\nRun. Set the boundary now. Get them to figure out you won't be responsible.", "NTA", "NTA.  \n\nYou parents are huge assholes who have abused both their children-- the abuse to YS is maybe less obvious, but they have infantilized her and made her much less able than she could be.\n\nI got to the part about her deserving half your salary and had a visceral HELL NO reaction.\n\nThis is not on you, and will never be on you.  This is on your parents until they die, and then it will all come crashing down on YS.\n\nI think you should get away from these people, cut all contact and leave them behind.  You owe them nothing.", "NTA. You don't have to put up with this. I see you live in a smaller community where you might not be able to disappear, but you absolutely do not have to be spoken to  like that, by anyone. If they can't even be civil, just treat them like toddlers and use calming voices to explain you will not engage with tantrums. You are an adult, shut them down.", "NTA. You're not her parent, so why are you being parentified? Not cool", "NTA\n\nMy siblings have experienced this first hand and it is not only mentally draining but it takes a toll on your every being. Similar to your sibling, the brother we take care of has learned helplessness due to the coddling done by our parents. I even noted how you said if they were disabled or severely special needs you would have no problem taking care of them and that solidified my NTA vote. My brother who acts like your sibling has become a burden and has affected our mental health so no one wants to take care of him. While our other brother who has down syndrome we all fight to take care of him when he gets older (he is a late teen).  I think the words hurtled at you by your parents is cruel and you are none of those. If someone who has the ability to be independent and can do all their ADLs (activities of daily living such as bathing and clothing oneself) but self-sabotages because they have learned to not face any consequences regardless of their wrong doing is going to become a bigger problem to everyone around them later in life. Hold your ground and fight for your own independence. Suggest that someone sit down with your sibling to write down what accommodations they need in order to be successful in the workplace. As someone who has had debilitating ADHD, the accommodations have helped me immensely to be successful.  Best of luck to your sibling, your family, and especially you!", "I really appreciate this. Just a few days ago I had an honest talk with a friend who has a teenage brother with down's and she told me she loves her brother so much that she will always take care of him. And I asked her about my situation and she said she felt it was very different because her brother was truly unable to care for himself whereas, as you mentioned, YS definitely ticks off every single area of ADL on her own, including cooking, shopping for her favourite trinkets (always on someone else's coin), and all. I cannot suggest that someone sit her down to talk to her because I'm the scapegoat of my family and have always been. But I value that suggestion and hope I have the chance to voice it one day. Thank you.\n\nWishing you and your siblings all the best as well.", "Then go NC asap. You're sister's an adult and not your responsibility. You didn't bring her to this world. Forget guilt too. If I were you, I'd move to another city to be rid of them. You'll be much happier. As I see it, neither your parents nor your sister can ever be happy.", "That is an unfortunate waste of their money. I\u2019m sorry they are willing to fail both of their daughters in this way.", "Hopefully, the police can help you if they harass you. Count on that resource.", "Lock the door and don't answer it when they show up uninvited.", "Call the police. It seems they harass you and show up in your property against your wishes.", "You owe them nothing. Even if they were amazing parents, you would still owe them nothing.", "\"There's no point wrestling with a pig, you both get dirty but the pig enjoys it\". Brilliant.", "This is exactly why I try not to waste my breath on my parents. They're always spoiling for a fight, always, and it's exhausting. Afterwards they turn around and say it's all my fault and I started it, and act martyred. And yes, denial is a huge part of everything they do. My whole family is just a giant toxic mess. I have a brother to be honest and he's the only decent one and I genuinely care about him, but he's made the wise decision to stay away from all of us (even though I know I'm the only one he trusts, it's just a byproduct of our upbringing that we never meet, talk, or otherwise maintain contact. Didn't help that he very inadvertently and unwittingly married someone with several remarkably similar traits to BOTH my parents as well, so I do try to love him and his wife from a safe distance to protect myself and my family, and my mental health). Thankful for the forever friends in my life who have been more family to me than the people I'm shackled to by DNA.", "op=nta\n\nHonestly, even if her needs made it so that she needed supervision/care--it's still NOT your responsibility as a sibling.  It is the parents responsibility to make a plan for their child's care.\n\nWhat they have done is actually cruel to her, because they have NOT taught her to deal with the real world.    That is sad, because when they are gone, no one will remain to be this buffer they have created.\n\nDo what you have to--to protect yourself from their verbal/emotional attacks.  I will repeat you are NOT responsible for your YS!  Please repeat it to yourself as many times as you need to belief it, to counteract their childhood programming.\n\n<<family is everything, and I owe it all to family.>>  yeah no, when they were punishing YOU for her actions--what do you owe them for that??? \n\nPlus anything done for you as a child--is their debt for bringing you into the world--I don't know what they did for you after you became a legal adult(ie paid for your higher education, etc) but Unless you demanded it, forced them to give it.  Or agreed to pay it back, then nope--no debt there either.", "NTA. It sounds that she is using her special needs as a crutch not to work and she convinced her parents as well.

And given how toxic your parents are, I do not understand why you do not go no contact with them. You need to stop letting them try and dictate your life. It is time to cut them out of your life. They are not good for your mental health or well-being. \n\nThis may sound harsh, but your sister is not your problem. If they want her taken care of, they need to set up a trust fund or find her a group home. Trying to bully or guilt you into spending the rest of your life taking care of her is not an option.", "NTA", "NTA. She isn\u2019t your kid or your responsibility.

VLC is still feasible if we manage to move out of the country).", "NC girl", "Remind your parents that you are evil, a brat, sinful....ect.

Do you think you can help them understand what's happening here?\n\nIt's clear you are overwhelmed by your parents' aggressiveness and manipulation but at some point you must meet their force with one equal to theirs. You are letting them walk over you by merely having a conversation about this. By permitting them to enter your home. By giving them access to your kids.
