My SO is a 4th and he has problems all the time with government/state forms. I also got us insurance and they put his father I stead of him on the insurance.  It's a pain in the ass. I told my SO if we did ever have a kid, the only way I would name them the 5th is of it was a girl.", "The brother did, you\u2019re correct. The brother is a half-sibling and *previously* had a unique surname before getting married. The SIL by coincidence has the same surname as OP, so he did change his surname.

One first name ok but the whole first, middle and last name - very weird imo especially since you aren't ok with it?! \n\nI believe the redditors said there are 3 major credit agencies where you can call and freeze your credit.\n\nAlso consider changing maybe your middle name when you are 18 to avoid beaurocratic  issues.or add an initial -something. Sorry for this I hope I'm completely wrong about it", "Oh and if /when you do don't tell anyone including your mother.

They did this whilst knowing the deeply personal story behind my name.\n\nI was named after a close friend of my parents, who tragically passed away not long before I was born. I was named in honour of her.\n\nWhen my parents asked her if they could name me in honour of her, she was ecstatic. She was so excited and overjoyed. She couldn\u2019t wait to meet me and referred to me as \u201cbaby [our name]\u201d. \n\nShe bought tons of baby clothes for me and even embroidered our name onto one of the onesies she\u2019d bought. \n\nShe was supposed to be my godmother. She never got the chance to meet me.\n\nSo yes, it was unbelievably insensitive and hurtful when a relative, whom I barely have anything to do with, gave my name to their child.

It also didn\u2019t help that my relative\u2019s child was born very close to the anniversary of my namesake\u2019s death.", "So what exactly is so upsetting about it? It\u2019s not like this baby will be in school with you,or hang out in the same friend group, or frankly, even interact with you on any type of level for years. Even if you end up babysitting said child, how does having the same name have any bearing on anything?", "That\u2019s ridiculous. You can draw the line anywhere you want.

We have social security numbers for that reason. Plus people with same names can have different nicknames.\n\nThe one about the ex is different. That is disrespectful, because it's the ex's child, key word is ex. It's like when Adam Levine wanted to name his child after his mistress's name. That's disrespectful. Naming your child after your sibling isn't, unless you were an abusive sibling and have ulterior motives to name the child after a sibling you don't like, but it's not the case here.\n\nIt's just a name, a name that your PARENTS chose, not YOU, it's not that deep.", "For many people it's very normal.", "Omg.
