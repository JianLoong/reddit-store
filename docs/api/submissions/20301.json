You're not very bright, are you?", "YTA Instead of causing emotional distress and the problem is as bad as you are saying it is. You could have secretly replaced the smelly clothes with the exact same shirt and shorts and hopefully avoided your kid from being upset. You are showing your son that you do not care about his feelings, opinion, and things. Your son is confused and you are not providing a proper explanation for your actions.", "YTA. This is brand new to him. His body is different all of a sudden, and he\u2019s 10. This is a parenting situation, not a punishment one. Guide your son better and don\u2019t be mean to him and make him even more ashamed of the indignities of puberty.", "YTA - It sounds like your son is going through puberty and you're punishing him for it.  If he's only wearing the same clothes over and over, you ask him why.  What about those clothes make him feel comfortable and happy.  Take him to the store and find more clothes that are the same/similar.  It doesn't hurt anyone if his entire summer wardrobe is superman shirts and camo shorts.  Give him more clothes he wants to wear and you've solved half your problem.\n\nGive him a dirty clothes hamper and insist his clothes go in it every day.  Make sure he's putting on pjs at night and not sleeping in his clothes so he can re-wear them.  Get him some deodorant and remind him to put it on every day.  Give him time to shower every morning so he's starting the day with clean body and clean clothes.  You might have to be on his case for a month to get the routine established...because he's still a kid even if his body is changing!\n\nThere were better was to handle this, and you took the low road.", "Yeah man, YTA. You could of at least had a conversation with him saying that he needs to improve his hygiene before he gets the shirt and shorts back, and then hiding them somewhere. Maybe stick them in the same drawer as a scented candle or something. Throwing them away doesn\u2019t make you the devil or anything, but it\u2019s a really strange move on your part. \n\nYou just threw away a little bit of your kid\u2019s trust in you, not just the clothing.", "YTA. There's nothing wrong with having a favorite outfit, and you can wash clothes to get the stench out. He will remember\u00a0this unkindness. Try being a first generation gentle parent", "YTA - I\u2019ve never heard of clothes still smelling bad after washing them unless your washer has mold in it. I am also assuming you use detergent, but if not, start there.", "YTA \n\nMaybe not for throwing out clothes that still smell despite washing them repeatedly (though I doubt that, somehow), but for the uncaring and flippant way you\u2019ve approached this with your son. I don\u2019t know how a parent who is present and involved in a child\u2019s life could be surprised by the fact that their child a) has a attachment to a specific set of clothing that he wear every day and b) that throwing out said clothing without talking to their kid about it would make him upset", "YTA for saying you won\u2019t buy new clothes til he smells better. i understand that the stench in old clothes won\u2019t come out, but your son maybe does not. my advice is to explain calmly, be his resource for learning. he\u2019s 10, hygiene is hard, and he\u2019s probably embarrassed at school or will be soon, naturally. this needs to be a lesson on maintaining cleanliness, which can only be done in a compassionate way. does he have a shower routine? if not, make one, such as, always on school nights. be the example for him. why doesnt he like the other clothes? find multiple NEW outfits he\u2019d like to wear, take him shopping with you maybe, and explain how if we like something, we have to keep it clean so we have it in the future. does he wear deodorant? does he understand the why- that his body is changing. this is deeper than just clothes if you\u2019d like to truly teach, support, and help your child. \nI\u2019d like to add that the fact you\u2019re aware, and trying to help your child is worth noting. many parents (like my own) let children go to school hair a mess, clothes stinking, etc. your heart is there, and every child is different with these things, but it sounds like he may need some help in really understanding the why. i wish you both the best in learning together!", "YTA that's cruel & not helping. either there's something wrong with your washing machine or with your sense of smell because there's no way the clothes should be smelling after 2 washes. Also getting rid of his clothes and refusing to buy more is going to make him change his clothes less so your whole thought process on this is stupid. He's 10, you're the parent, if he's not good at remembering to change his clothes frequently yet then it's your job to remind him and to make sure his clothes are getting washed regularly", "YTA. Why get rid of something he loves? You could have said \"ok buddy these clothes are only for playing outside now, not for school/being in public.\"\n\nI had a dress at age 5 that I loved so much, it was loose and comfy and I loved the floral pattern. My mom threw it away because she said it was too big. Which didn't make any sense to me (and still doesn't) because I would have grown into it. And we were poor then too, why get rid of something perfectly good? I still think about that dress, and I'm 34 now. I have bought dresses as an adult purely because they have a similar pattern. \n\nSo even if something seems like a silly attachment and a \"kid\" thing, those are still meaningful to children, it's their whole world. Being a kid is confusing and frustrating enough, and it's when adults do capricious, arbitrary, and sudden violations like throwing out your stuff without asking or talking through it first, that really makes childhood suck.", "I am not sure why you posted here, as you clearly are not listening at all.

Since washing it with just detergent isn\u2019t working have you tried washing his clothes other ways or considered that maybe your washer needs to be cleaned?  Baking soda neutralizes odors so soaking his clothes with that and water may work or if you\u2019ve been adding too much detergent that would\u2019ve made the problem worse", "If you can afford it, you could buy a few sets of whatever is his favorite.", "YTA  \nLearn to parent  \nTake him out and buy him several new outfits so he is strating with nice clean clothes.   \nLet him choose some bodywash and shampoo  \nThen tell him he has to shower every night as part of his bedtime routine. This is something many households do anyhow. If he is resistant , move it a bit earlier so he showers, gets in clean pJs and then watches TV or whatever.   \nChange the sheets on his bed at least once a week.  \nForcing a kid to wear clothes they don't like until start to shower makes no sense.   \nLearn to do laundry", "YTA. He's getting into his teens and his body is changing without him even realizing. Instead of throwing his favorite clothes away you should explain how his hormones work and how he needs to wash in order to preserve his health and his \"social relationships\". \nProve him his clothes stink and tell him he needs to wash more/better if he doesn't want his favorite clothes to stink.", "It looks like you came here just to get your opinion validated, not to genuinely ask aita. You have made excuses for every YTA judgement instead of just accepting the truth and learning from it.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Everyone else has told you why & I agree with them. I'm only here to help with the laundry issue. Good news! It won't break your neck. *rolls eyes* Purchase some borax & washing soda. They are in the laundry soap section. Add a half cup of borax & 1/3 cup of washing soda directly in with the clothing. You're welcome.", "YTA \n\n> his mom told me to buy new stuff but I said no \n\nSo... What are you trying to do here? Buying him new clothes and taking the time to establish a routine would probably a more helpful approach if you want him to learn", "YTA. He is 10 years old, a literal child. Throwing away his favorite clothes and telling him he doesn\u2019t get new ones as punishment seems like an unnecessarily unkind approach. This is an opportunity to support him taking care of himself and taking pride in his appearance. Take him to get new favorite clothes, show him how to make his new wardrobe last with proper care of both himself and his things. Self-care is self-love, you can\u2019t teach love through punishment and shame.", "YTA. The solution here was to just buy him more of his favorite clothes.

Trying to build good habits surrounding personal hygiene is important, yes.\n\nPunishing a kid for going through puberty and having body odor, and throwing away things he cares about, is not building good habits. That\u2019s being a bad parent.", "YTA - There's better ways of approaching this sort of thing, if your kid constantly wore that outfit then talking to him and figuring out what makes him comfortable would have been a good step. Throwing out something he has an attachment to, one that should have been clear by the fact he wore it so often, can be upsetting at a young age.  \nFind clothing that fits what he likes, have a proper talk and make sure he knows just what exactly he should do to properly clean himself as well. Kids don't know immediately how to properly clean up, they need to be taught that's part of your job as a parent.", "You may need to add a sports clothes additive for his clothing \nOr there are odor remover additives that take the smell out at the molecular level.

In fact, he may even see the reason in your actions once he's a full fledged adult. I will say that he needs to be taught proper hygiene and why it's important. If you're unsure how to do that, consult literature on guiding children through puberty. Give your son and yourself grace navigating this new stage in his development.", "Gonna say NTA. Too many people here pamper kids to extremes. When I was a kid stuff of mine that I liked got thrown out when it was heavily damaged/ruined/stinking/broken. My parents would tell me why, and often take me to go have it replaced. I don't have any lingering trust or anger issues from it. In fact I learned a valuable lesson from it: material possessions probably won't last forever, so don't be so emotionally attached to them.\n\nOh and my parents also made sure I was always washing regularly and changing clothes. In fact my brothers did as well, wanting me to be presentable. Looking back I respect them for it. First impressions matter.", "NTA. I really don't understand how a Mom can be TA for educating her son. I am an Asian and my mom would have literally spanked me if I behaved like this. 10 years is still a young impressionable age. Too much pampering turns into behavioural issues later, since the world teaches you lessons that your parents failed to teach you. What's wrong with the western countries?", "NTA. My son is 10 and going through the same thing. He likes to sleep in the clothes he wore during the day and I have to tell him to take his clothes off and get in the shower. My husband asked me what\u2019s issue that he did that all the time as a kid. I tell him it\u2019s gross and unhygienic plus he has allergies and all that pollen on his clothes makes it worse.", "NTA he needs to learn the lesson one way or another and will ultimately not care about this choosing to not replace his clothes is wrong but apart from that NTA", "NTA. If the clothes were still smelling even after being washed so much, it was beyond saving. Kids need to understand that they cannot just do everything they want, this includes wearing stink clothes just because they like them", "NTA.  I have had a kid like that.  On a road trip, we had to stop and buy new shoes and throw out the old ones before we asphyxiated.  I have also had the problem of clothes that still stink after being washed with regular detergent.  You might try Biofilm Buster.  It works to get rid of that as they call it permastink.", "Esh having clothing you feel truly comfortable in is just \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd nothing compares to it. however no one likes stinky clothes or being made fun of for being the stinky kid. Its better that you removed them rather than having your child bullied for it. Some clothes you just can't get the stench out of.", "NTA but Pour cold water into a bucket (or the sink) and add vinegar. Think about 2 dl of vinegar for 10 liters of water. Leave the smelly garment in the vinegar bath for about 20 minutes (note that the garment should not last longer than 30 minutes, as colors and textiles may be damaged).
