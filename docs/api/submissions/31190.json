It's a nice gesture and a great option for people.  If they object to the $6 an hour, they can leave their kids at home and hire their own sitter for $15+ an hour.  No one is forcing them to take advantage of the offer.", "NTA, as a single parent with minimal options - I\u2019d adore that idea. I think it\u2019s thoughtful. Anyone appreciative would certainly pay. That\u2019s not even that bad.", "I understand where people are coming from on this, but in the year of our lord 2023, we are all of us just tryna get by. $6/kid/hour feels as reasonable to me as doing a potluck or contributing to a shared restaurant bill. If someome doesn't have kids/leave them at home they don't have to contribute, Right? NAH. Just different ideas of how hosting works.", "I think it\u2019s a great idea for everyone to enjoy the party while having someone else babysit the kids. We\u2019ve done that and I think it\u2019s such a relief knowing that they\u2019re being watched and entertained. NTA", "Definitely NTA. You were considerate enough to secure childcare for anyone that chooses to bring their kid - something you absolutely didn't have to do. I'd be so appreciative if someone did this for me, it would take something off my plate for the night.", "NTA - Maybe the way you phrased it was the issue.  \n\nSomething better may have been \"We've hired our awesome sitter to come over and watch our kids during the party.  She is open to caring for additional children during the party as well, for a cost of $6 per hour per kid.  If anyone would like to bring their kids along, please let us know asap so that this can be arranged with the sitter.\"\n\nIt sounds like you're hiring a sitter and having everyone reimburse you.  $6 an hour per kid is a bargain for a sitter, but I can see how it would seem tacky to some people.  Letting people know that the sitter is willing to take on some additional clients for the party actually sounds quite nice.", "Not tacky at all. You have offered a wonderful solution to childcare for a party. Your friends are just cheap. NTA.", "NTA. Six bucks an hour is a smoking deal and it\u2019s not your job to provide childcare. If people want to stay home or spend a lot more to hire their own sitter at home they\u2019re welcome to do that.", "NTA. Your friends have options: not come to the party, find alternative child care, pay the $6 (which is insanely cheap), whatever. I think your solution is genius, frankly.", "INFO what is the status quo with the kids? In past years were they just also participants of the parties? \n\nIf that is the case then, yeah it is tacky. If all past parties have been adults only, that'd different. I can see how it comes across like either don't bring your kids, pay for our service, or don't come. Inviting someone to your house expecting to have to pay money as tacky as asking somone on a date, picking out the restaurant, then expecting them to pay. Unless it's a frat party, then it's only okay to make the guys pay.\n\nEdit: NAH status quo is no kids at the party. I can see how others might view this as tacky akin to you just don't ask guests to do things or pay for things. IMO is just opinion or culture at that point. No harm, no assholes.", ">we started to get comments saying it was cheap and tacky to have guests pay at our party.\n\nIt could be perceived as cheap and tacky.  There's a difference.  NAH, just people with different ideas about manners and norms.  It takes all kinds to make a world.", "I'd have just said \"the baby sitter would really appreciate tips for her time\" I'd bet she get more", "NTA of course they have to pay for their own childcare. Those people are seriously entitled.", "NTA\n\nAsking your guests to pay, in general, is kinda tacky, but that's not what you're doing. You're offering a group rate on childcare if they want it. I'm sure they're more than welcome to set up their own childcare at home.\n\nHonestly I'd be happy to get a discount rate on a babysitter as a perk for a party! Your guests should appreciate how you've set it up.", "NTA if they don\u2019t want to pay for your child care they can find their own and leave their kids else where.", "NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s A LOT cheaper than paying for your own babysitter and means the adults can all relax while the kids are taken care of. I think it\u2019s a brilliant idea. If they don\u2019t want to pay they can leave their kids at home and sort out their own childcare.", "The only issue I see with bringing kids to a party is drunk parents driving them home. \n\nThe on-site babysitter is a good idea.", "If it is expected for every guest to pay for childcare, then YTA.\n\nIf a guest decides to bring their kid and pay for it, then NTA.", "YTA you generally don't ask people to pay at a party , you just eat the cost as the host. Especially something like childcare. Less asshole and more just tacky", "NTA as long as it's optional.\n\nHowever, what kind of adults have a kid-free Christmas party? I would normally expect kids to be part of the party, and maybe even get a lot of the focus.", "YTA. As a parent I would tell you to shove your party", "YTA.

They can stop complaining and pay way less than the going rate or arrange their own child care at a higher rate. Seems like a great deal to me. \n\nCould they be viewing this as a family party as opposed to an adult party with child minding on the side? That would be the only reason to think there would be no cost for the kids.", "It\u2019s definitely cheaper than most babysitters in the area. The only babysitter I got for less than $18 an hour was a kid that had just turned 15 and really had no idea what she was doing", "Nope, if you don\u2019t drop off a kid you don\u2019t pay.", "Plus, I think we have one of the most overqualified babysitters in the area.

That's generally what party host does. pay the cost of the party.  maybe they tell guests to bring something to fill out the menu or whatever, but generally it's seen as the host eats the cost", "I wouldn't allow someone else's nanny to watch my child. \n\nLazy and reckless. \n\nI don't get what your point is.
