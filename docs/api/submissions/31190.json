Don\u2019t bring the kids! If the guests want to bring the kids so they can play with other kids, view the 6 bucks an hour as a \u201centrance fee\u201d for your kids.", "Find alternative child care, pay the $6 (which is insanely cheap), whatever. I think your solution is genius, frankly.", "I was also thinking that it came down to how the offer was phrased. If it was put out there as \"There's a $6 charge per hour for your kids,\" then I could see where it would not be well received. Plus, a lot of people just look for reasons to be outraged, I guess. \n\nBut overall, I think it's a great idea to have a childcare option.", "She said parties have always been adults only", "Offering the group rate - that's the best way to phrase it!\n\nIt immediately calls to mind going to weddings and staying at the specific hotel with the group rate. You don't have to stay there, but it's  generally a better deal and convenient.

It's a brilliant idea! For those that don't want to pay can leave their kids at home or find other accommodations themselves.

I'll bet they change their tune.", "Wow. Just wow.  I\u2019m thinking back to my days of babysitting for multiple AH kids at a time for $2 an hour. Circa 1990.\n\nETA - I know, I know, inflation, but minimum wage was $4.35 an hour then. So I was getting half minimum wage and it was the standard rate in our neighborhood.

I don\u2019t like adults much and the only events I attend are family events where there are more children than adults. I also rarely drink and have never been drunk. \nAlso I\u2019m a parent who actually likes being with my children have never left them with a babysitter. \nWhy would I want to be friends with people who want to dump their children with a babysitter so they can get drunk?", "They would have to pay for their own babysitter at home though if they wanted to come to the party? Like, I don't understand the difference. And this option is way cheaper than them paying a sitter at home. It's $6 an hour vs $20-$25. OP isn't forcing them to use their babysitter they have lined up, its an option for the guests.", "NTA - Maybe the way you phrased it was the issue.\n\nSomething better may have been \"We've hired our awesome sitter to come over and watch our kids during the party. She is open to caring for additional children during the party as well, for a cost of $6 per hour per kid. If anyone would like to bring their kids along, please let us know asap so that this can be arranged with the sitter.\"", "INFO: Did the initial invite say kids are welcome and then you added the childcare later, or has this been the plan from the beginning?", "Yeah, early 90s I babysat for this one family and I was paid $20 for the whole night. Looking back I really should've charged more, but it was a regular gig and my brother's girlfriend also babysat them and that was what she charged.\n\nI'm lucky in that we've never had to pay a babysitter for us to go out for an evening, other than daycare we've been lucky enough to have family to watch our son. I would probably pay for him to play at a party while we were elsewhere having fun. NTA.", "If it doesn't work for uou, then just don't do it and get your own sitter at home.

Arranged activities at the party so that I can see that they are ok but still be able to relax? Win-win-win!", "I think you misunderstand - it\u2019s a party for adults. Kids are not invited or catered to. What OP is doing is providing onsite babysitting for those who would otherwise have to make their own arrangements for childcare on this night.", "They don\u2019t want it for their party. They wanted to make it easier for their adult guests to attend.

Drinking isn\u2019t the only reason adults seek tome to spend with only other adults.\n\n2. It\u2019s perfectly valid for you to take this stance on never hiring child care for your own kids.

Sounds like it was for the party to me when you put both that way.\nYou seem oblivious. It is literally for their party.

Kids are not invited to the PARTY.", "No. It's asking them to pay to have someone watch their kid if they don't have or couldn't find an alternative.\n\nThey are free to not bring their kid to an adults only party. OP is just trying to make it easier. \n$6 an hour is a lot more manageable for some parents than $30+ an hour or whatever they would pay for other sitters.

Still cheaper.)", "No, it wasn\u2019t offered as an alternative to attending the party with one\u2019s kids. it\u2019s an adults only party.

If you were my friend and acted like that, you would no longer BE my friend.", "Or you know they get the older kids or the spouse or family or friends to watch for free or whatever. But my point is this babysitter was brought in for the party and the party guests, to claim it wasn't for the party is ridiculous. That's like saying I invited you to come over and hang out, not eat food, but I'm going to put food on the table because I know you might be hungry, and you can pay me for the food since we will ll be hanging out for several hours, but the food wasn't the purpose of the invitation .

The babysitter charges $5 per extra kid per hour. OP is charging their guests $6 per kid per hour. OP is in fact using this to subsidize their own babysitter", "OP explained that the difference would be used for a tip. OP is already paying the sitter $45/hour so a tip would not be necessary on top of that.
