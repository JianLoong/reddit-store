Your guests should be thanking you!", "NTA. \n\nThe response should be \u201cSure, I understand you\u2019d prefer to arrange childcare at your own home\u201d.", "NTA. Yes you are hosting, however its not your responsibility to provide childcare. If people are unhappy paying towards the 'communal' sitter then they are free to make arrangements of their own. Simple really. Each parent is responsible for the care of their own children. Pretty sure when they cant find a sitter or its expensive they will realise this is the best option.", "I think it\u2019s a really good idea but how does it work for parents who bring their kids and they end up running around and causing a bother. It seems like people feel as though they\u2019re being coerced into paying the fee.\n\nNTA, but I think it needed some more thought.", "Your guests are not paying for the party. They are paying for childcare. I would love to see them get a better deal. But tell them they are welcome to make their own arrangements. \n\nNTA", "Ask those who are critical about you mot paying for it all on top of throwing a party, how often they have hosted the same size group of adults and children and fully paid for such deluxe child care.", "NTA. \n\nYou are offering them a service. They can decline. They are free to pay a LOT more than $6/hr and get their own sitter at their house.", "This is an awesome idea!  As a single parent I would happily pay up!", "That\u2019s a fair price, if they want to make use of it they can or they can pay 20-30 dollars themselves for the night. NTA", "OMG. Can I go to this party? How thoughtful and fun for both parents and kids. And at $6/hour. Just tell the other parents it\u2019s a kids free event, though they can use the babysitter at $6/hr per kid if they want.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI'm not a parent, so I'll stay that much out of the gate. IMHO, it's not cheap or tacky. It's thoughtful to me to arrange for the sitter to take more kids on if your sitter is game to take it on. \n\nThey can arrange for their childcare if chipping in doesn't suit them.", "NTA uninvite and cut contact with whoever has a problem with this very reasonable agreement", "NTA. As a former adult babysitter for holiday events I set a base pay & per child fee. The parents absolutely loved it for 2 reasons. One being the hourly rate was much cheaper, but the main reason it was such a hit is that they were close to their children in case one of them got sick or hurt (always in the back of a parent\u2019s mind). Not one of your guests could get a babysitter for $6 an hour, & they definitely wouldn\u2019t get the peace of mind from knowing their child(ren) were less than a minute away.", "Are there still open invitations for this party? I will pay the fee for both my kids lol", "NTA this is really helpful and thoughtful. I'd love to be your guest.", "Can I be your friend? I\u2019d gladly do this to enjoy a fun Christmas party and know my kiddo is having an equally fun time! NTA", "This is so nice of you to do and very cheap, idk what those people\u2019s problem is.", "YTA... \n\nFirst, those rates are outrageous....  plus, you are marking up the service for each kid per hour.\n\nDefinitely ASSHOLES... Wow", "They agreed to childless, not babysitting costs. Their in-laws, best friends, etc.. would probably charge less.", "If you were having them subsidize the whole cost, you\u2019d mildly be TA - asking for the difference per kid at that low cost is AMAZING. NTA.", "Can I come to your party? You've done the work of finding a childcare provider. The cost is very reasonable.  NTA", "NTA - but the delivery of what / how this was presented could have rubbed some people the wrong way. At $6 an hour per kid, I think that\u2019s fair and very reasonable", "Are they required to use the sitter, or are kids welcome at the party itself too?", "NTA.\n\n\"Whilst there is a cost saving to be made in allowing our trusted [childcare person (nanny w/e)] to care for the children for the night, you are more than welcome to make your own arrangements. We look forward to seeing you!\"", "NTA. When my kids were babysitting age and you offered that deal you would of been my new best friend", "NTA - I could have posted this! Thanks for asking.", "Soft YTA. Your thought process was nice. I have kids too, and I get that this is a cheaper option for people than hiring babysitters themselves. But I still think it\u2019s tacky to essentially charge people to attend a party you\u2019re throwing (even if you\u2019re not the one getting the money). It\u2019s a little like having a cash bar.", "NTA, tell the ones complaining you respect their opinion but they can leave their kids with the babysitter of their choosing.", "NTA. You are giving your guests options. Option One is to leave their kid at home with a family member or babysitter. Option Two is sharing some of the cost of the on-site babysitters.   \n\n\nI'm not a parent myself but I see how this is a win-win for everyone. Oh, and those babysitters are CHEAP.", "NTA thats an amazing idea!", "NTA, your guests should be thankful you were providing childcare for them at your party so they wouldn't have to scramble for a babysitter later. 5 dollars per kid per hour is not much. Because you'll be paying the majority since she's your babysitter.  I wish people would say thank you instead of being a Grouch.", "As a parent, I LOVE this idea. OP, anyone who calls it cheap, say, \"I understand you feel asking you to pay for your own childcare is inappropriate, so we'll let our sitter know she won't be watching your child during the party. You can make your own arrangements. Sorry to have even presented the idea to you.\" If they backtrack when they realize they'll be paying $20+ an hour, don't let them. \"We already marked you as a no with our sitter and would not want to do anything to hurt our friendship now that we know how you feel about it.\"", "I agree if say it was initially put as an adult only party and put as say an option for those that may not have any other option such as family. This was not even just an offer it was just an after the fact decision. It is like saying to guests you are invited to our house for this meal and list what you are making then just before the event say \"I spnent this much so everyone bring this much to help with costs\" if you are being a host you either provide if you are making the decision or say something like \"this is just for us adults but if you don't have a sitter or just want your kids to hang with our kids we have this arranged and yours could be part for $$ an hour. Let us know\"", "Ya I\u2019d pay that. It\u2019s so convenient, and $6/hr is more than reasonable.", "Also, the kids can have an age appropriate Christmas party and the adults can be child free. All while knowing their children are only a stones throw away. 2 adults will be supervising, and entertained. The babysitter is already providing crafts and games for them so it has been well thought out on both OP and babysitters parts. That in itself deserves the babysitter and her assistant a decent tip.", "Yeah I think op should clarify that they are covering the sitter price, but each additional kid will cost extra. Honestly I think it would also be fine to have everyone bringing kids split the full cost, but I understand how some might feel slighted by that. But in this case each person is literally only paying for the additional burden created by their child.", "RIGHT?! I absolutely love this idea", "They do get to choose", "It\u2019s a child free party. If someone wants to leave their kids at home with a grandparent or get a sitter for 20+ an hour, that\u2019s fine. This is just a more affordable option for a lot of parents with a highly skilled/qualified sitter", "30 is her base rate. We already had 8 sign up with her", "The kids will not be allowed at the party. They\u2019ll be in a different building.", "And if they can find someone that will charge less or want to go with a babysitter that they\u2019re more familiar with, they can do that. This is just an option.", "This is an adults only party but if they want to leave the kids with someone else, they are welcome to do so.", "This is an amazing idea and I would love it. $6/hr is a freaking STEAL.", "OP, if ever want to host a party with some more GRATEFUL people (who have kids lol), my family would be delighted to attend!!  Babysitters in my area START at $25/hour - and that\u2019s no experience with one kid.  And honestly, if anyone I knew was offering childcare (and it was even slightly subsidized) I would be so grateful and amazed at how wonderful and kind they were.  It definitely goes above and beyond what I\u2019d expected.  I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re friends don\u2019t appreciate the great person/friend you are and the wonderful gift you\u2019re offering.

NTA", "Lol tell them then to not bring their kids and they will have to hire their own babysitter for more money. Lets see how they like that", "I mean, OP could say it as rudely as possible and I\u2019d still be doing summersaults and thanking her for procuring a sitter for THAT cheap. I have two kids and $12/hr for a sitter for BOTH is unheard of. We pay $30-35/hr for a regular sitter on our own.", "Do they perhaps not realize that the babysitter is charging per kid? That\u2019s the only reason I could think of to couch this as \u201ctacky\u201d - if they thought you were charging a per kid fee but paying a flat fee.", "Definitely is where I live unfortunately", "No, I mean the kids who *aren\u2019t* being supervised by the babysitter. \n\nWhat happens when a parent brings their child and says they won\u2019t pay? They have to join the main party.", "I must have missed the option part.

I was there 8 hours because they picked me up 30 minutes early. They only paid me $7.50. Not even a dollar an hour! It was supposed to be one an hour, I guess.  It they never specified that.", "I started at 50 cents an hour in the 70's, no matter how many kids (though usually 1 or 2). Minimum wage was $2.25 I believe. So less than 25%!", "I do get your point, but it's almost like a potluck.  In some groups, byob and/or potluck are still incredibly common ways to host.  \n\nOP's still going through the trouble of hosting, subsidizing the main childcare cost, and presumably providing food and drink.  For close friends, chipping in for babysitting shouldn't negate all the rest of the work she's doing.  Yea it's a fuzzy line because bringing up money can be a *bit* tacky, but a group chipping in for a bigger expense isn't that unusual.", "Depends if OP invited them, then dropped the charge on people later. 3 kids x 3 hours is $54. That's not a casual expense for a lot of people right now with prices being what they are.\n\nIf OP was upfront from the get go people just need to politely decline.", "That\u2019s crazy to me. I heard in America people can have multiple DUIs and still be allowed to drive!", "I'm with you m8. My wife and I have 4 kids.

Edit: I love my kids with everything that I am.  Definitely doesn\u2019t mean that watching kids isn\u2019t a LOT of work and if you\u2019re watching more than one family\u2019s kids than you\u2019ve got multiple parents with different expectations.  Makes me shudder just thinking about it.", "As long as it\u2019s optional. Some of these people may have their own childcare option that won\u2019t cost them at all-like a  grandparent. I\u2019m also one of those that doesn\u2019t want to be told you spent my money before you asked. I\u2019d be irked that you didnt inquire before you set it up, but it is a good idea. I mean look, how hard would have it been in the planning stage if you asked how many would be interested in this? You also run the risk of not making it worth it to have the sitter if only 5 kids show for her and an assistant.", "It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to offer family payment for their time.", "True story: I charged a dollar an hour, $2 if the kids and/or you were awful.", "I doubt the 15 yo getting $18 per hour in the post I was replying to had either, though. Not that good babysitting isn\u2019t worth a fair wage, that\u2019s not my point.", "Yes, in practice, potlucks are how some people throw parties. However, strictly speaking from an etiquette perspective, expecting guests to bring anything is rude and hosting inevitably involves subsidizing. (The same rules even apply to an invitation to dinner at a restaurant, which is of course not how most people dine out with friends.) But the far greater etiquette violation was from those who complained to the host -- if you don't like the invitation, you should just decline.", "In that case, you just wouldn\u2019t bring your kid to the party and you wouldn\u2019t have to pay the $6 an hour. No one is being forced to bring their kid.", "SMFH. Your comment makes zero sense. No one is \"spending your money before you asked.\" If people have another childcare option and their kids don't come to the party, they obviously won't have to pay for the babysitter.
