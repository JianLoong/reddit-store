{"id": 2519, "submission_id": "yxe0pd", "title": "AITA for leaving my wife at the store after waiting 1.5 hours for her?", "selftext": "TA obviously.\n\nSo today was my day off during the week which I like to use for cleaning the house, running errands, and relaxing in the evening. So my wife and I were running errands with our two kids (2YO and 3 months) and everything was going fine. We got groceries, washed the car, and made a stop at a store about 20-30 minutes away from home. It\u2019s getting close to the time we have dinner so we start heading home. As we\u2019re going home my wife says we need to stop by a department store so she can pick up something she ordered that they shipped to the store. That\u2019s fine the store is on the way home about 15 minutes from our house. My wife assures me it\u2019ll only be like 10 minutes. That\u2019s cool. \n\nAs we\u2019re driving to the store the older child falls asleep because they didn\u2019t get their nap, so I tell her to run in and I\u2019ll stay in the car with the kids. She goes in, 10 minutes goes by, 20 minutes goes by. No prob. Maybe there\u2019s a line. 30 minutes, 40 minutes, she\u2019s still gone. I call her to see if she\u2019s okay, no answer. I call her again at 50 minutes and she says she hasn\u2019t picked the thing up because she saw something she wanted to try on so she\u2019s been doing that. I ask her to finish up so we can go home because our kid is tired and needs dinner and bed. I wait. Still nothing. \n\nAfter an hour I call again and she says she\u2019s gonna be a while, her mom showed up and they\u2019re trying stuff on. I tell her to please hurry, the car has been running, gas is expensive, and our kids are starting to wake up. Again she says she\u2019s almost done. During this time both of our kids wake up and start screaming/crying. I get the older one calmed down, but the younger is hungry and my boobs don\u2019t work that way so I can\u2019t feed him.\n\nIt\u2019s been 1.5 hours. I call her and tell her I\u2019m leaving with the kids because they\u2019re starving and tired. She can get a ride home with her mom who lives near us. She huffs and says she\u2019s coming so I wait another 10 minutes and she\u2019s still not there so I leave. \n\nAs I\u2019m driving I get angry calls from her and MIL about how could I abandon my wife at the store like that? My MIL says I was an AH and way out of line. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1668652361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxe0pd/aita_for_leaving_my_wife_at_the_store_after/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s insanity and so completely inconsiderate just so she could \u201ctry things on\u201d \n\nNot ok. She should be apologizing to YOU.", "NTA obviously.  She's treating you like a servant who is paid to wait around and not complain.  She is the one who owes you an apology for making you wait 1.5 hours, not the other way around.", "NTA who goes in to pick something up then starts trying on clothes??? And she wasn\u2019t stranded\ud83e\udd23 she was ~20 minutes from home with her mom", "At first I started reading the post and was determined that you would be the asshole\u2026 up until I saw your wife decided to leave you in the car with your hungry and tired children who were screaming and crying while she spent an hour and a half trying clothes on which was not originally the plan.\n\nYour wife is an asshole for being selfish and not thinking of you and your kids. She and your MIL are the assholes here.\n\nClearly, you are NTA.", "NTA - Obviously. She was disrespectful and she had an alternate ride home.\n\nI would have left long before you did.", "NTA. Your wife, though... eesh... that is insanely selfish of her. The fact that you waited that long shows you just how patient you are. I would have left after 30.", "Nta. Dang your wife was selfish here\u2026 you did not abandon her, she abandoned you.", "NTA\n\nFrom personal point of view I would be fucking livid if someone made me wait 1.5 hours, and even said, \"I'm going to be a while,\" only to throw a tantrum at me when I went home.\n\nFrankly, double down and say not only was your wife egregiously selfish, but that the woman who raised her to apparently be like that has absolutely zero to say that you give a shit about.", "NTA. She should\u2019ve considered her children\u2019s well being before her fashion. Also your time and the gas etc. very rude and I would\u2019ve left after 30 mins so you\u2019re a better partner than I.", "NTA. I dunno what was going through you wife's mind thinking she can just leave you and the kids in the car. Then the \"oh I saw something I like. And my mom showed up. We're shopping now\" bullshit. Sounds like she was just taking advantage of you for having the kids in the car. If she knew she was gonna take longer she should've just texted you saying to just go home and she catch an Uber. Imagine how she'd act if you did that shit to her.\n\nYour wife is definitely the AH here. Oh and your MIL, too. It's bad enough their selfish actions were disrespectful to you , but inconsiderate to her very young children. It's not like they were 11-12 years old. A toddler and an infant.", "NTA. you have to take care of your kids, number one. and number two, that\u2019s just rude and inconsiderate. her mom was there. she had a ride back. there is no reason she had to make you wait like that", "You can't possibly think you're the asshole here. No one else will either. NTA.", "NTA.  Sod that for a game of soldiers.", "NTA. She said about 15 or so minutes. She could have called and said mom showed up, we\u2019re trying stuff on. You tried to get a hold of her, and chose to ignore.", "NTA. \n\nSeriously it is bad enough if she left you by yourself, but she also left y\u2019all\u2019s kids. While she went shopping. Who seriously does that? This would have been a different story if you only waited 10-20 minutes and drove off, but the complete lack of disregard of you and the kids. Especially with her banality ignoring your calls. Yeah that\u2019s pretty messed up.", "NTA but she certainly is.", "Um NTA. I probably would have left the moment her mom showed up. \u201cSounds like you have a ride.\u201d", "She sounds like a terrible parent.  Who abandons their newborn like that?  And doesn't come back to feed them when they know they are screaming to be fed? \n\nHorrible woman.  \n\nYou are nta.   But you might be if you allow your children to keep being treated like that by her.", "NTA, she has horrible communication skills and a general lack of respect. You have two small children, one of which is dependent on her - and she just leaves you hanging with them to go shopping with her mom while you have crying children. How did her mom know she was there?", "NTA and you are WAY more patient than I would have been! I would have left after about 30 minutes.", "NTA, your wife and her mom are though. They don't think that kids need to eat?", "NTA. If she wanted to shop and chat. You house is 15 minutes away. Maybe if she told you she was gonna shop, you could\u2019ve taken the kids home let them nap eat whatever, and then gone and picked her up when she was ready I get getting kids in and out of a car is a hassle, but not as bad as waiting in a car with them hungry and tired and cranky and screaming for an undetermined amount of time.", "NTA. She knew the knew you and the kids were in the car but she took her sweet time without a care in the world. She's in the wrong there, not you.", "NTA, but your wife is, no further explanation needed. Just oh wow.", "Seriously you think YOU are the AH here? Your wife is a major jerk. Her and her mother. That was beyond inconsiderate. You waited way longer than I would have. That she had the nerve to just decide to have a bit of time to herself while telling you 10 minutes. 10 minutes. 10 minutes. Nope. You were not out of line. She was a liar and selfish.", "Ask her how she would feel if she had the kids and you said you'd be gone 10 minutes but didn't return until an hour and a half later.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I don't understand why she didn't tell you to go home once her mom arrived, heck, once she called to ask her mom to join her. You are a saint for waiting as long as you did.", "NTA. Your wife is a selfish, inconsiderate AH.  She owes you a huge apology.  Leaving you there for 30mins would have been an AH move, over 1.5hrs is unforgivable considering you had your young children and it was dinner time, plus she is breastfeeding the baby, so you couldn't do anything there. Has your wife always been this selfish & inconsiderate?", "INFO: is she normally this dismissive of you and the kids? Cuz if she is, you have a LOT bigger problem than two tired/hangry children. This sort of thing doesn\u2019t speak well of her qualifications to be Mom/Spouse of the Year.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
