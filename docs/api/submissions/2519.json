{"id": 2519, "submission_id": "yxe0pd", "title": "AITA for leaving my wife at the store after waiting 1.5 hours for her?", "selftext": "TA obviously.\n\nSo today was my day off during the week which I like to use for cleaning the house, running errands, and relaxing in the evening. So my wife and I were running errands with our two kids (2YO and 3 months) and everything was going fine. We got groceries, washed the car, and made a stop at a store about 20-30 minutes away from home. It\u2019s getting close to the time we have dinner so we start heading home. As we\u2019re going home my wife says we need to stop by a department store so she can pick up something she ordered that they shipped to the store. That\u2019s fine the store is on the way home about 15 minutes from our house. My wife assures me it\u2019ll only be like 10 minutes. That\u2019s cool. \n\nAs we\u2019re driving to the store the older child falls asleep because they didn\u2019t get their nap, so I tell her to run in and I\u2019ll stay in the car with the kids. She goes in, 10 minutes goes by, 20 minutes goes by. No prob. Maybe there\u2019s a line. 30 minutes, 40 minutes, she\u2019s still gone. I call her to see if she\u2019s okay, no answer. I call her again at 50 minutes and she says she hasn\u2019t picked the thing up because she saw something she wanted to try on so she\u2019s been doing that. I ask her to finish up so we can go home because our kid is tired and needs dinner and bed. I wait. Still nothing. \n\nAfter an hour I call again and she says she\u2019s gonna be a while, her mom showed up and they\u2019re trying stuff on. I tell her to please hurry, the car has been running, gas is expensive, and our kids are starting to wake up. Again she says she\u2019s almost done. During this time both of our kids wake up and start screaming/crying. I get the older one calmed down, but the younger is hungry and my boobs don\u2019t work that way so I can\u2019t feed him.\n\nIt\u2019s been 1.5 hours. I call her and tell her I\u2019m leaving with the kids because they\u2019re starving and tired. She can get a ride home with her mom who lives near us. She huffs and says she\u2019s coming so I wait another 10 minutes and she\u2019s still not there so I leave. \n\nAs I\u2019m driving I get angry calls from her and MIL about how could I abandon my wife at the store like that? My MIL says I was an AH and way out of line. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1668652361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxe0pd/aita_for_leaving_my_wife_at_the_store_after/", "score": 717, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How often does your wife get to do things by herself without the kids? Maybe she saw something she liked and wanted to try it. She shouldn\u2019t have wasted so much time, but new moms don\u2019t often get some me-time. Still, you are NTA, OP.", "OP, if this story is real you should be REALLY concerned about your wife's complete disregard about your children in this situation (forget not seeing an issue with making someone wait that long AND being angry about it afterwards)\n\nThis is not normal and I can't believe this is the only issue you are having.", "I thought maybe something had happened to her and you abandoned her. But no, she got distracted and (checks notes) her mother was with her!!! She is a big fat AH. Would it have killed her to call and say \"bumped into mum, would you be an angel and take the kids home so we can hang out\". You are seriously NTA.", "NTA, beyond everything else, what sort of breastfeeding mother (assuming your wife is the one breastfeeding) is happy to leave their 3 month old for 1.5 hours knowing they need a feed. Wtf.", "Nta", "Nta I would love to trade abandonment issues with your wife! Jk I wouldn\u2019t survive being that sensitive and inconsiderate.", "NTA \n\nI would have left after first call, when she told you she was playing dress up, your wife is TA", "NTA", "Why would you even wait that long? She knows she can take advantage of you. Grow some backbone for you and your kids. After 30 minutes I would have been gone.", "Who the hell makes their partner, or really anyone, in the car for that long? Take the children out of the equation, and she\u2019s still a massive asshole. The only surprising thing to me is that OP stayed that long I would have left much earlier. Wife\u2019s behavior is completely absurd.", "A mom who just happened to show up accidentally on purpose.", "The thing is, wife could've easily told him that she'd take a while, and then he'd have been able to plan his time accordingly rather than sit in a running car with his kids for 1.5 hours.\n\nIf she's gonna be longer than 10 mins she could've texted or called.\n\nWife is TA.", "Ya your wife is the AH. You NTA. I wouldn't have waited 1.5 hrs for anyone. If I did this my hubby would go scorched earth on me.", "> At first I started reading the post and was determined that you would be the asshole\u2026\n\nYou started reading a post about someone being made to wait for 1.5 hours and you were determined THEY would be the asshole?", "Yeah agreed. Once the half hour was up I\u2019d have been gone.", "No he's not. He's enabling her to treat his time like shit. That's not being a good partner. That's being a doormat.", "I wouldn't be livid because I would have been gone after the first call for sure!", "LOL I would have been TA because I wouldn\u2019t have lasted 30 minutes waiting.\n\nNTA", "Or even just as a person in general. theres a difference between catching up with a friend in a store vs having an impromptu shopping day with that friend.", "Lol, wife decided to just stroll around without informing her family and OP needs to learn to communicate? I'm sure you or I would be fine sitting in the car without heating but they had two small kids, should they be cold because wife can't be bothered?", "I agree. It\u2019s as if the wife just decided his time is hers to waste. I don\u2019t think she should just unilaterally get to decide that 1.5 hour of his time should be spent sitting in a car. It is blatantly disrespectful.", "He had the car running the entire time to keep the kids warm. That keeps the groceries warm too.", "I stored left over mashed potatoes from a restaurant in my car from like November to March or April my fresan year of college \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02 could've brought them in and heated them up like they're fresh out the freezer", "Heat. At my house it was a high of 30 degrees. I wouldn't have run the car for an hour and a half though.", "Idling uses next to nothing.  Like so little petrol it's not worth even wasting thought about.\n\nBoth my cars (a diesel truck and a turbocharged golf GTI) use about 1-1.5L of fuel per hour idling.  \n\nSo with USA gas prices that's about $1.\nAnd the equivalent climate impact of driving 3-4 miles, likely less since you're not accelerating.\n\n\nLike don't do it for hours every day, but it's not a big deal.", "But he wasn't expecting it to be an hour and a half. Wife told him a quick in and out."]}
