So my wife and I were running errands with our two kids (2YO and 3 months) and everything was going fine. We got groceries, washed the car, and made a stop at a store about 20-30 minutes away from home. It\u2019s getting close to the time we have dinner so we start heading home. As we\u2019re going home my wife says we need to stop by a department store so she can pick up something she ordered that they shipped to the store. That\u2019s fine the store is on the way home about 15 minutes from our house. My wife assures me it\u2019ll only be like 10 minutes. That\u2019s cool. \n\nAs we\u2019re driving to the store the older child falls asleep because they didn\u2019t get their nap, so I tell her to run in and I\u2019ll stay in the car with the kids. She goes in, 10 minutes goes by, 20 minutes goes by. No prob. Maybe there\u2019s a line. 30 minutes, 40 minutes, she\u2019s still gone. I call her to see if she\u2019s okay, no answer. I call her again at 50 minutes and she says she hasn\u2019t picked the thing up because she saw something she wanted to try on so she\u2019s been doing that. I ask her to finish up so we can go home because our kid is tired and needs dinner and bed. I wait. Still nothing. \n\nAfter an hour I call again and she says she\u2019s gonna be a while, her mom showed up and they\u2019re trying stuff on. I tell her to please hurry, the car has been running, gas is expensive, and our kids are starting to wake up. Again she says she\u2019s almost done. During this time both of our kids wake up and start screaming/crying. I get the older one calmed down, but the younger is hungry and my boobs don\u2019t work that way so I can\u2019t feed him.\n\nIt\u2019s been 1.5 hours. I call her and tell her I\u2019m leaving with the kids because they\u2019re starving and tired. She can get a ride home with her mom who lives near us. She huffs and says she\u2019s coming so I wait another 10 minutes and she\u2019s still not there so I leave. \n\nAs I\u2019m driving I get angry calls from her and MIL about how could I abandon my wife at the store like that? My MIL says I was an AH and way out of line. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1668652361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxe0pd/aita_for_leaving_my_wife_at_the_store_after/", "score": 3829, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
