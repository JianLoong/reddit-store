I think it could have much different if he had brought it up initially.\n\nEdit: just wanted to say that I'm not trying to say she is completely not at fault for this. I think ESH. I just wanted to point out that they both could have made better decisions here.", "what happened to your comment about feeling sorry for people like me? it was so touching.", "Perhaps he needs to think more about staying in his marriage rather than where to stay on vacation with a person that he seems to be on the other side of the spectrum and no longer seeing value in the middle ground \u2026he is already going on the trips he\u2019d really like to, just with out the person that\u2019s going to ruin his time.", "It's not complex: because this sub hates men and anything men do is wrong.\n\nDude plans fancy vacations and wife moans and complains the entire time; then dude goes and has fun w/ wife on local entertainment and doesn't complain.  AITA: the dude is wrong.", "It does not sound like that to me", "Couldn't you just say \"more than two years\"? Lol.", "Yeah, but at that point it was probably a \u201cno point in bringing it up now\u201d situation. Basically, my point is it\u2019s kinda crazy to consider that \u201ckeeping score\u201d no matter how you look at it. If it happened, then it happened.", "I don't live in NYC but I love visiting and you can't get me in Times Square either. The most fun I've had is running around with friends that live there and checking out their favorite local spots. Places that are not on my radar, little pockets of the city I would never know about. I did enjoy all the touristy stuff, ONCE. Don't need to go back to the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building.", "He\u2019s only complaining to us. Not her", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he does, there\u2019s a difference between enjoying yourself but being disappointed and complaining to him the whole vacation and then complaining to your family about how awful it was.", "This is an excellent way to plan a vacation that takes everyone\u2019s preferences into consideration. That is how a marriage or partnership should work.", "> Couldn't you just say \"more than two years\"? Lol.\n\nI think it\u2019s fascinating that you\u2019re policing my language when you meant \u201cdecades\u201d.", "Yeah that is true, I don't really see it as keeping score in this case either honestly, but I can kinda see how it could be taken as keeping score. Either way, it clearly bothered him, so he should have brought it up. And, she shouldn't be complaining or getting offended by what he had to say either", "I can see both sides.\n\nI live in a touristy city and have already done most of the touristy things and seen the major museums. On the other hand most of my friends and family have done neither of those things so we end up doing the 6 hour landmark combo on day one and museums after that.\n\nI enjoy helping people I love discover the city, but I admit, I'll bow out of touristy, all-day attractions like museums.\n\nIt's not about not enjoying the city you live in as much as it's about paying $20 and standing in line for an hour to go see something you already saw 3 times.\n\nu/jamesblondny can back me up here, but I much prefer people's 2nd or 3rd trips where we can go see stuff off the beaten path, local attractions or even leave the city to visit other places.\n\nThe issue isn't not wanting to show off your city, it's paying $50+ to see the most crowded, commercialized and overrated parts of it.", "WTF KittinAnn? I appreciate where I live very very much and I take advantage of everything here I love. But thanks for looking down on me, I hope it made you feel good.", "The second you mention the reliable narrator issue, anything and everything mentioned goes out the window and at that point why are you even here?", "Its also something I would find infuriating when she complains about *his* plans and the general implication is that he sucks at planning or doesn't know her well enough to not have her miserable during a vacation and how he needs to plan bigger and more extravagant vacations, so when she gets a chance to plan her own and show him what she likes, they go to a mall.\n\nOP just seems beaten down and while I might agree that there kind of is a point of hypocrisy to his complaints about his wife's complaints while he does the same, it not really the same at its base. OP's complaints come from years of effort that just gets shit on not only to him, but to all their friends and family. Things she apparently does herself to a much worse degree and with years of much worse reactions.\n\nOn the surface, any wrongs on both sides argued look the same but its obviously not if OP's description is accurate.", "\"And every single time she has spent the entire trip complaining.\"\n\nI'm fairly certain that doesn't mean his wife tells her friends how bad it was. I could be wrong though.", "Where are you getting \"sulk\" \n\nRead better.", "You are related to my ILs?", "For me there\u2019s a difference between sitting around and doing nothing on vacation(no responsibilities) and at home (I really should work on organizing the garage and that locust stump isn\u2019t going to remove itself, also I need to add an outdoor outlet for the patio and put more plywood down in the attic)", "Thank you! I should be in a museum with how fascinating I am.", "Being an unreliable narrator doesn't mean the person is actively lying or not telling any truths. \n\nIt's a nuance thing. There are tells that can show a narrator is unreliable. That means they may be contradicting themselves, paraphrasing stuff that was said, makes suspicious excuses etc.\n\nIt doesn't mean the whole post is a lie. Just that the story is presented in a more subjective way.", "Because the rules of the sub are to assume the poster is telling the truth. We are assuming the OP IS a reliable narrator and placing judgement based off the post and follow up comments, as well as potentially prior post history.", "\"and then telling everyone how bad a time she had\" is at the end of the post", "I didn\u2019t say you were fascinating. Your reading comprehension needs work.", "My point exactly. What the person above was suggesting defeats the entire point of this sub lol. Its pretty easy to allege OP is lying considering we have no proof and neither will they if they don't wanna doxx themselves.", "Good point. But I suspect that her complaining directly to OP weighs more heavily on him.\n\nIt's posts like these that remind me why not marrying was the best choice. I still have an endlessly complaining mother, and I wouldn't have survived this long by adding a complaining wife to the mix. So OP thank you for posting this.", "This totally.  I'm guessing he loves adventure (the helicopters, volcanos) and she's a chill on the beach type.  Nothing wrong with either, they'll just need to compromise for each  to be happy.  Assuming that's the goal.", "She got so mad he couldn\u2019t sleep on the couch, he had to go to the guest house. The horror.", "Maybe they need a trip to visit the Titanic...not sayin just saying.", "That's how billionaires end up in a tin can at the bottom of the Atlantic.", "It sounds like they have two different vacation styles and don\u2019t discuss that at all. He likes action, she likes leisure. Any tourist spot can accommodate both of those.  I\u2019ve never been on vacation with a partner, but even with friends we ask each other \u201cwhat things do you want to do?\u201d.  Seems like they lack communication here.", "It\u2019s also weird that he\u2019s going on a bunch of elaborate trips without her. Something off with OP. I don\u2019t trust this narrative at all.", "We are debating how we are going to afford our 3rd/surprise child lol nvm a vacation \ud83d\ude02", "It's basic pattern recognition and responding to it.  I'm wondering how many of the people judging E-S-H have had a similar miserable experience... and it is miserable.\n\nThere comes a point where the complaining isn't going to be because the holiday sucks, but because it was the other person that booked it... and they can't have a win... and I'm English, complaining is in the blood.\n\nHad similar with an ex but if only it was just holidays.  Anything nice, any romantic or thoughtful gesture of any kind or size, got absolutely shat on.  Because I daren't think that maybe I've actually done ok and made her happy... that gives away too much \"power.\"  OP's wife doesn't sound *that* bad but it sounds like she's at least ruminating about entering the same ball park.", "Insane Reddit moment", "I knew I\u2019d see this question here lmao. It\u2019s the go to for when you have no valid points to make on the situation but still want paint who you want the bad person.", "yep, a giant gaping one at that", "What does your imagination have to do with anything?", "His complaints appear to be limited to reddit, hers were spoken during planned activities- not the same", "Which is the basis of all happy marriages.", "What I am getting is that he plans these trips, she complains. He tweaks the next trip mindful of what she did and didn't like about the last one, and she still complains. They need to sit down together and plan trips. Put in things that they both want to do. Because I gotta say, if I ever make it to Hawaii I want to see it all, not just the ocean from my hotel room."]}
