Why Not plan a vacation together? You can both Bring in ideas and Look Up places where you want to Go or what to do. That's what my hubby an i did before our Kids an now we plan the Trips the Same way but with the Kids Input.", "ESH.   You both sound like you complain about the others' planned vacations.  You both sound exhausting.", "You sound similar to your wife. *She planned a trip to Hawaii. Which I thoroughly enjoyed. But we didn't do anything great.*", "ESH. Did you ask your wife what she would enjoy doing on a vacation, or did you just plan what _you_ like to do? Why didn\u2019t you advocate for yourself on the vacation _she_ planned to make sure that you had some experiences you would also enjoy? You both sound terrible at communication, but at least she\u2019s trying to ask for what she wants.", "ESH\u2026. Seems the simplest thing is for you to compromise.\n\nYou like expensive holidays which is normal if you can afford it but mayb you are just overbooking your time when there. Having fancy dinner every day can be exhausting too.\n\nYour wife likely just like to take it slow and chill doing nothing like your Hawaii holiday. In the end just plan a few days of stuff and rest chill or you can go explore how u want some days.", "ESH. Your wife and you sound exhausting to be around. Keeping score, complaining about each other's choices and frankly, it seems like you have terrible communication between each other.

I am in Australia, but feel free to take me on one of your vacations.  I love exploring new places.   Couldn't imagine anything worse than going on a holiday to somewhere beautiful like Hawaii to just go shopping.  I do like adventure holidays though; like hiking the Inca Trail, hiking Volcanoes in cental america, even Sand boarding down one in Nicaragua, snorkelling with whale sharks.", "NTA, she literally asked you why you thought she would enjoyed it and you told her the truth. Sometimes the truth hurts and that is her problem in reacting to that. Why did you marry to this women who doesn\u2019t appreciate the time in spending time with you and acting like your her valet or butler? She is NOT entitled to go on a vacation whenever she demands. If she wishes, she can do so under her own salary. You did good to stop the enablement.", "Info : Is there any communication in your relationship or do you both just complain about the other without trying to communicate what you would like or ask what they would like?", "esh", "YTA\n\nShe doesn't seem to like your vacations, you don't seem to like hers.\n\nHave either of you considered communicating and planning a vacation together rather than expecting the other to do all the work?\n\nHawaii could have been a great vacation for you both if you had perhaps suggested you organise a couple of day trips for while you were there rather than just leaving it entirely to your partner. Similarly, if she had gotten any input on your travel plans and suggested a day or two to better suit her preferences then you both would have enjoyed that trip better.\n\nSo for just shifting your focus to going on trips with other people rather than the person you choose to be with, yes, you are the asshole. Doing this occasionally would be fair, but not to the exclusion of your partner and shifting the entire responsibility for holiday planning to them - and then complaining it wasn't to your preference.", "You could plan the holidays together.
