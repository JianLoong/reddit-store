My neighbours are out during the day. However, they have started leaving a note on their gate to have all their parcels to be delivered to my house (I only learned this today thanks to a delivery driver). They haven't asked permission. At first I was okay with taking them as they only recently moved in. Without coming across like a not very nice neighbour I've taken the parcels (even this evening). However, I am frequently on calls with CEO's of FTSE100/ Fortune 500 companies and this is becoming disruptive. Any ideas on how I can deal with this neighbour? I have no idea of knowing who the parcel is for until I get to either 1) the intercom or 2) let the delivery driver to the door to know that its not for me. I am quite tired of this. WIBTA if I stopped taking delivery of their parcels? If I wouldn't be the asshole how should I address this. The husband is a genuinely nice guy however his Mrs thinks she is a 3rd cousin removed from His Majesty. Help?\n\nWIBTA to tell them to stop getting their parcels delivered or just refusing to accept them?  It sounds like an obvious answer, but I just don't want the friction.\n\nUpdate: I took the comments on board and I messaged the husband. He outright denied there being a sign (I saw it myself after 2 delivery drivers mentioned it!) and said they\u2019d redirect their packages in the future. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s the end of it.
