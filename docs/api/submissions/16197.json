She took the kids, moved in with her AP and relocated to the US after that. My partner agreed with this arrangement because he was working overseas on roster and would visit his kids during roster break every 2 months for two weeks at a time. During that visit, he would stay in the Ex\u2019s house because he did not want to disturb his kids\u2019 life by bringing the kids to stay somewhere. It worked even though he never liked staying in someone\u2019s home and hates his Ex's behavior. Then I started dating my partner 3 years ago and recently we took his kids to live with us fulltime in Canada.\n\nCurrent issue, the Ex now wants to stay in our home while visiting the kids for 2 weeks at a time, 4 times a year. Now, I am not comfortable at all with this arrangement as I do not want a stranger with her toddler in my home for an extended period. I said, she is welcome to come to take and drop the kids but not to stay. But the Ex is now furious that she is not welcome in her kids home. My partner agrees with me and understands where I am coming from though he feels bad obviously because he stayed in their home while visiting his kids.\n\nHowever, my logic is that I took no part creating this situation and my love and care extends to my partner and the kids only. The Ex and her AP might felt guilty and were fine with the previous arrangement, but I think I have zero obligation to make her feel welcome, especially at the expense of my comfort in my own home.\n\nSo AITA for setting the boundary and not letting my partner\u2019s Ex stay with us?", "created_utc": 1683002744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135bh3k/aita_for_not_letting_my_partners_ex_to_stay_in/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think she prefers to stay with us because her and her mom also don't get along well.*\n\nShe can suck it up for 8 weeks out of the year and stay at her mother's place. She can visit with the kids, take them places, have them spend the night at their grandparents (her mom's house). She can do everything she wants to do- by staying at her mom's. You don't owe her 8 weeks a year of her staying at your house so she can see her kids.  Her mom lives 5min down the road from you. Don't let someone whom you have no obligation to (you and your partner have an obligation to the kids, not the ex), control the comfort of your own home.  \n\nNTA", "NTA!\n\nIf it was just him in the house, then he\u2019d be the AH for not returning the favor and letting her stay. But it\u2019s NOT just him in the house; it\u2019s YOUR home too. And you don\u2019t know this woman. You don\u2019t owe her anything. And she is not entitled to YOUR space.", "NTA\n\nShe cheated and she might have felt guilty.\n\nBut her mother lives 5 minutes away from your house so i think she's trying to make a power move by insisting you host her and the person who she cheated with.\n\nShe might want to show everyone that your boyfriend forgave her so her AP and her be \"accepted\" as a couple by her family and friends who disagreed with her behaviour.\n\nShe can travel 5 minutes to take the kids.", "NTA.  There are two VERY notable differences in this situation. 1) the reason your husband stayed at his ex's home was so that the KIDS weren't inconvenienced/disrupted, but his ex is wanting to stay with you so that SHE isn't inconvenienced.  2) Your husband stayed at the ex's house, just him.  He didn't have any new family to tote along with him. His ex is expecting you to not host just her, but also her toddler. I'm no expert on kids, but housing a toddler seems like a lot more effort than housing an adult.  Why can't the toddler stay with dad? Or are you expected to host ALL THREE of them each time?", "Nta. Why is she pushing to stay with you guys. You\u2019re not responsible for her living arrangements for these monthly two week visits she\u2019s trying to make. You also mentioned her mother lives 5 minutes away. Solved", "NTA. Cheaters suck and you shouldn't be inconvenienced for her sake. If she wanted to feel welcome in her kids home she shouldn't have broken it.", "NTA if someone cheats in a relationship with kids (barring extreme circumstances such as abuse) then them getting the shit end of the deal with everything related to the kids is deserved, since that person is the reason that the divorce happened.", "NTA. Your partner was single when he stayed with her. She can't expect you to host her and her toddler for weeks at a time. There are extended stay hotels.", "NTA for not wanting her to actually live in the house for a period of time, although as the kids' mother certainly she does have the right to see her children unless there is a legal reason she can't (it also doesn't sound like she's any kind of bad mother so that wouldn't prevent her from visiting either). You do I think need to figure out a good way for her to see children while also protecting the rights of your own home.\n\nAlso, I don't know what \"AP\" means, I didn't put it in info though because it shouldn't impact my answer to the question.", "NTA. She is acting as if she'd agree if she was in the same situation as you are.", "NTA. She cheated, this whole situation is her fault, she doesn\u2019t get to be making demands.", "Changing judgment to NTA given info in OP'S comment below. Ex can house herself and the kids. \nOriginal post was:\nNAH, you don't have to share your home with your partner's ex, and her kids do have a right to spend live-in time with her. They grew up with her. Plainly there will be some costs involved in spending time with kids across an international border. . Alternative, affordable accommodation is hard to come by but maybe there are some creative solutions for the kids to spend sizable chunks of time with her while she's able to visit.", "I hesitate to call you an arsehole but she's not really a stranger. She's the mother of the kids you live with full time.", "NTA, I do not think you are an AH for setting a boundary and ensuring your home is a safe space for you and your family. I think it is important to ensure what boundaries you create and what precedent you set.   \nI do however wonder if this could potentially create a hostile or upsetting environment for your 10 and 11 year olds. May be you and your partner can help find a local rental property nearby for the ex (not pay for it, but just as scouting options/mental labour).", "I'm gonna say NAH.  You're just a third party to their agreement and she is only expecting to be extended the same courtesy that she extended to your partner for years.  \n\nMaybe you can get her a decent accommodation nearby, I know it's an expense, but I'm quite sure she didn't exactly love having him stay at her place for 2 week stretches when he visited.\n\nEdit: mistakenly though he cheated on her.  Still, she always hosted him so it is decent to host in return. Failing that, set up accommodation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From my understanding, her AP works a lot so she has to bring the toddler with her even though they have a live-in nanny with them.\n\nI agree with you, having a toddler in the house is a lot of work.

What a control freak! Sorry you have to deal with that!", "Interesting, never heard that acronym before. Doesn't change my answer, but good to know if I ever see it in the future.", "That's relevant info! Easy peasy, if grandma doesn't want to host her family, then Ex can afford to house herself and her children during her parenting times. Best wishes with this very unusual and intertwined situation.", "Well, her lack of chumminess with her mom is not your problem, so she has other options and is her problem.

I'd consider editing your OP to include that, as it's pretty relevant information - namely, that Ex has another place to stay near you. \n\nShe seems fine asking you to suck it up because of the kids, yet is unwilling to do so herself by forcing herself to stay with her mom? Tough shit. \n\nIf she wanted to feel welcome in her children's home without pushback, then perhaps she shouldn't have been the reason her children's home and her home are no longer the same.", "NTA you're not comfortable, it's your house she can find an alternative."]}
