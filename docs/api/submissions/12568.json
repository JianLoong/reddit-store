Growing up my mother was very loving and supportive to me and my two biological brothers. However my biological father choose to drink, neglect us, and do some other not so very good things. When I was 10 my mother remarried to my dad. He has shown me how a man should treat a woman and has been a great father to all of us kids. Around the time that I was 12 I completely cut my biological father out of my life. No longer wanting to deal with him. My brothers still have I think good relationships ship with our biological father. Around the time I was 15, my brothers started to push me to give my biological father a second chance. After saying no many times, I be grudgingly agreed to try and give him a second chance. We had awkward conversations and a few lunches. My biological father still didn\u2019t seem interested in me like when I was younger. And was still doing things he did when I was kid. So are relationship has never gotten any better. Since I turned 18 I\u2019ve been wanting to change my last name to my dad\u2019s last name. In fact since I was 12 I\u2019ve wanted my dad to adopt me. My family just didn\u2019t have the money and my biological father would never allow it. Now that I am 20 and have a good paying full time job. I have been working towards this dream of mine to change my last name. I had been trying to keep it a secret but like any secret it got out. One of my brother\u2019s thinks what I am doing is good while the other is thinks I am being the b-word. My biological father is also very unhappy and this I am being A-hole. But I don\u2019t feel like I am and I think my dad has been a better father to me than my biological father ever has been.

Being an adult, you can change your name to whatever you want.  Here, however, you seemingly have great reasons to choose one dad's name over another.  It would be great to get support from all sides, but that looks like it's not happening.  So, you just do you, and don't look back.  You have to make yourself happy.", "NT.  Go for it.", "Your life.

I grew up in a somewhat similar situation - bio dad not around, never got a good replacement, unfortunately. When I was in elementary school I asked to have my name changed to my mother's maiden name. Had to go before a judge and everything. I kept my last name even when I got married and am glad I did because we are now divorcing. It's your name, you do what you want. I think it's a loving tribute to your actual father.", "NTA.  It isn't his name anymore, it's yours.", "NTA.  I'm sure your dad will be touched!\n\nYou might consider asking him if he'd like to adopt you.  Adult adoptions are very simple because your bio dad doesn't have to be involved at all - just you and your dad.  And your name can be changed as part of the same process.\n\nFather's Day is coming up.  You could get the paperwork together and have it in a folder.  Then ask him verbally or written in a Father's Day card if he'd become your official dad by adopting you.  If he says yes, then after you both stop crying you can pull out the folder.", "I\u2019ve tried to but they call me a liar or that I imagined all those things that actually happened to us. My biological father always denies he was ever a bad father to us.", "You tell 'em, Don Draper.", "Go LC with them if they continue what has your mam said about it", "I would go LC or NC with them for the sake of your sanity.

Then to change my last name.", "Good on her! If needs be you can go LC/NC with your brothers and your bio dad!", "NTA but it\u2019s going to be a headache to change over all of your IDs, passports, banking info, multiple insurances etc and then if you get married you\u2019re likely to change your name again so rinse and repeat. A lot of applications ask for previous names/maiden names and it\u2019s another thing that can cause delays in the future when you need applications processed. You\u2019re only 20 and you have a lifetime of applications/forms/documents to fill out don\u2019t make it harder than it needs to be. My suggestion Go get your stepdads last name tattooed on you that way it\u2019s extremely personal instead of the bureaucratic mess that comes with changing your name!", "NTA you're an adult and deserve to have the last name that you want", "Raising a glass in toast to your new name, OP! What a beautiful plan. Chosenfamily is so often way better than bio-family. This is a fitting tribute to the man who actually is your dad, and to who you really are.", "Sounds like your bio dad was a better father to sons than to you. Unfortunately it's all too common. It's possible that your brothers had a better experience of him but it's not transferable: just because he was nicer to them doesn't mean you must love him. Say as much to them and if they continue invalidating your experience, consider going LC. Changing your name can be pretty empowering, and very much worth dealing with documents. I wish you the best with it!", "Nta", "NTA. I changed my last name to my mum\u2019s maiden name as an 18th birthday present to myself coz my maternal grandfather raised my brother & I with my mum. Haven\u2019t seen the sperm donor in 21years this year. I changed my name when I did, even though mum told me she couldn\u2019t change hers back until my brother could also change his & he\u2019s 3 years younger than me. We didn\u2019t want him to be the only one left with the sperm donor\u2019s name- so for 3 years it was my Pop & I with his surname and Mum & bro with the other name- but I\u2019ve never regretted my decision. Do what\u2019s right to you \u2764\ufe0f", "Never been in your position but to me, the person that raised you, comforted you, cuddled you, tucked you in at night, read you stories, took you to school, helped with your homework, attended piano recitals, violin lessons, tennis lessons etc and came to your graduation is more of a parent than someone who has been absent for most of your life.\n\nYou clearly have a great deal of love and respect for the man you call 'dad'. Considering the horror stories on this sub about blended families, it sounds like both of you are very lucky to be in each other's lives.\n\nYour brothers can make their own decisions but the opinion of one (and your bio father) does not override or outweigh your own thoughts about, and feelings for, your dad.\n\nIf changing your name would make you happy and being adopted by him would make you happier, it is your life to live so go ahead and do it. You are not forcing this on your brother so he should keep his thoughts to himself.\n\nNTA and very good luck to you all.", "NTA sounds like your brother's don't actually want a relationship with you anymore than your bio-dad does. If they did, they'd respect your decisions. I'm so glad your mom found someone great who treats her and you wonderfully!", "NTA. You're an adult do what you want. Lord knows your bio dad did.", "NTA. Don't listen to them. Simple.", "NTA, your bio dad sounds like a narc.", "NTA but I would like to make a suggestion.  You make it sound like adoption would have been on the table had your family had the money.  Would you think about looking into adoption now and putting your money towards that?  And if it was something your dad would be interested in, maybe present it to him as a gift?", "I\u2019m betting sperm donor wouldn\u2019t bat an eye if she changed her name after getting married\n\nBut since he\u2019s being called out on being a subpar father, he\u2019s getting all up in his feels lol"]}
