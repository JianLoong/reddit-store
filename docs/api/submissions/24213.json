My mom kind of has a track record of bad birthdays.

Like one year she did seafood and margaritas (I'm allergic to seafood and I was too young to drink and definitely wasn't allowed so she just told me to chill out in my room for the day), plus she'd make me do hours of cleaning and decorating to prepare for it. Basically my birthdays have never been about me but her instead, so over the years resentment kind of build up.\n\nWell I guess I finally ended up snapping this time around. She was asking me what I wanted for my birthday, but then would try to convince me that I wanted something else (like makeup or heels, when I never wear either, I have a pretty specific hobby/collection that I won't mention for anonymity but basically all I wanted was something related to it and she just kept pressuring me into what she wanted me to have). She asked what cake I wanted and I offered a few options of ones I liked, I don't like dense sweet cakes but lighter stuff, I especially hate chocolate and buttercream frosting (I just can't stand too sweet of stuff especially frosting and I've always hated chocolate). \n\nWell come my birthday she got me heels that I'll never wear both because I don't and can't wear them (failed surgeries when I was younger has me unable to walk properly and I have to wear orthopedic shoes) that were also the wrong size and... a chocolate buttercream cake. Last year there wasn't a cake because she said she tried to bake one from a box but my brother squished it so she threw it away and my gift was her old coffee maker, still dirty. She kept pushing me to eat some and I snapped and asked her why she even bothers asking what I want when she clearly doesn't care and if she can't even make the smallest effort for me then to just leave me alone and let me do my own thing for my birthday and not to expect to see me on them anymore and left. Of course the family is now freaking out about me being disrespectful and she's both crying and mad at me for disrespecting her too along with \"embarrassing her in front of her friends\".

Sorry you have such an absolute shit show for a mother.  The rest of your family appear to be your mothers flying monkeys. Don\u2019t worry about what they think, if they\u2019re condoning your mothers actions, they are just as bad as her.\n\nYou don\u2019t say how old you are, but remember that one day you get to leave that house. Go to college and meet some sane people.  Focus on you and make your life a success and look forward to one day going no contact with your mother.\n\nI would start planning now and get hold of all your important documents and put them in a safe place.", "When I read the title, I was about to call you a spoiled brat and end my judgement there. But, after reading through the entire story.. you've really had a poor track with birthday parties and gifts with her.

I'd rather get no gift than get a gift that's clearly meant for the gift-giver. NTA", "NTA. I started out firmly thinking the opposite, but after reading the whole thing \u2026 I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve had to deal with this. \nI don\u2019t think you really went too far in what you said \u2026 maybe not far enough. The sad thing is, she won\u2019t see where she could have done things differently. She will just see you as misbehaving, because she lacks insight. \nGoing forward, you should plan your own bday celebrations. Have it your way. Maybe invite her, maybe not. Up to you. She will likely throw a pity party for herself during that time. You aren\u2019t going to get what you need from her because she is unable to give what she doesn\u2019t have. Good luck", "NTA-She\u2019s having parties for herself and pretending she\u2019s mom of the year by acting like they\u2019re for you.

I don't blame you for finally snapping.  \n\nA dirty old coffeemarker for a birthday gift? Shoes you can't possibly wear? Come *on*. Looks to me like she has intense subconscious resentment toward you -- unless she does the same thing to others?\n\nI hope you can celebrate next year's birthday with people who want you to have a lovely time.\n\nAnd a suggestion: if you still have the coffeemaker, regift it to her on her birthday.", "NTA. Sorry that your mother makes everything about her.", "NTA. absolute narcissist", "NTA - she's selfish", "NTA.  She is totally trying to play the victim.  Just curious, do you live at home?

Go find your real family.", "NTA If your mum doesn\u2019t wish to be embarrassed by her behaviour, she should behave differently. Let me guess, the shoes are her size? Ask for the receipt so you can exchange them. When she says that she will keep them and buy you different shoes later\u2026 tell her that you prefer to choose your own shoes so you will take care of it.", "I was raised by a malignant narcissist mom. Cutting off contact with her and the rest of my toxic family is the best thing I've ever done.", "NTA She kept pushing and pushing and you finally pushed back. I see nothing wrong with that. Especially as she tried to make you eat a cake you don\u2019t like after opening presents you physically can\u2019t use and she knows that. People have limits to how much they can just smile and wave in situations like that. After years of her using your birthday as an excuse to do what she wants, she should be embarrassed for using you as an excuse to feed her own ego (through parties for her).", "Thank you. I do live alone, but there's a lot of pressure from family to stay close and spend a lot of time together and I'll get pestered relentlessly if I don't. I can't afford college though because my mom won't give her income for the fafsa :(", "I've wanted to do my own thing for a while now but that includes me going out with friends and she gets mad about me \"choosing friends over family\" and keeps yelling that I \"better be at the party at her house\" and it stresses me out so much I just go :(", ">NTA. I started out firmly thinking the opposite, but after reading the whole thing\n\nOmg, I thought the same thing. The title really puts the OP in a much worse light than she deserves \ud83d\ude2d", "Nta-  I would try to explain to your family all the bs on why you snapped but I have a feeling your family wouldn\u2019t care and take the approach of respecting your elders and forgiving family to keep the peace. \nI\u2019m pretty vengeful so if I were you on her birthday I would totally do everything opposite of what she likes \nExample: she likes chocolate  cake , oops vanilla cake \nShe likes Starbucks darn I got you Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and play it off as trying my best to make her happy.", "I'm pretty certain she doesn't like me. I've always kind of been the left out one, when they go out to eat I'm not taken along, when they'd bring home food when I lived there they wouldn't bring enough for me to have any, im the only one who was expected to do everything around the house while my brothers could do whatever they wanted, my brothers always get spoiled on their birthdays and Christmas, like new phones, computers, consoles, games, etc. I'm guessing it's because she doesn't like being reminded of my father? Idk I'm the only kid she didn't have with her boyfriend so that's my best guess. Shoot when I was moving out they threw away all my collectibles and stuff before I even got a chance to grab them.", "No I don't live at home, I recently moved out but there's still a lot of family pressure to spend time with her because \"she's my mother and it's wrong to distance from her since she's all I have.\"", "Oh I\u2019m so sorry to hear this. This is such abusive behaviour. Is there someone from a local college that you can talk to?

Sounds like you could use that for your own well-being and it'd cheer you up after dealing with this!", "Are you over 18? If so, you do not need her permission. You do not owe her an explanation. And the choosing friends over family line, mirror much? Let her know that her friends are not your family, and your room is not a fun place to celebrate your bday. She\u2019s a big girl. She\u2019ll get over it. Or not. That\u2019s her choice. It\u2019s not on you. Her feelings and her choices are her problem. Not yours.", "That is *awful*. I'm so sorry for what you've had to endure. From what you've written, she sounds abusive, cruel and malicious.\n\nYou may be right that you remind her of your father, but that's a rotten way to treat an innocent child. You've done nothing to deserve this.\n\nHave you thought about therapy for yourself? It might help you feel better and give you ways to deal with her, whether it's going LC or NC, or confronting her in some way.\n\nI wish you all the best -- and many happy birthdays.", "well it sounds like your bday is the biggest problem unless she is constantly doing this stuff to you.  At least stop celebrating your bday with her.", "Sounds like you don\u2019t even have her since she doesn\u2019t care about your wants/needs. I think you might want to create space. If you had a mom, I\u2019d agree that you don\u2019t want to lose that, but sounds like she\u2019s not all that interested in being your mom but rather treating you like some kind of burden who owes her something.", "And depending on how old you are, you might not need her information. Talk to a financial aid officer at one of  the schools you are interested and see what can be done.", "Unfortunately all of us work weekends but I'm hoping we can plan a day soon to try and go out.", "Yeah one year me and my best friend planned a whole day but when they asked what I was doing for my bday they freaked out and said i better not and I got nonstop calls and texts about how I better get to that house on the day of because they're all waiting for me and I better not ruin the day for everyone I was anxious and crying the whole time from it so my friend just dropped me off there instead"]}
