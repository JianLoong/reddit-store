But my job will sometimes only have me working 3 or 4 days of the week so it evens out in the end. The issue is not there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy job is laborious and has a strict no phone policy. We lock them in lockers during the shifts. It's not because I have one of those bosses that doesn't want us to carry our phones. It's just not the kind of job you can have anything but what you need on you. I am in a work jumpsuit, face covered, and doing manual labor. The pay is great but it is an all hands on deck at all times kind of job. If there is an emergency someone can call the job and  then someone will come tell me to pick up the phone Which has happened in the past. IE birth of a children, medical emergency, family emergency etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife is annoyed that I am pretty much unavailable from when I clock in to when I clock out. I have an hour break but that is mostly spent eating and I'll reply to any inquiries during that time. But in general for 10-12 hours(sometimes it can be 15 hours) minus the hour break and another fifteen, I am not reachable. It will be minor things like asking what I would like to eat or a question about plans. Or sometimes it might be serious as we her mother is not doing well with health.

After work and when I am off and she is working, we text a lot and it's fun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA recent situation she had to leave work to see her mother and updated me on her status.

If you're doing underwater welding of course you aren't ta for not having your phone. If you're painting cars then yeah you're slightly ah ish when you don't have your phone on you when you know there are family medical issues, birth of children, etc going on. So likely NAH but you need to check the phone more often and unless its a hazard it makes sense to keep it on you when you know there are ongoing family medical issues. As for your comparison, doctors generally have phones on them when they're not elbows deep in someone; they may be in surgery for a few hours inconsistently, but it's not a never reachable by cell situation. Also, side note if you put in 10-15 hours daily there's no possible way that childcare and home maintenance are evenly split. I seriously doubt you do every single thing when you get home and on weekends.
