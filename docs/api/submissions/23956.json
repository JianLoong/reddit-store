But my job will sometimes only have me working 3 or 4 days of the week so it evens out in the end. The issue is not there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy job is laborious and has a strict no phone policy. We lock them in lockers during the shifts. It's not because I have one of those bosses that doesn't want us to carry our phones. It's just not the kind of job you can have anything but what you need on you. I am in a work jumpsuit, face covered, and doing manual labor. The pay is great but it is an all hands on deck at all times kind of job.

As someone who also has a different work schedule from my spouse, a family to care for, and two aging parents/grandparents between us, I'm willing to bet that your wife just feels she doesn't get enough time with you. If you aren't already, I think you should try giving her a 15 min call on your lunch breaks.

If you're doing underwater welding of course you aren't ta for not having your phone. If you're painting cars then yeah you're slightly ah ish when you don't have your phone on you when you know there are family medical issues, birth of children, etc going on. So likely NAH but you need to check the phone more often and unless its a hazard it makes sense to keep it on you when you know there are ongoing family medical issues. As for your comparison, doctors generally have phones on them when they're not elbows deep in someone; they may be in surgery for a few hours inconsistently, but it's not a never reachable by cell situation. Also, side note if you put in 10-15 hours daily there's no possible way that childcare and home maintenance are evenly split. I seriously doubt you do every single thing when you get home and on weekends. Plus if yiur kids are young they're likely in bed when you get home if you work 15 hours a day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not \"what do you want to eat this weekend?\" but \"OMG your dad is being put in an ambulance right now.\"  I remember that if someone called me at work, a rush of adrenaline would squirt down my spine as soon as I heard their voice on the phone because you knew it would never be good news. \n\nEven now, when we both work from home together 3 days each week, we hardly speak to each other during the work day.

I cannot think of any boss that would not be annoyed by an employee who is constantly being bothered by family phone calls. This makes the employee look very bad.
