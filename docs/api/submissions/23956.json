Oh yeah we planned better, dealt with things ourselves, or called the office in an emergency.  Your wife is being unreasonable.  Put the phone down.", "NTA\n\nYou are not required to be at her beck and call 24/7. We live in an age where people have a hard time grasping the fact that you don't have to be reachable immediately. \n\nShe needs to chill.", "NTA\n\nAs you describe it, your lack of access to a phone is completely reasonable.  And as there's an emergency policy, that reinforces your assertions in the post.  Your wife is being unreasonable and she'll just have to get over it.", "NTA. Your job sounds very demanding and you have a valid reason for not being able to use your phone during your shifts. Your wife should respect that and not expect you to reply to every message she sends. You have a system in place for emergencies and you communicate with her when you can. She needs to be more understanding and supportive of your work.", "NTA - my hubby and I have 'normal' jobs, but still leave each other alone during work hours....because we're working. Maybe she is just lonely and bored.  No right to be mad at you at all.  She should dig into the feeling for sure. Good luck!", "NTA your wife needs to grow up and stop this", "NTA she sounds a little childish. Maybe invite her in to where you work, and show it her. How you suit up, where you leave your phone and the type of work you do. If she still doesn\u2019t get it, call her out every time she\u2019s passive aggressive about it. Ask her if you should quit your job so you can be available for her to text her back. It sounds like she either has some anxiety or she wants to be controlling.", "NTA, and she\u2019s being quite immature imo. She has the ability to reach you in an emergency and that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed. Cell phones, while helpful, have made people believe that should be able to reach anyone at anytime. That\u2019s a ridiculous expectation that\u2019s even more ridiculous when said person is at work.", "NTA work is work. Not everyone can have their phone on them and be available 24/7 especially if it is NOT an emergency. Like what on earth did people do before cell phones? Your at work, you do not need to be available for trivial things during this, she needs to get the heck over it, she's being absolutely ridiculous and thus is coming from a woman who can admit to being generally cliny with her own husband.", "Nta someone else just had the same post and he got written up for his phone going off during work. It was in his locker on do not disturb but the wife called so much it kicked dnd off", "Work time is work time ..there are plenty of breaks that she can talk to him and after work.   My job is same way no phones except on break.", "NTA. I mean she can be annoyed at the situation but I don\u2019t see the point in being annoyed with you since this is a rule for your job. I mean, is it important enough to her that she\u2019d want you to look for new employment and all the hassle that goes with that? I think that would be overreaction but it\u2019s something you could consider as a family. But really that\u2019s the only option I see if she wants things to be different", "NTA. Sorry your wife appears to be dumb??", "NTA. I think that it\u2019s totally reasonable to not have your phone/not answering your phone on the job. Your wife is being kinda unreasonable expecting you to respond while you\u2019re working with your type of job. I would suggest maybe trying to explain the situation to her, if that doesn\u2019t work maybe just try to set that boundaries with her.", "NTA. She sounds ridiculous, you\u2019re at work therefore you\u2019re working!", "NTA\n\nUnless it\u2019s an emergency, I don\u2019t understand why this should be a problem. Work hours are for work (sadly).", "NTA \n\nShe needs to get the fuck over it. Why is she so clingy? She can\u2019t change the rules of your employment. A LOT of spouses go through this, she needs to grow the fuck up.", "My husband and I worked at the same college,  different departments.   We never contacted each other or visited each other's office during the work day unless it was an extreme family emergency.", "NTA", "I'm assuming you've explained the restrictions at your workplace.  Probably more than once.\n\nSo...is she not listening?  Not understanding?  Is she a few grapes short of a fruit salad?", "She acts like you\u2019re making the whole phone policy up.  Wives often do that kind of thing as if rules should apply to them", "Seems reasonable to me that you don\u2019t engage in chit chat during your worktime. I don\u2019t see why she should be angry about that.\n\nWorking 10-12-15 hrs daily seems a lot, though\u2026 Maybe she has more issues about your overall reachability and being present, rather than the fact that you don\u2019t text her while working. Just a thought.\n\nAnd just to check, you are also a contact for the kids\u2019 kindergarten? They\u2019re not calling her only in case of kids related issues?", "When you say that you'll reply to any inquiries at that time, se you saying you'll text her back or are you talking replying to other emails, etc.?\n\nI don't think you're an asshole, but it sounds like your wife is seeking connection with you. As someone who also has a different work schedule from my spouse, a family to care for, and two aging parents/grandparents between us, I'm willing to bet that your wife just feels she doesn't get enough time with you. If you aren't already, I think you should try giving her a 15 min call on your lunch breaks. And maybe agree between you that lunch/dinner will be figured out before work.", "NAH depending on what you're doing for work. If you're doing underwater welding of course you aren't ta for not having your phone. If you're painting cars then yeah you're slightly ah ish when you don't have your phone on you when you know there are family medical issues, birth of children, etc going on. So likely NAH but you need to check the phone more often and unless its a hazard it makes sense to keep it on you when you know there are ongoing family medical issues. As for your comparison, doctors generally have phones on them when they're not elbows deep in someone; they may be in surgery for a few hours inconsistently, but it's not a never reachable by cell situation. Also, side note if you put in 10-15 hours daily there's no possible way that childcare and home maintenance are evenly split. I seriously doubt you do every single thing when you get home and on weekends. Plus if yiur kids are young they're likely in bed when you get home if you work 15 hours a day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But, in this situation, it seems like the issues are a result of your wife's mother nearing the end of her life. This is natural, of course, but is still probably emotional for your wife. \n\nI suggest asking her how you can support her at this time. Bring this conversation up at a time where you're not in conflict and if you're genuine, I suspect your wife will not only open up but be grateful for having a safe space in which to do so. \n\nAnd in case you were unaware, YOU are your wife's safe space.", "NTA\n\nYour job has this requirement.\n\nHer rationale is childish. And whatever did people do before cellphones?", "NTA your wife's instant gratification for immediate responses in texts is not your responsibility. If it's important she can call. If it's not, seriously asking about dinner every day? Then it can wait. This is a lame reason to be mad at you.", "How are you supposed to respond to a text when you literally are NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE YOUR PHONE?\n\nINFO:  Is your wife really that thick?

I know people like this. They literally cannot wrap their heads around the fact that not everyone can stop what they're doing and send a text, or pick up the phone, throughout their workday. Ask her point blank to choose - you answer her texts/calls and be unemployed, or she understands that you will respond as soon as you can.

The conditions of the job are what they are. OP can't change them, other than taking a different job.\n\nAssuming this has been explained to wife in extremely clear terms, and she's still upset about it - where do you go from there?\n\nIt's like having a spouse who is unhappy with you because the sky is blue.

It sucks, but that's the way it is in some jobs. Also, working 12 to 15 hours a day isn't really that much if he normally only works three to four days a week. That's still the same amount of hours as many parents put in weekly.", "Often I am working 3-4 days a week only.
