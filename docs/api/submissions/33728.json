This person is clearly focusing his time and interest somewhere else, or on someone else.  \n\nI have to wonder if you are actually his girlfriend or if he\u2019s also in another relationship. \n\nThe \u201cco-worker\u201d might be another woman, someone he\u2019s trying to get into a relationship with, and will break up with you when he does, or he is married and you don\u2019t know about it. \n\nEither way, find someone who prioritizes YOU.", "NTA is his coworker female?", "NTA. It sounds like there is unequal effort put into this relationship. \nIs there tension between him and your family? It's weird to rather be with a coworker's family than your girlfriend on Christmas", "It sounds more like you're a convenience than a girlfriend", "NTA\n\nIf during the entire week preceding the holidays he did not find one evening for you, but spent all this time either at work or with people from work and decided to spend the christmas practically in the same way it is his choice and his priorities are clear. It's unbelievable that he expected you to enjoy it. I think this relationship doesn't make much sense. You will find someone for whom you are important enough to spend such an important celebration with you.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s just not that into you.", "INFO: How long have you two been dating and has he met your family before/how well does he know them?", "Girl break up with him. Does he even like you? NTA", " I would have already dumped this man. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHe is not interested in the relationship and I'm wondering if he may be cheating on you based on all the red flags I see in this post", "NTA OP he spent Christmas with another woman. I\u2019m sorry. Even if these pics are legit and he is with his friends\u2026 a committed boyfriend would want to spend Christmas with you, meet the family and attempt to impress them.\n\nYour boyfriend is telling you that he is here for a good time - not a long time. He sees you as a casual bit of fun. Meeting the fam would give everyone the wrong impression that is he serious about you.", "NTA. He has no consideration for you whatsoever. He does not sound very invested in this relationship, to be honest. If you are not getting what you need from him, you are best to find someone who does consider your feelings.", "NTA. Getting the feeling OP is the other woman.\n\nThat or he's trying to see how much bs he can get away with in this relationship. Either way he doesn't value OP at all.", "NTA \n\nHe's looking for a reason to make you break up with him.\n\nLet him go.", "If I were you, I would decide this person isn't worthy of my time, given how unwanted he makes me feel. You are NTA for being upset over canceled plans, especially at the holidays, but I don't think continuing to put yourself in this situation with him is good for you.", "NTA - Why are you in a relationship with someone who doesn't even want to spend any time with you? How he feels about you is pretty obvious.", "NTA-\nYou need to prioritize yourself, because he won't.\nLeave, gurl. Run for the hills like an angry bull is chasing you.", "When you make it clear you're easily bought off, his plans will always trump yours and his recourse is to buy your love again.\n\n\"He promised to take me to get my nails done after he treated me like a piece of shit and I was OK with that.\"\n\nTransactional love is not love. Get yourself some perspective and a new partner.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but your bf and his side chick are", "NTA. Your boyfriend's co-worker is more important to him than you. The real question is what will you do next? This doesn't sound like a healthy relationship for you.", "Did you ever read that book \"He's Just Not That Into You\"?", "NTA- I had a friend who would make plans with me after I'd invite with them to stuff.\n\nThen I would literally see them looking around for something else to do.\n\nKind of feels like he's treating you like that", "NTA, but telling him he ruined your Christmas is the least of your problems. If this guy prioritizes time with a random coworker\u2019s family over you, he just told you he doesn\u2019t care about you at all. More likely, he\u2019s in a relationship with the coworker. Either way, have some self-respect and dump this guy. You think he\u2019s your boyfriend and care about spending time with him. He obviously doesn\u2019t care about spending time with you and doesn\u2019t see you as his girlfriend. Get rid of him now.", "NTA\n\nLeave him, he doesn't really care about you. You're wasting your time staying with him.", "I wonder how long they\u2019ve been together. She doesn\u2019t mention last Christmas so probably less than a year. There\u2019s a good chance he\u2019s never met her family and wasn\u2019t up to meeting them for the first time over Christmas", "And even if there is no other relationship, he clearly doesn't want to really be with OP. NTA but you should really start to think about kicking him to the curb.", "Get a little self respect", "Even so, if what she describes is accurate, he consistently made plans with other people instead of with her.  Not visiting her family is understandable, but not visiting *her* so he can hang out all week with his co-workers, is a clear sign she is not a priority - and she should look for a relationship where she IS a priority.", "Not to mention that he made plans with other people AFTER he made plans with OP and just blew her off. Being in a relationship with someone who only wants to be with you if he has nothing better to do is not a good relationship to be in.", "NTA, but he's sent you a message on how important you are to him, listen to it.  He didn't want to come to your family's Christmas but he was ok with going to someone else's family.  He made plans with you and then got what he considered a better offer.  You're not making him feel guilty because he'd only feel guilty if he cared about you.  Like I said, he's sending you a message.  Listen.", "NTA. I\u2019d take this as a sign to breakup. He clearly doesn\u2019t value you or your time. You deserve better OP", "NTA.  That's not a boyfriend.", "Break up \n\nBreak up \n\nBreak up \n\nShould have told him if he left, you\u2019re breaking up \n\nNTA", "NTA - do yourself a favor and forgo his company from New Year's and on as well.", "Nta\n\nWhy do you want to be with someone who doesnt want to be with you. You\u2019re confusing to me.", "Get rid of him, he is not invested in this relationship!", "NTA\n\nYour BF has shown where his priorities are.\n\nYou cried because you felt unwanted.\n\nThings sound very unequal here in terms of who is giving what.  Please consider that you deserve a lot more than he seems willing to give you.", "NTA, this guy doesn\u2019t take you out your relationship seriously and isn\u2019t going to. Either accept that this is a fwb and not an actual boyfriend, or find someone who will  treat you better", "He sounds like a real winner.\n\n\"...I feel like a second choice...\"\n\nI'm not even sure about second. Maybe third or fourth.\n\nI do hope you are rethinking wasting any more time with this guy.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but I think he's ready to break up and too cowardly to do it himself, so he's forcing you to do it by being awful toward you.", "Well said.", "OP, he's just not that into you. Either he's already got someone else and you are the side piece, or he's working on getting someone else, which appears to be his main priority."]}
