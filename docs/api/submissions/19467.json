Two, it can also be seen as beneficial to *her* as rather than it being OP's desire to decompress, it can be her receiving more attentiveness from OP if they are instead speaking in person.", "You have to be careful with that logic (agree with you) People/studies have said anything affects your driving be it music, books, phone or other people in the car.", "NTA - however, the answer isn\u2019t to turn the phone off.

I would sit her down and explain:\n\n\u201chey, when I\u2019m driving home I like to have that alone time to be with my thoughts or my audiobook or podcast to decompress. It is important to me and makes me feel good. I love that you are so excited to share your day with me. I love hearing about it. How about we make a compromise and as soon as I get home and you give me 10 minutes to change and sit my stuff down, we sit down and you can tell me all about it. Or we can make dinner together while you tell me.

I think this warrants a discussion outside of a commute scenario. Like assuring her it's not about you not wanting to talk to her, but those commute times are effectively your down time. \n\nSometimes I find my partner and I are on different wavelengths when we want to bond and when we want to be alone.

At first, I was calling my husband every night. He told me a couple of times that nothing has changed since yesterday. I realized that it was OK to go some time without talking.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rude or selfish at all to state lovingly to her you like your alone time in the car and are completely available to her as soon as you get home.

So the calls will drop every time you go through one.  Haha, just kidding.", "Nah. I had a similar conversation with my wife. The thing is, talking on the phone is taxing. It's way more distracting than just listening to something. Even if the traffic isn't hectic, it really takes something out of you to drive while on the phone the entire time. I stressed the safety and the emotional and physical drain, which seemed to help her understand why I don't want to stay on the phone the entire drive.", "Your problem is simple. Tell her it's not safe to talk to her on the phone while driving. There are actual laws you need to comply with.", "NTA  tell her that your drive home is when you decompress and get rid of the stress of the day, which makes you a better partner and listener when you get home.  \n\nI listen to audiobooks and find them very calming and enough of a distraction that I feel relaxed.", "I also have a long commute, but I'm usually the one that wants to call my partner (at least when I'm not in my 35 minute deadzone) so I understand both sides of the coin.\n\nBefore saying anything to your wife, ask your wife if the two of you can take the love language test together: https://5lovelanguages.com/quizzes/love-language\n\nI'm sure quality time is going to score very highly for her. Her calling is her saying she missed you and she loves you and she's expressing her love, which feels great! So yeah, she might feel that you're basically saying \"thanks for the love, bye,\" even though it isn't. But taking the test will be a nice way to open the dialogue because maybe your love language ISN'T quality time, or at least not as highly as hers is. So together you can come up with ways to make sure that you're both expressing and receiving love in a healthy and productive way. Maybe you work out she can call you once or twice a week? And express that your commute is your way to decompress from work to home and love, and you want to be able to give her your love in a way that's beneficial to you both.", "NTA\n\nMaybe if you explain the drive with your audiobook and music are your way of winding down so when you get home you can be fully present for her. It's decompression time that allows you to arrive home relaxed and be a better partner/parent/companion. That might make sense to her.", "Nta. I, too, have a long commute.

Also say u like listening to ur audiobooks/pods/music while u come home and her calls interrupt that(b sure not to sound mean and speak gently).

You\u2019re on your way home and there is absolutely no reason why she needs to talk to you while you\u2019re going there. It\u2019s controlling of her to want your attention 24/7 and you need to talk to her about it before this ruins your marriage. \n\nSuccessful relationships succeed by respecting each others boundaries. Your boundary is, \u201cI prefer my alone time on the way home.\u201d If you can\u2019t express your feelings to your wife how is it a successful marriage?

If you came here first instead of telling your wife then you are the problem.", "I'd ask her if she would rather you listen actively and intently to what she's saying or drive safely.", "NTA. And I understand your frustration, each of us needs some me-time to decompress.\n\nWhy don't you just tell her that you need this commute time to decompress but will be there for her once you come home (and then really do it?)", "NTA. \n\nTaking while driving is distracted driving. It increases your risk of accident. I rarely talk to passengers when driving for that same reason.\n\nPut your phone in driving mode, her cAlls won\u2019t come through.

So we've decided he will call and if at that moment I can talk I'd love to chat with him. If not I let him know and he instead listens to audiobook or music. No big. \nMaybe compromise.  You call her when you are first getting in the car and you guys will catch up quick for 15 mins. And then you'd like the rest of the time to decompress.   Or even try  loving text saying you will be home and can't wait to see her and hear from her. \nBut make sure once you are home she feels paid attention to when talking about her say for a bit.", "NTA. My spouse is the same, just calls to talk and ramble. Where as my drive home is my quiet time between work and home. If he gets offended I don\u2019t take it personally as I\u2019ve explained it before, my drive time (even when running errands, etc) is my quiet time and we\u2019ll talk when I get home. If he wants to call and ramble because he\u2019s the opposite, he can chat with friends or family.

A classic case of people who just show and recieve love in different ways and experience hurt different ways.

Then put your phone on Do Not Disturb and enjoy.", "My go to would be to just not answer.", "I mean, the adult thing to do would still to have a conversation about it, which it sounds like OP hasn't attempted.\n\nThat said I imagine this habit of hers would've been obvious even before they married and should've been dealt with then, imo.

Similarly, actively participating in a conversation is orders of magnitude more distracting than listening to music or a podcast.", "Exactly. Maybe this is the wife\u2019s way of decompressing, just like the husband wants to listen to pod cast on the way home. Women want to be listened to, not solutioned for, maybe the wife won\u2019t talk to the husband  face to face and it\u2019s her way of decompressing for the day using a phone.
