It gives a person relief for the day.

Everyone needs time to decompress after work and it\u2019s great you can do that on your drive home, and then spend the rest of your time with her.\n\nMy husband drives and operates a concrete pump and has a headset to do phone calls when he drives - sometimes it\u2019s with me because our kids are having a crazy week, but a lot of times it\u2019s when he calls his friends and catches up.

It\u2019s his time mostly uninterrupted to keep up with his friends, and I think that\u2019s great.

I used my commutes to either get my thoughts together in the way to work, catch up with friends I didn\u2019t get to see often, or decompress before I got home so I could give my husband and family my attention.

Be honest with her, while also being kind about it. Everyone needs some alone time; it's not personal against her for you to need some time alone with your thoughts.

So can you commit to finding a time during the day to talk to your wife without any distractions?", "ESH you are married. Use your words. Yeesh!", "I abhor talking on the phone.  Hate. It. My husband however, feels that the driving time is the ultimate time to have a conversation.\n\n I listen to audiobooks when I'm driving too and he feels that's a great time to talk with me also. I find out what he needs, any more stops I need to make before I get home, and remind him that talking distracts me and I was listening to a book.  It's hard sometimes because I know that *he* enjoys it. I just can't though because it adds exponentially to my anxiety.", "NTA when I get rattling on, my husband says \u201coh cool! There\u2019s a Quik Trip! I gotta pee.

You need to have an actual conversation with her about this.\n\nI know you mentioned you don\u2019t want to hurt her feelings but regardless of how you handle this, it\u2019s gonna hurt her feelings a little bit. That\u2019s totally okay. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in the wrong, it just means you\u2019re telling her something she doesn\u2019t want to hear. Relationships are built on that kind of stuff. Make sure to reassure her during the conversation and let her know that you can\u2019t wait to see her and talk to her as soon as you get home :)", "NTA. Being in a relationship with someone does not give them free reign over every moment of quiet time you have. If I were only dating someone like this, it'd be a dealbreaker. It's*good* to occasionally miss your partner.", "Tell her it\u2019s making you nervous, about having an accident and being distracted.", "NTA. Tell her that you feel like this distracts you and is unsafe. That is a truth, because talking on the phone while driving IS distracting, even though that is not the reason you don't want to be on the phone heading home.", "NTA. I too need my downtime/alone time during my commute for thinking or music or podcasts. Thankfully my partner is the same. Having time for yourself is essential for balance and the health of your relationship. It may feel uncomfortable to address this with her, but just let her know. You love her and want to spend time with her but in order to be the best version of yourself *for* her, you need your me time to reset before you get home.", "YTA this is a repost", "I have the exact same problem. I'm not a big talker on the phone at the best of times and my commute is generally the only time in my day I have even vaguely to myself, listening to my wife complain about her day and say, \"uuuuummmmm\" 400 times isn't very relaxing", "My situation is the exact same, but opposite lol. He wants to call me every day, every commute home. But he's coming HERE - I'd rather him listen to an audio book and talk to me when he gets home. He gets hurt feelings when I don't want to talk, and it's frustrating for sure.", "NTA... I have the opposite problem, my husband calls me on his way home to keep him company. (20 min)\n\nI try, but I last only so long. Each of us try to understand the needs of the other. \n\nJust let her know that this is your decompression time.", "Related to (1), personally I'd instead mention that I prefer not to speak on the phone while driving, and only in short amounts when necessary. \n\nIt's doubly helpful since for one, it is beneficial to OP's safety since listening, understanding, and responding in a conversation takes far more attention than simply listening to a podcast. Two, it can also be seen as beneficial to *her* as rather than it being OP's desire to decompress, it can be her receiving more attentiveness from OP if they are instead speaking in person.", "You have to be careful with that logic (agree with you) People/studies have said anything affects your driving be it music, books, phone or other people in the car.", "NTA - however, the answer isn\u2019t to turn the phone off. Have an honest conversation with your wife. \n\nLet her know that your commute is your time to unwind and you like to catch up on podcast and books during that time. Plus, I could be taking a leap here but.. when you have that time to unwind do you feel you\u2019re more present with your wife and more relaxed?\n\nMy partner is an introvert and I\u2019m a semi extrovert. I know he needs time alone to recharge. I don\u2019t take it as a \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love me\u201d.

You can\u2019t manage her emotions or how she reacts when you express what you need. She might be upset, which isn\u2019t fair to you, but you should still talk to her about it. \n\nIf she can\u2019t find a way to respect that you want to decompress and listen to something on your commute, which is completely reasonable, that\u2019s kind of a huge problem for your relationship.

I have my phone on DND when driving so only emergencies can get through , just do that.\n\nCommunicate you are doing that of course but do it anyway.

I wouldn't pursue the option of telling her this is your special wind-down time, that's only telling her she's lower priority than an audiobook or radio broadcast. I'd take the option to explain that it's a safety hazard to have telephone calls in a moving vehicle, and that she'll have all your time when you arrive home safely. Then make sure you live up to your promise!\n\nNAH", "NAH But you do need to tell her that you\u2019d rather talk when you get home so you can listen to your shit in the car, since I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t listen to your shit at home.", "Does she work? Years ago, I had a supervisor whose wife didn't work, and she'd pounce on him as soon as he walked in the door.

It\u2019s okay for you to need your me time, and it\u2019s also okay for her to be unhappy about this. She is an adult and it is not your job to manage her feelings. It would be nice for you to make an effort to connect with her at home though.", "NAH. You both have a right to your preferences but if your wife is feeling lonely (and I would bet solid money she is), you guys need to brainstorm solutions that work for both of you. Does your wife have anyone else she can call? Is she a SAH-spouse? Because that can take a hell of a toll.", "You\u2019re not an asshole but it\u2019s cute your wife wants to talk to you so much. Maybe you can work out a compromise?", "Why not just have a conversation with her about it?", "NTA put your phone on DND", "NTA. I'm the same way, I don't need to hear about your day when you're just going to tell me about it anyway, or it's just a call to vent about things and then the calls over.. I prefer listening to music so I can relax from work", "NTA,  I know that I get in the mode of business phone calls, \"Just the facts ma'am.\"", "Just explain to her that you like to have your commune home to ease the transition from work to home, its your me-time, and that you prefer to catch up and share stories from the day face to face.", "3) Tell her you want to fully focus on her day and can\u2019t do that properly while driving. \n\nAgree with NTA", ">  I\u2019m sure if you explain to her that it\u2019s your audiobook/alone time she\u2019ll understand. \n\nYeah good luck with that lol. Partners who are so clingy they need to be on the phone all the time even during your drives despite living together aren't going to take it well.", "Certainly for that length of time!", "Yep. NTA.", "Ew", "What?", "Anything can, but especially language processing. Listening to music can be a very different experience while driving depending on whether you're engaging with the lyrics or not, as language processing uses the same part of your brain as spatial processing iirc", "I second this advice.  OP, I would explain to your wife that the quiet time in the car without phone calls is important for you to decompress and come home being fully present with her.  Does she stay home during the day?  If so, it may be that she needs to talk to you and some kind of compromise needs to be worked out.", "Then how does he listen to his audiobook or podcast without a phone?", "Showing my age, I was thinking book on CD. LOL then he'll just have to send it all to voicemail."]}
