This has never been a problem for me, as I don't mind how she dresses, but lately I've been feeling exclusively attracted to masculine women I see on tiktok and social media. So I've brought this up with my gf and asked her if it would be possible for her to dress in a more masculine way from time to time, she looked unsure but said she would try but that she didn't have any clothes other than super feminine ones, so it would have to wait until she could buy masculine clothes since it wasn't at the top of her list currently (she's saving up to buy an expensive handmade dress and tailored suit she wants). \n\nSo this week comes around, and her and I as well as a bunch of friends were participating in a gift exchange as it's a tradition we do in January to honor a friend that passed away. I drew her name as the person I'd have to buy a gift for, and decided that I would buy her masculine clothes to wear, that way she wouldn't have to spend any of her own money on them.  I got her a lot of things that look amazing and that she's look hot in. Come the day of the gift exchange, she opens the gift and just smiles awkwardly and thanks me and then moves on, and our friends were acting confused asking if I was sure the gift was for her and not somebody else. After our friends left, she told me that she didn't appreciate the gift, and that she thought it was selfish because I was \"essentially gifting myself what I wanted\". I disagreed since I just didn't want her to spend her own money, especially since she basically implied that getting masculine clothes was at the bottom of her list. She then asked how I choose the clothes I wanted to gift her, and I told her I was inspired by hot masc and butch women on tiktok and what they were wearing, and got her the things I liked most on them so she could recreate the look. She got even more upset by that and told me she didn't have the energy or words to argue over this with me since she has a court case she has to focus on, but that we would talk after. \n\nIt's been a day now and we still haven't talked, and I honestly don't really get why this is such a big deal. I spoke to my sister and she is on my side, but some of our friends aren't. Gf and I are supposed to have a big talk today, and I'd like to get reddit's perspective before we talk. So AITA ?

This implies that you find her somewhat less attractive than you do them. So in order to \"fix\" what you perceive to be wrong here, you went out and bought her clothes that were the opposite of her personal taste and style. You then presented her with the clothes she neither wanted or asked for and called them a \"gift\". A gift for her to look more like the women you find hot. \n\nThereby simultaneously giving yourself a gift and insulting your gf", "YTA - It\u2019s similar to gifting sexy underwear.  The gift was for your pleasure, not hers.\n\nAnd your behavior indicates you are not attracted to her anymore and want her to change for you.", "YTA. The gift may have been technically for her, but in reality it was for you. YOU want her to dress different than her normal style. She was open to doing it for you, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s too thrilled by the idea. The fact that you used a gift exchange involving other people as the time to give her this gift (which, again, is really for YOU) was inappropriate. She probably felt disappointed and a bit embarrassed.", "YTA \nYou gave her a present that you wanted, not that she wanted", "If my partner gave me stuff he wanted me to wear because it gives him a boner, and I had to open those gifts in public I\u2019d be pretty pissed off.", "YTA- Mate, you can't expect someone who loves being femme to go more masc, and they had made it clear to you, that they aren't into it. \n\nyou guys need to talk it out.\n\nJust from my perspective I like being andro, and slightly femme, if I was with someone who wanted me to be more masc that'd make me really uncomfortable.", "YTA. You bought yourself a gift and made your gf feel like you're not attracted to her. Congrats!", "YTA.  From what you described, she looked \"unsure\" when you mentioned the clothes.  This tells me she wasn't on board.  Then in the gift exchange you didn't think thoughtfully of what she would want. You got her something YOU want.  That isn't really a gift, it's a nudge that you want her to change. You got her a \"gift\" that only you benefit from.", "YTA - you bought yourself a gift. If you want her to dress a certain way on occasion, you buy that extra. That'll be your gift.", "YTA. So you're trying to force a different gender expression on your gf? Just break up and go date a masc woman. This is awful. I feel really bad for your poor gf, she must feel like shit over this. Probably completely unattractive to the person she loves. She'll hopefully leave you soon. Poor thing.", "YTA I\u2019m a lesbian and girl you fucked up. She clearly doesn\u2019t want to and is too kind to say no. Even if she wanted to wear masculine clothes from time to time, then she would want to wear the masc clothes *she* wants to wear, not the ones you want her to wear. If you aren\u2019t attracted to femme women anymore, break up with her and start dating a masc woman. You basically told her you don\u2019t find her attractive the way she is. Bonus: you did it in front of all of your mutual friends, to the point even they recognized she was uncomfortable and questioned if this was something she wanted. Extra sprinkle of humiliation.\n\nYou acted extra selfishly. You better be begging for forgiveness by the time she gets home.", "Ha ha ha wow! YTA you have just told your gf that you are not attracted to her the way she is. You are now trying to make her into something she isn't for your own selfish wants. This isn't a fetish where you ask your partner to wear a certain outfit for role playing, you have literally asked her to change her wardrobe. She is right too you gave her a gift for you because you are the one who wants her to change. If you are no longer attracted to her how she is then maybe that's a sign that the relationship is no longer good for you. Certainly for her", "Yta. This is the equivalent of a man giving lingerie a woman has stated she doesnt want to wear.", "YTA\n\nI say this as a non-binary person who has been pressured to dress more feminine and more masculine by many different partners over the years. It's so shitty. It's so degrading to have someone who's supposed to care about you try to change your appearance and try to shove you into a box that fits their preferences. If you were to flip this and she was always butch and you gave her a dress and make-up in front of your friends, what kind of reaction would you expect from her and your friends? YTA big time.", "YTA you said it yourself you \"got her the things I liked most on them\" \n\nShe was uncomfortable with the idea of changing her style, but you persisted. This is something you told her that you wanted and she reluctantly said she would try at some point.\n\nYou disrespected both her comfort and the tradition of honoring your late friend. Giving a gift should be something the gift receiver is excited about, not something they were reluctant about.\n\nGo apologize and get her something she actually likes.", "YTA, you are trying to change her into something for you. The gift you bought her wasn't what she wanted. It was what you wanted. You bought a gift for yourself that you want her to wear so you can get off on it.\n\nYou know who she is. Stop trying to change her into something she doesn't want. She doesn't want to be your dress up Ken doll.", "C'mon, OP. You know YTA here.\n\n1.  You bought your girlfriend something you wanted her to wear because you'd find it attractive, despite knowing fully that **she isn't into wearing masculine attire.** And had the nerve to call that a \"gift\" to her.\n2. You stated bluntly that you bought those specific clothing items because they reminded you of things you've seen on masculine-presenting women on TikTok **and found those women attractive.**\n3. You took away her agency to buy clothing that was more masculine, but that she might be more comfortable in, again just to satisfy your own wants.\n4. You presented it to her in front of a group of y'all's friends, taking away her ability to respond in a fully honest manner.\n5. You discussed this situation **with someone who is not a member of your relationship.**\n\n**You're taking all of the power away from your girlfriend in every single step of this fuck-up.**", "YTA, your girlfriend was clearly not interested in changing her style but was trying to be diplomatic about it. You were effectively steamrolling her and trying to force her to change her style solely for you rather than considering what she might want. She's right, your present to her should have been something you knew she would like, not something you would like to see her in. You need to talk about your recent shift in attractions with her rather than trying to change her.", "Argh!! Two mistakes... 1) She was correct - what was supposed to be a gift for her was turned into a gift for you. The LEAST you can do when asking a partner to explore an interest of yours is pick up the tab- that's not an actual gift though. Appologize and tell her you'd like a do over and get her an actual thoughtful gift. And don't bill her for your choice of outfits. 2) Tell your girlfriend that you're way more turned on by the look of tiktok girls than her look? Guaranteed way to get single. This one you may not climb back from. She genuinely is who she is-  if that isn't what turns you on the least you can do is be kind and leave her with her dignity. YTA.", "There\u2019s no way you don\u2019t see it. Why are you playing dumb?", "YTA. You bought yourself a gift, not her. You should have bought her something SHE wanted, not something you wanted her to wear.", "YTA - you bought a gift for your girlfriend to turn her into something she\u2019s not, just because it\u2019s something that you like. If you really HAD to buy her masculine clothes, you probably shouldn\u2019t have gifted them to her on a day that is important to you, her and your friends, it just makes the \u201cgift\u201d even more inconsiderate.", "YTA. It\u2019s fine that you want her to try some masc clothes, and she agreed to it for your sake. But she also said it was low on her list. The end result of this gift was you enjoying looking at her in a style that is attractive for you. It\u2019s all about you. Gifts are supposed to be about the receiver.", "YTA. Is this for real? You tried to dress up your gf to fit your fantasy, she half-heartedly agrees, and you give her the things you like as a \"gift\" when she was barely lukewarm to the idea to begin with??? \n\nYou basically told her that to be \"hot\" to you, she has to totally alter something about her style or self-image and that she's not \"hot\" to you now.  \n\nA partnership isn't always about what you like. She said she'd save up and do it eventually, that meant, \"When I feel comfortable and secure enough in dressing a different way for you, I will.\" You took her, getting comfortable or softening to the idea away from her and thrust it onto her in front of all your friends. You tried to impose your will on her. \n\nI wouldn't talk to you either.", "YTA. Wow. It sounds like you\u2019re not attracted to your gf anymore and you\u2019re trying to turn her into someone you are attracted to. I would find this offensive as well.\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of hairstyles and clothing styles that my spouse hasn\u2019t loved. Now, I\u2019m willing to wear something I know he loves on special occasions like a date night but otherwise it\u2019s my body and I will choose how I am styled. Most of the time its not to his taste but he still loves me and finds me sexy.", "YTA - you bought something YOU want.\n\nNot something she wants for her.", "You're thinking about your happiness and what you want...not really worried about the message you're sending to your girlfriend. \n\nYTA.", "YTA and it sounds like you have a tiktok addiction. If my partner said \u201ci want you to dress like these hot anime babes i see on tiktok that i am exclusively attracted to\u201d \u201cI want you to dress like these hot \u2026cowgirl? babes im exclusively attracted to\u201d I would be super offended. Doesn\u2019t matter what genre of woman it is. It seems like you\u2019re consuming a LOT of content that feeds your superficiality and it would be good to take a break from tiktok or even break up with your femme partner since you say you\u2019re \u201cexclusively\u201d attracted to one specific look.", "Yta. Just for the selfish gift. Also it rubs me a really wrong way to ask somebody to change their style", "YTA she\u2019s not masc. go find another fucking girlfriend if that\u2019s what you want. \n\nActually, don\u2019t. You sound so selfish and entitled, I don\u2019t think you should be inflicted on anyone else.", "Tbh when I see throwaway account i automatically assumes YTA haha.\n\nAlthough after reading, I was correct. The main thing is you're trying to change her to become someone you like. Not to mention yes, you basically gifted yourself, not her. Literally everyone else read the room and got the same vibe except for you...", "YTA... so let's break it down\nYou like masculine look.\nYou give girlfriend present of masuline clothes because that what you want her to wear\n \n  So you can think she is hot\n\nNow what did girlfriend want...Noone knows because you never asked her", "Your the asshole. Stop lusting after other women!", "YTA for so many reasons: 1. You want your girlfriend to change to please you. 2. You bought a gift for your girlfriend that brought more pleasure to you than to her.", "As a masc woman, YTA dude. You have a girlfriend. Stop thirsting after strangers and pressuring your girlfriend to present in a way she\u2019s not comfortable with.", "YTA. \n\nYour taste in partners is allowed to change. You aren't allowed to force your wants on your partner because your obsessed with TikTok Mascs.", "YTA\n\nYou can\u2019t change someone\u2019s entire look because that changes their personality. After you talk maybe she would be willing to wear jeans and a nice button down white shirt. That could look very feminine depending on how you wear it. But if she likes wearing makeup and looking pretty, don\u2019t try to change that. I hate it when people want to change my personality for them. I\u2019m 58 so it\u2019s kinda too late to change who I am, which is just a regular person like anyone else.", "YTA you bought yourself a gift not her", "YTA. You gave her something you wanted, something that she could easily perceive as you trying to change who she is into into someone she is not.", "Yta - you DID gift her things for yourself. It's the lesbian equivalent of buying your housewife a French maid costume because you think it'll be hot & she mentioned she might be willing to roleplay then saying \"see! I saved you money by buying this thing that you didn't actually want! And I didn't have to find anything YOU actually like! I'm so smart!\"", "YTA.\n\nYou get your partner what they like, not what YOU  want. \n\nYou know that she didn't want to wear masculine clothes and that wasn't a priority for her. Don't buy people stuff that you know they dont want to buy for themselves. And accept that maybe she just wont ever feel comfortable dressing in more masculine clothing or taking on a more butch persona.\n\n\nMy partner is tough to buy for - half the time he doesnt even get on with the clothes he buys himself. But I try to buy things that work with his style, not whatever I might want him to wear.\n\nYour friends are right, younger those clothes because you wanted to see her in them, not because she would like those clothes.", "Holy cheesus cracker is your gf a femme lawyer who's into women??? Dear universe if that woman dumps OP please send her my way. I just want one chance, I would never fumble the bag like some people (OP).", "Wow! Totally AH move\u2026.", "YTA for sure.\n\nImagine how insecure she must be feeling when you tell her you're attracted to other masculine women. You're asking her to change herself so you can be happy. If you truly loved her, you would enjoy her either way you can. \n\nUnfortunately, you're not only attracted to the masculine dressing style, but also the women themselves. You can try to deny it but you're not really being loving towards your girlfriend. I feel bad for her.", "YTA. That gift wasn't for her. It was for you.   \nThe tradition works because everyone gifts something the receiver will enjoy. You bypassed that to make yourself happy. \n\nAlso, talking about other people being hot is a sensitive subject. Made worse when you tell her you're attracted to a completely different type of woman. It sounds like you used little tact in that part of the conversation.   \nThen again, this entire situation makes it seem like you worried more about yourself than you did about her and her feelings.", "YTA. Stop trying to change your girlfriend.", "YTA. \n\nAre you dumb or lying? \n\nWhen something is \u201cat the bottom of someone\u2019s list\u201d of things to buy, it means they do not want it. It is not important to them. \n\nWhen you buy someone a gift, you\u2019re supposed to pick something that is at the *top* of their list. Something they really want. \n\nThis whole, \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t have to spend her money on it\u201d line is a hoot. Guess what. She wouldn\u2019t have to spend her money on it. Because she doesn\u2019t want it.", "YTA. Too much too soon. You should\u2019ve just got her a hoodie or a cap. Maybe some shoes, but it sounds like you got her a whole new wardrobe. And if you don\u2019t like how she looks anymore, then maybe you should cut her loose and move on. Trying to change her is not the way.", "......So.....\n\nYour gift to your GF was to objectify her? \n\nI do not have the mental energy to string together the right words to express to you how disgusting that is. Absolutely unacceptable.\n\nBut the fact that you doubled down on this after your GF told you how she felt? Oh hunny, you had a lot of nerve already, but to come to this sub to even ask if you were TA after all of that? They're gonna eat you alive. Good luck with that. \n\nYTA.", "Yes YTA. You are doing this to honor a friend who passed. You are honoring love and friendship. And you chose to give her clothes she wouldn\u2019t choose for herself that look like some random people on tiktok that you are attracted to. I don\u2019t think I can even call that a gift. And it\u2019s not fair to her. She deserves to be in a relationship with someone that wants her for her and is happy to see her clothing herself the way she feels best. She is not a dress up doll or a tool for you to live out your fantasies.", "Yes, YTA. 1. You are making her feel like shit by comparing her to people on Tiktok. Like, are you for real?? 2. A gift is something the RECIPIENT should want. Buying this stuff for her at a non gift giving occasion may have been fine, if she was really on board. But you should've gotten her something SHE wanted for this gathering. You aren't saving her money by buying her something she never wanted in the first place. \n\nAlso the lingerie comparisons aren't quite right - masc and femme can be identities/personalities as well as styles and you are really rejecting her by saying her whole personality/style isn't hot to you.", "YTA - one femme to another, I\u2019m not sure why you are asking us when she already told you how she felt directly. She doesn\u2019t have to dress in masc styles bc you like them. The gift was in poor taste and did not consider her preferences at all. Tiktok is not real life and frankly, you\u2019re too old to not know that.", "YTA. If you want to be with a masc woman, date a masc woman. Don't try to make your girlfriend change herself to suit your tastes.", "I think you may have been able to handle this one a more tactful way - eg give your partner a gift voucher for a clothing store that stocks the kinds of clothes you'd like her to wear, send her some private messages with pictures of the sort of style you'd like her to wear so she gets the gist of what you're hoping for, and then let her scroll through to find something that she might be not-adverse to wearing on her own time.\n\nI get what you were trying to do, my partner and I have occasionally sent each other pictures of garments we would like to see the other wearing and then made gifts of the items that received the sort of \"yeah OK I wouldn't mind wearing that for you now and again\" response, but this was all private and just between us.\n\nEssentially you've given your partner a fetish gift in front of a group of people who don't need to know the ins and outs of your fantasies. Not too dissimilar to gifting them edible underwear or sex toys. Granted the gifts themselves weren't explicit, but your partner knew these garments were intended to increase your arousal and that was embarrassing for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

First, you don't tell your partner unless you are on the firmest of firm footings that you're heavily into a thing that's *the complete opposite of what they are* because you've essentially told her she isn't your ideal, and you don't find her attractive.

You\u2019re welcome to gift her clothes that you would like her to try if she\u2019s open to it, but not at a time when you should\u2019ve been gifting her something FOR her. This was 100% a gift for you and a selfish choice.", "YTA. IF she dressed more masculinely, she would be doing you a favor. It's like you got her a laundry hamper for a gift to get her to do more chores.", "This is like when men buy lingerie for their partners thinking it\u2019s a gift for them, but in reality it\u2019s a gift for the guy. Op, you are an asshole and you bought yourself a gift without giving a damn about your gf and what she actually wants. You need to apologize to her for being a selfish asshole and get her a gift for her. People with dignity do not want gifts from their partners so they can be sexualized. Your gf has dignity and YTA.", "This is even worse than getting a household gift the giver wanted for both to use... because in the process you sexualize her and press your values of what she should look like on her. I dont think your relation is going to work if you continue acting this way. YTA, for the gift and the attitude/ comments about how she dresses.", "Fr, like of you wanted to truly do something nice for her, buy her the clothes she's been saving up for instead, that way she can do whatever she wants with the money she's been saving (probably wouldn't be buying masculine clothing, but it would have maybe repaired some of the damage done by pushing it on her). But ofc op wouldn't do that, that doesn't get them any closer to their tiktok fantasy. YTA.", "This is even worse than someone buying their SO lingerie for their enjoyment - OP wants their GF to change her whole identity. \n\nOp describes this Tiktok fashion as almost some  kind of fetish, and despite the GF's obvious discomfort, OP decided to \"gift\" these unwanted clothes to her GF in public. OP in essence turned a memorial for their friend into a platform to publicly force a kink costume onto their GF.... Even the friends knew that this was **not** something that the GF would enjoy or appreciate.", "As another lesbian, I completely agree YTA clothes are such a part of self expression, and making your partner wear new clothes to fit a new form of self expression they aren't even interested in is way out of line. Like, if you want to date masculine women, date masculine women. Don't force your girlfriend to fit an ideal she's not interested in.", ">This is the lady love equivalent of a man buying his wife lingerie he likes for her birthday, on top of implying OP is more attracted to people who are not their girlfriend.\n\nAnd what's wrong with any of that?", "As somone who likes all genders( pansexual) that is such a toxic thing to spread. I like really femine girls and really manly men. I wouldnt ask my boyfriend to wear femine clothes because i like a mix of both. It sounds like your type is changing and thats ok but dont force it on your gf please.", "Pretty sure the bi's of reddit have spoken.   \nThis is not \"natural\" as a bi person. It's your preference - and that's okay, just freaking own it as a preference and don't lump us all in the same boat. I like androgyny, masc women and \"normal\" guys.", "OP - this is.... pretty gross. \n\nYou are basically saying \"I am bisexual, so it should be obvious sometimes I would want a man, so my GF needs to man up.\" \n\nThis is like a bisexual man gifting his male partner dresses and other traditionally feminine clothing and demanding them to play the part of a woman, for their enjoyment.", "Don't bring bisexuality into it. Your not ready for a committed relationship if you feel the need to change your gfs aesthetic to match what you would prefer.", "Oh so this relationship is solely on your needs and so she music change herself to fit your needs.\n\nGrow up.", "GTFO, I\u2019m bisexual and I\u2019m more than happy with my partner exactly the way they are, my sexuality isn\u2019t some set of scales that needs equal amounts of masc and femme on it at all times otherwise I\u2019ll pout and feel unfulfilled. You\u2019re just making an excuse that makes all bisexual people seem like greedy assholes that need to take a bite out of every chocolate flavour in the box or they\u2019ll go to bed hungry when actually the problem is 100% you - YTA.", "But is that your girl? Was she ever comfortable to begin with? Just because she said she would try it doesn't guarantee she would like it at all or that she really wanted to in the first place, she could have just been saying it to please you and the fact it wasn't a priority for her should've said a lot. You were asking her to change a fundamental part of her style to tailor her to the image of other people you were attracted to. It wasn't a gift to compliment her own style and likes, but to change them.", "Not just in public, but at a memorial for their deceased friend...", "You're the one that wanted her to wear this. Her getting this isn't for her, it's for you. Why would you think that was a good gift?", "I had a partner that gifted me clothes totally not to my taste too, and beyond that, they were like -- kinda slutty and impractical.  Tube tops etc.  I honestly don't see how this is any different.  \n\nThis was a queer relationship too.  More accurately, we were both AFAB and they were planning on transitioning.  So dressing me ultra femme played into their desire to appear more masculine (I also wasn't allowed to wear boots anymore, and no heels either so I wouldn't be taller than them). \n\nWe have enough hetero bullshit being forced on us already, do we have to have a 'lipstick' one and a 'butch' one to be seen as a real couple?  Nothing wrong with finding that attractive, but it's not right to force your gf into that role, especially in public like that.  Also a big sign of control issues, big ol' red flag there.", "Why are you trying to change your gf in the first place. This is cruel", "*It wasn't anything inappropriate like lingerie, it was simply masculine/gender neutral clothes and accessories: men's blouses, oversized jacket, pants, etc...*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat she doesn't like! Why did you think that it would be a great idea to give her something that she doesn't like and why can't you see why she is upset about it? YTA.", "It is still wanting your GF to dress up how you want so you can get your jollies, and making a public show of it.", "You are totally missing the point. You bought things for yourself and pretended they were actually a present for her. Total dick move. If you don\u2019t want your girlfriend as she is then just move on. Don\u2019t try to completely change her for your selfish reasons. YTA.", "the problem is that ppl don't see clues and only listen to what ppl say. \n\nThe gf made it sound like the only issue not getting is that she doesn't want to spend money on it . so in her head ok I buy it for her so she doesn't need to spend money on it . I get it that it wasn't for her but I also wonder if GF told her what she wanted .the question is , is OP in general a good gift giver or always gives impersonal gift", "Whats wrong with implying you are not attracted to your girlfriend anymore because the women you see on Social Media are so much hotter and look the opposite of your gf? \n\nIf you don't know why thats not ok, you are not ready to be in a relationship with anyone of any gender.", "A birthday gift should be something the recipient actually wants, not something for the sole enjoyment of the gift giver.\n\n(Cf.  Homer Simpson giving Marge a bowling ball that says \"Homer\" on it).", "Yes, the girlfriend is saving up for a handmade dress and a tailored suit. She definitely cares about fashion, she is probably so in tune with her own personal style that it actually reflects who she is as a person. She is putting thought into what she puts on her body and obviously what she feels good in. It\u2019s probably her whole personality also. I know I have friends or family who will see an item in a store and will call me and say I found something and it\u2019s so you. I\u2019m sure she has people like that. And now OP wants to change all that.\nI feel like OP is trying to change who she really is.", "I just dont understand. Obviously, the person you're dating is not going to be the most physically attractive person in the world. You should never be penalized for honesty, so there should be nothing wrong with pointing out how they can become hotter. If she doesnt want to change her appearance, then either of them can end the relationship if they so choose, or she can accept her girlfriend's appearance as it is. It's so simple. It's just so illogical to not hold this view.\n\nAnd dont condescend to me. So disgusting.", "Yes, but if you're in a good relationship, your SO should want what you want because it will make you happy. The gift is still ostensibly for her. What better opportunity is there for you to give it? You just gonna buy it separately and say \"I want you to wear this.\"? It's all the same.\n\nAlso you should read this part my other comment to understand how stupid I think gift-giving is generally to better understand my perspective:\n\n>Gift-giving, as normally practiced, is stupid and inefficient. 99% of the time, you know what you want more than other people, so there's no actual point in giving gifts unless people are sharing wishlists (which no one does). And if you're dating, you're basically sharing finances anyway so it like extra doesnt matter.", "If your partner values receiving thoughtful birthday gifts and your response is \"That's stupid, I'm just going to get you something *I* like\", that makes you selfish and not a good partner. \n\nIf you want your partner to wear something in particular that gets you off sexually, you can ask nicely and just give it to them any old time if they agree. Giving it to them as *their sole birthday present* is going to be badly received and considered thoughtless by the vast majority of people."]}
