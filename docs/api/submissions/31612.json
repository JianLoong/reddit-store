I\u2019m a 31F and last week, my boyfriend 30M asked if he could use my car to go and pick up his friends from the airport. I asked him why he couldn\u2019t use his car and he said that his is booked in for maintenance that day and mine was bigger anyway. I checked what time the flight got in, worked out the time with work and said no problem, he can take my car. This morning he gets ready and asks where the keys are. I tell him they\u2019re on the key tray and he says, no the Ferrari keys. Background: The Ferrari  is a 328 that I inherited because my Dad died less than 2 months ago. \nI tell him there\u2019s no way he is driving the Ferrari and he could use the Land Rover which was what I agreed to.

He got pissed and said that his friends were expecting him to show up with a Ferrari and that they were excited about going for a drive in it. We got into a shouting match and I kicked him out of my apartment and told him he\u2019s not taking the Land Rover either and he and his friends can work their own way of getting home. I went to work, took all of the keys with me and now I\u2019m getting messages from him saying he can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t trust him and took all the car keys and from his mum and dad telling me I need to go to therapy because I\u2019m too attached to things and that my Dad is gone and being possessive over his belongings is not healthy.

They were only made for four years, and they are expensive because of their rarity in good condition.  \n\nIn fact, it\u2019s so weird to have in the post that I almost think this is fake and advertising for either Ferrari or Land Rover.
