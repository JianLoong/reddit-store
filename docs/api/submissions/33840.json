She had also been telling my boyfriends sibling to kiss baby quickly before we see however his sibling refused.

I applaud you taking every step you can to keep your baby safe. RSV and COVID are running rampant, and these are particularly deadly diseases for children who have no immunity. If she truly loved her grandchild, she would want to do everything in her power to keep that baby safe, even from herself. Instead, she has made this into a power tug of war with two teenagers. Feel free to stick to your guns and keep your distance.", "NTA. She sounds very controlling. You can\u2019t give people like that an inch. What happens when it\u2019s not kissing, but avoiding potential allergens or something more serious? She needs to realize it\u2019s your baby, your rules. Good for your husband for sticking by your side on this too. Congrats on the baby!", "NTA\n\nShe is even worse than my monster in law. \n\nGood for that you put your foot down and that bf is standing by you.\n\nI hope you have found a safe place to be and you will manage without MILs \u00abhelp\u00bb", "NTA And set the flying monkeys straight when they come crawling. If they don't listen or understand than simply block them. No skin off your back.

She has made it abundantly clear that the baby\u2019s health and safety will always play second fiddle to her desires. \n\n1. She flat out admitted she thinks she has the right to do whatever she wants\n\n2. She kept kissing the baby when you told her not to\n\n3.

This woman is sneaky and controlling. She kicked you out with no notice and a two week old baby. Just stay away from her. Don\u2019t let her in your home. And don\u2019t tell her anything about yourselves or your baby. She\u2019s unsafe to be around.", "NTA. You have excellent boundaries for people your age & I'm so proud of both of you for being so proactive about her health. RSV is as deadly as you're treating it, and your MIL is an AH for disrespecting you as parents just because you lived there. I have a friend who is a new grandma whose grandson lives with there, and she is so respectful of her role. It's not okay to hold it over your head. You guys are doing a great job.", "NTA What the hell is wrong with people? Why do they think they can trample boundaries like that? RSV, whooping cough, the flu, covid, etc. are all running rampant right now. Your baby doesn't have enough immunities to do well if she gets RSV or anything else.

They both got sick with RSV this past month. They both got ear infections and had ten days worth of antibiotics. My daughter's lungs got infected. She ran feverish for over two weeks, has had a cough for over a month, and is still unable to run or do physical activity without coughing so hard she pukes. The doctors have told us that rsv, pneumonia, and upper respiratory infections are going around lately. Bottom line, if my 7 year old is struggling and having long form RSV, just imagine what could happen to your newborn with no immune system. Your mil seems horrible, unremorseful or uneducated about the dangers of kissing a baby on the face and it's super important for your child's health that you keep anyone unsafe away from them. The fact that she would go behind your back and put your child in danger speaks volumes about what kind of person she is. I hope you are able to keep her away and have a safe life without too much drama. She seems vindictive though. Good luck OP!", "I agree. It is also not only for RSV but also other deceases like herpes. This could possibly end your baby\u2019s life (RSV or any other virus could also do this) or make your baby go blind. My baby got RSV without being kissed by others. Was just unlucky. We were lucky he pulled through. He was 4 months old and is now 17 months old but he was ill for a long time and we still have medical appointments one year later because it triggered something in him they don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t always prevent them getting sick but you can minimize the possibility. Especially with a baby that is just a few months. \n\nI hope OP and her spouse will keep up the good teamwork. That is so important!", "There is obviously something to be said for respecting your elders. But I think in past generations they ruled with an iron fist. Now they struggle to understand that respect is earned and goes both ways. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t set healthy boundaries. \n\nIt\u2019s very hard for older people to accept change. Many of them struggle with the new \u201crules\u201d and safety regulations when it comes to babies because we know more now. They just see it as the younger generations being paranoid and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d.", "Doctors specifically state not to let newborn babies be kissed except by mom and dad because the risk of transmitting diseases is much higher, especially RSV or HSV, since mouths are particularly germy", "No, don\u2019t trust her even then.

No kissing the baby unless you\u2019re one of the parents.", "In the post they mentioned that mil stated okay I'll just have to kiss his little toesies or feet or whatever it was. They never said they disagreed with that. It made less sense to me than kissing the baby on top of the head.

When my kids were babies, I offended a lot of people by telling them no kissing or to wash their hands.  It's amazing how people get mad instead of respecting the safety of a newborn.  Your baby cannot speak, so it's up to the parents to make sure the baby is safe.  Babies have died from RSV.  When it comes to your kids, never ever back down from your boundaries, no matter who gets mad at you.  They're your kids and you/bf are the ones who make the rules, not anyone else.\n\nThis is your baby's life at stake here.  Not only is she being horrible, she's encouraging others to be as well.  I'm glad your bf is backing you up on this.  I suggest you both block everyone and focus on your own family now.  Tell her where to shove those presents.  Let her lie to people, she can say whatever she wants and if people chose to believe it, that's on them.  Not your problem now.\n\nEven if you're struggling, never go back to her home.

At least now you won\u2019t be dealing with character assassination *and* a critically ill newborn.", "Yah big time NTA.  My granddaughter will be 1 on Saturday.  When she was born I was scared of all the sicknesses going around.  NO kissing the baby is a very solid boundary to set.  Your MIL just wants to be in control.  And for her kicking you guys out with a newborn, how horrible.  Hopy you have a safe place to live.  I had my first at 16 and 2nd by 18.

With a new baby this year we all got our pertussis update and the RSV vaccine when recommended. It's outrageously inconsiderate to not do so.

Why is she being so obnoxious and obstinate when it's so easy to accommodate these young parents?  \nOP, keep up the good work.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sick of people thinking they can do whatever they want with other peoples babies. RSV is no fucking joke. My LO was born mid September and we made sure EVERYONE knew throughout the entire pregnancy that NO kissing on the face was allowed. Under any circumstance. Only mom and dad get to kiss baby\u2019s face. And I worried that people would fight me but luckily, everyone was okay with it. Are the grandparents disappointed? Absolutely. But guess what? I\u2019ve never seen them kiss my LO\u2019s face. My mom will kiss the top of his head. My maternal grandmother kissed him one time on the face and I just reminded her not to. She apologized and has never done it since. \n\nBabies are humans. Not accessories.

You were 17 years old, shacking up in her house, can't support yourselves, but you think it's a good idea to get pregnant and have a kid? All of this could have been avoided if you had waited until you could support yourselves and had a place of your own before you had a kid. You tried to put boundaries on your boyfriend's mom while living under her roof, while she is probably helping/assisting with the baby. It was never going to end well.\n\nNTA - For the presents thing though. I mean if you don't want your kid to have their grandparent in their life or for them to get gifts from them that's your prerogative.", "Not letting other people kiss your newborn is a completely reasonable boundary. Covid, flu, RSV, whooping cough, herpes. All dangerous to newborns and all transmissible via kissing. You\u2019re adults making adult decisions and she doesn\u2019t *owe* you a place to live.

And while it is rare for a baby, especially an older baby to die from herpes it is possible, especially if not taken to the doctor and properly cared for. Hopefully someone with a cold sore would not be kissing a baby at all but as I said above a baby can reach out and touch a person's face who has a cold sore and then touch their own again. Certainly and absolutely all due care has to be taken around babies."]}
