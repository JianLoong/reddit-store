During most of my pregnancy I had been living with my boyfriend, his mom & his siblings. When I first announced my pregnancy my MIL was not supportive and asked if I would consider an abortion. She blamed me for ruining her sons future, she eventually felt excited for her first grandchild and wanted to be involved. 4 weeks before my babies due date I had posted a list of boundaries for family & friends to read. We had made to clear we didnt want anyone kissing baby as we didnt want to risk RSV. my MIL said to me \"Im sad about the no kissing rule, but she is your baby. ill just kiss her feet instead\" After baby was born my bf had caught her kissing baby and told her not to and she laughed it off. Again while im not in the room he catches her kissing baby and she says \"shhhh our little secret\" and he says no, takes baby from her and says he isnt hiding it from me. She says shes the grandparent so she can do whatever she wants with our daughter while in her house. She had also been telling my boyfriends sibling to kiss baby quickly before we see however his sibling refused. My bf told her to stop being controlling so she kicked us out and said \"Im more then happy not being part of that babies life\" We struggled to find somewhere to go as we needed somewhere safe for our 2 week old. A few months pass with no contact and my boyfriends sibling tells us that my MIL has bought christmas presents for our baby but she cannot have them unless we bring baby to hers and shes allowed to do whatever she wants with baby. We told her she cant just buy her way back into baby's life and she isnt seeing her espesially without apologising to us. She has been lying about the whole situation to everyone saying we had been using her for a place to stay, and mentally messing with her by not letting her see her grandaughter, etc.", "created_utc": 1703678785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18rz94g/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_give_christmas/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also your boyfriend did a good job standing up to her and showing that the two of you are a team. \nDo NOT give in to her, she\u2019s literally trying to buy you with gifts and is gonna stomp on even more boundaries.", "NTA. I applaud you taking every step you can to keep your baby safe. RSV and COVID are running rampant, and these are particularly deadly diseases for children who have no immunity. If she truly loved her grandchild, she would want to do everything in her power to keep that baby safe, even from herself. Instead, she has made this into a power tug of war with two teenagers. Feel free to stick to your guns and keep your distance.", "NTA. She sounds very controlling. You can\u2019t give people like that an inch. What happens when it\u2019s not kissing, but avoiding potential allergens or something more serious? She needs to realize it\u2019s your baby, your rules. Good for your husband for sticking by your side on this too. Congrats on the baby!", "NTA\n\nShe is even worse than my monster in law. \n\nGood for that you put your foot down and that bf is standing by you.\n\nI hope you have found a safe place to be and you will manage without MILs \u00abhelp\u00bb", "NTA And set the flying monkeys straight when they come crawling. If they don't listen or understand than simply block them. No skin off your back. She simply helped you push out and break away from her and now she's understanding she messed up and is trying to bring you back. Don't let the cycle of abuse continue. Don't go back. NTA!!", ">. A few months pass with no contact and my boyfriends sibling tells us that my MIL has bought christmas presents for our baby but she cannot have them unless we bring baby to hers and shes allowed to do whatever she wants with baby.\n\nYour daughter is not a prop for this woman to play with. \n\nNTA. \n\nDon't give in. She's proven she won't respect your boundaries whatsoever.", "NTA\nThis BS about grandparents thinking they have the right to do as they please with their grandkids is absurd. Did they not have boundaries and rules when it came to their kids and grandparents.", "NTA. MIL sounds toxic. \n\nOn another note, however, I don't even understand how kissing the baby is going to do any more damage than breathing around it. Unless of course they're kissing the baby on the mouth instead of the forehead or top of the head.", "Yeah don\u2019t let her back into your life and don\u2019t accept those presents. She has made it abundantly clear that the baby\u2019s health and safety will always play second fiddle to her desires. \n\n1. She flat out admitted she thinks she has the right to do whatever she wants\n\n2. She kept kissing the baby when you told her not to\n\n3. She actually made you and your two week old homeless for trying to protect them against potential deadly illnesses!", "Good luck for the future for the 3 of you. Good riddance to the MIL from hell. Don\u2019t look back and have a good New Year.", "NTA\n\n>She says shes the grandparent so she can do whatever she wants with our daughter\n\nSo much wrong with this I don't even know where to begin.... Disgusting mindset. She can't respect boundaries, she can't be trusted, I'd also go no contact to be honest.", "NTA - she made her 2 week old grandbaby homeless because she couldn\u2019t kiss their face and will withhold gifts unless she \u201cgets to do whatever she wants with the baby\u201d?\n\nWell, that\u2019s just disgusting. \n \nYour baby doesn\u2019t need toys so much as a safe place to live, but she denied them that because she didn\u2019t get to do whatever she wanted, which included putting the baby at risk for potentially serious health risks. \n\nAnything from her is the literal definition of \u201cstrings attached.\u201d If she can kick her grandbaby out, she\u2019ll rip whatever rug out from underneath you the moment she doesn\u2019t get whatever she wants. Stay far, far away from her, no matter the promises", "NTA. Do whatever she wants? What does that mean?? Kissing your baby and getting her sick? Taking her on vacation without you? FGM? This woman is sneaky and controlling. She kicked you out with no notice and a two week old baby. Just stay away from her. Don\u2019t let her in your home. And don\u2019t tell her anything about yourselves or your baby. She\u2019s unsafe to be around.", "NTA. You have excellent boundaries for people your age & I'm so proud of both of you for being so proactive about her health. RSV is as deadly as you're treating it, and your MIL is an AH for disrespecting you as parents just because you lived there. I have a friend who is a new grandma whose grandson lives with there, and she is so respectful of her role. It's not okay to hold it over your head. You guys are doing a great job.", "NTA What the hell is wrong with people? Why do they think they can trample boundaries like that? RSV, whooping cough, the flu, covid, etc. are all running rampant right now. Your baby doesn't have enough immunities to do well if she gets RSV or anything else. Doctors say don't let people kiss the babies because of it. You need to go complete no contact with this B until she absolutely apologizes and agrees to abide by your rules.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They both got sick with RSV this past month. They both got ear infections and had ten days worth of antibiotics. My daughter's lungs got infected. She ran feverish for over two weeks, has had a cough for over a month, and is still unable to run or do physical activity without coughing so hard she pukes. The doctors have told us that rsv, pneumonia, and upper respiratory infections are going around lately. Bottom line, if my 7 year old is struggling and having long form RSV, just imagine what could happen to your newborn with no immune system. Your mil seems horrible, unremorseful or uneducated about the dangers of kissing a baby on the face and it's super important for your child's health that you keep anyone unsafe away from them. The fact that she would go behind your back and put your child in danger speaks volumes about what kind of person she is. I hope you are able to keep her away and have a safe life without too much drama. She seems vindictive though. Good luck OP!", "I agree. It is also not only for RSV but also other deceases like herpes. This could possibly end your baby\u2019s life (RSV or any other virus could also do this) or make your baby go blind. My baby got RSV without being kissed by others. Was just unlucky. We were lucky he pulled through. He was 4 months old and is now 17 months old but he was ill for a long time and we still have medical appointments one year later because it triggered something in him they don\u2019t know. You can\u2019t always prevent them getting sick but you can minimize the possibility. Especially with a baby that is just a few months. \n\nI hope OP and her spouse will keep up the good teamwork. That is so important!", "There is obviously something to be said for respecting your elders. But I think in past generations they ruled with an iron fist. Now they struggle to understand that respect is earned and goes both ways. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t set healthy boundaries. \n\nIt\u2019s very hard for older people to accept change. Many of them struggle with the new \u201crules\u201d and safety regulations when it comes to babies because we know more now. They just see it as the younger generations being paranoid and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d.", "Doctors specifically state not to let newborn babies be kissed except by mom and dad because the risk of transmitting diseases is much higher, especially RSV or HSV, since mouths are particularly germy", "No, don\u2019t trust her even then. She is sneaky and deceitful. She has shown she can\u2019t be trusted.", "It\u2019s unfortunate my parents helped me raise my son from birth him and his wife live with my parents and they never crossed my boundaries and they were his other parent.", "She can't kiss the baby on the top of the head but she can kiss its fingers and toes which she will in turn stick in her mouth and suck on.", "She can\u2019t kiss the babies fingers or toes either\u2026 for that reason. No kissing the baby unless you\u2019re one of the parents.", "In the post they mentioned that mil stated okay I'll just have to kiss his little toesies or feet or whatever it was. They never said they disagreed with that. It made less sense to me than kissing the baby on top of the head. (Baby can't lick, suck, or bite her own forehead or top of her head but she can bite her hands and feet, fingers and toes thus getting germs from the kisses in her mouth  easier that way.\n\nAlthough I stated that mil you should respect their boundaries regardless."]}
