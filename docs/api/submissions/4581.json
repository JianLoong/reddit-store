If so I\"d go Y T A because I would absokutely get rid of an addict that way", "OP said  one of the males involved believe in divorce, and the ex was trying to make her have a child before she was ready. All the men in this are the AHs", "It's sketchy but I feel that her refusing to provide any details is worse. I'm fairly confident if we knew what the wife did it would be ESH at the least", "OP commented that it is the divorce. They don't approve.", "I think there's a lot of cultural context here that would help explain why everyone but the OP thinks it's okay to treat a woman this way.", "Reading between the lines and from OP\u2019s responses, I\u2019m guessing the family and friends are part of a culturally or religiously conservative community that doesn\u2019t believe in divorce.", "She didn't say what he said.... for all we know it was \"there is the person who slept with my father on my bed!!!\"\n\nThis story is very selectively leaving out important details.", "She never cheated.", "The more I read and reread the post and OP's comments, the more I'm convinced that Sarah is a master manipulator that has somehow convinced the OP that the entire world is out to get her, and none of what she's going through are consequences of Sarah's own actions.\n\nSource: I have a toxic AF sister that I'm convinced is borderline. She had everyone convinced her ex was harassing and terrifying her. It turned out, sister is abusive and he had to move across the country to get away from her.", "Thanks for pointing that out. \n\nThen yeah, NTA.", "Ty", "My guess is that she got pregnant but decided to abort and the husband wanted to keep it. Which would explain why the relationship ended on such a bitter note and why the husband's still comfortable being friends with the ex", "Yeah.  This just doesn't make sense.  Everyone, including her parents and her own friends, is disowning her because of a divorce ?  This just seems untrue or only part of the truth.", "What did the ex say when he was yelling in public... specifically..?", ">I don't believe you it doesn't make sense that everyone disown her", "Or . . .  it's Religion", "Could be a religious/cultural thing.", "I'm guessing she did something outrageously egregious that OP is ok with, which is why OP is specifically leaving out that detail and what the Ex yelled about.\n\nI hope OP's husband realizes whatever it is, his wife is down to do it, too.", "It\u2019s actually extremely common in certain religious communities for a spouse that leaves, even if it\u2019s because of abuse, to be completely ostracized. It\u2019s not far fetched at all.", "that may be true but she as not tell us where she lives and she fighting with her husband you don't think they will disown if that where true and her husband and friends told her she doesn't understand what's really happening so that means she in the dark about things or she's lying"]}
