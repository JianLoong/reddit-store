There is also a video or two of her of her singing Christmas songs for the family on Christmas morning.\n\nSince that time, my daughter attended and graduated university with a music performance degree. And these videos have been online for **years**, with no complaints from her.\n\nAbout six months ago, however, my daughter asked us if we could remove these videos. I asked why, and she said they are embarrassing and if anyone would search her name, she doesn't want people to see these old videos of her singing \"badly.\"\n\nHer father and I said no, we're keeping them up. To me, she should be proud of where she came from and not worry about what other people think. And the kicker? It's not that she has any new videos of her singing since then, or that she plans to upload any time soon, though she said she \"might\" in the future. Honestly, my daughter has very half-assed done music since she graduated (3 years ago), so I don't know why she has made these videos the target of her hatred.\n\nShe has asked again for us to take them down a few months after the first time, and then a last time just a week ago. I've already told her to not ask me again, they're staying up. Especially as these are videos we recorded with our camera so it is our property.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667501563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylb6hc/aita_for_not_taking_my_daughters_singing_videos/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Respect her wish YTA\n\nEdit after reading OPs comments:\nYou keep comparing your daughters videos to old celebrity videos and want to push her to post videos. Seems like you want your daughter to become famous for your own benefit. You are not her manager, you can't make money out of her.

Keep and enjoy them for yourselves but take them down.", "YTA.  She doesn't even need a reason, if she wants them down, take them down.  Are the videos and likes more important than the trust of your child?", "The videos are of her.\nShe gets to make the decision.", "YTA. They are videos of her.

Unless she has adopted a new stage name, those videos might be the first thing that pops up. That\u2019s unfair to your daughter. Take them down as she requested.", "YTA. She's just asking you to take them down from publicly searchable websites, not asking you to delete them completely.

To me, she should be proud of where she came from and not worry about what other people think. \n\nThat philosophy may be fine for you, but making that decision for her isn't okay. Just because she doesn't want to risk being ridiculed over videos she's embarrassed about, that doesn't mean she's not proud of where she came from.\n\n> Honestly, my daughter has very half-assed done music since she graduated (3 years ago), so I don't know why she has made these videos the target of her hatred.\n\nMaybe she only recently realised that they come up in a search for her name?  Maybe a friend found them and brought it up. It doesn't really matter, she's been reminded of them somehow and they make her uncomfortable. Regarding your rather mean comment about her half-assing music, have you considered that maybe she wants to post something, but isn't doing so because she doesn't want people to then come across the old videos.\n\n> She has asked again for us to take them down a few months after the first time, and then a last time just a week ago. We say no, especially as these are videos we recorded with our camera so it is our property.\n\nSo she's expressed her discomfort to you multiple times now, and it's clearly bothering her. Don't you care that you're deliberately making your child uncomfortable?\n\nAside from that, she\u2019s the subject of those videos and has asked you to take them down, so you should. It doesn\u2019t matter who owns the device used to film them.

In fact, what you're describing is not only immoral, it's also illegal in many countries. While the video is indeed \"your property\" (so you could act against people who copy it and monetise it), you are not allowed to publish pictures or footage of people without their consent. Moreover, their consent can be withdrawn at any time. You are violating your daughter's fundamental right to privacy.

Please take them down and salvage what you can of your relationship.", "YTA. You've made it abundantly clear you don't respect your daughter otherwise, you would do as she asked, regardless of how you feel about her request.\n\nI have never, ever posted pictures or videos of my daughter online and won't even share them  privately with family and friends without her express permission.

You are keeping them up based on some weird principle that she shouldn't care what people think, however, no matter what career she is pursuing, she will be googled, and it's absolutely reasonable for her not to want old videos to come up when future employers look her up. \n\nWhat you are showing her is that your opinion on her and her life is more important than hers. Consent can be revoked anytime, and that includes consent to share her on social media. Did you even ask her if you could post the videos before you did so originally?", "Y are absolutely TA.", "YTA in a major way", "YTA. You can keep them privately for your own viewing, or even change the setting to private/unsearchable or viewed by link only. Why is it so important to you to keep it public? \n\nRespect her request.

If someone asks you to take down videos or photos of themselves, you do it.", "YTA. Wow.", "YTA. Is it worth damaging your relationship with your daughter over this, because by behaving this way and not listening to her feelings, you are.

You can maybe make them private or taken them down and view them another way. Is it really worth hurting your relationship with your daughter or hurting her in general?

I asked why, and she said they are embarrassing and if anyone would search her name, she doesn't want people to see these old videos of her singing \"badly.\"\n\nHer father and I said no, we're keeping them up. To me, she should be proud of where she came from and not worry about what other people think. And the kicker? It's not that she has any new videos of her singing since then, or that she plans to upload any time soon, though she said she \"might\" in the future. Honestly, my daughter has very half-assed done music since she graduated (3 years ago), so I don't know why she has made these videos the target of her hatred. \n\nShe has asked again for us to take them down a few months after the first time, and then a last time just a week ago.
