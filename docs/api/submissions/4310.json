If there are further details needed, let me know in the comments. \nMine (27f) and my mother\u2019s (62f) relationship has been difficult for about 13 years due to many reasons. Recently, I let her come to a bridal gown appt where everyone there- including myself and her- loved a certain dress I picked out. Later, she stated it was awful and \u201cshowed cellulite on my ass\u201d (I am sporty and a UK 10-12 but have suffered like many women with my body image and trying to convince myself that I am not crazily obese when I look in the mirror). This started a feud between her and I where I tried to make her accountable for the hurtful comment (she made it again about the bridal dress I actually ended up buying on a later occasion) which led to her denying she made the comment at all and that it\u2019s not her fault for the way I have misinterpreted her words (the comment above is a direct quote). A few weeks later, she wrote ridiculously long messages over the span of an hour identifying every single time over the past 3 years where I have accordingly \u201cwronged\u201d her- many of these times it was my retaliation to something she had said or done. Due to my lack of sincerity to her response, she is now trying to claim I stole her wedding ring which she had gifted me months prior to all this. I told her I would return it when I had the chance (I work full time and have a busy social life this time of year due to it being almost Christmas). This was not good enough and she told my brother she will be ringing the police to have me arrested at my workplace for theft and elderly abuse. I ended up messaging her stating how her plan would have failed as I had begun my holidays the day prior to her plan and how this whole stunt of police involvement was low even for her. I then went on to say how she is simply a life giver and not a mother to me and I\u2019m happily ready to live my life like she is already dead. \nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1670564147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgo56x/aita_for_telling_my_living_mother_shes_dead_to_me/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s an unhealthy two way street that you participate in too. You didn\u2019t need to say those awful things, you could just block her and have nothing to do with her. I suspect you haven\u2019t blocked her in every way and you may continue to engage. I would bet money you will have more contact.", "NTA.  Drop the rope, she is dead to you.  Time for NC.", "NTA.

I definitely appreciate and agree with where you are coming from. Prior to the bridal fitting and wedding ring, I did not speak to her for 2 years. In that time, I had gotten engaged and bought a house which she was not part of celebrating. At the beginning of the year I found out she began psychology and decided to try and mend the bridge. All was going well for the 6 months prior to all this hence why I invited her to the bridal gown appt and accepted the wedding ring gift. I should\u2019ve had hind sight but I think I wanted to believe the psychology was truly helping her get better", "Hey thanks for the comment. I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from. I don\u2019t know if this helps or not (maybe I should add as an edit?) but prior to all this, I did go 2 years without contact. During that time I got engaged which she missed out on. The only reason I tried to mend the bridge was I got info through my brother that she had began going to psychology which I thought would benefit her mental health. I think after that, guilt pretty much kicked in and I wanted her to not miss out on any other big life achievements.", "I can promise you I blocked her on FB and her number once I discovered she was trying to get police involved", "I get that. My mom was also super mean, and I invested a lot of time in fighting with her, hoping that she\u2019d change. She never did. And I never got that time back. So I speak from a place of experience."]}
