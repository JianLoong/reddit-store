She was like my sister. So when she didn\u2019t tell me she was pregnant until 6 1/2 months I was bit shocked.

I felt like she didn\u2019t feel the same about me but when she needed me to help out at events I had to be there regardless. So when she told me about her baby shower a month later she had been planning on for a while I told her then I have rsvpd to my husband close cousin birthday party. Since then she\u2019s blocked me from everywhere because I didn\u2019t drop everything for her. Everyone else knew she was pregnant, her family and some of her other close friends. Even then I sent her a gift due to not being able to attend and she didn\u2019t acknowledge it until I messaged to ask if she received. I still reached out multiple times and she wrote back weeks after giving birth that she\u2019s mad I didn\u2019t attend her baby shower and our friendship meant nothing. Im so very confused we\u2019re in our 30s and we live 4 hrs apart. If I wasn\u2019t important enough for her to tell me she\u2019s pregnant why is she upset I didn\u2019t drop everything for her. Her reason for not telling me was that she wasn\u2019t ready to accept she was pregnant and had other stuff going on with in laws. I don\u2019t understand because we spoke everyday about everything and would think she can confide in me. I did say I was bit upset but she said I shouldn\u2019t be upset and if I am there\u2019s nothing she can do about it.", "created_utc": 1678361351, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mptrr/aita_for_not_attending_x_best_friend_baby_shower/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You already had plans and sent her a gift anyway. Also you live 4hrs away and it\u2019s not like you missed a wedding, missing a baby shower is definitely not that big of a deal. She overreacted.", "NTA - Sometimes you find out you're not as close to someone as you thought. Usually you find out in the worst way or at least a bad way. She was never as close to you as you were to her. Life sucks sometimes and so do people...sometimes....", "NTA. You had plans you already RSVPd for. Had she shared the news about her pregnancy with you sooner, you would have also been aware of a baby shower coming up.", "NTA and next time she brings up the friendship, turn it back on her. If she valued your friendship, you wouldn't be the last to know, so re-evaluating the friendship, she can't complain if you attended the baby shower or not as you weren't important enough in the first case. No point being sad about it as its what it is and some people are like this, they want the world to focus on them when it suits them.", "I'd  consider this friendship as over... Sorry to say it.", "It is either:\n- There is a looot not mentioned in this post.\n- or both of you are the most over-reactors in history!\n\nI would slightly lean in your favor, since even though you were too angry she did not tell you about the pregnancy, without asking why she did so (she could have a million valid reason!), at least you kept trying to communicate. \n\nTBH, you might be right, and she is a manipulative AH who only wants what she wants when she wants it, and do not reciprocate. But you didn\u2019t make a good case for yourself either.\n\nAnyways, I guess both of you are better off befriending other people.", "Nta\n\nYour friend sounds very narcissistic and immature.

You already had plans. And she chose to block you rather than talk about it.\n\n\nBut there's got to be more to this story than she didn't tell you until 6.5 months. Do you live nearby? How often do you usually see each other....would you have had to fly/travel for the baby shower? \n\n\nAnd who else did she tell? Did she tell all her other friends? Just family? Just one social media post?\n\n\nDid she wait a long time because of medical issues on her end?\n\n\nIs there a reason she wouldn't tell you? History of infertility or something?", "She didn't tell you because she couldn't except that she was pregnant...but told everyone else?  And that was the best excuse she conjured up?

OP edited their post after I posted my comment, so everything after 'because I didn\u2019t drop everything for her' wasn't something I had to go on with my response.**\n\nI feel like ESH.\n\nBest friend or no, she has no obligation to tell you that she's pregnant until she's ready. It doesn't matter if you'd have acted differently, yourself. It's her choice when to open up about her pregnancy.\n\nFrom your post (I don't know how true this is), it sounds like your disappointment at not being told sooner had a part to play in declining the invitation. Would you have accepted the invitation and gone to the shower instead of the other party, if she'd told you about the pregnancy sooner? Because a baby shower sounds a bit more significant and 'unmissable' than your husband's cousin's party.\n\nThat said, the way she's reacted to you explaining you have other plans also makes her an AH. Could be pregnancy hormones, but I'm not sure that's an excuse.", "Did I overread it or did you not give the reason why she did not tell you?", "I\u2019m torn between ESH and NAH. She isn\u2019t obligated to tell you she\u2019s pregnant but it absolutely does speak volumes of the friendship. Same goes for you not going to her baby shower. You aren\u2019t obligated but it speaks volumes of the friendship.", "Nuclear fusion heads", "This really boils down to your friend is upset that you were unable to attend her baby shower because you had another commitment. The rest is really irrelevant. And you are NTA for not being able to attend.", "NTA. You had plans. I would be a little upset if my friend was pregnant for 6.5 months and told everyone else but me. I can understand waiting 3 months to ensure the pregnancy is viable, but 6 months is excessive for someone that you would consider like a sister. Her comment about you shouldn't be upset and there is nothing she can do is a little insensitive. She can start by recognizing she upset you and apologize for it.", "Your \"friendship \" is over. She's shown that.  Let it and her go.", "NTA. You had plans already. Simple as that. If she really wanted you there she'd have told you ahead of time.", "NTA - it\u2019s good to minimize the number of people in your life who attempt to control you with anger", "ESH", "NTA for having plans, but it is an AH move to feel entitled to her news. She told you why she didn\u2019t tell you, and that\u2019s a perfectly valid reason that you don\u2019t have a right to be upset over. Not everyone is you and wants their friends to know immediately. Some people are more private with their pregnancies and that\u2019s okay.", "Yes, agree. Seems like there may be a lot missing. Will give you the benefit of the doubt - NTA. If friend was as close as you say, she would have told you. It\u2019s unreasonable if her to stay silent for 6.5 months and then get upset that you already had plans for the time of her baby shower. She\u2019s clearly not as close a friend as you think.", "Yup other people knew", "I mean.\n\n3 months of silence is customary. But 6 1/2? And your family and other close friends knew for a while?\n\nI\u2019d be offended too if I was OP.", "Ok well, if she\u2019s under no obligation to tell her BEST FRIEND she\u2019s pregnant for six whole months, then OP is under no obligation to attend the baby shower.", "I did , at the end.", "Everybody else knew about it", "OP has updated the post since I posted my answer. Everything after 'because I didn\u2019t drop everything for her' is a new addition, to me.\n\nThat said, it doesn't really matter what's 'customary', time-wise. It's only the other friends knowing before OP that I can see as being AH-ish.", "**Edit: OP edited the post after I posted my response. Everything following 'because I didn\u2019t drop everything for her' is new to me.**\n\nNo one is under any obligation to tell *anyone* about a pregnancy until they're ready. Best friend, mother, sister. Doesn't matter.\n\nI also never said she was under any obligation to attend the baby shower. Obviously, no one has to attend something they don't want to.\n\nI just think she would suck for *potentially* not going to the shower if it were purely out of spite, because of not being told about the pregnancy earlier \u2014 which is why I asked if she may have gone to the shower if she'd been told about the pregnancy sooner. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Thanks\n\nNta\n\nWhat she does or does not do is on her. Her actions have consequences.", "That\u2019s how OP feels but not necessarily true. Her family and those who can visibly see she\u2019s pregnant likely knew but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone did.", "Idk man, your comment was a few minutes old when I replied.", "Okay? I still didn't see part after that. A few minutes can be a long time when OP is updating their post during the writing of my own comment."]}
