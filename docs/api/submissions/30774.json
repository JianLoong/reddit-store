You are obviously from a different culture than mine.

They can be as shitty as anyone else, and deserve to face the consequences of their actions as much as anyone else. You spoil them by giving them unearned respect. It's bad for their characters. NTA.", "NTA . I generally agree with your feelings and pov. Your uncle sounds like a person who took the word transactional to the extreme . sounds a bit narcissistic to me. However , I would say you can improve on how to deliver your message more effectively, ie. taking the emotion out (however understandable), \"I will not allow you to come here and disrespect my parents . You were never even here to begin with. Please leave \" that way no one can even begin to think you would be the asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's reasonable to stand up for your parents when someone is insulting them. Being an elder doesn't excuse disrespectful behavior. You set a boundary, and if he couldn't respect that, it's his issue. Family should treat each other with respect, and you had every right to ask him to leave.", "Culturally yes YTA. Also congratulations you just created even more problems for your parents. Also I don't think you need western opinions that the people here would give you. That won't save your parents from the backlash that they are going to get because of something you did.
