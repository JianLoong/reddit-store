The assignment was to interview three people in different professions and discuss the commonalities they share and the differences between the various jobs. It was an assignment I thought was a great opportunity for my son to explore his talents and options for his future. \n\nMy son interviewed three people for his project: Our garbage collector, our neighbor who works in finance, and his aunt who does business consulting. My son then crafted a report about his project, noting the differences and similarities between the three professions\n\nHowever, when my son presented his project to his class, the teacher made some inappropriate remarks about his choice of interviewees, saying that \"a trash collector is not an appropriate profession to compare against finance and business consulting\". \"Do you want to end up as a trash collector?\" She asked my son. Of course, this embarrassed him and made his class laugh.\n\nI was not pleased. \n\nSo I set up a meeting with the principal and the teacher and I told her exactly how I felt. I told her that my son should have the freedom to explore whatever avenues he wants to explore. The principal said she understood but \"education and trash collection do not exactly go hand in hand\". The teacher just smiled in a \"we both know I'm right\" kind of way. \n\nI lost it, telling her that she needs to create a more open and accepting environment for students and that if she wants to make her school a better place she needs to stop shunning certain careers.\n\nHere's where I may have gone wrong: I told the teacher that she needs to reconsider her role as an educator if she is going to think so narrow-mindedly.\n\nI know it's not my place to tell an educator to reconsider her role. At the same time though, I don't think it's right for a teacher to discourage a student from exploring their own potential roles in life.\n\nSo AITA?

It is unfortunate that this particular teacher refused to recognize this fact. The moment a person thinks they know everything is when they become an idiot.

Our middle school teachers barely make 36k in Florida while private trash collectors are earning upwards of 200k.", "NTA\nForgot to add that", "There's no financial action that prevents disease, trash collection and sewage maintenance are vital in that area.", "Last summer the binmen in my city went on strike and the local news couldn\u2019t stop going on about how awful it was and how tourists were complaining. I didn\u2019t go into the city centre because it was so gross but it piled up everywhere. It\u2019s such an important necessary job, she shouldn\u2019t belittle it. If no one became a garbage collector because teachers told them it was \u201cbeneath\u201d them imagine the state of our towns and cities.", "I was coming here to say similar. I live in a city with a huge international festival that lasts a month. When our bin collectors think they've had a raw deal, that's when they strike. And then they generally get paid. Doing a manual job doesn't mean you're stupid, and these guys know the value of their work.", "I will give you a like for like that happened in my country. \nThe rubbish collectors went on strike at the same time as the finance sector. One lasted 6 weeks, needed the army to step in and had national outrage. The other had a 6 month talk process in which time the people created a barter and credit system THEMSELVES. We would be surrounded in our filth were it not for the wonderful men (all my rubbish collection people have been male) that get up at stupid am in all weathers to wheel around large plastic containers that stink like gone off cheese to make sure we have room to do it all again next week! They deserve good pay, excellent bonuses and great pensions.", "I agree. With her horrible attitude, this teacher is actively teaching the children to have contempt for blue collar jobs. I would be furious too, if I were OP - who is NTA.", "They absolutely deserve it! So do most blue collar workers, much more than many white collar workers with their ridiculous  salaries.", "I work as a plumber, i made fun of plumbers when i was in middle school because?.....gross right? Till i met a plumber and put him through school. It was beyond fascinating. I met my husband 8-9 years ago....also a plumber lol (yes jebus i got the hint lol).... And we opened a business together, He's the best teacher, and its the best job I've ever had. And don't let me start on the pay. Blue collar jobs keep the world spinning. I learned a deep soul felt respect for anyone with a \"less than desirable\" job.", "When I was a kid it was my dream job! I moved on and am now a dog trainer (also looked down on my my swanky private school but who gives)", "UK based - I didn't have the grades for uni or any idea what I wanted to study after sixth form. I went the apprenticeship route and 10 years later know what I want to do and luckily I can do the degree via work :) \n\nIt might not be the smoothest route but it's worked out in the end!", "You are absolutely right! You are obviously a nice person and she is an absolute snob and shouldn\u2019t be teaching. Does she want to pick up her trash every day and take it to the garbage dump every single day. I don\u2019t think so. They perform an honorable and healthy profession, healthy meaning, they get rid of debris, garbage that can bring vermin and such. This just gets my blood boiling. NTA. NTA. NTA.", "NTA\n\nNo teacher should ever discourage a child from any future that they want to explore. Squashing any kind of ambition or potential in a child is the opposite of what they are supposed to be doing. Not everyone can work in finance or medicine or law. Just imagine. Hideous world.\n\nHave a word with your garbage collector and find out if he can arrange for collection from the school to stop for a little while. Then we\u2019ll see whose job is essential.", "NTA", "NTA many in education have a bias against blue collar workers, especially those who earn substantially more than teachers.", "This. I am a teacher as well and OP is definitely NTA", "> they\u2019re just as important.\n\nThey're way more important.\n\nYou can shoot all the finance parasites and business consultants today and tomorrow the world keeps turning.\n\nBin men go on strike and your city goes to absolute shit in a week, to say nothing of other sanitation-related employees. I shudder to think of what happens if water treatment shuts down.", "I actually love that OP's son interviewed a trash collector, because they are so undervalued and so unseen but so vital to our society. Just because they get their hands dirty does not make their job disrespectable in any way. They are equally as noble a job as any others.\n\nThe teacher is definitely the AH, and the fact that the principle cannot understand that we should all be grateful to all the services rendered by our fellow people, including garbage collectors.", "Yep. It was a great project as this child took 3 completely different types of jobs to compare. And was able to find the similarities, got to see blue collar , white collar, and self employed how they compare. It was impressive that they went and chose such diverse and interesting jobs. And I love how they went to an important overlooked and forgotten job and treated those worker with respect. Horrible teacher to not see and praise such work and thought", "There's literally an episode of Arthur about being a trash collector.  Francine is embarrassed about her Dad's job and her class visits and learns all about it.\n\nLike this quite literally a topic in an educational child's cartoon.", "Sanitation workers are contact workers which would mean an annual based salary.", "NTA. I remember seeing a story somewhere about a hospital where the service workers, including janitors, went on strike. No one to clean surgical rooms, empty garbage cans, refill things. \n\nIt lasted for TWO HOURS before the hospital broke and gave them their demands. \n\nI think you've taught your son some very good lessons about respect and seeing the importance of all kinds of jobs. Kudos.", "It's happened in New York City before. It got pretty bad, and even after just a couple of days the smell was awful.", "There are two groups you should never disrespect: those who cook and/or handle your food and those that keep you from living in your own filth", "Don't disrespect the people who make your world function. You put that perfectly!"]}
