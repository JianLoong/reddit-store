He is also very pragmatic and doesn't take kindly to authority figures who try to shame or bully him. \n\nSo onto the incident at hand. \n\nAbout a month ago, my son was assigned a project in one of his classes. The assignment was to interview three people in different professions and discuss the commonalities they share and the differences between the various jobs. It was an assignment I thought was a great opportunity for my son to explore his talents and options for his future. \n\nMy son interviewed three people for his project: Our garbage collector, our neighbor who works in finance, and his aunt who does business consulting. My son then crafted a report about his project, noting the differences and similarities between the three professions\n\nHowever, when my son presented his project to his class, the teacher made some inappropriate remarks about his choice of interviewees, saying that \"a trash collector is not an appropriate profession to compare against finance and business consulting\". \"Do you want to end up as a trash collector?\" She asked my son. Of course, this embarrassed him and made his class laugh.\n\nI was not pleased. \n\nSo I set up a meeting with the principal and the teacher and I told her exactly how I felt. I told her that my son should have the freedom to explore whatever avenues he wants to explore. The principal said she understood but \"education and trash collection do not exactly go hand in hand\". The teacher just smiled in a \"we both know I'm right\" kind of way. \n\nI lost it, telling her that she needs to create a more open and accepting environment for students and that if she wants to make her school a better place she needs to stop shunning certain careers.\n\nHere's where I may have gone wrong: I told the teacher that she needs to reconsider her role as an educator if she is going to think so narrow-mindedly.\n\nI know it's not my place to tell an educator to reconsider her role. At the same time though, I don't think it's right for a teacher to discourage a student from exploring their own potential roles in life.\n\nSo AITA? I want my son to be successful and happy but was this remark about the teacher going too far?", "created_utc": 1672516708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10029mu/aita_for_telling_my_sons_teacher_to_reconsider/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For example, a qualified chainsaw operator felling a tree with colleagues well within the \u2018danger zone\u2019 and in the direction of felling (we were operating other machinery at the time, didn\u2019t even know what he was doing till it was done. One example of many true stories). Are his colleagues assholes for telling him what they think of potentially having their lives put at risk?\nYou have a point about it not being the best course, however telling someone doesn\u2019t necessarily make you an asshole."]}
