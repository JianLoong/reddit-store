What is his opinion on this? As it seems like you go abroad a lot, why do you not get your own card without a foreign exchange fee?", "INFO: how long do you wait before paying him back?", "INFO: How much work is the word \"normally\" doing here?\n\n> I normally pay him back after", "NTA \n\nThis is a financial agreement between 2 friends and is no one else's business, unless they are insecure about your friendship that is.\n\nWhy people make such a big deal out of nothing will ALWAYS leave me befuddled. So much going on in the world that is actually WORTH the energy to flip sh*t about and yet, this is what they focus on...", "YTA. I bet Nico is not fine with it and you just assumed he was because he went along with it.", "NAH. I'd probably be uncomfortable if I saw my BF was paying everything during a vacation to someone else, especially if she doesn't know about the paying back - or if you're not actually paying for the proper fees/taxes, making Nico pay slightly more.\n\nJust get a proper credit card and solve the problem. Do you intend to ever go on a vacation without nico?", "INFO: I'm curious if on this particular trip it was automatically assumed that Nico would pay with his card and you would pay him back or it was discussed at some point specifically for this trip?", "Be an adult and get yourself a cc with no foreign transaction fees. Its weird to keep relying on someone else.", "INFO: are you slow to pay Nico back? Is he non-confrontational?  I wonder if she\u2019s delivering the message on behalf of him.", "YTA because you expect him to FRONT all your expenses and pay him back later. If this was just about transaction fees, you would just make sure he had a few hundred or whatever you expected to spend ahead of time. Why, pray tell, are you not doing that?", "If you and your friend Nico have this agreement and you DO always pay him then it\u2019s no one else\u2019s business.", "YTA\n\nWhy didn't you guys tell your SO's about this ahead of time? Why don't you get a card with no abroad fees? This whole thing was avoidable had you at least mentioned it to your bf or gotten your own card.", "NAH, but I think now that you and Nico both have partners it's time for you to pay for yourself, or to spilt expenses with your boyfriend instead of Nico.", "Eh soft YTA, especially because your own bf is uncomfortable. How does this work exactly? Your bf buys his own things, and not yours? And Nico buys things for you and you eventually pay him back? As the gf I would be weirded out and annoyed too. You don\u2019t include ages but I assume you\u2019re an adult. Grow up and get a card that doesn\u2019t have foreign fees. Many credit unions and credit cards offer this nowadays.", "Definitly NTA\n\nNico isn't even paying for you, he just lends you money since his card has the better conditions in this case.", "Depends, NTA if you're just explaining it to her that there's nothing fishy, just one friend helping out another to save some money (also what do you do on holiday when Nico isn't there?)\n\nYWBTA if you still continue to ask Nico to do this on future holidays, knowing how upset his girlfriend is about this; because then it isn't just about Nico saving you some fee, it's about you insist on upsetting your friend's partner for your sake. Think about it this way: if someone insist on asking your boyfriend to do something fully knowing it upsets you, how would you feel? Tbh this really should a conversation Nico and his gf have themselves.\n\nI think the best course of action is just get your own comparable card to save fees for future travels.", "NTA. You and your friend have an agreement, and it\u2019s not the girlfriends place to force you to change it. You didn\u2019t specify, but if I\u2019m being heteronormative this reads like perhaps you are a woman, which leads me to believe the girlfriend is jealous and feels threatened by your relationship with your friend. \nMy apologies if I\u2019ve made an incorrect assumption.", "NTA I am much older than you and I have done that solely to help the person get benefits from their card. The more they spend, the more benefits they get. I am NOT sure if this is what is going on with Nico, but the more he spends( and pays back on time) the higher his credit limit goes ( usually the case) As someone who waited way too long to get credit established, I would still recommend you look into getting your own cards.", "NTA\n\nDoes his girlfriend know you pay every cent he paid on your behalf back?", "YTA, get your own card with no fees when you use it abroad. There is no reason for y'all to keep doing this. It sounds like you are taking advantage of your friend Nico's generosity even though you normally pay him back after.", "NTA. It\u2019s none of her business. You guys have done this many times before, and Nico trusts that you will always pay him back. She\u2019s making a big stink for no reason.", "NTA\n\nGirlfriend is insecure, talk to Nico about it and more generally about your friendship with respect to her because if there\u2019s a chance she\u2019s blown up about this there is a high chance she blows up about other parts of your friendship too.", "ESH\n\nHer reaction is a little out of proportion, but she's right to question it.\n\nGet your own credit card for traveling. It sounds like you travel often enough that it would be worth it!", "NTA\n\nWhy didn't Nico explained this to her girlfriend? Did he ever expressed his feeling about this way of doing about the paying back? I assume he never had a problem with this method. Unless Nico specifically said I don't like this no more, would you be ok with it then? IMO Nico should have communicated better with his girlfriend.", "NTA. Your friend is afraid of his girlfriend. You had an existing practice and if it was to end the friend should have been the one to end it (before the trip). This shouldn't have come about by a tantrum by the girlfriend.", "NTA\n\nyou have an agreement, one you've used multiiple times seemingly, with Nico..  NICO is finne with it.  it's NICO's card.  his gf's opinion is irrelevant.  as long as YOU ARE paying him back (not just 'normally pay him' but ALWAYS) then who cares", "Eh, at the very least this is weird.  Given both partners' clear uncomfortableness with the arrangement, this seems like it may be a focusing point of other jealous concerns about your closeness to Nico.  Given your odd situation, the jealousy your bf and Nico's gf seem to be feeling is understandable. That said, it sounds like the way they've chosen to communicate their concerns is inappropriate. I also wonder if Nico is over your arrangement, but feels obligated to keep it up because you expect it of him. If you didn't discuss it before this time it may be just you presuming he's cool with it and his gf trying to help him out. Still, he should be able to stand up for himself whether it's you or his gf out of line. Finally, you should be an adult and just pay for yourself. Avoiding the fees if not worth the massive drama it's causing. ESH.", "I was going to say nta because your friend is OK with this situation. And it's really none of the girlfriends business. \n\nBut yta. Because you caused such a fuss that you caused fights and had the group split up during a vacation together.", "NTA. This is a matter between you and your friend Nico, and the rest of them should be ashamed of themselves. I would, however, not want that kind of hassle again, so why not get your own card that doesn't charge fees for using it abroad, assuming you can get one, of course. I am not quite sure, how these things work.", "ESH. It sounds like it was mishandled all around if the vacation blew up over it.\n\nYou say that if he had a problem with it you would use your own card, so I don\u2019t see why you felt you needed to force the issue with his girlfriend and escalate it to ruining the whole vacation. It\u2019s a weird kind of flex. And a dumb hill to kill your friendship with Nico on.\n\nNico could have put his gf in her place if he heard her doing it and hIs failure to do so would be a message to you that you should stop it.  If it was behind his back every single time, you should have taken him aside and said that this was causing an issue so you would use your own card this trip. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal, drama queen. If your friendship with Nico is valuable to you then you keep it by acting in his best interest. It\u2019s not a huge deal for you to pay some fees to make sure everyone has a good trip, including him and his girlfriend. If she\u2019s broadly toxic he\u2019ll dump her anyway eventually. But now everyone\u2019s trip is ruined because two petty people got into a Nico likes me better measuring contest. And you were one of those petty people.\n\nAnd face it, if Nico stayed with her when your group split up, you lost that contest, honey.\n\nAre you male or female?", "NTA\u2014if you and your friend are both on the same page, that\u2019s between you both. \n\nUnless him and his girlfriend are sharing finances, she doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction to blow up on you and should voice her concerns to her boyfriend.", "My guess is Nico wasn't fully comfortable with it but didn't know how to change the dynamic. YTA", "NTA He isn't \"gifting\" you the things you pay for and it might even be a bonus for both of you. No fees for you and he gets more points. Long as you're paying him back both your SOs need to check themselves.", "YTA.\n\nI get that there is a precedent of this but if this is something that makes the gf uncomfortable I just think you should respect that and not try pull rank and turn it into a pissing contest. It\u2019s boundary she wants to establish. Why are you so resistant to that? Can\u2019t you just open an account and sort this out yourself for travelling? It\u2019s not Nico\u2019s responsibility to carry this on forever.", "ESH.   \nShe sucks for being annoyed, I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s jealous, but she\u2019s probably annoyed that everything comes down to when Nico and his credit card is there.   \nNico sucks for not managing the situation.   \nYou suck for not growing up and getting yourself a card that lets you travel free. Which created the situation.   \nIt\u2019s weirdly dependent to have a friend pay for everything on a holiday. What if you want to do different tours? What if you need to split for some reason? Sort yourself out and then there\u2019s no odd dependency.", "YTA for causing friction that is going to inevitably spill over to your friend\u2019s relationship. M\n\nBe a big boy and use your own card.", "NTA. I'm not sure why this turned into such a fight. It does sound like he wasn't completely open or honest about the situation, but it really isn't a big deal if you are always good about paying him back. \n\nIf this is something his girlfriend is uncomfortable with than the two of them need to have a conversation about it between them and than he as your friend needs to address it with you. \n\nIf you guys had this agreement before the trip even started than it sounds like the girlfriend is being jealous or honestly dramatic.", "NTA", "NTA because the girlfriend did this behind Nico's back. You need to talk to Nico directly. That's what she should have done as well. She's being a controlling AH; it's completely Nico's decision.\n\nYour boyfriend is another kettle of fish.\n\nThey're obviously both suspicious of and jealous of the relationship between you and Nico. So be honest with yourselves and them about it. If you're friends, you can still have these kinds of agreements.\n\nHowever, if Nico chooses his girlfriend, you may not see him much anymore after a \"big blow up.\" Sorry. She sounds pretty awful. From what you've said here, you didn't contribute much awfulness here, but of course you might have (making everyone AHs).", "NTA.\n\nIf you are all traveling, I'm going to assume Nico is an adult.  You call her his girlfriend, so I'm guessing they don't have joint finances.  Therefore how he spends his money is on him.  If he is ok paying, and then collecting money from you, that is fine.  When I travel with people, we often rotate who pays for what and just use splitwise after.  But if he is willing to front all the money and you pay him later, that has nothing to do with her.  \n\nWhile you didn't state your gender, I'm betting you are a woman, and she has a problem with him having this kind of friendship with another woman.  I could be wrong, but this sounds like that type of issue, since she thinks its being done behind her back.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They pay for bigger expenses and I pay for the local ones or the prebooked items.
