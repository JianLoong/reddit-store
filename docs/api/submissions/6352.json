Especially since the behavior was a shock to you.  \n\nWhich is why getting her a vehicle maybe to soon.  \n\nPlus calling you AHs about it doesn't help much.  \n\nIt shows she has learned nothing and doesn't deserve the car.  \n\nIf she would have acted like she had some sense and asked, \"what can I do to make this right?\" Accepted parental guidance.

But now, I wouldn't buy her a car until she can act with maturity and respect for the gifts of life, especially those of from family.", "Nta ofc she flipped, she's a 14yo who is having the consequences of her shitty actions.
