Why are you still in contact with her? Why is your dad still with her? Why are you subjecting your kids to that?", "NTA. Your mom could go by herself and the rest of you can do your own Christmas. That is, if you\u2019re prepared to tolerate the tantrum she will undoubtedly throw. Her tantrums sound epic. At the end of the day, they are merely abusive bullying.
