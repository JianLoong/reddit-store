We lost our dad 7 years ago and our mom remarried 5 years ago. We now have three stepsisters who are 10, 8 and 7. They have different moms and their dad has custody of them so they live in the same house as us 100% of the time. We also have a half brother and mom is pregnant with another girl.\n\nMy sister and I see our dad's family still. More now that we are older because we have told mom we want more time with them and have put our foot down on getting more access, because initially after marrying her husband she limited our time with them to a couple of times a year. \n\nThere was a big deal made out of the fact my dad's side of the family do not have a relationship with our step or half siblings and never buy gifts for them or send family gifts home for us when my sister and I see them.\n\nLately, like the last 12 months, mom has been on our case about trying to bridge the gap between our dad's side and the rest of the family. She said their lack of extended family is a problem and we should try to open up our paternal side's hearts to welcoming more people into the family and that it would make us heroes in the eyes of the other kids.\n\nMom actually became estranged from her parents because they refused to have anything to do with my stepsisters and said they were not family and would not be treated like they are part of their family. Mom hates them for that. I find it kind of funny because even when dad was alive she rejected any chance from our dad's side to get close to them. She never really liked them and turned down so many invites from them and then she bitched when they sent her money after dad died to help her out with us and made a huge deal out of them bringing us for fun days out in the weeks after dad died to help us get out of our heads. She said they overstepped even though they had permission to take us places. So to know mom was all bent out of shape about her family, and I get that my stepsisters are kids and all, but mom was basically like that with our cousins who were also kids. So we don't see mom's parents anymore. But my sister and I can contact them.\n\nMy sister and I saw our family the 24th of December and the 26th. 24th was family Christmas. 26th was a bit of a trip to a special place. Mom was really pissed that we went and didn't try to include the other kids. All Christmas Day she was shaming us saying we were being selfish and the days after she was doing the same. We told her to stop. My sister said she shouldn't talk to us that way. Mom was saying how crappy we were being and how we should be doing better. I got so annoyed that I called up her parents and told them on new years day what she had been saying... and then they called to chew her out which pissed her off because she didn't want to hear from them. She said I had no right to do that. I told her she shouldn't shame us then. She said I was being a brat and I was risking my stepsisters feelings.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704644885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190vvxf/aita_for_telling_my_moms_parents_that_she_spent/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mom doesn't talk to her parents because they refused to have anything to do with my stepsisters and maybe it was a asshole thing to call them and bring them into this.

Your dad's family is not your step-siblings family. Your mom needs to let you and your sister spend time with them without the guilt. That's not fair. You need that family time. It's also not your fault that your mom tries to make you include your whole family. You haven't asked to see their side of the family, why should they get pushed on yours. If your mom keeps up the shaming, you may need to ask the grandparents to fight for custody. Your mom is being emotionally abusive. Stay strong, and good luck", "Your mom seems to be a really toxic person, unfortunately you have to put up with her until your 18 when you can go LC or NC with her.  NTA.", "NTA. She knows what she's doing and she's angry that she was called out for it by her parents. Her behaviour towards you and your sister is toxic, abusive and unfair, and good on you for standing up for yourselves and not tolerating it.", "NTA. It's okay to seek support from other family members if you feel it's necessary. Parents should communicate respectfully and not resort to shaming language.", "NTA, you will be an adult very soon, you both can see the family you want and learn from the mistakes of your mother.\n\nMake good choices", "NTA at all, and why is your mom thinking your paternal grandparents should welcome children they have no relation to. If they wanted to welcome the kids, it is up to them. \n\nSomething isn't right with your mom, but it's beyond my ability to diagnose her.", "NTA.\n\nYour Mother is behaving like a child, so it makes total sense that you told her parents what she is doing.  When my Mum would go off the rails about something (usually if I got a B on a report card instead of straight A's and then she'd ground me, tell me she was going to get rid of the dog, take all my fun books and lock me in my room with only school books,  etc) I would run out the door (I was much faster than her) and down the road to my auntie (her older sister). I'd tell aunt Kathy what was happening and she would call their Mom and the other sisters and they would go have words with her and she'd back down.  They were the only ones who could really control her when she went on a tear.\n\nUse what you have at your disposal to curb her behavior.  Keep telling her parents about her behavior.  Sometimes shaming someone for behaving shamefully is needed.", "NTA, just mitigate damage until you guys can get TF out. maybe tell these people whats going on in a way your mom doesn't know?", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA, your mother needs to knock it the hell off before she drives both families away", "ESH you shouldn't have involved your maternal grandparents in this.
