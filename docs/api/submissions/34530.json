We lost our dad 7 years ago and our mom remarried 5 years ago. We now have three stepsisters who are 10, 8 and 7. They have different moms and their dad has custody of them so they live in the same house as us 100% of the time. We also have a half brother and mom is pregnant with another girl.\n\nMy sister and I see our dad's family still. More now that we are older because we have told mom we want more time with them and have put our foot down on getting more access, because initially after marrying her husband she limited our time with them to a couple of times a year. \n\nThere was a big deal made out of the fact my dad's side of the family do not have a relationship with our step or half siblings and never buy gifts for them or send family gifts home for us when my sister and I see them.\n\nLately, like the last 12 months, mom has been on our case about trying to bridge the gap between our dad's side and the rest of the family. She said their lack of extended family is a problem and we should try to open up our paternal side's hearts to welcoming more people into the family and that it would make us heroes in the eyes of the other kids.\n\nMom actually became estranged from her parents because they refused to have anything to do with my stepsisters and said they were not family and would not be treated like they are part of their family. Mom hates them for that. I find it kind of funny because even when dad was alive she rejected any chance from our dad's side to get close to them. She never really liked them and turned down so many invites from them and then she bitched when they sent her money after dad died to help her out with us and made a huge deal out of them bringing us for fun days out in the weeks after dad died to help us get out of our heads. She said they overstepped even though they had permission to take us places. So to know mom was all bent out of shape about her family, and I get that my stepsisters are kids and all, but mom was basically like that with our cousins who were also kids. So we don't see mom's parents anymore. But my sister and I can contact them.\n\nMy sister and I saw our family the 24th of December and the 26th. 24th was family Christmas. 26th was a bit of a trip to a special place. Mom was really pissed that we went and didn't try to include the other kids. All Christmas Day she was shaming us saying we were being selfish and the days after she was doing the same. We told her to stop. My sister said she shouldn't talk to us that way. Mom was saying how crappy we were being and how we should be doing better. I got so annoyed that I called up her parents and told them on new years day what she had been saying... and then they called to chew her out which pissed her off because she didn't want to hear from them. She said I had no right to do that. I told her she shouldn't shame us then. She said I was being a brat and I was risking my stepsisters feelings.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704644885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190vvxf/aita_for_telling_my_moms_parents_that_she_spent/", "score": 575, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad's family is not your step-siblings family. Your mom needs to let you and your sister spend time with them without the guilt. That's not fair. You need that family time. It's also not your fault that your mom tries to make you include your whole family. You haven't asked to see their side of the family, why should they get pushed on yours. If your mom keeps up the shaming, you may need to ask the grandparents to fight for custody. Your mom is being emotionally abusive. Stay strong, and good luck", "Your mom seems to be a really toxic person, unfortunately you have to put up with her until your 18 when you can go LC or NC with her.  NTA.", "NTA. She knows what she's doing and she's angry that she was called out for it by her parents. Her behaviour towards you and your sister is toxic, abusive and unfair, and good on you for standing up for yourselves and not tolerating it.", "NTA. It's okay to seek support from other family members if you feel it's necessary. Parents should communicate respectfully and not resort to shaming language.", "NTA, you will be an adult very soon, you both can see the family you want and learn from the mistakes of your mother.\n\nMake good choices", "NTA at all, and why is your mom thinking your paternal grandparents should welcome children they have no relation to. If they wanted to welcome the kids, it is up to them. \n\nSomething isn't right with your mom, but it's beyond my ability to diagnose her.", "NTA.\n\nYour Mother is behaving like a child, so it makes total sense that you told her parents what she is doing.  When my Mum would go off the rails about something (usually if I got a B on a report card instead of straight A's and then she'd ground me, tell me she was going to get rid of the dog, take all my fun books and lock me in my room with only school books,  etc) I would run out the door (I was much faster than her) and down the road to my auntie (her older sister). I'd tell aunt Kathy what was happening and she would call their Mom and the other sisters and they would go have words with her and she'd back down.  They were the only ones who could really control her when she went on a tear.\n\nUse what you have at your disposal to curb her behavior.  Keep telling her parents about her behavior.  Sometimes shaming someone for behaving shamefully is needed.", "NTA, just mitigate damage until you guys can get TF out. maybe tell these people whats going on in a way your mom doesn't know?", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA, your mother needs to knock it the hell off before she drives both families away", "ESH you shouldn't have involved your maternal grandparents in this.

Every time she wants to open up to shame you, call your grandparents up and let them know what time it is.\n\n>She said I was being a brat and I was risking my stepsisters feelings.\n\nThat's your problem, how? You're NTA, but get ready to be ostracized from your mom over your own independence and her desire to be irresponsible.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss,  and everything you are going through.  Your mom is being very unreasonable,  and unnecessarily taking it out on you and your sister.  Please keep the lines of communication open with trusted family,  sounds like it's going to get worse especially with another baby on the way", "He should tell her that's exactly what will happen.", "NTA\n\n\n\n\nGuess how much contact i had with my step siblings' grandparents on their mothers side....zero, why? Because they were my grandparents.  And they had the exact same amount of contact with my paternal family.\n\n\n\n\nBlending families means the biological families of the two people getting married, not the biological families of their exs. \n\n\n\nThat like asking the parents of someone you dated 5 years ago and dont have kids with to be grandparents to your kids from your current relationship. Who thinks that is rational?", "NTA. Why would your dads family include children that have nothing to do with them. Your mum is crazy to think they should all be included. Your dads family have no obligation to the rest of your mums children\u2019s. It\u2019s not your dads family fault they have no other extended family. Your mum should not be guilt tripping you over something so ridiculous just because she feels guilty that they take you nice places. That\u2019s your family and your chance to spend time with them. Your mum needs to back off and stop pushing something that is never going to happen.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother is out of her depth.  She has NO CLUE how to treat children in a blended family.  She's equally clueless on dealing with her own parents and her deceased husband's family. Who is in the middle of all of this, causing the drama?  None other than your mom.\n\nTell her that the surest way to alienate everybody is to try to force people to do things.  SHE should be trying to figure out fun outings for all of you, instead of trying to force you to include your step-siblings with YOUR biological family.  She's being pretty entitled there.", "NTA. \n\nConstantly trying to guilt you into 'begging' for gifts for your step sisters and half siblings from your dad's family is pathetic to say the least. Let's face it, what she wants you to do is beg on her behalf from people she is not even related to. Imagine the entitlement it takes.\n\nMaybe check if someone from your dad's side is interested in pursuing your custody and involve child protective services to report harassment from your mom, so you can get rid of your mom and her toxicity from your life. It's far fetched but worth a try rather than put up with her toxicity till you are of age.", "She sounds like she's bent out of shape because you and your sister are getting more gifts than the steps and the new babies are getting because your paternal grandparents make sure to take care of you. The only ones in that group who are their blood kin are you two. They owe nothing to anyone else. NTA.", "NTA, adult problems are adult problems... That\u2019s your dad, his family has nothing to do with what your mom is doing now\u2026 they\u2019re not obligated those kids are not your dads kids they\u2019re not their family. You and your sister are, they know you, they don\u2019t know those kids\u2026 she\u2019s putting her issues on you guys and forcing you guys to be involved and help her navigate through it, it\u2019s not your job. The unnecessary comments and trying to get you to include the other kids is weird especially with a family that doesn\u2019t know them or have any connection or relationship. Your mom may want something but she can\u2019t control people to do what she wants\u2026 good on you and your sister for standing your ground and keep your family updated on your moms bs. I hope you\u2019re enjoying your New Year despite the rocky start.", "NTA. You and your sister are kids who dealt with a tragic loss. Your mom seems more focused on making her step kids feel included rather than helping you two heal. I would\u2019ve done the same thing, calling her parents. She is being immature and needed to be scolded for it by her own parents. So sorry you both have to go through this.", "NTA.  Your mom sounds a little mentally ill to be honest.  Try and realize that it is likely something like that which is doing the talking and not take it personally or internalize it.  You're doing sensible things.", "NTA", "NTA AT ALL!!!!!!!", "Of course you are NTA in any way.  \nYour mother is horrible, she's a major AH. I don't understand how parents think that forcing kids into relationships is going to work. Has it every resulted it a strong bond between/among the kids in a \"blended\" family? All I have seen is resentment and sometimes pure hate.  \nAny chance you and your sister can spent more time including some nights with your grandparents?  \nYou really don't need to deal with her BS.", "NTA!\n\nYour mother is, however, and I feel for the new child being brought into the chaotic dynamic.", "NTA but you were born of one.", "No you're not.", "NTA. Never the a-hole if you want to spend time with your own family. No matter how your mom spins it. If she doesn't understand, unfortunately that is her mental hurdle to overcome. You and your sister should keep in close contact with family that wants you in their lives! I've grown up with family members that never gave me the time of day, so I would feel remiss if I didn't say how important it is to maintain relationships with people who do want you in their lives.", "Wait till you 18 and go no contact like the rest of us with shitty parents", "You\u2019re NTA. none of this is your problem.", "All I want to say is that you're absolutely amazing. NTA.", "NTA.   This is all adult business and not yours.   Your Mom should not be using you as the go between/peace maker.", "NTA. I wish your sister and you the best, and I hope you're able to get out of your mother's house as soon as you're old enough to do so.", "nta.", "Your mom is a user \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\ndo you and your sister do things with your step-siblings moms and their families? just wondering as this would also be something your mom is fighting for but I bet that never occurred to her.", "LMAOOO I said the same thing before I read the comments. Like I was so mad I was typing and reading as I went. Let the kids be kids if you\u2019re so worried about the other siblings being included go bring your family into it. Stop forcing others to compensate where you lack and forcing an expectation on others\u2026 like she\u2019s weird.", "Agree  1000%", "TBH, I lost track of how many kids there are. OP, it sounds like your mom and stepdad are the kind of people who view kids and grandparents as interchangeable NPCs and reconfigure them depending on whoever their sleeping with. I'm so sorry that you're dealing with this, and hope you and your sibs can hold it together until you're adults and then avoid this whole mess.", "Please actually read the first couple sentences of OP\u2019s post.
