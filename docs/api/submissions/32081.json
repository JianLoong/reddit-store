He then took my phone out of the kitchen to show other managers what I\u2019d written ( I had no idea he even had my phone at this point). He then comes in and puts my phone back, and calls me round to ask me why i hadn\u2019t come to him with these issues and I should have directly discussed it with him. (I haven\u2019t gone to him with these issues and I have had many issues with him in the past and told him for nothing to happen.) I told him he had no respect and should never have gotten my phone in the first place to which he says \u2018it was unlocked and he saw his name\u2019 before leaving the kitchen.

It wasn't cool for John to pick up your personal device and whatnot, but you did write ABOUT him and leave it unlocked. It's a lot to ask of someone to see that they are being referenced in notes and ignore it. Live and learn - you need to lock your phone obviously. In terms of his critique of you, I think you should just say you have previously talked to him about your concerns, and these were notes you had collected for yourself in preparation for a mtg with the area manager. Not much more that you can say.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was no Data breach in HIS actions, he read an openly visible notice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU are the problem, you left your device unlocked - very likely in disregard of policies.
