I\u2019m getting to know his girlfriend of two years Ann well too. \n\nHere's the problem, the two couples often double date, and if you ask me I think they like each other, and are two steps away from doing the whole polyamory thing. Of course that\u2019s just my guess. I don\u2019t have a problem with this, except for when I hang out with all of them I\u2019m made to feel like the fifth wheel.\n\nYou should also know I'm criminally single.\n\nA few weeks before The Fourth of July, Kev and Sarah asked if I wanted to go with all of them to a lakehouse over the long weekend. They promised I wouldn\u2019t feel left out. We even planned some stuff to do in groups. I wasn\u2019t totally convinced, but I said fine I needed some time away anyway.\n\nWell we get there, and immediately I notice that things are going to happen just like they always do. To make a long story short, almost none of the planned activities happened as intended. I was supposed to go fishing with the Kev and Mike but they did a morning couples hike while I was sleeping and told me they were too tired to go fishing. I wanted some \u201cgirl time\u201d with Sarah and Ann to go bird watching, but that never happened. Meanwhile I was roped into doing stuff they wanted to do and I was mostly ignored. Kev did try to involve me somewhat, but it felt more like a pity thing.\n\nIt got so bad that I drove to the closest mall to get away for a few hours. Sarah called to ask if I was okay and I told her that I wasn\u2019t because I was feeling like the fifth wheel. She apologized and said to come back. That night we did a Friday the 13th marathon as an apology, but no one else was into it. They were just talking to each other. I stopped after the second movie and went to sleep.\n\nThe next day everyone asked if I was okay, I again said no. My worst fear happened after being assured that it wouldn\u2019t. They told me they were just going with the flow and that it wasn't intentional. I said I\u2019m fine with doing my own thing provided I had some time to really hang with everyone. Then Ann drove me over the edge. She said: \u201cmaybe you wouldn\u2019t be so mad if you had a girlfriend, jealousy isn\u2019t attractive\u201d. I wish I had some clever response, but I said if that\u2019s how you feel then I\u2019m out. They tried to stop me, but I told them it was best that I left. I drove Mike and Ann so I asked Sarah and Kevin to give them a ride back and left.\n\nIn haven\u2019t talked to any of them really since only to tell them all I got home safe. Truth be told I mostly calmed down on the way back home.\n\n In the weeks since, I kinda feel like maybe I overreacted. Maybe I am jealous and it ruined what could have been a good weekend.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for leaving my trip early because I felt like I was the unwanted fifth wheel?", "created_utc": 1689797725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1545n2d/aita_for_leaving_a_trip_early_because_i_was_made/", "score": 491, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I try to find friends who are more relaxed and easy going and don\u2019t make me feel like a 3rd wheel.\n\nI would also note that sometimes it seems like these couples are the ones who I have an equally close friendship with their spouse too.  If I know their wife or husband equally as well then I find it feels more like a circle and less like a pair Vs a third wheel.  It feels like there\u2019s less reason for the couple to disclude me from a conversation or activity if all 3 (or 5) of us have just as much in common and reason to socialize together and less of a reason to interact with their spouse more than the \u201cstranger\u201d they don\u2019t know as well.

They gave you promises of ways they'd include you. So you had expectations. Then, they proceeded to cancel every plan. When you communicated, they made more empty promises. I'd nope out of all of that, too.

This is why I hesitated to join you four on this trip. I was certain that I\u2019d be left out while you four did your thing, but I was assured that wouldn\u2019t be the case, so I joined. But I was right. Instead of accommodating me, y\u2019all left me alone to do what you four wanted. Plans made with me were cancelled in favour of your own plans, MULTIPLE TIMES.

Good luck, OP! :)", "NTA when I was single and I was part of a group where everyone slowly got in relationships and started including their partners and doing this, I HATED IT.

Very unfortunate situation that kind of happened like you were afraid it would, so that's partly on you (although you did communicate), but Ann's comment was really rude. I would've had trouble not bitching back at her. I doubt they'll change though. You're NTA but you should avoid getting into a situation like that in the future. Ann's comment seems like an insight into the way stuff works for her (and maybe them), with how much weight being in a relationship has for them, which obviously outranks friendships, and always will. Sorry about that", "NTA ive been the perpetually single friend and even though I was very smitten single couples still had a way of making me feel like i dont fit in. Id rather do my own thing, i then found i like holidaying alone or with groups of strangers instead of waiting for the majority to want to do what i want.\n\nId have left too as they were rude. But they probably just dont understand that youre really not jealous", "NTA\n\nIt didn't really sound like jealousy to me", "NTA. Your friends are quite immature.", "Sarah and kevin needed you for the ride. NtA.", "NTA. F*ck them! They were clearly purposefully ignoring you then gaslighted you while playing victim. \n\nYou deserve better than manipulation. I'd delete their numbers and other contact info and move on with a happy gaslight free life.", "YTA ESH, however I understand.  Just cool down and apologize after a bit.  Put the odis of forgiveness on them and it'll probably come", "NTA.  As soon as you left they got out the lube and laughed hard about you.", "These people are not your friends. I'm the single one in my friend group & I'm never left out. I go on holiday with at least 2 of the couples every year & I'm the one encouraging them to go off & do couple stuff & telling them they don't have to include me in everything.", "NTA. They all suck, but man Ann sounds like a swear word.", "NTA.  \n\n\nI'm criminally single too and had \"couple friends\" who did this. But I also had friends who didn't. It's a huge difference. The right people will include you, no matter what you are doing and will never make it feel like pity. The right people will always treat a friend well, single or not.  \nFrankly if the 4 of them are really that close they should either 1. not have invited you and have their orgy 2. if they invited you they should have sticked to the plans and activities including you, too.  \n\n\nAlso, the whole \"you wouldn't be so mad if you had a girlfriend\" thing is really immature. Because \"going with the flow\" also means you notice that your friend is feeling bummed out and take it back a notch.", "Not really, I also are in a close group of friends where we are 3 couples and 1 single. Never have we ever planned something and left the one without a partner put, it's just plain rude. She is right to be mad and also that Ann sounds like a piece of work. \n\n NTA. Find better friends.", "Or maybe just call it a day with these four and hang out with friends you have more in common with.", "Id have left too as they were rude. But they probably just don't understand that you're really not jealous", "> I'd delete their numbers and other contact info and move on with a happy gaslight free life."]}
