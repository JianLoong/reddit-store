I\u2019m getting to know his girlfriend of two years Ann well too. \n\nHere's the problem, the two couples often double date, and if you ask me I think they like each other, and are two steps away from doing the whole polyamory thing. Of course that\u2019s just my guess. I don\u2019t have a problem with this, except for when I hang out with all of them I\u2019m made to feel like the fifth wheel.\n\nYou should also know I'm criminally single.\n\nA few weeks before The Fourth of July, Kev and Sarah asked if I wanted to go with all of them to a lakehouse over the long weekend. They promised I wouldn\u2019t feel left out. We even planned some stuff to do in groups. I wasn\u2019t totally convinced, but I said fine I needed some time away anyway.\n\nWell we get there, and immediately I notice that things are going to happen just like they always do. To make a long story short, almost none of the planned activities happened as intended. I was supposed to go fishing with the Kev and Mike but they did a morning couples hike while I was sleeping and told me they were too tired to go fishing. I wanted some \u201cgirl time\u201d with Sarah and Ann to go bird watching, but that never happened. Meanwhile I was roped into doing stuff they wanted to do and I was mostly ignored. Kev did try to involve me somewhat, but it felt more like a pity thing.\n\nIt got so bad that I drove to the closest mall to get away for a few hours. Sarah called to ask if I was okay and I told her that I wasn\u2019t because I was feeling like the fifth wheel. She apologized and said to come back. That night we did a Friday the 13th marathon as an apology, but no one else was into it. They were just talking to each other. I stopped after the second movie and went to sleep.\n\nThe next day everyone asked if I was okay, I again said no. My worst fear happened after being assured that it wouldn\u2019t. They told me they were just going with the flow and that it wasn't intentional. I said I\u2019m fine with doing my own thing provided I had some time to really hang with everyone. Then Ann drove me over the edge. She said: \u201cmaybe you wouldn\u2019t be so mad if you had a girlfriend, jealousy isn\u2019t attractive\u201d. I wish I had some clever response, but I said if that\u2019s how you feel then I\u2019m out. They tried to stop me, but I told them it was best that I left. I drove Mike and Ann so I asked Sarah and Kevin to give them a ride back and left.\n\nIn haven\u2019t talked to any of them really since only to tell them all I got home safe. Truth be told I mostly calmed down on the way back home.\n\n In the weeks since, I kinda feel like maybe I overreacted. Maybe I am jealous and it ruined what could have been a good weekend.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for leaving my trip early because I felt like I was the unwanted fifth wheel?", "created_utc": 1689797725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1545n2d/aita_for_leaving_a_trip_early_because_i_was_made/", "score": 247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I actually live 1000+ miles away from everyone I know and, thus, do 99% of everything solo. It's great. Often I meet new friends or \"friends for the afternoon\" who I'll never see again.

Could you have gone if you were awake? \n\nWhy do you think Kev\u2019s efforts to involve you were pity?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you do any activities that all 5 of you enjoy? They weren\u2019t into the movies. The girls don\u2019t go fishing. The guys don\u2019t go bird watching. You were roped into activities they wanted to do.

And other times I\u2019ve felt excluded and it was because I was actually being excluded. You write a lot about how you felt and not much about specific actions so it\u2019s difficult to tell which is the situation here.", "Nta. But if you chose to keep hanging out with them just learn to do things alone. No one wants to bird watch? Cool bye you go and enjoy yourself, maybe with some headphones and a snack. They don\u2019t want to go fishing? Do it by the dock, safely. Go on walks yourself. It\u2019s frustrating to be the fifth wheel but if you CHOOSE to be with them then that may be your only option.", "NTA\n\nAs I have gotten older (43 soon) and my lifestyle differences between myself and married friends with kids have become more and more apparent I\u2019ve learned to seek prioritize spending time with friends who \u201cdon\u2019t act like married couples with kids\u201d if I find such people in my circle of friends.  I try to find friends who are more relaxed and easy going and don\u2019t make me feel like a 3rd wheel.\n\nI would also note that sometimes it seems like these couples are the ones who I have an equally close friendship with their spouse too.  If I know their wife or husband equally as well then I find it feels more like a circle and less like a pair Vs a third wheel.  It feels like there\u2019s less reason for the couple to disclude me from a conversation or activity if all 3 (or 5) of us have just as much in common and reason to socialize together and less of a reason to interact with their spouse more than the \u201cstranger\u201d they don\u2019t know as well.  Conversation doesn\u2019t slow to a trickle or get awkward if I know them just as much as the person they married and we\u2019re not struggling to relate to each other when their SO steps out of the room.", "The problem here is expectation. They gave you promises of ways they'd include you. So you had expectations. Then, they proceeded to cancel every plan. When you communicated, they made more empty promises. I'd nope out of all of that, too. You are NTA, and I would never 5th wheel with them again.", "NTA they invited you, promised you wouldn't feel left out, and the promptly left you out of everything, and then insulated you.  \nTime for some new friends.  Maybe you hang out with some of them individually, if they apologize, but not with the two couples again.  And definitely look into some groups or something in your area, hopefully you can find some others interested in what you want to do.", "Her husband didn't do childcare...I guarantee she is having a much more miserable life than you, if it's any consolation.", "Tbh for all you know, they already could be swapping. The older I get and the more people I meet, the more obvious shit like that gets. Plenty of people do such things and most don't go around telling everyone.\n\nIf your gut says they're all basically dating each other, you might not be far off.", "I feel you! I enjoy my alone time and it\u2019s pretty awesome doing what I want when I want. I do like hanging with friends but relish alone time too.", "NTA for leaving a situation you weren\u2019t enjoying. \n\nAnn sounds like an AH for her. \n\nI\u2019m a little put off by you \u201ccriminally single\u201d comment and I wonder if there more to this story (or your past relationship with these people) than you shared with us.", "Nta", "I feel like you would get along great with my cousin and me \ud83d\ude02 NTA", "NTA- not going to repeat others, just get new friends.\n\nAnn and Mike sounds like the larger issue, if they have a following out Kevin and Sarah may try to come back to you, I\u2019d remember though they chose Ann and Mike over you the first time and would do it again.  \n\nDon\u2019t subsidize their trips", "I\u2019d also it could be to lower the cost and get an additional driver\u2026", "<<I guess it's the unimportant ones job to contact the important one.>> So much yes, they believe this.
