Kids get dirty. Kids have accidents. Kids very often need a clothes change. \n\nI will advise you to do what she does. She has her parents sign a document that says they understand that due to activities that stimulate the brain, accidents, and the nature of outside play, clothes will get dirty and stained.  This document says my mom cannot be held responsible for the value of the ruined clothing. It also says the parents will provide clothes appropriate for activities conducted in a child care environment and that she can deny drop off if the child\u2019s clothes are not suitable for play. \n\nIt also outlines that the parents give my mom permission to change clothes as necessary or they can sign to opt out, she can call the parents when clothe changes are required to come to the daycare within  X amount of minutes to do it themselves or she can without repercussion. \n\nJust an idea. Up to you if it works for your business or not", "NTA\u2014 you explained your program.

Either the clothes get dirty, or she wears different clothes. Those are realistically the only two outcomes, and it's very generous of you to provide appropriate clothing. If the mom doesn't like it, she can find clothes that *can* get dirty which are still acceptable to her, or she can find a different childcare option.

So either she needs to deal with it or be okay with the clothes she picks being trashed and not complain/blame you. The kiddos Dad also gave you the thumbs up and he is also the girl's parent.\n\nI think it is an uncomfortable situation to think about someone else dressing your children, which is probably why your husband is where his is at, particularly not knowing.... But I think there are appropriate times to do so in child care. No kid wants to be stuck in their pee pants all day for example...", "ESH. Cindy much more, she sounds infuriating.

This parent actually brought play clothes for her son but expected me to change him back into good clothes when we weren\u2019t going outside or doing messy art projects. I just changed him into his play clothes and left them on all day. She would usually pick him up around outside time anyway and if she showed up unexpectedly, I would just make an excuse and offer to change his clothes for her. Because here\u2019s the thing:\n\nAin\u2019t nobody got time for that.\n\nBreanne is not the only child you have in your care. Your priority is the safety and happiness of all the children. You don\u2019t have the time, the eye balls, the arms,or mental capacity to worry about one child getting dirty. And I would tell that to Cindy next time she complains. Children are supposed to get dirty at daycare. It\u2019s how you know they had fun. \n\nAlso, not you, not the other children in your care, and probably not the other parents, give a flying crap that her kid is dressed like designer doll. It\u2019s not a beauty contest.", "NTA.

She just didn\u2019t like your solution. Ask her if you\u2019d rather she be excluded from painting or playing outside and instead be given princess activities since she\u2019s obviously a princess. Maybe while others paint she can play tea party. Or make a princess castle out of paper. And while others run along in the dirt, she can ride in a pretend carriage. Maybe you can find some cheap 2nd hand princess dresses that you don\u2019t mind getting dirty to put overtop of her dresses. And get those plastic booties to put over her dress shoes.", "ESH. Totally understandable what you did -but- you're intentionally trying to hide something from the parent and that's not good. Parents already worry about their kids being in someone else's care - the last thing they need is to feel like  the care providers are hiding things about what goes on.\n\nBest to let the parent learn their mistakes by ending up with dirty/torn designer clothes.

You cannot cater your curriculum to one kid\u2019s outfits. The mom needs to accept your solution or accept her kids clothes will be dirty.

She\u2019s not happy if her clothes are dirty (kids will always get dirty), she\u2019s not happy if you put her in clothes that are fine to get dirty. She wants her child to not only wear these stupid ass clothes, but expects her not to act like a toddler in them.  Clearly her expectations of you and her own child do not match with the kind of daycare you run.", "NTA for all the reasons. The only thing that is a bit iffy to me is the fact that you didn't mention it at all to the parents before you did it. \n\nNo matter how good your intentions are (and I would've done the exact same if i was wearing your shoes, especially if the kid is not comfortable playing outside, that's just plain sad), it's always a good idea to at least mention what you're doing to the parents beforehand. This way, they don't have to  \"find out\" at the end of the week and feel betrayed I guess.", ">She told me it was my job to figure it out.\n\n\nNTA. She told you to figure it out and you did. Good job!", "NTA at all, but you have your answer. Leave Breanne in the inappropriate clothes. And don\u2019t worry about them being ruined. \n\nI\u2019m not saying to go out of your way to ruin them, just keep putting bibs and smocks on her, and if they get dirty, reinforce to whoever picks her up that it\u2019s why she needs to wear appropriate clothing like the other children.", "So, this mom doesn\u2019t want the pretty clothes getting dirty but won\u2019t put her in play clothes and won\u2019t let you change her into play clothes? I\u2019d say it\u2019s time you put the onus on her to 1.) stop getting mad clothes get dirty, 2.) put the child in proper play clothes, or 3.) find a new daycare because it\u2019s awfully clear there is a disconnect in expectations on both sides. The child is not a doll and she should become the rope in this power struggle/tug of war. \n\nI really don\u2019t know how to answer this because it should be a N T A but also, you shouldn\u2019t be putting kids in clothing not provided for them (if the kid has an allergic reaction to detergent used on that donated clothing, etc. that could be a liability so in that case a bit of E S H)", "NTA\n\nBreanne is 1.5 years old, so she doesn't care about her outfits. \n\nI don't understand why Cindy is upset that you protected her clothes from getting so dirty. When her daughter comes home, Cindy would have to constantly change her outfits, which would be annoying.\n\nAdditionally, you were upfront about these issues from the beginning. So, it's not like you decide to change every toddler's clothes because you feel like it.", "The woman is just a whole lot of trouble you don\u2019t need.", "YTA. Your intentions may have been noble, but you crossed a line. If you wanted to change a child\u2019s clothes you need their parents consent. I would pull my kid from your care if it were me.", "NTA.

Glad you have one realistic parent to deal with.", "NTA at all \n\nOne childcare worker to another, you know that\u2019s what had to be done. Mommy playing dress up with her little girl is all good a fine, until it inhibits that little girl from being able to live her life and be a normal toddler.

It takes all kinds. \n\nOp NTA if i had options I would of had lots change, unfortunately at our school gym cloths were only for grade 3 and up, due to kids taking up all of class changing and it's all in the booklets we sent home.", "I read those books back in the 90s and while it is not to that extreme...it's pretty close.

(If the parents knew it was happening, they wouldn't have been surprised by the photos) The OP literally says this \"I didn't tell Cindy what I was doing\"", "Taking care of small children is hectic enough - this shouldn't be an added issue you have to focus on. You've made it clear - appropriate footwear and clothing that kids can safely run in, climb in etc. Not party dresses and dainty shoes at 18 months old. If she wants designer clothing and footwear, that's fine as long as it's appropriate for the environment and the activities she'll be engaging in and the mom is fine with having those items dirty, stained and/or potentially damaged. If not, it might be easier to tell her to move onto a different provider.", "Ok. If you truly feel that her footwear is inappropriate then change that. Leave the rest of the stuff on. Her mom gets to dress her how she wants.  What\u2019s wrong with her footwear? She\u2019s not wearing tennis shoes?", "Thanks for your input. OP says that she is allowed to change the clothes. Still, I told her to leave the clothes on except maybe the shoes. I somewhat suspect that this is a clash of egos.", "You (and mom) may not know of an allergy until it happens.

That doesn\u2019t mean your luck won\u2019t run out either. \n\nAgain, I stress giving mom (and dad) the three options and a reasonable amount of time to decide what choice they pick. Yes you are in your right to change the child (hence diaper changes/outfit changes with blowouts, etc.). But you are pushing the boundary by introducing things (detergents, fragrances, etc.) that may or may not be known to the child. \n\nThat happened with my oldest (granted my oldest was 4 months old and being given foods and actual juice boxes despite our demands that it stop AND providing 12-20 oz of breast milk for 3-4 hours of care).", "That's awesome that you have that!!\n\nThen I'd say that child is going to have an awesome time and you get to smile and wave...\n\nJust smile and wave.\n\nChildren remember people like you in their lives - especially if a parent is more interested in having a living doll than a human fresh to the world!!", "The mother told OP to figure it out and she did. That definitely doesn't make her an AH.", "She has to reclaim the play clothes, though. If she let the toddler go home in them, she'd never get them back.", "I guess I don't consider that hiding it, so long as they didn't lie about it. Some things I'd consider lie by omission, but not this as they didn't ask...AND the mom *told her* to *figure it out.* That, IMO, is just figuring it out.", "She's wearing Mary Janes.", "It sounds to me like OP is just keeping the clothes clean, as the mother requested, but also doing what's in the child's best interest. Babies and toddlers need clothes that are easy to move and explore in to get the best out of experiences and work on their motor skills. I understand that it's the mother's right to dress her as a doll, even if that is so sad for that child, but if the clothes can't get dirty then it's unreasonable and OP was left with no good option. She can't neglect the child and not let her do anything that everyone else gets to do. I don't see where ego comes into it at all.", "The child isn't allergic to the detergent. Again, I have been using it since she started on her sheets. I show the parents what I use when they start and the mom said it's the same that \\*she\\* uses. So, there's no issue there. I also made sure and all the fabrics I have put her in, are ones found in the clothes that mom puts her in.\n\nWhat youa re talking about is wildly different. And I hope you reported that daycare. That's neglect and abuse.", "The mom told her to \"figure it out\" as in \"figure out how to keep my kid clean\" - that's why the mom continued to send her in designer clothing and continued to get upset when the kid got the clothes dirty. \n\nThat is NOT consent to change a parental decision, which is also why the mom said that no consent was given for this exact thing.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the parental decision is stupid or if the provider *thinks* it doesn't matter. If a parent made a decision about something, then the provider needs explicit consent to override that decision.", "That's not the problem. The problem is she let the parents think that their child was in the original designer clothes all day. She intentionally did not tell the parents she was re-dressing their kid every day.\n\nThis would be a non-issue if she got the parents' consent. To put it another way - if a parent made a specific decision about their child - what the kid eats, wears, etc..., then a daycare provider needs consent to override that parental decision.", "The mom clearly cares a lot about the clothes because she kept making the intentional decision to dress her daughter like that, even when it wasn't appropriate for daycare play. She demonstrated this with her decisions and her freakouts.\n\nOP didn't tell the mom because she knew the mom wasn't being reasonable. She knew it would be a big deal to the mom who was clearly investing a lot into designer clothes. She just wanted to avoid the mom saying no.\n\nThere WAS a right way to do this. OP should have just told the mom that Breanne couldn't come to the daycare unless she was dressed in play-inappropriate clothing or else she could be permitted to change Breanne into normal clothing.", "What\u2019s wrong with those?", "Mother requested that the child wear the clothes that she was sent to school with. The child does not have to be left out of any activities.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to call it if the OP is going out of her way to change the child into different clothes when that is not necessary. Again, I do understand the shoes if they are harmful to the feet.", "Ok. You keep changing her into clothes the parents don\u2019t provide. I mean it\u2019s your option. I\u2019m telling you the professional choices but it\u2019s your life and your choice. Keep engaging in the power struggle with the mom *just* like you\u2019re doing here by arguing how *right* you are. Have fun continuing to fight with the mom.", "Putting the burden on the provider to magically make a 1.5 year old stay clean is ridiculous. I have a 1.5 year old and they do NOT follow instruction. If OP was a nanny (she isn\u2019t) it would be one thing and she could design a whole curriculum to prioritize\u2026 clothes? But she has other kids to assist and can\u2019t cater activities to just one kid.", "I'm not saying that you're wrong, and I am sure that the parent does feel that way, but there wasn't going to be a way that could happen. If the parent is not going to be smarter to not dress the child in a way where she has on things that are okay to get dirty, OP had to do something. I can bet that if OP had decided to just not let the child paint or play outside and took pictures of her sitting to the side while those activities happened, that would have caused trouble as well. \n\nThank you for sharing your POV.", "For one, a toddler cannot run and properly play in them all day, every day. They don't have the proper support or traction. Again, shoes like this are meant for holiday cards or special events. Not every day.\n\nFor two, they're cute and all, but they're getting dirty when we go outside. Which \\*I\\* don't care about, but her mother does.", "When I was 4 I knocked my teeth out because I fell from running around while wearing Mary Jane\u2019s. I was with a babysitter at the time. The poor lady was so distraught. My parents were nice about it but something tells me this lady wouldn\u2019t hesitate to blame OP and sue.", "Yes it IS absolutely ridiculous. There is no argument that the mom is an AH for multiple things, including ridiculous demands. I have two young kids myself, so I know how messy they can be.\n\nThe point is simply about getting consent to change a parent's very clear decision about what they wanted their kid to wear. It doesn't matter how ridiculous the mom is - she is still the parent and the parent gets to decide what they want their kid to wear. Period.\n\nOP bypassed consent because she thought it \"wouldn't be a big deal\" which it *obviously* would be, given Cindy's fixation on fancy clothes. In reality, she simply disagreed with the parental choice and changed it without letting them know. And that makes her an AH, too.\n\nBy the way, consent extends to every parental decision. One of my kids loves Cheerios but we found out over time that he has a really bad reaction to them for some reason. At school, we found out that the teacher was sometimes just giving out Cheerios as snacks (we provided snacks that he was okay with, so they were skipping over the snacks we provided and they never asked for consent).\n\nThis would never have been an issue if OP had informed the parents and required consent as a condition for Breanne going to that daycare (which would be a perfectly legitimate requirement).", "Care providers get consent for all sorts of things. It's a pretty normal way that things work. Some consent is required (e.g. your child must wear play-inappropriate clothing in order to attend the daycare). This is what the OP should have done. Parents will consent to a lot of stuff if it means they can use the service.\n\nOP was trying to bypass that process and act as the parent.", "They also hurt and leave blisters if you wear them for too long. I was a snazzy child by choice and even then I never left the Mary Janes on for more than an hour or two because they just *hurt*", "I\u2019m only agree with you for the first reason. If the shoes are harming the child, then you should change them. But you shouldn\u2019t change the rest of the clothes. You have no right.  \n\nMom would have to be a moron to complain about dirty clothes when she\u2019s not providing different ones and doesn\u2019t want you to change the child. So just ignore her complaints.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s a dickish to dress the child contrary to what the parent wishes. Again, I only justify the shoes because that\u2019s harming the child.", "In all fairness, you could fall and knock your teeth oit wearing any type of shoe. And yes, if a child is injured at a daycare, the parent is going to sue. \n\nAnother poster shared that she used to get blisters from wearing hers. I think that\u2019s a pretty compelling reason to change into more comfortable shoes.", "That is important info. Thank you.", "NTA.  \n\nGive the family notice(whatever is in your contract).  This isn\u2019t going to get better, or it would have already. Or it will turn to something else.  The wrong kind of crackers\u2026not approving of the weather.  Not liking the nap time routine. On &on\n\nCut your losses with them & find a new family.  They need a nanny, not a daycare.  Give them the \u201copportunity\u201d to find a better provider.  It\u2019s ok, not all families fit with home daycare.\n\nIn the meantime, the child is not coming \u201cready for the day\u201d.  This is when I would not accept them into care until I had appropriate shoes. It will only happen once, either they will go home quick (with the child) and come back with usable shoes, or the won\u2019t come back at all.  Whatever, problem solved. I was a home daycare provider for a very, very long time.  I am flexible with a lot of things, but not safety. Fancy slip on shoes are a hazard for play. I was very strict on having gym shoes for the kids.", "She told you it was your job to figure it out and that\u2019s what you did. Too bad she doesn\u2019t like the solution. That poor kid is going to have a tough time when she gets older and is terrified of getting dirty because of her mom\u2019s reaction. Ugh. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou figured it out. That\u2019s just compliance right there.", "NTA. I'm guessing that a. this is her first kid and she's never really spent that much time around kids before or b. Mom has some VERY gendered ideas about how little boys and little girls play.", "NTA. I literally have a parent like this in my class. Dresses the girl in gold jewelry and designer dresses and then gets pissed when she gets dirty.", "NTA\n\nShe told you to figure it out and you did.", "NTA I did the exact same thing when I worked in a daycare. Like others have said, it may be in your best interest to have Cindy look elsewhere. You don't need someone like that in your environment.", "NTA good luck to Cindy finding alternative childcare options!", "NTA\n\nSomeone needs to explain to this woman that kids are neither dolls nor fashion accessories. They get filthy in play and should be dressed for that.\n\nThe notion that parents have a right to simultaneously demand their kids get to participate, wear impractical clothing and never be changed is mind-bending wishful thinking.", "NTA. You told her the clothes would get dirty and she both didn't want to send her in different clothes and didn't want to accept that the clothes would get dirty. She told you to figure it out and you did.", "NTA. My daughter is in third grade and has gone to two different (public) elementary schools and preschool before that. They have always told us that tennis shoes and appropriate clothes are mandatory. I think you went about this in the best way possible- you tried to explain to her first why it\u2019s important she dresses for playing and getting a little messy. Also if I happened to send my daughter to school in something nice on a messy day, I would have been so grateful for the teacher to keep the clothes nice and put her in something different- that is above and beyond.", "NTA\n\nIf she tried this at a daycare centre they would refuse to take the kid. Or take them and tell them to wear proper clothes tomorrow", "NTA. I did daycare for a long time. You sound like a wonderful provider and could most likely fill the spot fast if you asked her to leave. She should be thankful to have someone who does activities with her daughter rather than put her in front of a TV all day like some providers do.she seems like the type of person that just needs something to complain about. If it's not this, it would be something else.", "Depends if she\u2019s potty trained or not for me. If she isn\u2019t than she\u2019ll have to be undressed for diaper changes so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re seeing anything new but I would absolutely lose my sh*t if a worker took my child\u2019s clothes off and was hiding it from me\u2026that is just asking for an inappropriate conduct lawsuit to be filed or sexual abuse allegations to be made. Don\u2019t put yourself in that position inform all the parents that you\u2019ll be instituting a new dress code and if mom fails to comply she will no longer be allowed to attend.", "NTA. My toddler comes home from daycare in completely different outfits from when I drop her off in the morning. And that's okay! Babies and toddlers get dirty all the time. It's expected that they will change clothes.", "NTA.\n\nGod, I feel bad for that child.", "NTA", "As a daycare worker/preschool teacher this is one of my biggest pet peeves! In my classrooms now I have a big poster that says - if I come home a little messy that means I\u2019m learning! At this young age kids learn so much through play and inevitably they will have evidence of that on their clothes. We do the best we can to mitigate that, but you know your child is at a good school if they use paint/sensory materials/ play outside, etc. We\u2019d use smocks, bibs, keep hands and faces clean, and noses wiped, but accidents still happened. \n\nOne year I had a mom completely lose her sh*t at me because she\u2019d dress her 2yo like you\u2019re describing, but I stood my ground and luckily my director had my back. Either deal with it, dress your child appropriately, or you may need to find a new place for your child if this is such an issue. (Honestly if you\u2019re more worried about dressing your kids in designer clothes and keeping them pristine than them learning and having fun, you are doing your child a disservice)\n\nNTA and I sympathize. Whenever I got a new family touring I\u2019d make it very clear with their parents at the first  meeting what our class/school would be like.", "NTA: I have a 4 year old girl, my aim is comfort better than looking cute all the time. I\u2019ll put dresses for appropriate events. But wearing dresses and looking cute shouldn\u2019t be all a girl is worth.  She told you to figure it out and you did.", "NTA that lady must have zero awareness of what kids actually do.", "NTA, and to be blunt, in your shoes I would let this family go as clients if you can afford to. I doubt they pay you enough to deal with this much BS.", "op=NTA\n\n<<She told me it was my job to figure it out.>>  This was her permission--she told you to figure it out--you figured it out by putting her in play clothes.\n\nSuggestion:  Since husband seems to be on your side--ask him to bring in a couple changes of clothes.  Write her name on labels so when they get washed there's no confusion on who they belong to.  Change Breanne into her own clothes.  That way you have figured it out, she's in her own clothes and Dad gave you \"permission\"---so ALL good.", "NTA it\u2019s in my daycare handbook that proper play clothes and shoes are required to attend and I will turn you away at the door if you don\u2019t comply. You are far more generous than me.", "Exactly. She didn\u2019t like the results of your very practical solution. And she didn\u2019t like the alternative outcome either. She is a shallow \u2018nightmare customer\u2019. Don\u2019t let  this situation get you down especially as it sounds like you are very good at your job.", "3rd option is have the kid sit quietly in the corner all day being utterly miserable,  which is the option this mum seems to want.       \nI winder if she plays at home? Poor kid.", "Sadly, those terms are interchangeable for a lot of parents.", "Yeah just wait til the kid skins a knee or falls and bumps forehead = lawsuit city.\n\nAnd no, her pushover husband won't stop any of this.", "Ironically, Breanne was being tended to by a nanny prior to being placed with me. Daycare spots are hard to come by around here. But I think that's where the problem lies.", "She has explicit consent to change diapers and soiled clothing. So the only thing she did without consent was putting her in cheap clothing rather than designer, and I cannot bring myself to take that issue seriously. The mom needs to start parenting better.", "After the mother ignored the dirt warning and flipped out, I\u2019d have canceled the kid coming.  Mother is not worth it.    Poor kid.  NTA", "She's 18 months old. She's not potty trained. I have to change her regardless. Even my 2 older students who are potty trained, I help them get dressed if they have an accident. And their parents are aware. It comes with daycare. \n\nThe mom isn't mad that I took her daughter's clothes off. I've had to do that before when she had a poop explosion. She was just fine with it because I put her in the replacement clothes that she left.\n\nI don't think some of you understand how daycare works...the teachers are going to see your child naked at some points.", "At this point, if the mom still has a problem with the way you do things, you should kick her daughter out of your preschool. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Time to institute a dress code into your contract I guess.", "I think all parents understand clothes for young children aren\u2019t going to last forever.  They will either get ruined or they will grow out of them after only a few uses", "I am kinda curious as to who the craziest parent you have now.", "That\u2019s good.  Her crazy sounds like the type who would deduct a dry cleaning bill from her invoice because the child\u2019s clothes got dirty.", "That\u2019s a fact!", "She\u2019s used to 1:1 care that mom probably still wants but can\u2019t justify the spend. She needs to adjust and move on.", "Yeah I hear you, and the mother sounds unbearable, but there at least should have been a conversation. This seems sneaky, I would loose trust.", "Age doesn\u2019t mean anything my niece is 18 mos and potty trained. I\u2019ve worked daycare/preschool before teaching the 3yo class and I never saw a child naked even if there was an accident they would change themselves all I did was hand them fresh clothes and bag the old ones. It is different however when they aren\u2019t potty trained because you will have to change their diapers and will be seeing them in an intimate area regardless so changing clothes isn\u2019t as big of a deal as it would be if they were potty trained. You could say what I change her diaper everyday whats the big deal with clothes? But for a child that is potty trained there really isn\u2019t a valid excuse to ever see the child naked or in their underpants regardless of good intentions and can put you in a difficult spot or even a law suit. It just isn\u2019t worth it she can either deal with her daughters expensive clothes being destroyed or institute a dress code. We had a strict sneakers and socks only, shorts under dresses and play clothes mandatory as well as back ups in back packs in case of accidents. We were clear that we will be getting messy and playing outside. formal clothing was not permitted as it could be a distraction or safety hazard by getting snagged or stuck on something.", "I'll never put a dress code in my contract. Parents have enough shit to worry about than thinking \"oh no, will this fit the policy today?\"", "Currently going back and forth with a parent who is mad I told their child they cannot scream when they're upset. Keep in mind, this is a 4 year old.\n\nI said we can cry. We can use our words. We can pout. We can take some time and play in the sensory area/look at books/lay on the carpet and catch our breath. But we are not going to scream and scare our other friends, hurt their ears, etc.\n\nThis mom and I have had similar conversations before, because her child is held accountable for their actions here vs at a home where they get away with whatever. \n\nI'll take dress drama over \"But they're only 4! How can you expect them to tidy up after themselves?\"", "The poster stole part of a comment word for word. The original poster was cigfranblaidd", "There was a conversation.

I actually don't plan to and am going to speak with her further this weekend. I was explaining that I didn't put the girl into any physical harm by putting her in the clothes. There is no liability.\n\nI do accept I may be the asshole for doing it without talking to her mom first. I was just explaining myself in terms of the detergent/material."]}
