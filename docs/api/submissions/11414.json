Kids get dirty. Kids have accidents. Kids very often need a clothes change. \n\nI will advise you to do what she does. She has her parents sign a document that says they understand that due to activities that stimulate the brain, accidents, and the nature of outside play, clothes will get dirty and stained.  This document says my mom cannot be held responsible for the value of the ruined clothing. It also says the parents will provide clothes appropriate for activities conducted in a child care environment and that she can deny drop off if the child\u2019s clothes are not suitable for play. \n\nIt also outlines that the parents give my mom permission to change clothes as necessary or they can sign to opt out, she can call the parents when clothe changes are required to come to the daycare within  X amount of minutes to do it themselves or she can without repercussion. \n\nJust an idea. Up to you if it works for your business or not", "NTA\u2014 you explained your program.

Either the clothes get dirty, or she wears different clothes. Those are realistically the only two outcomes, and it's very generous of you to provide appropriate clothing. If the mom doesn't like it, she can find clothes that *can* get dirty which are still acceptable to her, or she can find a different childcare option.

So either she needs to deal with it or be okay with the clothes she picks being trashed and not complain/blame you. The kiddos Dad also gave you the thumbs up and he is also the girl's parent.\n\nI think it is an uncomfortable situation to think about someone else dressing your children, which is probably why your husband is where his is at, particularly not knowing.... But I think there are appropriate times to do so in child care. No kid wants to be stuck in their pee pants all day for example...", "ESH. Cindy much more, she sounds infuriating.

This parent actually brought play clothes for her son but expected me to change him back into good clothes when we weren\u2019t going outside or doing messy art projects. I just changed him into his play clothes and left them on all day. She would usually pick him up around outside time anyway and if she showed up unexpectedly, I would just make an excuse and offer to change his clothes for her. Because here\u2019s the thing:\n\nAin\u2019t nobody got time for that.\n\nBreanne is not the only child you have in your care. Your priority is the safety and happiness of all the children. You don\u2019t have the time, the eye balls, the arms,or mental capacity to worry about one child getting dirty. And I would tell that to Cindy next time she complains. Children are supposed to get dirty at daycare. It\u2019s how you know they had fun. \n\nAlso, not you, not the other children in your care, and probably not the other parents, give a flying crap that her kid is dressed like designer doll. It\u2019s not a beauty contest.", "NTA.

She just didn\u2019t like your solution. Ask her if you\u2019d rather she be excluded from painting or playing outside and instead be given princess activities since she\u2019s obviously a princess. Maybe while others paint she can play tea party. Or make a princess castle out of paper. And while others run along in the dirt, she can ride in a pretend carriage. Maybe you can find some cheap 2nd hand princess dresses that you don\u2019t mind getting dirty to put overtop of her dresses. And get those plastic booties to put over her dress shoes.", "ESH. Totally understandable what you did -but- you're intentionally trying to hide something from the parent and that's not good. Parents already worry about their kids being in someone else's care - the last thing they need is to feel like  the care providers are hiding things about what goes on.\n\nBest to let the parent learn their mistakes by ending up with dirty/torn designer clothes.

I\u2019m talking about matters of consent and what a parent would find appropriate.\n\nPersonally, I think you should inform the parent that her child won\u2019t to be welcome unless she can have proper attire.

You cannot cater your curriculum to one kid\u2019s outfits. The mom needs to accept your solution or accept her kids clothes will be dirty.

She\u2019s not happy if her clothes are dirty (kids will always get dirty), she\u2019s not happy if you put her in clothes that are fine to get dirty. She wants her child to not only wear these stupid ass clothes, but expects her not to act like a toddler in them.  Clearly her expectations of you and her own child do not match with the kind of daycare you run.", "NTA for all the reasons. The only thing that is a bit iffy to me is the fact that you didn't mention it at all to the parents before you did it. \n\nNo matter how good your intentions are (and I would've done the exact same if i was wearing your shoes, especially if the kid is not comfortable playing outside, that's just plain sad), it's always a good idea to at least mention what you're doing to the parents beforehand. This way, they don't have to  \"find out\" at the end of the week and feel betrayed I guess.", ">She told me it was my job to figure it out.\n\n\nNTA. She told you to figure it out and you did. Good job!", "NTA at all, but you have your answer. Leave Breanne in the inappropriate clothes. And don\u2019t worry about them being ruined. \n\nI\u2019m not saying to go out of your way to ruin them, just keep putting bibs and smocks on her, and if they get dirty, reinforce to whoever picks her up that it\u2019s why she needs to wear appropriate clothing like the other children.", "So, this mom doesn\u2019t want the pretty clothes getting dirty but won\u2019t put her in play clothes and won\u2019t let you change her into play clothes? I\u2019d say it\u2019s time you put the onus on her to 1.) stop getting mad clothes get dirty, 2.) put the child in proper play clothes, or 3.) find a new daycare because it\u2019s awfully clear there is a disconnect in expectations on both sides. The child is not a doll and she should become the rope in this power struggle/tug of war. \n\nI really don\u2019t know how to answer this because it should be a N T A but also, you shouldn\u2019t be putting kids in clothing not provided for them (if the kid has an allergic reaction to detergent used on that donated clothing, etc. that could be a liability so in that case a bit of E S H)", "NTA\n\nBreanne is 1.5 years old, so she doesn't care about her outfits. \n\nI don't understand why Cindy is upset that you protected her clothes from getting so dirty. When her daughter comes home, Cindy would have to constantly change her outfits, which would be annoying.\n\nAdditionally, you were upfront about these issues from the beginning. So, it's not like you decide to change every toddler's clothes because you feel like it.", "The woman is just a whole lot of trouble you don\u2019t need.", "YTA. Your intentions may have been noble, but you crossed a line. If you wanted to change a child\u2019s clothes you need their parents consent. I would pull my kid from your care if it were me.", "NTA.

Glad you have one realistic parent to deal with.", "NTA at all \n\nOne childcare worker to another, you know that\u2019s what had to be done. Mommy playing dress up with her little girl is all good a fine, until it inhibits that little girl from being able to live her life and be a normal toddler.

It takes all kinds. \n\nOp NTA if i had options I would of had lots change, unfortunately at our school gym cloths were only for grade 3 and up, due to kids taking up all of class changing and it's all in the booklets we sent home.", "I read those books back in the 90s and while it is not to that extreme...it's pretty close.

(If the parents knew it was happening, they wouldn't have been surprised by the photos) The OP literally says this \"I didn't tell Cindy what I was doing\"", "Taking care of small children is hectic enough - this shouldn't be an added issue you have to focus on. You've made it clear - appropriate footwear and clothing that kids can safely run in, climb in etc. Not party dresses and dainty shoes at 18 months old. If she wants designer clothing and footwear, that's fine as long as it's appropriate for the environment and the activities she'll be engaging in and the mom is fine with having those items dirty, stained and/or potentially damaged. If not, it might be easier to tell her to move onto a different provider.", "Ok. If you truly feel that her footwear is inappropriate then change that. Leave the rest of the stuff on. Her mom gets to dress her how she wants.  What\u2019s wrong with her footwear? She\u2019s not wearing tennis shoes?", "Thanks for your input. OP says that she is allowed to change the clothes. Still, I told her to leave the clothes on except maybe the shoes. I somewhat suspect that this is a clash of egos.", "You (and mom) may not know of an allergy until it happens.

That doesn\u2019t mean your luck won\u2019t run out either. \n\nAgain, I stress giving mom (and dad) the three options and a reasonable amount of time to decide what choice they pick. Yes you are in your right to change the child (hence diaper changes/outfit changes with blowouts, etc.). But you are pushing the boundary by introducing things (detergents, fragrances, etc.) that may or may not be known to the child. \n\nThat happened with my oldest (granted my oldest was 4 months old and being given foods and actual juice boxes despite our demands that it stop AND providing 12-20 oz of breast milk for 3-4 hours of care).", "That's awesome that you have that!!\n\nThen I'd say that child is going to have an awesome time and you get to smile and wave...\n\nJust smile and wave.\n\nChildren remember people like you in their lives - especially if a parent is more interested in having a living doll than a human fresh to the world!!", "The mother told OP to figure it out and she did. That definitely doesn't make her an AH.", "She has to reclaim the play clothes, though. If she let the toddler go home in them, she'd never get them back.", "I guess I don't consider that hiding it, so long as they didn't lie about it. Some things I'd consider lie by omission, but not this as they didn't ask...AND the mom *told her* to *figure it out.* That, IMO, is just figuring it out.", "She's wearing Mary Janes.", "It sounds to me like OP is just keeping the clothes clean, as the mother requested, but also doing what's in the child's best interest. Babies and toddlers need clothes that are easy to move and explore in to get the best out of experiences and work on their motor skills. I understand that it's the mother's right to dress her as a doll, even if that is so sad for that child, but if the clothes can't get dirty then it's unreasonable and OP was left with no good option. She can't neglect the child and not let her do anything that everyone else gets to do. I don't see where ego comes into it at all.", "The child isn't allergic to the detergent. Again, I have been using it since she started on her sheets. I show the parents what I use when they start and the mom said it's the same that \\*she\\* uses. So, there's no issue there. I also made sure and all the fabrics I have put her in, are ones found in the clothes that mom puts her in.\n\nWhat youa re talking about is wildly different. And I hope you reported that daycare. That's neglect and abuse.", "The mom told her to \"figure it out\" as in \"figure out how to keep my kid clean\" - that's why the mom continued to send her in designer clothing and continued to get upset when the kid got the clothes dirty. \n\nThat is NOT consent to change a parental decision, which is also why the mom said that no consent was given for this exact thing.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the parental decision is stupid or if the provider *thinks* it doesn't matter. If a parent made a decision about something, then the provider needs explicit consent to override that decision.", "That's not the problem. The problem is she let the parents think that their child was in the original designer clothes all day. She intentionally did not tell the parents she was re-dressing their kid every day.\n\nThis would be a non-issue if she got the parents' consent. To put it another way - if a parent made a specific decision about their child - what the kid eats, wears, etc..., then a daycare provider needs consent to override that parental decision.", "The mom clearly cares a lot about the clothes because she kept making the intentional decision to dress her daughter like that, even when it wasn't appropriate for daycare play. She demonstrated this with her decisions and her freakouts.\n\nOP didn't tell the mom because she knew the mom wasn't being reasonable. She knew it would be a big deal to the mom who was clearly investing a lot into designer clothes. She just wanted to avoid the mom saying no.\n\nThere WAS a right way to do this. OP should have just told the mom that Breanne couldn't come to the daycare unless she was dressed in play-inappropriate clothing or else she could be permitted to change Breanne into normal clothing.", "What\u2019s wrong with those?", "Mother requested that the child wear the clothes that she was sent to school with. The child does not have to be left out of any activities.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to call it if the OP is going out of her way to change the child into different clothes when that is not necessary. Again, I do understand the shoes if they are harmful to the feet.", "Ok. You keep changing her into clothes the parents don\u2019t provide. I mean it\u2019s your option. I\u2019m telling you the professional choices but it\u2019s your life and your choice. Keep engaging in the power struggle with the mom *just* like you\u2019re doing here by arguing how *right* you are. Have fun continuing to fight with the mom.", "Putting the burden on the provider to magically make a 1.5 year old stay clean is ridiculous. I have a 1.5 year old and they do NOT follow instruction. If OP was a nanny (she isn\u2019t) it would be one thing and she could design a whole curriculum to prioritize\u2026 clothes? But she has other kids to assist and can\u2019t cater activities to just one kid.", "I'm not saying that you're wrong, and I am sure that the parent does feel that way, but there wasn't going to be a way that could happen. If the parent is not going to be smarter to not dress the child in a way where she has on things that are okay to get dirty, OP had to do something. I can bet that if OP had decided to just not let the child paint or play outside and took pictures of her sitting to the side while those activities happened, that would have caused trouble as well. \n\nThank you for sharing your POV.", "For one, a toddler cannot run and properly play in them all day, every day. They don't have the proper support or traction. Again, shoes like this are meant for holiday cards or special events. Not every day.\n\nFor two, they're cute and all, but they're getting dirty when we go outside. Which \\*I\\* don't care about, but her mother does.", "When I was 4 I knocked my teeth out because I fell from running around while wearing Mary Jane\u2019s. I was with a babysitter at the time. The poor lady was so distraught. My parents were nice about it but something tells me this lady wouldn\u2019t hesitate to blame OP and sue.", "Yes it IS absolutely ridiculous. There is no argument that the mom is an AH for multiple things, including ridiculous demands. I have two young kids myself, so I know how messy they can be.\n\nThe point is simply about getting consent to change a parent's very clear decision about what they wanted their kid to wear. It doesn't matter how ridiculous the mom is - she is still the parent and the parent gets to decide what they want their kid to wear. Period.\n\nOP bypassed consent because she thought it \"wouldn't be a big deal\" which it *obviously* would be, given Cindy's fixation on fancy clothes. In reality, she simply disagreed with the parental choice and changed it without letting them know. And that makes her an AH, too.\n\nBy the way, consent extends to every parental decision. One of my kids loves Cheerios but we found out over time that he has a really bad reaction to them for some reason. At school, we found out that the teacher was sometimes just giving out Cheerios as snacks (we provided snacks that he was okay with, so they were skipping over the snacks we provided and they never asked for consent).\n\nThis would never have been an issue if OP had informed the parents and required consent as a condition for Breanne going to that daycare (which would be a perfectly legitimate requirement).", "Care providers get consent for all sorts of things. It's a pretty normal way that things work. Some consent is required (e.g. your child must wear play-inappropriate clothing in order to attend the daycare). This is what the OP should have done. Parents will consent to a lot of stuff if it means they can use the service.\n\nOP was trying to bypass that process and act as the parent.", "They also hurt and leave blisters if you wear them for too long. I was a snazzy child by choice and even then I never left the Mary Janes on for more than an hour or two because they just *hurt*", "I\u2019m only agree with you for the first reason. If the shoes are harming the child, then you should change them. But you shouldn\u2019t change the rest of the clothes. You have no right.  \n\nMom would have to be a moron to complain about dirty clothes when she\u2019s not providing different ones and doesn\u2019t want you to change the child. So just ignore her complaints.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s a dickish to dress the child contrary to what the parent wishes. Again, I only justify the shoes because that\u2019s harming the child.", "In all fairness, you could fall and knock your teeth oit wearing any type of shoe. And yes, if a child is injured at a daycare, the parent is going to sue. \n\nAnother poster shared that she used to get blisters from wearing hers. I think that\u2019s a pretty compelling reason to change into more comfortable shoes.", "That is important info. Thank you."]}
