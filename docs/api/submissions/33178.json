Make plans because for whatever reason he doesn't want to leave yet, but he certainly wants to have someone else, too. NTA", "NTA. IMO, if he\u2019s acting suspiciously and spending way too much time talking with another woman, you are entirely justified in checking out what\u2019s happening by any means available to protect yourself.

You\u2019re NTA for texting her (although what does it help?) or confronting him (although you KNOW he lied, so, like, you gotta deal with that) but you are a bit of an AH for staying with him when you don\u2019t trust him.  If you can\u2019t trust him, you can\u2019t trust him and you need to deal with that and accept the consequences of it.  \n\nYou know at this point, with actual evidence, how little respect he has for you and how little he\u2019s doing to keep your trust.  So\u2026. How are you gonna handle that?", "NTA. He showed you he doesn\u2019t respect you and is willing to lie to you and do things he knows you would be uncomfortable with behind your back. Frankly, if I caught by husband doing this, I\u2019d be seriously reconsidering the relationship.", "NTA. I'd send the screenshots to his friend at work.

I dealt with the same bullshit with my ex husband, who unbeknownst to me, had cheated on every girl he\u2019s ever been with. He constantly lied and made me think I was crazy for voicing concerns. Kick his ass to the curb. You\u2019ll be much happier.", "NTA this is a recipe for disaster on his part. The fact that he has cheated before means he probably understands this. The fact that he said he'd stop and didn't, just hid it means there's a good chance he's interested.
