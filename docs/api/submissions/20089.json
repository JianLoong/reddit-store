I got leather shoes, those wide brown pants and this beige/ light brown jackets (you know which one I mean). I even got one of those old people hats that they have in the show peaky blinders.\n\nI started to dress like this when we go out (restaurants etc.).

If she just likes the style well not much can be done about that, you should let her have her own likes and dislikes whether you like them or not, but that goes for her as well if you want to wear old man clothes than more to you but if you're doing it just out of spite that's kind of a jerk thing to do.", "EHS,\n\nYou should let her dress in whatever makes her comfortable. She shouldn't have to dress in a way that makes you happy/attracted but makes her uncomfortable, the most important is that she feels pretty/happy. Trying to control her like that isn't a good idea. When you dressed like an old man, she probably felt like you made fun of her which might have hurt her feelings a bit. However, you should be able to dress in whatever makes you happy as well. If you can't get mad at her for dressing how she wants, then she has no right to get mad at you.

Women at this time in history are finally getting that they do not need to dress for anyone but themselves. What you like no longer matters. If she likes it and is comfortable and it\u2019s appropriate for the situation is all that matters. We are no longer acting like folks that men can dress up.", "INFO: really ask yourself, do you love your girlfriend or do you love *how your girlfriend looks next to you?* Because if the answer is \u201cI love my girlfriend\u201c then you need to respect that she is literally an entirely separate human being from you with her own opinions, likes, dislikes, fashion sense, etc. I had a girlfriend who wore every fashion item that I absolutely couldn\u2019t stand, but I loved her, and I loved how uniquely she expressed her personality through her outfits, even though they weren\u2019t the outfits I would have picked for her (because she\u2019s her own person!)", "If she wants to consider your taste she can.  Acting like a child might not be the way to get her to want that.", "No. It\u2019s not. I dress very unusual. My husband helps me pick up my clothing. I wanted to see how I would look with a shaved head. My husband shaved my head even though he loves my hair. It has grown now, but purple. He loves me for me, and so he wants me to be happy and comfortable with what I wear.", "Hold up\u2026. Your responses in the comments\u2026. Didn\u2019t this exact same scenario get posted here awhile ago but with a different aesthetic? \n\nAnyone else having deja vu?", "It's much less important than how she feels about her clothing.", "He\u2019s TA for thinking he has the right to have input into what she wears. He\u2019s silly for dressing like an old man to retaliate.", "Not to mention that personal style evolves a lot between your early 20s and your late 20s. Expecting a woman to keep dressing like she\u2019s 20 for the rest of her life is pretty unreasonable.\n\nYTA, for so so so many reasons I can\u2019t even count them all.", "Yep! Talk about cutting of your nose to spite your face\n\nBut I don't think that makes somebody an asshole", "You can't tell others how to dress and they can't tell you either.", "I have what other people call \u2018ugly\u2019 sandals and I love them. Doc Marten Blaire!", "I was there for Y2K , and we didn't dress up like grannies, thank you very much.", "Watch his hair not grow back like he\u2019s expecting.", "Or completely alone to enjoy her granny clothes and maybe a cat and a garden\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She is getting angry at it though and wanting him to change back like he is doing to her.  Leaning more ESH.", "He is doing this with the specific goal of making fun of her and she knows it. If he genuinely liked dressing this way and expressed that I doubt she'd have a problem", "She\u2019s likely angry he\u2019s acting like a child and assuming he can have a say in what she wears. That would piss me off too.", "She's not an asshole for being angry at her partner for trying to control the way she dresses. Just because he's manipulating her through a visual comedy routine doesn't make it OK.", "Both are TAs anyway and op acts like a kid", "If you say so, wouldn't agree tho", "Agree to disagree.\ud83e\udd17"]}
