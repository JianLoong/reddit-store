In the future he would have done the same thing whenever you disagreed. And he was probably counting on you being in a public place for you to silently accept it and not cause a scene.\r  \n\r  \nSince he is very religious and did this on Women Day, it sounds like he wanted to assert his (male) will over yours.

He made a big deal about the date being what she wanted, then decided to get tickets for something he knew she wouldn't like.  It was a training exercise for her expectations.  She can want what she wants, but HE controls what she gets.  She was supposed to meekly say \"OK\" to watching a film she knew she would hate to prepare for a relationship in which they'd do what HE'd want.  But he overshot and blew it. That's why he apologized.  He needed to make her happy before he crushed her spirit.  She wasn't childish.  She saw what was going on, and knew he had no respect for her.
