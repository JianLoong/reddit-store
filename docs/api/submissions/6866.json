It was to my horror when my mother let it slip that they intended to throw one, 2 days before my due date with family flying out from across the country. There are so many reasons I didn't want a baby shower, the main one being I have only been to three baby showers in my life, and two of the three babies died. The third I attended was when I was a teen, and my aunt (who it was being thrown for) was drunk the entire time, and now I have to look at my nephew has many deformities from her alcohol abuse and think of that horrible party.\n\nI am honestly not completely over the trauma of my baby cousin dying, and at times I struggle with anxiety relating to my current pregnancy. There is no part of me who wants a baby shower, it all just reminds me of pain. I might have been more open to it if anyone asked or planned it more than two days before my due date. Not to mention if my son is born early, I do not want to be hosting a party I never asked for with my newborn. \n\nMy family is upset. It's my mom's first grandchild, and my inlaws first grandson. My Mom told me I might regret it in the future if I don't have one, but I'm more scared of holding one and having a mental breakdown infront of countless people. People already bought tickets and bought gifts. Everyone else wants a baby shower so bad, but I just feel like puking every time I think about it. All it reminds me of is the corpse of my baby cousin and that it could be my son.

Furthermore, remind them that due dates aren't promises, and due dates for first pregnancies are especially unreliable.    If, as isn't unlikely, you give birth to your baby before the due date, the last thing you'll want is a party.  Even if you don't, nobody who is heavily pregnant should be required to go to a party.  The last month of a pregnancy is exhausting.\n\nTell the family that you'd love to see them in [your period of time after the birth], but since you aren't sure when the baby will be born, a party just before the due date is asking for trouble.  \n\n*Other people's plans are not your responsibility*.   It's on your mother and in-laws that they made reservations before even asking you if they could come.", "NTA. Organising a surprise event so close to your due date is incredibly rude without seeking your permission first. You need to be in a physically and emotionally safe safe, for your health and your baby\u2019s. Stand your ground on this.", "NTA \n\nYou need to talk seriously with your Mum. \n\nYou have trauma associated with Baby Showers. Whether it is rational or not does not matter at all!\n\n2 days before your due date is an insane time to have a baby shower. Baby showers are much earlier than that so that the \u201cMum\u201d has the ability to enjoy it, is still comfortable in the pregnancy and has no chance of delivering before the shower. \n\nYou cannot put your body through that amount of stress right before a baby is born. The amount of socializing, moving around, stress on you because of your trauma is way too much! \n\nTell you Mum that you cannot have a baby shower at all because of your trauma, the timing and that you don\u2019t want one!\n\nThis will be practice for when you need to set some boundaries when the baby is born", "Not all cultures do baby showers. My family doesn't because it's belived to be inviting trouble.  It should be your choice to have one and 2 days before your due date is insane.  Most of my kids were born 5 days before their due date. Nta", "NTA\n\nAnother reason to not do it. You don\u2019t want to be around a bunch of people who just got off a plane 2 days before your due date. If you get sick. It will significantly complicate your labor and delivery.\n\nWhy are all of these people flying in? Are they expecting to meet your baby immediately after you deliver? That would also be a terrible plan. You should talk to your OB and your baby\u2019s pediatrician about these plans.", "NTA.  Like \"pranks\", \"surprise parties\" should rarely be done and only if you know that the recipient will be okay with it.", "NTA. While I can appreciate that lots of people are excited, your pregnancy is about you and the baby. Extra stress is not good for either of you. If your mother knew you didn't want a shower, she shouldn't have done it behind your back. If she didn't know, she still should have asked before she did it, especially given the potentially negative associations. If they insist on having this party, they can have it without you and your husband can go instead, explaining that you aren't feeling well enough to attend. That close to your due date, you have a built-in opt-out. The same applies right after the baby is born. They get their party, and you avoid the upset. You could do a video chat to say hello and thank everybody for coming, but only if it's not too upsetting for you.", "NAH. You get to call the shots. I could see just changing the focus to a family party/reunion, but two days before your due date is rude.", "NTA, you are the mom and you could easily be in labor when they arrive. Your family is ignoring that you are going through labor and delivery in favor of throwing a party to celebrate the arrival of a new baby in the family. Your pregnancy, labor, and delivery are the key things for them to support right now. A celebration can wait until later.", "NTA - This is your baby, not your family's. As a mother you are going to have to learn to set boundaries and hold them to protect yourself and your child. Look at this as your practice round of standing up to your family.  Best wishes on the new baby!", "Oh love, I'm so sorry NTA.\n\nIt's understandable you wouldn't want to attend. But given all the travel plans made an everything, is it possible for the baby's father or a friend or relative to attend in your place? You can be 'sick' if you don't want to explain how distressing it is to go to a baby shower. That way you can see your family (they could come say hello, not as a part of the party) they can have their shower, and you can also get some necessities for the baby.", "NAH. Talk to your mom and the other planners and tell them how traumatic past experience has been. They may still want to make this great for you. Sounds like you want to be a great parent.", "NTA and they shouldn't force this on you.", "NTA. I am glad that you have family members who care so much about you and your child. However, I think it was a bit obtuse to plan a surprise baby shower when your family has a history of infant trauma. Your mum should definitely have at least TRIED to feel out how your thoughts about a shower before planning such a complex party.\n\nOftentimes, people who plan surprise parties have good intentions but do not take into account the feelings of the guest of honor. Good intentions can still be selfish ones, and you noted that your family seems to think the shower is more about their happiness than yours. \n\nThey can get refunded for the plane tickets and your family will get over it. You can have a big get together, with your child actually present, when you are recovered and feeling positively about them being there.", "NTA. Your mom is doing this for HERSELF, not you.", "NTA. Who thinks it is a good idea to pull this stunt? Even without the trauma of the previous baby showers, your baby could arrive early, you want to rest (hello bathroom) and finish preparing.\n\nAnd then the whole crowd will want to hangout waiting for you to deliver.", "My heart hurts for you, OP. NTA.\n\nYou don't want a shower. You know it would be a triggering event. You don't owe it to ANYONE to attend a baby shower.\n\nThey've scheduled it 2 days before your due date!? That sounds like a nightmare. You'd be super pregnant and uncomfortable, in labor, or already delivered and not up for that kind of huge event. None of those scenarios would be pleasant, and that's not even taking your trauma into account.\n\nPut a stop to the shower as soon as you can. If it was me, I'd get my husband to help with this. \n\nHe can call the hosts and say, \"wife doesn't want a shower. The one you're planning is way too close to her due date; it will not be possible for her to attend. If people want to give something for baby, they can mail it to us.\"", "NTA. Trauma aside, a baby shower so close to the due date is ridiculous. A surprise shower sounds like a nightmare.\n\nIf everyone wants a baby shower so bad, they go on and have their baby shower without you or your baby.

Your fear is very irrational but you don\u2019t have the time between now and the planned shower to work through that.\n\nTread carefully, your family did a very sweet thing and I can see them struggling to understand because there is no connection between baby showers and stillbirth or FAS.

But your brain doesn\u2019t fear those things because it didn\u2019t make that connection. \n\nHowever, it is important for you to do the least stressful thing while you are pregnant and if a shower stresses you out you shouldn\u2019t have one. \n\nIf some people can\u2019t refund their plane tickets maybe help them come up with a compromise like a dinner out or going to a sporting event and allow them to give you any gifts they bought. \n\nI have to go NAH", "NTA.

If your relatives go ahead with it regardless, you do not have to attend. With a bit of luck, you will have given birth by then, and you can tell hospital staff that you do not want any visitors, not even family. And if you have not given birth by then, make sure that the hospital knows that you do not want the birth of your child to be turned into a spectator sport, and that you only want your partner in the room with you, or whoever else you have decided on having there, and that everybody else is not allowed in.
