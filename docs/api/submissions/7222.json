Our mom unfortunately passed away 15 years ago and my father started consuming too much alcohol and neglecting his children, so I started taking care of my siblings as the elder. I also had to take care of my dad occasionally since he didn't have anyone else in the extended family willing to do so and the only friends he had were also addicts. \n\nMy brother and sister went NC with my dad but I couldn't do so, since I still had responsibility for him. I never spent time with him outside of finding him somewhere in the city blackout drunk and then getting him home. My siblings offered to help me out on taking care of him but I refused because I knew they hated his guts. \n\nOne day when this happened again I had a big argument with my father about his behavior. He acted very remorseful and guilty for messing up our childhood and I told him that the only way he can make things better is to get sober since now he is ruining our adulthood too along with that. He gave me a promise and surprisingly he was holding on alright. \n\nNow onto the situation. My sister was 9 months pregnant back when this occurred and could give birth at any possible moment. Me and my brother were spending time with her when her contractions started so we called her husband from work and all arrived to the hospital. During that time my dad's friend has been calling me repeatedly and when we finally arrived to the hospital I was able to answer his call. He told me to come quick as my dad had an alcohol poisoning. I was scared for him but also pissed that he got drunk with his friends again. \n\nFortunately he ended up alive but I asked him why was he not staying sober when he said he doesn't want to go to rehab and can handle everything by himself. He told me that going fully clean is hard to which I agreed, but I also told him that having a drink or two and getting drunk to the point you get poisoning is not the same thing. I also told him that I won't be taking care of him anymore and I'm going to get him to the rehab instead. My dad was not happy with the fact that I ignored an emergency but understood everything else I said and agreed to rehab.\n\nMy brother supported me and told me that my dad should be thankful I was empathetic enough to not go NC with him and taking care for him for years, but my dad's friends all called me an AH for not arriving as he could've easily died and they couldn't possibly take care of him.\n\nAITA, Reddit?", "created_utc": 1673616746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10aumup/aita_for_staying_with_my_sister_instead_of/", "score": 275, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father had multiple warnings and second chances and decided to ignore them all. After all, he wasn't there when his daughter was giving birth, was he? She had no choice about putting her life at risk with a childbirth at that particular moment, but his decision to drink enough to go straight into poisoning was deliberate.", "Nta. Your hands are tied. Your presence cannot be summoned at two places at once.\n\nAnd may I also suggest, could you please tell your father to start cutting himself loose from his circle of friends? I am sitting here wondering to what extent are they going to be a bad influence on him.", ">since I still had responsibility for him\n\nYou didn't and you don't. He put himself in a risky situation. It's not you visiting your dad would have stopped the incident. If he's just mad he didn't get your undivided attention because you had someone else going on, then that's on him.\n\nYour father has to grow up and take responsibility for himself.

You are not clairvoyant. \n\nIt's really hard but try not to make HIS addiction your downfall too. \n\nYou cannot control addicts, they will lie, steal and cheat because addiction is a disease. \n\nSo whilst it is not his fault, you have to remember that is also not your responsibility to support him 24/7", "NTA\n\nYou were not available.

(Or even an Uber/taxi to drop him at a hospital) Addiction is a bitch, and a serious problem...but he will drag you down with him if you let him.

You \"ignored\" an emergency that his \"friends\" couldn't handle but they are close enough to be able to call you to take care of it? Him and his group suck. \n\nI'm sorry about your mom passing away and that making you the caretaker. IN my eyes, you're the closest thing to a parental* figure your sister may have and I know when I was pregnant, the emotional support of your parents* or closest parental* figure goes a long way. \n\nWhile many say you can choose family by choosing to go NC, I hope your father sticks to getting help\n\n*edited as OP is M not F.", "NTA - first of all you don't owe him anything, you don't have to take care of him and his so called friends, you owe them even less than nothing.

You\u2019ve had to be an adult from a young age. You are still helping your father but going to the hospital because he has alcohol poisoning over being there for your sister giving birth is a no brainer. \n\nYou\u2019ve been giving to him your whole life, now you are setting some boundaries. When you have an addict in your life, you need boundaries. Hopefully rehab can be the step he needs but that is up to him.", "NTA\n\nat some point you have to make the decision you can't help everyone and that includes family. \nAt that moment your sister was your priority and not only her, but subconscious you have been your priority yourself.  \nYou didn't have the capacity to help him, people tend to forget and some even ignore that just cause you don't show any immediate symptoms, there is a lot that can turn into physical problems.\nNow that you had a chance to recover, you are still willing to support your father, there is nothing you have to blame yourself for. \nIf his friend have been that incapacitated neither of them would have been able to call an ambulance, they should worry about what they do together.\n\nI cross my fingers the rehab works and that maybe your niece is what motivates your father to get sober, so he at least turn into a good grandpa.", "This is just sad for everyone involved. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Supporting your sister takes priority over caring for a drink asshole, even if the drunk asshole is your father. \n\nYour father's friends are also assholes.", "NTA of course. You are a great son and he is lucky to have you. He owes you, you don't owe him. \n\nIt's great that your dad tried to stay sober and you can be proud of him. I am very familiar with this situation. The rehab will bring him the mental support he needs on top of medication.", "NTA. Your dad *chose* to drink. He chooses to *continue* drinking. He chose to drink until he had alcohol poisoning. \n\nHis so-called \"friends\" are wanting to put the blame for his situation on you in order to take it off them. They were there; they claim to be his friends: They *could* have tried to stop him from drinking that much.  Also, there was nothing you could do anyway; he obviously needed emergency care for the alcohol poisoning \u2014 and even if you were an ER physician yourself, you wouldn't be able to do anything on your own. He needed to go to the ER, where they have the knowledge, skills, and equipment to save him.\n\nAlcoholics and addicts do in fact often need to \"hit bottom\" before they finally realize how they're fucking up their own lives as well as the lives of the people who care about them. Hitting bottom often means they've alienated everyone who cares about them to the extent that they no longer have anyone willing to enable them or help them or make excuses for them. This is what your father needs: Everyone who cares about him finally saying \"no\" to \"helping\" him any futher, because it's not help. It's enabling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's especially not your job to help cushion his falls... if he, an adult, wants to drink himself to the point of poisoning himself, he can damn well eat the spoon full of shit that is the consequence alone and has no right to complain that people were not there. The man won't hit rock bottom and learn his lesson if you cushion the fall.  They want to coddle him when he needs to feel the full brunt of his decisions.", "NTA. It's heartbreaking, but at some point your father is going to have to accept responsibility for his actions.

I don't know if that's true for everyone, but it sounds like it may be for your dad. I'm so sorry you're going through this, but try to remember that he is grown and you are the child, not the parent. If he is ruining your adulthood, you can walk away.

OP needs to tell him he\u2019s on his own, and get themselves to Al Anon and learn how to stop taking care of his disease because no one can help him but him.  Also, he can\u2019t have just one drink, it doesn\u2019t work that way, once an alcoholic takes a drink there really is no stopping, the brain kicks in and cravings start, it\u2019s a vicious cycle, hence the need for treatment.", "Ah thanks for the correction.", "Nta.

These are people who are clearly enabling him. They're likely alcoholics themselves and expect family to take care of them.", "NTA. The appropriate response when you think someone has alcohol poisoning is to call 911. The friends are assholes. Since they are abusing substances, I would not trust their opinion on your choices. They were the ones who drank with him until he poisoned himself with alcohol, and then called you expecting you to fix it instead of calling 911.  Of course they want you to continue to come rescue him so that they don't have to take care of him so they don't loose a drinking buddy.\n\nYou are doing exactly what you should be doing right now.

I get that ambulances are crazy expensive but having someone getting violently sick or dying in the car they use for their livelihood isn't okay.", "Just want to jump on my own statement. Alcoholism will probably be what kills him in the future, whether you take care of him or not. Alcohol kills people prematurely. It's just what it does. I believe alcoholics die about 20 years earlier than non alcoholics on average. You are in no way responsible for his life choices, and it's unrealistic to think you can save him. If you can, see a therapist or join a support group to give you perspective on how HE has failed you. You haven't failed him.", "It would literally be his fault, not yours. Addicts are very good at manipulation. Set solid boundaries for yourself and stick to them no matter how much they may hurt. By being there constantly for him, you've taught your father that his actions have no serious consequences because you'll always be there. I cannot recommend going NC strongly enough. His friends are of no matter to you. If they're so worried about him, they can care for him. Live your life for you, and stop letting it revolve around your father.", "I think you should look for an Al Anon group or something similar.", "How in the world were you tricked into believing that YOU were responsible for him?

He's playing Russian roulette - why would you blame yourself for not sitting with him every night and taking the weapon out of his hand?  Why would that be your fault?  He's making the choice to pick up the bottle.  He's making the choice to refuse rehab.  He's making the choice to associate with people that will call you to tell you to come deal with the emergency while refusing to deal with the emergency.    Why should you miss significant events in your life and the lives of your friends and family to continue to clean up after someone making the choice to make the mess?\n\nYou don't exist in this world to care for him.

Unfortunately, sometimes people need to hit rock bottom before they seek help.  If you continue to bail him out, you are enabling him.", "It\u2019s very standard thinking. It\u2019s really really hard to be the child of an alcoholic. I was married to one for a long time. There are very deep wounds. Maybe, just maybe, you can save him this time, and things will be different, and the family will be whole again.", "NTA\nYou aren't responsible for your father.

Go no contact, if he gets sober you can talk to him again.", "NTA - i would say go to hell and move on with my life.", "NTA I too am an adult child of an alcoholic. Your father cannot get sober alone. Going through withdrawal without medical care can very likely kill him. Alcohol withdrawal is more serious than most people realize. He does need a program and you are in no way responsible for him, his actions, or for caregiving. It took me to my mid twenties to learn that I was an enabling caregiver and have since gotten therapy for myself for the codependency and enmeshment of parenting my addict parent. I sincerely hope you seek therapy for yourself and learn to take responsibility for your own self without feeling the need to  control and take care of your father.", "NTA I mean, your sister was in labour and needed help with that so one emergency at a time is plenty", "NTA.

His friends could have called 911 and got him to the hospital for the care he needed. Realistically you can't be there every time he decides to get drunk. Just not a healthy option for you to even entertain. Drop him at rehab and let it go. He's got to be the one to do the work of staying sober, you can't do it for him. You've been enabling his behavior, which is counterproductive. He's got to suffer the consequences of his actions and if that means getting arrest for public intoxication and ending up in jail, so be it. Get some counseling for yourself. I mean look at your question. Why would anyone think that they would be an AH for supporting their pregnant sister rather than a frequently drunk father. You can't be responsible for his actions.

The \u2018friends\u2019 wanted to look like they were doing something positive after the fact so they could blame you for not turning up, which absolves them from enabling him to get that way.", "friends are mad because all they see is an unsupportive son. I doubt that OP's father has sung his praises over the years so they'd never know any different other than this \"one\" time OP was \"needed\"", "An addiction counsellor (who was in recovery herself, and a pillar of her local sober community) once told me that you shouldn't rely on an addict hitting \"rock bottom\" like that will wake them up from their addiction and they will seek help, take rehab seriously, etc. She told me for some people that their \"rock bottom\" is the 6ft under and there's nothing you can do to control that, despite all the near-death experiences and the efforts of those around them to \"save\" them. If your father wants to drink himself to death he will find a way to do it, your efforts are just prolonging the process unless he's actually making a mindset change and efforts on his own. I would strongly recommend you reading \"adult children of emotionally immature parents\" by Lindsay C. Gibson. It will help you work through these feelings of guilt and hypervigilance around your father after what you describe as years of parentification. You don't owe your father anything, and if anything it sounds like you and him have a codependent relationship that will very likely eat away at your own adulthood. Sometimes the healthiest thing is to step away. You can't keep lighting yourself on fire to keep your father warm.", "Please check out support groups like al anon  to help you set healthy boundaries with your dad. You can only do so much if he\u2019s not willing to help himself and you will kill yourself trying.", "In primary school, we went to an organization of ex-alcoholics. One guy there told us that they needed to get to the lowest point before seeing they need to change anything. And that his family showing disgust openly was actually better than if thay had tried to be nice to him.", "Then love, (OP) get thee to therapy.  The only person who can save dad is dad and dad has to WANT to be saved.  I'm pretty sure you know this already but I'm hoping a light bulb goes off in OP's head.  She's done everything she can do to try to get something that's never coming back.  She's drowning while trying to save a drowning person.\n\nSometimes you gotta learn to let go or they drag you down with them."]}
