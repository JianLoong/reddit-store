Yes. Does he really deserve a broken ankle? No, that was harsh. Also, what caused his broken ankle has nothing to do with the sport - there is no reason for him to not play the sport he loves - why are you pushing this?

I don't live in the US anymore but damn if I did that while we were there, I would have put my family into so much debt (thanks broken system).

Your son trying to tell you you don't believe in him seems to me like he is angry at himself and is trying to shift the focus of his anger to you. Because it's easier to be angry at the world around him than being angry at himself.\nEdit: grammar", "YTA. I think the broken ankle was enough. Calling him stupid isn\u2019t helpful.", "YTA the minute you decided to deliver a lecture to a kid suffering the natural consequences of his own stupidity. Honestly, you could have just stfu and not kicked the kid while he was down.", "NTA  \nWho are these touchy feely folks who think \"you deserve this\" is uncalled for or harsh.  \n\n\nFuck around and fight out, play stupid games win stupid prizes, you reap what you sew, and so on, we have many, many, many sayings and expressions to exactly this effect.  \n\n\nAt fourteen, you should fucking know better.  It's ABSOLUTELY appropriate to tell Kettle-Bell Pele that his dumbass got exactly what it deserved for ignoring every critical thinking lesson life had provided up to this point.  The word \"dumbass\" is wholly appropriate, and I'm sorry, I don't think we should go out of our way to avoid acknowledging that the kid was a dumbass and did something incredibly stupid and absolutely deserved it.  \n\n\nNo one else made those choices.  It wasn't a trap, it wasn't an accident, it wasn't a weight painted like a soccer ball, no one was egging him on or pressuring him to do it, he thought it'd be fun, he made the idiot-choices every step of the way, he LITERALLY deserves this.  This is a direct consequence of the choices he made, as imposed by the laws of fucking physics and limitations of biology, it's nobody's fault but his, he literally deserved it, he literally earned it, there's nothing wrong with telling him that.    \n\n\nYou people who think nothing is more important than a child's feelings are really undervaluing the critical step of \"learning lessons\" in comparison.  There was one of these the other days, racist kid was the only one not invited to a birthday party and the comments were full of feeling-over-thinking half-wits whining over the poor racists feelings, and forgive me, but that's some shortsighted dumbfuckery.  The LESSON is what matters, the moral, the teachable moment, not their ickle fucking feewings.  Be a racist, get treated poorly, that's a lesson, that's a valuable fucking lesson, and this is the exact same sort of thing.  \n\n\nOh no, you were made to feel stupid for doing something really stupid?  Fucking good, you should feel stupid, you WERE stupid, you did a stupid thing on purpose and as a result you absolutely should feel stupid, grow to hate that feeling, and then make choices that hopefully avoid it going forward.  That's the point!  That's the entire learning process!  That's how it's supposed to work!", "\"I have two boys (Nathan and Lewis) and one girl (Gracie)\n\n ... my middle child Isaac\"\n\nInteresting...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefinitely YTA for telling child they deserved a broken bone. Telling him that what he did was stupid is harsh but true; telling him that you hoped it \"taught him a lesson\" is pretty aggressive.\n\nI think I agree with your wife. I'd have gone with a \"What did we learn?\" approach. That way your kid doesn't have a chance of thinking you just called him stupid, he's not discouraged *and* you know whether or not he learned the right lesson from it.", "YTA,  he is a kid.

You can still think the behavior was stupid, which it was. But you definitely could have voiced your thoughts and feelings in a more constructive way.

That\u2019s a messed up thing to say to a kid. 14 is still young enough to make really stupid decisions like that, he is still a kid with a developing brain. Words can be very harmful, especially coming from a parent.", "YTA. Yes what he did was extremely foolish, but saying he deserved it was going too far.", "YTA. Why not try encouraging your kids?", "14 year old boys are incredibly stupid..ask any teacher..", "YTA and a terrible parent. Poor kid. To know his dad doesn't give a crap about him.", "YTA.  I am sure he did not need you to rub his nose in it and belittle him to boot.", "NTA\nKids this age don't think (at all) Did you ask him if he at least scored a goal?", "100% Nta but great story", "YTA. He doesn't have a developed frontal lobe. Stop expecting teens to make decisions like adults would. He's learned a lesson about kicking things he shouldn't. You mocking him doesn't make that lesson any more learned. Instead, it teaches another lesson: don't talk to dad when something bad happens in my life, he'll just mock me.", "NTA, he's 14 and thought kicking a weight wouldn't end badly? Yeah, he needed to learn the hard way.", "Jeez. Why didn't you just call him a ret@&d.\n\n Do you think he doesn't know he did something stupid.  We all did at that age. Your disdain for his soccer skills comes through loud and clear. At least his siblings have his back. YTA", "Yta. Was it dumb? Yes. But not everybody is good at any sport right at the begining. Sport needs time and practices. Your attitude will only cause harm in the long run.", "YTA. He already knows what he did was reckless (\"stupid\" is never a great choice of words when speaking to your child, even if it's accurate.)\n\nWhen my husband, son, and now grandson ever do (which I could say \"did\") anything reckless, I usually just say \"what did you think was going to happen?\"\n\n14 is a prime age for acting without thinking first. Criticizing or name calling after the fact never helps. I realize you said what he did was stupid, but in a child's mind what he heard was his dad calling him stupid.", "YTA kids only get better with practice. Telling your kids he deserves a broken ankle?

Yes\n\nHe didn't deserve the broken ankle but it's not unexpected that it happened", "YTA pretty fucking mean dude", "Yta, who talks to their kid like that, after they got injured", "All fine and dandy until 'you deserve' a broken ankle.

Show your son some compassion for God's sake.\n\nWhat really grinds my gears is the fact that OP figured that his son would just get over his love for soccer as if it was a generic fad. As a parent you should be supportive of your child's interests no matter what and offer advice when needed.\n\nIf you knew he was kicking dangerous objects around the house then you should've stepped in and bought him a ball and told him to kick that outside instead.\n\nIt also doesn't matter what age he was. You're supposed to be a parent and remind your kids what to do and how to stay safe.\n\nOP is definitely an AH. No doubt in my mind. I'm speaking as a parent myself.", "Yta. Like how would you feel if he did this at school and heard his pe coach reprimand him like that? \n\nHe was in major pain, and already figured out that what he did was asinine. Your job is not just to teach him, it is to parent him. \n\nTeaching him how to not be compassionate is a bully's job. Again, you are the parent!\n\nNow, after the hospital, when his foot is feeling better, it would be fair to remind him this wouldn't have happened if he would just think before he acts!
