It's ABSOLUTELY appropriate to tell Kettle-Bell Pele that his dumbass got exactly what it deserved for ignoring every critical thinking lesson life had provided up to this point.  The word \"dumbass\" is wholly appropriate, and I'm sorry, I don't think we should go out of our way to avoid acknowledging that the kid was a dumbass and did something incredibly stupid and absolutely deserved it.  \n\n\nNo one else made those choices.  It wasn't a trap, it wasn't an accident, it wasn't a weight painted like a soccer ball, no one was egging him on or pressuring him to do it, he thought it'd be fun, he made the idiot-choices every step of the way, he LITERALLY deserves this.  This is a direct consequence of the choices he made, as imposed by the laws of fucking physics and limitations of biology, it's nobody's fault but his, he literally deserved it, he literally earned it, there's nothing wrong with telling him that.    \n\n\nYou people who think nothing is more important than a child's feelings are really undervaluing the critical step of \"learning lessons\" in comparison.  There was one of these the other days, racist kid was the only one not invited to a birthday party and the comments were full of feeling-over-thinking half-wits whining over the poor racists feelings, and forgive me, but that's some shortsighted dumbfuckery.  The LESSON is what matters, the moral, the teachable moment, not their ickle fucking feewings.  Be a racist, get treated poorly, that's a lesson, that's a valuable fucking lesson, and this is the exact same sort of thing.  \n\n\nOh no, you were made to feel stupid for doing something really stupid?  Fucking good, you should feel stupid, you WERE stupid, you did a stupid thing on purpose and as a result you absolutely should feel stupid, grow to hate that feeling, and then make choices that hopefully avoid it going forward.

Yeah, he needed to learn the hard way.", "Jeez. Why didn't you just call him a ret@&d.\n\n Do you think he doesn't know he did something stupid.  We all did at that age.

As a parent you should be supportive of your child's interests no matter what and offer advice when needed.\n\nIf you knew he was kicking dangerous objects around the house then you should've stepped in and bought him a ball and told him to kick that outside instead.\n\nIt also doesn't matter what age he was.

Definitely an issue, needs to be stopped before half the house is demolished.

If they do it anyway, they deserve the outcome. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say the situation doesn\u2019t suck and that the dad shouldn\u2019t feel for his kid.

In all likelihood, he will heal up just fine, and hopefully will learn some responsibility. \n\nI do agree that \u201cdeserve\u201d is kind of a loaded word. No one \u201cdeserves\u201d to die for crossing a street without looking, for instance.

I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around how his love of all things football manifests in this desire to kick objects, that aren\u2019t footballs??? Not encouraging his need to kick non-footballs isn\u2019t unsupportive or sabotaging his career (lol). NTA", "YTA for telling him that he deserved a broken ankle, yes.\n\nHe was being an idiot. Young teens do stupid shit. I grew up during peak Jackass (and worse) popularity, and am honestly bewildered how no one in my town died by the amount of fuckery that was being done.\n\nTelling him that trying to kick a weight as a football is fucking stupid is fine, because it is, and a perfect example of fuck around and find out. Telling a kid who have just broken their ankle (not sure how complicated and long term the damage is by your post) that they deserved it is more opening an almost healed wound and rubbing salt in it for no reason. He (hopefully) already felt stupid, his parent rubbing it in sucks as is, his parent saying you deserve pain and a potentially long term injury for being stupid just doesnt add anything to a lesson and probably hurt more than it helped. \n\nI would also mention, that unless he has developmental delays or similare, a 14yo knows that kicking a weight with enough force to fracture something is stupid, but he still did it. He is bad at the sport according to you, but the other kids are cheering/egging him on, and he does it for them, clowning. Might want to check on why he feels a need to do stupid shit, that he for all intent and purposes knows would harm him, for others attention and approval.", "You are NTA for telling him he was stupid because he was. At fourteen, he has to know kicking a weight is going to hurt. Also, since you warned him not to kick non-footballs, he kind of had it coming. Mild YTA for phrasing it as he deserved it. He doesn\u2019t deserve a broken ankle but he shouldn\u2019t have been an idiot and it is entirely his fault he broke it.", "YTA for two reasons.\n\n1) Never tell someone who just got injured that they\u2019re stupid and deserve it. This won\u2019t accomplish anything and will only make them feel worse.\n\n2) What are you implying when you say that Isaac\u2019s football hobby is causing problems? Also why point out how \u201cbad\u201d he is at it? You sound incredibly unsupportive and should be grateful your son has found an active hobby and not something bad.", "YTA  \nNo one deserves to get hurt!  \nIf you had said that it was expected when you do something so stupid, then it was fine.  \nBut NO ONE deserves to be hurt, beaten or otherwise experience something ugly.  \nChoose your words carefully, it makes a big difference to a child and especially a teenager, whether you use one or the other wording.", "\u201cNatural consequences\u201d is the nicest way to say \u201cplay stupid games, win stupid prizes.\u201d", "nah he did deserve that, he\u2019s 14 and should know better, what did the kid expect was gonna happen.", "This. 100%. YTA", "Would have just asked him what he thought was going to happen.", "The way you broke it down shows clearly the difference between guilt and shame. Guilt is you did something bad (focuses on the behaviour) and shame is you are bad. \n\nThe way you talk to your kid matters, it influences his inner monologue throughout life.", "this is extreme. ashamed? as many fellow parents know: you tell kid not to do stupid thing, they do stupid thing anyway, get hurt, parent goes \u201cwellp. that\u2019s what you get\u201d. or a casual \u201cif you\u2019re gonna be dumb you better be tough!\u201d like this is a common thing. how is what OP said any different?", "Yea... no kid deserves a broken ankle for being a dumbass. Way to gleefully savour the pain of your child, Op.", "This needs to be higher. I rolled my eyes at so many of these comments. I bet the tune would change if it was their own kid, and they had the impending medical bills staring them in the face. Some life lessons really need to be hammered home. If you don't want to get called stupid or hear you got exactly what you deserved, don't do stupid shit.", "He probably does realise but was just being an idiot. My brother\u2019s fourteen and very smart but he does stupid things all the time because he doesn\u2019t think things through. He\u2019d probably kick a weight if somebody dared him to or he was showing off.", "He kicked weight. That the most natural consequence to his actions. Ofc he deserves a broken ankle. Fire burns, water is wet yet again you're not an asshole for pointing it out", "The reason you say things like the Dad did is so it doesn't actually happen again.", "He did something stupid. Was called out on it. Maybe it'll help a teenager think again before doing a different stupid thing. Why would he have to break down WHY kicking a weight is stupid? The kid knew it was dumb before he even swung the leg, but he didn't care. That is why he deserves the broken bone.", "Kid is less likely to do other stupid shit while he heals, Dad is probably glad for that.", "Yeah most clear case of f-around and find out. Yes he did deserve a broken ankle he kicked something heavy and solid, wtf we he thought would happen? Hopefully next he has an impulsive dangerous thought he will think twice. I'm more of a NAH vote mostly because he's a teen with hormones and probably a bit of a bruised ego", "of course he deserved it he 14 and should know better. he was told not to do it and didn\u2019t listen. \nAnd kicking a weight of all things is stupid, as they say play stupid games win stupid prizes.", "Eh, I could definitely picture the 13 year old in my neighborhood doing this. He's, um, not a thinker when nobody's reminding him to think. He's not stupid but he's not going to be winning a 'good decisions' prize any time soon. And he will do anything to look 'cool' if anyone near his age is around. He just started soccer this year too... I know he's definitely not OP's kid though lol.", "> Did he miss the window where he could potentially get scouted or whatever happens to soccer players?\n\nIf he's only beginning at 14, then yes.\n\nI mean, sure, those \u201cwindows\u201d pop up all the time, or maybe it's a single continuous one... But either way, that begins at six or so. Not o'clock in the morning or evening, but years of age. Starting at 14, you'll never catch up to the kids who started at four and already have 10,000 hours under their belt at 14.", ">What's wrong with letting Isaac have a hobby he enjoys for as long as he's enjoying it?\n\nWhat's wrong is that you left out the end of that sentence.\n\n>maybe he should let this football/soccer thing die down a bit and find a new hobby **until his ankle was healed**\n\nOP is worried the future Darwin-award-winner is gonna try something similar on a broken ankle and disable himself for life.", "He clearly doesn't like his child much if at all.", "I tried to see if a fryingpan was warm by touching with my hand, full flat. \n\nLuckily it wasn\u2019t. Shamefully I was 26 at the time. \n\nWe all have moment of \u201cwe should know better, but didn\u2019t\u201d. Some have bigger consequences then others, but to say to somebody they deserve it is wrong. \n\nOP is YTA for that part.", "Do you know failarmy on YouTube?", "Kids in their teens are actually less adept at making sound decisions than pre-teens. Their brain is basically being rewired in preparation for adulthood, and that results in a somewhat reduced capability for, well, survival.", ">Or just not that bright.\n\nI mean he did kick a weight with enough force to break his ankle so definitely a bit dim.", "Way too old to kick a weight like a soccer ball.  That\u2019s Darwin shit right there.", "For real. And one of our kids was dumb enough to need stitches to the noggin when he tried to bust a basketball... with a sledgehammer. Another shot himself in the foot. With a bow and arrow. But intentionally kicking a weight is so absurd I honestly kinda question the veracity of this post.", "I'm 48.\n\nThe young man is an idiot whose injury is a well-deserved consequence of his own stupidity.\n\nHe deserved it for not using one iota of brain power to think his actions through, especially since he'd repeatedly been told not to kick things that aren't balls - which should be glaringly obvious to a 14 year old.\n\nHe's not 10.", "Depending on the area there should be a rec team at each high school. I played on one all through the upper grades and we sucked every year. That was why we were in the rec league and not on the school team. Some of the girls even dropped the school team due to the time commitment to slum it with us lol.\n\nTriggered tf out of my dad who was the only non-athletic brother growing up and couldn't understand why I was okay with sucking lol.", "And also still currently a thing, wasn't there a new movie last year? People do dumb shit. All the time.", "I agree she is ass for saying he had it coming.", "Denotation vs connotation", "That is a popular saying in my family.
