It's ABSOLUTELY appropriate to tell Kettle-Bell Pele that his dumbass got exactly what it deserved for ignoring every critical thinking lesson life had provided up to this point.  The word \"dumbass\" is wholly appropriate, and I'm sorry, I don't think we should go out of our way to avoid acknowledging that the kid was a dumbass and did something incredibly stupid and absolutely deserved it.  \n\n\nNo one else made those choices.  It wasn't a trap, it wasn't an accident, it wasn't a weight painted like a soccer ball, no one was egging him on or pressuring him to do it, he thought it'd be fun, he made the idiot-choices every step of the way, he LITERALLY deserves this.  This is a direct consequence of the choices he made, as imposed by the laws of fucking physics and limitations of biology, it's nobody's fault but his, he literally deserved it, he literally earned it, there's nothing wrong with telling him that.    \n\n\nYou people who think nothing is more important than a child's feelings are really undervaluing the critical step of \"learning lessons\" in comparison.  There was one of these the other days, racist kid was the only one not invited to a birthday party and the comments were full of feeling-over-thinking half-wits whining over the poor racists feelings, and forgive me, but that's some shortsighted dumbfuckery.  The LESSON is what matters, the moral, the teachable moment, not their ickle fucking feewings.  Be a racist, get treated poorly, that's a lesson, that's a valuable fucking lesson, and this is the exact same sort of thing.  \n\n\nOh no, you were made to feel stupid for doing something really stupid?  Fucking good, you should feel stupid, you WERE stupid, you did a stupid thing on purpose and as a result you absolutely should feel stupid, grow to hate that feeling, and then make choices that hopefully avoid it going forward.

Yeah, he needed to learn the hard way.", "Jeez. Why didn't you just call him a ret@&d.\n\n Do you think he doesn't know he did something stupid.  We all did at that age.

As a parent you should be supportive of your child's interests no matter what and offer advice when needed.\n\nIf you knew he was kicking dangerous objects around the house then you should've stepped in and bought him a ball and told him to kick that outside instead.\n\nIt also doesn't matter what age he was.

You\u2019re supposed to be one of the people on this planet that believes in him no matter what. You pushing him to get a new hobby validated what he was feeling.  Do you go to his games or practices? Are you enthusiastic while there? Do you treat his football as an inconvenience when you have to take him to games or practices? Are you maybe using this as a way to soft sell not being on a team this spring? There\u2019s a lot he can learn and grow from even on the sidelines.  If he doesn\u2019t have the physical gifts to play; maybe this time injured will introduce him to being a coach. There are ways to participate in football without being on the field.  Do you watch games together on tv? Maybe start.  Go to a college, pro or semipro game just the two of you.  Start trying with your kid.", "This kids is 14! NTA", "NTA\nI\u2019m sorry\u2026but if at 14 years old you think kicking a weight is a good idea\u2026then you kinda DO deserve the broken ankle.\nGoing to venture a guess he won\u2019t try that again\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "ESH/NTA- man some of you guys are not first generation Americans and it shows lol. As my mom would say, \"ya ves? Por pendejo.\" Hopefully you used his college fund to pay for the hospital bill lol, he might not need it in the end \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Yeah saying he deserved it is messed up but if that causes him \"trauma\" then he needs help lol. People are like oh he's just 14. Nah dude, like some critical thinking skills should've already appeared by then lol", "YTA. Poor choice in words.", "YTA, never tell a kid they deserve a possibly life altering injury!!!", "Yta", "At first I thought they were little kids and thought it was messed up you said that. But this is a 14 year old. Wtf did he think was gonna happen.", "Possibly your choice of the word deserved was unwise. I\u2019d personally take this as a teachable moment. The part of the brain responsible for impulse control and long-term perspective taking isn\u2019t fully developed in teenagers. This is why your kid decided to do something that was obviously a bad idea.\n\n\u201che blamed me for not believing in him and wanting to sabotage his career\u201d is a concerning comment given that you seem very dismissive of his skills. He clearly knows this. Does it actually matter whether he is any good? What kind of \u201cproblems\u201d is him playing ball with his siblings causing? Aside from the ankle. Many parents would be ecstatic to have their 14yo boy being active instead of playing video games.\n\nAre you usually supportive of your son\u2019s interests? \n\nI think YTA but not because you were hard on him about stupidly kicking weights. The lesson you seem to think he should learn is not about exercising judgement over unwise things to kick but about not doing something he enjoys.\n\nYou don\u2019t sound supportive to me at all.", "NTA,Ike the old saying goes and you basically said it. That way he learns", "YTA. Why would you say that to your kid?? Regardless of what he did he is a kid and if you say things like that they will stick with him.", "Not ashamed to admit I also tried kicking a weight and fucking up my toe as a kid.", "Yeah, those words are the only poor choice here. But it seems like the kid is not willing to respond to any reasonable advice. How is his dad \u201csabotaging his career\u201d by telling him that kicking weights is fucking stupid? This is the kind of behavior I would expect from like, a 3 year old, not a teen. \n\n\nI hurt myself doing stupid shit a few times when I was a kid. My parents took care of the injury and then told me \u201cthat was stupid, and this is what happens when you do stupid stuff like that. Be careful in the future.\u201d As a parent, you are responsible for making sure your child knows not to do stupid shit. This entails correcting them when they do shit that is stupid. \n\n\nBut honestly, I think the kid does deserve a broken ankle. (Though I\u2019m not sure I would have the heart to say that to my own child.) 14 is WAY too old to be kicking a fucking dumbbell like a football. Unless he has some sort of mental issue, that is.", "That\u2019s the thing though. Teaching to assume the consequences of one\u2019s decisions is wildly different from saying someone deserves to be injured. If a kid doesn\u2019t look both ways before crossing a street, does he _deserve_ to be hit by a car and possibly die? Too extreme? Who draws the line as to how much maiming a child deserves for a stupid decision?", "Deserved is this wrong word. \u201cEarned\u201d is probably what she meant. \n\nIts a \u201cactions have consequences\u201d situation.", "he\u2019s fucking fourteen. anybody should know not to kick a weight.", "A kid needs to learn when he deserves stuff, too.  I have a nephew that did almost the same thing and we just assumed he was thick until he started making stuff in Meinkraft.\n\nWould you let the kid grow up, get thrown in jail and then tell him \"oh sweetie it's not your fault\"?  14???  Almost a man.", "I agree with your judgement for slightly different reasons. Being unable to unpack the subtle but important differences between \"this was 100% your own fault, due to actions you took that were objectively stupid\" and \"you deserved the bad thing that happened to you because of your bad choices\" is not great, but in the face of a kid thinking you can kick a heavy metal object full force because \"hurr bdurr I'm Messi,\" I can see how a parent might make a snap response out of frustration.\n\nWhat really convinces me that OP is bordering on outright malicious is the fact that he's so focused on Isaac being bad at his hobby, and apparently being willing to use any possible excuse to try and convince him to give up on something he enjoys because OP doesn't think he's met some arbitrary minimum level of skill at it. Instead of being there for his son who is suffering from a painful, serious injury, albeit only after calming down from snapping something not entirely fair at him, he's immediately trying to leverage this situation to be the hobby police.", "Agreed, YTA", "Time and a place, I guess. If that\u2019s outside and not causing damage (like, can\u2019t aim, kicking hard, broken every window in the house rather than take some power out until the accuracy is up) then that\u2019s not an issue and trying to stop it is an AH move.\n\nSoccer inside the house? Definitely an issue, needs to be stopped before half the house is demolished. Given the kid was injured trying to play inside, it feels like a reasonable assumption that at least some portion is indoors, so I can see OPs frustration/issue with that specific element.", "This whole entire time I'm wondering why his son is kicking random objects and why OP is not complaining about soccer ball being kicked around the house. Did OP not buy the kid a ball?", "What do you think \"deserve\" means? To means it means \"appropriate given your actions\" and doing something with a highly likely outcome and then getting that outcome seems \"deserved\".", "You deserve the direct and foreseeable consequences of your actions, yes. \n\nIf a three year old kicks a dumbbell, they are probably too little to predict that they will get hurt. They don\u2019t deserve a broken ankle. \n\nA 14 year old is fully capable of understanding the likely consequences of kicking a weight at full force. If they do it anyway, they deserve the outcome. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say the situation doesn\u2019t suck and that the dad shouldn\u2019t feel for his kid. But in this case, the consequences were 100% foreseeable and the only person responsible for the outcome was the kid. So I\u2019m fine with saying he \u201cdeserves\u201d the outcome. It will suck for a while but the kid seems like a brat and needs to be taken down a notch. In all likelihood, he will heal up just fine, and hopefully will learn some responsibility. \n\nI do agree that \u201cdeserve\u201d is kind of a loaded word. No one \u201cdeserves\u201d to die for crossing a street without looking, for instance. But if they do get hit, you can\u2019t say that the responsibility isn\u2019t at least partially theirs (assuming they have the mental capacity to understand that crossing the street is dangerous). In lower stakes situations where the consequences aren\u2019t permanent injury or death, I have no qualms using the word.", "If they meant earned, they would have said earned. They didn\u2019t.", "Sure, that doesn\u2019t mean he deserved to be hurt. Re-evaluate your moral compass.", "Expect =! Deserve.\n\nRe-evaluate your moral compass, kid.", "When you\u2019re 14, it\u2019s hard to actually get on a team if you suck. If you\u2019re under 10 you can definitely get in a participation trophy type league, but once you\u2019re a teen the options are limited if you\u2019re not going into a competitive league. That said, OP should be encouraging him to find friends to play casually or see if he can find a neighborhood intramural group to tag along with.", "I can't decide if you mean to agree with me or not lol\n\nBut what you're saying is the point I'm making, don't down play his passion if he loves it", "Idk, a lot of 14 year olds are still in the phase of, \"I wonder if I can?\" and not, \"what happens if I do?\"", "I did as a kid, I think my logic went like this \"I can lift this weight easily, wonder how far I can throw it?\"  And then I tried kicking it.  Luckily only bruised my toe.", "Not necessarily. \n\nTypos exist. \n\nUsing the wrong words exists. \n\nIts not a stretch to think she simply used the wrong word. \n\nMost sane parents done want to see their kids in pain. But there is situations where \u201ckids will be kids.\u201d\n\nI cant count the amount of scars, or scratches i got as a kid. My parents telling me not to jump on a couch like a trampoline- my foot slipped into the cracks and collided with metal springs; and it took a big chuck out of my toe.\n\nTo this day, 15+ years later, i have a rectangle scar on my toe. And yes, i earned it by not listening.", "Yeah, like\u2026 really? If you try to kick weights, you deserve whatever consequences happen for that level of stupidity. If this was a little kid, it would be one thing, but 14 is WAY too old to think that this was in any way, shape or form a good idea. I hope he makes a full and fast recovery and learns from this, but this was SUCH a dumb thing to do that the natural consequences ARE deserved. It\u2019s a harsh thing to say to your injured kid, sure, but it\u2019s also the harsh reality of life and if a kid reaches 14 without realising that booting weights is a fucking terrible idea, giving that concept some harsh reinforcement might not be a bad idea. \n\nBetter harsh words than more broken bones and eventually permanent damage. Do this type of shit enough times and this kid is going to end up struggling to walk let alone play football.", "I had a friend who\u2019s older brother gave himself a concussion hitting himself in the head (on purpose) with a metal baseball bat. Tbh it was a big joke between us and we probably said repeatedly that he deserved it. It\u2019s a bit different coming from a parent I guess. I guess he should have said \u201cwell what did you expect to happen?\u201d which would make the same point.", "If you\u2019re gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough :)", "If you've raised a 14-year-old who's dumb enough to kick a weight... well, I can't write more here for fear of being banned", "If you\u2019re gonna be dumb then you gotta be tough \ud83d\udc4d", "anyone that kicks a weight knowing damn well what\u2019s going to happen deserved to be hurt. how do you kick a weight and expect to not get hurt?", "Like I say if a kid acts thick and you don't tell him so, you do him a disservice.", "have you ever broken a bone doing something stupid? it\u2019s one of life\u2019s greatest lessons. quick spoiler - he\u2019s going to be *perfectly fine*", "People deserve the consequences of their own actions so long as they reasonably could have been expected to foresee those consequences.\n\nHe was warned not to do it and 14 is absolutely old enough to know that kicking heavy things will hurt you. \n\nSo yeah, kid deserves to deal with the problem they created.", "I mean, at 12 my friend and I were, um, advanced enough to be asking \"what happens if I do,\" but as we were wondering \"what happens if I use this staple gun on my finger\" and promptly decided to find out, I'm gonna say it's not necessarily a better question to be asking!", "Yeah I agree.  YTA for that.\n\nBut this kid.  He is a bit of a moron.  I almost spilled my tea when he said he was 14.    I was guessing YTA and 6.", "Expect =!
