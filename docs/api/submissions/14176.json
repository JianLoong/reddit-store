It's ABSOLUTELY appropriate to tell Kettle-Bell Pele that his dumbass got exactly what it deserved for ignoring every critical thinking lesson life had provided up to this point.  The word \"dumbass\" is wholly appropriate, and I'm sorry, I don't think we should go out of our way to avoid acknowledging that the kid was a dumbass and did something incredibly stupid and absolutely deserved it.  \n\n\nNo one else made those choices.  It wasn't a trap, it wasn't an accident, it wasn't a weight painted like a soccer ball, no one was egging him on or pressuring him to do it, he thought it'd be fun, he made the idiot-choices every step of the way, he LITERALLY deserves this.  This is a direct consequence of the choices he made, as imposed by the laws of fucking physics and limitations of biology, it's nobody's fault but his, he literally deserved it, he literally earned it, there's nothing wrong with telling him that.    \n\n\nYou people who think nothing is more important than a child's feelings are really undervaluing the critical step of \"learning lessons\" in comparison.  There was one of these the other days, racist kid was the only one not invited to a birthday party and the comments were full of feeling-over-thinking half-wits whining over the poor racists feelings, and forgive me, but that's some shortsighted dumbfuckery.  The LESSON is what matters, the moral, the teachable moment, not their ickle fucking feewings.  Be a racist, get treated poorly, that's a lesson, that's a valuable fucking lesson, and this is the exact same sort of thing.  \n\n\nOh no, you were made to feel stupid for doing something really stupid?  Fucking good, you should feel stupid, you WERE stupid, you did a stupid thing on purpose and as a result you absolutely should feel stupid, grow to hate that feeling, and then make choices that hopefully avoid it going forward.  That's the point!  That's the entire learning process!

Yeah, he needed to learn the hard way.", "Jeez. Why didn't you just call him a ret@&d.\n\n Do you think he doesn't know he did something stupid.  We all did at that age.

As a parent you should be supportive of your child's interests no matter what and offer advice when needed.\n\nIf you knew he was kicking dangerous objects around the house then you should've stepped in and bought him a ball and told him to kick that outside instead.\n\nIt also doesn't matter what age he was.

Definitely an issue, needs to be stopped before half the house is demolished.

If they do it anyway, they deserve the outcome. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say the situation doesn\u2019t suck and that the dad shouldn\u2019t feel for his kid. But in this case, the consequences were 100% foreseeable and the only person responsible for the outcome was the kid. So I\u2019m fine with saying he \u201cdeserves\u201d the outcome.

In all likelihood, he will heal up just fine, and hopefully will learn some responsibility. \n\nI do agree that \u201cdeserve\u201d is kind of a loaded word. No one \u201cdeserves\u201d to die for crossing a street without looking, for instance.

I still hate my parents for times when I was suffering and they prioritized letting me know that they were right and I was wrong. Extremely insensitive. You'll drive your kids away.\n\nAlso... There's nothing in this world that one can't get good at with practice. Maybe your son will too. And even if he doesn't, he deserves to have a hobby that makes him feel good.

They aren\u2019t. \n\nConsequences of one\u2019s decisions and actions are a cause to effect issue. You teach your child to take responsibility for them. \n\n_Deserve_ has a _moral_ connotation. You _judge_ that a consequence is a _punishment_ that is morally deserved for said decisions or actions. Ex. Perhaps Chris Rock _deserved_ to be slapped by Will Smith, because his bullying of Jada was morally reprehensible, so in the balance of things, some people feel the slap was _morally deserved_. You scam thousands of people out of their money? You _deserve_ a higher sentence. It\u2019s a subjective, moral judgement that goes beyond natural cause to effect. \n\nThe kid wasn\u2019t trying to cause destruction. He wasn\u2019t trying to hurt someone else. He just made a short-sighted decision that was _morally neutral_. Saying he morally deserves to have a broken ankle for a morally neutral mistake is telling him that it was a failure of his character, and not just some dumb kid shit, which is something _really loaded_ to tell a 14yo.

I've never gotten a wrong answer. Basically they will tell me that the football starts rolling and that if you kick a bowling ball you end up on the ground crying in pain, possibly with broken bones. So I'm pretty sure this kid knew that it does hurt, he'd just not expected it to hurt this much. \n\nMy biggest concern is the other two kids egging him on. That's a sure fire way to make a teenager do stupid stuff. So I'd also have a talk with the other two and hold them accountable too. If they had not been encouraging him to do stupid stuff, he probably would not have done something this stupid.", "Idk, some kids just don\u2019t get it, regardless of who their parents are.", "Yup, like don't dance on a unsteady cheap table while drunk.

Is the broken ankle a completely unfair and mean-spirited consequence to an innocent act? No, it's a direct result of the choices he knowingly made. There's nothing about having a broken ankle because he chose to kick a weight he'd been told not to kick at fourteen years of age that makes the broken ankle unfair. It's not like OP saw the son doing something, got off unharmed, and then broke his ankle as punishment for doing something he told him not to because OP thinks he deserved the punishment. This is OP basically saying 'well yeah, that's a natural consequence of the actions you took, what do you expect?'\n\nHowever, I don't think OP should show some sympathy towards his son's situation and obviously should help take care of him while he's healing. I also agree with you that having another  conversation about his behaviour would be a good way to go."]}
