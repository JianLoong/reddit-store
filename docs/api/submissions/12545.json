She's well within her rights to go no contact over this. \n\nYou seem to doubt what she's said about her ex but if she's telling the truth, it's emotional abuse where you put your feelings over hers in a pretty serious situation and expect her to just be ok with that. Also, frankly it's really important whether or not he has much more money and/or connections than she does. Winning the case isn't necessarily the whole story. Some emotionally abusive people are *real* nice and convincing with everyone but their target.\n\n-Edit. I'm not debating anymore.

Abusers are very good at making their victims seem like the \"crazy\" and abusive ones.\n\nYour daughter had asked you, as her parents, for a boundary so that she feels safe coming to your house.

She might worrying about what seemingly innocuous things you could pass on to him if you're in contact with him which could allow him to harass or stalk her.\n\nIf she feels she can't feel safe at your home if you're in contact with him, then she gets to assert a boundary of going low or no contact with you.\n\nDoing so doesn't make her an asshole.", "YTA.

You should be supporting her more than her ex, and at the very least shouldn't blindside her with deals secretly made with her ex. I think if she feels betrayed, then there is a reason for it.

And I certainly have no way of knowing who is telling the truth - your daughter or your former SIL.\n\nBut if a mother came here and listed all the ways her ex emotionally abused her, then used the court system to lie and take her kids from her, and then asked if she was the AH for being upset when her parents chose to host her ex for the week, people would be on her side.  \n\n**If you TRULY believed your daughter, and all the things she has said about her ex, you would not be hosting your former SIL.

Your daughter\u2019s actions only highlight why she doesn\u2019t have custody. You just keep being stellar grandparents and the grands will keep coming around.", "NTA & great grand parenting!", "NTA. My fathers mother and my mother were EXTREMELY bitter toward each other after my parents separated, it really created a lot of childhood issues for me I still deal with today. Props to you for dealing with both sides so maturely while keeping the kids best interest first.", "Grandparents have rights too, in case you aren\u2019t up to speed on California custody rights, some Grandparents ask the court to grant you time with the grandkids, if circumstances change, and you can no longer/don\u2019t want to work it out with their dad on your own, know that you can talk to a family lawyer about this. You may already know this or not find it helpful, but I mention it just in case that\u2019s news.", "Jumping on top comment to say if the daughter does keep the kids away, OP can speak to a lawyer about grandparents rights. They have an established relationship with their grandkids, they deserve to be able to maintain that relationship. NTA OP", "I don\u2019t think grandparents rights would apply in a situation where one parent is still allowing them access to the grandchildren (even if it\u2019s not the parent they\u2019re related to).  They\u2019re not being cut off altogether.", "OP stated that the daughters has a history of lying about people beyond just her ex, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re just blindly taking his word without context.", "NTA\n\nI had a SIL like that. I was at my IL's home as much as I could because they were (a) extremely accepting of me and the boys even after the divorce, (b) they loved me as a daughter and told me that often, (c) my boys absolutely loved them with their entire beings.\n\nMy oldest would follow grandpa around like his shadow. Working on the garden, shoveling snow, working on the car, etc.\n\nMy youngest had to be around grandma who taught him how to measure and how to cook.\n\nBoth children loved both grandparents but revolved completely around one. My boys thrived and learned so much. They were welcomed and loved so completely that my heart would sing as I watched them being loved on and loving in return.\n\nEdit to include vote.", "The one trying to dictate clothing is the toxic person here, not the sister", "I completely agree!! I swear i come here just for the memories people share, memories like these, that warm my heart and remind me of all the things I truly believe I had forgotten. \u2764", "Without seeing the outfit, no we can\u2019t confirm that. Based on what\u2019s posted here she very well could have been dressed like trash going to a nice event. She doesn\u2019t exactly come across as someone who is responsible or have any kind of common sense. If my partner was dressed inappropriately I would certainly say something", "Dad doesn't need to be there though", "Because she's their daughter and we don't know the full story here, maybe there's a legit reason why she hates him. The guy is their daughters ex, they shouldn't be choosing him over her unless she's done some crazy abusive shit", "There's a thing called reactive abuse where the abuser needles and provokes the victim into reacting emotionally and then uses their reactions against them. \n\nThrowing stuff at anyone is not okay, but figuring out who is abusing who is not always simple.", "Then you'd be the controlling ahole. Let people dress themselves lol", "So what the OP said the daughter has done doesn\u2019t qualify as crazy abusive?"]}
