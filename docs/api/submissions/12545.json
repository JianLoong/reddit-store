She's well within her rights to go no contact over this. \n\nYou seem to doubt what she's said about her ex but if she's telling the truth, it's emotional abuse where you put your feelings over hers in a pretty serious situation and expect her to just be ok with that. Also, frankly it's really important whether or not he has much more money and/or connections than she does. Winning the case isn't necessarily the whole story. Some emotionally abusive people are *real* nice and convincing with everyone but their target.", "NTA. Your daughter is being unreasonable.

Abusers are very good at making their victims seem like the \"crazy\" and abusive ones.\n\nYour daughter had asked you, as her parents, for a boundary so that she feels safe coming to your house.

She might worrying about what seemingly innocuous things you could pass on to him if you're in contact with him which could allow him to harass or stalk her.\n\nIf she feels she can't feel safe at your home if you're in contact with him, then she gets to assert a boundary of going low or no contact with you.\n\nDoing so doesn't make her an asshole.", "YTA.

You should be supporting her more than her ex, and at the very least shouldn't blindside her with deals secretly made with her ex. I think if she feels betrayed, then there is a reason for it.

And I certainly have no way of knowing who is telling the truth - your daughter or your former SIL.\n\nBut if a mother came here and listed all the ways her ex emotionally abused her, then used the court system to lie and take her kids from her, and then asked if she was the AH for being upset when her parents chose to host her ex for the week, people would be on her side.  \n\n**If you TRULY believed your daughter, and all the things she has said about her ex, you would not be hosting your former SIL.
