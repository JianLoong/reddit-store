It seems that you had good intentions and just wanted to spend time with your grandchildren. You weren't trying to take sides in the divorce or condone any bad behavior. It is understandable that your daughter may be upset, but it is ultimately up to her to decide how she wants to handle her relationship with you. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your daughter to try to understand her perspective and find a way to move forward.", "NTA. I'm sorry she's being so ridiculous that she can't be happy the grands want to spend time with you.", "nta, unless your daughter has full custody, her kids need their father in their lives, even if its only half the time.", "NTA you daughter is being petty and spiteful, she is trying to emotionally blackmail you. Her comments to you show a complete lack of maturity, shows no true understanding, when it comes to her children's needs. I am so sorry you have to put up with this, childish spiteful behaviour", "NTA \n\nThe way your daughter is reacting kind of explains the loss of custody, sorry to say.", "YTA. Per another response your daughter has said her ex was emotionally abusive. You allowing him to stay in your house means you either don't believe her or think not seeing your grandkids is worse than supporting someone who's emotionally abusive with a free stay. She's well within her rights to go no contact over this. \n\nYou seem to doubt what she's said about her ex but if she's telling the truth, it's emotional abuse where you put your feelings over hers in a pretty serious situation and expect her to just be ok with that. Also, frankly it's really important whether or not he has much more money and/or connections than she does. Winning the case isn't necessarily the whole story. Some emotionally abusive people are *real* nice and convincing with everyone but their target.", "NTA. Your daughter is being unreasonable. You should be able to see your grandchildren whenever you want, and she should be happy that they get to spend time with you.", "NTA Your daughter is consumed with hatred. If she choses to be bitter and penalize people for acting in the best interests of the children, you can't do much about it. Your grandchildren know you love them and always will and nothing your daughter says or does will change it. You will always have a realtionship with them because your former son in law knows you're only concern is what is in the best interests of your grandchildren.", "NTA - Respectfully the only AH here is your daughter. She is being petty and if she is that small minded to cut you off for wanting time with grandkids then I'm not surprised ex got primary....", "NYA. Your daughter is being unreasonable and petty.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nYour daughter needs to realise that this is not about her. And the universe does not revolve around her. This is about you getting to spend time with your grandkids which she should actually cherish.", "NTA, and I'm sorry you have to deal with this garbage from your own daughter.", "NTA. Your daughter has some growing up to do.", "info: what did the ex-husband do? it seems important enough here for her to bring up that you know \"all the bad things\" he's done, but you never specify what she accuses him of. Especially if it's related to negligence, abuse, violence, anger, etc.", "NTA\n\nGirl went from 0 to 100 right quick. Your goals are simple: You just want to see the kids. She's letting her (tad bit overwhelming) hate overtake any kind of logic.\n\nYour house, you can let whoever you please in. If daughter wants to isolate herself because she doesn't like it that's her choice. For your intentions it's good the dad has primary custody.", "INFO: What bad things has the ex done that she believes this is condoning?\n\nBecause right now I'm leaning NTA and your daughter is being petty.", "NTA\n\nAnd your daughter wonders why she doesn\u2019t have primary custody. She needs to grow up and learn how to coparent effectively for the kids. Whatever issues she has with her ex, has nothing to do with the children.", "NTA. I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but if your daughter was a better mother she would have more custody and she sounds bitter she didn't get it. Is she dependent on you in any way? Because if she is threatening to go NC, it might be time to amend the will.", "NTA. I'm sorry but your daughter sounds toxic af. The fact that the judge gave him primary custody speaks volumes.\n\nHaving a good relationship with him means you're behaving #1 as adults and #2 in the best interest of your grandchildren.  Your daughter can't or purposefully won't see that.\n\nThe only bad message being sent here is from her. I'm really sorry you're going through this.", "NTA. You have to do a lot of lying about important shit (like falsely accusing dad of sexual abuse level shit) for dishonesty to have a role in custody decisions. Non-compliance sounds like a mix ignoring custody terms and contempt of court to me. Your daughter can both grow up and kick rocks.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is a piece of... *work*, based on the info you've provided.", "NTA: your daughter is being selfish", "Your daughter cares more about proving her ex wrong than loving and caring for her kids. Thank god she doesnt have custody.", "What bad things has the ex done? I feel like that's super important here", "Both parties claim emotional abuse. There was a police report against her for throwing an object at him. She currently states that he torments her nonstop but we have not heard this until now and, honestly, find it hard to believe. She truly believes her ex put the kids up to this in order to \"get to her\".   He has never said a bad word about her in our presence. The parenting evaluation also said he did not bad mouth her to children but she did bad mouth him. \n\nI am her father's 2nd wife but have been her mother for 20+ years.", "Exactly. Withholding the kids out of spite clearly shows she does not put the children or their best interest first.", "This was the first we heard that he's done bad things. We have heard her complain that he is uncooperative about her making last minute changes to custody pickups/dropoffs.", "Well, if we're going to disallow anyone with an ex from staying in our homes, I guess we'll just have to start building more hotels.", "Seeing as the father got custody, whatever he did was probably a drop in the bucket compared to what she did...", "He is very strict about rules. He did say insulting things when they were married. Things like \"do you have to be so vulgar\" or \"could you at least TRY to dress nice for this event?\"  He would openly disagree with her which always makes her very angry. I always tried to gently sway her instead of directly disagreeing. \n\nWhile married, he seemed to avoid us as if we were bad people. She would tell us that he hated us and looked down on us. I now think he was being told similar things.", "She sounds like a toxic nightmare!", "What are you even talking about?", "That's what I'm thinking. I mean, the judge ruled against her, citing her dishonesty as part of the reason.", "Honestly, if he doesn't have to stay in your house then it might be best all round if he doesn't."]}
