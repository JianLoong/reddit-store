{"id": 21048, "submission_id": "14nuhcf", "title": "AITA for telling my SIL that she is fucking annoying?", "selftext": "My SIL has been staying with my husband and I for the past month, after being evicted. She says they sold the building she was living in. I have no reason to not believe her. She works nights. My husband and I work days. We also have a son with ADHD and he is currently unmedicated because they haven't completely finished the evaluation. \n\nSo, SIL sleeps from 6am when she gets home until 2-4pm, around the time my husband and I pick up our son from daycare and get home from work. My SIL is the type that needs to make comments about everything. But it's not in the typical \"I'm trying to start a conversation\" sense. She is just constantly repeating what she just saw/heard. So every day she will come downstairs and say things like \"I just woke up and came down and here you are with Christopher and he is in a bad mood and I don't know why\" (Christopher is my son). Or \"I just went to make coffee and noticed there's no cups and I thought maybe I should do the dishes\". Or \"My alarm went off so I came down and didn't know you guys would be home already but here you are.\" Or \"I was going to get leftovers because I just woke up but then I noticed you sitting right here and you look angry so I wanted to be a good SIL and sit with you first\". And trust me, I know she very well could be just.. idk.. socially awkward or something but these types of things are the only things she ever says. It's literally just her talking about things she sees or hears. Stuff I already know because I'm always in the same room and see/hear the same thing she does so it's like I'm dealing with the same issue twice, 30+ times a day. \n\nWell, for the past week when I've gotten home I've asked her specifically to give me space. I've told her multiple times I don't want to talk. That I need to be alone, etc. So yesterday, I told her again that I just wanted quiet time and didn't want to talk and her immediate reaction to this was \"I just got up and came downstairs and you're in a bad mood and I don't know why and it's confusing me\". I admittedly kind of snapped at this moment because she truly just refuses to leave me alone with these comments so I said \"maybe it's because I've asked you to leave me alone several times so I can have space alone but you refuse because you're fucking annoying. I'm fully aware of what you walked in to. I'm the one in here. I don't need a play by play on shit I already know.\" MIL says I'm an AH (she told her) because my SIL has issues (schizophrenia and narcissistic personality disorder).

Huh. I would have assumed something on the spectrum from her habit of describing what going on. Maybe that's a schizophrenia management trick.\n\nTaking in someone who has mental illnesses and not knowing how to relate to them in a way that preserves your peace of mind is not an AH move. And anyone can snap after repeated clashes.\n\nI'm no expert,  but I've found saying something like, \"I want you to not talk to me for the next 2 hours because I'm stressed. Can you do that?\" or, \"I'm going to work here alone so please get what you need now and then avoid this room till I have finished\".\n\nWhich would be pretty rude to a NT person, but can actually work a lot better for someone on the spectrum who has failed to understand your requests for several months.\n\nIf she understands but just doesn't want to accommodate your requirements ... well that might be the NPD. And you probably need to get timeline from your husband how long she's staying, because living with narcissistic people can be painful.\n\nNAH", "LMFAO\n\nYou let her have it!! Hot DAMN!! \n\nBe TA moment!\n\nYes you are, proudly so as it should be! she sounds annoying, but perhaps it's her coping mechanisms. And not actual malice of trying to get under your skin.\n\nVery relatable to me, I back you up.", "It doesn\u2019t matter what condition she may or may not have. What matters is that you made a boundary and you made it crystal clear. Your SIL broke the boundary and argued against the boundary. You don\u2019t need to have a condition to be an asshole. \n\nBoundaries are made so we get our needs met. They also help us to work out who gets access to our energy and who does not. If you make a boundary and someone accepts that without question then they are the people you keep in your life. If you make a boundary and someone argues against it, asks for a justification, apology, a defence or an explanation then they are the ones who we distance ourselves from. \n\nYou\u2019re doing your SIL a huge favour. She should be indebted to you and doing everything she can to show her gratitude toward you. This is the opposite of that. \n\nThe only thing I would say, that you need to consider, is that you shouldn\u2019t have got into an argument with her or any kind of conflict. You should have just repeated your boundary. Again and again until it sank home. Although, I have a feeling that even a battleship wouldn\u2019t have sunk home with your SIL. \n\nThis arrangement  isn\u2019t going to work out. You know that don\u2019t you. Time for your husband to step in and tell her to go. \n\nNTA.", "Has she actually been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder?", "It sounds like she was taught to communicate that way for herself and those around her. At first I thought it was just passive aggression but it seems to be a technique she was taught from therapy or something\u2026?

It sounds like she\u2019s trying to be open and honest but really she should be living alone.", "You need to have her move out.  She\u2019s going to drive you crazy.  NTA but, also, she needs to go.", "Minor ESH - This is just the joy of living with people. She has social issues, and you clearly find them annoying. Fairly standard thing. Guess everyone needs to suck it up until she is able to find somewhere else to live. \nYour response was a little rude, but you were clear with her to give you space, and it would only be a matter of time until you reacted like that.", "NTA\nSometimes you need to call a Spade, spade.\nBut her behaviour also sounds like Autism spectrum. Is she taking her meds??", "You were shit to her, so yes you\u2019re the asshole. She\u2019s trying to make conversation, she may well already know that but people find her annoying or socially awkward. You should not have been so mean as to point it out.", "YTA for snapping.\n\nIn the sense that you already know that she has mental issues.  But at the same time this is your residence, and you are entitled to some peace and quiet.  Totally get that it can be annoying.  It's a hard position to be in.  But ultimately, you know she is not being malicious or anything, just annoying.  And it's her way of trying to connect with the world.  \n\nBest solution might be to help her find a new place.\n\nBut I would apologize to her (even if she is annoying to you) because you can't really fault her for being neurodivergent and that's the way she talks.", "YTA\n\nShe is diagnosed with mental illness, she is not going to understand social situations the way you do.\n\nShe is not doing or saying anything mean, just trying to make conversation with you when you are in the same house together.\n\nYou didn\u00b4t have to be mean to her because she couldn\u00b4t understand why you didn\u00b4t want to talk to her. She literally doesn\u00b4t understand. \n\nI can see that it would be annoying to you but you could cut her some slack based on both her illness and her lack of malice.", "YTA - you know she has a mental health condition. Snapping at people like this does NO good. It's like yelling at a young child or someone with downs syndrome.\n\nThey only process the aggression, and feel hurt and scared - but don't understand how to avoid it happening again. To them it feels like a random scary experiment. \n\nShe is talking because she knows her brain doesn't work right, and she is using your perceptions like a guide dog for the blind.\n\nIt's hard to share close quarters. But you need to find a way to cope. Like wearing headphones, and giving clear direction about what you want her to do (versus not do).\n\n\"It's time for you to do XYZ. I am not listening to you, I want to do ABC by myself now. Goodbye\"\n\nIf you contact social services they may have classes or respite care services.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
