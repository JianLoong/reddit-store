I myself have a highly severe allergy to raw carrots, so bad that I cannot be in the kitchen when my boyfriend cuts them, or else I'll get trouble breathing immediately. My boyfriend understands this but I would never forbid him from cooking, as he loves it and he enjoys carrots. But he understands also he has to clean the kitchen from too to bottom afterwards and wash the dishes with hot water and clean surfaces and that's absolutely okay for me.

Why should my allergy make it impossible for him to eat carrots? \n\nIt really depends on my question and if you have already talked to her about separate floors in the fridge etc.", "NTA.

Think about it this way and her attitude towards it, say at some point in the near future you guys have a child and that child has a peanut allergy. Toddlers literally get into everything and I mean everything. Is she going to argue that she can just use a different bowl and spoon until she looks away and the toddler takes a bite. It\u2019s not a crazy request to have something that will literally kill you banned from the house and if she truly cared about you she would have stop eating peanut butter the moment she found out how deathly allergic you are. If my wife had a deathly allergy to something and I found out I would avoid it at all cost cause I do not want to be at fault for anything happening to her and I care enough to make a small lifestyle change.", "NTA. I am severely allergic to all nuts. Been living with my now husband for 12 years, and he'd never even think of bringing nuts in the house. I never had to ask him to give it up, it's just a basic safety precaution to prevent anaphylaxis. We both enjoy sunflower seed butter and tahini as nut butter substitutes.", "NTA.  She isn't taking your allergy seriously.  You may want to reconsider moving in with this person.   Your safety doesn't seem to be a concern.", "NTA. For context, my bf is allergic to coconut. He's not allergic enough to go into anaphylactic shock just from casual interaction, but ingesting any would certainly be deadly. When we moved in together, I didn't bring anything coconut with me. \n\n\n\nI love coconut ice cream, my adult sons love German chocolate cake, and we all love coconut cookies. So, I eat my coconut snacks at work and if I make coconut stuff for my sons, I send it home with them and they eat it there. If I'm cooking with it (for the boys), I do it while he's at work and clean everything up before he returns. \n\n\n\nIt's a matter of respect and care. No food is worth putting someone else in danger over. She can eat peanuts and peanut butter at work or away from home and do what she needs to do to keep you safe. If she can't do that, maybe she's not mature enough to be in a serious relationship. \n\n\n\nAs for the sugar thing, you could set up a system where you keep all your sweets in a certain place that she can avoid to keep from temptation. Purging the whole house of sugar would be kind of you, but it's not equivalent to your allergy and shouldn't be compared.", "NTA definitely reconsidered moving in together though I can\u2019t imagine wanting my bf to potentially have to go the hospital because of peanut butter. My BIL is allergic to shrimp my sister hasn\u2019t eaten shrimp in forever unless he is out of town definitely rethink this relationship", "NTA. You need to reconsider this relationship. This is literally a life or death situation for you and she doesn't give 2 shits. That should tell you all you need to know about her.......", "NTA. She is uncaring and selfish. Even the act of kissing you could majorly hurt you if she eats peanut butter, and oral sex could also kill you. You might want to reconsider this relationship.

His favorite kind of cigarettes was a mental which has mint in it.  Whenever I went over to his house I would always end up feeling kind of sick afterwards why would wake up in the middle of the night having trouble breathing and going to get something to drink. I didn't realize he was constantly having mint all over him until I saw him buy some cigarettes and freaked out... Not only did he switch cigarette types he also eventually stopped smoking. We've barely been dating for 6 months... Do you know how hard it is to quit smoking? And yet your girlfriend who you've been with long enough to start living together won't stop eating peanut butter?

I just really like peanut butter, it's a part of my breakfast every morning too.\n\nSoft YTA for not making this clearer early on.
