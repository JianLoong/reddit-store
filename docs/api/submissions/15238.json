She needs to decide what she values more: peanuts or your life. My mom stopped cooking fish when she married my dad, because he is severely allergic. She eats it out of the house, but not at home, because she cares about his health.", "NTA.  She doesn't seem to understand how serious your allergy is, or she doesn't care.  Honestly, I don't think you should be sharing a living space with someone who doesn't take this allergy seriously.  You could DIE because she wants to have peanut butter on her porridge.  If that is more important to her than your life, then you should not be living together.", "It doesn't sound like she's ready to share a life with someone else, which does at times involve sacrifice.\n\nAn ex housemate was allergic to nuts...I never bought any into the house from that day onwards.

For some reason, a lot of people struggle to grasp this concept and the level of risk. Considering she compared a life-threatening allergy to her diet she seems to fall into this camp.\n\nHowever, if you can't educate her, remove her from the equation. You deserve somebody who won't risk killing you because they like eating peanut butter and either can't understand the risk, or worse, doesn't care. \n\nAlso, an alternative without peanuts probably exists.", "NTA.

You are not imposing rules on her because you like it and this is not a tit-for-tat situation. \n\nPeanut butter can literally kill you and she refuse to remove it from your new home because she likes the taste of it. It's completely unreasonable.\n\nHer even comparing this to you eating sweets is an absolute joke. Is she 12 and fail to realise what death is? No, it is not comparable in any dimension. It's comparable to asking her to sit in the car without seatbelts while you drive drunk. It's comparable to having a cobra in your living room that's \"alright, he doesn't bite\". She is throwing dice with your life and it would literally be manslaughter if she recklessly cause your death. The seriousness of this cannot be understated and I think even you are too relaxed on this. Cross contamination is so easy if you use the same kitchen. It only takes one morning of not wiping off the cutting board or not washing the spoon properly. \n\nShe will have to come to terms with peanuts not being a part of your home, and there is no demanding favours in return. If not, you cannot be safe in that home.", "NTA\n\nWow. Your gf is unbelievably selfish. She would rather she you dead than give up her snack.\n\nDieting and life threatening allergies simply cannot be compared.\n\nI would NOT move in with her.

No, the two are not comparable. \n\nYou're NTA but you should be willing to accommodate her wishes (if she is serious and not just using her comparison to stamp her foot and refuse to stop eating peanut butter.) But the peanut butter needs to stop. This isn't about a preference, it's a life safety issue for you.", "NTA. I used to be severely allergic to peanuts as well\n\nWhat if she forgets to brush her teeth really well after eating them and kisses you? Sending you into anaphylactic shock? \n\nShe literally is saying she values your life less than her food toppings, y\u2019all are moving in together. It\u2019s reasonable to assume anyone at this stage who likes / loves their SO would give something up that poses the risk of killing them ESPECIALLY since you\u2019re moving in together\n\nI hate saying break up but\u2026. I\u2019d advise it\n\nEdit: wanted to add this. She\u2019s also being a bit gas lighty (I think I\u2019m using that right) by saying what she did about sweets.

I like peanut butter, but if someone close to me was deathly allergic to peanuts, peanuts would no longer be in my house. I don't want my friend to die because of me. I think you should, at the very least, rethink moving in with her. She may then promise not to have peanut butter in the house anymore, but I am not sure I would believe her.

I won\u2019t die, but if I were to have even a crumb of gluten, I start vomiting blood, get horrible joint pain, migraines, etc. I often end up being sick for months and sometimes need to be hospitalized. It\u2019s a rough time but not immediately life-threatening. Anyway, the first thing my SO said when we moved in together was that we were going to have a gluten-free kitchen, because my health was more important than him being able to eat gluten at home. Keep in mind that we live in North America, where gluten is found in basically everything like bread, candy and chocolate, soya sauce, even hash browns. So this meant that my SO had to change about 60% of his diet and he *gladly* did it, because my health and well-being is important to him. \n\nOn the other hand, the first thing my ex said when I was diagnosed with celiac was \u201cI\u2019m not eating any gluten free bullshit.\u201d He made it perfectly clear that his preferences were more important than my health. \n\nYour partner is acting a lot like my ex, and you need to decide if you want to build a life with someone who values oatmeal toppings more than your literal life.

The entire concept of moving in together comes down to compromise, which is actually to figure out stuffs while not sacrificing anyone's lifestyle. \n\nI mean how is there going to be accidents, if she has a seperate bowl and spoon and a clearly labelled container of peanut butter? Also, if she's health conscious, then yeah having sweets around will make her crave it more and she'll be unable to stay fit.\n\nSo yeah, neither of you are wrong since neither of you want to give up your lifestyle.
