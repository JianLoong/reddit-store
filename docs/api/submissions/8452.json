Or was there a breakup at some point before his passing?", "ESH.  Telling your partner who you live just to go stay elsewhere is a dick move.  You should have discussed it with him before allowing this person to crash for an indefinite period.  He lives there.  I assume he pays rent.  His opinion should be considered.  \n\nThat being said there is something about his reaction that doesn't sit right.  Like, you don't help out a friend in need so that they can repay you.  Why does he assume she's going to stick her nose in your business?", "YTA. Your decision is final is it? You live *together*. You don't get to make sole decisions on big things like moving people into your *shared home*. You go leave or stay with your mom if you don't like that.", "ESH. I understand you made a promise, and you care for this person so you want to offer a room.\n\nBut you offered her space in your mutual home without talking to your partner first? Super asshole territory - household decisions like that shouldn't be made unilaterally. \n\nThat being said, it does sound like his reasons aren't very good and like allowing someone to crash in a spare room shouldn't be a big issue.", "YTA\nI'm sorry but a decision like this needs to be discussed and agreed upon with your BF.

Or perhaps you can explore options that would allow her to stay for a while and make your partner more comfortable? Maybe put a time limit or certain rules in place? I can understand your bf's frustration.", "YTA You both pay to live there. You don't get to just unilaterally decide that someone gets to stay there indefinitely for free.", "YTA; my decision is final? No, no it is not. You live together. Did you also tell him before you started dating that you\u2019re going to kick him out of his living space at any time you wish?", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t unilaterally make a decision that impacts both of you when you share a living space. Also, this is a person he has no connection with, so it\u2019s basically his partner invited a stranger (to him) to move in for an indefinite period of time and he can\u2019t have an opinion on it or he can move out.

Also its frankly kind of bizarre that its on you to take care of your ex's sister who is older than you.", "NTA and only because, ONLY, because he said that about your dead partner. Fucked. Up. They're DEAD, they can't repay anyone for anything. She's not your ex's sister, she is someone who was going to be *your sister*, if your partner hadn't died.\n\nI completely understand how unfair it is for you to make a unilateral decision, and I completely understand that someone moving into your shared home should be a shared decision, and I don't think he's out of line for thinking that you should have asked him or for not being ok with it. But I stopped caring about all of those things when I read how he referred to your previous partner. Sorry, idk how to phrase it, but I wouldn't call him your ex, personally.", "NTA but your boyfriend is definitely a huge asshole. You made a promise that you intend to keep, not to mention that she\u2019s like family to you. Are you sure you want to stay with this guy?", "NTA this says a lot about who you are as a person. It also says a lot about your current boyfriend.", "This is probably an unpopular opinion but ESH. Frankly him way more than you. You live together so really any long term house guests should be a mutual agreement. \n\nThat being said, his reaction seems way over the top. Unless she has a history of being a bit of a mooch it's hard not to read this as jealousy over the ex.", "What a beautiful and shiny spine you have - you're awesome!\n \nYou are fulfilling a promise you made because *you* want to and because you *choose* to do so.\n \nIt sounds like he's putting it in terms that imply he's worried for both of your welfare - 'interjecting' and 'leeching', but to me it seems he's more concerned that it's\n- going to inconvenience him, and\n- he feels threatened by this reminder of your lost partner/relationship\n \nWho are you supposedly 'appeasing' in this situation? That is some subtle and negative language to imply you are weak and under someone else's influence.\n \nFrankly, this guy sounds quite insecure and selfish as heck - he's not showing himself in a good light as someone you'd want in your corner if you ran into difficulties in the future. After all, he's willing to dismiss your wishes on this, try to manipulate you out of doing something you want to do, and toss out a young woman in a vulnerable situation with little in the way of other supports!\n \nAt the very least he's not listening to you and/or thinks you're not capable of making your own decisions and dealing with the consequences.\n\nHave you considered waving goodbye to the guy and getting yourself a new housemate (the sister)?\n\nTotally NTA.\n\nEdit: I want to add - a large part of the reason for my judgement is that I would also want to help the woman who might have been my sister-in-law. I would ask my fella/discuss it, saying 'This is what I'd like to happen and this is why'. And if your current partner either can't wrap his head around why you'd feel that way, or is opposed without a *damn good* reason (e.g. anxiety re safe personal spaces) which hasn't been mentioned, I'd very much be considering how compatible we were.\n \n???What's the point of a spare room if people can't stay in it when it's needed???\n\nP.S. I saw that rent, etc is split %60/%40, with you paying the %60. Possibly he's worried about someone *else* mooching your resources + taking his place?", "NTA: Unless you spend time reminiscing with her over your lost lover, that would make any man uncomfortable, even if he tried to hide it. Otherwise, you made a promise. Keep it.", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend is showing red flags. The behaviour is controlling and insensitive. At minimum, it is a sign that you're not compatible as you have completely different outlooks when it comes to others.\n\nThe biggest red flag is that he has you questioning whether of not you're the ass hole because you decided to act like a decent human being with integrity.", "NTA. BF is entitled and refusing to see why this is important to you. The alternative you gave is perfectly reasonable and he cannot just expect you to go back on your word because it makes him uncomfortable.", "Trying too hard to appease someone who wouldn't repay me.  Wow that is a crappy attitude to have. So only do things for people you know will really you back I guess he will never volunteer with a charity. He is an AH.", "NTA Do what you want.  He has options the SIL doesn't.  I would only tell her that she has a time frame to get it together... like 3-6 months.  That's enough time to get a job and go.", "Nta.  Even if the ex was still alive, you're simply helping a friend.  As long as the roommate respects boundaries, I see no problem with the situation.\n\n\nAlso sorry for your loss.", "NTA \n\nI would have said NAH until the part when your boyfriend said your trying too hard to appease someone who won\u2019t repay you - yikes! I can understand your boyfriends feelings of being uncomfortable and coming second but he\u2019s an asshole for how he\u2019s taking it out on you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
