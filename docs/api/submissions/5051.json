The family has already agreed not to mess with strangers anymore & I know I\u2019m the asshole for violating his privacy. I appreciate the answers that I\u2019m wrong for entering his room, but they don\u2019t help answer my question. In the moment when I heard him cussing out Ally for my actions, my instinct was to confront him, and I\u2019m inquiring if THAT makes me the AH.\n\nEvery year my family takes a weekend trip in December to the same place, ~3-4 hours from where we all live. Any given year there\u2019s between 14-20+ of us. My mom foots the bill for the hotel for everyone. This year myself (25f) and my boyfriend (26m) split a connected room with my cousin Ally (21f) and her boyfriend Craig (21m). Most of us hadn\u2019t met Craig yet before this trip.\n\nWe\u2019re a generally loud, friendly bunch but we all have big personalities. All of our keys were programmed to open all of the rooms. This morning my mom made breakfast in the room we\u2019d all chosen to congregate in & it was ready around 9. It\u2019s normal for everyone to roll in as we wake up, but if you sleep late, you also may have someone pop in to mess with you. Around noon my brother (a child) went to the rooms where cousins were sleeping & poked at them saying \u201cwake up\u201d & left. Some did, some kept sleeping. We realized Ally was at breakfast but Craig wasn\u2019t. I jokingly said I\u2019d get him, went to their room, turned on the lights & said \u201cgood morning sunshine breakfast is ready when you are!\u201d Then I left.\n\nThe door connecting our two rooms was closed when I went back to my room. I heard Craig yelling at Ally so I started listening, and he was cussing at her about me turning on the lights, calling me every name under the sun, etc., so I knocked on the door & said \u201chey buddy these walls aren\u2019t as thick as you think they are.\u201d He yelled back \u201cgood I hope you can hear me bitch, who the fuck do you think you are?\u201d\n\nHonestly, I saw red. More words were exchanged. After, I went to the congregating room and told the family what happened. Next thing I knew, Ally\u2019s dad was driving Craig home & Ally, her mom & brother were also leaving because they rode together. They were barely here 12 hours. Ally is pissed at me. It seems like her parents have taken Craig\u2019s side. My mom & grandma are concerned that Craig has fooled them into thinking he\u2019s Mr Nice Guy & that behind closed doors he\u2019s mean to Ally (she has always been very shy and sweet and quiet). I don\u2019t know what I think about that in particular, I just know I hate him & I\u2019m too close to be objective. Especially because maybe our family games are normal & fun to me but totally absurd to an outsider. So please opine because if I\u2019m in the wrong here I\u2019ll own it and I could see it both ways.

If I were on this holiday with you, I'd be extremely weirded out if 20 people I don't know had the key of my room. And I'd be very pissed by a random stranger entering my room and demanding me to wake up. I may be resting (a vacation is for resting), I may be feeling unwell, I may be in the shower, I may be naked. Yours is extremely intrusive behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, Craig shouldn't have insulted Ally or you, so ESH.", "ESH, if Someone I don\u2019t know comes into my private room to wake me up I\u2019d be pissed.\n\nSure, he shouldn\u2019t have called you names but you need to understand that not everyone is going to be ok with your family lack of boundaries.", "Why are you all allowing a child to walk in to adults' room like that? Have you never considered people having a morning quickie?\n\nIt is so very off that you all can open each other's rooms like that, and that you will mess with each other. Sounds like this was going to happen one way or another. So the kid wakes him up first with an undignified poke, and then you barge in and yell at him? \n\nThis doesn't sound cute or fun loving, but just mean spirited, and a disaster waiting to happen for the kid allowed to barge into rooms without warning. \n\nAnd he wasn't being mean to Ally, but rather bad-mouthing you, to which you joined in. Sounds like you're both in the wrong here, but no judgement because the dude also over-reacted a bit.", "ESH\n\nCraig definitely overreacted but someone had already gone in to wake them up. Craig had remained sleeping, your cousin came down. You overstepped by going in there and attempting to wake him up a second time.", "ESH. \n\nYou crossed a boundary then he jumped on it and totally blew this out of proportion", "ESH: jeez, have some boundaries to barging into peoples rooms and turning on the lights. That just weird at your age to be doing that. For Craig, he is an asshole for snapping like that, and how he spoke to ally. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t confuse the fact. Craigs behavior is one thing. But the barging and not rooms is what created this issue.", "ESH\u2026 you have not met him before but it seems a little too close for comfort to barge in the room and turn on the lights. You never know if someone isn\u2019t feeling well and if I was woken up like that by pretty much a stranger still, I would be upset too. But his reaction was uncalled for and he seems like an asshole too.", "It's rude to just enter someone's room and demand they wake up for breakfast", "ESH. YOu didn't know him to wake him up like that. You violated his privacy, and that is just rude. However, yelling and being verbally abusive is no excuse. You started this and bear some responsibility for what happened. In the future,  everyone having keycards only for their respective rooms might work better as well. The setup could make for another family blow-up.", "ESH\n\nHe was wrong for escalating things as far as he did. You were wrong for bothering him while he was sleeping.", "\"We\u2019re a generally loud, friendly bunch but we all have big personalities.\" Let me translate: \"We're obnoxious assholes who refuse to accept that other people might like some peace and quiet.\" YTA", "What you did was rude, but his response was over the top, plus he vented his rage at Ally. NTA.", "I was about to judge E S H because startling people awake is really inconsiderate, but his reaction was completely out of line. I could understand him being annoyed, but cussing out your cousin and then calling you a b**** and yelling at both of you? That seems ridiculously hostile and violent. God, that's actually really worrisome, especially since he's only just met most of you. \n\nNTA and honestly, I would be concerned for your cousin's safety with him.", "YTA\n\nyou invaded his privacy, for all you knew he could have been undressed/undressing.\n\nyou woke him up.\n\nyou eavesdropped on his conversation with Ally, and even had the nerve to interrupt, as though you were in the right! \n\nCraig had every right to be mad.", "NTA, holy hell Craig is really a sensitive little snowflake. I mean you turned the freaking light on, you didn\\`t drop a bomb in his room. I get that some people don\\`t like being woken up but still nothing can justify that much unnecessary cursing and insulting.", "NTA.\n\nI get him not being fond of getting to being woken up that way, but you don't get to yell because of it. Also it was after 9AM. I myself like sleeping in late, but 9AM is *not* early in the slightest. You were all having breakfast and it would be rude to not want to include him. He could still have said \"I'm not hungry and still really tired, so I'm gonna skip it this time, but thanks anyway.\"\n\nJust a few things that stand out though:\n\n1. him yelling and cussing at your cousin, callling you all sorts of names\n2. him yelling and cussing at you\n3. her parenst actually taking *his* side over their own daughter's side\n4. considering most people haven't met him get me thinking they aren't together for *that long*. Not only that, but also he's younger than you, and yet he confidently acts like that??\n5. \"My mom & grandma are concerned that Craig has fooled them into thinking he\u2019s Mr Nice Guy & that behind closed doors he\u2019s mean to Ally\" I'm afraid they are spot on.\n\nCraig is a major AH, and Ally's parents are major AH's for allowing their daughter to be treated that way. Ally is NTA in my opinion because while she is angry at you for a wrong reason, she is basically in an abusive relationship with no one close helping her and probably being gaslit that Craig is an amazing guy who can do no wrong and that everyone who is against him is the bad guy, in this case you.\n\nI hope she gets out of that relationship, because it will only get worse...\n\nEdit: spelling", "He had already ignored other attempts to wake him up + his girlfriend waking up and getting ready next to him, and he was asleep past noon? And he lost his mind when someone came in and turned on the lights? NTA.", "YTA - you effed around and found out why not to poke a sleeping bear.  He was a rude as a subsidized guest perhaps but I'll forgive that because of your over-the-top behavior.  You'd have gotten worse from me.", "nta\n\nCraig sounds like he has serious anger issues.", "If I was in his position I\u2019d feel utterly disrespected and would feel pissed too. What exactly gives you the right to dictate when he gets up? \n\nYTA", "Absolutely NTA. Craig sounds like a future wife beater.", "Nta he was a guest meeting his girlfriend's relatives and is not up and downstairs by noon? How rude. He was holding up plans that were made for the day. It should've been Ally getting him up. He sounds a nasty piece of work. Hopefully you won't have to deal with him again.", "YTA", "I think people are missing that if the family wanted privacy they wouldn\u2019t have all the keys programmed to unlock all of the rooms. I think main reason is you heard how Craig verbally abuses your family member and now that his nice guy persona is exposed he got angry. NTA", "Based on you clarifying what you\u2019re actually asking, NTA. The way you\u2019ve described the way Craig was talking to you cousin was uncalled for, his reaction to you was even more out of line. Yes you were out of line for going into basically a strangers room and turning on all the lights but there were appropriate ways to talk to you about this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The way he felt so comfortable screaming at his girlfriend while in a house full of people he had only just met, and being so very hostile to OP, makes me think that this kind of violent behavior comes naturally to him and I would guess that acting like this is probably not out of character for him.

Also, people in the comments say he might be an introvert, but newsflash, an introvert wouldn't have the confidence to yell like that to someone they barely know. *I'm* an introvert, it takes a lot of energy to *talk* to people who are basically strangers, let alone *yell.*", "He has rage issues and totally understandable to think that can be dangerous.

How long have they been together, I wonder.", "Certainly it would be much worse if he were actually cursing at the sister.  But Craig is still in the wrong for yelling at his girlfriend, regardless.

If this is his best behavior, then I think it\u2019s a bad situation for the girlfriend.", "To clarify: he was cussing about me to Ally, calling me names, but directing his anger towards me at her. As in, he was angry with her for what I did & blaming her for it. She knew I was going to do it and didn\u2019t stop me, but blaming her for something I did is still unacceptable because she has no control over my actions. I did not see red until he called me a bitch and asked who I thought I was. If he wanted to vent about me that\u2019s all good, I would\u2019ve been MORE than happy to speak civilly about it. What I was not okay with was Ally getting cussed at for it, so I knocked on the door to tell him to knock it off, and he started cussing at me. That\u2019s when I saw red.", "The fact that he is yelling at his gf, alone makes him an AH. If he\u2019s going to yell at anyone, he should\u2019ve yelled at the OP. \n\nNumber two, he \u201ccalled OP everything under the sun.\u201d That\u2019s still her brother. Craig should not be talking about OP\u2019s brother in those terms.", "Berating her or venting?  OP says the curses were directed at OP.", "The hell it doesn't.  Someone doing that to me will get worse and deservedly so.", "I have a family similar to yours. My partner\u2019s family is the exact opposite. I spent the first year of our relationship wondering if their parents hated me because they never initiated a hug. My partner spent the first year feeling the teasing by my cousins was personal and meant they didn\u2019t want them around. It was complicated.\n\nHowever, the main point is that we were responsible for our own families. If my partner was upset that my parents were being too informal or intrusive they talked to me. If I wasn\u2019t able to see what the problem was - because we only know the family dynamic we know - that sometimes turned into an argument. The same went for any issues I had with their family.\n\nIt would have been horrible if my parents barged in and said my partner\u2019s issues were with them. It\u2019s my job to prep my partner and advocate for them, just like my partner does for me. \n\nThe argument between your cousin and her bf may not have been completely about you. It could have been more about why she wasn\u2019t supporting him and siding with the family instead. It could have also been about why she didn\u2019t warn him that your family barges into stranger\u2019s rooms.\n\nHowever, even if it was solely about your choice to walk in and why that bothered him, that\u2019s still a communication issue between the two of them. If they are a couple then they need to decide together how to handle it, and she likely needs to be the one to tell the family what their boundaries are as a couple.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cpunishment\u201d to have an argument with a partner. Ally also needs to be able to navigate arguments herself. It would have been fine to stop the argument because you believed the behavior was unacceptable, but an argument about one partner\u2019s family absolutely should be between partners.", "I was under the impression that he was berating \"U\" to his girlfriend, as is his right as she should have at least warned him that your family has poor boundaries with strangers... And then you burst in once again... once again the blatant disregard of their rooms boundaries, and while you did the right thing trying to redirect his righteous anger to the right target, he does not know U at all.  YTA in this situation.", "From your description, it sounds like was venting about *you*, not attacking her per se.  \n\nIf he was, then he's a total AH.", "And you shouldn't have. If Ally didn't try to wake him up, it was for a reason.\n\nDid you even ask Ally about him still being asleep or did you just go upstairs without her knowing?", "The only 'plan' was shared breakfast at that point. Didn't even bother checking with his gf why he wasn't there.", "Upset and made them extremely uncomfortable. Not everyone is extrovert like your family.And I'm quite afraid to ask you what kind of pranks your family play.\n\nFor introvert/shy/reserved people, your holiday sounds like a journey to hell.", "Lesson here is to stop doing this.", "A happy thought, but you've discovered your manners a bit too late.", "Did you ever apologize for barging into his room and try to de-escalate the situation at all?", ">the appropriate response would have been civilly requesting privacy in the future.\n\nIn normal circumstances, yes.  When someone's been startled from sleep, possibly sleep-deprived, possibly triggering fight-or-flight reactions and the internal emotional regulators aren't online yet?  That's what you can get.", "Why do you expect civility from someone when they are rightfully angry with you? I never understand this. \"Ah yes you have a complete right to be angry with me but if you show that you are angry in any way you are behaving inappropriately!\" Like?? Honestly, it sounds to me what you're really looking for is a way to deflect from your poor behavior by saying that he has also behaved badly in reaction to your poor behavior.", "Nope. Just usually a good idea to start from a place of being a decent human being. Maybe he'd still be an asshole, who knows. You're the one who posted, this is your feedback.", "No, I didn't miss that part, but I think he is so much more in the wrong that it actually created an entirely different situation that has nothing to do with some silly prank. We can have different judgements, that is okay. We just see things differently. \n\nMaybe it's for the best that this whole situation occurred because it allowed Craig to show his true colors. Hopefully, the family will keep a close eye on him and keep Ally safe.", "Introverts don't cuss you to high heaven for being woken up at noun (get it, the lights aren't everyone's favourite though). That being said, EXTROverts don't cuss you to high heaven for being woken up at noun either. *Douchebags* cuss at you for that reason. My responce about the introvert thing was because people were apperently using it as an excuse for his behaviour.\n\nETA; I know that introverts can explode though, look at Tom Hanks (no idea wether or not ontrovert, but just an example). While he is the coolest guy in existence as in , wouldn't hurt a fly, never gets angry etc., a few months ago he exploded towards fans for pushing away his wife to get his authograph. In Craig's case that doesn't seem the right move to me.", "Yelling at her?  I agree.", "ESH in that case.", "But he was nonetheless cussing at *Ally* and taking his anger out on her.", "Ew.", "The sticky widget is he didn't take it on the jackass cousin of his partner who invaded his privacy, he took it out on his partner. Not cool.", "Ally knew I was going, yes. We were all sitting at the table when my aunt told me to go turn on his lights.", ">For introvert/shy/reserved people, your holiday sounds like a journey to hell.\n\nYup.  And this time they didn't get the passive, conflict-avoidant type of introvert who would grin and bear it, to her considerable surprise.  I have no sympathy for OP.", "That\u2019s the general consensus among the family now.", "My knocking on the door & saying \u201chey buddy these walls aren\u2019t as thick as you think they are\u201d was my attempt at de-escalating. I thought he\u2019d calm down if he knew others could hear him yelling.", "If he was startled awake wouldn\u2019t I have gotten that reaction instantly, and not her getting it 20 minutes later? If it was instinctive it would have been right when I walked in. And although I don\u2019t know his life story, he\u2019s a college frat boy & I think if he had any sleep issues Ally would\u2019ve given us a heads up when we were waking everyone. Also, perhaps just don\u2019t join us on family vacation if you have a sleep disorder that\u2019s going to require you to sleep past noon and disturb everyone\u2019s plans.", "It\u2019s still doesn\u2019t preclude the OP from being an AH for going in and waking up someone whom he barely knew.", "Oh I agree with you I just made a poorly worded joke", "Also for calling the OP a bunch of names. He could\u2019ve easily expressed that he was annoyed that the OP barged into the room. And again, shouldn\u2019t there be an element of politeness when you\u2019re first getting to know someone?  Like giving them the benefit of the doubt?\n\nYou can still tell your friends later how it was nuts.  But in the moment, I would just say \u201cwow that was kind of crazy\u201d or something. I wouldn\u2019t go into a full-blown tirade.", "Yup, ESH in that case.", "Startling someone awake, especially when you're a stranger, can trigger fight-or-flight responses, especially in those with PTSD.  People have gotten unintentionally hurt for such things.  It's never a good idea.", "Yeah, sounds like he went beyond just venting.  ESH.", "Her sitting at the table doesn't necessarily mean she heard you. Did you directly talk to her about this or did she respond to you saying you were going up?", "Probably a good idea.\n\nYou need to remember these are new people that you do not know.\n\nAs far as you know, he could have some form of PTSD where being woken by lights getting turned on suddenly and you loudly announcing it was time to wake up could be triggering for him (or even the act of a stranger entering his bedroom when he was sleeping).\n\nNot saying it's the case here but it's a solid reason not to in the future.", "You mean deliberately further escalating, right? Because that's what you did.", "That does not sound like an apology. I think saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d would have been more effective and welcome. ESH.", "Oops, sorry, non-English speaker here, didn't get the joke because of it :-)", "Sometimes reddit is just plain delusional.", "She was sitting next to me and laughed when my aunt told me to go turn on the lights. We were talking about her boyfriend at that moment. To be honest, I think your whole point here is that we shouldn\u2019t turn on the lights/wake people up anymore, and I\u2019ve already agreed with you on that. My question is whether I\u2019m the asshole for redirecting his cussing towards me when he was punishing Ally for my actions. To the effect that you disagree with us waking him up, I hear you, I agree, and it wont happen anymore.", "That\u2019s a really great point actually! Until it bit us in the ass we just never even thought of that possibility.", "OK ESH, including Ally for letting you guys go mess with her boyfriend.", "Why didn't Ally go wake him up instead?"]}
