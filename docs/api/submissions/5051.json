{"id": 5051, "submission_id": "zp6hnk", "title": "AITA for confronting my cousin\u2019s boyfriend & causing them to leave the family vacation?", "selftext": "Edit: I need to clarify that my question is whether I\u2019m the asshole for confronting him when he yelled at Ally. The family has already agreed not to mess with strangers anymore & I know I\u2019m the asshole for violating his privacy. I appreciate the answers that I\u2019m wrong for entering his room, but they don\u2019t help answer my question. In the moment when I heard him cussing out Ally for my actions, my instinct was to confront him, and I\u2019m inquiring if THAT makes me the AH.\n\nEvery year my family takes a weekend trip in December to the same place, ~3-4 hours from where we all live. Any given year there\u2019s between 14-20+ of us. My mom foots the bill for the hotel for everyone. This year myself (25f) and my boyfriend (26m) split a connected room with my cousin Ally (21f) and her boyfriend Craig (21m). Most of us hadn\u2019t met Craig yet before this trip.\n\nWe\u2019re a generally loud, friendly bunch but we all have big personalities. All of our keys were programmed to open all of the rooms. This morning my mom made breakfast in the room we\u2019d all chosen to congregate in & it was ready around 9. It\u2019s normal for everyone to roll in as we wake up, but if you sleep late, you also may have someone pop in to mess with you. Around noon my brother (a child) went to the rooms where cousins were sleeping & poked at them saying \u201cwake up\u201d & left. Some did, some kept sleeping. We realized Ally was at breakfast but Craig wasn\u2019t. I jokingly said I\u2019d get him, went to their room, turned on the lights & said \u201cgood morning sunshine breakfast is ready when you are!\u201d Then I left.\n\nThe door connecting our two rooms was closed when I went back to my room. I heard Craig yelling at Ally so I started listening, and he was cussing at her about me turning on the lights, calling me every name under the sun, etc., so I knocked on the door & said \u201chey buddy these walls aren\u2019t as thick as you think they are.\u201d He yelled back \u201cgood I hope you can hear me bitch, who the fuck do you think you are?\u201d\n\nHonestly, I saw red. More words were exchanged. After, I went to the congregating room and told the family what happened. Next thing I knew, Ally\u2019s dad was driving Craig home & Ally, her mom & brother were also leaving because they rode together. They were barely here 12 hours. Ally is pissed at me. It seems like her parents have taken Craig\u2019s side. My mom & grandma are concerned that Craig has fooled them into thinking he\u2019s Mr Nice Guy & that behind closed doors he\u2019s mean to Ally (she has always been very shy and sweet and quiet). I don\u2019t know what I think about that in particular, I just know I hate him & I\u2019m too close to be objective. Especially because maybe our family games are normal & fun to me but totally absurd to an outsider. So please opine because if I\u2019m in the wrong here I\u2019ll own it and I could see it both ways. AITA?\n\nEdit 2: I was asked to add my following reply to one of the comments: \nWe didn\u2019t wake him until noon, breakfast had been ready for 3 hours. We also had plans he was holding up. \n\nI also just found out that Ally\u2019s parents actually took him home out of respect because they were displeased with his behavior as well. Apparently Ally\u2019s dad wanted us to sit down and speak civilly (which I would have been so happy to do) about what happened, but Craig refused because he said he was too upset. I also learned Craig lied about when I came in the room and said I slammed all their doors/drawers and that I said other things I hadn\u2019t.\nMy mother also learned he had broken a wine glass in the room the night prior, before any of this happened. No explanation given. Could\u2019ve been an accident. We didn\u2019t hear anything in our room.

Craig had remained sleeping, your cousin came down. You overstepped by going in there and attempting to wake him up a second time.", "ESH. \n\nYou crossed a boundary then he jumped on it and totally blew this out of proportion", "ESH: jeez, have some boundaries to barging into peoples rooms and turning on the lights. That just weird at your age to be doing that. For Craig, he is an asshole for snapping like that, and how he spoke to ally. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t confuse the fact. Craigs behavior is one thing.

YOu didn't know him to wake him up like that. You violated his privacy, and that is just rude. However, yelling and being verbally abusive is no excuse.

Ally is NTA in my opinion because while she is angry at you for a wrong reason, she is basically in an abusive relationship with no one close helping her and probably being gaslit that Craig is an amazing guy who can do no wrong and that everyone who is against him is the bad guy, in this case you.\n\nI hope she gets out of that relationship, because it will only get worse...\n\nEdit: spelling", "He had already ignored other attempts to wake him up + his girlfriend waking up and getting ready next to him, and he was asleep past noon?

Hopefully you won't have to deal with him again.", "YTA", "I think people are missing that if the family wanted privacy they wouldn\u2019t have all the keys programmed to unlock all of the rooms. I think main reason is you heard how Craig verbally abuses your family member and now that his nice guy persona is exposed he got angry. NTA", "Based on you clarifying what you\u2019re actually asking, NTA. The way you\u2019ve described the way Craig was talking to you cousin was uncalled for, his reaction to you was even more out of line.

She knew I was going to do it and didn\u2019t stop me, but blaming her for something I did is still unacceptable because she has no control over my actions. I did not see red until he called me a bitch and asked who I thought I was. If he wanted to vent about me that\u2019s all good, I would\u2019ve been MORE than happy to speak civilly about it.

Someone doing that to me will get worse and deservedly so.", "I have a family similar to yours. My partner\u2019s family is the exact opposite. I spent the first year of our relationship wondering if their parents hated me because they never initiated a hug. My partner spent the first year feeling the teasing by my cousins was personal and meant they didn\u2019t want them around. It was complicated.\n\nHowever, the main point is that we were responsible for our own families. If my partner was upset that my parents were being too informal or intrusive they talked to me. If I wasn\u2019t able to see what the problem was - because we only know the family dynamic we know - that sometimes turned into an argument. The same went for any issues I had with their family.\n\nIt would have been horrible if my parents barged in and said my partner\u2019s issues were with them. It\u2019s my job to prep my partner and advocate for them, just like my partner does for me. \n\nThe argument between your cousin and her bf may not have been completely about you. It could have been more about why she wasn\u2019t supporting him and siding with the family instead. It could have also been about why she didn\u2019t warn him that your family barges into stranger\u2019s rooms.\n\nHowever, even if it was solely about your choice to walk in and why that bothered him, that\u2019s still a communication issue between the two of them.

Those reactions can last for hours afterwards.\n\nAlso just because he's in a frat doesn't mean he couldn't have PTSD or something similar. You keep making excuses for your family's behavior that most people here have explained to you isn't okay.", "You hear an argument that\u2019s centered around your actions and you thought inserting yourself would de-escalate it?", "That's an escalation, not de-escalating.", "...that is absolutely the worst desclation I've ever seen. Are you a cop?", "An apology would have been deescalating. What you did is not that.", "Yeah that was a great way to remind him that you dont Care about His privicy.", "He had every right to be angry with your cousin. Your cousin approved of your actions. Your cousin invited him in the first place. If your cousin can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t want to be an advocate for him when it comes to your family then their relationship isn\u2019t going to work.\n\nThat\u2019s a conversation that should happen without berating each other but it\u2019s a valid conversation and concern.", "Idk about you but I would never think it\u2019s okay to go in vacation with my partners family and sleep through half the day and make them wait and mess up their plans because I am a grown man who doesn\u2019t wake up until after noon.", "She also clarified that Craig had slept until *noon* and he was holding up their plans for the day. So, Ally was probably wanting him to get up so they could spend their vacation doing something other than sitting around waiting for him to roll out of bed.\n\nEveryone agrees (including OP herself) that OP shouldn't have let herself into his room and turned on his lights, but Craig seems to be pretty inconsiderate himself, making everyone waste their entire morning waiting for him to get up and get going. The better solution would have been to just leave him sleeping at the house while they all went out to do their plans for the day without him.", "Agreeing like you weren\u2019t just blaming it all on OP two seconds ago. Stfu", "Please stop mischaracterizing my replies in your comments. Not ONCE have I said Ally had anything to do with me waking him; only that she didn\u2019t object nor did she actually have an opportunity to. You\u2019re weaponizing my replies and twisting my words to draw your own conclusions & inadvertently victim blaming Ally for being in what may be a verbally abusive relationship. If your issue is with me for being an asshole, great. I was a dick and I reached Ally separately to apologize for any way my behavior negatively affected her. As the family has talked about the situation more details have come out & I\u2019ve shared them here. But not a single one has incriminated Ally & im super over seeing her villainized in a situation she was an observer to.", "Hahahahahah oh my god I hate how funny this is because I know you\u2019re insulting me but I laughed out loud. No, not a cop, hate cops. Wasn\u2019t a solid thought process in the first place.", "Hearing him berate my cousin for my actions, I didn\u2019t feel sorry for anyone but her.", "I\u2019m not sure how fair it is to say my cousin agreed with my actions. She\u2019s not confrontational so I think it\u2019s more likely that she wasn\u2019t comfortable asking me not to go do it and I should have expressly asked if Craig would be comfortable with our family antics", "You didn't redirect the cussing to him. You went in to pick a fight, and only made him angrier, resulting in the cousin going home, likely to a bigger tirade", "IDK about you but I would never imagine pranking and harassing new people as part of a weird family tradition where I admit that alot were probably uncomfortable and had to grit their teeth and just deal with it.\n\nThey're all assholes.", "Depends on jetlag/how long you were driving/how late you arrived.", ">So, Ally was probably wanting him to get up so they could spend their vacation doing something other than sitting around waiting for him to roll out of bed.\n\nThen Ally could have gone up and nicely woken him up.\n\nNo one is saying it would be wrong to wake him up, how they woke him up is the issue.\n\nOP has also stated that her cousin likely didn't want her to do this but was afraid to tell her no which is pretty telling of what OP and the rest of the family is like.\n\nSo either Ally is an asshole for going along with the joke or she wasn't able to stand up to her family when they told her they were going to go mess with her boyfriend.", "OP elaborated in a comment to me; ergo the change in opinion.", ">Not ONCE have I said Ally had anything to do with me waking him; only that she didn\u2019t object nor did she actually have an opportunity to.\n\nReally? Because I asked you: \"[Did you directly talk to her about this or did she respond to you saying you were going up?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp6hnk/comment/j0r5kl2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\"\n\nAnd you replied:\n\n>[She was sitting next to me and laughed when my aunt told me to go turn on the lights. We were talking about her boyfriend at that moment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp6hnk/comment/j0r6swg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nYou then tried to backtrack about Ally laughing when this was being planned and attempted to say she was to shy to tell you not to. It's part of your changing story.", "No experience with PTSD, I see.", "Another issue is you being an asshole has made it more difficult to clarify if the cousins bf is an asshole, and gave him something to hide behind.\n\nYou may have thought stomping in and restarting an argument was 'protecting' your cousin, but you've either caused her more grief, or annoyed a man who didn't deserve it\n\nIf you had concerns the better plot was to knock, them apologise when the door was answered, or speak to you cousin in a private moment. You just acted on impulse and could be making things worse\n\nYTA", "Except your cousin instigated your actions?", ">She\u2019s not confrontational so I think it\u2019s more likely that she wasn\u2019t comfortable asking me not to go do it\n\nThis says a lot about you and your family.\n\nLike you claim you were defending your cousin but you admit here she's basically afraid of asking a very simple, normal requests from you because it'll turn into a confrontation.\n\nI don't care how shy and introverted your cousin is, it's not normal for her to uncomfortable saying she'll go wake him up instead. That's a reaction to how you have all likely treated her in the past.", "Yes I agree with this. If he works Night Shift usually or was jet lagged then I would understand sleep schedule not lining up the first few days. OP didn\u2019t say that though", "Again, everyone agrees that OP shouldn't have woken him up the way she did. Nobody is disputing that and that's not the actual issue. \n\nCraig's reaction is the issue. He was so out of line that the situation actually became something else entirely. Does that make sense? It's no longer about some dumb prank anymore, but rather it's about how comfortable he was screaming and cussing at his girlfriend and his girlfriend's cousin in a house full of people he had just met. That's very concerning, and my guess is this kind of behavior is not out of character for him. That's not something most people would so casually do (even if they were extremely annoyed), unless it's something they're *used* to doing. That's just my guess.", "I didn\u2019t backtrack about her laughing. That still isn\u2019t a reply from her. & I stand by my assumption that she would have avoided confrontation by telling me not to go wake him. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to think that a shy person might laugh along with something they don\u2019t agree with. Especially if they\u2019re nervous. There\u2019ve been plenty of times I\u2019m in a group & don\u2019t necessarily agree with what\u2019s being said but I just laugh along rather than challenging them. Perhaps she didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get up and do it. Perhaps she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d react negatively or didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. Perhaps she didn\u2019t find the nerve to speak up. I don\u2019t know, and all of those things will be considerations for the future, but you\u2019re not going to condemn her for failing to speak up and laughing along to a situation I created.", "Not everybody can be a Reddit armchair specialist in everything.", "Fair", "She didn\u2019t instigate anything", "I\u2019m not sure I agree. She\u2019s been extremely shy and passive since literal birth. It was a fluid situation and I think it was on me to stop & ask her if it was okay, not on her, who I know is not confrontational, to stop me. If I\u2019d taken a moment to consider I would have asked if it was okay. Again, that\u2019s on me. I think the people blaming her are really unfair."]}
