{"id": 13867, "submission_id": "12a1713", "title": "AITA for threatening to ground my step daughter for purposely annoying my son's?", "selftext": "For a bit of context here: my husband is on my side. It's my step daughters grandmother that is having an absolute conniption and claiming I'm \"making my favoritism noticeable\". \n\nI have been with my husband for 8 years. He has a 10yo daughter, \"Mya\". I have two sons, 13yo \"Chris\" and 10yo \"Charlie\". Charlie has Autism and loud noises bother him a great deal. Chris just kind of does his own thing because he's at an age where he's too cool for his family, obviously. \ud83d\ude44\n\nMya is very big on singing and says she's going to be a singer when she grows up. I have no problem with this. I've encouraged her to pursue her dreams and I've even gotten her vocal lessons on my dollar because I believe she is fully capable (she has a great voice, just like her dad). But lately she has been completely changing up her singing style and going against all her vocal coaches teachings and doing that super annoying \"let's not pronounce any of the words fully so it sounds like we are moaning words the whole time\" type of style, like a lot of your new age artists. It has become unbearable even to me BUT I don't say anything. My son's on the other hand haven't been as laid back about it and I don't blame them at all but only because of one detail.. she insists on going in to ANY room they are in (even their bedrooms), bringing her tablet and singing as loudly as she possibly can in their space. Doesn't matter where they are. They've asked her to stop multiple times and she simply won't. It's completely setting off Charlie because again, loud noises trigger him anyway. He ends up going in to rages whenever she doesn't listen to him the first time he asks her to leave him alone and ends up throwing things. I've spoken to her several times and she truly acts like she does not give a damn what I say. Her eyes completely gloss over and she spaces out whenever I speak to her and all she says is \"mhm hmm\" while staring right through me and then stomps off to her room. I've asked why she does this and again, no answer. Just stares right through me. \n\nSo today she did it again and it was so loud that I could hear her on the other end of the house. I then here Charlie start screaming. Like raging out. I rush in and find her sitting on his bed, eyes closed just doing that really loud annoying moaning vocal thing she's been doing while Charlies face is beat red and fists clenched. I immediately told her she's going to be grounded. No more vocal lessons. No more tablet. Nothing. She immediately starts crying and screams at me that she isn't doing anything wrong. Again, her grandmother says I'm showing favoritism and dulling her granddaughters shine and that she \"just wants an audience\". AITA?\n\nETA: just a quick add here for a bit of context: my husband is currently not home. He is overseas and will be for the next two months or so working on a project (archeologist). He can't speak to her really unless it's on the phone and she simply doesn't listen to him that way. When he is home however she listens just fine.", "created_utc": 1680476004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12a1713/aita_for_threatening_to_ground_my_step_daughter/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is deliberately antagonizing and upsetting your sons. She barges into their bedrooms, uninvited, specifically to annoy them. Why she's doing this is anyone's guess, but hopefully grounding her will make her more forthcoming and will also teach her about boundaries and consideration. Until then, keep up the punishment.\n\nAlso, do your sons not have locks on their doors? It would keep step-sister from barging in uninvited to bother them.", "Let her go and sing badly and loudly at granny's house then. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nBut let me ask you, OP, what does it matter the kind of stuff she's singing or the kind of vocalization she does? If she wasn't singing but instead reciting full monologues from Shakespeare, it wouldn't matter. If she was just walking into room and screaming loudly (or howling like a wolf or something), it wouldn't matter. The issue is that she's wandering around and vocally taking over entire rooms to essentially give herself a captive audience. She could be singing angelically and that still wouldn't be okay.\n\nWhat she's doing is harassment--the fact that she's doing it by singing or whatever is irrelevant.\n\nYou may want to keep the issue honed to the actual problem: she's not \"performing\" for her siblings; she's harassing them. She almost certainly knows the difference by age ten, and if she doesn't know yet, she's gonna learn now.", "NTA. Of course she's doing something wrong. She's following people into their own space in order to do something they've asked her not to do, for crying out loud. She needs to stop that right away, and if she won't stop it without being punished, then she needs punishment to give her reason to stop it. Otherwise, she's never going to. \n\nIt's all much simpler than her grandmother is making it: she has no right to an audience. If someone wants to be her audience, great! If they don't, they have the right to make that choice and she has absolutely NO right to force them.", "NTA She is purposely annoying others by going into their bedrooms. It couldn't be more obvious that she is boundary stomping on purpose. She is denying others the peaceful enjoyment of their own space.\n\nI would suggest that you do your best to soundproof one room, preferably in a part of the house that is less likely to cause distress to others and make that the only spot for her to perfect her art without prior agreement with others in the house.\n\nEven without having sensory issues this would be offensive and unfair to others. You aren't playing favorites. It is your job to protect your kids. This is worth fighting over. Your kids deserve consideration, and Mya has no right to make everyone miserable to make herself happy. Stay strong.", "NTA she can sing in her own room. Tell the grandmother to stay out of it. Why does grandmother have a say in this and why hasn\u2019t your husband told his mom to stop giving parenting advice? And why hasn\u2019t your husband dealt with his child? All of this should be handled by him!", "NTA. Your stepdaughter needs to see consequences for her actions. You should have grounded her already, it\u2019s clear that she intentionally antagonising her siblings, there\u2019s no other reason to constantly be on close proximity to them and continue when they ask or demand her to stop. She lacks discipline and doesn\u2019t respect you as a parental figure (quite common for stepchildren). Get her father to lay down the law. Best of luck mate.", "NTA - You should ground her. Even if she was singing in a way that you liked she is being disruptive. Purposefully, going into rooms where people are to get a rise out of them. When it comes to her brother that is just straight cruel and unacceptable behavior. If she was in her own room or a designated area of the house for her music Or if she had a certain time that she was allowed to practice like 5-7, I\u2019d say that was okay but it sounds like she is just trying to push her boundaries. Grandma can sit down. If your daughter wants an audience to practice on then fine but she can\u2019t force audience members like her brother. Now if she wanted to set up a time where she could perform for you or her grandmother that\u2019s fine. But she can\u2019t just loudly sing throughout the house constantly with no structure at all. I think you made the right call and once she can respect others she can have her privileges back.", "INFO - OP, you've been with Mya for 8 years.  Is her bio-mother in her life?  Is there anything that might have triggered this selfish behaviour which apparently just started recently?  e.g. Does her father go away often?  If so, how does she normally react?", "NTA. Your step daughter is being manipulative and purposeful. You are the sole parent in charge at the moment. Act like it and protect your own child\u2019s needs.", "NTA, she needs to learn to respect boundaries", "This is an easy one. NTA. Shes going into their space to purposely annoy them. You're 100% right. Don't back down because of grandma. Time for some hard consequences. Frankly way past time. The only thing you've done wrong is let this continue for so damn long.", "NTA, yea she\u2019s being absolutely ridiculous. If this is something new and she\u2019s not usually an instigator I\u2019d maybe look into therapy while the dad\u2019s away. Seems like she just needs attention since she\u2019s missing her dad so much. I would also let her go back to vocal lessons if she stops, isolating her further from her interests may make issues worse.", "NTA.  I\u2019d send her to her grandmother\u2019s for a week or two and hear what she has to say about SD\u2019s behavior but chances are she would be the perfect angel, or at least granny would say.  Can you put a lock on your son\u2019s door so at least she cannot enter his room?   As to eliminating her vocal lessons stick to your word.  She is old enough to learn that her actions have consequences.", "She is bullying. I would tell her if she goes into your sons\u2019 rooms and bothers them  again like that there will be no voice lessons and take her electronics now. She needs to have severe consequences.", "NTA. She\u2019s purposely abusing your son. It\u2019s disgusting. This is unconscionable and frankly, that you\u2019ve let it get this far should be causing you some guilt. Step on this, HARD, and who tf cares what an ignorant old woman says.\n\nSo angry I\u2019m eta this little horror should lose every damn privilege she has right this second. Therapy, and if she doesn\u2019t stop, get her out of the house and away from that child.", "NTA, an audience is someone that is willingly listening.", "Nta. You gave her warnings, you asked her to stop. Grandma is wrong.", "NTA! She is being a rotten brat! She know damn well what she is doing is disrupting the house and especially setting off Charlie. Perfect punishment taking away what is causing the problem. As far as grandmother thinking you\u2019re picking on poor little Mya, ask her what weekends does she want to take her. Let HER spend some time with Mya and deal with the singing. Summer breaks coming. How many weeks does granny want her to come visit?! After all you\u2019re being such a meanie to Mya! So it would be a win win if she visits with the grandmother! She can spoil the precious brat and Charlie and everyone else gets some peace and quiet.", "NTA, but scale back on the punishment.  Permanently taking away items isn't going to end well and your first punishment for any offense shouldn't be excessive.  Let her keep the vocal lessons and take away tv and non-school use of electronics for a week.  \n\nIf she wants an audience tell her she can have you and your husband as her audience but your son's are no longer going to be her audience.  Then get locks for your kid's bedrooms and buy them white noise generators (this will block most noise from outside of the room). This gives your sons safe places from her in case she decides to antagonize them in other ways.", "I would take away her electronics as a punishment for invading others space.", "Ffs ground your daughter for a week and make it clear it's because she's deliberately annoying, harassing and mistreating her brothers. 10 is old enough to be cognizant of the fact she's deliberately bullying them\u2014 especially Charlie by triggering his episodes. Who cares about the grandmother.", "Holy shit NTA.\n\nThat's more than \"annoying\", thats borderline torture in Charlie's case. She's being deliberately cruel. \n\nQuite apart from the singing thing, she shouldn't be in their rooms unless invited. Kids deserve the right to privacy within their own room.", "NTA, but ending vocal lessons takes it a bit too far as the first punishment.  Yes she should face consequences.  Taking away her tablet for a set period of time is a valid and related consequence.  But taking away everything related to singing is a lot. Maybe have a conversation with her and revisit the punishment", "NTA but you being the stepmother can be sensitive. Could her dad talk to her and be the one to do the grounding if it comes to that? Or start having these talks together all 3 of you (dad, daughter and you)?It is rude and very uncomfortable that she enters the boys personal spaces but working together would be better than for you to have to take the whole responsibility of solving this when you are two adults. Good luck!", "NTA.. she is only 10, and with that comes the preteen attitude, and a lot of times, kids do things for attention. Whether it's negative or positive, it is still attention. However, she does need a consequence, I think taking her lessons away might be too harsh and cause some serious resentment. I do wonder if her grandmother is saying this. Maybe it's because your stepdaughter might have said she feels you favor your sons over her. Her behavior is drastically affecting your son, which is not acceptable because to him, her doing that is literal torture. I think there might be more than this... especially if her mother isn't in the picture. 10 years old is a hard time for a young girl. I just think she's acting out because something deeper is going on", "NAH\n\nBUT, seriously think about why your stepdaughter is behaving like this. This is a girl who from what I can tell, doesn't have bio mom around, and dad, being an archeologist, is gone for months on end, every year.\n\nHave you sat down with her, not to berate her for singing or bothering her brother, but about how she's feeling within the family unit? Kids often act out for reasons they might not even fully understand themselves and her 'wanting an audience' might just be a sign that she feels neglected or not seen in a way. She has an autistic brother who I assume, and understandably so, needs extra consideration and her other brother is at that age where family sucks. Maybe she feels unseen and she knows that being annoying gets some form of attention at least.\n\nBeing with grandma, who spoils her, allows her to be the center of attention and affection for a while, which makes sense.\n\nYou're not wrong or an asshole for not wanting her to bother her brothers but perhaps instead of just punishing, you'd get further by exploring why she's showing this behaviour and helping her learn to express her needs in a healthier way than by drawing negative attention.", "NTA. Take her table that she uses to sing. Stop the singing lessons. He right to sing ends when she encroaching and forcing it on others.", "Maybe Mya should go stay with her grandmother for a while then. Seriously, do this. Don\u2019t make it sound like you\u2019re doing it out of spite though. Suggest that it might be fun for Mya to spend a few days at grandmas for \u201cgirl time\u201d or whatever. Myas out of the house so you get a few days of peace, and at least one of them is going to learn to keep their mouth shut. It\u2019s win-win.", "Why is the kid with you if her father is gone?  Is her mom not in the picture?  Will her grandmother take her.   Living with an autistic child is not easy.", "I don't even know anymore...", "It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s acting out. She\u2019s surrounded by your family, I\u2019m sure she misses hers. One, she\u2019s probably amused by how easy she can irritate and wind up Charlie. He\u2019s an easy target. Arguing is an easy surge of dopamine. I would monitor for depression. Two, it gets the attention off her siblings and thoroughly on her. Does she get any one on one time? Find some exclusive activity to bond with her - you try to piss off people you like a whole lot less. Honestly, I would take her to a different room and try to get to the bottom of what she\u2019s feeling when she feels the need to bother Charlie. I hope she\u2019s feeling something she can\u2019t articulate instead of just wanting to be a bully. \n\nAlso what have you done for Charlie? We bought our kiddo who has autism headphones that block sound (we went to an outdoor supply store, got the kind for the gun range). Does he have a therapist who is working to reduce the effect his sister has on him, his tolerance/emotional response? \n\nFinally. You can take away things from her but more effective is rewarding her for not inflecting the behavior for a certain amount of time. Like a good behavior/gold star chart. Certain amount of stars and she gets something. Yes, controversial. This worked better for my adhd/autistic kid than punishments. Is she on the spectrum by chance?\n\nDon\u2019t raise your voice. Simply warn a consequence, follow through. Offer good behavior reward. Follow through. Have her repeat what Yoo said back to you in her own words. NAH - this sounds like a family who is struggling (she\u2019s not giving you a hard time, she\u2019s HAVING a hard time) and I think you, her and the counselor need to meet together. Have her explain why she thinks she is there so she can admit what she\u2019s doing to the counselor.", "Annoying your son's what? His pet? His friend?", "Actually, there's something off here. Archaeologists who go on digs typically have Ph.D.s yet mom here doesn't know how to spell archaeology or sons. The whole scenario seems kind of unbelievable.", "YTA.

Taking away all her ability to sing including lessons is not going to help. What you can do though is tell her that if she continues this behavior she is showing she is not mature enough to continue with them and they will be halted until she learns to be more respectful .\n\nWhat about turning a closet (if you have one large enough she can sit in), into an in home music studio that she can call her very own recording booth or something cute.

I would assume it would get hot and uncomfy for long stretches which is why I suggested her room as well (even better if you can make it in her room closet though). Might help keep the peace in your home until dad can come back and it sounds like he'll be able to get her to behave when he's back.", "He does have seizures but he has been on meds for years and hasn't had an episode since he was 3. You're probably right. I need to let go of my fears surrounding safety and get him a lock.", "You forget this is reddit where they think 3 year olds have the same minds as fully grown adults and should be able to behave themselves perfectly at all times, of course they have no problem kicking a 10 year old from her home lol", "No, but it is going to happen.", "I think the landlord reddit  could help with the soundproofing. They have good ideas", "Dad doesn\u2019t get it he\u2019s out of the country and can\u2019t be bothered", "Send a child to therapy because they\u2019re annoying someone? That\u2019s a reach.", "He doesn't have the ability to facetime. Where he is he is lucky to get signal to call and usually it's broken up. He has to use signal booster antenna's. Going away once a year and busting his ass to support his family doesn't mean he's checking out.", "Did you read the same post as the rest of us? Cause it sounds like you\u2019re pulling info out of you a$$ that was never stated. Or are you one of those that reads the first and last sentence of a post and think your view point is correct? At NO time did OP state she hates the kid. Dad does NOT travel constantly. OP stated that the kid IS in therapy. At ten the kid knows what buttons to push and she is using all ten fingers to make sure she\u2019s hitting ALL the buttons. Poor child my a$$!", "Do you think all step parents are horrible?  No where in this post does it sound like she hates her step daughter.", "Where does OP even imply she doesn't like the kid? She's allowed to be frustrated with her Step Daughter going out of her way to upset her step brothers and going beyond the realm of normal siblings pettiness.\n\nThat doesn't mean op doesn't like her? Ops even paying for the singing lessons. Why would she do that if she didn't like the kid?!", "I definitely understand the fear surrounding seizures; my sister hasn't had one in a while and I still worry about if she might have one again. It's terrifying. But in the interest of everyone's safety, your son needs a way to keep his step-sister out of his room, and an easily breakable eye-hook isn't going to cut it.\n\nLike I said, you could always make sure to have a spare key for emergencies. Perhaps keep it on a bracelet or something that you'll always have on you? And definitely somewhere your step-daughter can't get it.\n\nHonestly, you sound like a loving and supportive mom. Being a step-parent can be difficult, and I'm glad your husband is on your side. I hope things work out for you.", "Pro tip I used when my kids were younger: get a keyed lock rather than indoor lock, but match it to the front door (quickset locks are easy to rekey but a locksmith can rekey anything). That way you already have a key on your keychain. I got him a red key for his door, no-one ever noticed it was the same as the house key.", "There are all different kinds. And I don\u2019t know where you live, but some health plans will partially reimburse for safety devices, like locks and alarms. Good luck.", "You need to look some words up. Like \u201dautism\u201d and \u201cmeltdown\u201d and \u201cempathy.\u201d Then maybe watch some videos, do some research on why a girl in a blended family might be suddenly acting out like this\u2026 oh, and maybe how therapy isn\u2019t punishment.   \n\n\nDo most of you on here ever get out into the real world? Or are you very young? Both of those are rhetorical, btw.", "Well you first called it his little \u201cmission\u201d which sounds VERY different than busting his ass. \n\nAlso it may be once a year but it\u2019s for months.", "And also you said kick the kid out? And I\u2019m not saying what the child did wasn\u2019t bad. Frankly horrible. But I don\u2019t think therapy is gonna help it? Just tell her \u201cYou can\u2019t annoy so-snd-so because it\u2019s mean etc. If that doesn\u2019t change you\u2019ll have stuff taken away.\u201d A much better solution than what your comment said.", "Therapy isn\u2019t a punishment. A neutral place where she can talk about why she\u2019s unwilling to respect boundaries might be a good thing. THERAPY ISNT A PUNISHMENT. It\u2019s a safety net.", "And also get her out of the house does not mean \u201ckick her out this second.\u201d Do you understand the word \u201cif?\u201d Do you understand the gravity of what\u2019s happening? You obviously don\u2019t grasp therapy, counting, or narrative structure. Good luck with\u2026 everything.", "Eviction *is* punishment and at ten an insane and illegal one.", "Where do people get that idea?", "and\u2026 another. Do some of you read only every fifth or sixth word?"]}
