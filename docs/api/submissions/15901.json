She\u2019s not a bad friend, she\u2019s actually pretty great, but she flirts with guys that like her for her own interest, and she often uses them for money etc. Now D, the guy that likes/liked her, is a very sweet guy, he\u2019s fun to talk to but also has money. D liked M for quite a while but she\u2019s obsessed with her ex who broke up with her at beginning of the year. \n\nCouple of days ago, M came to school mentally feeling like shit so I texted D asking what happened yesterday when they were outside. Later he asked me to ask her about him, how she feels about him etc. He also asked me to tell him everything she says about him. So I did. She used him for money and stuff, me and my friends told him about it.M also ghosted him and later said, I quote \u201cI don\u2019t like him much so I can and fuck it\u201d and similar stuff.\n\nYesterday M and D talked, and he knows everything I told him, so he told her that he knew. So que that, she got mad and said that she didn\u2019t say any of it, and started talking shit about me to our mutal friends. One of them texted D and said that \u201c*my name* is fake as fuck because M didn\u2019t say any of it\u201d when he wasn\u2019t there. So pretty much she said I and our friends lied to D because \u201c*me* likes him\u201d which I don\u2019t. She just started telling gossip about me so the blame for what she did.\n\nD admitted that he belives me and not M because she treats him like crap. I apologised to both D and M because I feel guilty but she still treats me like crap.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1682678611, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131o2vj/aita_for_telling_a_guy_who_likes_my_friend_what/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
