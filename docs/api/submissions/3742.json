Come on, the guy cheated! Even if he did something \"less bad\", but the daughter was still hurt by him, that would be enough reason not to invite him. Also, why didn't they mention it?

You should have called from the driveway and said look mom, I'm not coming in until he leaves. End of discussion. What they did was grossly inappropriate.

Immediately after sending block every single family member you have that you\u2019ve had issues with.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong, it was actually really courageous of you to stand your ground and leave. Drop those \u2018friends\u2019 they aren\u2019t your friends. NTA", "Nta\n\nDefinitely.   I'd go  nc", "NTA you need some new friends. They all planned this to push you into a reconciliation. geez you moved 4 hours away that should have been the first clue you were done with him. Your parents were wrong for ambushing you and ex was a huge AH for going along with it. I would not be going back at Christmas if they ask.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have even gone inside. Cut them off.", "NTA but everyone else in your story is. From your parents to your friends. F*** your parents and ex and f*** the friend that said you should\u2019ve stayed. I hope the new year brings fabulous things for you.", "Most parents would never forgive someone who hurt their kid and disrespected their kid like that, regardless of whether you personally forgave him or not. NTA, I'm sorry your parents prioritised him over you. I get the impression they have a history of throwing you under the bus.", "Ok for a movement lets agree io OP father.\n\nMy dad stops me and tells me\" I am being childish for leaving and not facing up to my ex since he clearly wants forgiveness.\"\n\nBut on second thought if OP is being childish then OP Father can show maturity and show support for his own daughter and do not escalate this scenerio by calling asshole and hurting OP more.\n\nIts very normal for most of ppl calling others childish hypocritically when OP parents r so immature to invite a person to dinner who hurt their daughter.\n\nI mean what kiddish of logic is that?????\n\nNTA OP, Dont feel guilty for ur reaction.", "Nta wtf parents", "NTA and YTA", "NTA and what exactly were your parents trying to accomplish here? What did they expect to happen? Why would they allow the person who *broke their daughter's heart* to even set foot on their property? \n\nTonedeaf,  insensitive and just plain selfish of them to do that to you.", "NTA at all. Your parents are, and the audacity of the cheater is stunning.\n\nYou did well standing up for yourself.", "Everyone in this situation is AH except you. The break up is just 2 months, it's still fresh. \n\nOP, yout family is awful. They seem like choose your cheating ex over you, just move on and ditch them too.", "NTA. Everyone else, though. I mean all of them.", "You are the top comment, you may want to add NTA", "Your \"friends\" are not your friends.", "You should get rid of any friends that don\u2019t support you here. You are 100% in the right. And also definitely LC or NC with parents for a while. That\u2019s quite a transgression.", "That is bs. Your parents are cruel and disloyal to you. I would stop making the four hour drive.", "That is a ridiculous position. There is something wrong with those people. Notice that those of us who are objective, i. e. hundreds of people here, don't agree. You definitely should have left.", "Uh no. You have no obligation to subject yourself to that situation and they were terribly cruel to invite him. If they had even remotely honest intentions here, they would have told you that he was invited and let you decide beforehand. This is not a well intentioned mistake, this is over cruelty on their part and even if it was a mistake you\u2019d still be warranted in not attending. Anyone who would tell you otherwise is not your friend. This is not even remotely controversial", "An invitation is not a royal summons.  It requires your consent, and consent can be withdrawn at any time.  You withdrew your consent to accept their invite when you discovered that the circumstances were not what you'd been led to believe, and so you left.\n\nNothing assholish about declining an invitation that was extended deceptively.  There's something to be said, etiquette-wise, for sticking it out when you RSVP yes, and that's probably what your not-really-friends are thinking about when they chastise you.  It's rude to RSVP yes and then decline afterward, in the absence of a radical emergency, and the closer to the event it becomes, the ruder it is to change a yes to a no.  But that goes out the window when your hosts lie to you about the conditions of the event, and you discover at the last second what the real conditions are.  In this case, the lie was too big and the conditions too intolerable for you, and you were within your rights to decline once you discovered the real situation.\n\nIn other words, you didn't behave in a rude fashion.  An invitation is not a royal summons and consent is not just for sex.", "They weren't \"hosting\", they were \"ambushing\".", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think this is a reasonable explanation because any rational person who went through multiple events of cheating in their relationship and got past it would understand the blood sweat and tears required to forgive and also the work on the part of the cheater to do better which your ex clearly does not seem capable of. I genuinely do not think this flippant attitude comes from a place of firsthand understanding.", "I wouldn't hold your breath. Your parents sound awful and I'm so sorry they did this to you. If you never talked to them again it would be reasonable", "I hope that you also dropped those \u201cfriends\u201d who slept with him. It definitely seems time for a reckoning on who you stay friends with. Having toxic people in your life is never worth it"]}
