Come on, the guy cheated! Even if he did something \"less bad\", but the daughter was still hurt by him, that would be enough reason not to invite him. Also, why didn't they mention it?

You should have called from the driveway and said look mom, I'm not coming in until he leaves. End of discussion. What they did was grossly inappropriate.
