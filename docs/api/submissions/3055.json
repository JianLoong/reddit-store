He has set the tone for all future family events gatherings. Stand your ground, your wife may say it\u2019s okay but I promise you it will hurt her in ways you and I could never understand. \n\nI speak from experience, my father disowned me and refused to meet my husband or kids because of my husband\u2019s skin color. We celebrated holidays with my mother and sister either before or after the actual holiday and although my husband said he was fine with it I know it hurt.

Are they going to not invite your wife, son, and any other future children to Christmas?

I understand why your wife is telling you just to go to keep the peace, she probably feels responsible in some way even though she isn't, but I can't wrap my head around why other family members are siding with the couple. Do they not recognise the word used as a slur? Do they think you embellished your side of the story? Do they think they are protecting her from other bigots on the guest list?

I can almost guarantee she doesn\u2019t. Why should your wife be made to sit thru that?\n\nAsk your wife how she feels about the whole situation.

You don\u2019t pick and choose your family members, whether they\u2019re by marriage or blood. That said, you don\u2019t have to be around people who would treat your wife like that.

With the -a, not the -er. He got a very stern (if slightly tipsy) talking to and by the end of it he was like \"you're right, I'm so sorry, if this ever happens again please break up with me.\" And just the other day he helped me explain to his friend why neither of them (both Puerto Rican) can say it. Growth is possible when the folks getting called out give a shit about being better. \n\nThat being said, fuck this guy's sister. Racist trash just like her fiance.", "Agreed. It all depends on their intent and mindset. If they were simply raised to not know any better about some things but will happily improve and change then that\u2019s not an issue", "Complicit spellcheck sucks ;)", "When first asked about your wife's invitation, your sister immediately directed you to her husband. It's a sign that it wasn't her idea, but the implication is that she didn't fight for you, she didn't see anything wrong with that. What made your sister overlook such a big waving red flag? What made her so complicit to a bigot, of all people? Is BIL rich?", "You are doing the right thing standing with your wife, and against bigotry. I would only like to offer one piece of advice (advice which may be as well received as advising your sister not to marry this jagoff)\u2026 I suspect she is about to marry an abuser. It is unlikely anyone will be able to convince her of this..\n\nso, my advice to you is: do not shame her so that she begins to see only him as safe refuge. Tell her you love her and that you will always stand up for what is right and in defense of the ones you love\u2026and that includes her. When she\u2019s ready to do the same.", "She can see he is racist.  She accepts that about him and is marrying her racist.", "Either that, or she has so many stars in her eyes over this guy that she is willing to throw away the values she was raised with in order to stay on his good side. \n\nSadly, as he is a bigot, that is an indicator that he is not worth throwing herself away in order to stay on his good side. She is backing the wrong horse here.", "That's really helpful thank you! I just... it made me feel a bit like I was losing my mind, it was said so rationally and calmly. I can't explain it. Anyway thank you!", "Well the first was my response, I was like I've had to deal and put up with racism since I was a kid in school (by teachers no less). I don't feel it's my responsibility to educate them and expose myself to that to make someone who hates me for no reason \"better\". The person backed off but in this kind of way that's like I thought you were a better person than that. I mean... I don't know. It was strange.", "Not really. His mom and dad did a shit job raising him and now I have chosen to deal with their failures. If he wasn't trying to better himself I would leave.", "I'm glad it was helpful. I get what you're talking about, though. I had to shut up and listen a few times to understand why that is a bad approach to take in being \"supportive of my friends experiences\".", "It absolutely isn't your responsibility. It's 100% shitty of them to think that it is :/", "Thank you for all that, and for the resources! It's great to have someone articulate something that feels so bad but is treated as normal."]}
