He has set the tone for all future family events gatherings. Stand your ground, your wife may say it\u2019s okay but I promise you it will hurt her in ways you and I could never understand. \n\nI speak from experience, my father disowned me and refused to meet my husband or kids because of my husband\u2019s skin color. We celebrated holidays with my mother and sister either before or after the actual holiday and although my husband said he was fine with it I know it hurt.

Are they going to not invite your wife, son, and any other future children to Christmas?

I understand why your wife is telling you just to go to keep the peace, she probably feels responsible in some way even though she isn't, but I can't wrap my head around why other family members are siding with the couple. Do they not recognise the word used as a slur? Do they think you embellished your side of the story? Do they think they are protecting her from other bigots on the guest list?

I can almost guarantee she doesn\u2019t. Why should your wife be made to sit thru that?\n\nAsk your wife how she feels about the whole situation. If she is willing to interact with people so racist even cordially it would be for you. But as her husband it is your job to protect her.

And family members supporting your sisters choice are contributing to racism as well.", "NTA ... sad your sister is supporting the decision of her fiance so passively", "Why go to a wedding of racist? Definitely NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even go to any family events with them there anymore either.", "NTA at all and stick by your decision not to attend.\nI shouldn\u2019t be surprised but I\u2019m still wondering why people have your BIL\u2019s mindset in 2022.\nHe is an arsehole of note and your sister is one for knowingly marrying a racist.\nThis is just the beginning of the trouble, guaranteed he will try to exclude your wife and son from further family functions especially if they host.", "Spoiler alert, I think you know now that your sister is also a racist. NTA", "NTA\n\nGood for you and your parents (and any other family member) for supporting your wife. \n\nYour future BIL is not only T A but also a racist. And your sister (I'm sorry to say but) might be one too, because she being ok with this is a major tell.\n\nGood luck and update us if you can.", "NTA. But honestly I'd go to to and make a speech about how racist her fiance is", "NTA at all. If your sister decides to marry a racist AH, she has to accept the consequences.", "Just tell your sister you don't hang with racists and refuse to \"mix\" with their kind as racism seems to be an infectious disease.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Showing up at that wedding means you accept racism.  Your sister can have her white wedding with his family.", "NTA", "GTFOH! You are NTA, your sister is a coward AND TA along with her fianc\u00e9.\n\nMy hubs and I are the same in that if one of us isn\u2019t invited, the other doesn\u2019t go. Anywhere. We are a package deal. We may not always go to everything together, but that\u2019s our choice, not per an invite. \n\nTo deliberately snub your longtime life partner (first friend/gf now wife), who has been accepted for years by your family, because she will be the only POC - and by God to call her a \u201cblackie\u201d - is as racist as can be. And this is a hill I\u2019d be willing to die on as well. I\u2019m glad your parents and g parents are as vocal in their support. Much respect to them. I hope your sister grows up and becomes more open minded, and even moreso I hope that if she does, you\u2019re able to salvage some sort of relationship. Otherwise you\u2019re not missing out on much.", "NTA 100%.", "I'm sorry for the loss of your sister, she's too far gone. NTA", "NTA. Reading this has made me feel sick to the stomach. I am so glad you, your parents, and your grandparents are not attending your sister's wedding. Please go NC if she insists on marrying this racist. \nOh, and not only is the fiance a gigantic RACIST, but so is your sister! If she stands by and supports this and goes through with the wedding, she's as bad as he is. \nI hope your wife is ok. I can only imagine how she must be feeling.", "NTA Your sister is marrying a racist. She's not standing up for your wife either, so perhaps she is a racist as well. Same with everyone who is taking her side.", "NTA. If she wants to throw her life away with a racist, I wouldn't support it or be there either. Picking a shitty spouse comes with consequences. If she doesn't like the consequences, she needs to dump him.\n\nKeep track of all the racist family members, so you can cut them out of your life.\n\nTf kind of 1950s US segregation is he trying to pull..", "NTA. Begin how you intend to continue. You\u2019re not in the wrong.", "NTA but your sister sure is for even going along with this and moving forward in life with that racist person. It just shows where she is at and it's disgusting. I understand why your wife doesn't want to draw attention and make waves but, she was apart of the family first. This is way beyond inexcusable and unacceptable and your sister/other family needs to realize that. They didn't have a problem before. They only have a problem now because her racist fianc\u00e9 has a problem? There is no reason to even attend when you cannot support the marriage and bringing this jerk into the family.", "NTA. They shouldn't be mad at OP, but supporting him. Instead of going to sister's wedding have a nice get together of their own. Sister is allowed to marry someone blatantly racist. Everyone else is allowed to decide to not associate with this raging ahole.", "NTA \n\nWhat did I just read? What century are we in? I thought we went through a time warp there. \n\nMy friend, you are 100% in the clear here.  As a person in an interracial marriage as well I am outraged right along with you! I can\u2019t believe your sister (and the other family members siding with her) is supporting racism towards her own SIL. \n\nWay to go in showing off your rock\nhard spine! \ud83d\udc8eAnd mad props to your parents and grandparents also who stand against racism! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "If you knowingly marry a racist, you're a racist. NTA", "WTF, are all your family (except parents) racist assholes?  If I heard that anyone wasn't invited because they'd be the 'only blackie' I'd boycott that wedding and air that dirty laundry all over fiance's social media.  Can't let racists roam free without consequences.", "The only assholes in this situation are the racist and the people enabling him. NTA. I hope your sister sees the light and doesn\u2019t marry that poor excuse of a human.", "NTA, I'm sorry you found out your sister is rascist.", "Definitely NTA but at least you now know who are the racist assholes are in your family.", "Absolutely NTA die on this hill. I will say you may want to consider that you no longer have a sister. If she can marry this monster who feels this way about SIL and nephew she's at minimum condoning the thoughts. Also racism is taught so expect any children born from this to be racist as well.", "He\u2019s a racist. Why indulge your sis. She\u2019s not speaking up for her or you. That\u2019s her choice. Good riddance!", "NTA in any way shape or form.  Your soon to be BIL is a racist.  The family members who are telling you to go without your wife are racist.\n\nYou are absolutely right in not going without your wife.  But at this point, do you really want to go and celebrate your sister marrying a racist?  I wouldn't want to be in the same room as this guy (I'm white) and wouldn't want to do anything with him.  If that means going NC with him and your sister, just keep in mind that she married him knowing he's a racist.", "NTA \u2026 OMG anyone who aligns with your FBIL are racist and they can keep to their own side, do t mix with trash including your sister that thinks this is ok", "NTA\n\nYou are an awesome husband.  That said, every single person that has sided with your BIL are major AH's.  Not just major AH's, but raging racists to boot.  The fact that your sister is ok with marrying a racist is absolutely disgusting as well.  Not only would I not go, but I would cut contact off with your sister just because she is ok with her fianc\u00e9 being a racist.", "NTA, be thankful all the racists are making themselves known... It'll be easier for you to go NC with them", "NTA. And good for your parents and grandparents to stand up for you and your wife!", "Considering she's alright with the issue, I'm less worried for her sake that she's marrying a racist - sounds like she is one too.", "How about the fact that the sister is ALSO A RACIST!\n\nBy supporting this behavior, you are a racist as well since you see nothing wrong with it. Moreover, she didn\u2019t shut down the racist remark made by the fianc\u00e9.\n\nOP go NC with the sister and the family who support the sister. They are all racist AH. And you don\u2019t want to subject your future kids to the racist likes of them.\n\nNTA. But the racist family sure is", "Really tell sis she ain't family no more.", "Sister clearly is supporting it. She knows who she is marrying. I would not want to see her again.", "Totally agree. It sounds like the OP has made this the hill to die on", "When you have enough people telling you something, it's hard not to doubt yourself. I'd rather they ask than just assume they have to put up with this crap!", "Well, his entire family save for his parents are on his sister\u2019s side, and finding out almost your entire extended family is racist when you yourself are in an interracial marriage can definitely be\u2026 stressful to say the least. It\u2019s not surprising he\u2019s second guessing everything right now.", "In fairness, op's family for the most part are telling him that he is TA here", "I mean, it's good evidence I suppose. I'd be that petty that I would print out the replies on here and send it as an RSVP", "Right!?! I can't believe the word \"blackie\" came out of his mouth. I'd have knocked his bloody teeth in.\n\nWow.", "Extended family reasoning - yes the fBIL is racist but that's your sister and BUT FAMILLYYYYYYY \\*hurls\\*\n\nWife's reasoning - Assuming She's African or West Indies in culture, family counts for a lot and while she's very much hurt she doesn't want to come between OP and his family/sister because THAT is how things will be painted. Not all of us have the steel to fight this sort of fight when familial ties are involved vs friends/coworkers.", "I have to wonder if the sister even understands what this means overall. Every holiday, every birthday, EVERY family get together is now going to be split by this man. The family dynamics will be changed forever. It's so sad.\n\nNTA OP, stay strong and good luck navigating the new terrain.", "Make good trouble.   (to paraphrase the late great Rep. Lewis)", "This, OP, THIS!!", "She\u2019s either scared of him or she\u2019s actually racist too and I\u2019m leaning toward racist because wtf.", "I am not pushing for an invite anymore,I want my wife to be respected by my family and I want an apology", "Wait, you\u2019re saying OP is TH? Or NTA?", "Id boycott it too.", "Yes! So many stories like this on AITA where the parents support the asshole. Very nice to see parents on the right side. NTA op", "Oh she is. Lay down with bigots and you're a bigot. It's that simple. \nThis should have been sisters hill to die on. Instead she sacrificed her sibling and parents on it. \n\nFuck bigots, never compromise", "NTA her fiancee is racist and do what is best for you by not attending your sister's wedding", "But I wonder about the parents tho\u2026if one of my daughters pulled this shit I probably wouldn\u2019t be attending their wedding. I would be absolutely livid.", "Good. \nThis 'blackie', supports this choice", "Lol sorry, fixed it", "I mean, it says right in the post the parents and grandparents said they aren\u2019t going to the wedding\u2026", "Oh ok good haha that\u2019s what I thought you meant but I was a little confused lol \ud83d\ude02"]}
