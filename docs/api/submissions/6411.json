He takes care of the house chores while I work. His sister (f22) came to stay with us a few weeks ago because of a fight she had with her parents. Neither wanted to tell us what happened. I didn't want her here. She isn't in school, doesn't work, doesn't do anything to help with chores, is a spoiled brat, acts entitled etc. I only agreed to let her stay here for a week. It's been 6 weeks. I honestly can't stand to live with her anymore. She makes a mess everywhere, has parties when me and hubby aren't home, plays music on max volume till 4 am, she's rude, breaks stuff, disrespects all my boundaries and house rules.\u00a0 Finances aren't good either with the extra expenses.\u00a0\n\n\nLast night I sat them down and told them that she needs to leave in a week because I'm done. I haven't had a real night sleep in 6 weeks, the apartment is a mess because my husband can't keep up with the mess she makes and I'm reaching rock bottom with the expensise. He asked if I would let her stay if she would get a job and I said yes. That would mean she won't have the energy to stay up till 4am and make a mess and she will also contribute financially. She ran out screaming that she isn't getting a job and I'm a bitch.\u00a0\n\n\nI called MIL and asked her again why they had a fight. She's pregnant. Baby daddy disappeared into the night when he heard the news. She expected her parents to provide and they said no so she came here. I told my husband and he was shocked but said we can't kick her out now. I said yes we can and we are. I will not be financially responsible for her anymore. I will not be financially responsible for her child. I will not have a child in my home. I strongly dislike kids. I don't need the noise, the mess, the smell, the extra expenses. Hubby said he understands that I don't want any of this but we can't kick her out because she has nowhere to go since his parents won't let her move back home.\u00a0\n\n\nI simply said either she goes or I go.\n\n\n\u00a0I'm sick of him enabling her behavior. He always makes excuses for her. He bends backwards for her. Well I'm not going to. She is an adult. She isn't in school. She doesn't work. She wants to have a baby? Ok. Then she needs to grow up and provide for herself. She isn't disabled, sick, mentally incapacitated or anything else that would stop her from working. She just doesn't want to work. Her parents spoiled too much when she was younger and now she thinks the world revolves around her.\n\n\nMy friends and my in-laws agree with me, but my parents say I'm TA for kicking out a pregnant girl and making my husband choose between me and her.\n\n\nI'm not changing my decision no matter what. If she's not out in a week I will be.\n\n\nBut I'm curious if I'm TA.", "created_utc": 1672788288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102n1nk/aita_for_kicking_out_my_husbands_pregnant_sister/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your being the breadwinner is only okay of your husband is actually taking care of the house. He\u2019s letting his sister ruin your home and sanity.", "NTA. \n\nIf your parents say you're TA, then let them take care of her themselves.

It sounds like six weeks of hell, neither you nor your husband are maids or carers I would do the same.", "NTA.  Thankfully, you provided a lot of detail about what environment you are living in.  It is unfortunate that it has come to this, but it is not fair for you to carry the financial burden for a freeloading relative, pregnant or not.  In fact, if she is partying while pregnant, the baby will likely have all sorts of cognitive and physical issues that will require more care and financial resources.  \n\nThe fact that she is not in anyway trying to provide financially and actually treats you with contempt even though you have been helping her is also another reason to give this ultimatum, as things will only get worse once a baby is born.  If she is this devoid of responsibility, you and your husband will become the default parents, and you have already indicated that is not what you want.\n\nDo print out a list of shelters and non-profits that provide services for unwed, single mothers and give to her, giving her time to find her next home.", "NTA I mean fuck her own parents won\u2019t put up with her shit why should you.

He\u2019s enabling her spoilt behavior. She\u2019s pregnant, making it even more important that she gets a job ASAP. How is she going to financially support this tiny human dependent on her??

Your SIL is a leech, your husband is an AH and your parents are delusional, as it seems they think this will make you change your mind on kids.\n\nI don't like ultimatums, but this is an example where one is completely needed, and now that you told your husband you need to be firm and don't relent. Because of you go back, your SIL will make her life your problem, and you'll end up maintaining a household of 4 people, while your husband sits on his ass and dances to his sister's music, while she continues to be the selfish and entitled AH she is.\n\nGood luck, OP, hope everything goes well for you.", "NTA. Hubby is for enabling her.", "It sounds like OP's hubby AND his pregnant sister are going to be homeless, given that 1)neither of them have a job, 2) at least one of them has no intention of getting a job, and 3) OP is the sole support of the other 2.\n\nOP, you are absolutely correct in delivering the ultimatum.  They can keep each other company in a homeless shelter.\n\nNTA", "NTA usually I am wary of ultimatums- they are inherently a breaking point and there isn't a lot you can do to walk them back. But you are there, this is the breaking part. He *knew*, that's why he refused to tell you what her fight had been about. He fully intended to try and twist your arm into letting her stay permanently and taking on her and her child. The fact is he does have to choose- if he wants to support his sister unconditionally then that's his road to walk, not yours, and trying to manipulate you into that is unacceptable.", "NTA You are not responsible for her, she needs to grow up and quickly if she\u2019s keeping her baby.", "Take the word 'pregnant' out if it and what would be stopping you?  NTA.", "NTA. Tell your parents they can have her.", "Of course not. But I wouldn't have even give the ultimatum. I would have been so freaking out of there dude. NTA!!!! Hold your boundary!", "Nta.

If you are nice, you help her with directions to a shelter, preferably one with social workers attached.", "NTA.  Are you supposed to be responsible for every pregnant girl or just this one? Her own parents don't want to help her because they realize they created an entitled monster. I always find it funny when people  who are down on their luck feel entitled to others help instead of being grateful for it. I believe in helping people but I don't  believe in enabling ungrateful entitled human beings.  SIL is not ready to be a parent. Don't make taking care of her your responsibility. Also maybe your parents should offer her a place to stay sense they feel so adamant about you not kicking her out.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to go.\n\nAnd if you rent an apartment (no outside landscaping or maintenance chores), there's really no reason your husband couldn't have a part-time job at least.", "NTA", "NTA but goddamn the audacity of those two to put everything on you is insane. You made a proper choice while giving her plenty of time and your money, sorry it got to this and goodluck", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s entitled and oh-so-rude, but also scared and on her own for the first time in her life. She\u2019s undoubtedly an AH, but I think her parents take top AH points here for raising her to be this lazy and entitled and then kicking her out when she\u2019s pregnant.\n\nYour husband is an AH less for wanting to help his sister, but mostly for letting the entire financial burden fall on you, and for not being able, between him and his sister, to \u2018keep up with the mess she makes\u2019. I mean, come on. He\u2019s also an AH for expecting her to be able to stay without having reinforced any boundaries or rules.\n\nTell him he needs to step up. In the areas of boundary enforcement, mutual decision-making, and perhaps even financial contributions. And this is a general need to step up, not conditions for letting her stay. She still needs to go.\n\nTell your parents they\u2019re welcome to take SIL in if they feel that strongly about your decision.\n\n100% stick to your ultimatum and be gone next week if she\u2019s not.
