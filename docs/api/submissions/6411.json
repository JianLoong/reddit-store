He takes care of the house chores while I work. His sister (f22) came to stay with us a few weeks ago because of a fight she had with her parents. Neither wanted to tell us what happened. I didn't want her here. She isn't in school, doesn't work, doesn't do anything to help with chores, is a spoiled brat, acts entitled etc. I only agreed to let her stay here for a week. It's been 6 weeks. I honestly can't stand to live with her anymore. She makes a mess everywhere, has parties when me and hubby aren't home, plays music on max volume till 4 am, she's rude, breaks stuff, disrespects all my boundaries and house rules.\u00a0 Finances aren't good either with the extra expenses.\u00a0\n\n\nLast night I sat them down and told them that she needs to leave in a week because I'm done. I haven't had a real night sleep in 6 weeks, the apartment is a mess because my husband can't keep up with the mess she makes and I'm reaching rock bottom with the expensise. He asked if I would let her stay if she would get a job and I said yes. That would mean she won't have the energy to stay up till 4am and make a mess and she will also contribute financially. She ran out screaming that she isn't getting a job and I'm a bitch.\u00a0\n\n\nI called MIL and asked her again why they had a fight. She's pregnant. Baby daddy disappeared into the night when he heard the news. She expected her parents to provide and they said no so she came here. I told my husband and he was shocked but said we can't kick her out now. I said yes we can and we are. I will not be financially responsible for her anymore. I will not be financially responsible for her child. I will not have a child in my home. I strongly dislike kids. I don't need the noise, the mess, the smell, the extra expenses. Hubby said he understands that I don't want any of this but we can't kick her out because she has nowhere to go since his parents won't let her move back home.\u00a0\n\n\nI simply said either she goes or I go.\n\n\n\u00a0I'm sick of him enabling her behavior. He always makes excuses for her. He bends backwards for her. Well I'm not going to. She is an adult. She isn't in school. She doesn't work. She wants to have a baby? Ok. Then she needs to grow up and provide for herself. She isn't disabled, sick, mentally incapacitated or anything else that would stop her from working. She just doesn't want to work. Her parents spoiled too much when she was younger and now she thinks the world revolves around her.\n\n\nMy friends and my in-laws agree with me, but my parents say I'm TA for kicking out a pregnant girl and making my husband choose between me and her.\n\n\nI'm not changing my decision no matter what.

He fully intended to try and twist your arm into letting her stay permanently and taking on her and her child.

I believe in helping people but I don't  believe in enabling ungrateful entitled human beings.  SIL is not ready to be a parent. Don't make taking care of her your responsibility.

Her response of running out of rhe room screaming she isnt going to get a job tells you she has zero intention of working, period.  She is so entitled, she expects you. To support her and her child while she does nothing.  Millions of women work when pregnant, even when they have kids.  She should be working as much as possible before the baby gets here..  You support your husband already.   If he wants to help jer perhaps.be could get a job and send her money HE has earned.  And since your parents are so concerned maybe she should live with them.", "NTA\n\nShe has no business having a kid.

They can figure their shit out together.", "Not at all. She needs to go", "Do you own the house or a part of it? If not, walk out the door and do not go back.

Stop giving him a choice and get the fuck out of there. NTA", "NTA, NTA, NTA. Stick to your hard boundaries. If she's not gone in a week then you leave. If you do leave get your name of the lease or report her to the landlord so they can evict her. She's an adult and needs to figure out her situation fast. She's looking for you to be her bank and child care. Do not enable her behavior. Realize that if you do have to leave your home then you need to talk to a lawyer about your legal options in regards to your marriage.", "NTA. You should leave, as it seems that your husband has made his choice. You are too young to be enslaved to this messed up family. \n\nLet your unemployed husband manage a household, his useless and pregnant sister, look after an innocent baby who\u2019ll be born into this mess and clean hp after his sister and future nephew/niece.", "NTA.\n\nTime to ready the boot, OP.", "Nta, why doesn\u2019t your husband have a job and if he didn\u2019t want to kick his sister out why doesn\u2019t he get one now?

Otherwise, she'll keep this behavior up after the baby is born.", "Whoa whoa whoa.  Why should OP leave?  She's the one paying for everything.  If it comes to divorce, stay in your own damn house, OP.  Change the WiFi passwords, and passwords for streaming services, gaming subscriptions, music service etc.  Take away everything that makes it fun to be home and unemployed.  Rip out and hide the cables to the speakers or otherwise disable them.  you need your sleep.  Find her a women's shelter and pack up all her belongings.  Put her out of the house ASAP before she gets rights as a tenant or whatever, making it more complicated because then you have to legally evict her.  Your marriage is probably over. Your husband can stay with his parents.  Get a good lawyer. You don't want to end up having to pay spousal support for your ex.  And other commenters are right...your parents disapprove of you wanting to kick her out?  Well they can take her and her precious bundle of joy to be into their house ASAP.\n\nNTA op. Everyone else in this story seems to be one though...by varying degrees.", "I would speak to a lawyer sooner rather than later. And what's your living situation? Do you own or rent can you get out of your lease? He's never going to let her go. NTA.", "NTA, but it sounds like you have two mooches here. You will be T A to yourself if you don't leave. Your husband has stood by and let this happen because it bothers you more than him because you're the one that actually has to keep a schedule", "NTA\n\nThis is the hill on which you make a stand. \n\nConsult an attorney about a legal separation.\n\nIf your unemployed husband chooses his sister, ask the attorney about the feasibility of evicting both of them.\n\nSometimes you have to be the black hat to be the white hat for yourself.", "NTA. \n\nShe doesn't want to work because of no reason,  that's a big NOPE. \n\nShe's pregnant and partying until 4am, really?\n\nI would kick out the lazy, spoiled, brat too.

Only question is, why are you bothering to wait a week? He's not going to magically see the light. He's leaching off you and now she is too.

If she doesn't want to work, why tf would she think having a baby is any better? Mom should offer her a one time Get Out of Jail Free card, take her to a clinic and say, \"Here's your reset. Get a job, an apt, and grow up.\"\n\nI know that sounds harsh, but there's no need for her to become even more of a leech on society, or to ruin that poor child's life.

I get him not wanting to throw his pregnant sister out on the streets. That would be tough for anyone to do.", "How many leeches from that family are you going to support? NTA. SIL needs to go and DH needs to get a job or he goes with her.", "Pretty much this. \nHonestly I don\u2019t feel I need to even explain to OP why she\u2019s NTA. After reading every sentence of her argument I was instinctively nodding along. \nSIL wants to be a parent, OP does not. The in-laws aren\u2019t willing to provide (and kudos to them for backing DIL OP), so she needs to provide for herself. She doesn\u2019t have a valid reason not to.

Its very easy to pretend to be empathetic when you have to deal with none of the insane behavior of SIL.", "Yup. OP you 100% didn't sign up for this. SIL thought when she moved in that she can do whatever she wants and be a terrible houseguest because she's betting that you'd never kick out a pregnant woman. Well she found out otherwise. NTA", "A thing that's tripping me up in the original post and some of the comments is the way folks are referring to SIL as a \"girl\" when she is, in fact, a full twenty two years old. It feels like she's committed to performing the role of helpless \"girl\" to avoid taking any responsibility for herself and her choices--not life circumstances. Literal choices. Obviously I don't know the circumstances surrounding her pregnancy, so I couldn't say that for certain, but based on OP, husband's, and their parents' behavior, it seems like this is the natural consequence of enabling someone for this long.", "OP should make sure to speak to the landlord, if they're renting. If she leaves, it's probably hit or miss whether her husband will manage to pay rent, and an eviction would ruin her credit. \n\nIn this situation I might make one last attempt to reason with SIL. Sit down with her, girl to girl, and outline the kinds of help I'd be able to offer: \n\n* help paying for an abortion, a ride to the clinic, chocolate and movies after. \n* help packing up her things, and a ride to the women's mission, where there will be social workers who can get her into the pipeline for subsidized housing, healthcare, food stamps, WIC\n* help identifying a reputable private adoption agency, one that can help her with expenses before the delivery\n\nAssuming that she doesn't like those options, I'd feel pretty confident that I had done all I reasonably could and I'd get my name off the lease and move out.", "100 percent thinking of the future child, the quicker the SIL receives some tough damn love the better off they all will be.", "Why do you talk about those programs as if they are some sort of horrible thing?", "So list them.", "This is the perfect response. OP is not the asshole in the slightest. She was being taken advantage of by SIL", "Yup and at this point the fetus is the least annoying out of the bunch. Even when topside. At least the baby has an excuse for no job and making messes. What's hubby and sissies excuse?", "You\u2019ve put into words what I wanted to say!", "Me too. Go OP!! You're making good decisions!!", "More like the nearest clinic, she has no business bringing a child into the world.", "They will have a lot of friends at the consignment store.", "I can give the ILs the benefit of the doubt, maybe they didn\u2019t want to tell them without SIL telling them, but after seeing what OP gone through, they decided to tell her", "They told when OP asked, but before that it was the sister's duty to tell OP and husband about this, since she clearly planned to stay with them til the baby was born and probably beyond. She was clearly hoping to oops-a-baby on them.\n\nBetter to kick sis out now, while she can still get an abortion or make arrangements for adoption.", ">I can't believe she put up with this for 6 friggin weeks.\n\nMy BIL was staying with us.  I was tired of him, and he couldn't take a hint.  I told him he was out at the end of October.  He didn't try to find a job.  I bought him the paper to look for one.

That burns gotta hurt!", "She\u2019s been talking to both of them for SIX WEEKS, at some point an ultimatum becomes necessary. I\u2019d agree that at the point it becomes necessary the relationship is probably already over, the damage is done. Husband has done nothing to help mitigate the situation and has made it clear he doesn\u2019t intend to. OP is the only working adult in the house, husband could have looked for a job to help financially support sister if he felt that strongly about it, but both of them fully intend to leave the financial burden to OP and continue recking up the house.", "Seems like both he and the sister plan on bumming off someone for the rest of their lives.", "Actually, there are two immature \u201cchildren\u201d - OP\u2019s husband and SIL.
