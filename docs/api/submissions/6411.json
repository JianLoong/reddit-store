He takes care of the house chores while I work. His sister (f22) came to stay with us a few weeks ago because of a fight she had with her parents. Neither wanted to tell us what happened. I didn't want her here. She isn't in school, doesn't work, doesn't do anything to help with chores, is a spoiled brat, acts entitled etc. I only agreed to let her stay here for a week. It's been 6 weeks. I honestly can't stand to live with her anymore. She makes a mess everywhere, has parties when me and hubby aren't home, plays music on max volume till 4 am, she's rude, breaks stuff, disrespects all my boundaries and house rules.\u00a0 Finances aren't good either with the extra expenses.\u00a0\n\n\nLast night I sat them down and told them that she needs to leave in a week because I'm done. I haven't had a real night sleep in 6 weeks, the apartment is a mess because my husband can't keep up with the mess she makes and I'm reaching rock bottom with the expensise. He asked if I would let her stay if she would get a job and I said yes. That would mean she won't have the energy to stay up till 4am and make a mess and she will also contribute financially. She ran out screaming that she isn't getting a job and I'm a bitch.\u00a0\n\n\nI called MIL and asked her again why they had a fight. She's pregnant. Baby daddy disappeared into the night when he heard the news. She expected her parents to provide and they said no so she came here. I told my husband and he was shocked but said we can't kick her out now. I said yes we can and we are. I will not be financially responsible for her anymore. I will not be financially responsible for her child. I will not have a child in my home. I strongly dislike kids. I don't need the noise, the mess, the smell, the extra expenses. Hubby said he understands that I don't want any of this but we can't kick her out because she has nowhere to go since his parents won't let her move back home.\u00a0\n\n\nI simply said either she goes or I go.\n\n\n\u00a0I'm sick of him enabling her behavior. He always makes excuses for her. He bends backwards for her. Well I'm not going to. She is an adult. She isn't in school. She doesn't work. She wants to have a baby? Ok. Then she needs to grow up and provide for herself. She isn't disabled, sick, mentally incapacitated or anything else that would stop her from working. She just doesn't want to work. Her parents spoiled too much when she was younger and now she thinks the world revolves around her.\n\n\nMy friends and my in-laws agree with me, but my parents say I'm TA for kicking out a pregnant girl and making my husband choose between me and her.\n\n\nI'm not changing my decision no matter what.

He fully intended to try and twist your arm into letting her stay permanently and taking on her and her child.

I believe in helping people but I don't  believe in enabling ungrateful entitled human beings.  SIL is not ready to be a parent. Don't make taking care of her your responsibility.
