To me, 12 is way too old to still believe. I'll burst that bubble myself if I have to around 9/10 because it gets embarrassing around that time and they are going to get made fun of.\n\nAlso it's Santa, idk why your husband feels the need to be there.

Personally I think age 10 should be the cut off age for parents to finally tell their kids. Much older and you're inviting bullying and conflicted feelings and what not. 10 is when I found a present before Xmas that was then from Santa on Christmas morning. I put 2 and 2 together. And I think in hindsight it's the perfect age. You're just old enough, but not too young to know.\n\nDad should realize he can't be there for every single moment in life. He'll have plenty more you won't be a part of likely in the next few years by the nature of the beast.

FWIW, we did Santa and adjacent things when I was little, but I don't remember an age at which I didn't know that the presents came from my parents. And that's a good thing! Magic doesn't have to involve deception. \n\nAlso, hopefully the kids have friends who are from different religions and don't celebrate Christmas, so they'll know that Santa isn't real. For me, no one who tells the truth to a kid over the age of, say, 5, is an AH except if it's done in a particularly spiteful way (which it usually isn't).\n\nBut 12? He's nearly a teen!

The best explanation I think I've heard is to confirm the presents were from the parents, but now that he knows, it's up to him to keep the spirit of giving alive for the  younger kids to keep the magic alive and team them how to keep giving alive.", "Told our kids soon as they could  understand at about 5 years old that it is all a lie.

He\u2019ll cool off and this will be blown over. \n\nI agree that situation arises and you can\u2019t control them. My mom use to say, \u201cyou can plan with kids, but those plans are more guidelines\u201d", "So how should OP have handled her kid outright asking, with a younger sibling in the house as well?\n\nNot realistic or fair to the kid to delay it and build it into a big thing when it isn't.", "lol 3\n\nDon\u2019t talk shit mate", "I don't disagree. I just hate these arbitrary \"cut offs\". Unless otherwise said or existing, it isn't hurting anyone. Now if the kid is being ridiculed then maybe. But we don't know.", "Yeah we definitely had that talk with the kid when she was loudly denouncing Santa, the Easter Bunny, etc. \"But the tooth fairy is real.\"", "Wow, clutch those pearls while I pull the fainting couch out for you.", "Sure, most people don't resent their parents/grandparents for lying to them about Christmas. Most people also don't think they always get the truth from the parents/grandparents either.\n\nThere is a reputational cost to lying to children, and I'd like my children to actually trust what I tell them because Dad never tricks them. A smart parent can make sure kids have plenty of fun without having to lie to them about fanciful things.", "> Not required\n\nWell he's \"pissed off\" or \"upset\" that he wasn't included, so I'm not sure how you conclude that he doesn't think he was required.", "You don't seem to have much faith in your children.  And be honest with yourself, because you *are* going to lie to them sometimes.  And it will be about more than fanciful things.  Hell, if you're going to lie, fanciful things are the things to lie about.  My daughter had her own personal gnome, monsters and monster repellent, Santa, and a unicorn.  Nevertheless we still manage to trust each other, and somehow each of us remembers those things with pleasure.  Edit:  Some of the lies you tell them will be to protect them.  Those are the ones that are going to f up the relationship, not the fun ones.", "For whatever reason the kid asked mom so mom had the conversation with him.\n\nShe didn\u2019t initiate the conversation. She responded appropriately in the moment.\n\nDad can be as upset as he wants but he really shouldn\u2019t be. Nothing that happened was about him or directed at him.\n\nNone of this should have been a big deal.", "> Some of the lies you tell them will be to protect them.\n\nExample?"]}
