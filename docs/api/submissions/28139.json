I know a friend with Chinese heritage needed to consult with family because certain date combinations were bad luck and they gave her 3 or 4 dates to choose from that were the best luck. Why do you want to consult family?", "Info\n\nYou haven't provided us with a reason for consulting them. There are many good reasons and many bad reasons.\n\nThe other issue is what you mean by 'consult'. Again, there are many good and bad ways to describe 'consult'.\n\n eg: \"we are thinking about having the wedding in July or August; should any specific dates be avoided & why?\" = probably good, but depends on the 'why'. \n\neg: \"we are thinking about having the wedding in July or August; which dates work best for you & why?\" = could be good or bad depending on the 'why' and your reason for asking (is it a destination wedding for either set of parents?). \n\neg: \"we are thinking about when to have the wedding; what dates do you suggest & why?\" = probably bad because each parent will make decisions based on themselves and no one else.", "Kinda YTA\n\nBest thing in this case would be both you & your fiance coming up with a date, then letting the parents know & if they have any inconvenience, if so, you all can talk over it. That way, you two can select your own wedding day. Your fiance got angry because she didn't like that you'd ask your parents to consult the date instead of doing it yourself & with her.

Or have there been other incidents? Do you truly want to just get your parents' input or is it really just your mom you're worried about accommodating? \n\nThe \"point-blank refusal\" is a bit of an AH move IMO. I'm not sure why you couldn't compromise by asking her if she had any dates in mind and then talking to your parents. Maybe she has her heart set on a spring wedding, or a winter wedding, and she wanted to know your opinion before you ask your parents?", "I\u2019ve always held that wedding planning is a good indicator of how your marriage will go. It\u2019s a lot of communication, compromise, dealing with overbearing relatives, and financial planning. If planning the wedding leads to a lot of fights, it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re not going to deal well with sharing the stress of married life, either.\n\nAnd here you are, didn\u2019t even get 24 hours without arguing and name calling over a very minor disagreement. I don\u2019t think you two should get married.", "NAH.\n\nPresumably your parents are near the top of your guest list.  If you choose a date that happens to be in the middle of their big vacation plans, you might want to adjust the date.\n\nBut that's not the problem.  Dates can be set, and then altered.  What your fiancee wanted was a sense of your timing.  Like, is it next spring, or 3 years from now? Or the kind of \"maybe someday\" where people think \"being engaged\"  is a semi-permanent status.\n\nOr maybe she was looking for \"as soon as possible\" from you.  Or she asked you so that you could ask her what SHE thought.  You literally placed your parents concern above hers.\n\nI also sense that there's more history here for her to accuse you of being a \"momma's boy\"  so quickly.  If she's had disagreements with your mother, she may be looking for you to \"stand up to them\" and pick a date.  If that's her attitude then you saying \"they already approve the relationship\" might actually be a negative. I mean, did you ask them before you asked her??", "YTA.  If you're do sure they won't have a problem with the date, why are you so set on needing their approval? What do you mean by \"consult\" anyway?", "If he proposed today I can\u2019t fathom picking a date the same day.  Enjoy announcing it and celebrating.  I\u2019m assuming OP wants to consult parents to make sure there\u2019s no big trips coming up or something if not then it\u2019s weird.", "I think it's a good idea to consult everyone it's important to you to show up. They could easily have things scheduled and paid for that aren't easily moved. Vacations, work projects, leave days available,  important appointments, previous commitments that could need worked around. If you want people from out of state it gets more complicated and stuff to work around. You could easily have family not come because you announced a date that comes at a bad time.", "NTA. Why is it a decision that needs to be made right at this moment?\n\nWhat she is suggesting is not normal. The Momma's boy comment seems as if it has been sitting in the chamber to be used.\n\nAsk her why she has a problem with including the parents in this momentous occasion, her parents are part of your plan as well. Super strange.", "Yikes. NTA. This is clearly a deep seeded issue for your GF. It is beyond obvious for anyone who is in a halfway decent relationship with their parents that efforts WILL be made to ensure the parents are there for the day you are married. It IS about the two of you, and you have an idea of a wedding that invokves your closest family members there celebratibg with you\u2026 \n\nI get what she is saying, i.e., you really shouldn\u2019t need to ask your parents for help finding a date. You can just throw a date to them and see if it works. But I assume that is sort of what you meant. It sounds like a miscommunication. Her response was out of line and childish, and a red flag. But maybe innocent and the sign of some sort of trauma related to her parents. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed my wife tends to defer to her dad quite a bit, and arrange things around her family, whereas I have an aversion to that and am very independent of my family/parents while still being respectful and making sure they are involved. Well, she was raised by a very close, tight knit mother and father, and her mom died when she was 21. I was raised as a latchkey kid, parents divorced when I was in elementary school and I grew up looking after myself mostly. I think this explains our difference in this regard, and I try to be very mindful not to disregard her experience when these things come up. Take that for what it\u2019s worth.", "NTA. It seems this is more of a cultural or traditional thing for you, so your fiancee should understand. You should've explained your reasoning behind it more thoroughly though.", "NTA\n\nAs other commenters stated there's nothing wrong with wanting your family involved in picking a date that works for them if that's what you value.  It's one thing to assume they're fine with it an another just to get their sign-off.  My parents go on vacations a lot so it's wholly possible we schedule something that wouldn't work for them because of pre-existing plans regardless of how important what we're planning is.  That's life.\n\nThat said in her defense I understand where she's coming from when she says it's 'our life.'  Me and my fiance are getting eloped and despite some light family protest (mostly from one of her sisters) we're still doing it on the date we decided because ultimately it's for us, not them.\n\nThat said I'll never understand how couples get to the point of marriage and then these arguments happen.  This seems like a real core issue for you and honestly you both should be aware of those before you're getting married.  The no-contact part to me is odd, I'm guessing she doesn't live with you in which case marriage also is a weird choice for me, but this could be a cultural thing.  I don't get marriage before living together.  Seems like a potential recipe for problems down the line.", "Wow, kinda surprised about the YTA\u2019s votes here. I know the wedding is supposed to be their day, but they are not going to celebrate alone just the two of them, there will be family and friends involved and surely that they can\u2019t ask everyone one by one about a suitable date, but they surely should discuss with both pair of the parents if they have any plan on the dates they want to choose. Is not about being a \u201cmommas boy\u201d or \u201cbeing unable to decide for yourself\u201d but it\u2019s about wanting the four of them free for the date and available to be present. \nIs not a big deal even if you two chose the date without consulting parents, but definitely you\u2019re NTA.", "So what date is the divorce?", "NTA.\n\nIf the parents are to be involved (does she want to walk down the aisle with her dad? He'd better be able to be there then) or if it's imperative they be there (emotionally, family ties, etc.), then yes, consult them. If the wedding is to be 3-4 years out, it's less important; but if they've already got commitments on the day you happen to choose, what then?\n\n\"Hey, parents, we're getting married! We're shooting for May 28, 2025. Please let us know right away if you have prior, concrete commitments that date.\"", "Info: when you are saying consult are you meaning ask permission or get input on their availability and potentially availability of other family members?\n\nIf it's just check in with their availability and asking for their input, NTA. If there is someone that you want at an event it's good to make sure they are available. Talking to my parents and in laws was helpful as they knew about important dates and events happening for our extended family so we could try to find a date that worked for us and the people who we wanted to be at our wedding.", "NTA\n\nIt makes sense that you want to make sure the people in your life can make it to your wedding. We had to work around 3 different school breaks across 2 countries and even then, it was hard for a couple of people to make it.\n\nMaybe sit down with her and work out a couple of dates and then go to the parents to see if there are any clashes? Ultimately, it should be whatever dates works for you both, but there's no harm in double checking your families can make it!", "NTA. It's super common to check in with important guests before settling on a date for something like a wedding. It's also really common not to settle on a final date until you've confirmed availability with your preferred venue too. I don't know what your fiancee is on about, but if this is how she deals with conflict you might want to put a pause on wedding planning until you two learn how to communicate better.", "NTA. \n\nSome of the comments below are wild. \n\nYou haven't even been engaged 5 minutes and you two can't agree on a very basic thing, and she is calling you names over it. \n\nOf course you would want to check with the people you want to have at your wedding (closest circle of people, like parents, maid of honor, best man), because you want them to come to the wedding!\n\nTo consult with your parents feels like a very obvious next step, and isn't an issue at all until there are conflicts, and then if/when there are, you have to make a decision. In a perfect world, you get some general dates that people can't attend (I have a wedding august 15th, your brother graduates June 1st,  otherwise, nothing I can't move). Then you find the venue you like, and you pick a free date. Done. \n\nHer demanding that no one should weigh in until the date is set is...weird. Not only do you want to consult important people, you also need to pick a venue (an assumption) and so you can't just open the calendar, pick a date, and go forth. There are a number of things to consider before settling on a date.", "YTA  I can see that you\u2019d want a date that they could attend; but are you actually letting them set the date for when you get married?

What if they had another wedding they already RSVPed to on the date? Or any other important commitment they couldn't get out of? What if they're going to be out of the country? I don't care who's getting married, if I've dropped a ton of non-refundable money on a rare treat for myself and then you decide to tell me after that's already set that I'm obligated to come to your wedding that was neither planned nor were you even engaged when I made the plans, that's not happening. Many things a year out are reschedulable, but not every potential commitment the parents might have is controlled by them. It's just courteous if you have a close relationship and you really want them to be there.", "When they\u2019re available, I expect. IME it\u2019s common for the couple to narrow things down first themselves, but if there are people whose attendance you find essential then it\u2019s respectful to ask when they\u2019re available instead of simply telling them. Whether these people are your parents or anyone else that you really want to be there.\n\nUnless OP left a lot out, it sounds like his gf/fianc\u00e9e turned date-setting into a litmus test for ignoring his parents.", "They might be contributing financially and therefore might need to know when to have the money ready.", "My husband and I set our date based on when his parents could attend.

Then after having that conversation, when your preferences are narrowed down, go to the family and check if there's conflicts within that window.", "No way is this the first time the \"momma's boy\" thing came up.
