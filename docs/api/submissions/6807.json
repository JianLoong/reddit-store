Her only fault here was trusting the wrong person unless she admitted to her mom that she knew they were drunk.", "You're right -- I thought I read it that the DD was just tipsy.", "We don't even know if she was aware that the designated driver had been drinking.", "Read what u just wrote", "Paying for your 17 year old's medical bills, yes, parents are responsible. \n\nTherapy isn't easy. You can go through 10 therapists and not find the right one. Being 17 and being put in therapy by your parents, is also not easy - therapy works best if the person in therapy wants to be there. I'd also love to know who fired the therapists, her or her mom, and why.", "They mean that this \u201cdesignated driver\u201d was intoxicated, so clearly not an actual DD.", "Although it is true that she should know better not to get into a car with an intoxicated driver, it is hard to guess what happened exactly at the actual event. Teenage relationships are hard, she might have been pushed into it, maybe she did not seem comfortable but peer pressure at that age is real. My opinion will differ in terms of:\n\nIf she called her parents about this, would they brush her off or immediately go pick her up?\n\nBecause if she does not trust her parents to remove her from the situation, she might have gone into that self-destructive route. She is already seeing therapists and getting no to little results, that says something about a non-trusting environment to me.", "I'm starting with the default that the child didn't realize the DESIGNATED DRIVER had consumed alcohol until after the car was moving.\n\nRegardless, the child is still a minor and medical bills are the parents' responsibility. And choosing the time right after a trauma to try to \"teach her a lesson\" is just the parents acting out of anger.", "Again, she is a minor and not responsible for medical bills. Medical bills are likely provided for in their child support order. There are plenty of more appropriate ways to punish an 17year old minor.", "If they can do that - then at 17 she also can be responsible tor paying a minor medical bill - might even just be the copay or ambulance. \n\nMy point is at 17 kids ate away at college paying for their own shit all the time. Just because you\u2019re a minor doesn\u2019t mean you dont have to start learning that sometimes you gotta pay for shit you don\u2019t want to.", "Very true on this. Very easy for me on the outside looking in to say this. I think OP needs to clarify some points here", "I can agree with all of that up until the point of her getting in a car where the DD is messed up himself. How can you not tell? And why would you think that\u2019s a sound decision? And the daughter didn\u2019t give push back she said, almost made it sound like she was understanding of the response by her mom to the situation. I think OP needs to provide some more clarification. But that DD being messed up thing is a sticking point for me.\n\nAnd this is the American in me preferring clarification on going to a party where drinking is ok at 17", "explain how you would teach her responsibility out of this situation? doesn't sound like a hefty sum of medical bills. how is this any different than having her pay for her own cell phone bill or car insurance?", "A minor making choices to act like an adult.", "Teaching someone with issues how to fight can be disastrous", "Lots of people are just irresponsible and think their parents should be bailing them out all their life.\n\nWhen I was 17 I had moved out (as is common where I am from, we normally move out when we are 16).    \nI had a temp job, was paying my own bills, and was going to the Norwegian equivalent of high school.\n\nI made a mistake my parents would help me, but I was very much expected to do as much of it on my own as was reasonable. The consequences are important, that's where the lesson comes from. If you isolate them from consequences you create a spoiled and entitled child incapable of taking responsibility. \n\nIf the kid had a massive legal bill that would have destroyed her life then sure, help them take care of it.\n\nBut sounds like it is something that stings but ultimately can be handled with a teenagers temp job then no, she should be paying it, it should sting, and maybe this time she'll learn.", "If the designated driver is tipsy then thats where you draw the line? Really? So if they are tipsy then it\u2019s ok? Lol how bout the whole point of designated driver means DESIGNATED DRIVER NO DRINKING AT ALL!", "The DD lied, it seems. Happens", "Agreed, this is why I ended my post with I hope there was a lot of conversation about this situation.", "Shouldn't the medical bills be paid by the person who caused the accident through their insurance?", "No shot she didn\u2019t know. If you are at a party with friends you know when they drink and can tell if they do. It isn\u2019t rocket science so don\u2019t act like it is. And legally he could just sue her friend for reimbursement once he pays her medical bills. That way he follows his legal responsibilities but still shows her the consequences of her actions by suing the one who caused it.", "Yea, I never said she didn\u2019t need to start learning about how much being an adult sucks. But she obviously didn\u2019t want to keep this private from her parents or else how would they have known to show up at the hospital?", "Because you don't **need** a cell phone or a car, those are privileges. Health care is a basic human right, at least where I live, and as a parent, it is their duty to ensure their ***minor's*** basic needs (such as health care) are met. Just because the OP is angry, frustrated, tired, disappointed, and annoyed because their 17 year old is making stupid choices, doesn't mean their absolved from their parental obligation.", "***STILL A MINOR***", "You don't know what that is, do you?", "Or it can be a super healthy way for her to work through her personal issues that are safer than drinking and partying", "If you\u2019re Norwegian, you may not be aware of how life-destroying medical bills can be in the US. This may be a huge amount of money.", "Possibly, but do you really expect a kid to know how to navigate insurance claims? That's something her *parents* need to be helping her with.", "In a case where the insurance company will extremely likely not cover it because the driver was intoxicated? I honestly doubt it.", "Yes, usually. However, hospitals often have an insurance co-pay that you need to pay then claw back from the at-fault's insurance company later. And getting insurance companies to pay out on things like this can be hard. My parents had to sue an insurance company once to pay out after an accident because they just took so gawddamn long that my parents had to pay the bills.", "Who is old enough to learn the very serious issues that come up after making a really stupid decision.", "I am aware.\n\nBut OP presented it as something that would be manageable and OP didn't say where she is from.", "Yet still a minor\u2026. \n\nAre you not getting this? U want another \u201cShes a minor\u201d comment to read?"]}
