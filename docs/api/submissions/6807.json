It\u2019s the same thing that will happen legally in less than 12 months if she continues to behave in the same way except she currently faces no financial consequences if she can\u2019t make payments because she\u2019s not the official guarantor.", ">I prefer them not do dumb shit at all. But if they must\u2026I\u2019m not going to make it harder to make a better choice.\n\n100% agreed on this one. I was raised  by a single mom, she judged and lectured a lot to the point that we (my sister, my brother, and myself) stopped listening to her for the most part. Our relationships fractured, and none of us told her anything.  I vowed to do better for my kids if I ever had any, I was blessed to have 3 girls who at this point are out of the house and onto their own lives and I'm even a grandpa now. I don't get to see them as much as I'd prefer though we talk every day, but still to this day they all know - if they need Dad for anything, all they gotta do is call. I did my best with them, and I'm proud of all 3 of them for the great women they became - I can only hope any shortcomings I had, they do better for their own kids.", "Jeez that's triggering. You're right. YTA.", "Damn, first person to make it across the grand canyon by leaping.", "Or the much more likely scenario. They were all drinking and she knew her driver had had some also. Figured everything would be all right and went along with it. That happens every single day and I know when I was young and very dumb I let drunk dds drive me home because I was dumb.", "Why? You keep saying the parent has to ensure the bill is paid. The bill was paid. Would you feel differently if she was driving and crashed into someone else's car? Would it be wrong of them to make her pay for the damage out of her wages even if they are technically responsible for her while she's a minor?", ">their senses are impaired to a point where quick decision making is not possible and thus the risk of causing an accident is increased.\n\nSo... they're too fucked up to drive?", "And I\u2019ve literally paid hundreds of these claims. Maybe a sub standard insurer with restrictive policy language would pull this shit but any standard insurer would pay this claim absent another coverage issue. \n \nSource I\u2019m an insurance professional that\u2019s worked in the industry for 10 years and am not basing my info off of google.", "And by imposing (in this case very minor) consequences on irresponsible behavior, that developing brain learns accountability.", "No. You\u2019re just ignoring what I\u2019m saying and clinging to using the same wording when the difference is clear.", "Yes because harsh punishment (making your underage child pay for a medical bill is harsh.) doesn't built ressentment at all. OP's child will surely trust their parents much more now. Good job \ud83d\udc4d", "No, you should be asking yourself why you think there *is* a difference. Seriously, if someone got in an accident and killed your loved one and then said \"I swear I wasn't fucked up, I was just intoxicated\" what would you say? Do you hear how ridiculous that sounds?"]}
