She kicked you out. Get your name off the lease and don\u2019t give her a cent.", "if you are on the lease, she really can't kick you out. You could have stayed there if you wanted. But your roommate wanted you out, so you left. Since it was your roommates idea for you to leave, why would you pay for something you are not getting? I would not have even paid any rent for those times. \n\nNTA", "How could you be kicked out if you're on the lease?  It sounds like you left voluntarily.", "I'd be calling the cops if someone stole my pet. What the hell?", "NTA. Not a dime for a roommate that evicted you illegally. If she is harassing you at work, report her to your HR department.", "INFO: are you still paying rent? Are the \u201cextra costs\u201d back payment from when you were living there, or are they owed from December onwards when you were no longer living there? Did she demand that you leave in December, or could you have stayed until next month? A lot of questions here.", "NTA, she kicked you out, didn't even give you time to make plans for it or warn you, you're still on the lease which means you should still be able to live there. She cannot complain or expect you to pay when she kicked you out. Please OP do not pay.", "NTA That\u2019s illegal eviction and she\u2019s moving someone who\u2019s not on the lease in and idk about in your state but in mine people can\u2019t just randomly move people in that aren\u2019t on the lease. I\u2019d say take this to your landlord and tell him they illegally forced you out and is trying to get you to pay for them and you won\u2019t. Then tell him you want you be taken off the lease as soon as possible", "NTA\n\nDid she give you any notice before kicking you out?  Kicking you out a few months before there was any need to, it seems.  That\u2019s unacceptable in most places.\n\nI\u2019ve never lived anywhere that euros were the standard currency, so I\u2019m not going to pretend I have any idea what she may be entitled to legally.\n\nMorally, she brought this relatively minor consequence on herself.  It sounds like you\u2019ve kept up with the rent, since you\u2019re fighting over extra costs.  That\u2019s another thing she may be legally entitled to but she\u2019s lucky she\u2019s getting after the bullshit she pulled.\n\nThat\u2019s all assuming you mean kicked out in some literal sense, and not that you mutually agreed that you would move out in December.  If that\u2019s what happened then this should have been agreed on beforehand, but not paying utilities seems pretty reasonable to me.  You\u2019re not using the power and water after all, and your family is bearing the increased costs of you living with them.", "NTA. If you're on the lease, you can still live there. Who is she to decide you can't live there? Move back in if she's going to decide that. I'm guessing her mom didn't move in as quickly as she thought she was going to, so it's costing her. Don't pay. This is the cost of her rudely kicking you out of your place and packing you out.", "NTA - You've mentioned in other replies that your roommate didn't just ask you to move out, she packed up your stuff, changed the locks, and you couldn't go back to the apartment. That's not kicking you out, that's evicting you. Even if you're on the lease, why would you pay for somewhere that you aren't able to go? Why would you pay for a share of utilities that you didn't use.  Your roommate just found out the consequences of her actions. Kick you out, lock you out of the property, and surprise, surprise, she has to pay her own way.", "NTA she effectively made you homeless and wants you to pay for the amenities/bills that you have not used because you were not there, because she kicked you out?!? No logic here.\nI'd say it's ok to pay for bills up until the point that you left, after that she's on her own as she should be responsible for the situation she's created.\nYou really do need to get your name removed from the lease/rental agreement - if she does any damage to the property, you will be liable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you're not living in the place you're on the lease for, get off the lease and don't pay for anything more related to it.  Don't worry about something as minor as \"who's the asshole?\", and start talking to the land lord and looking up your tenant rights.", "NTA, but I would ask your country's legal advice sub of there are any legal consequences you may face.", "NTA\n\nIf you are on legal documents as a legal renter of the space (affording you rules and rights, payments required, etc), she has to take legal steps to remove you. \n\nIf you have not signed any documents as a legal renter of the space (IE: she owns a house and let you pay to stay in a room under the table), then it\u2019s her right to remove you at any time. \n\nEither way, once she removed you (either legally or illegally), your portion of the bills is no longer your portion of the bills. You would be liable for your portion, prorated to the last day you had access. So for instance, if the electric bill covers the 1st-31st, but you were removed on the 12th, you would only owe for those 12 days. To figure out what specifically is owed, the full bill would be divided in half to represent both people, then divided by 31 days to get a per day rate, and multiplied by 12 to figure out how much you owe. \n\nIf the bills she is trying to force on you are for January, and not December, then you owe nothing.", "NTA. This is absurd of her to do this to you then expect you to pay for something you were deprived of. It's not legal for her to displace you from a dwelling for which you were on the lease. Seek legal council & take action against her - she's the asshole, not you!", "NTA\n\nShe kicked you out. The moment you stopped living there your financial responsibility stopped too.", "NTA\n\nShe illegally evicted you. Actually she owes you. And you should probably inform the landlord that you were not only kicked out but that a woman who's not on the lease is staying there now.", "NTA. But you need to stop being passive and contact a landlord and maybe the police. This isn't a legal eviction.", "NTA. Don\u2019t pay for anything you\u2019re denied access to. Simple as that.", "NTA. Screw the roommate. Don't pay her shit especially after her illegal eviction. Just ignore and block her ass.", "If you\u2019re an AH for not paying despite being on the lease, your roommate is a much bigger AH for kicking you out. Perhaps you should have had yourself removed from the lease, but that\u2019s to protect you. \n\nYour roommate\u2019s position is \u201cWe had an agreement to live together. I broke that agreement and kicked you out, without your consent. But that agreement still requires you to pay as though I hasn\u2019t kicked you out\u201d. That seems seriously unreasonable to me. \n\nNTA", "NTA,\n\nWhy are you even talking to a shitty person like your roommate? Block this person and go non contact with her. Also her mum can pay the difference right? Why should you pay for her mum, doesnt make sense.\n\nGo to HR if she keeps pestering you", "In EU Area? Thats highly illegal move. Go to police!", "NTA, do not pay her and if she brings it up at work file a complaint with HR over harrasment.", "NTA. But you are dumb. She can't just kick you out when you're on the lease. You need to get your name removed from the lease or you need to move back into the apartment you are legally responsible for.", "You're on the lease and she kicked you out, were you a bad house mate.", "NTA why would you pay for utilities that you didnt use?", "So...she illegally evicted you and expects you to pay for it.  NTA.  Stay firm.", "Have you informed the landlord? Your name is on the lease which means you're legally responsible for your portion of the rent.", "NTA\n\nBut you seem to be so passive in the face of quite appalling behaviour.\n\nShe illegally kicked you out, changing your locks and dumping your stuff outside. You are on the lease you could take action against.\n\nThan she dumped you ct with your mother and she wants you to pay \u00a3350 and you are wondering if you should???\n\nFirstly speak to the landlord and get yourself off the lease.\n\nSecondly make sure you have all the proff you need to show she did what you say she did.\n\nThird  tell her you will be suing for damages on your goods and for the illegal eviction.", "NTA. Please take this to your landlord. Your roommate illegally evicted you and the landlord needs to know. You need to get off the lease as soon as possible. Then just tell her you have been advised to not discuss ongoing legal matters whenever she brings up money. If she wants to play tough, ask her why she illegally re-homed your cat without your consent in front of your coworkers.", "So she evicted you while you were at work and now she wants you to pay for something she\u2019s been using since she\u2019s evicted you? I mean.. Do we even need to say? NTA. (If anything, report her.)", "NTA. She denied you access to the home you were supposed to live in. At that point I wouldn\u2019t pay for shit. I\u2019d also call the cops on stealing your car, if you can prove it was yours (e.g., microchip, receipt). Don\u2019t let her bully you because she was able to put your stuff out.", "NTA", "INFO: why did you just accept being kicked out and not try contacting your landlord or the police?", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for any expense incurred after she put you out.", "NTA. But that doesn\u2019t mean you are not obliged to do it if your name is still on the lease or if it was there at all", "Point of order, her roommate kicked her out unwillingly by changing the locks, or so she\u2019s said in the comments", "She changed the locks and put my stuff out", "Sounds like roommate relocated the pet to OPs moms place", "We are just a small team of 4 people at work, so it\u2019s hard to say anything or to just not get in her way at work", "The costs are from December to now, and she just moved my stuff out while I was at work and changed the lock out.", "Im getting taken off in March and her Mother gets put on, the landlord said I have to work it out with her.", "Right but because she is on the lease, she has legal recourse because it's an illegal eviction.  OP doesn't sound like they know their rights and her former roommate is exploiting that.", "aww, then yeah that does change things. Still would not pay any extras, or rent at all. then i would have sued the roommate.", "Yup, that\u2019s an illegal eviction in many places.  She might owe you for any damaged or lost property, or costs associated with moving.  It may not be enough to be worth the time or effort of pursuing it, but even so it might be enough to get her off your back about money you supposedly owe her.\n\nA landlord probably wouldn\u2019t be able to demand rent from you after that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple as a cotenant.", "Do not pay her a single thing. She if facing the consequences of her poor and illegal decisions.", "You may want to consider contacting the landlord and explaining the situation.   See if you can get removed from the lease, or at least on any future renewals.  This is important because while you are on the lease you are liable for any damages, even if you didn't cause them.   Some landlords will be accommodating, some not so much.   \n\nSince you got literally kicked out, you're NTA.  Your former roommate can take care of the utilities, etc.  If she doesn't like it she can sue you.   I'd simply tell her \"You kicked me out, so now the bills are your responsibility.  I'm not paying them.  Don't ask me about them again. \"  No putting it off, or talk about it later.   Just no.", "Did you mention that to your landlord ?\n\nWho paid the security deposit when you two moved in ?", "And you just accepted this?", "Tell whoever is in charge she is harassing you over personal matters that she created. And if they give you trouble expose her for ILLEGALLY kicking you out. Let\u2019s see how the office reacts when they hear she places all your stuff outside and changed the locks", "Tell her next time she speaks to you that you\u2019re starting the process to have her convicted for an illegal eviction and she can suck the cost out your balls. Stop letting this idiot walk all over you, grow a spine fgs", "Well you\u2019re definitely not TA and I would say morally you shouldn\u2019t have to pay, but as your name is still on the lease, then she might be able to insist that you do, depending on the terms of the lease. You might be best off seeking legal advice. You could just refuse to pay and she might drop it. If she disputes it legally, you might have to prove she kicked you out without notice and without removing you from the lease. It probably won\u2019t be worth it for her to get into a legal dispute, just for a couple of months of half the utility bills, so hopefully if you stick to your guns and refuse to pay, she will drop it. Really outrageous for her to demand you pay for utilities you couldn\u2019t use after she threw you out without notice. Why did she kick you out in December when she knew her mom wouldn\u2019t be moving in until now? Did you guys have a dispute?", "Get yourself off the lease. Tell your landlord immediately. If they wreck the place you are still liable for any damage etc. Tell your ex roommate that what she did was illegal and you will be pressing charges for unlawful eviction. Also let everyone at work know what's going on. Get off that lease NOW", "You\u2019re getting taken off by March AND your landlord literally just gave you the green light to not pay them hence the (work it out yourselves) you have a green light to tell her and her mom to \u201cHold these nuts as payment\u201d and never talk to them again. What are they gonna do call the cops and get themselves arrested for an illegal eviction? God honestly just threw you a curve ball and you hit a home run. Seems like it\u2019ll all work itself out if you just don\u2019t pay them and cut them out your life. I hope to see an update in the future if you can", "This !\n\nDid you call the landlord and let them know ?\n\nNTA."]}
