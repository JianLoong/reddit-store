Last December my business was SLOW, and while i did keep to my budget for them, it was especially hard with the household bills and the gifts for parents and siblings. Nonetheless, i sacrificed and went without because that's what dad's do... Right? Imagine my surprise when collectively the gift i received from the kids in return was a stick of deodorant with a fancy sticky note with writing saying  \"this is deodorant, it makes you smell good, use it often\"  my fiance thought it was hilarious, if not in poor taste and i laughed it off not expecting anything in the first place. \n\nFast forward, my birthday is in May, one child out of the three said happy birthday to me and none gave me a gift.\n\nFast forward: Her daughters birthday who just turned 19 was last week (june 6) she was one of the two that neither wished me a happy birthday or gave me a gift so i in kind, did the same Now my fianc\u00e9 is mad at me and is calling me petty and childish. \n\n(Before you judge me too harshly, we had a party for her in which i spent two days and stayed home from work to help with,  i just literally didn't say one word to her daughter the entire day or give her anything )\n\nFinally the conclusion-\n\nI err to you reddit and your wisdom, am i the asshole?

Something you, as an adult, already know (?).  \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA. It seems you\u2019ve treated them all well and provided for them, too. Meanwhile they\u2019re all (including your fianc\u00e9e) treating you rather poorly. \n\nYou sure you want to marry into this mess?", "NTA but dude you're such an asshole to yourself, she's not good for you and the kids clearly see you as an ATM. Honestly so does your fiancee. You need to be with someone who appreciates you and gives you the family you want. Dump her ass.", "NTA , they get what they give.", "NTA - If they ignore you and are rude to you, they should have no reason to expect a gift. Your wife can give them a gift, but you have no obligation to do so.", "Nta. And all of her 3 children are adults or near adults old enough to comprehend that the way they treat people matters. Only 1 seems to have a slight grasp on that. And lets clarify...These are NOT children. After 4 years of you giving and paying they are still behaving in a cold ungrateful manner because their mother has raised them with a sense of Greed and  entitlement, you owe those 3 young people nothing. Don't pay for birthday parties don't \"go in\" on joint gifts. Give the exact respect and consideration you are given.", "nta, they are not your kids, nor want to be", "NTA not sure how you\u2019re being called childish, they could have been polite but chose otherwise. For someone telling you to ignore the kids and their feelings about your relationship that changed quickly. Best of luck.", "NTA but dude I hate to tell you but you don\u2019t have a girlfriend you have a friends with benefits. \n\nThat fact that she is ok with her kids treating you that way but still expect you to spend money on her kids speaks volumes. \n\nWhy are you even with her?", "NTA.", "NTA they\u2019re old enough to know better. If they want to be petty and cold, let them. But then they need to understand their consequences have actions. Sounds like they\u2019ll soon be gone from the home anyway.", "NTA except you are one to yourself. I\u2019d walk away from this whole relationship. 1) you are not treated well & 2) clearly values don\u2019t align between you & your fiance.\n\nIDC how much you love her or anything else, there is a lack of respect going on. You\u2019re 10yrs younger & honestly, at 32, that is a huge gap to 42. Find someone closer in age (more importantly with values that align) and live a better life. You work hard & deserve it", "You're NTA, but I'm pretty sure your fiancee is.\n\nI was never my stepmom's biggest fan, but once a year, my dad would text me, \"Stepmom's birthday is next week, make sure you do something, do you need money?\". If I didn't know what to do, I'd ask if there was something specific she wanted, and he'd help guide me. I did this because I love and respect my father, and what was important to him was important to me. He's been dead for almost three years now and I still text her happy birthday, and arrange to see her when possible. I'm still not her biggest fan, but that's my dad's wife. (Eh - widow.) He always respected my choices. The least I can do is respect his.\n\nWhile your fiancee's kids clearly suck, your fiancee is doing nothing to remedy this situation, so I'm of the opinion that she is the root of the problem here. So, NTA for not getting her kids anything, but I think you should be reexamining the situation, because she should've addressed this when it started. They don't *have* to like you. But if they like her, they should be showing her that her choices matter to them.", "YTA because your lack if a spine. $300 gifts for persons who treat you like shit? Her mother laughs at their rudeness? You\u2019ve spent 1800 yearly in gifts for ungrateful brats, and their mother throws a tantrum when you decide not to do it anymore? Why are you even there? You could be building a family of your own with a better person.", "NTA. No one is obligated to care for one another given the ages, but they shouldn't be expecting anything from you at all if they are rude to you. It should not come as a surprise to them that you got them what they got you.", "NTA stop giving them things. They don't want a relationship, fine. They don't need to. But being rude and your fiancee letting them? Hard pass from me!

Just be clear and up front and not passive aggressive.", "NTA. The best gift you can give yourself is respect. From everyone but Especially from their mother. Why are you allowing this?  You can and should take a giant step back from this relationship. Grab onto your self-respect. You deserve so much better.", "NTA. GF\u2019s response is out of line. Her daughter is an adult, so not giving her a gift is quid pro quo, no question.", "NTA What is it about everyone expecting a gift for everything! I told a coworker once that I hope he has a good birthday and he told me months later how much it meant to him that I remembered his birthday. No gift or card! WTF!", "NTA. You are only 31, don't waste your 30s with this mess.", "NTA", "NTA but you deserve better.

You\u2019re not in the wrong in fact you\u2019ve been doing way too much for your fianc\u00e9 and her kids. Frankly, they all sound ungrateful. \n\nI understand wanting to keep their mom\u2019s new partner at arms length, as it\u2019s all new but at this point you\u2019ve been there long enough, you are thoughtful, you get them gifts, suggest family bonding etc.. the least they can do is be respectful and return the sentiment when due. For all you\u2019ve done it would\u2019ve cost them very little to get you something for your birthday or Christmas especially after spending $300 on them, instead they gave you a stick of deodorant with an insult on it, and expected you to laugh. This is mine boggling, that you put up with this for so long, you deserve better. Your fianc\u00e9 is also a huge AH", "Just walk away. They're rude. And your fiancee laughed when they insulted you.", "NTA. They aren't children, and you're not obligated to give them anything except what you get from them.", "NTA in this situation... But does your fiance know that you're watching and rating NAKED girls on Reddit? That's disgusting, especially in committed relationship.", "ESH - I get your intention. But rhe kids were already 18/15/13. Depending on activities, friends, jobs, homework - add in ages? Yeah. Once a week family game night seems a bit much if they\u2019re not interested.\n\nPeople have to understand that stepparents coming into lives as teenagers vs young children are going to be very different. I wouldn\u2019t expect minors to purchase gifts for their mothers boyfriend.\n\nDid you ever address with your GF that they\u2019re not at least saying hi, etc?", "NTA for the gift but you\u2019re the asshole for how you\u2019re acting toward them. You\u2019re only 10-15 years older than her kids. You\u2019re not their dad. Stop trying to be one. They and her have all been very clear they don\u2019t expect that. Stop trying to force it. It seems very obvious that they are opposed to you trying to force this. \n\n\u201covertime the family I wanted has basically broken down\u201d - stop trying to force a family with kids who don\u2019t want you to be their dad. You\u2019re not their dad or even their step dad. You\u2019re just their moms boyfriend\n\n\u201ci sacrificed and went without because that's what dad's do... Right?\u201c - you\u2019re not a dad. Just their moms boyfriend \n\nAlso what is a \u201cvery successful dating life\u201d prior to meeting her? By definition, you should have been single before meeting her. Is that your definition of \u201cvery successful\u201d in dating? Or are you trying to brag that you got laid a lot?", "Gave them some deodorant", "It seems to me that you\u2019re making this harder than it needs to be.  The 18th birthday is the last one that will be celebrated with presents from you, so the 17-year old boy gets one more.  Everyone gets a card on their birthday wishing them well.\n\nRight now, you\u2019re planning to gift the boy because he behaved in a manner that pleased you.  That\u2019s too transactional.  Gift him because it\u2019s his 18th birthday and then stop.\n\nIf you ever get on better terms with them, you could start celebrating milestone birthdays with them, but you aren\u2019t even close to that.\n\nI question why you even want to marry into this family.  Civility is a thing and it\u2019s taught by the parents.  Your fianc\u00e9e clearly didn\u2019t do her job and seems unwilling to demand that her kids treat her partner with respect.  This will not end well.\n\nNTA", "ESH. You should not be so petty. You don\u2019t have to buy the kids gifts, but you shouldn\u2019t give them the silent treatment. The kids suck for their treatment of you, even though you\u2019re not much older than them. Your girlfriend sucks for laughing at their \u201cjoke\u201d.\n\nIn your shoes, I would end the relationship. You will always come after her kids.", "YTA\n\nYou're the person their mother is with. You're only 10 years older than the oldest, and she was an 18 year old newly-minted adult, or nearly so, four years ago when you started your relationship with her mother. The other two were in their mid-teens. \n\nYou're not a stepparent.  None of your fianc\u00e9e's children are going to see you as a parental figure when you're barely older than them.  And they don't owe you \"the family you wanted.\" \n\nWhat you have are three house-mates.  Who didn't have a say in choosing you as a house mate.  If you want to have a decent relationship with them, you need to treat them as the adult house-mates that they are.\n\nGame nights and movie nights are out.  They're adults, have their own lives, not interested. You can't buy their affection with expensive gifts and cash, and you're a fool for ever having tried.  \n\nAt the same time, basic decent manners are needed for house-mates.  Giving someone the silent treatment at their birthday party doesn't fall under the category of \"decent manners.\"  \n\nGive them basic, practical gifts, e.g., if they have cars, but don't have a tire gauge or jumper cables, get one or the other.  Or modestly priced gift cards. Stay out of their celebrations, none of you are comfortable with your involvement.  Spending two days planning a party, then going and giving the silent treatment, is obnoxious, you just set up a party where you were going to sit like a lump and make it uncomfortable for all involved.", "First of all, don\u2019t marry this woman. This relationship is not ready for marriage.\n\nMultiple problems here. \n\n1) The oldest of her children is only 10 years younger than you. I don\u2019t know how any of them would take you seriously as a potential stepfather when the youngest is already old enough to graduate high school.\n\n2) $300 per kid when you first started dating? Why on earth would you ever? You don\u2019t even know those kids. You don\u2019t have a relationship where present-exchanging would be at all appropriate. Yes, none of them have bought you presents, but why did YOU buy THEM presents, much less $300 worth of presents EACH? And you started this when you were 28 years old? SMH. Maybe a stocking stuffer at Christmas or a $25 Amazon gift card would have been appropriate, if that. You need to develop relationships on their own merit before gift-giving becomes an expectation.\n\n3. You\u2019re sinking to their level when you return petty for petty. I don\u2019t necessarily blame you for not continuing a pattern where you give someone a gift and they don\u2019t reciprocate. That\u2019s not the issue. The issue is that you\u2019re treating these people that you BARELY know, who are NOT your children, who are themselves grown, in this weird state of \u201cI\u2019m your dad but also your peer\u201d. You want to treat them like a dad but then you respond like a teenager. You are neither. Stop trying to play that role.\n\nAnd then your fianc\u00e9e is a jerk for not addressing any of this. But again, who is the adult here? Any of you? I see someone has managed to get all the way to age 42 without ever managing to escape high school.\n\nAll of you need a reset. Start over. Have a conversation with each of the kids, if they\u2019re willing, about having a clean slate and developing a relationship at a pace that works for them. And if they\u2019re not willing, because this whole situation is just very immature, then so be it. Stop giving gifts and maybe dress it up as a \u201cnew tradition\u201d where you just, for example, have a Secret Santa, or take the family out to dinner once a year, or whatever. Something that doesn\u2019t cost $900 and results in a stick of deodorant.", "YTA. You act as if you are a parent to these kids- but you\u2019re not. Their mother has made that clear. While you are an adult now present in their lives, you\u2019re not an authority figure or something they\u2019re obligated to look up to. If you want the relationship to work, you have even a mild obligation to try and make a small effort. A small gift and a happy birthday would\u2019ve had the same effect without backlash. Have you considered sitting down with the kids to see where their discomfort comes from? To address that you aren\u2019t trying to replace their dad?", "Soft ESH. Tough situation.

Just weather the storm. There are consequences to being brats.", "Maybe they don't respect you because you look for hookups on Reddit?", "A few thoughts:\n\n* Your fiancestarted having 3 kids with somebody else when she was 20, then got engaged to a 32 year old when she was over 40. You are about halfway between her age and her children's age, so they probably have some feelings about you as a stepfather and authority figure. I'm not saying they're right, they sound like spoiled brats, but you put yourself in a complicated situation that sounds like it hasn't been discussed much.\n* If they still feel positively towards their absentee father, then they are probably hoping you don't marry their mom, and they still remain resistant to your forming a relationship with any of them.\n* Definitely NTA, but be careful about this tit-for-tat mindset you have. Unless you'd like to be her second divorce, fighting with her kids is fairly perlious ground, even if you are right in your position.\n\nWhat I would do in this situation is ask your fiance what her expectations were, then remind her that she told you not to worry about her kids, and that they didn't wish you a happy birthday or get you anything. Don't sink to their level and get angry; just show that you are doing what she asked.\n\nIf I were you, I would seriously rethink this relationship. You say you love her so much, etc, but if those feelings are returned where is the advocacy for you? This engagement seems like a divorce waiting to happen.\n\nIf you are utterly determined to try to make this work, I would stop trying to unite the family for shared events. They aren't doing this without you, so trying to force it on them as an outsider is not a winning strategy. Instead, try to form relationships with every member of her family individually. I wouldn't even take the daughters out at the same time. You don't need to spend $300 to get closer to somebody. If they are watching television, you could sit down to join them, **but be very careful not to talk during thier shows or express your opinion.** You get 1-2 quetions, max, but the idea is to gather information, not share it. Instead of $300 gifts, figure out what kind of food every family likes, and try to share a meal with them one-on-one occasionally, just every few weeks. \n\nOn any date, the date is probably going better the more listening you are doing, and this is the same even outside of romantic contexts. You should only do the talking if they give you a wall of silence, and then what you share with them should be positive and personal. If they give you a wall, you need them to see you as a person, and then it's OK to do more talking. If they see you as a person, you want them sharing with you.\n\nUltimately, you want every child to have a personal 1:1 relationship with you, **not as a father figure** but instead as a friend who is dating their mom. **Do not speak negatively of their father**, as this is not your role and he sounds completely absent without your help. Most times, it's enough to ask if you can help, then let them know you're available when they inevitably say no.\n\nIf you are successful, you may be able to wear them down separately, and then they will be nicer at home. This will not result in family events like you want.\n\nYour fiance has made no effort to get her kids to accept her boyfriend before getting engaged to you, though, so overall I would say this situation is high risk.", "NTA. Do you want to spend the rest of your life with a \u201cfamily\u201d that treats you like this?", "Op you\u2019re 32 with your own company.

It sounds to me like your fianc\u00e9 and/or you may have crossed some of their boundaries when defining your role in their lives. I know you say you discussed the kids and parenting, but sounds to me like you really wanted to be a good father figure and perhaps your fianc\u00e9 wanted to provide the kids with a good father figure (in light of their deadbeat dad) that you may have inadvertently pushed a family dynamic on them that they just weren\u2019t comfortable with (again\u2026 her oldest was literally an adult when you met her).\n\nWith that said, I\u2019m also not surprised that the daughters are colder towards you too\u2014when you started dating their mom, you could have technically/legally also have dated the oldest daughter.

Off the top of my head I\u2019m going with E S H but \u2026 let\u2019s see how it all looks at the end of the unboxing. \n\nThe three people you are referring to are your partner\u2019s offspring for sure, but they\u2019re not children. I don\u2019t care where they live or whether they\u2019re mooching off mom or not, they are full grown adults. Include the 17 year old in this scenario. It matters.\n\nI should HOPE the \u201cchildren\u201d aren\u2019t yours! You have a mere ten years on the oldest! Okay, with that ten year age difference you\u2019ve discussed \u201cparenting\u201d them?! Put yourself in their shoes. They are probably offended to beat all hell. And laughing at you. And silently (or not) telling you to gfys & who do you think you are. You should NOT be part of any parenting conversation. That\u2019s between their, y\u2019know, *parents.* \n\nYou are their mother\u2019s partner, or live-in, or however you define it, but at 32 years old you can\u2019t \u201cparent\u201d three young adults. That ship has sailed and is way over the horizon. It has mostly sailed for their actual parent too. The 17 year old being the obvious exception. But show me a 17 yr old who doesn\u2019t believe they\u2019re a full grown adult and, you get the picture. If they\u2019re not raised properly by now it\u2019s not her that\u2019s going to school them. It\u2019ll be life itself. \n\nYou didn\u2019t need to budget $300 for gifts! Good lord. Reading this as someone your mother\u2019s age, even I think it comes across as overbearing and infantilizing.\n\nYou gave them gifts expecting them to reciprocate? That is your own immaturity showing. That is not what gifts are about. Now you\u2019re *mad* that they haven\u2019t reciprocated? That\u2019s, well, that\u2019s not cool. And another sign of emotional immaturity at least. \n\nThe deodorant was a not-very-subtle hint. The message made it explicit. You have a body odour problem. Your gf doesn\u2019t seem to care. They do. It\u2019s not helping. Don\u2019t be offended. Address the problem. \n\nMy hunch\u2014as an actual parent of kids who are now grown adults\u2014is that these three young adults resent the crap out of you for trying to be something you\u2019re not, never will be and\u2014given that you were 10 years old when the oldest was born\u2014never could have been. Your hygiene problem is not helping them to perceive you more charitably. \n\nYou need to step way back. [I\u2019ve scrolled back up to review: your gf was right.] All you need to do is be courteous and respectful. You have a right to the same from her children. But that\u2019s ALL. They don\u2019t need \u201cparenting\u201d or gifts from you, and you sure as hell shouldn\u2019t be expecting reciprocal gifts from them no matter what. \n\nThere are 5 adults sharing a home. The relationship should be peer-to-peer. If your gf has done her job, then it will be a bit wonky but it should work. If it doesn\u2019t work, and the three younger ones are involved, then you all need to talk about it adult-to-adult. \n\nRight. Having unboxed it all, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to say YTA. Well meaning perhaps, but yeah. Sorry. Ten year olds don\u2019t (or, god help us, shouldn\u2019t) have children of their own. You\u2019ve misunderstood the nature of the relationship. The three musketeers have not.", "NTA. \n\n*IF* there is more to the story where you have done something that would have potentially caused them to have real anger or resentment, it could make sense that they are being rude, and your fianc\u00e9e being aware of something of that sort, is not enforcing basic courtesy from her children just hoping that time will heal those wounds. It would be worth asking your fianc\u00e9e if there is something you have knowingly or unknowingly done that would justify such anger and resentment. \n\nHowever, assuming you HAVE NOT done something that we, as readers, are not aware of, it is HIGHLY problematic that your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s children do not consistently show you basic courtesy and respect. \n\nI think it makes sense for them to feel the internal struggle of having a step-parent in their lives and choose to be emotionally distant from you. \n\nI also think it makes sense for you to do kind, unreciprocated things for your fianc\u00e9\u2019s children out of your love for her because they are her almost-adult-or-adult children. \n\nI think it is common for college-aged people to be very self-absorbed and thoughtless. It is a time of huge transition. Most of us are not at our best at that age.\n\nI think it makes emotional sense (albeit not effective or healthy) for the young people to act like you are the enemy as a way to form an alliance with their father because they adore him and he doesn\u2019t invest in them. So they act like you are horrible to curry favor with him. (This behavior demonstrates that therapy would be useful, but in the absence of good therapy, is common.)\n\nIMHO, children are not expected to reciprocate with their parents. Their relationships with their parents/parental figures are the place where they can be angry, difficult, contrary, and push and be loved and treated kindly anyway. Parity should not be expected with one\u2019s children, even nearly grown ones.  (I\u2019m not saying you do expect those things OP, just stating them for the nuance I\u2019m trying to convey.)\n\nAlso, IMHO, gifts are gifts. They shouldn\u2019t come with expectations for reciprocity. (Again, not saying you do expect those things OP).\n\nBUT, all that said, it is VERY problematic that your fianc\u00e9e does not insist they show you basic courtesy and respect. \n\nIt is fair to expect in one\u2019s own home to be treated with basic kindness and respect, even if not with warmth and affection. \n\nFrom what you have shared in your post, and from the limited view of your situation we readers have, I think the behavior of the young people in this situation is the SYMPTOM of your fianc\u00e9e not having boundaries with them about what sort of behavior will be tolerated toward you in her (and your) home. What they are doing it problematic. And they are old enough to know and do at least somewhat better. But it is your fianc\u00e9e that should be demanding and expecting basic respect and courtesy be shown BY her children toward other people present in the home. \n\nHer choice not to set those boundaries around those expectations reflects REAL, SIGNIFICANT issues. \n\nIf she WOULD NOT expect them to treat ANYONE with basic courtesy and respect when in your home (say a visiting elder), then it tells you something significant about her parenting and expectations about the treatment of others. \n\nIf she WOULD expect them to treat a visiting elder or one of her friends with basic courtesy and respect, but is not insisting they do the same with you, then it tells you something REALLY SIGNIFICANT about how much she values YOU. \n\nThe young people will treat you how their mother models treating you and what she demands and expects in her home. Their behavior is a symptom of HER choices and expectations, imho. \n\nAnd if you decide to stay, I very much hope you seek therapy for yourself so you have support in navigating standing up for yourself while still being kind/consistent with your own values. AND, if you decide to stay I hope that you will seek couples/family therapy where some of this can be explored and y\u2019all set basic norms for your family. \n\nIn the meantime, it might be worthwhile to get a stack of $25 gift cards to someplace like amazon or target that anyone can use. At each holiday and birthday, give them a gift card in a greeting card. It is a much smaller investment of your time and money. Then your behavior cannot be construed as mean or childish, but it also, hopefully, will feel less out of balance. With the 17yo fellow who makes a little more effort, if you find ways to connect with him - say building a flower box with his mom - you might give him a set of inexpensive vice grips or something to have for when he makes stuff when he is older. That way you are doing extra things for him out of the points of connection you\u2019ve made, but it won\u2019t be like you are triangulating/playing favorites/playing games/ being childish with birthday gifts. \n\nStill, given what we know, NTA.", "ESH.

We now have a great relationship, I love him very much, and I try to get him thoughtful gifts.\n\nI'm a bit split on this because I think OP might be doing too much. Like maybe the kids think he's trying too hard. Like he's trying to buy them over or just trying to impress their mom by trying to include them. I don't think the fiance was mad about the lack of gift. I think she was mad that it was a petty reaction, instead of being the adult that sets an example. Which seems to be accurate when he says he's gonna only buy the son a gift. So now it seems OP is way on the other side of the scale - doing too little. On purpose.\n\nIf OP really cares about them, or wants to, I say go with a classic. Treat others how you wish to be treated. If they continue to be sh***y to him, well, that says something about them. What OP does will say something about him. Find a balance. Treat them with respect.

If that's the case, the idolization won't disappear if he's not around to ruin his name. Plus, since your woman (she's not yours, you're hers) doesn't respect you, him returning to ruin his name wouldn't exactly be good for you. YOU ARE NOT THE FATHER. You are simply a provider, a provider who is not valued.*\n\n* ...and have had (depending on your definition) a very successful dating life prior to meeting her\n\n*This should serve as a clue, but it's not. Your definition of \"very successful dating life\" seems broken if a disrespectful 42yo single mom with three children who hate you is the best you can do, especially when considering...*\n\n* I own a construction company and...financially stable\n\n*Your financial success at a young age means that you're a catch, at least financially. Owning and operating a successful business with multiple employees also requires people skills, so get out of this relationship and get some therapy before those skills deteriorate as a result of this relationship, then enter the dating field. Leave her far behind. Vanish without a trace. If you made the mistake of purchasing items (like home or cars), consider them as part of the cost of freedom, and pay it gladly.*\n\n* **They idolize their dad that is basically nonexistent in their lives, however, they hate me.**\n\nYOU ARE NOT THE FATHER. YOU ARE AN OBJECT THAT EASES THEIR MOTHER'S FINANCIAL LOAD. NOTHING MORE.\n\n* **Despite this, overtime the family I wanted has basically broken down to the point where myself and her children don't interact in any fashion.**\n\n*That isn't true. The family you wanted never existed. It's not your family, no matter what you imagine or dream. Find a woman who wants to start a family, then you can build it, together, into the family you* ***both*** *always wanted.*\n\n* **Fast forward, my birthday is in May, one child out of the three said happy birthday to me and none gave me a gift.**\n\n**Fast forward: Her daughters birthday who just turned 19 was last week (june 6) she was one of the two that neither wished me a happy birthday or gave me a gift so i in kind, did the same Now my fianc\u00e9 is mad at me and is calling me petty and childish.**\n\n*You resorting to this weak and petty line of thinking stems from the pain you feel after being disrespected, for 4 years, by all 5 people here (I'm counting you since you don't respect yourself enough to either command standards or get out), so, feeling like less of a man, you're now acting like one.

At that point, it's an uphill battle for him.  Personally, I would stop trying to win an unwinnable battle and go find greener pastures.
