Instead, my fianc\u00e9 insists that as long as I treat her good, not to bother or worry about how her children view me or our relationship and to simply be nice and say hello, etc when our paths do cross, which I have done to 10,000 blank stares and no replies oncesoever.  \n\nI digress: When we first got together up until last year, i set a budget of $300 per kid for birthday and Christmas presents and for four years bought the kids nice and thought out gifts or just gave cash. Last December my business was SLOW, and while i did keep to my budget for them, it was especially hard with the household bills and the gifts for parents and siblings. Nonetheless, i sacrificed and went without because that's what dad's do... Right? Imagine my surprise when collectively the gift i received from the kids in return was a stick of deodorant with a fancy sticky note with writing saying  \"this is deodorant, it makes you smell good, use it often\"  my fiance thought it was hilarious, if not in poor taste and i laughed it off not expecting anything in the first place. \n\nFast forward, my birthday is in May, one child out of the three said happy birthday to me and none gave me a gift.\n\nFast forward: Her daughters birthday who just turned 19 was last week (june 6) she was one of the two that neither wished me a happy birthday or gave me a gift so i in kind, did the same Now my fianc\u00e9 is mad at me and is calling me petty and childish. \n\n(Before you judge me too harshly, we had a party for her in which i spent two days and stayed home from work to help with,  i just literally didn't say one word to her daughter the entire day or give her anything )\n\nFinally the conclusion-\n\nI err to you reddit and your wisdom, am i the asshole?

Something you, as an adult, already know (?).  \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA. It seems you\u2019ve treated them all well and provided for them, too. Meanwhile they\u2019re all (including your fianc\u00e9e) treating you rather poorly. \n\nYou sure you want to marry into this mess?", "NTA but dude you're such an asshole to yourself, she's not good for you and the kids clearly see you as an ATM. Honestly so does your fiancee. You need to be with someone who appreciates you and gives you the family you want. Dump her ass.", "NTA , they get what they give.", "NTA - If they ignore you and are rude to you, they should have no reason to expect a gift. Your wife can give them a gift, but you have no obligation to do so.", "Nta. And all of her 3 children are adults or near adults old enough to comprehend that the way they treat people matters. Only 1 seems to have a slight grasp on that. And lets clarify...These are NOT children. After 4 years of you giving and paying they are still behaving in a cold ungrateful manner because their mother has raised them with a sense of Greed and  entitlement, you owe those 3 young people nothing. Don't pay for birthday parties don't \"go in\" on joint gifts. Give the exact respect and consideration you are given.", "nta, they are not your kids, nor want to be", "NTA not sure how you\u2019re being called childish, they could have been polite but chose otherwise. For someone telling you to ignore the kids and their feelings about your relationship that changed quickly. Best of luck.", "NTA but dude I hate to tell you but you don\u2019t have a girlfriend you have a friends with benefits. \n\nThat fact that she is ok with her kids treating you that way but still expect you to spend money on her kids speaks volumes. \n\nWhy are you even with her?", "NTA.", "NTA they\u2019re old enough to know better. If they want to be petty and cold, let them. But then they need to understand their consequences have actions. Sounds like they\u2019ll soon be gone from the home anyway.", "NTA except you are one to yourself. I\u2019d walk away from this whole relationship. 1) you are not treated well & 2) clearly values don\u2019t align between you & your fiance.\n\nIDC how much you love her or anything else, there is a lack of respect going on. You\u2019re 10yrs younger & honestly, at 32, that is a huge gap to 42. Find someone closer in age (more importantly with values that align) and live a better life. You work hard & deserve it", "You're NTA, but I'm pretty sure your fiancee is.\n\nI was never my stepmom's biggest fan, but once a year, my dad would text me, \"Stepmom's birthday is next week, make sure you do something, do you need money?\". If I didn't know what to do, I'd ask if there was something specific she wanted, and he'd help guide me. I did this because I love and respect my father, and what was important to him was important to me. He's been dead for almost three years now and I still text her happy birthday, and arrange to see her when possible. I'm still not her biggest fan, but that's my dad's wife. (Eh - widow.) He always respected my choices. The least I can do is respect his.\n\nWhile your fiancee's kids clearly suck, your fiancee is doing nothing to remedy this situation, so I'm of the opinion that she is the root of the problem here. So, NTA for not getting her kids anything, but I think you should be reexamining the situation, because she should've addressed this when it started. They don't *have* to like you. But if they like her, they should be showing her that her choices matter to them.", "YTA because your lack if a spine. $300 gifts for persons who treat you like shit? Her mother laughs at their rudeness? You\u2019ve spent 1800 yearly in gifts for ungrateful brats, and their mother throws a tantrum when you decide not to do it anymore? Why are you even there? You could be building a family of your own with a better person.", "NTA. No one is obligated to care for one another given the ages, but they shouldn't be expecting anything from you at all if they are rude to you. It should not come as a surprise to them that you got them what they got you.", "NTA stop giving them things. They don't want a relationship, fine. They don't need to. But being rude and your fiancee letting them? Hard pass from me!

Just be clear and up front and not passive aggressive.", "NTA. The best gift you can give yourself is respect. From everyone but Especially from their mother. Why are you allowing this?  You can and should take a giant step back from this relationship. Grab onto your self-respect. You deserve so much better.", "NTA. GF\u2019s response is out of line. Her daughter is an adult, so not giving her a gift is quid pro quo, no question.", "NTA What is it about everyone expecting a gift for everything! I told a coworker once that I hope he has a good birthday and he told me months later how much it meant to him that I remembered his birthday. No gift or card! WTF!", "NTA. You are only 31, don't waste your 30s with this mess.", "NTA", "NTA but you deserve better.

You\u2019re not in the wrong in fact you\u2019ve been doing way too much for your fianc\u00e9 and her kids. Frankly, they all sound ungrateful. \n\nI understand wanting to keep their mom\u2019s new partner at arms length, as it\u2019s all new but at this point you\u2019ve been there long enough, you are thoughtful, you get them gifts, suggest family bonding etc.. the least they can do is be respectful and return the sentiment when due. For all you\u2019ve done it would\u2019ve cost them very little to get you something for your birthday or Christmas especially after spending $300 on them, instead they gave you a stick of deodorant with an insult on it, and expected you to laugh. This is mine boggling, that you put up with this for so long, you deserve better. Your fianc\u00e9 is also a huge AH", "Just walk away. They're rude. And your fiancee laughed when they insulted you.", "NTA. They aren't children, and you're not obligated to give them anything except what you get from them.", "NTA in this situation... But does your fiance know that you're watching and rating NAKED girls on Reddit? That's disgusting, especially in committed relationship.", "ESH - I get your intention. But rhe kids were already 18/15/13. Depending on activities, friends, jobs, homework - add in ages? Yeah. Once a week family game night seems a bit much if they\u2019re not interested.\n\nPeople have to understand that stepparents coming into lives as teenagers vs young children are going to be very different. I wouldn\u2019t expect minors to purchase gifts for their mothers boyfriend.\n\nDid you ever address with your GF that they\u2019re not at least saying hi, etc?", "NTA for the gift but you\u2019re the asshole for how you\u2019re acting toward them. You\u2019re only 10-15 years older than her kids. You\u2019re not their dad. Stop trying to be one. They and her have all been very clear they don\u2019t expect that. Stop trying to force it. It seems very obvious that they are opposed to you trying to force this. \n\n\u201covertime the family I wanted has basically broken down\u201d - stop trying to force a family with kids who don\u2019t want you to be their dad. You\u2019re not their dad or even their step dad. You\u2019re just their moms boyfriend\n\n\u201ci sacrificed and went without because that's what dad's do... Right?\u201c - you\u2019re not a dad. Just their moms boyfriend \n\nAlso what is a \u201cvery successful dating life\u201d prior to meeting her? By definition, you should have been single before meeting her. Is that your definition of \u201cvery successful\u201d in dating? Or are you trying to brag that you got laid a lot?", "Gave them some deodorant", "It seems to me that you\u2019re making this harder than it needs to be.  The 18th birthday is the last one that will be celebrated with presents from you, so the 17-year old boy gets one more.  Everyone gets a card on their birthday wishing them well.\n\nRight now, you\u2019re planning to gift the boy because he behaved in a manner that pleased you.  That\u2019s too transactional.  Gift him because it\u2019s his 18th birthday and then stop.\n\nIf you ever get on better terms with them, you could start celebrating milestone birthdays with them, but you aren\u2019t even close to that.\n\nI question why you even want to marry into this family.  Civility is a thing and it\u2019s taught by the parents.  Your fianc\u00e9e clearly didn\u2019t do her job and seems unwilling to demand that her kids treat her partner with respect.  This will not end well.\n\nNTA", "ESH. You should not be so petty. You don\u2019t have to buy the kids gifts, but you shouldn\u2019t give them the silent treatment. The kids suck for their treatment of you, even though you\u2019re not much older than them. Your girlfriend sucks for laughing at their \u201cjoke\u201d.\n\nIn your shoes, I would end the relationship. You will always come after her kids.", "YTA\n\nYou're the person their mother is with. You're only 10 years older than the oldest, and she was an 18 year old newly-minted adult, or nearly so, four years ago when you started your relationship with her mother. The other two were in their mid-teens. \n\nYou're not a stepparent.  None of your fianc\u00e9e's children are going to see you as a parental figure when you're barely older than them.  And they don't owe you \"the family you wanted.\" \n\nWhat you have are three house-mates.  Who didn't have a say in choosing you as a house mate.  If you want to have a decent relationship with them, you need to treat them as the adult house-mates that they are.\n\nGame nights and movie nights are out.  They're adults, have their own lives, not interested. You can't buy their affection with expensive gifts and cash, and you're a fool for ever having tried.  \n\nAt the same time, basic decent manners are needed for house-mates.  Giving someone the silent treatment at their birthday party doesn't fall under the category of \"decent manners.\"  \n\nGive them basic, practical gifts, e.g., if they have cars, but don't have a tire gauge or jumper cables, get one or the other.  Or modestly priced gift cards. Stay out of their celebrations, none of you are comfortable with your involvement.  Spending two days planning a party, then going and giving the silent treatment, is obnoxious, you just set up a party where you were going to sit like a lump and make it uncomfortable for all involved.", "First of all, don\u2019t marry this woman. This relationship is not ready for marriage.\n\nMultiple problems here. \n\n1) The oldest of her children is only 10 years younger than you. I don\u2019t know how any of them would take you seriously as a potential stepfather when the youngest is already old enough to graduate high school.\n\n2) $300 per kid when you first started dating? Why on earth would you ever? You don\u2019t even know those kids. You don\u2019t have a relationship where present-exchanging would be at all appropriate. Yes, none of them have bought you presents, but why did YOU buy THEM presents, much less $300 worth of presents EACH? And you started this when you were 28 years old? SMH. Maybe a stocking stuffer at Christmas or a $25 Amazon gift card would have been appropriate, if that. You need to develop relationships on their own merit before gift-giving becomes an expectation.\n\n3. You\u2019re sinking to their level when you return petty for petty. I don\u2019t necessarily blame you for not continuing a pattern where you give someone a gift and they don\u2019t reciprocate. That\u2019s not the issue. The issue is that you\u2019re treating these people that you BARELY know, who are NOT your children, who are themselves grown, in this weird state of \u201cI\u2019m your dad but also your peer\u201d. You want to treat them like a dad but then you respond like a teenager. You are neither. Stop trying to play that role.\n\nAnd then your fianc\u00e9e is a jerk for not addressing any of this. But again, who is the adult here? Any of you? I see someone has managed to get all the way to age 42 without ever managing to escape high school.\n\nAll of you need a reset. Start over. Have a conversation with each of the kids, if they\u2019re willing, about having a clean slate and developing a relationship at a pace that works for them. And if they\u2019re not willing, because this whole situation is just very immature, then so be it. Stop giving gifts and maybe dress it up as a \u201cnew tradition\u201d where you just, for example, have a Secret Santa, or take the family out to dinner once a year, or whatever. Something that doesn\u2019t cost $900 and results in a stick of deodorant.", "YTA. You act as if you are a parent to these kids- but you\u2019re not. Their mother has made that clear. While you are an adult now present in their lives, you\u2019re not an authority figure or something they\u2019re obligated to look up to. If you want the relationship to work, you have even a mild obligation to try and make a small effort. A small gift and a happy birthday would\u2019ve had the same effect without backlash. Have you considered sitting down with the kids to see where their discomfort comes from? To address that you aren\u2019t trying to replace their dad?", "Soft ESH. Tough situation.

You should have reciprocated with a roll of toilet paper for the little shits that they are. \"Use it often.\"", "ESH you because you\u2019re not their dad & it seems they\u2019ve made that clear so referring to yourself as \u201cdad\u201d is strange. The gf because she encourages their behavior. & the \u201ckids\u201d who at least two are adults are immature & disrespectful", "ESH. \n\nThat\u2019s really shitty of them to not even acknowledge your birthday.

You\u2019re not a new person in their lives.. at least birthday wishes would have been the decent thing to do on their part. \n\nOn the other hand, you don\u2019t get to complain about disrespectful that is then turn around, do the same thing, and get upset when they also think it\u2019s shitty. Even if they\u2019re adults, you\u2019re the parent and they\u2019re the children. I get the not giving her a gift thing, but you can (and probably should) be the bigger person and at least say happy birthday. \n\nSide note, their mom sucks for siding with them on that deodorant thing. Also, even if you wanna assume they \u201cforgot,\u201d it\u2019s not hard to send a quick text about your birthday so they can at least acknowledge it.

Your fianc\u00e9e and her kids are ungrateful assholes...please leave them.", "My mom was a step-parent to three teens who didn't want her there. Two were near  adults when my mom met my dad. It took decades for my half siblings to appreciate my mom, for her to become someone they confided in. That said, my dad would never have tolerated that kind of disrespect. Deodorant as a gift? Nope. Grounded. Forgot to wish her a happy birthday, while living in his house? Nope. OP try couples therapy, and if she won't go with you get ready to start over.", "Dip while you can. This doesn't sound like it's going to get better. And honestly the fact that you're even considering yourself the father figure of a 22yo speaks volumes about your character to me. She's only 10 years younger than you and the youngest is still not that much younger than you. \n\nSo the fact that you have tried your best for them and gotten nothing in response from GROWN kids (who should know how to respect someone), you're definitely NTA here. \n\nAnd your fiancee sucks a little bit for laughing off her adult children's poor behavior. They don't have to like you at all. But they should have common decency. I feel like you're being treated like a doormat and you're dealing with it because of love.", "NTA. The Christmas gift was cruel. Makes me wonder why you would be with a woman that thought it was funny.  It would have been better to not do anything. Her kids are all adults and do not need gifts from you, but the son who remembers would definitely get a gift. He\u2019s the best one of the group. Good luck OP, you deserve better", "NTA. You are the ATM", "ESH- why are you with a person who doesn't care if you are disrespected or not. I get wanting to act like a fatherly figure but they have shown they don't want that or appreciate your help.\n\nWhat makes this ESH though is in the future give gifts because you want to give them.

There are plenty of other fish in the sea. Your girlfriend is an AH.", "NTA- you tried, and tried well. I don\u2019t understand why they are expecting something from you the way they treat you. Sounds like kids can get away with their BS and mom won\u2019t do anything, but the second you reciprocated the energy now it\u2019s a problem. I hate saying this, but if the attitude it\u2019s not nipped in the butt it\u2019s only going to get worse due to the mothers enabling behavior. I think you deserve better.", "NTA. Your gf's children are old enough to understand the concept of reciprocation. You've been in their lives for four years, you do not owe them birthday gifts.", "NTA but movie night, games night? Are you 80 years old trapped in a 32yo body?\n\nEven for me and I'm older than you, that was an old/corny concept.", "Eh\u2026 more this family dynamic sounds freaking weird. \n\n\nNTA for the birthday but you have an unrealistic  expectation for expecting to play a father role. The youngest is 13 and it is really unrealistic to bond in that way. This is especially true for the 22 who would have been 18. \n\n\nI think you\u2019ve tried too hard though.

But it's less stressful when you have 2 incomes, compared to one.\n\nShe is right that you can't force a relationship with her kids, but then she's angry when you do that. \n\nIf the kids were younger, I'd say you were being petty especially if it was early on in the relationship. But you've been together for 4 years. They're never going to see you as a parent, which is ok.

With your partner's 22 year old adult child?  Really?\n\nAnd they expect/anticipate gifts because he's taught them to expect them, through his attempts to buy their affection with $300 birthday presents, and gifts of cash.   It's up to him to change the pattern he created without increasing the awkwardness of the situation.", "OP should consider going back into the dating pool.", "The fiancee basically told him to keep providing and stay quiet.

He's young enough to be an older sibling! I think it's icky and patronising he's ever seen himself as 'dad', as per the post, my youngest sister is thirteen years younger than me.

With your partner's 22 year old adult child? Really?\n\nNormal adults in healthy family dynamics don't actually mind this you know. He wasn't enforcing it. He just wanted to connect.
