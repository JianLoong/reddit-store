Next time your child goes to stay with mom have them leave it there.  Another option is to mail it to her with a note saying you dont want the responsibility in case it gets broken and would be best if used when the child is with her only.  Lol, imagine if she is tracking you and sees the watch going through the delivery process.", "NTA. \n\nThough give it back to your ex rather than throw it away. \n\nIn theory, I guess he can wear it while he's with her, but make it clear that he's not to wear it back to your house. \n\nMaybe there's some sort of kid-safe tablet or camera you can buy your son to allow him to take pictures and video? That way he still gets the fun features he likes without worries of your ex tracking your movements.", "I'm gonna say NTA\n\nI would say that you aren't comfortable with the child you have full custody over having a gps tracking device they can monitor. Return it to them and say if they like they can wear it with them.", "NTA\n\nEspecially if he doesn\u2019t even have a phone yet. A 6 year old is probably going to be rough with such an expensive watch anyhow. She\u2019s definitely trying to track you with the GPS", "Info - can the GPS in the watch be turned off?", "NTA but you need to find something to replace it with for him\n\nFactory resetting it seems like a great idea but you'd have to reset it every time he comes back from seeing her\n\nI'd either insist on having access to the account that set it up so you can change the settings/see what she is seeing or get a duplicate one for him that you control\n\nBig red flags from her, surely this counts as stalking or harassment, or could she be data gathering to use against you? If you have any kind of legal/court orders in place I'd be checking to see what this violates.", "NTA. Watch comes off before he leaves his mother\u2019s care and goes back on only when in her care. If he is sad about this, buy him a smart watch to use specifically at your house. The mother can\u2019t argue this.", "NTA. \n\nGPS is passive (the watch reads data from the radars & nothing is sent from the phone) BUT the watch could then store or send that data to a server or to someone. \n\nSo you can set it up to have full control over the watch (account, password, etc) that the Mom can't access.\n\nA factory reset + your codes would work.", "NTA but send it back to the mom. If you trash it, you\u2019ve opened yourself up to legal liability.", "NTA, but to me, the GPS is the least problem. It's just way too techy for a child that young. He needs to be immersed in the real world around him", "NTA \n\nGive it back to her or put it in a safe and only let your son wear it when he is with her. \nOr just lose the charger.", "What does your son say?  You've just taken away a gift/toy from his mother.  Does he show any semblance of understanding about your objections to this gift?", "Little kids break and lose things all the time.  If this watch ends up not working for whatever reason, oh well.  He\u2019s too young for it anyway.  NTA.", "NTA. Get rid of it and tell your ex he lost it.", "NTA but I wouldn't say anything to her about it. Just buy a duplicate one for your child to wear when he is with you. Put hers back on him when he goes back to her.", "How about \"accidentally\" getting the watch wet, when your son is in the bath. That solves the problem. After that you can conveniently \"forget\" to give him the watch till he's going to his Mom's house.", "If she feels more relaxed knowing that the child has a smart watch at school or outside for safety reasons, is it possible that you buy one smart watch which only you will control when the child is with you? She can use her when the child is with her. Of course, if her tracking your GPS is the reason you disagree with her idea.", "YTA. Until this becomes an active problem, I don't see the harm in it.

Is it one that has cellphone data?", "NTA and before you do anything to the watch or talk to the ex, consult your lawyer.  \n\nTechnically,  it's her watch since she bought it. Tampering with it might give her some legal claim against you. \n\nIt's probably a way for her to track you via your son based on her control issues in the past.  God forbid you take your child to a friend's home and she shows up to cause problems.  \n\nHaving your custody agreement modified to either remove the watch completely or having a joint account or having it in writing that you will only allow the GPS to be turned on in instances where you take your child out of state on a vacation, etc.", "NTA. I would olny let him use it at home. If it never leaves your house there is nothing to track. Explain to your son that you don't want it to be lost or stolen do it's better to keep it at home.", "NTA.  And there's an easy win-win fix.  Just turn off the GPS/location services functionality or set up security so only you can access it via Find my Phone (or whatever location app it uses.)  Have him add a password so she can't re-enable it.", "NTA\n\nI've probably been on reddit too long, but if she's that controlling, I would also consider that she's syncing the watch and looking at the photos. Perhaps looking for reasons to make you look bad and try to get more custody. My 5 year old daughter has a cute camera her grandparents got her. She loves it, no malicious intentions by the grandparents, but I am very aware of the sd card storing the pics and make sure she isn't taking pictures of us in the shower or something.\n\nIf you can afford it I think getting a version in a different color for Daddys house would be good idea since your kid loves it.", "Send it through several remailing services so it goes all around the country.", "I am not the owner of the account so I'll say it's mixed. May be able to on the watch itself.", "Tbh, I haven't really taken it yet, I just found out about the watch yesterday and I'm trying to sort through my feelings. It seems like the best answer I've seen is to tell her I don't want to be responsible for the device and he should leave it with her. He's visiting her for another day, I don't want to take it from him because I know he more than likely loves it and I don't believe he would understand or comprehend why I don't want him to have it.", "Don't do that. The child will be blamed.", "The only issue there is if the smart watch in question is water resistant or proof. I know mine is able to be worn while swimming.", "It's probably water resistant.  A lot of devices are nowadays.", "So you just throw inflammatory topics out that have no logical relation to this? How exactly does having GPS help a kid in an active shooter situation?", "there you go, lol.  give friends you have around the country/world a heads up and mail it to them with return postage.  I would have a blast with this.", "Or get him a duplicate watch and switch them out when your son is in the bath or something.", "There should be a way to turn it off on the watch itself unless the watch was specifically built for tracking (like AngelSense). I was itially going to say Y T A because I don't think it's a bad idea to be able to track your kids at that age. They aren't autonomous and wouldn't be doing anything you shouldn't know about already but if you ever really needed it (god forbid) it could end up saving them.\n\nHowever, given your ex's background, this watch sounds like it'll do more harm than good. If it's feeding her paranoia and putting you or your son at risk by worsening her delusions and behaviors then it's probably not worth having him wear it. But check to make sure you can't turn off the tracking every time you see him before you take it away (or replace it). NTA", "If your kid likes taking pictures and videos, why not get them a camera?", "Agreed; asking her to keep it at her place seems like the best solution.\n\nYou may want to submit this to a parenting subreddit since, IMO, it's more of a parenting issue than an ethical one.", "Yeah, I wonder how helpful a GPS could possibly be for a parent trying to locate a kid...", "NTA\n\nLet me just say that your level of reaction is about you and your ex. Plenty of people let their kids have watch-like devices that can call one or two preapproved phone numbers and have gps. They\u2019re not monsters! \n\nThat being said if it has a lot of functionality then it\u2019s probably not age appropriate. \n\nIf your ex has a history of tracking you then I can see this as a dick move on her part. Your house, your rules. \n\nShit happens. With Americans mass shootings and stuff it\u2019s not the worst idea ever, so while I agree with your instincts about your wife are right, let\u2019s not paint gps with a broad brush bc it triggers you.", "NTA, and I'm in no place to give you parental advice but please don't give the kid a phone at 10, there are too many ipad kids in the world and peoples intelligence is diminishing", "NTA, but he'll probably want a replacement. You can find reasonably priced, character-themed ones at Walmart. He may even like it better. Then you can tell his mom, \"Sorry, he just prefers wearing this one!\"", "NTA. Can you turn off location sharing on the device?", "She doesn't have custody.  I would allow a tracking device on the child.  My fear would be a kidnapping. \n\nNTA", "This is a sad situation I don't have good advice for, but the one thing I would definitely do for my own sake, even though it would make me very uncomfortable, is ask your child's mother why she got him that. I would do it via text so the answer was in writing. You need and deserve to understand what her line of thinking is and to protect yourself while you have your child. Also, it may be something a court needs to know about eventually. Living with a mentally ill mother doesn't do a child any good.", "NTA. I honestly would just let the kid have it for now. Within a week or two it will be broken or lost anyhow. Or the charger can get \u201clost\u201d.", "INFO: have you spoken with ex about why she gave it to him? Has she provided you with access to the device, so if he is at field trip or something similar you can both check in? Did she buy it because it will be a good tool as he is getting older? Is there a different device option that you both could agree on that would make everyone feel safe? If you have court ordered custody arrangements, are you even allowed to take a gift provided by the other parent?\n\nSeems like this made you feel triggered and took you emotionally back to a place that wasn\u2019t good from when you were together, and that\u2019s definitely not your fault. I think maybe there just needs to be some additional communication between everyone before you decide what is best. Hope you get everything figured out and it everyone is satisfied with the outcome", "NTA. This. OP, give the phone back to the mom and tell her he can only use it at her house. Tell your son that you won't allow phones and things like that for several more years. BUT you can always think about getting him one of those kids' watches, that DON'T connect to anything, that take pictures, film movies, and have educational games on them. He might not even miss her watch.", " Children misplace their stuff on the daily. Just ask them to find their shoes or a favorite toy. They are usually clueless. I know this because I have three kids.", "that or it needs to be connected to OP's device. normally i'd be 'the parent who bought the device controls the device.' but this is a kid who is way too young for this kind of technology and is likely going to take photos and videos that need to be regularly reviewed and deleted. \n\nthe whole thing seems like a safety/security concern with a kid so young."]}
