I always try to have something fun planned for the weekend so that she actually enjoys her time with me. But her being a teenager (14) makes things a bit more difficult as I can't just take her to the playground as I used to. I remember when I was a teen and the last thing I wanted to do was to do fun stuff with my parents so I always try to plan things that are a bit more \"grown up\" like going to dinner at a fancy restaurant, going off roading in ATVs, teaching her to drive (obviously not on public roads) etc. Last weekend I took my daughter clothes shopping and I basically told her she could pick whatever she wants and I'll just pay for it (obviously within reason). My girlfriend decided to come with us. Me and my girlfriend don't live together yet but she met my daughter and my daughter seems to approve of her so that's why I agreed for her to come with us. \nWhile we were at the shop my girlfriend found a dress she really liked and she did look amazing in it but when I saw the price I told her that it was a bit too expensive so she just ended up buying a few smaller things. But when it came time to pay for my daughters shopping and my girlfriend saw how much I paid for it she made this kind of angry face and she was upset with me for the rest of the afternoon. At the time I didn't know why but I didn't want to bring it up Infront of my daughter. But when we got home my girlfriend told me that I acted unfairly towards her. She was angry with me because I told her that her dress was too expensive but I ended up paying a lot more for my daughters clothes. So I told her that I'll always spend more money on my daughter than her. Which just made her even more upset. We ended up arguing and she left. It's been almost a week and she's been mad at me this whole time. And whenever we talk she always brings it up. And I'm honestly just starting to question if maybe I was an asshole?

I'm going to try and take the perspective of your girlfriend here as not a gold digger.\n\nYour girlfriend probably sees that you treat your daughter extra special every time you see her. You plan fancy dinners, trips outdoors, and real bonding experiences. I imagine you see your girlfriend a lot when your daughter isn't around between visits but because you see her more often, the bonding experience feels less special or impactful as what she may imagine your time with your daughter is like.

Shopping was the activity and she might have had an expectation of what that ment. \n\nYou might want to be careful in the future of what you invite her along to. It kinda sounds like she\u2019s temporary and not someone that you would want to invest in. Also by not buying the dress it might have seemed like you were saying she wasn\u2019t worth that.

You shouldn't compare them that way. Setting it up where both are there and you plan to pay for both their clothes, and then telling gf it's too expensive while paying more for daughter...

I would expect that and be honestly alarmed if a guy I dated didn't think that way.

There is no reason he cant have a more low key restaurant with his child and leave the 'fancy' ones for your adult partner.  That's just normal dating behavior, whether you have kids or not.  He is setting up a very unhealthy competition here and it will come back to bite him.", "And imagine if a man carries that attitude to marriage, yikes.  Can you imagine a man telling his wife his children will always get treated 'larger' in comparison to you?  I get it she's the gf right now, but he's been clear, she should heed that warning.  If you are spend more on activities/dates on your daughter then your adult spouse, something is wrong in that picture.  You are elevating the child to an adult status position.", "THIS, the way he worded it tells me he is setting up this competition, and not that he's 'being a good dad'.  GF needs to bounce and find a guy with no previous baggage, obligations or children and financial commitments, and get her own nuclear family, she will be MUCH happier. \n\nOlder divorced with kids type men prey on younger girls like this a lot, they also set up unhealthy competitions between the 'girls in his life' and sits back, claims innocence, scapegoats the new evil stepmom and enjoys the ego boost it creates.

That's a wolf.", "Or he could date someone his age, where there is no power-imbalance dynamic at play, and then it likely wouldn't be an issue.", "Yes.

He shouldn\u2019t feel it necessary to buy his girlfriend a damn thing.", "His girlfriend is much younger?", "What you fail to see, is that the MEN set up this dynamic, they woman react to it, get labeled as the bad one....MEN need to put a stop to it by NOT turning their daughters into mini-wives by disney parenting.  Treating their children as children is best, and eliminates the competition.  Simple really, but takes more effort and emphasizes not parenting from guilt.", "My kids' dad bought them special toys every weekend because he wanted to show love with material things. I couldn't afford to but I showed up. Showed up to every school event, volunteered for events, coached sports (even ones I knew nothing about), every concert, took them on adventures, etc. My ex.*could* have been a great dad if he'd done more than just buy toys and stuff. But he stopped short. We don't know if OP does anything else besides what he said in his post so we can't judge that he isn't a great dad. And the gf part, he didn't know she was going to act like that and didn't throw gf at the daughter right away or force her on the daughter.", "You talk like you know the entire backstory of how they ended up with only biweekly access to their kid?

If his gf just started having these problems, then how could he have known she has these issues?

We didn\u2019t see each other that often (maybe a few times per month); going skiing, meeting up at my grandmas place, playing games, etc. \nBut I was still living with my mom the whole time. \nAnd I would actually say I saw sth simillar with my parents. There was no more fighting just nice coparrenting. They actually seemed to like each other more then while still beeing married", "Ok but why was custody like that?

No need to assume the worst.", "Why do you assume that would be easy? Clearly the custody shook out the way it did for a reason, the courts don't just decide these things arbitrarily. Maybe he's already fought and lost the battle for more time with her. Maybe both parents recognize that it's better and more stable for the child this way. Maybe the daughter doesn't want to have to move house back and forth all the time. Maybe there's 5 million other reasons that they have things set up this way. \n\nShitting on this dad purely because he has less custody is gross. Nothing in the post suggests anyone has a problem with the custody agreement. There's not even evidence that he's a shitty dad in anyway. It's weird that people are demonizing him for giving his daughter nice things and having fun experiences with her. What else is he suppose to do during his time with her?

Probably, so this post would never exist if there wasn\u2019t an age gap. If they were both in their 20s, a 14 year old daughter is incredibly unlikely. \n\nIt seems like OP got himself a sugar baby but didn\u2019t realise it.

Not every weekend has to be a fun filled money spend frenzy!  It is ok to have no plans, and for a teenage to help with a simple chore with their dad (bonding time), grocery shopping, cooking a dinner together, building a garden, going to a volunteer activity, visiting friends w/other teens, watching a Netflix together, or simply dad doing his thing and teen is facetiming her friends in her room, or doing a school project or homework that weekend, so then mom can take a break of doing homework for a couple days out of her 'dull' weeks. It's ok for teens to be bored at dads house, even if he has her every other weekend.   \n\nThis is how we did our weekends when my SD would visit, and I had my sons, maybe once a month or so, depending on finances,  they would do something special, or we would all do something like camping or an amusement park in the summer, etc...but most weekends were 'normal'.  If she did chores for an hour, we paid her an allowance and she'd use it for icecream later in the day for example.  \n\nWe were tight with finances, but even if we weren't , it was important we weren't presenting as disney parents.  My ex was always broke, and rarely even saw our bios EOW, but when he did, it was also doing something 'fun'- he would say he couldn't bring them over because he didn't have money to take them out...I was like then don't, just spend time chatting with them, go to a park and play basketball, go for a bike ride...there are so many ways to spend time with teens and make it count.  Disney dad is a lazy cop out, sorry.\n\nAnd nah, fancy restaurants at 14 is completely unnecessary,  fancy restaurants are for couples or special occassions with your children, in an intact/nuclear home, dads aren't taking their kids every other weekend to fancy restaurants.  Guilty Disney dads often cross over into this 'mini-adult/wife' set up, and start treating their daughters as an adult mini-wife.   It absolutely sets up any future partner to fail and it's an unfair emotional burden on their daughter. He even says he's choosing 'more adult' activities, she is 14, she is not his date, treat her like a 14yr old.  Let her have her friends over for a sleepover, or bring her friends along, it doesn't have to be 24/7 her and dad on special extravagant dates ffs.   These are unhealthy and toxic parenting behaviors, it's not normal and it will damage your children and will also cause huge rifts it any relationship.", "Where did I say it would be easy?", "my mistake", "My point, he says she is 23 and he's 30?  At that point in life, it's a pretty big gap in maturity and life experience.  It's also IMO very unfair to burden a 23yr old with an ex, children, past responsibilities when they should be barely entering a stage of life to have fun with friends, date, establish their careers before settling down with someone who has no competing priors.   A guy that wouldn't scoff at buying a dress when out shopping and assure her she is always the lowest priority.  Girls need to wise up to these guys, and find their own single guy that wants to make them TOP priority with the fancy gifts/dates being with them and eachother, and all of their time.   \n\nIt's absolutely normal a young 23 yr old will want to be her so's main/top priority, but these guys also somehow really do now how to rope them in, because there is an age/maturity imbalance, so they often get manipulated and love-bombed and pressured in odd ways to date them, just so they can poop on them for not accepting being 2-3-4th place behind their original families, and then the rest of society poops on them for 'dating a guy with kids' and they are selfish, jealous and crazy.  Yuck.\n\nIt should be a PSA to young girls under age 25, all through HS and college, to never ever date guys like this, much older than them and with prior families.", "THISSSS!!!!", "I don\u2019t think this is the only reason for a girl to date a guy that much older. \n\nI think the real problem is that it would not be common for a 30 year old and 23 year old to be equal in maturity levels, but this 23 year old sounds particularly immature which makes it a bigger problem. Her behavior sounds EXTRA childish. Like a teenager", "I thought it was every other weekend, so 'horn in' on one shopping trip afternoon to spend time as a 'unit' is not intrusive.  Most blended families do most things together on those weekends, and maybe once a month the parents do something one on one.  Weekends are often the only time a couple has together also, so including the child isn't unusual.\n\nI am wise and experienced enough to know that 95pct of the time, the dads set up the dynamic of competition as they enjoy the 'power play' and women fighting over them, they then sit back and get to scapegoat the gf or stepmom as the bad one/jealous and irrational.  I've seen this play, and he seemed to set that up exactly as he wanted.  \n\nMy point exactly -your husband took you to shop for years at a clothing store and to dinner, and it was act of caring, and the gf sees him doing this for his daughter, but not a one-off on her?   A man can chew/eat gum at the same time.  He doesn't have to 'leave behind' his partner to focus on his child every other weekend he CAN include both as well as have time alone with his child.", "OP is 30, his says so right under where he said she's 23. Let's", "Agreed. It wouldn't surprise me if at 23 I \\*thought\\* I was mature enough for something like that but in hindsight, nope, nope, nope.\n\nWhich explains so much of this post. GF is treating him like daddy because he's...probably almost old enough to have fathered her. She's pissy when  he doesn't because...she's immature. And he's going along with all of this becuase he knows no woman his own age will put up with his crap.", "I never said disney parenting wasn't harmful and I completely empathize with your viewpoint and understand how disney-parenting can and does have a negative impact on children. \n\nBut I really don't think that's what's going on for OP. It doesn't sound like he's dropping buckets of money and tons of fancy experiences on her every time she's over. He said he's always tried to plan fun things to do with her but since she's older he can't just take her to the park anymore and is therefore trying to find more mature (he never said 'more adult' btw he said 'more \"grown up\"' which makes sense and doesn't seem suspicious to me at all) activities that work for her current age. So it seems like when she was younger he did exactly what you say should be done a majority of the time, hung out with her at the park and did activities like that. \n\nBut he recognizes that now his daughter is getting older and doesn't want to do those things anymore so he's trying out some new options and none of them seem out of this world extravagant to me. Yes he said they'll do fancy dinners, but he never said it was an every time thing, just that it was an example of one of the new activities he is doing with his daughter. We also don't know what level of \"Fancy\" he means when he says fancy dinners, maybe he just means they go to a local place that's a step above a Chillis or something, but even if it was super luxury places he'd take her to who cares. Your idea that fancy places are only for couples or special occasions seems like a boring way to live life. If someone can afford to go eat there and wants to then why shouldn't they? My parents would do random fancy dinners with us when we could.\n\n He also said he took her off-roading and started teaching her to drive a his other examples, which are both things I did with my dad and don't at all seem like some wild luxury. You could argue he potentially steps into disney dad territory with the shopping trip but like, that was also something my parents have done for me growing up so it feels weird to fault him for it, especially if it was just a one off trip. If he was letting her go on free-range shopping trips every time she was there you could have an argument, but as it stands I don't think he deserves to be called a disney-dad and receive all this vitriol simply for trying to make the most of the time he gets with her and trying to make sure she enjoys her time too.", "Oh, wow.

Kids don't make decisions on adult parents dating lives, of course barring abusive behavior, parents can decide to date who they want, even if the child objects/doesn't care for them.  As long as there is mutual respect/civility, kids don't decide who their parents date.  Based on everything else I read, if you want to create this dynamic with your daughter (which is harmful)- then please don't date anyone seriously until your daughter is grown and has her own life/in  college so you can dedicate your time/attention properly to someone your own age.  \n\nAnd please stop dating much younger women for your own selfish reasons, it's not right, they deserve for the world to be their oyster at this point of their lives, not a entering middle age man with a thousand competing priorities.

They deserve that, in fact I guarantee you he would want that for his daughter and would be immediately annoyed if she starts hooking up with some older man with an ex and a kid, with financial responsibilities.  He would want better for her, I'm sure of that...but it's ok for THEM to take advantage of younger girls maturity levels.

As a current 30 year old, I would personally never wanna date a 23 year old guy right now. Even if he was an early bloomer it would feel icky to me. \n\nHowever, on a separate note, I feel like I wasn\u2019t 23 THAT long ago. I was a law student. I was paying my own bills. I did live a less responsible lifestyle and I was allowed to because I have no kids. But I would never have dated some one with a kid and expected that I should be prioritized above that kid and I can\u2019t imagine my peers at that time feeling that way either. I would also not feel like it\u2019s appropriate to wine about my boyfriend not paying for a dress I wanted. It feels immature and entitled. \n\nFor example, what if it was a 23 year old who was a single mother with a 3 year old kid and some level of financial capabilities to provide for that kid? I\u2019ve known a lot of people that became mothers at that age and also earned more than I did at 23. I can\u2019t imagine them whining about not being spoiled with expensive clothes or trying to compare that against spending for a kid. I think it depends on the 23 year old a little bit. \n\nThe thing that makes the age gap feel icky to me in this case is that her behavior sounds very young and inexperienced compared to OP\u2019s level of experience."]}
