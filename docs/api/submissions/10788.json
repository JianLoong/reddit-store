I always try to have something fun planned for the weekend so that she actually enjoys her time with me. But her being a teenager (14) makes things a bit more difficult as I can't just take her to the playground as I used to. I remember when I was a teen and the last thing I wanted to do was to do fun stuff with my parents so I always try to plan things that are a bit more \"grown up\" like going to dinner at a fancy restaurant, going off roading in ATVs, teaching her to drive (obviously not on public roads) etc. Last weekend I took my daughter clothes shopping and I basically told her she could pick whatever she wants and I'll just pay for it (obviously within reason). My girlfriend decided to come with us. Me and my girlfriend don't live together yet but she met my daughter and my daughter seems to approve of her so that's why I agreed for her to come with us. \nWhile we were at the shop my girlfriend found a dress she really liked and she did look amazing in it but when I saw the price I told her that it was a bit too expensive so she just ended up buying a few smaller things. But when it came time to pay for my daughters shopping and my girlfriend saw how much I paid for it she made this kind of angry face and she was upset with me for the rest of the afternoon. At the time I didn't know why but I didn't want to bring it up Infront of my daughter. But when we got home my girlfriend told me that I acted unfairly towards her. She was angry with me because I told her that her dress was too expensive but I ended up paying a lot more for my daughters clothes. So I told her that I'll always spend more money on my daughter than her. Which just made her even more upset. We ended up arguing and she left. It's been almost a week and she's been mad at me this whole time. And whenever we talk she always brings it up. And I'm honestly just starting to question if maybe I was an asshole?

It sounds like your girlfriend is immature and jealous of your daughter. Red flag \ud83d\udea9", "NTA. Does your GF have a job? She should buy her own clothes. Let me guess, she doesn't buy clothes for YOU, does she?  Sounds like your GF is jealous of the time/money/attention/love you are (rightly) spending on your child.", "NTA your daughter is 14 and you are making memories with her. Not to mention, she is literally your responsibility. Your girlfriend is a grown woman. She should act like it.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is acting way too entitled. Props to your for putting your daughter first. She should pay for the dress on her own, and expecting you to pay for it is silly.", "NTA... Are you her sugar daddy or something?! Isn't your gf a grown woman with a job and money to buy whatever she wants when she wants? So why did she espect you to buy something expensive that she wanted out of nowhere?

I'm going to try and take the perspective of your girlfriend here as not a gold digger.\n\nYour girlfriend probably sees that you treat your daughter extra special every time you see her. You plan fancy dinners, trips outdoors, and real bonding experiences. I imagine you see your girlfriend a lot when your daughter isn't around between visits but because you see her more often, the bonding experience feels less special or impactful as what she may imagine your time with your daughter is like. This is probably a case of her feeling insecure and something you might have to reassure her on. She just wants to feel special too and understands that your daughter is special to you", "NTA, my boyfriend and I have been together for years, and I still don't expect him to buy my things. I, too, also spend more money on his daughter than he spends on me. I also spend more money on my son than I do him.\n\nNot everything is about her, she will either get over it or she won't. But, she does need to learn how to put on her big girl panties, and learn not everything is about her.", "NTA\n\nI think it's a bit weird to just go shopping with someone as an adult and just expect then to pick up the tab.

Your GF was so kind as to give you a glimpse into your future with her if you stay together. It will always be her vs your daughter.

If she wanted the dress she could have bought it, or even asked if you'd go halves on it with her or some other compromise.

As this is from your side I definitely see your point, however did you tell the girlfriend that she could join you or did you invite her shopping? I think the wording of how you discussed her joining is important. Like you we\u2019re going ice skating but only payed for your daughters skates but not your date? Shopping was the activity and she might have had an expectation of what that ment. \n\nYou might want to be careful in the future of what you invite her along to. It kinda sounds like she\u2019s temporary and not someone that you would want to invest in. Also by not buying the dress it might have seemed like you were saying she wasn\u2019t worth that.

Again, not knowing her side of this it\u2019s all an assumption but might help to see the situation differently. \n\nSo NTA but in the future you might want to be more clear about the situation.", "YTA. You shouldn't compare them that way. Setting it up where both are there and you plan to pay for both their clothes, and then telling gf it's too expensive while paying more for daughter... That's reasonable in the sense that gf should pay for her own clothes, but still, you agreed to pay for gf and doing it this way is an excellent way to make gf feel like she's not at all a priority or appreciated.\n\nTo be clear; of course your daughter should always be priority number one. I would expect that and be honestly alarmed if a guy I dated didn't think that way. However I would also be pissed if the guy rubbed it in my face.\n\nIt's one thing that that's natural, it's a whole other thing to tell that to people's face while treating them differently.
