I always try to have something fun planned for the weekend so that she actually enjoys her time with me. But her being a teenager (14) makes things a bit more difficult as I can't just take her to the playground as I used to. I remember when I was a teen and the last thing I wanted to do was to do fun stuff with my parents so I always try to plan things that are a bit more \"grown up\" like going to dinner at a fancy restaurant, going off roading in ATVs, teaching her to drive (obviously not on public roads) etc. Last weekend I took my daughter clothes shopping and I basically told her she could pick whatever she wants and I'll just pay for it (obviously within reason). My girlfriend decided to come with us. Me and my girlfriend don't live together yet but she met my daughter and my daughter seems to approve of her so that's why I agreed for her to come with us. \nWhile we were at the shop my girlfriend found a dress she really liked and she did look amazing in it but when I saw the price I told her that it was a bit too expensive so she just ended up buying a few smaller things. But when it came time to pay for my daughters shopping and my girlfriend saw how much I paid for it she made this kind of angry face and she was upset with me for the rest of the afternoon. At the time I didn't know why but I didn't want to bring it up Infront of my daughter. But when we got home my girlfriend told me that I acted unfairly towards her. She was angry with me because I told her that her dress was too expensive but I ended up paying a lot more for my daughters clothes. So I told her that I'll always spend more money on my daughter than her. Which just made her even more upset. We ended up arguing and she left. It's been almost a week and she's been mad at me this whole time. And whenever we talk she always brings it up. And I'm honestly just starting to question if maybe I was an asshole?

I'm going to try and take the perspective of your girlfriend here as not a gold digger.\n\nYour girlfriend probably sees that you treat your daughter extra special every time you see her. You plan fancy dinners, trips outdoors, and real bonding experiences. I imagine you see your girlfriend a lot when your daughter isn't around between visits but because you see her more often, the bonding experience feels less special or impactful as what she may imagine your time with your daughter is like.

I think the wording of how you discussed her joining is important. Like you we\u2019re going ice skating but only payed for your daughters skates but not your date? Shopping was the activity and she might have had an expectation of what that ment. \n\nYou might want to be careful in the future of what you invite her along to. It kinda sounds like she\u2019s temporary and not someone that you would want to invest in. Also by not buying the dress it might have seemed like you were saying she wasn\u2019t worth that.

You shouldn't compare them that way. Setting it up where both are there and you plan to pay for both their clothes, and then telling gf it's too expensive while paying more for daughter...

I would expect that and be honestly alarmed if a guy I dated didn't think that way.

But not about the clothes.  \n\nYou're a Part-time parent who seems to think that buying and treating your daughter is going to make up for the time you aren't there.  Spoiler alert, it doesn't.  Plus, you leave the difficult parts of parenting, and the things that actually make a person kind, compassionate, and well-rounded, to your ex. \n\nAnd, your (soon to be ex) girlfriend sees all of this, hears you say \"I'll always spend more on my daughter than you\", and probably takes that at face value.  What if she gets sick or needs help in some way?  Well, can't do it because \"baby girl needs designer shoes\".  \n\nThat's called being a bad parent and a bad partner.", "NTA. She expects you to pay for her?", "NTA. How about the girlfriend pays for her own stuff and also minds her own business?", "NTA", "NTA I can't get past the part where she didn't pay for her own clothes.\n\nShe's an adult, right? Why on earth would you pay for her dress? Why on earth does she ask you to buy her clothes? I'm so confused.", "You NTA, but your girlfriend is. This is not the girlfriend for you. Find a better partner. You are a great dad.", "NTA. your gilrfriend is a piece of work. of course you will spend more money with your daughter, SHE is YOUR DAUGHTER!!!", "NTA.

Your daughter is a child who cannot make more than minimum wage, obviously your will buy all of her clothes and spend more on her. She also needs more clothes because she is growing. Does your gf have a job? Why would you girlfriend expect you to buy a dress for her that she didn\u2019t even want to buy for herself??? Like clearly it was either you make the purchase or she wasn\u2019t gonna buy it, because to her it wasn\u2019t worth spending HER money on, only YOUR money. \n\nIt sounds like she came shopping to compete with your daughter for your love, and now she is pissed she lost a competition no one else even knew about.", "NTA, but you need to watch out for women like this. Speaking as the once-preteen/teenage daughter of divorced parents, this is the start of a lot of unnecessary drama. I stayed with my dad on weekends after my parents split. He had girlfriends leave him because he \u201cspent too much time with me\u201d and they couldn\u2019t handle him BEING A DAD. Most of them were mothers too! With their own children older than I was at the time! And they had their own solo time with him, so it wasn\u2019t like I was monopolizing his time.

I\u2019m a brat too and expect things from my husband. I\u2019m married now I\u2019m just saying people with kids are annoying and time consuming to me. To each their own.

Perhaps, it would be better to date someone who acts like a grown up, is not entitled and is not jealous of your child.", "Dump your girlfriend. She's an adult who should be paying for her own clothes. No normal woman would expect a man to buy her a dress or tantrum because he bought his child clothes and not her. \n\nYour daughter deserves to be treated well, she's your child. Find a good woman who will treat her too, not behave like a child.", "I hate people who thinks they're entitled to their partner's money. They're pathetic in my eyes.

But if you\u2019re moving in with someone with the goal of marriage if that person is erratic with cash it is something you can mention. if you\u2019re just incredibly loose with money in other aspects of life as well, going out to dinner every night, buying new appliances you don\u2019t really need constantly, picking up the bill whenever you\u2019re in a group etc.Then MAYBE I could see her being like this guy is bad with money and even with that won\u2019t buy me stuff am I even a priority, in a more general life sense not related to your daughter.", "Is your gf a grown person? Just sayin.

The question is valid, does OP put effort into his relationship with his gf? Does he take her to nice restaurants, or is that strictly for his daughter?\n\nIt made such a difference to me when, after 15 years of marriage, my husband actually started taking me on dates again.
