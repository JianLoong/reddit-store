Since we both just graduated highschool this has not been a big issue for me as we have been able to live with my parents rent free while we both go to college. I am making enough to afford our own apartment and have been wanting to get an apartment for almost a year now. Almost exactly a year ago, I asked him to start looking for a job because I wanted to be able to split the cost of the apartment, and I agreed to stay together at my parents' until he can find something. Flash forward to now, I'm getting really restless being with my parents and would really like to move out, but my partner has still been unable to find work (yes he has been applying, and I have even applied for him). He got a few offers but he didn't like any of them (too far to travel, bad hours, not a good environment etc.) He just got his bartending license so we are hopeful that he will find something soon. Anyways, I have found the perfect apartment in the exact location we want, it has all the features I've been hoping for and is well within my desired price range so I have decided to go forward and sign the lease and plan to move in by the end of the month. My question is this. \n\nWIBTA for asking my partner to move back into his parents house until he can afford to split the rent with me? It is very much my desire to live together, but I'm also anxious about ending up being the sole breadwinner for an unknown time period if there is no pressure/incentive for him to find work/accept a job offer even if it doesn't seem ideal? I know he has somewhere to go but I also know he wouldn't be as happy there as he would be with me, and when I suggested this to him he was understanding but expressed that obviously it's not his preference. So what do you think? Am I letting my anxiety get the best of me and causing unnecessary stress to my partner when it would cost me the same to have him live with me or not? Or is it justifiable to ask him to move out so I can feel assured that he will do his best to get a job as soon as possible?", "created_utc": 1681740905, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12phnyy/wibta_for_making_my_partner_move_in_with_his/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In today\u2019s world that\u2019s absurd, at this point he really needs to get the experience. Is he just very picky?\n\nNTA for asking, I think that\u2019s reasonable and he absolutley should be providing and be expected to pay equal rent. But you might have to prepare for the possible blowback if he does not like it.", "NTA.  You're being smart.  He's found all sorts of excuses to NOT work. If you move in together and he's not working, he has ZERO reason to find a job.", "NTA, this seems like a completely sound strategy. As you note, he's not 'unable to find work' he's unwilling to work, having turned down multiple offers. As I'm sure you know, no job he accepts has to be the forever thing, but it seems to me that he doesn't have motivation to take a job unless it's a perfect fit, and this is a red flag. He should have taken one of those offers whilst continuing to look for better options if the accepted job wasn't a perfect fit. \n\nI'm reading between the lines here, that you have concern he isn't actually motivated to work, and as long as he isn't actually faced with a real need to work, he's unlikely to start contributing his fair share. I would agree with that concern. Your approach would be a good way to not step into that role of supporting someone who doesn't have any real intent to work, and you protect yourself from the long-term financial and emotional issues that would come from having that dynamic.", "NTA. A job beats no job. One doesn't get to start at the top. You work for that.", "\"WIBTA for asking my partner to move back into his parents house until he can afford to split the rent with me?\"\n\nNo, NTA.  He needs to show the motivation and ability to be financially stable.  Otherwise, you'll be feeding 2 mouths and building resentment.", "NTA. In fact, I think it's the only pragmatic option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm also anxious about ending up being the sole breadwinner for an unknown time period if there is no pressure/incentive for him to find work/accept a job offer even if it doesn't seem ideal?\n\nI agree with your concern. With the economy the way it's been for the last two years, anyone who couldn't find a job isn't really trying\u2014or, I suspect, trying really hard *not* to find work. In my location, we've had restaurants open only a couple days per week for lack of wait staff, pools hiring 15-year-olds as lifeguards, $1000 signing bonuses for supermarket cashiers (with full benefits), etc.\n\nHe can work at a non-ideal job while he searches for a better one.\n\nThat said, he might contribute in other ways besides earning an income, with housework, etc. How has he been at your parents' house? Has he done more than his fair share of housework, taken it upon himself to cook meals for the entire family, etc.? If he hasn't lifted a finger to help, or only helps when asked, don't expect him to change when he moves in with you.", "Info: what's \"bad hours\" or \"too far to travel\" in context?  Does he want to be able to walk to work and only work weekdays 9-5 or are these like, overnight shifts with a two hour each-way commute?", "NTA. He's had an offer and he's being picky. Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do to put food on the table. If he doesn't get over being this picky, will you always be left holding the bag?", "Definitely NTA! As a matter of fact, I think that's the best and healthiest decision to make in your situation.\n\nI'm sorry but your bf is doing something wrong if it has taken him this long to get a job. I understand the world is different post-Covid, but he must not be giving it his all in interviews, or he's self-sabotaging somehow, because 3 years without a job is literally insane to me.\n\nIt honestly seems like he doesn't genuinely want to work, and it seems like he doesn't really have to considering he's been leeching off of you and your family. If you really want a job, then you'll go out and get one. I've done 10 interviews in one day, there's really no excuse other than straight up not caring!\n\nIf he moves into your apartment, you'll continue to pull his weight and pay the bills. Time for tough love.", "NTA and it does cost more to live together instead of alone.\nGas, electricity, water and food cost depend on the number of people who use it.", "NTA - If he wants to live somewhere other than his parents' home then he needs to put in the work to make that happen. He has turned down job offers, which means he has turned down the opportunity to live in an apartment with you. \n\nIf it were me, I would be hesitant to let him move in until he has at least a year's worth of consistent work experience (e.g. no quitting without something else lined up, no getting fired, no \"taking time off\" by significantly cutting back his hours) in addition to him being able to cover 50% of the expenses. \n\nYou two are young, not married, and I assume you don't share any children. This is not the time for your subsidize his choice to be unemployed. This is the time that you two need to prove to yourselves and each other that you can be responsible functioning adults. Moving in together in your own place is completely different than the two of you living with your parents. \n\nAlso - if you do move forward with your plan to get an apartment without him, you and he need to have a serious discussion about what that means logistically. If he ends up staying over every night anyway, then he is just living there without any of the responsibility. I am not sure how you navigate that, especially since you have already been living together at your parents' house, but it is something you need to think about.", "YWNBTA; however, and I don't mean it in a mean way but he might just need to take a job even if the hours are bad or so, because 1. a job is better than no job and 2. often you have to work up and you just need a job to get started and better job opportunities and honestly after a year or 3 years?... That's a long time...", "NTA. Tell him that it's fine for him to move in when he has done bartending for about a year and decided that it's his career for the future. Point out that you aren't \"good at motivating him\" to find/keep a job and that you don't want him to be tempted to just quit when the job gets tough. \n\nI would strongly recommend that you ask your landlord to put a clause in your lease saying that you aren't allowed to have a roommate without permission. Explain the issue to the landlord and tell him/her to ONLY accept a roommate if you contact them without your bf there and confirm that you want your bf to move in. \n\nI'm not sure of the laws about renting and roommates, but you might also want to ask for a clause that says the rent won't increase if a roommate shows up.", "You WNBTA. This is indeed a perfect plan and the outcome will tell you exactly what you need to know about the future of this relationship.", "YWNBTA. He may need to get a not-great job at first, but the fact that he's being picky about his options doesn't sound good. Maybe this will give him the incentive to get a job? Or maybe you'll realize someone who needs to be treated like a child to get a reward isn't someone you want to plan a future with.", "NTA\n\nIm of the belief that noone should be the \"sole breadwinner\" in a relationship with no kids, unless the one working is fine with it and it is established prior.\n\nYou made it clear you want him to work, and this is a good way to incentivize him to get one before he moves in.", "Nta, do not move in with him until he has a job and can prove he can keep the job. I honestly wouldn't even let him stay at your apartment over night more than 2 nights a week because then it will just slowly morph into more.", "NTA. If you're gonna be the only one paying for it, then you choose who stays. He knew he needed a job to share an apartment with you. Also, he can't be picky when applying for jobs. Has he had a job before? If this is his first job, then he better lower his standards", "YWNBTA\n\nI'm also anxious about ending up being the sole breadwinner for an unknown time period if there is no pressure/incentive for him to find work/accept a job offer even if it doesn't seem ideal\n\nYOU ARE CORRECT ABOUT THIS. The fact that he's been unemployed for 3 years and is turning down jobs because they aren't ideal is a huge red flag. He's making himself less and less employable as more time goes by with him being unemployed. Hopefully, he uses his bartender license... but bartending isn't easy, it's a job with a lot of pressure, where you have to be sociable the whole time, and the hours are when everyone goes out to have fun. I'm kind of suspicious that he wont actually like bartending even if he gets a job doing it. I think you absolutely need to stand your ground and not let him move in with you until he has a job AND works that job for at least a couple months. And I would even say if he does hold down a job and moves in with you, you should have an agreement with him drawn up that says if he quits or loses his job, he can't continue living with you. Don't get stuck with a moocher in your apartment. He's already been mooching off of your family living with you and your parents rent free. And you said you have been asking him to look for work and applying for him... girl, I don't know about this guy. He seems too comfortable just living off of other people. Have you thought about dating other people? You might find it really refreshing to be with someone who actually supports themselves, has spending money, lives independently. You two started dating real young, you should see what else is out there for you.", "NTA for asking him to move back with his parents. In fact, this is the better option even if he finds employment. You're in the wrong stage of life to cohabitate. It's a massive mistake to live with a romantic partner as a traditional college student. It is a perilously bad idea to place a teenage relationship at the center of your educational plans. It's a sure sign of your youth and immaturity that you're trying to rush headlong into full blown adulthood and don't recognize where you actually are in life. You can't allow a break-up to derail your education. \n\nYou've been in this relationship for too long. It isn't healthy for a 19 year old to be in a 5 year relationship. Stop playing at being an adult and embrace your youth, naivete, and inexperience. Now is the time to grow and learn as an individual, not to hang on to your childhood and a decision made by your 14 year old brain. You don't know who you are outside of this relationship which is not a good thing. The dynamics of these long-term childhood romances are set early on and likely will never develop into a healthy adult relationship, but neither of you will know any better until this one is over and you start something new with and as an adult. Don't put your eggs in his basket.", "NTA. I think this is a very wise decision. Once a situation is in place it's very difficult to fix. If I were you, I wouldn't let him move in until he kept the job for a while. Otherwise, he could get the job and then decide after he moved in the he doesn't like the environment there either.", "NTA you both should have finances together that way you can both grow financially at the same time.", "NTA. This is very sensible. Nicely reasoned OP.", "Nope. Do NOT start off by paying this guys rent. If he pouts or complains treat that like a character and maturity test. No adult should be turning down jobs and then expect their partner to float them. NTA.", "NTA - Your boyfriend seems to be a little lazy.  He's had years to get a job and hasn't found one, I call BS.  \n\nHe is too comfortable living for free now, just wait until he moves in with you and  you have to foot the bill.  \n\nHe wants to act like a child and not work, send him home to Mommy and Daddy and let him be their problem until he grows up.", "NTA but I would consider breaking up with him. He sounds....not good.", "NAH\n\n\nDo what is in your best interest. Can't rule him TA here. Him being picky has left him having to relocate and that's in him.", "NTA. As an adult, you generally don't get to pick a job that you find no faults with. There are compromises that have to be made.", "NTA. He's being picky about jobs when he can't afford to be. After 3 years, he should have found something that's reasonable enough to do until better comes along.", "NTA and in addition to waiting until he has a job and can split the bills, please sit down and make an agreement about who will do what chores, and to what standard when you move in together. The Fair Play system is a great way to make this work.", "NTA\n\nThere's so many people on reddit with stories along the lines of \"my boyfriend and I moved in together and he doesn't have a job, won't get one, and relies on my for everything\" and your plan makes sure you're not one of them.
