We decided at the end of 2021 we wanted to try for another baby beginning Jan 2022. From January - March we had no positive tests and figured the second one may be more challenging. Then in April my sister got engaged to her now fianc\u00e9. \n\nMy husband and I decided we would stop trying until we knew the wedding date so we did not bring a newborn to a wedding or have a due date really close to it. They found a venue they loved and booked it for May 2023. We waited until we were in the clear of this date range to begin trying again so that we wouldn\u2019t have a newborn or have me ready to burst in the same time frame. \n\nOnce we were in the time frame of June 2023 we decided to continue trying but assumed it would take awhile as we hadn\u2019t gotten pregnant from Jan-March of this year. Turns out it was only one more try necessary and I am now expecting and will be 30 weeks for their wedding. \n\nWe have just now started telling our family that we are expecting and opted to tell my sister and her fianc\u00e9 first to let them know I will be 30 weeks and that we will be there as long as I am not on bed rest or anything else happens. The venue is 45 mins from our house and 25 mins from the hospital. So far it is a healthy pregnancy, and I had no complications with my first. \n\nI expected her to be happy for me but she is incredibly angry with me and feels that my baby will take away from her wedding day. I feel as though I really tip toed around her wedding and even put a pause on my own plans for her and her day. I genuinely thought this would take more time than it did as we had issues the beginning of the year. I even asked if she wanted to replace me in the wedding if she\u2019s more comfortable with that but she has yet to respond to me. \n\nNow that we\u2019re telling family my mom thinks I\u2019m awful for making her wedding about me, my other sister said I should\u2019ve told the family our plans first to determine what was best.

Did she ask you to do that or did you tell her to do that, and WHY did you do that? \n\nBecause, in my opinion you never should done that or normalized any expectation from her that your pregnancy would be planned so as not to interfere with her wedding. When you give people an inch, they take a mile.  You should have just planned your own family without any regard for whether your baby might come around the time of her wedding.", "NTA. \n\nI thought weddings were supposed to be expressions of love, and creating family.   Yeah, you're pregnant.    Tell all the family ahead of time, and then no one will be fussing over you.   \n\nIf your sister still thinks you'll detract from her day, and your mom won't come around, I'd say take a nice family vacation somewhere for the weekend, and get yourself a nice mani-pedi with your daughter.   Oh, and for a wedding present, give them a box of condoms, as they wouldn't want a pregnancy to detract from their marriage.", "NTA. I have no idea why anyone would think it\u2019s appropriate to freak out over someone being pregnant at their wedding- was your SIL expecting everyone else to put their lives on pause for her special day?

I get people not wanting children at their weddings, it makes sense. But no pregnant people? WTAF? Is this family creating more family? Or is it I want to play dolls?", "OMG.....you will be pregnant at a wedding!?!\n\nI don't understand the need for people to have the \"perfect aesthetic\" for a wedding.  You ask people whom you care for and are important to you to be in your wedding.  Who cares what they look like?  Can someone be more shallow?\n\nAlso, how entitled can a bride be to expect someone hold off family planning because they got engaged.  No one has the right to tell you when and if you should have procreate.  \n\nYou are NOT making the wedding about yourself.  No one outshines the bride on her wedding day unless they decide to strip on the main table or something.  Such insecurity is ridiculous.  You are her SISTER...FAMILY.  She should be happy for you, not being the quintessential bridezilla.

I feel robbed.", "I would\u2019ve took the attention off myself with how I would\u2019ve cooed over the baby", "Me three. \nNTA.\n\nAnd Congrats!", "Yup, because they won't drink, and the only reason why someone would ever not drink is that they're pregnant, and then OMG PREGNANT PERSON AT MY WEDDING!", "NTA why do people think they own the year if they are getting married,  you were extremely nice to stop trying so you wouldn't risk not being able to attend.", "Oh, you awful person! You dared to get pregnant at an inconvenient time for your family!\n\nNTA. Your sister needs a reality check. You're going to be 30 weeks at the wedding, not in immediate danger of popping out the baby between the soup and the main course.", "It's ONE day. People can't put their lives on hold for a year so that someone else can have ONE day. Come on. People get pregnant every day. WTF \n\nJust tell her you're not going. She can have her perfect day, you don't have to deal with her, and you can go LC without a problem cos she's definitely in bridezilla territory. \n\nJFC what is wrong with people", "NTA what\u2019s wrong with people", "NTA - nobody gets to control your life because they\u2019re getting married. There is *literally no possible way* that you could be the asshole, unless maybe you decided to try to time your pregnancy and get a low-key induction so that you\u2019d go into labor during their vows or something.", "NTA. Honestly, you sound like the most well adjusted person in your family. It\u2019s unhinged to expect someone to put their life on hold for a damn wedding. Congrats on #2!", "NTA\n\nWhy do people even care that other people also have lives. They\u2019d be a lot happier if they just went with the flow.", "Good lord! Don\u2019t ever feel guilty for being pregnant. There\u2019s always going to be some event. You and your husband are the only ones to make a decision when the time is right for you both. This \u201dyou can\u2019t be pregnant at my wedding\u201d shit is utterly ridiculous. Congratulations. Hope you have a healthy pregnancy, and you are NTA", "I really hate posts like this. Like the title is Clear you are NTA. Just stop. These are just posts for upvotes", "Nta. What are you supposed to do put your life and family planning on hold. What if you're healthy now and something happens a year later and you might have bump in the road. \n\nHonestly reddit stories like this made me a mess when I got pregnant and I was in my sister's wedding I was so scared to tell her I had a horrible panic attack. Thankfully she just wanted to make sure me and the baby was okay and even accommodated me at her wedding.", ">Now that we\u2019re telling family my mom thinks I\u2019m awful for making her wedding about me, my other sister said I should\u2019ve told the family our plans first to determine what was best.\n\nThe fuck is wrong with these people?       \n\nYou aren't making the wedding about you.         \nThe only person you had to discuss your plans with was your husband.\n\n\n\nNTA", "NTA, I can\u2019t imagine giving a fraction of a fuck about who\u2019s pregnant at my wedding, lmao. \n\nIf anything it just means you can tell the baby in the future that they attended your wedding while inside their moms belly, which kids always love/get confused about.", "NTA. \n\nThe fact that you stopped trying for several months because of her wedding plans is already completely bonkers.", "NTA, but I think it\u2019s a little silly to think it would take a while because you didn\u2019t get pregnant in the first 2-3 months.", "NTA\n\nShe gets one day. She doesn\u2019t get to determine what you do with your life for an entire year. Congrats on the pregnancy. Don\u2019t let your sister ruin it for you.", "NTA I would just say don't worry I will not be there.", "NTA. I\u2019m honestly astounded at how unreasonable people can be. You did absolutely nothing wrong and the fact that they can\u2019t be happy for you is frankly disgusting.", "Absolutely agree with you. OP even tried to give her what she wanted, the plan just didn't pan out.", "Honestly I'd just say fine ef you and not go then. NTA", "I'm pretty sure \"a fucking committee\" would be the correct place to approve that.", "We brought our 8 week old son to my brother\u2019s wedding. Years later I was 7/12 months pregnant (and carrying very big!) at my BIL\u2019s wedding. Guess what, everyone survived, the brides were beautiful and the center of attention and the pictures came out nice. Wedding culture and entitlement in general is way out of control (sigh)"]}
