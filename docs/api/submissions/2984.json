We decided at the end of 2021 we wanted to try for another baby beginning Jan 2022. From January - March we had no positive tests and figured the second one may be more challenging. Then in April my sister got engaged to her now fianc\u00e9. \n\nMy husband and I decided we would stop trying until we knew the wedding date so we did not bring a newborn to a wedding or have a due date really close to it. They found a venue they loved and booked it for May 2023. We waited until we were in the clear of this date range to begin trying again so that we wouldn\u2019t have a newborn or have me ready to burst in the same time frame. \n\nOnce we were in the time frame of June 2023 we decided to continue trying but assumed it would take awhile as we hadn\u2019t gotten pregnant from Jan-March of this year. Turns out it was only one more try necessary and I am now expecting and will be 30 weeks for their wedding. \n\nWe have just now started telling our family that we are expecting and opted to tell my sister and her fianc\u00e9 first to let them know I will be 30 weeks and that we will be there as long as I am not on bed rest or anything else happens. The venue is 45 mins from our house and 25 mins from the hospital. So far it is a healthy pregnancy, and I had no complications with my first. \n\nI expected her to be happy for me but she is incredibly angry with me and feels that my baby will take away from her wedding day. I feel as though I really tip toed around her wedding and even put a pause on my own plans for her and her day. I genuinely thought this would take more time than it did as we had issues the beginning of the year. I even asked if she wanted to replace me in the wedding if she\u2019s more comfortable with that but she has yet to respond to me. \n\nNow that we\u2019re telling family my mom thinks I\u2019m awful for making her wedding about me, my other sister said I should\u2019ve told the family our plans first to determine what was best.

Did she ask you to do that or did you tell her to do that, and WHY did you do that? \n\nBecause, in my opinion you never should done that or normalized any expectation from her that your pregnancy would be planned so as not to interfere with her wedding. When you give people an inch, they take a mile.  You should have just planned your own family without any regard for whether your baby might come around the time of her wedding.", "NTA. \n\nI thought weddings were supposed to be expressions of love, and creating family.   Yeah, you're pregnant.    Tell all the family ahead of time, and then no one will be fussing over you.   \n\nIf your sister still thinks you'll detract from her day, and your mom won't come around, I'd say take a nice family vacation somewhere for the weekend, and get yourself a nice mani-pedi with your daughter.   Oh, and for a wedding present, give them a box of condoms, as they wouldn't want a pregnancy to detract from their marriage.", "NTA. I have no idea why anyone would think it\u2019s appropriate to freak out over someone being pregnant at their wedding- was your SIL expecting everyone else to put their lives on pause for her special day?

I get people not wanting children at their weddings, it makes sense. But no pregnant people? WTAF? Is this family creating more family? Or is it I want to play dolls?", "OMG.....you will be pregnant at a wedding!?!\n\nI don't understand the need for people to have the \"perfect aesthetic\" for a wedding.  You ask people whom you care for and are important to you to be in your wedding.  Who cares what they look like?  Can someone be more shallow?\n\nAlso, how entitled can a bride be to expect someone hold off family planning because they got engaged.  No one has the right to tell you when and if you should have procreate.  \n\nYou are NOT making the wedding about yourself.  No one outshines the bride on her wedding day unless they decide to strip on the main table or something.  Such insecurity is ridiculous.  You are her SISTER...FAMILY.  She should be happy for you, not being the quintessential bridezilla.

We joked that her belly made the bride look very skinny. \n\nNTA", "NTA This logic makes no sense to me. How will a pregnant person be distracting at a wedding? What's wrong with people?", "NTA.  What. The. Hell.  First I can't believe you actually tried to plan your baby around a damn wedding.  And now it is the end of the world because you will actually be pregnant at this show stopping wedding???  Seriously?  Tell all of them to get the hell over it.  It's a wedding - that's all.", "No. No no no. NTA. How dare you have a life aside from your sister?! \ud83d\ude44 Maybe your sister should\u2019ve known you wanted another child and put *her* plans on hold for *you*. How ridiculous of her, and anyone who agrees, to be upset about this.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your family does not get to dictate when you are allowed to have a child.    That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.   Only you and your partner get to decide when having a child is best for you.   So no.   NTA.", "NTA - I\u2019m not letting my family manage/schedule/control my sex life. Fuck that noise.", "NTA you can't help.beong pregnant telling people.your pregnant at sister wedding is a  big no no but already being 30 weeks well there nothing you can do about that", "NTA ---- Imagine being so insecure that you are jealous of a baby that hasn't even been born yet.", "NTA since when are you obligated to plan your pregnancy around someone else's wedding? Have you asked them to reschedule their wedding so that it doesn't take away from your pregnancy?", "NTA- and I would simply say- our family planning is nobody's business but ours. This baby is a blessing and we are beyond thrilled and grateful because there are no guarantees. I am sorry that somehow you all have decided that my family planning should be organized around a wedding but I do not and cannot feel that way. If you want me not to come, then I will honor that- but I will not apologize for having this child now or ever.", "NTA. It doesn't seem like your family is aware, but your sister is not the main character and the world doesn't revolve around her or her wedding. You and your SO wanted a baby. So you decided to make a baby. That is no one else's decision but yours. I honestly wouldn't show up to the wedding after their response to what should be happy news. It also seems like your parents are shitty and have a favorite daughter, and it isn't you unfortunately.", "YWNBTA unless by some scientific miracle, the earth begins to revolve around your sister before next spring.", "NTA.  I went to a wedding about that pregnant.  People mentioned it here or there but that was it.", "NTA\n\nDo you come from a family of narcissists?  It is seriously messed up for your entire family to act like you need to put your life on pause or plan your sex out in advance with them for a wedding.  Next time you see them, give them each a calendar and ask them to mark the appropriate days you will be allowed to have sex so that you don't ruin any future plans for them.  Your family sucks and you should skip the wedding and not have anything to do with any of their unsupportive selves.", "NTA\n\nBabies are a normal part of life. Your sister is silly to expect no one to come to her wedding pregnant. It does not distract from the bride. She's over the top, and so is your mom. Your baby will likely be born a good ten weeks after the wedding.", "WTF, how did the understandable rule of, \u201cdon\u2019t announce your pregnancy at someone\u2019s wedding\u201d morph into \u201cdon\u2019t be pregnant AT ALL during the wedding\u201d?!\n\nNTA and other people\u2019s lives do not get to revolve around yours just because you\u2019re getting hitched.", "My Aunt was 4 months pregnant at my parents wedding. I was 4 months pregnant at my sisters wedding. Neither of them had any issues with us being pregnant in the photos and I was even in my sisters wedding party. \n\nNTA", "Umm... NTA. Next time you're in a conversation, you should ask if they'd like you to get an abortion so you're not pregnant for the wedding. Your sister sounds like a nightmare. It's just a wedding.... You're carrying her new family member.", "What does she think the baby is going to do, crawl out and cut the cake? NTA but your sister sounds like a difficult bride. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be excluded from the wedding party over this, take the out and enjoy your pregnancy. Congratulations on your growing family!", "NTA... towards everyone else. Towards yourself?\n\nI was a relatively easy pregnancy for my mom. My younger brother? Not so much. Should've asked yourself \"do I want to be X weeks pregnant at this wedding?\"\n\nCongrats btw, I mean that genuinely! But take it easy on yourself!", "NTA. Too stupid for words.", "What in the actual hell!!!!!! This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. And I'm very sad that you feel it necessary to even ask this question.\n\nAbsolutely, 1,000% NTA.\n\nTell them all to shove. You should never have had to even consider planning a family around someone else's family.", "NTA\nYour sis is dumb", "I literally just muttered \"WTF is wrong with people\"   100% agree with you.   Must be nice to let your family control your sex life and when you can and can't have children.  Damn these people are stupid.", "There definitely is gonna be drama around this, and OP, please to look out for the microaggressions from the family about this and don't be afraid to put them in LC or timeout if they cross any boundaries.\n\nYou've already put half a year of your life on hold and they're treating you like crap, so don't sweat it if they can't stomach you living your life. NTA", "Yup. My sister had to miss my wedding because of COVID. We skyped the ceremony, and had her video chat with me while I was getting ready. She was pregnant when I was finally able to have my reception with all the friends and family we'd originally wanted to have come, a year later. My reaction: I was super happy to see her and spend time with her and told her she was beautiful and glowing. \n\nI also don't understand what is wrong with some people. Someone else's happiness shouldn't detract from your own! It should add to it.", "When one of my aunts was getting married her sister was pregnant. She was the matron of honor and the running joke was that she was going to \u2018water the bride\u2019s bouquet\u2019 at the altar. Baby was born three days later. No one batted an eye or gave the mom to be any extra attention except for making sure she had a chair when it wasn\u2019t necessary for her to stand and juice and water at the ready in case it was needed.", "I have no idea what\u2019s wrong w the OPs family. A wedding is a party and celebration. The entire course of humanity does not stop at someone\u2019s wedding. Nor should it nor should they even consider that request. \n\nNTA. And these people need some perspective.", "It sounds less like they think OP being pregnant will interfere in her being able to do things, and more like they think that her visible pregnancy will draw everyone else's attention and cause everyone to fawn all over her and ignore the bride.\n\nThis seems ludicrous to me, but I don't know, maybe nobody in that family knows how to act around a pregnant woman?\n\nOP is NTA. THEY are the ones making this all about her and her pregnancy. Not her.", "Agree with this NTA! It's absolutely wild to tiptoe around your sister to the point of trying to time a pregnancy around her wedding and then your reward is still a tantrum. I'm sorry your family sucks this much, and I hope this situation helps you see that so you can put some of the effort you've wasted on trying to make them happy (they will never be happy) into doing what makes the most sense for you.", "There was actually an Aita where a family expected the op to do just that.\nETA I can't find the original but here's a cross post https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/comments/xsup2x/sister_and_family_suggest_oop_get_an_abortion_so/", "It sounds like OP didn\u2019t want to risk missing the wedding because she had just given birth or was about to give birth, which is is understandable.", "Me too. \n\nNTA.", "Agree agree agree agree AGREEEEEEE", "Christ! That's not right.", "Oh yeah, that's fair.", "Also could you imagine showing up with a newborn to a wedding. Everyone would be wanting to see or hold baby.", "Never was a problem in my family. I guess we just like each other and don't start stupid drama about nothing."]}
