We decided at the end of 2021 we wanted to try for another baby beginning Jan 2022. From January - March we had no positive tests and figured the second one may be more challenging. Then in April my sister got engaged to her now fianc\u00e9. \n\nMy husband and I decided we would stop trying until we knew the wedding date so we did not bring a newborn to a wedding or have a due date really close to it. They found a venue they loved and booked it for May 2023. We waited until we were in the clear of this date range to begin trying again so that we wouldn\u2019t have a newborn or have me ready to burst in the same time frame. \n\nOnce we were in the time frame of June 2023 we decided to continue trying but assumed it would take awhile as we hadn\u2019t gotten pregnant from Jan-March of this year. Turns out it was only one more try necessary and I am now expecting and will be 30 weeks for their wedding. \n\nWe have just now started telling our family that we are expecting and opted to tell my sister and her fianc\u00e9 first to let them know I will be 30 weeks and that we will be there as long as I am not on bed rest or anything else happens. The venue is 45 mins from our house and 25 mins from the hospital. So far it is a healthy pregnancy, and I had no complications with my first. \n\nI expected her to be happy for me but she is incredibly angry with me and feels that my baby will take away from her wedding day. I feel as though I really tip toed around her wedding and even put a pause on my own plans for her and her day. I genuinely thought this would take more time than it did as we had issues the beginning of the year. I even asked if she wanted to replace me in the wedding if she\u2019s more comfortable with that but she has yet to respond to me. \n\nNow that we\u2019re telling family my mom thinks I\u2019m awful for making her wedding about me, my other sister said I should\u2019ve told the family our plans first to determine what was best.

Did she ask you to do that or did you tell her to do that, and WHY did you do that? \n\nBecause, in my opinion you never should done that or normalized any expectation from her that your pregnancy would be planned so as not to interfere with her wedding. When you give people an inch, they take a mile.  You should have just planned your own family without any regard for whether your baby might come around the time of her wedding.", "NTA. \n\nI thought weddings were supposed to be expressions of love, and creating family.   Yeah, you're pregnant.    Tell all the family ahead of time, and then no one will be fussing over you.   \n\nIf your sister still thinks you'll detract from her day, and your mom won't come around, I'd say take a nice family vacation somewhere for the weekend, and get yourself a nice mani-pedi with your daughter.   Oh, and for a wedding present, give them a box of condoms, as they wouldn't want a pregnancy to detract from their marriage.", "NTA. I have no idea why anyone would think it\u2019s appropriate to freak out over someone being pregnant at their wedding- was your SIL expecting everyone else to put their lives on pause for her special day? Like great aunt Millie isn\u2019t allowed to die either because she\u2019s reserved a venue?\n\nThis is just life and your SIL is being immature as hell.", "NTA. I get people not wanting children at their weddings, it makes sense. But no pregnant people? WTAF? Is this family creating more family? Or is it I want to play dolls?", "OMG.....you will be pregnant at a wedding!?!\n\nI don't understand the need for people to have the \"perfect aesthetic\" for a wedding.  You ask people whom you care for and are important to you to be in your wedding.  Who cares what they look like?  Can someone be more shallow?\n\nAlso, how entitled can a bride be to expect someone hold off family planning because they got engaged.  No one has the right to tell you when and if you should have procreate.  \n\nYou are NOT making the wedding about yourself.  No one outshines the bride on her wedding day unless they decide to strip on the main table or something.  Such insecurity is ridiculous.  You are her SISTER...FAMILY.  She should be happy for you, not being the quintessential bridezilla.
