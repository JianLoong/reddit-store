She and my fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t have the best home life and my fianc\u00e9e was able to come out mostly well adjusted while her sister went in a very different direction.\n\nShe\u2019s a bad kid. I really try to be understanding as I know it\u2019s not 100% on her, but having to deal with her is a nightmare. She skips school frequently, goes out to parties with people she shouldn\u2019t be with, sneaks out, has stolen money from us, is banned from multiple stores for shoplifting. Has stolen weed, alcohol, and psychedelics from us, and countless more things that I don\u2019t have enough characters to list.\n\nThe thing that tops it for me is my fianc\u00e9es behavior toward her. She\u2019s an enabler. She needs discipline her but she refuses to and allows her to walk all over her. I know I\u2019m not her guardian, but she\u2019s living in my house and I don\u2019t want for her to conduct herself this way under my roof. \n\nFriday, she skipped class to go smoke weed with some boy and his parents called the police on them and they brought her to us. I was at my limit with her, and I told her that if she wants to stay here she cannot have the police bringing her home and I was sick and tired of having to be one of the people responsible when she fucks up.\n\nWe got into an argument and my fianc\u00e9e took her to her room to talk to her. Yesterday morning I wake up and go into the living room to start breakfast and I the three Lego sculptures I had made were taken down and threw onto the ground. They were all in pieces. The only way this could\u2019ve happened is if some did it. My fianc\u00e9e had no reason to so I woke up her sister and confronted her.\n\nShe denied it until I said I would just check our security cameras. She confessed and I lost my temper. I told her how much work it was to get her out here to take care of her and how ungrateful she was to us for it. I told her that the disrespect she gives me and her sister who were kind enough to take her in is more than enough reason to Tass her ass on the streets. At this point my fianc\u00e9e came in and her sister started \u201ccrying\u201d saying how I was threatening to throw her out.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e took her side and said I was being an asshole to her as she\u2019s a teenage girl who\u2019s scared and traumatized and she\u2019s acting out because of it.

You took her in and she doesn't have the wherewithal to not act the fool. She's obviously been enabled, \"trauma\" doesn't mean she's allowed to go get high with boys and act how she wants. Not sure how you've threatened to throw your fiance out but I imagine that relationship isn't going to go far based on this. Her support should be going to her future husband.", "NTA. Did you get a say in your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister moving in? Regardless, you and your fianc\u00e9e need to get on the same page around enforcing boundaries and consequences.", "NTA - Now...I don't think the legos are the issue (at least I hope not). It's more the skipping school, drugs, and so on. ALso, the one thing that bothered me is that you said she has stolen weed and psychadelics from you.  A kid living with you really should not have access to your drug stash..in fact, they shouldn't even know that you have one. \n\nI agree that her behavior is in principle unacceptable and can totally understand your desire to not want to be involved, not want the police coming over, etc. and I believe you are well within your rights to state that if the situation is intolerable, that you don't want to be living in it. However, you should also know that this is your partner's family and taking that stance may result in the end of your relationship and again...please keep your drugs and alcohol somewhere where this kid cannot get to them.", "NtA. Sorry to say but the only way is break up and kick both of them out", "NTA, the sister needs to go to therapy, she needs help, i understand your frustration and you have the right to be frustrated, but she also needs all the help she can get, if left alone i wonder what would become of her.", "NTA.  You've said your piece with no effect.  There is no future for you in this picture.  Maybe you should limit your losses and move on.   Little sister needs professional help, she will soon be an addict, and there is nothing that you are qualified to do that will help her.   Best wishes.", "NTA \n\nThe moment you said she starting stealing from you and your fiance hasn't given her sister any repercussions is already too far. It shouldn't fall to you to be the only person calling out her bad behaviour and your fiance is (as you already said) an enabler of it.\n\nHope you are able to have a discussion together and come to a resolution for you all", "ESH. You handled the situation poorly in my opinion, her behavior sucks but she\u2019s also in a tough enough position. Her behavior is due to her circumstances & being a teenager. Her behavior may even escalate by you threatening to toss her out. The behavior goes more towards the \u201cwhy should I give a f*ck at this point.\u201d Which she\u2019s close enough to anyways. \n\nShe needs some guidance & therapy. You & fianc\u00e9 need to come to a baseline agreement on how to function with her sister. Sister probably feels some guilt & that\u2019s where the enabling comes from. Def a hard position for you to be in.", "Info:   Where would she go if you threw her out?  Who is her legal guardian?", "NTA but you probably need to get rid of both of them since big sis will probably just let her back into the house whenever she wants.", "NTA - There\u2019s no win for you in this situation my friend.  \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 has unilaterally decided that you:\n     CANNOT \u2018re-home\u2019 your future SIL\n     CANNOT discipline or otherwise try to correct       \n      FSIL behavior\n     CANNOT hold FSIL accountable for her behavior\n\nYou CAN, however, end your relationship and you should give that serious thought.   Your fianc\u00e9e has demonstrated that she has no respect for you, you home or your art.", "NTA! Look dude both of them are gonna walk all over you if you don\u2019t put ur foot down.", "Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s statement was totally fair. You two need a new strategy. I assume she is her sister\u2019s guardian. So it\u2019s on her to call the play and you to help enforce the rules. It definitely sounds like you all need clearer rules. \n\nBut for threatening a kid who\u2019s acting out with abandonment, especially a kid who\u2019s already clearly been abandoned or worse, YTA.", "NTA. You don't have to enable her. Teenagers are old enough to know right from wrong. It's also pretty concerning that she has access to weed, alcohol, and psychedelics in your home. I don't think it's the right environment for her.", "NTA. I had a difficult childhood and was in many ways a \"bad kid\" along the same general lines as the sister.\n\nI have a lot of sympathy for her but don't think you can or should tolerate that behavior. I don't even really like lego sculptures but think someone who will destroy your valuables because you scolded her about a very legitimate incident is someone that you can have in your house.\n\nThese issues are horribly complicated. Sometime every option is bad. Sometimes every option is so bad it is intolerable.\n\nIf you throw her out, who knows what could happen. She seems wild and unrestrained. It is possible she winds up in jail or dies. Your fianc\u00e9 will probably never forgive herself or you for that. But she may alos see the light and recover. I had friends at that age who went to rehabs and did. I had friends who didn't.\n\nBut if you let her stay and if your fianc\u00e9 keeps enabling her she could still wind up in jail or die. She will make your life miserable and it doesn't sound like she is about to grow out of it.\n\nI think putting her out, or at least making it a real option, is probably the right thing to do. But I am not sure your relationship with you fianc\u00e9 will survive it.\n\nI am also not sure there is a third option or a middle path. I am tempted to say that you and the fianc\u00e9 have to agree that she is now on final probation and that any other incidents will have repercussions. The big problem is that I don't know what that would mean. I assume she doesn't have anywhere else to stay.\n\nI feel terrible for her and hope she can turn things around. I eventually did, but I got a bit lucky.\n\nI do know that I would have a lot of trouble living like you are. I do think you are a good person trying to do the right thing. I hope you get the best result. But it isn't really in your control.", "Weed, alcohol and psychedelics do not make a good home life with children or good parenting.  You can choose for yourself, that's fine, but when you have a kid with substance abuse problems, you are exposing her to your choices.\n\nShe's not a pet rock.  She's a kid that needs intervention, counseling, and real parenting.  ESH   eta clarity", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why is your fianc\u00e9e allowing her to split you? Where are her parents?

I agree with the others that this girl has done unforgivable things. She\u2019s not your responsibility, and your fianc\u00e9e shows a lack of respect for you in making it your responsibility. She has demonstrated that she will prioritize her sister over you every time, even in the wake of such extreme behaviour.

I suggest you stop buying for a while and use that money for some family therapy. Prioritize your FSIL\u2019s mental health obviously, but you and your fianc\u00e9e also need to get on the same team and work out your own issues. At this point something has to give.

Teenagers get destructive in these scenarios but she didn't say punch a hole in the wall or break dishes or some crap she intentionally broke things that belonged to you.

I have to imagine that they knew about the problem behavior before taking the 16yo in.

There might very well be good reasons why she is the way she is, but that doesn't change the fact that she will absolutely not allow this home to be a healthy environment. She doesn't recognize any authority there and worse, she is focusing on revenge (purposely looking for ways to hurt OP).  That absolutely needs to be removed from the household.\n\nFiancee is well-meaning but incapable of dealing with sister. That was already pretty clear from OP's description, this just underscores that it absolutely will not get better if things continue.\n\nOP's anger/frustration is understandable given the circumstances, but fiancee is right that it is not helping the situation. But what's the solution? Pretending not to be angry and frustrated at someone like this who is actively making your life worse? No, that just lets it fester.\n\nOP is NTA here, and continuing on as if there is some magical happy ending just around the corner is not healthy for anyone. Things must change. Sister must go.

Letting her do whatever she wants with no repercussions and then just saying she's \"scared and traumatized\" isn't doing a thing.

The sister is scared and traumatized and some understanding of her situation is needed. HOWEVER, you should not have to accept that  behavior without a plan to address it. The sister needs professional help but unfortunately there is nothing that you can do on that front as you are neither parent nor guardian (does fianc\u00e9e have guardianship?).\n\nWhat you can to do is protect yourself and your mental health.

The little sister needs help but your fianc\u00e9 is not doing it. Therapy is in order for everyone. Or something. Because the little sister will NOT get better as long as big sister keeps enabling.", "NTA - you're not married yet. Kick them both out, you don't deserve to be disrespected in your own home. No freaking way, and she first lied. That's just worse. Did she even say why she did it? Did you fianc\u00e9 ask her she did it???", "INFO: Is sister getting counselling? Are you and your fiancee? Do you as a household have external sources of support, e.g. a social worker or equivalent? How much did you and your fiancee discuss the situation before sister moved in, e.g. setting ground rules and agreeing responsibilities?\n\nNAH. Sister sounds like a very troubled teenager, and unfortunately it sounds like your fiancee isn't giving her the structure or support she needs (i.e. with boundaries and discipline as well as security/stability), probably because she feels some guilt over not being able to help her sister sooner. Yelling at the kid and threatening to make her homeless isn't the way to change her behaviour, either, although your frustration is very understandable.\n\nIf you and your fiancee haven't already had a serious \"where do we go from here?\" conversation, you should definitely do that - preferably with a neutral third party like a counsellor/therapist to facilitate, if possible.
