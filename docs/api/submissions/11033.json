I really try to be understanding as I know it\u2019s not 100% on her, but having to deal with her is a nightmare. She skips school frequently, goes out to parties with people she shouldn\u2019t be with, sneaks out, has stolen money from us, is banned from multiple stores for shoplifting. Has stolen weed, alcohol, and psychedelics from us, and countless more things that I don\u2019t have enough characters to list.\n\nThe thing that tops it for me is my fianc\u00e9es behavior toward her. She\u2019s an enabler. She needs discipline her but she refuses to and allows her to walk all over her. I know I\u2019m not her guardian, but she\u2019s living in my house and I don\u2019t want for her to conduct herself this way under my roof. \n\nFriday, she skipped class to go smoke weed with some boy and his parents called the police on them and they brought her to us. I was at my limit with her, and I told her that if she wants to stay here she cannot have the police bringing her home and I was sick and tired of having to be one of the people responsible when she fucks up.\n\nWe got into an argument and my fianc\u00e9e took her to her room to talk to her. Yesterday morning I wake up and go into the living room to start breakfast and I the three Lego sculptures I had made were taken down and threw onto the ground. They were all in pieces. The only way this could\u2019ve happened is if some did it. My fianc\u00e9e had no reason to so I woke up her sister and confronted her.\n\nShe denied it until I said I would just check our security cameras. She confessed and I lost my temper. I told her how much work it was to get her out here to take care of her and how ungrateful she was to us for it. I told her that the disrespect she gives me and her sister who were kind enough to take her in is more than enough reason to Tass her ass on the streets. At this point my fianc\u00e9e came in and her sister started \u201ccrying\u201d saying how I was threatening to throw her out.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e took her side and said I was being an asshole to her as she\u2019s a teenage girl who\u2019s scared and traumatized and she\u2019s acting out because of it.

You took her in and she doesn't have the wherewithal to not act the fool. She's obviously been enabled, \"trauma\" doesn't mean she's allowed to go get high with boys and act how she wants. Not sure how you've threatened to throw your fiance out but I imagine that relationship isn't going to go far based on this. Her support should be going to her future husband.", "NTA. Did you get a say in your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister moving in? Regardless, you and your fianc\u00e9e need to get on the same page around enforcing boundaries and consequences.", "NTA - Now...I don't think the legos are the issue (at least I hope not). It's more the skipping school, drugs, and so on. ALso, the one thing that bothered me is that you said she has stolen weed and psychadelics from you.  A kid living with you really should not have access to your drug stash..in fact, they shouldn't even know that you have one. \n\nI agree that her behavior is in principle unacceptable and can totally understand your desire to not want to be involved, not want the police coming over, etc. and I believe you are well within your rights to state that if the situation is intolerable, that you don't want to be living in it. However, you should also know that this is your partner's family and taking that stance may result in the end of your relationship and again...please keep your drugs and alcohol somewhere where this kid cannot get to them.", "NtA. Sorry to say but the only way is break up and kick both of them out", "NTA, the sister needs to go to therapy, she needs help, i understand your frustration and you have the right to be frustrated, but she also needs all the help she can get, if left alone i wonder what would become of her.", "NTA.  You've said your piece with no effect.  There is no future for you in this picture.  Maybe you should limit your losses and move on.   Little sister needs professional help, she will soon be an addict, and there is nothing that you are qualified to do that will help her.   Best wishes.", "NTA \n\nThe moment you said she starting stealing from you and your fiance hasn't given her sister any repercussions is already too far. It shouldn't fall to you to be the only person calling out her bad behaviour and your fiance is (as you already said) an enabler of it.\n\nHope you are able to have a discussion together and come to a resolution for you all", "ESH. You handled the situation poorly in my opinion, her behavior sucks but she\u2019s also in a tough enough position. Her behavior is due to her circumstances & being a teenager. Her behavior may even escalate by you threatening to toss her out. The behavior goes more towards the \u201cwhy should I give a f*ck at this point.\u201d Which she\u2019s close enough to anyways. \n\nShe needs some guidance & therapy. You & fianc\u00e9 need to come to a baseline agreement on how to function with her sister. Sister probably feels some guilt & that\u2019s where the enabling comes from. Def a hard position for you to be in.", "Info:   Where would she go if you threw her out?  Who is her legal guardian?", "NTA but you probably need to get rid of both of them since big sis will probably just let her back into the house whenever she wants.", "NTA - There\u2019s no win for you in this situation my friend.  \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 has unilaterally decided that you:\n     CANNOT \u2018re-home\u2019 your future SIL\n     CANNOT discipline or otherwise try to correct       \n      FSIL behavior\n     CANNOT hold FSIL accountable for her behavior\n\nYou CAN, however, end your relationship and you should give that serious thought.   Your fianc\u00e9e has demonstrated that she has no respect for you, you home or your art.", "NTA! Look dude both of them are gonna walk all over you if you don\u2019t put ur foot down.", "Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s statement was totally fair. You two need a new strategy. I assume she is her sister\u2019s guardian. So it\u2019s on her to call the play and you to help enforce the rules. It definitely sounds like you all need clearer rules. \n\nBut for threatening a kid who\u2019s acting out with abandonment, especially a kid who\u2019s already clearly been abandoned or worse, YTA.", "NTA. You don't have to enable her. Teenagers are old enough to know right from wrong. It's also pretty concerning that she has access to weed, alcohol, and psychedelics in your home. I don't think it's the right environment for her.", "NTA. I had a difficult childhood and was in many ways a \"bad kid\" along the same general lines as the sister.\n\nI have a lot of sympathy for her but don't think you can or should tolerate that behavior. I don't even really like lego sculptures but think someone who will destroy your valuables because you scolded her about a very legitimate incident is someone that you can have in your house.\n\nThese issues are horribly complicated. Sometime every option is bad. Sometimes every option is so bad it is intolerable.\n\nIf you throw her out, who knows what could happen. She seems wild and unrestrained. It is possible she winds up in jail or dies. Your fianc\u00e9 will probably never forgive herself or you for that. But she may alos see the light and recover. I had friends at that age who went to rehabs and did. I had friends who didn't.\n\nBut if you let her stay and if your fianc\u00e9 keeps enabling her she could still wind up in jail or die. She will make your life miserable and it doesn't sound like she is about to grow out of it.\n\nI think putting her out, or at least making it a real option, is probably the right thing to do. But I am not sure your relationship with you fianc\u00e9 will survive it.\n\nI am also not sure there is a third option or a middle path. I am tempted to say that you and the fianc\u00e9 have to agree that she is now on final probation and that any other incidents will have repercussions. The big problem is that I don't know what that would mean. I assume she doesn't have anywhere else to stay.\n\nI feel terrible for her and hope she can turn things around. I eventually did, but I got a bit lucky.\n\nI do know that I would have a lot of trouble living like you are. I do think you are a good person trying to do the right thing. I hope you get the best result. But it isn't really in your control.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why is your fianc\u00e9e allowing her to split you? Where are her parents?

I agree with the others that this girl has done unforgivable things. She\u2019s not your responsibility, and your fianc\u00e9e shows a lack of respect for you in making it your responsibility. She has demonstrated that she will prioritize her sister over you every time, even in the wake of such extreme behaviour.

I suggest you stop buying for a while and use that money for some family therapy. Prioritize your FSIL\u2019s mental health obviously, but you and your fianc\u00e9e also need to get on the same team and work out your own issues. At this point something has to give.

That won't go well.  Unfortunately, this really has the potential to end your relationship.  Threatening to throw her out is essentially putting your fiance in a \"Me or her\" situation.

I understand coming from a bad home and needing therapy but this feels like she specifically has an issue with you. Teenagers get destructive in these scenarios but she didn't say punch a hole in the wall or break dishes or some crap she intentionally broke things that belonged to you.

I have to imagine that they knew about the problem behavior before taking the 16yo in.  Removing someone from the original cause of problem behavior does not result in a change to the behavior.  \n\nThis is going to be a long slog; marked by two steps forward and one step back type of progress.  Only if the two adults in the situation have their act together.", "This is the sad but true reality of the situation.\n\nYounger sister is toxic. There might very well be good reasons why she is the way she is, but that doesn't change the fact that she will absolutely not allow this home to be a healthy environment. She doesn't recognize any authority there and worse, she is focusing on revenge (purposely looking for ways to hurt OP).  That absolutely needs to be removed from the household.\n\nFiancee is well-meaning but incapable of dealing with sister. That was already pretty clear from OP's description, this just underscores that it absolutely will not get better if things continue.\n\nOP's anger/frustration is understandable given the circumstances, but fiancee is right that it is not helping the situation. But what's the solution? Pretending not to be angry and frustrated at someone like this who is actively making your life worse? No, that just lets it fester.\n\nOP is NTA here, and continuing on as if there is some magical happy ending just around the corner is not healthy for anyone. Things must change. Sister must go.

I grw up in a small town and had a sister that was similar.  Coos had to being her home all the time. We eventually became that house.  The cops in town even had a nick name for my sister.

He Def needs to get that child out of the house and I would tell the fiance either her sister goes or they both go but he cannot keep doing this.", "Totally agree. Maybe family therapy alongside individual therapy. But like you said, the adults need to get their act together asap or else nothing is going to change & will likely get worse.", "But those clearly aren\u2019t the rules.

No therapist in the world can solve a problem like this. Been there.", "NTA \n\nTime to send kid back to parents", "NTA. It's time to set boundaries though. Your fianc\u00e9e refuses to discipline her sister or even ask her sister to compromise. Is this really how you want to live?

Letting her do whatever she wants with no repercussions and then just saying she's \"scared and traumatized\" isn't doing a thing.

The sister needs professional help but unfortunately there is nothing that you can do on that front as you are neither parent nor guardian (does fianc\u00e9e have guardianship?).\n\nWhat you can to do is protect yourself and your mental health.

Do you as a household have external sources of support, e.g. a social worker or equivalent? How much did you and your fiancee discuss the situation before sister moved in, e.g. setting ground rules and agreeing responsibilities?\n\nNAH. Sister sounds like a very troubled teenager, and unfortunately it sounds like your fiancee isn't giving her the structure or support she needs (i.e. with boundaries and discipline as well as security/stability), probably because she feels some guilt over not being able to help her sister sooner. Yelling at the kid and threatening to make her homeless isn't the way to change her behaviour, either, although your frustration is very understandable.\n\nIf you and your fiancee haven't already had a serious \"where do we go from here?\" conversation, you should definitely do that - preferably with a neutral third party like a counsellor/therapist to facilitate, if possible. You each need to be very clear in what your priorities are, what your boundaries are, and whether you can achieve all of this as a team, in your current living situation.\n\nIt may be that your relationship has hit an end point with the new factor of the sister, sadly. Fiancee may feel that the sister has to be her priority, even if that means losing you (although hopefully she will also realise that things need to change in her relationship with her sister, too, i.e. she needs to start thinking of herself as primarily a parent, with all that implies).

To elaborate, our mother is an abusive, alcoholic, narcissistic who\u2019s traumatized us our entire lives. \n\nMy sister, immediately upon moving in, got a job within a week (she actually had several job offers). She picked up this job without being prompted by us. She took a gap year for college, but has spent months applying (got a few acceptances). She\u2019s made new friends\u2026 and yes, she goes out drinking and does smoke weed, but she does so responsibly. She texts me when she\u2019s going to be out late, or coming back in the morning. She\u2019s proven she\u2019s responsible, so I let her drive my car. Honestly it\u2019s more her car than mine now (fine with that as I don\u2019t drive much).  \n\nFor all the people crying about you having weed and shit\u2026 my fianc\u00e9 and I also partake in smoking, and my sister has never stolen our shit. I\u2019ve never kept it locked up. There\u2019s no need for us to do that though. The fact that your FSIL broke locks to get to your shit is just proof she doesn\u2019t respect y\u2019all. Even if you didn\u2019t have it in the house, she\u2019d find it somewhere. That being said, y\u2019all are gonna have to get more creative about hiding your shit. It\u2019s unfortunate, but she can\u2019t be trusted. \n\nI understand being fucked up by your past. I understand having to take your sister in because your parents are shit. Ultimately though, your FSIL has continuously made choices that make her life worse.

To fight for a better life than the one she was given. To focus on school and getting the fuck out (which thankfully she has). Right now FSIL is spiraling, and maybe you can help her, but she has to want to help herself first. \n\nAdditionally, your fianc\u00e9 needs to stop enabling her bad behavior. She\u2019s not doing her sister or anyone around her any favors. If you can\u2019t get her into therapy, at least try talking to her like a person first. Ask her to explain why she\u2019s doing these things. Ask her if she\u2019s unhappy about moving in with y\u2019all, and why. Also, brace yourself, because she might say some hateful shit to you. Don\u2019t take it personally, based on what limited info we have, I\u2019d be willing to guess that she has animosity towards literally anyone and everyone around her. It\u2019s probably a transference of anger, because she can\u2019t express herself to the people who have actually hurt her. \n\nAsk her what she wants from her future. Does she want to go to college, have a career? If she doesn\u2019t know, tell her that\u2019s okay, and you both are there to help her figure it out\u2026 but she needs to figure her shit out fast. No one else is going to care about her trauma, my sister and I can tell you that from experience. They won\u2019t make excuses for her.

She's better off taking her sister and trying to make it work somewhere else before she herself gets kicked out for touching his action figures the wrong way or whatever.\n\nSometimes life is tough and gives you difficult situations, like your fiancee having to deal with a difficult child with no one to raise her. A good person tries to do the best they can, an asshole throws the problem in the trash and doesn't give a fuck as long as his property is intact, which is what OP is clearly doing.\n\nI'm going to say NAH because it is a legitimately difficult thing to deal with and she needs some discipline which people in their early 20's are going to struggle to provide, but all the N T A people are out of their minds.

I think it would probably feel very different if I were an older sibling instead of a younger one...  it would be hard not to want to be that more mature influence in his life.   For me, as a 14yo watching my 18yo brother go to jail, it didn't feel like there was anything I could do to help or effect anything, and that sense of helplessness is a mercy in a way.\n\nI hope you're doing well, and your brother's future has some bright spots still to come.", "So your suggestion is for him to lock them up, made in response to a comment of his where he describes how they were locked up?", "Yes.  Exactly this.  A troubled teenager needs MORE guidance, MORE intervention, not less.  This is not a good environment for the teenager, let alone OP.", "He\u2019s not her legal guardian. He\u2019s not responsible for getting her into therapy. That falls on the parents or a court designated guardian.", "This completely. I empathize with OP, but everyone is jumping to his side without really considering what the fianc\u00e9e and her sister have gone through.", "I agree with this perspective. Reddit absolutely despises kids, so I\u2019m not surprised at the answers here, but kicking out a traumatized 16 year old who OP agreed to take in is a massive asshole move.", "Thank you Critical_Elephant - I hope we can help save him some major heart ache.", "I'm so disturbed by how many people want to hold a literal child accountable for being traumatized and not learning how to emotionally regulate, when clearly OP hasn't either if he's yelling at a CHILD over broken toys. \n\nI love Lego, I have many valuable things. I know that if I bring a child into my house, they might get broken and that is the risk I accept by agreeing. \n\nOP can leave his fiancee, sure, she's also an adult, but why is everybody taking this out on the poor kid?", "Agreed! If they didn't want the risk associated with bringing in a child, don't bring in a child.", "Listen. If you and your fianc\u00e9 aren\u2019t in the same page about dealing with criminal behavior around you and directed towards you, (and she even blames *you* for becomibg a target in the first place,) then you are never going to be on the same page about anything that matters. I\u2019m not going to tell you what to do with your relationship, but I am going to as you to consider this for what it really is: a dangerous and uncaring partner who sees you suffering and compounds it.", "If the kid is struggling with substances and you\u2019re their guardian? No you shouldn\u2019t have alcohol in the house.\n\n\nThis is why i held off on my vote bc i feel like you\u2019re upset about the situation being hard (which is fair) and your wife may not be doing anything wrong, she just may have more patience in this stressful situation than you. I feel like people really think kids can just be stopped, they can\u2019t. Especially a struggling kid. And if you think you have that much control over your kid, they\u2019re just lying to you or you have an abusive level of control over them. They are autonomous humans with developing brains. They\u2019re HARD. Especially with trauma involved.", "I wouldn't say he \"grew\" out of it...  I would say he always had an idea of where he wanted to be, he just couldn't figure out how to get there for awhile...  his undiagnosed ADHD left him more susceptible to drug abuse than most, but also meant his drug abuse came from a different place than some peoples, and that may have made it easier to get himself out of it than many people.\n\nHe was incredibly lucky, in that he had upper middle class parents who could afford to bail him out of jail immediately on several occasions, which allowed him to keep his jobs.  And a father who was a lawyer and knew who to hire and how to argue to get him lighter sentences...  as well as the inherent bias that judges have toward defendants that have \"stable\" families.  He lived with my parents at various times because my dad knew a judge would be more likely to give him parole sooner if he was returning to his \"family\" home.\n\nHe caught a lucky break from time to time in the form of a couple good people who were his boses, being willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.  He then worked his ass off for some years to prove his worth to those bosses.\n\nHe worked hard, he struggled, he was lucky...  none of it just happened by him getting older.  It happened by him figuring out what worked for him, how to deal with his ADHD without even knowing what it was, etc.\n\nI think saying \"some kids grow out of it\" is the complete wrong idea...  my brother needed a lot of intervention, and he got that, in various ways.  I don't know what would have happened to him if he hadn't been arrested when he was...  and even after that, it took a LOT of effort by himself, my parents, and the judicial system, to get him to a place where he could be \"successful\".\n\nWhich is why I think the situation OP presented is so complicated.  This girl obviously needs intervention...  whether or not OP is the right person to be doing it, or is even capable of doing it is another matter.  I judged my mother harshly on occasion, for enabling my brother, but it had a good end result...  none of us really know exactly where the line between supporting and enabling is until weeks after the choices have to be made...  it seems clear that OP's girlfriend isn't setting enough boundaries or enforcing enough consequences, but we really can't say for sure unless we know a whole lot more than we do...  and there's some pretty basic things that OP could be doing that he hasn't...  like talking to his girlfriend before he yelled at the sister, so the two of them could have discussed her behavior together.  Anyway, this is too long...", "At this point she does have a history and that\u2019s my point is that they shouldn\u2019t be keeping any there until something is figured out", "And how did she knew they there drugs?", "As the older sibling, you feel like you failed your child. They aren't your child and that is the hardest part. At what point do you decide enough is enough. \n\nI don't know how I would react if it were my own children. I have learned a few things because of my brother. He had his own set of problems due to our upbringing that I wasn't qualified to deal with. He would bring his criminal friends by my house and I began to live in fear that they would break into my house and steal from me or show up at my door asking me for whatever money he owed them. I have children and that kind of fear is not fun to live with. In the end, he started blaming me for all the problems in his life. I spent his entire teen and adult life trying to help him stay out of prison and he said I spent his entire life trying to put him in prison. That was my final breaking moment. \n\nI don't know what his future holds. It is up to him to make change. You can provide all the help and support you want, but ultimately it is up to them. \n\nHis son is growing up without him in his life. I am friends with my nephew's mom so I get to see him. He hasn't seen his father in 5 years, he is 6. The last time he saw him, my brother had taken him from his mother and was driving around with him in his car at 1 am, high, and visiting his druggie friends. \n\nSome people can't be saved and as much as we want to help, it isn't our responsibility to keep picking up the pieces. Not saying there is anything wrong with helping people. I believe people should be given chances and help. We all have our limit and usually push past it before we break.", "If locks failed, then it\u2019s irresponsible to keep them in the house at all.

You are also an asshole cause you\u2019re acting like your fianc\u00e9 is equipped. Discipline her sister? How is she gonna know what to do, she probably just as messed up about this but is just handling it \u201cbetter.\u201d\n\nHer sister desperately needs boundaries and does in fact need people who love her unconditionally, y\u2019all are not ready for what you\u2019re facing and are understandably not handling it well. What you all need is therapy and to learn how to communicate because this situation sounds just so impossible.\n\nTake time to consider whether this is actually a situation you want to be in or whether it\u2019s too much for you. But yea, if you decide to stick with it you need to figure out how to regulate your own emotions. You didn\u2019t handle that situation well and you need tools. Good luck", "ESH.\nKid is troubled and acting out. It happens with teenaged kids and she needs therapy. Girlfriend is an enabler. She needs therapy too. \n\nYou? You have the mentality that a troubled kid is a bad kid. I've got 4 kids, 3 with diagnosed autism, 2 of those with oppositional defiant disorder. I've been through the wringer. I've dealt with abuse after abuse from my kids, but I have never considered either of my trouble kids to be bad. The oldest took 20 years, but he learned how to control his impulses. The youngest is still acting out, but is learning control now.

You just say she doesn\u2019t discipline but does she just not discipline your way? How long did you expect years of trauma to take to fix? I just can\u2019t vote without more info. It sounds like a crappy situation that you can absolutely leave if you\u2019re unhappy, even if that means leaving your wife. But i can\u2019t just say who is being an AH in this without knowing specifically how your wife addresses the issues. A traumatized 16 year old struggling behaviorly and those issues not immediately disappearing is not enough reason for me to back you up. It\u2019s a tough situation that sucks to be in for sure, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you are or are not the AH though.
