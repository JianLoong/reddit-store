She and my fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t have the best home life and my fianc\u00e9e was able to come out mostly well adjusted while her sister went in a very different direction.\n\nShe\u2019s a bad kid. I really try to be understanding as I know it\u2019s not 100% on her, but having to deal with her is a nightmare. She skips school frequently, goes out to parties with people she shouldn\u2019t be with, sneaks out, has stolen money from us, is banned from multiple stores for shoplifting. Has stolen weed, alcohol, and psychedelics from us, and countless more things that I don\u2019t have enough characters to list.\n\nThe thing that tops it for me is my fianc\u00e9es behavior toward her. She\u2019s an enabler. She needs discipline her but she refuses to and allows her to walk all over her. I know I\u2019m not her guardian, but she\u2019s living in my house and I don\u2019t want for her to conduct herself this way under my roof. \n\nFriday, she skipped class to go smoke weed with some boy and his parents called the police on them and they brought her to us. I was at my limit with her, and I told her that if she wants to stay here she cannot have the police bringing her home and I was sick and tired of having to be one of the people responsible when she fucks up.\n\nWe got into an argument and my fianc\u00e9e took her to her room to talk to her. Yesterday morning I wake up and go into the living room to start breakfast and I the three Lego sculptures I had made were taken down and threw onto the ground. They were all in pieces. The only way this could\u2019ve happened is if some did it. My fianc\u00e9e had no reason to so I woke up her sister and confronted her.\n\nShe denied it until I said I would just check our security cameras. She confessed and I lost my temper. I told her how much work it was to get her out here to take care of her and how ungrateful she was to us for it. I told her that the disrespect she gives me and her sister who were kind enough to take her in is more than enough reason to Tass her ass on the streets. At this point my fianc\u00e9e came in and her sister started \u201ccrying\u201d saying how I was threatening to throw her out.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e took her side and said I was being an asshole to her as she\u2019s a teenage girl who\u2019s scared and traumatized and she\u2019s acting out because of it. She said my animosity toward her isn\u2019t helping.

You took her in and she doesn't have the wherewithal to not act the fool. She's obviously been enabled, \"trauma\" doesn't mean she's allowed to go get high with boys and act how she wants. Not sure how you've threatened to throw your fiance out but I imagine that relationship isn't going to go far based on this. Her support should be going to her future husband.", "NTA. Did you get a say in your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister moving in? Regardless, you and your fianc\u00e9e need to get on the same page around enforcing boundaries and consequences.", "NTA - Now...I don't think the legos are the issue (at least I hope not). It's more the skipping school, drugs, and so on. ALso, the one thing that bothered me is that you said she has stolen weed and psychadelics from you.  A kid living with you really should not have access to your drug stash..in fact, they shouldn't even know that you have one. \n\nI agree that her behavior is in principle unacceptable and can totally understand your desire to not want to be involved, not want the police coming over, etc. and I believe you are well within your rights to state that if the situation is intolerable, that you don't want to be living in it. However, you should also know that this is your partner's family and taking that stance may result in the end of your relationship and again...please keep your drugs and alcohol somewhere where this kid cannot get to them.", "NtA. Sorry to say but the only way is break up and kick both of them out", "NTA, the sister needs to go to therapy, she needs help, i understand your frustration and you have the right to be frustrated, but she also needs all the help she can get, if left alone i wonder what would become of her.", "NTA.  You've said your piece with no effect.  There is no future for you in this picture.  Maybe you should limit your losses and move on.   Little sister needs professional help, she will soon be an addict, and there is nothing that you are qualified to do that will help her.   Best wishes.", "NTA \n\nThe moment you said she starting stealing from you and your fiance hasn't given her sister any repercussions is already too far. It shouldn't fall to you to be the only person calling out her bad behaviour and your fiance is (as you already said) an enabler of it.\n\nHope you are able to have a discussion together and come to a resolution for you all", "ESH. You handled the situation poorly in my opinion, her behavior sucks but she\u2019s also in a tough enough position. Her behavior is due to her circumstances & being a teenager. Her behavior may even escalate by you threatening to toss her out. The behavior goes more towards the \u201cwhy should I give a f*ck at this point.\u201d Which she\u2019s close enough to anyways. \n\nShe needs some guidance & therapy. You & fianc\u00e9 need to come to a baseline agreement on how to function with her sister. Sister probably feels some guilt & that\u2019s where the enabling comes from. Def a hard position for you to be in.", "Info:   Where would she go if you threw her out?  Who is her legal guardian?", "NTA but you probably need to get rid of both of them since big sis will probably just let her back into the house whenever she wants.", "NTA - There\u2019s no win for you in this situation my friend.  \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 has unilaterally decided that you:\n     CANNOT \u2018re-home\u2019 your future SIL\n     CANNOT discipline or otherwise try to correct       \n      FSIL behavior\n     CANNOT hold FSIL accountable for her behavior\n\nYou CAN, however, end your relationship and you should give that serious thought.   Your fianc\u00e9e has demonstrated that she has no respect for you, you home or your art.", "NTA! Look dude both of them are gonna walk all over you if you don\u2019t put ur foot down.", "Your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s statement was totally fair. You two need a new strategy. I assume she is her sister\u2019s guardian. So it\u2019s on her to call the play and you to help enforce the rules. It definitely sounds like you all need clearer rules. \n\nBut for threatening a kid who\u2019s acting out with abandonment, especially a kid who\u2019s already clearly been abandoned or worse, YTA.", "NTA. You don't have to enable her. Teenagers are old enough to know right from wrong. It's also pretty concerning that she has access to weed, alcohol, and psychedelics in your home. I don't think it's the right environment for her.", "NTA. I had a difficult childhood and was in many ways a \"bad kid\" along the same general lines as the sister.\n\nI have a lot of sympathy for her but don't think you can or should tolerate that behavior. I don't even really like lego sculptures but think someone who will destroy your valuables because you scolded her about a very legitimate incident is someone that you can have in your house.\n\nThese issues are horribly complicated. Sometime every option is bad. Sometimes every option is so bad it is intolerable.\n\nIf you throw her out, who knows what could happen. She seems wild and unrestrained. It is possible she winds up in jail or dies. Your fianc\u00e9 will probably never forgive herself or you for that. But she may alos see the light and recover. I had friends at that age who went to rehabs and did. I had friends who didn't.\n\nBut if you let her stay and if your fianc\u00e9 keeps enabling her she could still wind up in jail or die. She will make your life miserable and it doesn't sound like she is about to grow out of it.\n\nI think putting her out, or at least making it a real option, is probably the right thing to do. But I am not sure your relationship with you fianc\u00e9 will survive it.\n\nI am also not sure there is a third option or a middle path. I am tempted to say that you and the fianc\u00e9 have to agree that she is now on final probation and that any other incidents will have repercussions. The big problem is that I don't know what that would mean. I assume she doesn't have anywhere else to stay.\n\nI feel terrible for her and hope she can turn things around. I eventually did, but I got a bit lucky.\n\nI do know that I would have a lot of trouble living like you are. I do think you are a good person trying to do the right thing. I hope you get the best result. But it isn't really in your control.", "Weed, alcohol and psychedelics do not make a good home life with children or good parenting.  \n\nShe's not a pet rock.  She's a kid that needs intervention, counseling, and real parenting.  ESH   eta clarity", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why is your fianc\u00e9e allowing her to split you? Where are her parents? Also you might need a better hiding place or to just not have weed, psychedelics and alcohol if a child can steal them from you, children's services often take a narrow view of that.", "NTA. I agree with the others that this girl has done unforgivable things. She\u2019s not your responsibility, and your fianc\u00e9e shows a lack of respect for you in making it your responsibility. She has demonstrated that she will prioritize her sister over you every time, even in the wake of such extreme behaviour. She has also demonstrated a lack of common sense in her unwillingness to discipline her sister. If you two end up having children of your own, what kind of co-parent will she make? \n\nBut sometimes it\u2019s not as easy as just leaving when it\u2019s someone you love. You want to marry and build a life with this person or you wouldn\u2019t be engaged. \n\nI have zero issues with responsible weed or psychedelic drug use, but having them around is not doing your family any favours right now. I suggest you stop buying for a while and use that money for some family therapy. Prioritize your FSIL\u2019s mental health obviously, but you and your fianc\u00e9e also need to get on the same team and work out your own issues. At this point something has to give. If that\u2019s a bridge too far and you\u2019re not willing to at least try that, the writing is on the wall and you\u2019re not meant to be with this person.", "Nta but if you marry this woman don't be surprised if you end up raising sil's kid after she jumps bail that your wife paid.", "NTA.

Her sister being \u201ctraumatised\u201d is not a god enough excuse for her to treat you like shit. It\u2019s clear your fianc\u00e9e prioritises her family over you, and I\u2019d be having second thoughts about the relationship because of it.", "NTA but why should you carry the responsibility of their rough upbringing and sign up for a rough rest of your life? Seems like a very unfair arrangement to me..", "NTA\n\nShe's close to becoming an adult and her behavior is unacceptable. She needs some therapy and discipline.", "Grow a pair and kick her out. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour problem isn't the lego sculpture though.  Your problem is you have a law breaking child living with you who you \"can't\" discipline and the other adult \"won't\" discipline.   That won't go well.  Unfortunately, this really has the potential to end your relationship.  Threatening to throw her out is essentially putting your fiance in a \"Me or her\" situation.  I don't blame you one bit.  this sounds like a horrible situation.  But the fact is, you will probably lose if you force her to make this choice.  \n\nAt the same time, you shouldn't have to live like this in your own home. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. Despite what may be good intentions fiance is failing her sister.  The cascade effect of this is that her enabling is going to make her lose OP as well.  Since it's OP's house, stuff, and potentially reputation being destroyed I'd kick them both out.", "If this was a 13 year old I'd say the behavior is reasonable under the circumstances, but if I willingly take in a 16 year old to get her out of her bad situation, and she proceeds to lie, steal, destroy, etc that is ridiculously immature. I understand coming from a bad home and needing therapy but this feels like she specifically has an issue with you. Teenagers get destructive in these scenarios but she didn't say punch a hole in the wall or break dishes or some crap she intentionally broke things that belonged to you. She clearly needs therapy but you and your fiance also need to have a long discussion about how to actually deal with her in a way that will be productive for all parties. NTA", "NTA. Little sis needs to be in some form therapy if she's so \"traumatized\" that she behaves that way, fiancee as well for enabling and not being capable of any discipline towards her. If one or both are not willing to get help for their issues it's time to cut your losses and show both the door.", "NTA But I think you need to have a sit down with your fianc\u00e9 and see where you go from here. This is not sustainable. I feel for all of you, including the sister. But this is not the life you signed up for and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister needs counseling at minimum.", "NTA - at least now you see your fianc\u00e9 as she really is. Your SIL doesn't deserve your help as she's  spoilled brat. You gave her a chance to live a comfy life but she still choose a shitty life. Not your kid, not your problem. Yeet her asap", "ESH. That kid's parents have failed her, she is spinning out of control,  and you two do not sound like you're mature enough to guide her away from her self destructive path. She has stolen your weed and psychedelics.  Need I say more?", "Nta. My dogs don\u2019t even do that so if they can handle themselves a conscious human can too. No manners at 16? Yeah if the gf doesn\u2019t set boundaries with her asap she\u2019d be single too. Means she\u2019ll always put her birth family before her partner", "NTA.  when someone disrespect you in your own home then thats it. she is not your monkey and she is not your circus.\n\nTo be honest to say that you don't have your future sister in law problem, you have fianc\u00e9 problem. Staying under your roof doesn't mean you are her responsible. do you know who is responsible for that girl you fianc\u00e9!\n\nTalk to your Fianc\u00e9 and create boundaries no more drama!", "OP & fianc\u00e9 need guidance also.  I have to imagine that they knew about the problem behavior before taking the 16yo in.  Removing someone from the original cause of problem behavior does not result in a change to the behavior.  \n\nThis is going to be a long slog; marked by two steps forward and one step back type of progress.  Only if the two adults in the situation have their act together.", "This is the sad but true reality of the situation.\n\nYounger sister is toxic. There might very well be good reasons why she is the way she is, but that doesn't change the fact that she will absolutely not allow this home to be a healthy environment. She doesn't recognize any authority there and worse, she is focusing on revenge (purposely looking for ways to hurt OP).  That absolutely needs to be removed from the household.\n\nFiancee is well-meaning but incapable of dealing with sister. That was already pretty clear from OP's description, this just underscores that it absolutely will not get better if things continue.\n\nOP's anger/frustration is understandable given the circumstances, but fiancee is right that it is not helping the situation. But what's the solution? Pretending not to be angry and frustrated at someone like this who is actively making your life worse? No, that just lets it fester.\n\nOP is NTA here, and continuing on as if there is some magical happy ending just around the corner is not healthy for anyone. Things must change. Sister must go. Maybe fiancee needs to go with her?", "The rules seem pretty simple... \"stop doing illegal shit\". I'm surprised they havent already thrown out the little criminal. NTA", "This is so true. I grw up in a small town and had a sister that was similar.  Coos had to being her home all the time. We eventually became that house.  The cops in town even had a nick name for my sister. Your 100 percent right that his reputation could be tarnished because of this. He Def needs to get that child out of the house and I would tell the fiance either her sister goes or they both go but he cannot keep doing this.", "Totally agree. Maybe family therapy alongside individual therapy. But like you said, the adults need to get their act together asap or else nothing is going to change & will likely get worse.", "But those clearly aren\u2019t the rules. OP clearly has drugs around for the kid to steal, which is illegal and might be considered child endangerment, while breaking a Lego sculpture isn\u2019t criminal in most places, despite being the thing OP wants to enforce on.", "Family therapy probably won't hurt, but is like spitting on a house fire. No therapist in the world can solve a problem like this. Been there."]}
