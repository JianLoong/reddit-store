I really like him, and although we're not \"official\", we are dating exclusively. \n\nHe is going on a week long hiking trip in a very remote area. It's about 50miles or 80km, an advance route. Here's the kicker, he's never hiked before. Not even a day hike.\n\nI, on the other hand, have a long history of hiking and camping out. I offered to help him prep for it and he gladly accepted. \n\nI mean I literally packed his hiking bag, wrote down local emergency numbers, how to get to escape routes, got him survival  ect. He didn't have to lift a finger.\n\nI had to uber back and forth for equipment. He has a car but doesn't like traffic. I've been staying at his place for most of the week for his prep.\n\nFriday morning my mom called to say that my had another stroke and is hooked up to a machine. He's going to get heart surgery Monday.\n\nI've been crying the entire day. Luckily, my houemate (Emma) said that she's traveling and offered to lift me to my dad and back for the weekend (Emma wants to leave on Friday night). I don't have a car, only a motorcycle (money is tight sometimes)\n\nI called Mike and let him know. I reassured him that I'll still come over to help him pack his final things, but I'll be going home with Emma that night. \n\nThe plan was I leave work at 2pm, head over to Mike's to help him with packing his backpack. And then we leave for my hometown at 8pm. (It's a 2 hour drive).\n\nMike has been asking me all day to stay the night because it will be our last night together before the hike. And then I can go with him because he'll be passing by my home town on Saturday morning.\n\nI appreciated the offer but declined. He couldn't understand why because if I see my dad so late at night I'm just gonna go to bed afterwards. \n\nBut have literally been crying all day. I don't know what to expect when I see him. When he had his first stroke, his appearance changed. I want the night to process things. Mike didn't seem to understand this.\n\n I went over to help him pack. But later at night, my body started aching really bad and I sort of broke down. I didn't want to say goodbye to Mike, and I was scared of seeing my dad. \n\nI asked him if he'd please drop me off at home and have one last coffee with me while I wait for Emma, instead of me going alone and being alone in my current state. \n\nHe doubled down saying that the solution is to stay with him & have fun, go ice skating and roadtrip with him the next morning. I tried explaining that I can't postpone seeing my dad.\n\nWe went back and forth a bit, and he said that me crying makes him look like the bad guy. I told him he's being selfish because after everything I've done it's a small ask for him to spend 10 minutes with me while I wait for Emma.\n\nI ended up calling an uber and now I don't know if I over reacted.

Is he completely self absorbed or has zero empathy?  I wouldn\u2019t have loaned him any of my equipment either.  Backpacking gear is expensive and he sounds like one of those people that will lose it or destroy it because he is that ignorant.  If it was me, I\u2019d dump him over this.  I lost a parent around his age and every one of my friends rallied around me.  I can\u2019t imagine my SO not being there for me.", "NTA. Hate to break it to you but Mike is not a good guy. At best he is  way way way to selfish and immature at worst this is a major Narcacism redflag. All he cares about is what is fun and convinient for him. He does not care about how you feel beyond how it it benefits him. Put your energy towards people who need and appreciate it.", "NTA. Your father is in a very serious way. If I was Mike I'd strongly consider cancelling/postponing the hike to support you. Be with your father and take care of yourself and your family.", "NTA. don't even feel like you should have been ubering for the equipment. be with your family, dont use this time on this a hole", "This guy doesn\u2019t actually care about you. If he did, he\u2019d be far more concerned about making sure you were okay than about getting his own way. \n\nYou spent a ton of time helping him, and he couldn\u2019t even do the bare minimum for you in your time of need. \n\nHe\u2019s selfish and immature. I hope you see this as the GIANT red flag it is and leave him. \n\nNTA.", "NTA your dad had a serious health episode he however is a selfish self centered non empathetic asshole leave this man it\u2019s not a huge ask after spending all that time with him helping him for 10 minutes I hope this idiot gets lost on his hike and becomes fertilizer who goes on a multi day hike with no experience whatsoever sounds suicidal", "It sounds like Mike has maturity and empathy deficiencies. Your requests were reasonable. NTA.\n\nBut it is worth you noting personally that Mike is nurturing his helpless streak, and his user streak. I suggest proceeding with caution in this relationship because he does not have your back.", "NTA. I don't get how he wants you to have fun when you're dealing with a family emergency. I hope you realize he's not boyfriend quality.", "Dude.. Is Mike even human? NTA. Please consider ending it", "NTA. Mike either has never experienced family in serious conditions or this is a huge red flag in him purposely trying to delay you from seeing your father because Mike's own needs come first to Mike. Someone with the slightest empathy would want you to get to your dad as soon as possible. Just putting that out there. I do hope for the best for your father and his surgery.", "NTA and I'm so so sorry for what you and your family are going through.\n\ndrop this asshole like a hot potato\n\nwhat a selfish, inconsiderate, immature, morally bankrupt baby-child.", "NTA. Of course you should be going to see your father. \n\nHe\u2019s TA for not helping you get there.", "NTA. What is that lack of empathy from your friend?", "Just say someone who likes you! He doesn\u2019t. Want better for yourself or YTA", "NTA. The red flag is waving itself", "NTA. It's your father you're concerned about, getting heart surgery no less! That's a very serious and emotional thing.\n\nMike seems aloof and unempathetic. I think at 24 he's probably just not mature, perhaps hasn't had to deal with much heartache or loss in his life, so can't relate to your situation, though as I type that I realize you don't necessarily have to go through something awful to empathize with someone else's pain for their parent.", "Your BF seems like a narcissistoc asshole. There is no empathy here, just what works for him and what he wants.\n\nNTA, but you deserve better.", "You dodged a bullet. Keep dodging him.", "Sorry about your dad, hope he\u2019s ok.  You gotta out your family first.  Ok not saying this dude is a total life if shit buys a small favor, given the circumstances.\n\nSo it could be two things.  He can\u2019t be trusted in the future to help when you need it.  Or he just wants to spend time with you and thought you could use the company.

How can you like someone who's so selfish and doesn't show you an ounce of care? Get your head out of your ass. This guy is a massive ahole. \n\nMy friends would be doing everything in their power to help and support me. My boyfriend would be greatly upset and only think of how to help me and stick to my side during such a difficult time. \n\nYour bf can't even be bothered to give you a lift. Like, seriously. Idk if you're used to people treating you like dirt so you think this is normal, but literal strangers would be nicer to you than your bf is being.\n\nNTA but open your eyes. This guy isn't worth dating.", "NTA.  Time to tell Mike to \"get lost\" literally and figuratively.  Could just happen to an inexperienced hiker doing a difficult hike!!  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope your dad comes good!!", "NTA. Dump him immediately. You can\u2019t change a person with no empathy.", "NTA, i would've dumped him over the going back and forth using ubers to get his supplies cause he doesn't like traffic. No one likes traffic but he has a car he should be getting the supplies. And that's not even discussing the fact that he refused to take you home and spend 10 minutes drinking coffee while waiting for your friend. Fuck that guy", "Gently, he's not that into you and you're investing more in him than he is you.\n\nYou're NTA, but you also don't know your worth. I hope your dad is OK.", "NTA!!! Your boyfriend, who should become an ex-boyfriend if he hasn't already, is the giant asshole here.", "Right? NTA but this guy Mike absolutely is. Selfish is one of the nicest things you can say about him based on your post. A decent guy would have postponed his hike and driven you straight to see your dad. You Uber'd back and forth instead of him using his car because he doesn't like traffic-what the ever-loving fuck??\n\nPlease, please grow a spine and dump this twunt. Spend time with your mom and dad and forget Mike exists.", "He'll get a few miles in, and quit is my guess. But yeah, he sounds like an idiot but he's also using her as well. I do, however, share your enthusiasm for him getting lost on his hike and being part of the ecosystem."]}
