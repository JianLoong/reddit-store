Unfortunately we had some health issues concerning my girlfriend's pregnancy, even though she was 31 weeks pregnant just a few days before thanksgiving, she had to have an emergency C-section. I won't go into too much detail with that since it's irrelevant, but the thing is that we cancelled dinner, my gf and our baby had to be in the hospital for a bit. \n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to just stay home during Christmas and new year's eve dinner too, as she was still recovering from the surgery and we honestly didn't feel like doing much. However, since she's feeling better now she thought that it would be a good idea to have a family dinner now, to make up for all of our missed holidays this year. \n\nLong story short, we planned a dinner for yesterday. My girlfriend and I are vegan, usually she doesn't mind too much being around cooked meat, but we prefer to not have it in our home. My sister (f35) is married and has two kids (both boys under 10). \n\nMy girlfriend and I cooked for everyone, and when our families came, my sister's husband asked where the real food was after we told them what we've cooked (all vegan dishes). My gf is a little oversensitive still, so I took my family aside and kindly asked them to not make any harsh comments like that. They said they'll be careful and my sister's husband apologised. \n\nHowever, as I was finishing cooking some of our food, someone rang the bell. My sister said \"oh, it must be the delivery for the kids\" and yeah, it was. She had ordered fried chicken for her kids since they surely won't like what my gf and I cooked. That caused a big argument between me and my sister, since she didn't tell me that she was ordering chicken (which I wouldn't have allowed). The discussion escalated and I ended up asking my sister and her family to leave, after that my parents also got upset with me and they left as well. We ended up having dinner just with my in-laws and my brother.\n\nI feel like I did something wrong because now my parents or sister don't want to talk to me unless I apologize for \"being an extremist\", but I was only trying to keep my girlfriend comfortable and happy in her own house?

I'm a happy omnivore and love me some good fried chicken, but when I go visit my vegan aunt I don't order KFC to her house. And yes, I have a small child under ten, I'm aware of what they prefer to eat. Guess what he eats when we visit my aunt? Vegan food. Vegetables are good for him, and if he's really not having it we can hit up a drive through on the way home. Oh, the horror of not having meat for *one meal*!\n\nIt is so, so easy to be decent guests by just respecting the house rules of the people you are visiting. If you can't handle that, then don't visit them. Simple. Unless you and your gf spontaneously became vegans last week without telling anybody, your dinner party fare should have been no surprise and their ill-manners were uncalled for.", "WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BABY????", "NTA\n\nPeople can eat vegan for ONE meal. You do NOT go to someone's house as a guest, criticise and insult them. And bring good into that home without permission that you know they don't eat. If her sons' had tried it and disliked it, they could have asked to order something else. Or, they could have fed them after. But their behaviour was rude fron start to finish.", "NTA. Anyone who orders a takeaway to their dinner host's home is automatically a rude ahole. Her children need to know that they won't love every meal they're served, but they should at least give it a taste. If they really didn't enjoy it, she could have taken them for a takeaway later. Your BIL needs a lesson in manners as well.", "NTA. If I'm going to a vegans house for a dinner I don't expect to have meat or dairy for that dinner. I have 2 kids under 10, I know how picky they can be and if I knew they'd have a problem eating vegan I'd either leave them at home with someone else, or bring some safe snacks for them to have in the car before hand so they wouldn't go hungry.\n\n\nI absolutely would not under any circumstances order take away food for my children to eat without first trying to get the kids to eat what had been made, and I definitely would be asking the host if its okay to order something in. If not then I'd excuse myself and leave the dinner so I could get my kids fed.\n\n\nThere was a way to handle this as a parent and what they did was not it. Yes, the kids can't understand the complexity of the situation and it isn't their fault, their parents however can and they had options beforehand to avoid this mess.\n\n\nCould you have communicated better that it was an all vegan meal? Yes. However they also could have asked, or heck, applied common sense to this \"huh, our hosts are both vegan, this will likely mean the food will be vegan, should we feed the kids before we go? Or get a sitter maybe?\" it's really not that hard.", "NTA.\n\nUnless your girlfriend became vegan the night of the party everyone was aware you and your girlfriend were vegan. When one is invited into a vegan home the assumption should be the meal will be meat and dairy free. \n\nIt\u2019s also extremely rude to bring food into a home with known food restrictions. That doesn\u2019t change for vegan homes.\n\nYour sister\u2019s family may not be vegan but they are omnivores. Everything you served was something they could eat. \n\nIt\u2019s not like vegan food is just iceberg lettuce and raw oats. Tempura can be vegan. Pad Thai can be vegan. Plus they make vegan substitutes now for every meat and dairy product under the sun. People are out here snacking on vegan beef taquitos and dipping them in vegan nacho cheese.\n\nEven if they didn\u2019t enjoy the meal one night of bread and salad or pb&j sandwiches wouldn\u2019t harm anyone. \n\nPlus, you served them French fries. Who can\u2019t make a meal out of French fries?", "NTA.  People can go one meal without eating meat.  From one of your replies it sounds like you made vegan nuggets and fries for the kids that weren't even given a chance.  People like to make fun of vegans/vegetarians but when it comes to the prospect of having one meatless meal, omnivores are the biggest crybabies on the planet.", "I don't offer a verdict either way but I think maybe something was lost in translation. The ordered door was specifically for the *kids* implying that mom and dad would have eaten the vegan food offered to them..You said there were vegan nuggets and fries for the kids..did anyone think to mention that to their parents? Maybe I'm weird but after absorbing that it was a vegan dinner if I (if I were their mom) heard that there were vegan nuggets I would've at least given it a shot..I was brought up to never saw eww but to say no thank you if I tried something I didn't like eating as a guest, then other arrangements could have been made to feed the kids..but it seems they were just trying to placate the kids and ensure they ate and were kicked out for it.", "This is probably gonna get downvoted to hell, but I have to ask.  How come omnivores are generally expected to make at least 1 vegan dish if a vegan is coming to a meal, but vegans aren\u2019t expected to make something with meat when making a meal for non-vegans?  No judgement either way, just curious", "INFO if their kids had tried your vegan food and refused to eat it would you still have made such a fuss about them ordering something the kids would eat? Either way your sister\u2019s an asshole for not even trying, but if you would have she\u2019s right to say you\u2019re an extremist.", "NTA. You might have warned people that no meat was included, but they know you are vegan. If it was a problem, they could have eaten what you provided and picked up some nuggets on the way home. Missing meat for one meal won't kill them. They also should have realized that your girlfriend was in a tender state and behaved better.", "NTA. They know you're vegans so should've fed the kids chicken before coming over", "I\u2019m not vegan, am a huge carnivore, but would never in a million years think it was acceptable to bring meat into a vegetarian or vegan home!  Your sister is a major AH; rude, inconsiderate and disrespectful.  They owe YOU an apology.  NTA, and I beg you not to apologize to them; you don\u2019t owe them one.", "NTA. Your house, your rules.\n\nPlease, though, be aware that (while your sister most likely does not fit into this category) there are many people, who, due to specific diseases/conditions/allergies, cannot consume most items that make up a vegan meal. These items can be beans, legumes, soy, cruciferous vegetables, nuts, seeds, lettuce, onions, garlic, and \u201cskin\u201d vegetables. Just to name a few.\n\nThe virtue superiority of speaking of one\u2019s ethics over veganism is a form of ableist behavior. People cannot help some things, and they must obtain nutrition in whatever form they can.\n\nHappy returns and much health to you and your family.", "NTA. Who the frick orders in food when invited to a dinner at someone's house because the menu isn't their favorite?! I had an aunt (divorced from my uncle now) who was a HORRIBLE cook. We would eat her burned to a crisp hot dogs and super sour apple pie and be polite during the dinner. Yeah, we normally ate something else afterwards or had a big lunch but we had some damn manners. \n\nAnd it's not being an extremist to not have meat at one damn meal. If they can't go without meat for one meal then that's their problem, not yours.", "People can go without meat at a singular meal. NTA.", "NTA... \n\nHowever, it doesn't sound like you made it clear to them before-hand that meat would not be allowed in the house; which you really should've done. If you guys don't usually mind being around meat I can see why they might just assume getting something just for the kids wouldn't have been a big deal, but they still should have asked you. \n\nThis just seems like a whole lot of a lack of communication on both sides that could've been a conversation when you invited them, not as dinner was getting ready to be served. But your sister and her family made far too many assumptions on how they'd be accommodated that were a bit boned-headed.. Like assuming the vegan household would just make a meat dish as long an meat-eaters were coming to dinner. \n\nAlso.... younger kids can be really sensitive to new smells/tastes/textures to an extent where a food that is foreign to them really is almost inedible to their still developing and more sensitive sense of taste. I can understand why a parent would want them to have a food they'd reliably eat on hand rather than force them to try something new and risk them reacting poorly. And a kid under 10 is far more likely to be vocal or visual in their displeasure in a food they don't like without meaning to be rude. If she really got it *just for the kids* she was making her best effort at a compromise that she thought would keep the peace. A poorly conceived effort, but not with bad intention.", "NTA but a couple notes: You and your gf did a very nice thing to cook for everyone. However, unless they are used to your meals being completely vegan even for guests, you really should have given them a heads up. It's honestly just good practice to let people coming to your home know what you're cooking ahead of time anyway.\n\nThat way they could have chosen to feed their kids something before coming, or they could have planned to grab some in-n-out on the way home...or at the very least they could have prepared the kids with a little pep talk about kindly eating what you're offered. (Sounds like they may not even be able to do that themselves....but one could hope!).\n\nThey were completely out of line to order food to your house when you'd cooked without checking with you first though. That was ridiculous and they're just teaching their kids to be disrespectful.", "NTA. Who the H orders food at someone dinner party! So rude and immature they can't eat one vegan meal, and this is coming from an omnivore/carnivore. This is how entitled people have become.\n\nThey owe you an apology.", "**You are not and extremist - your sister is a troublemaker for not asking first and understanding or respecting the house rules.** When invited you eat what is served and if it is not adequate for you then you can eat at home later... you are NTA", "YTA. It's nice of you to think of your gf but when you host dinner you have to think about what others like as well. For example  in a non vegan food arrangement you would want people to respect your wishes and preferences and give you Vegan options. They invited you, it is their responsibility but just like that you knew your family isn't vegan so you should have kept some options (just like ordered it) or given them a warning. There's no need to force everyone to eat Vegan because you are Vegan. Just like there no need for anyone to force you to eat meat just because they eat it or prefer it. Some sort of arrangement should have been made or they should have been warned so they know whats gonna happen", "I swear, I'm not sure what happened the last few years but people have seriously lost their minds & whatever little common sense they may have had. I was raised to believe that if I was invited to dinner at someone's house, I ate what I was served (barring allergies of course) and to be gracious & thankful about it. Even if I didn't like it, I ate it & was thankful someone took time to cook & share it with me. Good lord, this broad missed that lesson...", "YTA- Isn\u2019t it funny how everyone gets all pissy when people don\u2019t want to accommodate vegans preferences but not the other way around. I\u2019m all for plant based diets but serving food like products, I.e. \u201cvegan nuggets\u201d, is not something I would eat. I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t the issue since the OP says the kids live off McDonald\u2019s, but it seems they didn\u2019t even warn people coming that it would be an all vegan menu. I can\u2019t eat soy or corn and most vegan options are just that, so I would have either brought my own food or respectfully declined. Not to mention children are picky and vegan nuggets definitely do not taste anything like what the children are used to.", "NTA. Your sister probably knows you guys are vegan and that you don\u2019t like cooked meat in your own house house. Then she decides to order fried chicken for the kids. Really?", "YTA. These are kids. What kids want vegan food??? And to kick your sister out because she ordered fried chicken for the \u201ckids\u201d was extreme. I def think she\u2019s owed an apology.", "I\u2019m wondering.. and this is for all the commenters too and OP who it maybe didn\u2019t occur to, what if she ordered the chicken to save your GF\u2019s feelings? You pulled them aside and said you would prefer no comments on the food or anything that could be upsetting (not the asshole for that at all) so maybe your sister preemptively ordered food to avoid her kids saying \u201cew this is gross\u201d \u201cthis doesn\u2019t taste normal\u201d \u201cI want McDonald\u2019s this sucks\u201d (my niece is a huge offender for that last one at 8 so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised). \n\nI think maybe you\u2019ve just miscommunicated and after months of stress of course that can happen, but you do maybe owe her an apology and conversation to clear it up, because it sounds like the timeline is: you told them what was for dinner, brother in law made a rude comment, you pull the aside and politely ask that they refrain from judging the food and the house or anything else because your family is emotionally frayed from postpartum stress, you sister quietly ordered the children food so as not to make a scene and avoid the kids upsetting your girlfriend in case they didn\u2019t like the food because kids are kids with kid filters. If that\u2019s the case I think you might be the AH a little bit.", "YTA. Simply because as you stated, normally meat is fine in your home. They didn\u2019t insist you provide their kids preferred food, they discretely ordered it for their kids only. Kids are ridiculously picky. Yes they can eat a vegan meal , but what is the vegan meal ? Soy isn\u2019t actually healthy for kids and can cause puberty to happen early and other health conditions . \n\nIf you had always kept a strictly no meat house then they would have known to pre feed their kids. I\u2019d consider that bridge burnt at least for awhile. \n\nBeing a parent means being gracious to other parents for how they choose to feed and care for their own children. If that\u2019s how you guys are going to treat other parents, good luck building friendships. They saw the food and knew their kids won\u2019t touch it. After driving out to see you with kids in tow, I\u2019d be extremely irritated at being kicked out and go low communication for awhile. Way to foster a great relationship between cousins.", "YTA. You kicked kids out for not trying your fake nuggets. That's the bottom line. I don't care what your girlfriend thinks, or how sensitive she is. Just think about how sensitive she will be when you go over to your sisters house and they don't have anything vegan for your kid? What if they say just try the meat nuggets? What if they said they don't allow vegan cuisine in their home just to be petty?", "NTA. Went to a vegan dinner once at a friend's home and have to admit it wasn't very good at all. But, a couple of  years later, my wife received gift coupons for a Vegan restaurant so we gave it a shot. It was actually very enjoyable. Long story short, it's the chef that makes all the difference. You just have to keep an open mind. And no, I still like meat but I make much more effort in preparation of veggies now.", "YTA for making vegan food for people who aren\u2019t vegan. You didn\u2019t tell them, and then you went to the meanest point.", "Was the Thanksgiving meal you were going to host going to be an entirely vegan menu as well? As it always been vegan meals for friends and family when you're entertaining? Just need some context.", "NTA. But I do have a question. You said in a comment that you hadn\u2019t told them you wouldn\u2019t be serving meat. For a regular dinner, I don\u2019t see that as a big problem. However, the original plan was for you to host Thanksgiving. Had you told them there would be no meat then also? \n\nBecause I think a meat-free Thanksgiving is something that should be mentioned since it\u2019s not traditional & most people would be reasonably expecting turkey, etc. You certainly don\u2019t have to ever cook meat in your own home if you choose not to, but for a holiday like Thanksgiving, I think it should be made very clear that there would be no meat. (I say this as someone who very rarely eats or serves meat.)\n\nAgain, that\u2019s just a question to satisfy my own curiosity. Re the dinner you mentioned, your sister was rude and awful. And she missed a good parenting opportunity too. I think you were justified in being so angry.\n\nCongratulations on the new baby!", "ESH you should have let the parents know in advance. There\u2019s nothing wrong with them making alternate arrangements for their kids. They know their kids better than us. \n\nAlso, while it may not apply here- just noting for awareness that some of us are sensitive to certain products commonly used in vegan food \u2014 for example, soy. If I have soy, I will have an endometriosis flare up.", "I'm on the fence between no AHs and everybody is.\n\nYou're allowed to have a vegan home, but it sounds like you don't exclusively host vegan meals and didn't let the parents of a two under-10 kids know you would be serving vegan food. Perhaps they should have assumed, but you definitely should have let them know.  But I kind of want to let you, and especially your GF, off the hook because new baby after emergency c-section and hospitalization. \n\nWhat BIL said wasn't cool, but he apologized when called on it, so I'm not going to be too mad at him.\n\nYou should always ask before ordering food to somebody else's house, so Sister isn't cool even if she didn't know for sure you wouldn't be okay with it.\n\nYour parents shouldn't be encouraging this conflict.\n\nI'll go with ESH.", "I'm going with ESH, but it's mostly based on my style of hosting.  If I'm inviting people over to my home,  they are my guests and my goal isn't to make them conform to my standards of eating,  it's to make sure they enjoy their meal and time together. \n\nThat being said,  when I'm a guest I will absolutely respect the rules of the home I'm visiting and I will honestly pretend to enjoy food I absolutely hate because I appreciate the time someone put into making it \n\nYou're not an AH for keeping Vegan in your home.  They're not AH for not wanting to eat Vegan.  You're all AHs for not taking dietary preference into account. If you're inviting \"serious\" (as in,  unbending) non Vegans into your home for dinner,  then you should know the Vegan version of meat options is not an acceptable solution.  I love veggies all day long,  but soy chicken in no way tastes close to actual chicken - which is a positive on your end,  but a negative for the people you specifically invited over for the express purpose of providing them food. \n\nThat being said,  they are also AH because I'm assuming they knew they were visiting a Vegan household,  but incorrectly assumed that the food would not be all Vegan.  I don't know if the menu was explicitly stated in advance to be all Vegan,  but I think common sense should probably dictate it was very likely.  For them to act all shocked and order in meat dishes without even trying the food provided is therefore rude.  \n\nHonestly,  I think this is a case of your dietary preference preventing you from being an accommodating host,  combined with your family also being very poor guests.", "Soft YTA. Kids are picky eaters. She ordered some fried chicken so they wouldn\u2019t make a scene. Then you went and made a scene. Did you inform your sister that you\u2019d be cooking an all vegan meal? Sounded like her and her husband where ok with it, just thinking of there kids. She also could\u2019ve cleared it with you but she didn\u2019t and you blew it up.", "YTA.  Fake meat products are ultra processed crap.  That\u2019s why Beyond Meat sales have fallen 30%.

YTA.", "INFO: You open your post that you were originally going to host Thanksgiving last year for the same group? Would this have been all vegan also and if so were they aware? Or would you have planned for the standard meal options including meat? \n\nNTA considering what your girlfriend has been through, but I can potentially see a communication issue around what is and isn't tolerated within your household.", "You're kinda TA. Most of this could've been avoided by prefacing that you'd only be serving vegan dishes ahead of time. It's generally polite to inform your guest of the kind of food you're serving beforehand, regardless if its vegan or not. Sure, your guests ordering takeout to your door is also kind of a dick move, but the average under 10yo basically runs on chicken. That's probably the better alternative than forcing their kids to eat the vegan food and risk them throwing a fit or insulting your wife's cooking directly. But they should've asked before ordering. Kicking them out would've been more understandable if they refused your food and ordered takeout for themselves as well, but only doing it for the kids is more understandable. Everyone's reaction was a bit much, but kicking them out instead of having an adult conversation makes you more of TA", "NTA but never invite your sister for anything in your home again. She doesn't respect you, your GF, nor your home. And she demonstrated horrible manners for her children to learn. Let your parents host her moving forward.", "NTA.

That is the rudest thing I've heard in a while, if that happened to me, they would have been kicked out immediately and never be welcome back!", "A lot of missing context that makes this hard to judge. You definitely should have let everyone know this was going to be a no meat meal, unless they know you\u2019re vegan and you felt they should have assumed so? Would have been better to set those expectations. I see a lot of people asking why the kids couldn\u2019t have just had vegetables. It\u2019s really easy to say that but if we\u2019re sitting down at a family member\u2019s home and I\u2019m going to have an hours long enjoyable meal, I\u2019ll want my kids to have a nice long full meal too. So just vegetables wasn\u2019t going to be enough for some hungry kids. I do see that you made them French fries and veggie nuggets which is very thoughtful of you. But did your sister know those were available? Did the two of you have a real conversation at any point before she went and ordered take out without asking and you told her to get out? \n\nI was a picky eater and most of it was a fear/anxiety response that I wasn\u2019t able to overcome until adulthood. I would not have felt safe trying brand new vegan foods at someone else\u2019s house, happily decided I liked it and enjoyed the whole meal. Anyone expecting that outcome isn\u2019t being realistic about kids.\n\nWhat\u2019s your relationship like with your sister? She\u2019s at a different stage of parenting than you where ordering some takeout during a meal she knows the kids won\u2019t enjoy isn\u2019t a big deal and perhaps she didn\u2019t think it would be rude at her brother\u2019s house. If my sister made a huge vegan meal for dinner she would be dialling Uber Eats herself for my youngest knowing he wasn\u2019t going to be able to touch any of it. That would be no big deal between us but I don\u2019t know the relationship between the two of you.\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong for making a vegan meal. She\u2019s not wrong for wanting to make sure her kids have something they can safely enjoy without having to spend half the mealtime trying to convince them to try vegan nuggets \u201cI promise it tastes the same!\u201d\n\nSome questions, and some patience and kindness could have gone a long way here.

I am a meat eater, but  the conflict between meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans is well known. Some on each side do go to extremes. But it sounds like the only extremeist is your sister for disrespecting you and your girlfriend in your home over meat. And your parents for being ridiculous. \n\nYou live a vegan lifestyle. You sound like you are not pushy with your lifestyle at all. It is well known that non meat eaters prefer not to smell meat. To me, it's a given not to bring the smell of cooked meat food of any kind into the home of non meat eaters. It's hugely disrespectful, at the least. The smell of cooked meat lasts for quite a while. You have the right not to want it in your home. Your sister was very disrespectful of you both.", "Were the guests informed you were serving vegan when they were invited?

Unfortunately we had some health issues concerning my girlfriend's pregnancy, even though she was 31 weeks pregnant just a few days before thanksgiving, she had to have an emergency C-section. I won't go into too much detail with that since it's irrelevant, but the thing is that we cancelled dinner, my gf and our baby had to be in the hospital for a bit. \n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to just stay home during Christmas and new year's eve dinner too, as she was still recovering from the surgery and we honestly didn't feel like doing much. However, since she's feeling better now she thought that it would be a good idea to have a family dinner now, to make up for all of our missed holidays this year. \n\nLong story short, we planned a dinner for yesterday. My girlfriend and I are vegan, usually she doesn't mind too much being around cooked meat, but we prefer to not have it in our home. My sister (f35) is married and has two kids (both boys under 10). \n\nMy girlfriend and I cooked for everyone, and when our families came, my sister's husband asked where the real food was after we told them what we've cooked (all vegan dishes). My gf is a little oversensitive still, so I took my family aside and kindly asked them to not make any harsh comments like that.

There is not a picky eater in the bunch. \n\n A child should have the option of not having to eat something they don\u2019t like. Often children are \u201cpicky\u201d because not eating is one of the first things that they are able to control.

I understand it\u2019s your home but if you are choosing to host you should be accommodating your guests as well. \n\nIf I am making a pork dish I know that certain family members don\u2019t eat pork so I will make another meat dish. I have in laws that don\u2019t eat meat so I will also make a vegetarian dish. This all comes with hosting people in your home. I make sure that I have meals, desserts and drinks that everyone will like. \n\nThis morbid idea that it\u2019s your home your rules, why would you ever choose to host anyone then? Why would you host knowing other people aren\u2019t vegan and you don\u2019t want meat cooked in your home? No you shouldn\u2019t be hosting if you aren\u2019t going to provide other options for people or tell them ahead of time so that they can decide if they want to come or not. \n\nCongrats on the new baby and I wish nothing but healing for your girlfriend. However a difficult labor and being sensitive does not mean other people have to tip toe around her feelings. \n\nYou should have planned better and been honest with your family, especially since children would be there regarding what you were providing for dinner.", "I hadn't seen OP's comment about fries and vegan nuggets (which I personally love) for the children when I posted.

I thought my (vegetarian) food should be fine for the young kids, and in other circumstances it probably would have been. But at a dinner party, which is already very taxing on kids who don't usually attend dinner parties, adding additional new experiences (such as things that look like but aren't the same as chicken nuggets) can cause young children to become overwhelmed and that becomes everyone's problem.\n\nOP's sister did her best.

So we have a defensive communicator vs. inconsiderate family members - it's a shitshow. \n\nUltimately, these family members need to be more respectful of all of each other's boundaries and realize that it's okay to have preferences as long as we can openly communicate and have acceptance. I happily host nonvegan and vegan parties at least once a month with no complaints - just comes down to communication. \n\nAs someone who hosts a lot of parties, I would personally recommend OP have more nonvegan food as this current arrangement is not harmonious.", "I personally don\u2019t like much by way of vegan equivalent and many vegetables have too much sugar in them which can cause severe stomach pain.

You have every right. But don't accept dinner invitations from people who aren't privy to your personal list of approved foods.
