I can\u2019t imagine it woulda went over well without her and her husbands approval before.", "NTA, he made your wedding about him.", "I\u2019d go no contact for a bit after that honestly what an ass he is", "For your brother and sil hire a belly dancer or male stripper. That would be a great addition to a baby shower or housewarming party or graduation. Steal one of their moments and say well isn\u2019t this our thing? You had no problem causing a scene at my wedding, why would you care that a male stripper has his ass in your wife\u2019s face during her baby shower?", " NTA and I\u2019d go LC with your family for awhile. If they ask, tell them the truth. Your brother made a joke out of your expensive wedding and they supported him instead of pushing him off.", "You should have made him walk the plank...at swordpoint.", "He\u2019s generally a rude person. Likes to take purposefully unflattering photos and then put them on Facebook. When you ask him to take them down he says \u201cI can\u2019t help that\u2019s how you look.\u201d This is just one of his many \u201cquirks\u201d that everyone indulges", "Whats LC? I\u2019ve gone NC with everyone but one sister, who I kind of do greyrock/keep it very casual and just talk about reality shows with", "Yeah, Rachel accidentally has to wear a pirate costume to her ex husbands wedding, because her dress got ripped and so she grabs a costume from the adjoining bar mitzvah at the hotel event center, right? Hilarious to watch on tv.", "This was *supposed* to be a very nice drama free event. And aside from the random pirate, it was. I understand that some people have wacky weddings where they do goofy stuff. And that\u2019s very cool. This just wasn\u2019t a costume party free for all", "I wish I had the guts to do this. And certainly have plotted revenge. My revenge fantasies are much darker than this though.", "There are good reasons I didn\u2019t even invite my brother to my wedding because he would have done something insane for the same reason. Super babied and can do no wrong because he\u2019s the only boy. \ud83d\ude44 \n\n\nI feel your pain. NTA. I get from your post and comments you had to invite him otherwise it would have caused a lot of chaos.", "I certainly would have been amused to see him in the get up, right up until I saw the expression on your face and realized it was not what the wedding couple planned for their special event. I'm so sorry your wedding was tarnished and family is so disrespectful. Perhaps someday you can renew your vows, leave the jerks off the invite list, and have better security for anyone who tries to sneak a repeat of his antics in.", "Yeah, sounds like someone you do not need in your life.", "Makes sense to me. I wouldn\u2019t want capn jack sparrow at my wedding either!", "That\u2019s so cool that you were able to have the wedding you wanted without any dysfunctional relatives screwing it all up for you!!!!", "I do wonder how I might have reacted if it had been a complete surprise instead of being warned ahead of time and saying please no. I wondered if I would have been more ok with it? Or if I would have been even more upset", "Oh you don\u2019t even want to get me started about his munchausen by proxy wife", "Extra extra points if it is a baby shower!", "bwahahahaha", "Oh man. My mom wasn't quite as bad but my sisters and I were always FULLY aware that she would have preferred all boys and our one brother was her favorite. Big hugs to you. NTA. Your brother is a dick.", "They don't deserve you.\n\nYou deserve better.", "I'd read that book and if it's really good get it publish and maybe an awesome movie will get made.", "NTA\n\nunless explicitly invited to, weddings are not the place for cosplay.\n\nMaybe you have too many issues related fo your family because they are dismissive of your feelings because you\u2019re not the family favorite.", "Is Pirate Bro the golden child?\n\nYou are not too sensitive.  IMO, he made the event about him and not and your spouse.  He stole the limelight.\n\nHe didn't have to interrupt you first dance, but he did..\n\nYour brother was the a$$hole.\n\nNTA", "NTA \u2014 that was disrespectful of him to do after you said for him not to.\nAs a youngest child myself I can relate to being the one that gets picked on/teased, and expected to just take it in good humour despite how much it just feels like your family doesn\u2019t give a shit about you. (and any pushback is treated like YOU rocking the boat)", "Or, OP should have had him keelhauled.", "If they don't have you as a target, they'll turn on each other and they don't want that...", "Withholding approval is a game they play. It makes them feel dominant until you reject them.", "That's exactly what they intended...", "Please write the book you mentioned in another comment. PLEASE.", "Low Contact\n\nI am so sorry, I don't know you but your pain and hurt caused by your asshole brother and enabling flying monkey family comes out so clearly, I am outraged for you. \n\nGoing NC is best for you, it doesn't sound like you ever had a loving supportive family because your screwed-up brother always needs it to be all about him with your family stuck so far up his behind they can't see the sunshine.", "You\u2019re in good company; Indiana Jones was named after the dog.\n\nOh, and NTA.", "Good for you", "I think mine would be a great soap opera. We can write them together.", "Nta but he sure is an asshole", "Pay for him to be photoshopped out or EVERY SINGLE PHOTO", "NTA\n\nyou provided a reasonable boundary, he violated that.", "They\u2019re all awful. You\u2019re the only sane one in the family. I hope you do write a series of books, off#ng him in a different and horrible way in every one. \n\nOh and NTA", "He's a Decatur older than you and he decided to dress in a costume to your wedding. I'm no psychologist but this sounds enough like arrested development to me.", "Indiana Jones?", "Cozies are huge right now. A cozy mystery or fantasy where you find the body of your estranged brother behind the bar on the sailing ship (hired out for a wedding) and the local cops think you did it. \n\nIf you make the setting a cosplay party on the ship, you can be the kidnapped princess or Tinkerbell or the captain and your husband the first mate \u2014 the prime suspects\u2026.", "His real name is Henry. Indiana was the dogs name when he was a kid.", "Jep, what was his son\u2019s name? I have forgotten because I usually think of him as \u201cThe Brat\u201d", "Ohhhh and make your parrot the vital clue to solve the case. You can go indie on Amazon.", "Also Henry. But he was called Mutt. Played by Shai Lebouf."]}
