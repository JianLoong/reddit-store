There's a reason behind the distinction legally, and jumping all over the difference without embracing the why behind it (and demanding your daughter do the same) makes it sounds like you care less and are eager to look out for your own interests first.\n\nMy concern with your ex-wife is that she is functionally incapable of telling you no or her concerns directly without a give-and-take and without passive-aggressively putting your child in the middle--I mean you just brought up the subject, and as you say you're still providing support for your daughter.
