However, I am assuming that there is little doubt about it, even though you are insisting on paternity being established. Which is the smart thing to do.\n\nThe former friend shouldn't be reaching out to you to make a sibling connection. It is in no way your responsibility to set it in motion.  However, it is harsh to say that your son will never have a relationship or meet with the baby if she is his sister. And that shouldn't be just you making that decision. He could reach out when he is an adult. And he might resent you for not letting him meet his sibling. Your husband is horrible for not wanting to be involved with her life if she is his daughter. He was fine with being involved with her conception, and he certainly shouldn't be leaving you alone to deal with the situation. I would have just told everyone to speak to him and not badger you about it. \n\nAlso, if this is your husband's child, neither of you are going to be able to forget about her existence, especially if your husband's family have already taken her and the mother into the family. He is probably going to have to pay child support, and just because he doesn't want to be in her life now, doesn't mean that isn't going to change. And you may have to deal with being a step mom and visitation and all that. I feel like this should have been discussed when you found out the former friend was pregnant. You seem adamant that you don't hate the baby, but the fact she exists does upset you. And those feelings need to be dealt with.", "ESH, your husband is really awful and I don't know why you got back together from when you were separated. I'm not entirely sure if I view extramarital sex while the the parties are separated as cheating be he's certainly wrong for not using protection and not taking care of the baby he caused.

You reserve the right to say no now, and maybe change later depending on life circumstances.  I wish I had a judgement, but I\u2019m wavering.  Good luck, and as you know - it\u2019s not the babies fault.  I think your husband is a low key AH. Great for sticking up for you - jackass for not wanting anything to do with that child.

It kind of sounds like you're not over it either, honestly.", "Eh, I'll probably get downvoted, but YTA... not because you don't want to have any relationship with the product of your husband's affair but because you're doing so while maintaining a relationship with the actual adulterer. If you're going to cut anyone off, it should be the person who actually did something wrong or at least it should *also\" be that person. Your husband did wrong; the child did not. Either include both in your life or cut both off.\n\nAlso, if his family has a relationship with her, she and your son WILL know about each other and WILL meet, so you taking this stance is only going to confuse both children and, given your attitude, it will probably lead to anger and even hatred in your son toward an in innocent victim.", "NTA", "ESH - why is everyone cool with this guy being a shit parent?

He can choose to not pursue visitation, but he cant relinquish his parental rights. He will still have to pay child support, and in most states a higher amount of child support if he doesnt have custody time.", "Here's the thing. BOTH people consent to sex knowing that's how babies happen. That's what I'm trying to say. \n\nPeople have to be more careful or more selective when it comes to who they are having sex with.", "Sadly, I've known children who have had zero interaction with their birth father, at the father's insistence. They got child support money but were refused any chance to meet, even when the father was dying.", "He is even more a dead beat dad than that! OP said in a comment he didn't want ANY children and she thinks he would stop seeing their son if he wouldn't want her back... That's REALLY shitty...", "Yes, but women can then give the kids on adoption or abort them.\n\nMen don't.\n\nGiving half of the population more power than the other is not the way of doing the things, that's what I am trying to say.\n\nPeople need to be able to reject children or be accounted by them, we can't set a double standard.", "Sometimes it's easy to confuse an asshole with someone who is just tryna deal with shit.", "Yikes doesn't want any kids but just out here making them. I'm sure he has zero involvement with their kid already.", "But she's denying the children their right to be in each other's lifes. That's not ok. Little girl is innocent. Also, since DHs family accepted her, how does she think is going to work keeping them apart?", "The mother of his child wasn't an AP. OP and her husband weren't toghether when the child was conceived. Thankfully his family is way better than him and both children deserve to have each other in their lives.", "Her son is innocent too, and has the right to know his step sister!  I got YTA, they split, he didn't cheat on her...  to me this seems like sour grapes on OP's part.  He could be a total tool, but that's still on her since she's staying in a relationship with him.", "Husband is an AH and OP is an AH for not recognizing that. \n\nOP, it is highly likely your marriage to an AH won't last. At that point you and your former friend might find you have more in common than you realize. You don't have to befriend her now, but be careful about dismissing her and her child. Your paths WILL cross again (especially considering your in-laws involvement in her life) and you're going to be held accountable for how you're behaving. How do you think that will play out? What will your son think of you?", "1. sort out paternity\n2. He needs to decide what his plan is with regards to this child (presuming he is the father).\n3. OP needs to spend some serious time thinking ahead at how this will impact the future.\n   1. If husband is to have any contact with the child will this be at their house?\n   2. Get a second place for these visits?\n   3. How about grandparents? They seem more than keen to accept this child into their family. Will they keep in touch even if husband does not? Will they then meet this child at various family gatherings?\n   4. if husband is to have no contact, is this the type of man OP wishes to be with? Someone who produces a child in such a messy manner, making it impossible for the daughter, son or any other family members to move forward with truly separate lives.\n   5. How will OP deal with ex-friend, they have children by the same man, now.\n4. OP needs to spend some serious time wondering if this marriage can survive this.\n5. What is best for OP's son?\n\nThe whole situation sounds terribly messy, OP cannot simply pretend the daughter does not exist as extende family has made it clear they intend to include her.", "A relationship between the son and the daughter is the fathers responsibility, not OP'. Why do we let the man off the hook?", "THEY WERE NOT TOGETHER. He didn't cheat. Tabarnak", "Thank you.", "Probably because he can\u2019t be loyal lol", "Right now, the son in 3 years old.   So I think yeah, at this point there is not this sense of urgency for them to meet.  Maybe when he\u2019s a little older.  And even then, it should come from the father.", "Good for you. What is your relationship like with the child. Are you able to love it and withold resentments? I feel like I could when they are young and when they are old enough to potentially dislike I'd probably love them by then. so surely it could be done. but you know it's easier to say how youd things you've not been through so idk if that's asking too much.", "Who is the helpless child she's abandoning?", "I literally stated he got someone pregnant during their separation? Reread my love.", "To each their own. OP is way more whatever adjective you'd like to use here than me. Hahaha", "Then their father should facilitate that relationship.", "Yes, yes, and yes. He can never be trusted again. I don't think this is going to end well at all.", "This should be the top comment IMO", "If he had zero interest in trying to get me back then I think there\u2019s a chance he would stop seeing our son as often but there\u2019s other factors like my FIL that would influence if he completely stops seeing him or not.", "He doesn't care about the daughter, it's her mother he wants close.", "Yep. My son's father is like this. My son just turned 18 and his dad has seen him like 4 times in his entire life. He doesn't keep employment very long but when he does have a job, I get about $26 a month that is garnished from his wages..Lol. I don't know what I would do without his financial contribution \ud83d\ude44", "Ugh.  Take this man to get a vasectomy and leave his ass there.", "OP, I suggest you read what you have posted here. \n\n1. Your husband bribed his ex girlfriend with hush money to hide his child from you.\n\n2. He lied by omission. \n\n3. The moment the truth came out, he completely cut any type of financial support for his child (aka he is a deadbeat.)\n\n4. You got back with him, are fine with this, and have no intention of going anywhere.\n\n5. His family called him out on being a deadbeat  and since you are OK with his actions, they called you out, too. He punished them by pulling his financial support.\n\n6. He never wanted kids. You knew this. Yet he has two kids, one of which is your own and the other he has abandoned. \n\n7. Based on this comment, you know that he will treat you and your kid just like his ex girlfriend and his new child the instant he cannot benefit from you.... And, based on you being fine with your husband being a deadbeat, his family may not be super supportive when he is a deadbeat to you.\n\nBless your heart OP.....", "I\u2019m sorry did you read that comment before you posted that? The way you phrased it he only sees his son so much just to get to you. If he didn\u2019t want you he wouldn\u2019t want to see his own child as much???\n\nGirl, once he finds someone he deems better he\u2019s going to leave you and your son, and you\u2019ll be lucky if the next girl tried to get him to foster a relationship with your kid like you are with his daughter.", ">other factors like my FIL that would influence if he completely stops seeing him or not.\n\nHow does your FIL feel about your husband's \"potential\" daughter? Is he influencing your husband about her? Does FIL want your husband to have a relationship with the child?\n\nOP, despite everything you have been through, you seem to have a realistic view. It may not the type of relationship or mind frame that people feel comfortable with, but at least you are being honest with yourself about where you stand.", "Why would you subject your child to living with a parent that you don\u2019t even think is particularly interested in or committed to him?", "So he's only using your child to get back together with you?", "This is just pathetic at this point. Why the hell would you go back to a man who you just admitted would abandon your child if given the chance?? Huh??", "Why are so many people pretending that parents treat all children equally all the time to tonight? This is AITA where countless stories of golden child/scapegoat situations are posted. He wanted his son, he does not want his daughter. You need to accept the fact that some sperm/egg doners are not crappy parents because they aren't parents to their children at all whether you like it or not. I don't like it but that doesn't mean I'm going to pretend it's not true. If the kids are better off without them then they shouldn't be a part of their lives and I don't really care if that means the parents got off without punishment for abandoning them. The only thing that really matters here is that the child is safe and raised by a parent(s) that actually want to be the best parent they can be. You can try and convince all the deadbeats to step up all you want but at the end of the day if they don't want to they won't and if they won't the kids shouldn't have to endure their shitty \"parenting\" at all.", "I think my FIL is encouraging him not to be involved. If he was telling him to be involved, everything would be different.", "I'm not saying that parents do. What I'm saying is that parents who have been good to one child have demonstrated they have the ability to do that for *all* their children if they wanted to, so I'm not inclined to let them off the hook for something they've shown they can do but choose not to.\n\nWill all parents step up? Of course not. Do I reserve the right to think less of them if they don't? Absolutely.\n\nThe fact that some kids may be better off without crappy parents doesn't make those parents any less crappy.", "How is any of this not a red flag? He can\u2019t make decisions without listening to his daddy?", "In another comment op says she separated with him for 3 months and the baby is 7 months old with a mutual friend unless she's waited 16 months to tell this story and the baby was conceived the instant after they separated then he cheated.", "Okay think less of them then. Go for gold. That does absolutely nothing for the children though. I'll personally be spending my time thinking of the children but whatever. You do you."]}
