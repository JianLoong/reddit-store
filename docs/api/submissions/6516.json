However, I am assuming that there is little doubt about it, even though you are insisting on paternity being established. Which is the smart thing to do.\n\nThe former friend shouldn't be reaching out to you to make a sibling connection. It is in no way your responsibility to set it in motion.  However, it is harsh to say that your son will never have a relationship or meet with the baby if she is his sister. And that shouldn't be just you making that decision. He could reach out when he is an adult. And he might resent you for not letting him meet his sibling. Your husband is horrible for not wanting to be involved with her life if she is his daughter. He was fine with being involved with her conception, and he certainly shouldn't be leaving you alone to deal with the situation. I would have just told everyone to speak to him and not badger you about it. \n\nAlso, if this is your husband's child, neither of you are going to be able to forget about her existence, especially if your husband's family have already taken her and the mother into the family. He is probably going to have to pay child support, and just because he doesn't want to be in her life now, doesn't mean that isn't going to change. And you may have to deal with being a step mom and visitation and all that. I feel like this should have been discussed when you found out the former friend was pregnant. You seem adamant that you don't hate the baby, but the fact she exists does upset you. And those feelings need to be dealt with.", "ESH, your husband is really awful and I don't know why you got back together from when you were separated. I'm not entirely sure if I view extramarital sex while the the parties are separated as cheating be he's certainly wrong for not using protection and not taking care of the baby he caused. You also are punishing a child and the mother for something that happened when you two weren't together which is why you suck.", "This is so hard.  Emotions are high.  You reserve the right to say no now, and maybe change later depending on life circumstances.  I wish I had a judgement, but I\u2019m wavering.  Good luck, and as you know - it\u2019s not the babies fault.  I think your husband is a low key AH. Great for sticking up for you - jackass for not wanting anything to do with that child.

It kind of sounds like you're not over it either, honestly.", "Eh, I'll probably get downvoted, but YTA... not because you don't want to have any relationship with the product of your husband's affair but because you're doing so while maintaining a relationship with the actual adulterer. If you're going to cut anyone off, it should be the person who actually did something wrong or at least it should *also\" be that person. Your husband did wrong; the child did not. Either include both in your life or cut both off.\n\nAlso, if his family has a relationship with her, she and your son WILL know about each other and WILL meet, so you taking this stance is only going to confuse both children and, given your attitude, it will probably lead to anger and even hatred in your son toward an in innocent victim.", "NTA", "ESH - why is everyone cool with this guy being a shit parent?

At 3 years old he cannot make a decision about this but if they are siblings and if you stick to your guns about never meeting the kid, eventually you will have to let your son meet her. I'm personally of the opinion he has to meet her at least once before he decides to have nothing to do with her because that is blood, but I was raised in the south and blood matters here.

You won't ever have a leg to stand on if he ever chooses to blame you for stopping him from having a relationship with his half sibling. He'll be right by definition and you'll be wrong by definition. You can't win this argument against your child, you'll always lose. So don't set yourself up for a fight you'll definitely lose.
