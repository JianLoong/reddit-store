It's also 1000% bad form and poor taste to complain about money woes to someone that you know has it worse than you.\n\nThat being said, the troubles in a person's life are still their troubles. Maybe from your view point she has nothing to complain about, but it's all relative and there are millions of people across the world that could literally make the same complaint about you.\n\n\"meanwhile my boyfriend and I won't even have a Christmas tree this year and probably just skip Christmas all together.\"\n\nA lot of people won't even have FOOD today, let alone on Christmas. \n\nIf you guys are really friends, I'd have a conversation with her about how it makes you uncomfortable to listen to her money woes when you have it worse and then let it drop. Hopefully she'll be more tactful in the future, but it doesn't cost you anything to be empathetic to someone's problems, even if they're still better off than you.", "I mean you're not wrong, but it's all relative. Everything she's describing is legitimately stressing her out. Just because you have a much worse situation  than her doesn't mean it isn't also a  struggle for her. But you don't have to hear her talk about the woes of only being able to afford a four-day a holiday instead of a week. Probably bringing it up sooner, and in a calmer way, might have it helps navigate this before you lost your patience with her entirely. I'm going to say ESH, and encourage you to find a way to have an open conversation with her.\n\nEditing to add the thing is really you're both on the same side. She's comfortable, but she's not rich rich. She's not the enemy rich. In a class war you and she would both still be against the billionaires.", "YTA. I understand your frustration. I've been around people like her, too. But, you should've explained to her nicely your perspective and how her complaints made you feel instead of vilifying her \"ignorance.\" She sounds like she'd understand you based on your story.  \n\nAnd, inflation does affect everyone. It's a b\\*\\*\\*h.", "Have you ever heard of \"outside looking in\"? \n\n\nYou see what she shows the flat, her car, and the trips but do you honestly know her finances, do you have her bank statements? Maybe she's maxing out credit cards to have the lifestyle she lives, maybe her or her husband's parents are footing the bill...you just don't know.\n\n\nInflation is affecting everyone and she has the right to complain just as much as you do, so NAH.", "This makes YTA.  \"I told her that I'm sick of her constantly whining about not being even richer.\"  \n\n\nWhy do you even think it is OK to talk to a \"friend\" like that?  It is one thing to explain that you are in different realms when it comes to money.  It is something else entirely to rub her nose in those differences.    \n\n\n\"maybe she truly is just too privileged to see my point\"  This doesn't help your case.  If you were really a friend, you would simply call her up and apologize for starting the fight.", "YTA\n\nyou dont get to decide how bad other peoples struggles are. a recession is a recession. there were reasonable and respectful ways to tell her you didnt want to discuss money stuff with her without insulting and belittling her.\n\nedit to add: i find it ridiculous when people dont communicate something, then just wait until theyre extremely pissed about it and blow up on the other person and think theyd valid for it. you failed to once communicate you didnt want to discuss these topics, youre an asshole for erasing her problems and stressors because you think only you can be stressed about money", "YTA. She is too privileged to see your point? Nahhh, you\u2019re too envious to see how you are wrong.", ">She told me she had no idea I think of her like this and she can lend me some money if I need it\n\nInfo: Had you told her of your financial situation before this argument?", "YTA, when people play the pain Olympics, everyone loses. She could definitely be a little more circumspect, but I get the impression she's trying to connect with you and share what's on her mind. \n\nMy advice, genuinely, take a tiny bit of her money, let her ease your pain a little bit. Don't take like a giant vacation with it or something, but enough for that Christmas tree you wanted, or a nice dinner out with your boyfriend. You'll both be happier and feel closer, I love it when I can help out a friend and make their life a bit better.\n\n I'm doing well enough for myself but many of my friends are struggling. I take them out to eat, for a night at the pub together, with the understanding that they can probably never pay me back. But I love them very much and at the end of the night they can let go, and I feel better to see them happy. \n\nPoverty is a bitch because you will spiral. Even when you eventually get money your self worth is so crushed by society calling you trash that you ingrain that into yourself. You and your partner deserve to be treated like human beings, let your friends help you.", "YTA- Everyone being stressed over money or whatever it is is valid. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool for you to decide what someone can be upset over and what someone shouldn\u2019t be upset over. Yeah, she\u2019s in a better position than you but she has her own goals and such that she wants to accomplish just like you do. When you called the husband a \u2018poor thing,\u2019 that\u2019s when I became less understanding of your situation and less empathetic for you. You should apologize for your outburst.", "YTA - She may normally have a higher standard of living than you, but that\u2019s life and something we all have to cope with. You have a roof over you heads, and food in your bellies. A lot of people don\u2019t even have that much. Everyone is feeling the pinch at the moment, and while it is poor form of your friend to be complaining at you when you\u2019re less well off, it is equally poor form of you to be so jealous and bitter that her lifestyle is nicer than yours. It doesn\u2019t sound like your friend was being malicious, more that she lacked tact and consideration in this particular matter.\n\nBoth of you have a great deal to be thankful for. Perhaps you should spend some time this Christmas doing some volunteer or charity work, rather than being so resentful of your friend.", "Yta. All people can have money problems. Even people who look rich", "YTA.  I cannot stand people who play the trauma Olympics.  Unless you have seen their bank statements and bills and investments and everything else, you really have no idea what their financial situation is.  It just sounds like you are jealous that they do all of this stuff when you can't.  It sucks that you are having financial troubles, but that doesn't mean that her financial struggles are any less stressful.  And for you to minimize and disregard her feelings makes you a bad friend.", "YTA Everyone has it worse than someone. While you're lashing out at her about how you can't pay bills and likely won't have a Christmas, at least you have a home. You're focused on your own struggles just as she is focused on hers. Just because she has some things better than you doesn't mean she isn't struggling. \n\nVery telling that you lashed out at her when she opened up to you yet she instantly tried to help you when she realized what you were going through. Despite her own struggles, she instantly was willing to give up more to help you.", "If she has piles of debt - she might be in the same boat as you but doesn't realize it.", "YTA. Inflation is impacting all of us. There doesn't need to be a competition in terms of who's finding it harder.\n\nBut really YTA for the way you spoke to her. If you'd calmy and politely explained that you were struggling and found it hard hearing her complain about a holiday, I'd have said N T A. Instead you opted to be rude, and yet even then, she was still willing to try and help you if she could - I certainly wouldn't have offered to loan you money.\n\nAlso I'm going to be frank, she does not sound 'rich'.", "YTA. Everyone has struggles. You don\u2019t get to decide what is or isn\u2019t a problem for her. You should work on your jealousy. She seems like a nice friend if she\u2019s offering to help you out", "NAH. Just because she\u2019s wealthy doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t struggling with these changes to the financial landscape. Lifestyle creep is real, and these problems are real for her. \n\nHer repetitive complaints to you were a bit tone deaf and you naturally got frustrated. It would have been ideal to talk to her calmly rather than snapping, but what\u2019s done is done. \n\nJust apologize for snapping out of frustration, explain how you feel, and suggest that financial complaints be off the table for a while.", "YTA \n\nYou are obviously very jealous of your friend. \n\nYou are being grossly judgmental. \n\nYou are projecting your insecurities onto her and demanding what she can and can not discuss in front of you. \n\nHere is the reality\u2026\n\nWealth and privilege are relative to those who judge.\n\nTo a BILLION people around the world who live in abject poverty, YOU are wealthy and PRIVILEGED. Please think about that for a moment. \n\nYou are not being a good friend.", "I think it\u2019s an ESH for me. I hate trauma Olympics. It shouldn\u2019t be a competition and someone having a rough time should be able to vent. But I also think you need to read the room. Of course a twisted ankle and using crutches for a couple weeks warrants irritation and complaining. But constantly complaining to someone who is recovering from spinal surgery and in a wheelchair for months isn\u2019t the most sensitive move ever. The same goes for complaining about your vacations to someone struggling to pay rent. Consideration should be shown for a friend. \n\nIf she\u2019s your friend then she should be aware you are financially unable to do Christmas this year from just casual conversation asking what your plans were. Conversely, you should recognize that money stress is real at every level.\n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, it sticks out to me that she said they\u2019re in so much debt. She could have been living way beyond her means for years and now with interest rates and prices up she could be in a house of cards about to topple. She may genuinely not be in the position you think she is.", "Being grateful for what you have, whether in your friend's situation or in your situation, is always the best thing. I totally get how her being ungrateful for what she has is irksome to you. I don't think your TA; I think most would find that hard to listen to. If she doesn't stop after you've kind of let her know how you feel, if it were me, I'd either cut them off and change the subject to something else, or spend less time around them. I wouldn't end the friendship over it, I'd just limit it to something more tolerable for me. Best wishes.", "Soft YTA for the way you went about it but I completely get it. I use to complain about gas prices to my rich ex friend and she hit me with \u201cwhy even worry about gas, you have to pay for it anyway. I buy premium gas\u201d. No girl you don\u2019t buy premium gas. Your rich parents buy you premium gas. They just don\u2019t get it", "Tbh i don't think either of you are the asshole, but i think that you need to find different friends if you can't help but be envious. Or just kindly tell her to not talk about finances again because you're not comfortable talking about it. \n\nThe vast majority of money that people have are earned. If you're lowkey unhappy about your salary, you should do something about it. That doesn't invalidate her struggles though. \n\nI would think about your compatibility as friends", "YTA but I get it.  The thing is you need to realize it's all about all about perceptions.  Her life, while objectively is nowhere near as tough as yours, is changing and they are having to make cut backs - she has every right to complain about this as you do about your situation.\n\nI once worked for a company where the directors took a 40% pay cut during a recession to try and save jobs.  Now there were plenty of people that said well if I earned X i could afford to take a paycut, but the thing is people tend to live within their means.  So these directors had big houses, expensive cars, kids in private school etc and while yes it's more difficult to have sympathy for them than someone who needs to budget for bread and milk they are still entitled to feel the pain of the change in circumstances.", "I would vote NAH. You are probably right that she genuinely doesn\u2019t see how good she has it. No matter how good you have it, it\u2019s still scary to have to drastically cut back on a lifestyle you\u2019d planned/ grown accustomed too. You are definitely not wrong to be frustrated that she can\u2019t see your struggle is arguably worse and she\u2019s being a bit insensitive by complaining. It\u2019s good you pointed it out. Hopefully she will stop discussing \u201chow hard she has it\u201d in front of you. If she doesn\u2019t, then NTA and maybe pull back from spending time with her.", "NAH. There are people out there struggling to pay their energy bills. But for what it's worth, I don't think she was doing it to rub it in your face, I think she thought that both of you were in the same boat, which you aren't. You gave her a much needed reality check, and hopefully she's going to be much more self aware now when complaining about money around her friends.", "YTA and not having a conversation about the differences in your lifestyles and how they are affected by the each of your monetary differences was due long ago. \n\nWhy wait until your friend is having their version of a financial crisis to express how uneven your lives are? \n\nBy doing so your the one actually trying to \u2018play the victim\u2019, not them. Having friendships is based on open communication and not doing so builds resentment and leads to disagreements.", "YTA, but I wouldn't worry. You're probably not friends anymore.", "YTA\n\nYour financial problems are your own. You seem to find it unfair she has more than you but then again its not her fault she has a better life. One can complain about money and yet be 10x richer than the average person in Somalia or Venezuela. \n  You made her feel bad about having a good job, property and financial worries. She likely travels a lot because its something she values in life and finds it a priority. Not like she is a billionaire complaining about the payments of her 7th Ferrari. \n  You overreacted, seems like she didnt complain about anything to make you purposely feel bad about your own financial situation.", "INFO Do you ever complain about rent? \n\n>Meanwhile I have to rent, haven't been abroad in probably 10 years and almost live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nHow is that different than complaining about a mortgage? Where I live it's easy for rent and a mortgage to be the same amount.\n\n>How is she not rich at all, but has no problem lending me money?? I\n\nIt might be that she has just enough to be able to lend you some. My friends and I do lend each other money and none of us are rich. When we had even less we used to as well if could. Because sometimes you're just in a slightly better spot. Or the same place but someone's car got broken into and they can't fix the window.\n\nIt doesn't sound like your friend is trying to be mean. It sounds like she is talking about the same stresses that everyone has. So what would you want from her? She isn't allowed to mention anything but you can?", "If her husband has to take the bus to work because gas is too expensive, they aren't \"well off\" or rich.   Just because someone is doing better than you doesn't make them well off.  Your friend might have been insensitive to your situation, but based on your post it wasn't intentional nor malicious.  Also, if you never discussed with her how your finances were doing, she might not have even been aware of your circumstance.  \n\nYTA", "YTA first world problems are still problems to someone.", "NTA.  Basic good manners says that you don't complain to someone who has the exact same problem, but worse.  If you're skinny and trying to lose 5lbs, you don't complain about it to your fat friend.  If you're rich with mild money trouble, you don't complain to your poor friend.  \n\nThis shit is basic.", "NTA. \n\nYou're right in that inflation affects everyone differently, and the sacrifices Hailey will have to make will be different than the ones you will. \n\nI will say though in some fairness to Hailey, just because she's your oldest friends does not mean she necessarily knows 100% the specifics of your finances. She may have been shocked to realize that you are strapped in the way that you are.", "YTA, you\u2019re obviously a bit jealous of her, and that\u2019s fine", "I wouldn't call her well-off if she has debt (maybe not being American. I have a different world view). She may be living a better life to the one you are living, but that does not make her well off. As for holidays, there are plenty of deals available if you shop, right. I'm going to go with soft YTA for assuming. A lot of people live a life of show but don't have much to back it up. I don't know the tone used, but she could genuinely want to help you by offering money... the question is, do you want to lose this friendship over some petty jealousy that isn't even real as your friend isn't truly well off.", "YTA. She has the right to complain the same as you, if you can\u2019t be a sympathetic/empathetic friend that\u2019s on you, but she doesn\u2019t have to stop talking about finances bc YOU\u2019VE decided you\u2019re in a worse financial place than she is.", "YTA.

I get it, though.\n\nYour best bet, if you want to preserve the friendship, is realize that even if you'd love to have her problems, her problems feel very real to her. She's adjusting her lifestyle, it sucks, and she's venting to a friend.\n\nAlso, if you never really talked to her about your own financial troubles (likely, as she seems to not have known and then offered you money), she couldn't really know that her complaining was affecting you like that.\n\nApologize, have a discussion about what boundaries you'd like, and then move on.

One son died within the first few days; the other son died around 5 1/2 months. Our daughter was able to come home after 4 months in the NICU. Before you could be released you had to take a first-aid type of class that specifically focused on infants. We were in the class with around 4-5 other couples.\n\nOur instructor had to leave for a bit at the beginning of the class, leaving us all sitting around the table. One mother wanted to go around to talk about how long they'd been there at the NICU. She started and expounded for a while about how they'd been there 3 whole weeks and how awful it was to have been there so long. The other couples had been there similar times \\[anywhere from 1-3 weeks\\], and the first mom commiserated with each one about how awful and how long those 3 weeks were.\n\nTo say I'd been biting down hard on my cheek was an understatement. Three weeks? I'll admit I was thinking 'boo-freaking-hoo.' Try doing FOUR MONTHS. Plus, our other son was still alive at that point and we had even more time to go beyond that. When our turn finally came and she asked how long we'd been there, I told her.\n\nTo her credit, her eyes got big, and she got quiet for a moment. Then, she said, \"Well, that shut MY mouth.\" Part of me wanted to say, \"Yep, it did. Next time think of that before whining about your super awful three week stay.\" Thankfully, God really pushed down on me in that moment and reminded me of grace. Instead, I said, \"You know, it's just hard having a baby and having to leave without them. And it doesn't matter if it's for a few weeks or a few months--- it's hard.\" It didn't hurt to remember that one of the babies in our area of the NICU had been there around a year due to feeding issues. How could I whine about four months when that family had been there almost a year?\n\nYour friend needs to learn that while we may all be in the same ocean, we're not all in the same boat.

I do think that she needed to know that, because even if it didn\u2019t relate to you, you would have saved her from sounding like an arrogant prick around other people.

My friend told me she felt poor (as a homeowner with an inheritance), and that \u2018all she wanted\u2019 was to be able to holiday whenever she wanted, and never have to worry about a bill at a restaurant. It hurt being so financially precarious compared to that, and the assumption we were in the same position when I earned an income below the tax threshold that year.", "More people should read this.\nPlease accept my poor woman\u2019s award: \ud83e\udd47", "He is a construction worker and usually works 12 hours 6 days a week. It changes around a bit depending on the current job, but it's always at least 60 hours.\n\nHe doesn't get sick days or any paid time off, if he doesn't work, no money. We also try to things 50-50 so his salary doesn't matter that much to me personally and he sends some of it home to his family in Ukraine.\n\nMy workplace used to pay for the overtime, but now they say they will give it back to us as extra paid days off next year, which sucks...\n\nWe are luckily not exactly paycheck to paycheck, but close to it. There was a month where both of us were sick for 1.5 weeks and that was pretty hard.", "It's so sad that you can't grasp the very simple concept that people at all socioeconomic levels can have financial stress. Not being able to understand this indicates that your financial position will never improve.", "I kind of doubt that they are friends anymore after what OP did.", "Some folk just weren't raised right - and most of them are on Reddit.", ">I am shocked at all the y t a votes. I hate it when people who are well off complain about not having it good enough.\n\nBecause OP's friend isn't \"well-off\" or at least not that well off that they shouldn't be complaining.\n\n>or <gasp> riding the bus?! \n\nIf they were really that well off, would they be taking the bus to save gas money?  Sure they are in a better position than OP, it doesn't mean they have fuck you money and are immune to financial pressures, hence the YTA votes.", "Yes, someone always has it worse - so don't bother *that person* with your trouble.  Find someone else.  Funny you talk a lot about compassion, but only in the context of what you want to have from others - while you refuse to have even basic consideration for others yourself.", "It's so sad that you think the financial stress of the middle to upper class is similar to those living paycheck to paycheck. I was like the latter and am now financially secure. Because of my reality I know that the inflation, while rough on me as well, impacts people like OP way more than it does me. Your comment and condescending tone reflect the bubble you're living in. Be humble.", "Depends where you are. Renting isn\u2019t uncommon in many places, especially for working professionals in city. In Europe, car isn\u2019t a necessity and plenty of people don\u2019t have one. A lot of people don\u2019t even have driving licence because they can get anywhere with public transportation. Some people hate travelling. If you\u2019re in Europe, you can typically go abroad for quite cheap, sometimes even cheaper than domestic holiday. Honestly, with some people, you really can\u2019t tell because they mask well.  \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d never discuss with anyone my financial situation. Even my closest family doesn\u2019t have an idea how much i make, even roughly. I can overspend on some things and under spend on other which tends to make people confused.", "Not sure I agree. There are some fields where salaries aren't well known outside their field. And the funny thing is that most people judge based on someone's consumption habits which can be misleading. \n\nI have a relatively small house and I keep my cars a long time. Therefore many of my friends thought I was in worse shape financially than I actually was. My previous car was totalled in an accident and some comments after I got a new one made me realize people thought I had kept the previous one because I *couldn't afford* a new car. (It was 15 years old had good gas mileage and ran well).", "Exactly! I think they are still living paycheck to paycheck, and when they get a little bit of extra money they put it on an international vacation instead of a savings account. So now that everything is costing more, it's hurting them too.", "1000000%", "I can\u2019t imagine hearing someone complain that they \u201conly\u201d get a 4 day vacation in Barcelona. There had been times this year when my partner and I were eating rice and cheap cuts of chicken for every meal because that\u2019s all we could afford. We had to move back with family because we were going to be homeless otherwise. \nI can\u2019t imagine bitching about \u201conly\u201d have 1 short vacation or *gasp* having to ride the bus.", "Wow you sound so bitter. Maybe try therapy?", "True but that does depend on repayment terms. I might offer a loan to a friend I know is sensitive about being seen to take 'charity' and never mention it again unless they do.", "So, it\u2019s \u201cbitter\u201d to explain an example of how people with a high income can \u201cnot have money\u201d on a post about how someone with high income complains about money? Lol. \n\nAlso \u201cmaybe try therapy\u201d how do you know I\u2019m not already doing therapy? Sounds like you\u2019d rather be disrespectful than productive.", "OK well, you're an AH for what you said to your friend - hope you apologize to her.", "No that\u2019s a private matter that many people consider crass to discuss with anyone other than immediate family.", "A lot of people live beyond their means and hence are in debt but going on lavish vacations.", "Okay I agree that OP is the AH, but I will push back on your statement that going by car isn't a luxury - that is enormously dependent on where you are. I earn 6 figures with no dependents and couldn't realistically afford to drive to work here (London) - that really is reserved for people on a good chunk more than I make", "Got a mate with the lifestyle - big house, flash car, big holidays every year. It\u2019s all on credit, even though he\u2019s earned very good money for decades. Crazy.", "Some people start making money to plan for early retirement and then forget what all that money is for and spend it... Then out comes the personal lines of credit and that gold card. Boggles my mind. I have about 9k in cc debit and it's making me lose my mind, I can't imagine what some people are doing", "I hit 10k (\u00a3) on credit cards years back. Somehow I managed to pay it off, but it\u2019s easily done.", "The vast majority of people who earn decent money have some outlet where they spend more, whether that be travel, cars, house etc. You're saying that you're earning decent money and spending it on nothing? That's atypical", "I\u2019m like scrooge mcduck i guess, i like it in stocks, accounts, tfsas, and rrsps where i can see it. I spend when i need to, like i prefer good quality shoes, but i don\u2019t pay the upcharge for designer branded when I can get very good ones from numerous other brands. Why pay for stainless steel appliances when i can spend the same money and get a nicer one in white? Why have a fully loaded land rover when I drive maybe half an hour a day and the last vehicle only left town a handful of times? Why have a 1000 channels when I only watch u-tube and netflix, and why should i have the latest greatest phone when the old one still works great?"]}
