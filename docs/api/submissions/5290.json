It's also 1000% bad form and poor taste to complain about money woes to someone that you know has it worse than you.\n\nThat being said, the troubles in a person's life are still their troubles. Maybe from your view point she has nothing to complain about, but it's all relative and there are millions of people across the world that could literally make the same complaint about you.\n\n\"meanwhile my boyfriend and I won't even have a Christmas tree this year and probably just skip Christmas all together.\"\n\nA lot of people won't even have FOOD today, let alone on Christmas. \n\nIf you guys are really friends, I'd have a conversation with her about how it makes you uncomfortable to listen to her money woes when you have it worse and then let it drop. Hopefully she'll be more tactful in the future, but it doesn't cost you anything to be empathetic to someone's problems, even if they're still better off than you.", "I mean you're not wrong, but it's all relative. Everything she's describing is legitimately stressing her out. Just because you have a much worse situation  than her doesn't mean it isn't also a  struggle for her. But you don't have to hear her talk about the woes of only being able to afford a four-day a holiday instead of a week. Probably bringing it up sooner, and in a calmer way, might have it helps navigate this before you lost your patience with her entirely. I'm going to say ESH, and encourage you to find a way to have an open conversation with her.\n\nEditing to add the thing is really you're both on the same side. She's comfortable, but she's not rich rich. She's not the enemy rich. In a class war you and she would both still be against the billionaires.", "YTA. I understand your frustration. I've been around people like her, too. But, you should've explained to her nicely your perspective and how her complaints made you feel instead of vilifying her \"ignorance.\" She sounds like she'd understand you based on your story.  \n\nAnd, inflation does affect everyone. It's a b\\*\\*\\*h.", "Have you ever heard of \"outside looking in\"? \n\n\nYou see what she shows the flat, her car, and the trips but do you honestly know her finances, do you have her bank statements? Maybe she's maxing out credit cards to have the lifestyle she lives, maybe her or her husband's parents are footing the bill...you just don't know.\n\n\nInflation is affecting everyone and she has the right to complain just as much as you do, so NAH.", "This makes YTA.  \"I told her that I'm sick of her constantly whining about not being even richer.\"  \n\n\nWhy do you even think it is OK to talk to a \"friend\" like that?  It is one thing to explain that you are in different realms when it comes to money.  It is something else entirely to rub her nose in those differences.    \n\n\n\"maybe she truly is just too privileged to see my point\"  This doesn't help your case.  If you were really a friend, you would simply call her up and apologize for starting the fight.", "YTA\n\nyou dont get to decide how bad other peoples struggles are. a recession is a recession. there were reasonable and respectful ways to tell her you didnt want to discuss money stuff with her without insulting and belittling her.\n\nedit to add: i find it ridiculous when people dont communicate something, then just wait until theyre extremely pissed about it and blow up on the other person and think theyd valid for it. you failed to once communicate you didnt want to discuss these topics, youre an asshole for erasing her problems and stressors because you think only you can be stressed about money", "YTA. She is too privileged to see your point? Nahhh, you\u2019re too envious to see how you are wrong.", ">She told me she had no idea I think of her like this and she can lend me some money if I need it\n\nInfo: Had you told her of your financial situation before this argument?", "YTA, when people play the pain Olympics, everyone loses. She could definitely be a little more circumspect, but I get the impression she's trying to connect with you and share what's on her mind. \n\nMy advice, genuinely, take a tiny bit of her money, let her ease your pain a little bit. Don't take like a giant vacation with it or something, but enough for that Christmas tree you wanted, or a nice dinner out with your boyfriend. You'll both be happier and feel closer, I love it when I can help out a friend and make their life a bit better.\n\n I'm doing well enough for myself but many of my friends are struggling. I take them out to eat, for a night at the pub together, with the understanding that they can probably never pay me back. But I love them very much and at the end of the night they can let go, and I feel better to see them happy. \n\nPoverty is a bitch because you will spiral. Even when you eventually get money your self worth is so crushed by society calling you trash that you ingrain that into yourself. You and your partner deserve to be treated like human beings, let your friends help you.", "YTA- Everyone being stressed over money or whatever it is is valid. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool for you to decide what someone can be upset over and what someone shouldn\u2019t be upset over. Yeah, she\u2019s in a better position than you but she has her own goals and such that she wants to accomplish just like you do. When you called the husband a \u2018poor thing,\u2019 that\u2019s when I became less understanding of your situation and less empathetic for you. You should apologize for your outburst.", "YTA - She may normally have a higher standard of living than you, but that\u2019s life and something we all have to cope with. You have a roof over you heads, and food in your bellies. A lot of people don\u2019t even have that much. Everyone is feeling the pinch at the moment, and while it is poor form of your friend to be complaining at you when you\u2019re less well off, it is equally poor form of you to be so jealous and bitter that her lifestyle is nicer than yours. It doesn\u2019t sound like your friend was being malicious, more that she lacked tact and consideration in this particular matter.\n\nBoth of you have a great deal to be thankful for. Perhaps you should spend some time this Christmas doing some volunteer or charity work, rather than being so resentful of your friend.", "Yta. All people can have money problems. Even people who look rich", "YTA.  I cannot stand people who play the trauma Olympics.  Unless you have seen their bank statements and bills and investments and everything else, you really have no idea what their financial situation is.  It just sounds like you are jealous that they do all of this stuff when you can't.  It sucks that you are having financial troubles, but that doesn't mean that her financial struggles are any less stressful.  And for you to minimize and disregard her feelings makes you a bad friend.", "YTA Everyone has it worse than someone. While you're lashing out at her about how you can't pay bills and likely won't have a Christmas, at least you have a home. You're focused on your own struggles just as she is focused on hers. Just because she has some things better than you doesn't mean she isn't struggling. \n\nVery telling that you lashed out at her when she opened up to you yet she instantly tried to help you when she realized what you were going through. Despite her own struggles, she instantly was willing to give up more to help you.", "If she has piles of debt - she might be in the same boat as you but doesn't realize it.", "YTA. Inflation is impacting all of us. There doesn't need to be a competition in terms of who's finding it harder.\n\nBut really YTA for the way you spoke to her. If you'd calmy and politely explained that you were struggling and found it hard hearing her complain about a holiday, I'd have said N T A. Instead you opted to be rude, and yet even then, she was still willing to try and help you if she could - I certainly wouldn't have offered to loan you money.\n\nAlso I'm going to be frank, she does not sound 'rich'.", "YTA. Everyone has struggles. You don\u2019t get to decide what is or isn\u2019t a problem for her. You should work on your jealousy. She seems like a nice friend if she\u2019s offering to help you out", "NAH. Just because she\u2019s wealthy doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t struggling with these changes to the financial landscape. Lifestyle creep is real, and these problems are real for her. \n\nHer repetitive complaints to you were a bit tone deaf and you naturally got frustrated. It would have been ideal to talk to her calmly rather than snapping, but what\u2019s done is done. \n\nJust apologize for snapping out of frustration, explain how you feel, and suggest that financial complaints be off the table for a while.", "YTA \n\nYou are obviously very jealous of your friend. \n\nYou are being grossly judgmental. \n\nYou are projecting your insecurities onto her and demanding what she can and can not discuss in front of you. \n\nHere is the reality\u2026\n\nWealth and privilege are relative to those who judge.\n\nTo a BILLION people around the world who live in abject poverty, YOU are wealthy and PRIVILEGED. Please think about that for a moment. \n\nYou are not being a good friend.", "I think it\u2019s an ESH for me. I hate trauma Olympics. It shouldn\u2019t be a competition and someone having a rough time should be able to vent. But I also think you need to read the room. Of course a twisted ankle and using crutches for a couple weeks warrants irritation and complaining. But constantly complaining to someone who is recovering from spinal surgery and in a wheelchair for months isn\u2019t the most sensitive move ever. The same goes for complaining about your vacations to someone struggling to pay rent. Consideration should be shown for a friend. \n\nIf she\u2019s your friend then she should be aware you are financially unable to do Christmas this year from just casual conversation asking what your plans were. Conversely, you should recognize that money stress is real at every level.\n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, it sticks out to me that she said they\u2019re in so much debt. She could have been living way beyond her means for years and now with interest rates and prices up she could be in a house of cards about to topple. She may genuinely not be in the position you think she is.", "Being grateful for what you have, whether in your friend's situation or in your situation, is always the best thing. I totally get how her being ungrateful for what she has is irksome to you. I don't think your TA; I think most would find that hard to listen to. If she doesn't stop after you've kind of let her know how you feel, if it were me, I'd either cut them off and change the subject to something else, or spend less time around them. I wouldn't end the friendship over it, I'd just limit it to something more tolerable for me. Best wishes.", "Soft YTA for the way you went about it but I completely get it. I use to complain about gas prices to my rich ex friend and she hit me with \u201cwhy even worry about gas, you have to pay for it anyway. I buy premium gas\u201d. No girl you don\u2019t buy premium gas. Your rich parents buy you premium gas. They just don\u2019t get it", "Tbh i don't think either of you are the asshole, but i think that you need to find different friends if you can't help but be envious. Or just kindly tell her to not talk about finances again because you're not comfortable talking about it. \n\nThe vast majority of money that people have are earned. If you're lowkey unhappy about your salary, you should do something about it. That doesn't invalidate her struggles though. \n\nI would think about your compatibility as friends", "YTA but I get it.  The thing is you need to realize it's all about all about perceptions.  Her life, while objectively is nowhere near as tough as yours, is changing and they are having to make cut backs - she has every right to complain about this as you do about your situation.\n\nI once worked for a company where the directors took a 40% pay cut during a recession to try and save jobs.  Now there were plenty of people that said well if I earned X i could afford to take a paycut, but the thing is people tend to live within their means.  So these directors had big houses, expensive cars, kids in private school etc and while yes it's more difficult to have sympathy for them than someone who needs to budget for bread and milk they are still entitled to feel the pain of the change in circumstances.", "I would vote NAH. You are probably right that she genuinely doesn\u2019t see how good she has it. No matter how good you have it, it\u2019s still scary to have to drastically cut back on a lifestyle you\u2019d planned/ grown accustomed too. You are definitely not wrong to be frustrated that she can\u2019t see your struggle is arguably worse and she\u2019s being a bit insensitive by complaining. It\u2019s good you pointed it out. Hopefully she will stop discussing \u201chow hard she has it\u201d in front of you. If she doesn\u2019t, then NTA and maybe pull back from spending time with her.", "NAH. There are people out there struggling to pay their energy bills. But for what it's worth, I don't think she was doing it to rub it in your face, I think she thought that both of you were in the same boat, which you aren't. You gave her a much needed reality check, and hopefully she's going to be much more self aware now when complaining about money around her friends.", "YTA and not having a conversation about the differences in your lifestyles and how they are affected by the each of your monetary differences was due long ago. \n\nWhy wait until your friend is having their version of a financial crisis to express how uneven your lives are? \n\nBy doing so your the one actually trying to \u2018play the victim\u2019, not them. Having friendships is based on open communication and not doing so builds resentment and leads to disagreements.", "YTA, but I wouldn't worry. You're probably not friends anymore.", "YTA\n\nYour financial problems are your own. You seem to find it unfair she has more than you but then again its not her fault she has a better life. One can complain about money and yet be 10x richer than the average person in Somalia or Venezuela. \n  You made her feel bad about having a good job, property and financial worries. She likely travels a lot because its something she values in life and finds it a priority. Not like she is a billionaire complaining about the payments of her 7th Ferrari. \n  You overreacted, seems like she didnt complain about anything to make you purposely feel bad about your own financial situation.", "INFO Do you ever complain about rent? \n\n>Meanwhile I have to rent, haven't been abroad in probably 10 years and almost live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nHow is that different than complaining about a mortgage? Where I live it's easy for rent and a mortgage to be the same amount.\n\n>How is she not rich at all, but has no problem lending me money?? I\n\nIt might be that she has just enough to be able to lend you some. My friends and I do lend each other money and none of us are rich. When we had even less we used to as well if could. Because sometimes you're just in a slightly better spot. Or the same place but someone's car got broken into and they can't fix the window.\n\nIt doesn't sound like your friend is trying to be mean. It sounds like she is talking about the same stresses that everyone has. So what would you want from her? She isn't allowed to mention anything but you can?", "If her husband has to take the bus to work because gas is too expensive, they aren't \"well off\" or rich.   Just because someone is doing better than you doesn't make them well off.  Your friend might have been insensitive to your situation, but based on your post it wasn't intentional nor malicious.  Also, if you never discussed with her how your finances were doing, she might not have even been aware of your circumstance.  \n\nYTA", "YTA first world problems are still problems to someone.", "NTA.  Basic good manners says that you don't complain to someone who has the exact same problem, but worse.  If you're skinny and trying to lose 5lbs, you don't complain about it to your fat friend.  If you're rich with mild money trouble, you don't complain to your poor friend.  \n\nThis shit is basic.", "NTA. \n\nYou're right in that inflation affects everyone differently, and the sacrifices Hailey will have to make will be different than the ones you will. \n\nI will say though in some fairness to Hailey, just because she's your oldest friends does not mean she necessarily knows 100% the specifics of your finances. She may have been shocked to realize that you are strapped in the way that you are.", "YTA, you\u2019re obviously a bit jealous of her, and that\u2019s fine", "I wouldn't call her well-off if she has debt (maybe not being American. I have a different world view). She may be living a better life to the one you are living, but that does not make her well off. As for holidays, there are plenty of deals available if you shop, right. I'm going to go with soft YTA for assuming. A lot of people live a life of show but don't have much to back it up. I don't know the tone used, but she could genuinely want to help you by offering money... the question is, do you want to lose this friendship over some petty jealousy that isn't even real as your friend isn't truly well off.", "YTA. She has the right to complain the same as you, if you can\u2019t be a sympathetic/empathetic friend that\u2019s on you, but she doesn\u2019t have to stop talking about finances bc YOU\u2019VE decided you\u2019re in a worse financial place than she is.", "YTA. Tuck in your jealousy it's showing.

Honestly, does she need a friend like you?", "YTA", "YTA. I get it, though.\n\nYour best bet, if you want to preserve the friendship, is realize that even if you'd love to have her problems, her problems feel very real to her. She's adjusting her lifestyle, it sucks, and she's venting to a friend.\n\nAlso, if you never really talked to her about your own financial troubles (likely, as she seems to not have known and then offered you money), she couldn't really know that her complaining was affecting you like that.\n\nApologize, have a discussion about what boundaries you'd like, and then move on.

One son died within the first few days; the other son died around 5 1/2 months. Our daughter was able to come home after 4 months in the NICU. Before you could be released you had to take a first-aid type of class that specifically focused on infants. We were in the class with around 4-5 other couples.\n\nOur instructor had to leave for a bit at the beginning of the class, leaving us all sitting around the table. One mother wanted to go around to talk about how long they'd been there at the NICU. She started and expounded for a while about how they'd been there 3 whole weeks and how awful it was to have been there so long. The other couples had been there similar times \\[anywhere from 1-3 weeks\\], and the first mom commiserated with each one about how awful and how long those 3 weeks were.\n\nTo say I'd been biting down hard on my cheek was an understatement. Three weeks? I'll admit I was thinking 'boo-freaking-hoo.' Try doing FOUR MONTHS. Plus, our other son was still alive at that point and we had even more time to go beyond that. When our turn finally came and she asked how long we'd been there, I told her.\n\nTo her credit, her eyes got big, and she got quiet for a moment. Then, she said, \"Well, that shut MY mouth.\" Part of me wanted to say, \"Yep, it did. Next time think of that before whining about your super awful three week stay.\" Thankfully, God really pushed down on me in that moment and reminded me of grace. Instead, I said, \"You know, it's just hard having a baby and having to leave without them. And it doesn't matter if it's for a few weeks or a few months--- it's hard.\" It didn't hurt to remember that one of the babies in our area of the NICU had been there around a year due to feeding issues. How could I whine about four months when that family had been there almost a year?\n\nYour friend needs to learn that while we may all be in the same ocean, we're not all in the same boat.

I know a few people who are similar to your friend- well intended, but kind of stuck in the bubble of their own privilege. It\u2019s frustrating. But, her feelings are her feelings, and she allowed to feel them and confide to you, as a friend. However, you were a bit harsh, even though I understand why. You should have talked to her and explained to her what\u2019s going on, why these sort of comments are difficult for you to hear, and ask her if she can tone it down a bit. It\u2019s not like she isn\u2019t allowed to complain, but it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask her to be a bit more aware of her privilege and the affect that her comments may make.", "Maybe you and your bf should look into pt jobs until you have more money set aside. Is your friends complaints annoying, 100% but I'm a single mom and when I need money I work more..I did 82hrs last week to make sure bills were paid, I had food and gifts for my son. I'm tired of people who are able to do more and better themselves but choose not to. If you have no kids why can't you guys get weekend jobs for a couple months?", "YTA...but softly as someone who struggles to balance everything, hearing how hard life if for my BIL and SIL who are in a lot more stable situation is galling.\n\nHowever that doesn't excuse how you went about telling your friend, despite it being understandable.\n\nIn many ways we are all in the same storm, we are all dealing with massive cost of living increases etc ... however our boats are all of different quality and some are less storm proof than others.\n\nYour friend sounds mildly self centred in not realising that maybe you are struggling more right now, but it doesn't mean in her eyes she's not struggling.", "YTA - you\u2019re not a true friend. A true friend celebrates their friends successes and supports them in their struggles. \n\nYou resent her success, I would probably secretly enjoy if she became poor.", "YTA. I understand your financial struggles but that\u2019s not your friend\u2019s fault.

Inflation IS difficult for everyone. Just because she makes more than you, doesn't mean that she isn't struggling. It might look like she has everything: a car, a house, etc...but those things also come with payments and maintenance. \n\nMy husband and I just bought a house, and my friend actively makes us feel like crap because it just the two of us and our puppy in our \"massive\" house, but her and her husband and 2 daughters are crammed like sardines in their apartment. Well....we found some problems with our house that's going to be a lot of money to fix...like more than what I make in a year.

Also, OP mentions her friend has debt. They could be putting all their holidays and extras on credit to keep up appearances and were ok making those payments before but now that inflation is hitting everyone they\u2019re starting to feel it; otherwise why is the husband taking the bus if gas is so expensive? Friend may actually be in a worse situation since it sounds like OP can at least pay all their bills just nothing much left for extra after.", "Yeah I agree with this. Once this divulge into the suffering olympics, you\u2019ve lost the plot. Because where does it end? If your friend complains that she broke her ankle, but you have cancer, does that make her ankle hurt any less? To be a good friend means to empathize with them, regardless of where your problems stack next to theirs. If it becomes unbearable, a respectful discussion can occur, but the way OP handled this was not it", "Im not sure if i'd even put soft in front of YTA. Being rich nowadays requires people to have an excess of cash. Her friend seems to be upper middle class, which is still worlds away from rich. It doesn't take much to realize that almost everyone in the country is having a difficult time right now. I think that it is a bit disingenuous of OP to claim to know how \"rich\" her friend is but not recognize that she actually has no idea what their finances really look like. Sure, they go on trips and have a nice flat, but that doesn't mean that they have tons of money in their savings. It doesn't mean they don't have money tied up in things that are unaccessable.", "The friend is probably up to their eyeballs in debt too. On balance their net worth is probably lower than OP due to debt.", "Her friend seems to have just been oblivious to the fact that her complaints about her own finances were upsetting the OP.", "Yeah inflation means that for everybody our money is worth less. Only the richest of the rich may not feel this\u2026 and tbh they might because a lot of time they\u2019re invested in many things with a lot of debt. But either way\u2026 it sucks", "Same. It\u2019s invalidating and quite rude.\n\nOP has poor boundaries and communication and she\u2019s making this her friends issue. If she felt uncomfortable hearing about her friends money issues, it\u2019s an easy fix to say that and end the conversation. \n\nIt\u2019s not the friends job read OPs mind like this. \n\nOP next time just say \u201cIm not very comfortable hearing about your financial issues at the moment because I\u2019m doing through a tough time too. Let\u2019s switch the topic.\u201d Then you\u2019d never have to hear about it again. \n\nYTA btw.", "This needs more upvotes.

She's a little entitled, but OP saying, 'How do you worry about money but still can offer me some' is such a broken way of thinking.

I hate it when people who are well off complain about not having it good enough. I completely understand snapping. I have had to explain to my partner that he is not \"working class\" or in financial duress, he's solid middle class. I think he gets it now.

Don't blame people for having trouble getting by. That's a bigger AH move than anything described in the OP.\n\nIt also reflects what might be the biggest motivating factor in the baffling set of YTA responses, which is the idea that the amount of money someone has is representative of their individual merit. If both OP and their boyfriend, as they say in response to this, are working more than full time and practically living check to check, that is a problem with their EMPLOYER.\n\nAlso suspect is the language others are using around \"trauma olympics\" and how \"it's all relative and there are people worse off than OP.\" \"Trauma olympics\" as a concept doesn't apply here. It's not comparing apples to oranges and saying my oranges are harder to deal with than your apples when it's literally a question of how much money you have, which, at a certain point, is a black or white issue. OP's friend is worried about being able to expand their lifestyle. OP sounds like they are worried about being able to keep theirs. One of those is harder than the other, full stop.\n\nOP's friend was being tactless and inconsiderate. OP is not under an obligation to placate their feelings in light of that. OP's friend should be able to talk about that stuff, sure, but there's a time and place. OP is not responsible for their friend's lack of self-awareness.

If someone was yelling or snapped at me, my first reaction would NOT be to offer assistance.  It would be \"don't fucking talk to me like that\" because I don't yell or snap at my friends.  \n\nIt is also so very likely that OP's friend doesn't realize OP's dire financial straits.  I have friends who I was surprised to find out were significantly wealthier than I thought, as well as some who were significantly less well off than I thought.

They might have been fine a 1-2 years ago, but the situation now is tenuous for everyone, especially if you were in the black but not by a massive amount.  Inflation has added 50% to our grocery bills in the last 12 months.  Gas prices have varied between normal and completely insane at various times this year.  Interest rates are through the roof, which for OP's friend is a huge issue considering how they do mortgages in the UK (no 30yr fixed option).\n\nYou also can't plan for everything - in our case, I've recently had to take on slightly over $10k in debt due to emergencies, one being an unplanned, out-of-warranty engine failure in my wife's car, and a major home repair.  Granted I was able to quickly apply for a 0% promo rate credit card in each case and cover it that way rather than draining our savings, but it's still a PITA to make the payment every month and cuts into our budget.\n\nForeign holidays are cheap in Europe - not much worse than me going to 2 states over for a short trip whether it be a beach town, mountain cabin, or a city for a weekend. 3 vacations could be anything from 3 long weekends to 3 separate weeks, and OP didn't specify which - it can be done affordably.  They also might not opt to take those vacations this year if money is as tight as it is.  *Edit:* She also doesn't know what sacrifices her friend might make to afford those trips that she might be indulging in, i.e. no/low frequency of eating out, carryout, alcohol, cannabis, clothes shopping, decorating, hobbies, etc.\n\nOP doesn't know their situation, she's just trying to win the suffering olympics.", "Would you know if they could typically afford to go on a foreign holiday?

I get that she's using it as example of the disparity.\n\nShe's complaining that is annoyed by her friend because she has it worse than her friend does, but her friend is complaining to HER. And my post was also using the same principle as an example of disparity.\n\nThe OP isn't directly complaining about not having a tree but she mentions it specifically to showcase her own financial struggles - which other people on this forum could look at and respond with \"Well maybe you're in a spot in which you can't afford a christmas tree, but i'm in spot in which I can't even afford to go grocery shopping.\"\n\nThe point is that it's relative and whatever hardship someone is going through can STILL be a hardship, even if it doesn't seem that bad to other people.
