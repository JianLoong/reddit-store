It's also 1000% bad form and poor taste to complain about money woes to someone that you know has it worse than you.\n\nThat being said, the troubles in a person's life are still their troubles. Maybe from your view point she has nothing to complain about, but it's all relative and there are millions of people across the world that could literally make the same complaint about you.\n\n\"meanwhile my boyfriend and I won't even have a Christmas tree this year and probably just skip Christmas all together.\"\n\nA lot of people won't even have FOOD today, let alone on Christmas. \n\nIf you guys are really friends, I'd have a conversation with her about how it makes you uncomfortable to listen to her money woes when you have it worse and then let it drop. Hopefully she'll be more tactful in the future, but it doesn't cost you anything to be empathetic to someone's problems, even if they're still better off than you.", "I mean you're not wrong, but it's all relative. Everything she's describing is legitimately stressing her out. Just because you have a much worse situation  than her doesn't mean it isn't also a  struggle for her. But you don't have to hear her talk about the woes of only being able to afford a four-day a holiday instead of a week. Probably bringing it up sooner, and in a calmer way, might have it helps navigate this before you lost your patience with her entirely. I'm going to say ESH, and encourage you to find a way to have an open conversation with her.\n\nEditing to add the thing is really you're both on the same side. She's comfortable, but she's not rich rich. She's not the enemy rich. In a class war you and she would both still be against the billionaires.", "YTA. I understand your frustration. I've been around people like her, too. But, you should've explained to her nicely your perspective and how her complaints made you feel instead of vilifying her \"ignorance.\" She sounds like she'd understand you based on your story.  \n\nAnd, inflation does affect everyone. It's a b\\*\\*\\*h.", "Have you ever heard of \"outside looking in\"? \n\n\nYou see what she shows the flat, her car, and the trips but do you honestly know her finances, do you have her bank statements? Maybe she's maxing out credit cards to have the lifestyle she lives, maybe her or her husband's parents are footing the bill...you just don't know.\n\n\nInflation is affecting everyone and she has the right to complain just as much as you do, so NAH.", "This makes YTA.  \"I told her that I'm sick of her constantly whining about not being even richer.\"  \n\n\nWhy do you even think it is OK to talk to a \"friend\" like that?  It is one thing to explain that you are in different realms when it comes to money.  It is something else entirely to rub her nose in those differences.    \n\n\n\"maybe she truly is just too privileged to see my point\"  This doesn't help your case.  If you were really a friend, you would simply call her up and apologize for starting the fight.", "YTA\n\nyou dont get to decide how bad other peoples struggles are. a recession is a recession. there were reasonable and respectful ways to tell her you didnt want to discuss money stuff with her without insulting and belittling her.\n\nedit to add: i find it ridiculous when people dont communicate something, then just wait until theyre extremely pissed about it and blow up on the other person and think theyd valid for it. you failed to once communicate you didnt want to discuss these topics, youre an asshole for erasing her problems and stressors because you think only you can be stressed about money", "YTA. She is too privileged to see your point? Nahhh, you\u2019re too envious to see how you are wrong.", ">She told me she had no idea I think of her like this and she can lend me some money if I need it\n\nInfo: Had you told her of your financial situation before this argument?", "YTA, when people play the pain Olympics, everyone loses. She could definitely be a little more circumspect, but I get the impression she's trying to connect with you and share what's on her mind. \n\nMy advice, genuinely, take a tiny bit of her money, let her ease your pain a little bit. Don't take like a giant vacation with it or something, but enough for that Christmas tree you wanted, or a nice dinner out with your boyfriend. You'll both be happier and feel closer, I love it when I can help out a friend and make their life a bit better.\n\n I'm doing well enough for myself but many of my friends are struggling. I take them out to eat, for a night at the pub together, with the understanding that they can probably never pay me back. But I love them very much and at the end of the night they can let go, and I feel better to see them happy. \n\nPoverty is a bitch because you will spiral. Even when you eventually get money your self worth is so crushed by society calling you trash that you ingrain that into yourself. You and your partner deserve to be treated like human beings, let your friends help you.", "YTA- Everyone being stressed over money or whatever it is is valid. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool for you to decide what someone can be upset over and what someone shouldn\u2019t be upset over. Yeah, she\u2019s in a better position than you but she has her own goals and such that she wants to accomplish just like you do. When you called the husband a \u2018poor thing,\u2019 that\u2019s when I became less understanding of your situation and less empathetic for you. You should apologize for your outburst.", "YTA - She may normally have a higher standard of living than you, but that\u2019s life and something we all have to cope with. You have a roof over you heads, and food in your bellies. A lot of people don\u2019t even have that much. Everyone is feeling the pinch at the moment, and while it is poor form of your friend to be complaining at you when you\u2019re less well off, it is equally poor form of you to be so jealous and bitter that her lifestyle is nicer than yours. It doesn\u2019t sound like your friend was being malicious, more that she lacked tact and consideration in this particular matter.\n\nBoth of you have a great deal to be thankful for. Perhaps you should spend some time this Christmas doing some volunteer or charity work, rather than being so resentful of your friend.", "Yta. All people can have money problems. Even people who look rich", "YTA.  I cannot stand people who play the trauma Olympics.  Unless you have seen their bank statements and bills and investments and everything else, you really have no idea what their financial situation is.  It just sounds like you are jealous that they do all of this stuff when you can't.  It sucks that you are having financial troubles, but that doesn't mean that her financial struggles are any less stressful.  And for you to minimize and disregard her feelings makes you a bad friend.", "YTA Everyone has it worse than someone. While you're lashing out at her about how you can't pay bills and likely won't have a Christmas, at least you have a home. You're focused on your own struggles just as she is focused on hers. Just because she has some things better than you doesn't mean she isn't struggling. \n\nVery telling that you lashed out at her when she opened up to you yet she instantly tried to help you when she realized what you were going through. Despite her own struggles, she instantly was willing to give up more to help you.", "If she has piles of debt - she might be in the same boat as you but doesn't realize it.", "YTA. Inflation is impacting all of us. There doesn't need to be a competition in terms of who's finding it harder.\n\nBut really YTA for the way you spoke to her. If you'd calmy and politely explained that you were struggling and found it hard hearing her complain about a holiday, I'd have said N T A. Instead you opted to be rude, and yet even then, she was still willing to try and help you if she could - I certainly wouldn't have offered to loan you money.\n\nAlso I'm going to be frank, she does not sound 'rich'.", "YTA. Everyone has struggles. You don\u2019t get to decide what is or isn\u2019t a problem for her. You should work on your jealousy. She seems like a nice friend if she\u2019s offering to help you out", "NAH. Just because she\u2019s wealthy doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t struggling with these changes to the financial landscape. Lifestyle creep is real, and these problems are real for her. \n\nHer repetitive complaints to you were a bit tone deaf and you naturally got frustrated. It would have been ideal to talk to her calmly rather than snapping, but what\u2019s done is done. \n\nJust apologize for snapping out of frustration, explain how you feel, and suggest that financial complaints be off the table for a while.", "YTA \n\nYou are obviously very jealous of your friend. \n\nYou are being grossly judgmental. \n\nYou are projecting your insecurities onto her and demanding what she can and can not discuss in front of you. \n\nHere is the reality\u2026\n\nWealth and privilege are relative to those who judge.\n\nTo a BILLION people around the world who live in abject poverty, YOU are wealthy and PRIVILEGED. Please think about that for a moment. \n\nYou are not being a good friend.", "I think it\u2019s an ESH for me. I hate trauma Olympics. It shouldn\u2019t be a competition and someone having a rough time should be able to vent. But I also think you need to read the room. Of course a twisted ankle and using crutches for a couple weeks warrants irritation and complaining. But constantly complaining to someone who is recovering from spinal surgery and in a wheelchair for months isn\u2019t the most sensitive move ever. The same goes for complaining about your vacations to someone struggling to pay rent. Consideration should be shown for a friend. \n\nIf she\u2019s your friend then she should be aware you are financially unable to do Christmas this year from just casual conversation asking what your plans were. Conversely, you should recognize that money stress is real at every level.\n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, it sticks out to me that she said they\u2019re in so much debt. She could have been living way beyond her means for years and now with interest rates and prices up she could be in a house of cards about to topple. She may genuinely not be in the position you think she is.", "Being grateful for what you have, whether in your friend's situation or in your situation, is always the best thing. I totally get how her being ungrateful for what she has is irksome to you. I don't think your TA; I think most would find that hard to listen to. If she doesn't stop after you've kind of let her know how you feel, if it were me, I'd either cut them off and change the subject to something else, or spend less time around them. I wouldn't end the friendship over it, I'd just limit it to something more tolerable for me. Best wishes.", "Soft YTA for the way you went about it but I completely get it. I use to complain about gas prices to my rich ex friend and she hit me with \u201cwhy even worry about gas, you have to pay for it anyway. I buy premium gas\u201d. No girl you don\u2019t buy premium gas. Your rich parents buy you premium gas. They just don\u2019t get it", "Tbh i don't think either of you are the asshole, but i think that you need to find different friends if you can't help but be envious. Or just kindly tell her to not talk about finances again because you're not comfortable talking about it. \n\nThe vast majority of money that people have are earned. If you're lowkey unhappy about your salary, you should do something about it. That doesn't invalidate her struggles though. \n\nI would think about your compatibility as friends", "YTA but I get it.  The thing is you need to realize it's all about all about perceptions.  Her life, while objectively is nowhere near as tough as yours, is changing and they are having to make cut backs - she has every right to complain about this as you do about your situation.\n\nI once worked for a company where the directors took a 40% pay cut during a recession to try and save jobs.  Now there were plenty of people that said well if I earned X i could afford to take a paycut, but the thing is people tend to live within their means.  So these directors had big houses, expensive cars, kids in private school etc and while yes it's more difficult to have sympathy for them than someone who needs to budget for bread and milk they are still entitled to feel the pain of the change in circumstances.", "I would vote NAH. You are probably right that she genuinely doesn\u2019t see how good she has it. No matter how good you have it, it\u2019s still scary to have to drastically cut back on a lifestyle you\u2019d planned/ grown accustomed too. You are definitely not wrong to be frustrated that she can\u2019t see your struggle is arguably worse and she\u2019s being a bit insensitive by complaining. It\u2019s good you pointed it out. Hopefully she will stop discussing \u201chow hard she has it\u201d in front of you. If she doesn\u2019t, then NTA and maybe pull back from spending time with her.", "NAH. There are people out there struggling to pay their energy bills. But for what it's worth, I don't think she was doing it to rub it in your face, I think she thought that both of you were in the same boat, which you aren't. You gave her a much needed reality check, and hopefully she's going to be much more self aware now when complaining about money around her friends.", "YTA and not having a conversation about the differences in your lifestyles and how they are affected by the each of your monetary differences was due long ago. \n\nWhy wait until your friend is having their version of a financial crisis to express how uneven your lives are? \n\nBy doing so your the one actually trying to \u2018play the victim\u2019, not them. Having friendships is based on open communication and not doing so builds resentment and leads to disagreements.", "YTA, but I wouldn't worry. You're probably not friends anymore.", "YTA\n\nYour financial problems are your own. You seem to find it unfair she has more than you but then again its not her fault she has a better life. One can complain about money and yet be 10x richer than the average person in Somalia or Venezuela. \n  You made her feel bad about having a good job, property and financial worries. She likely travels a lot because its something she values in life and finds it a priority. Not like she is a billionaire complaining about the payments of her 7th Ferrari. \n  You overreacted, seems like she didnt complain about anything to make you purposely feel bad about your own financial situation.", "INFO Do you ever complain about rent? \n\n>Meanwhile I have to rent, haven't been abroad in probably 10 years and almost live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nHow is that different than complaining about a mortgage? Where I live it's easy for rent and a mortgage to be the same amount.\n\n>How is she not rich at all, but has no problem lending me money?? I\n\nIt might be that she has just enough to be able to lend you some. My friends and I do lend each other money and none of us are rich. When we had even less we used to as well if could. Because sometimes you're just in a slightly better spot. Or the same place but someone's car got broken into and they can't fix the window.\n\nIt doesn't sound like your friend is trying to be mean. It sounds like she is talking about the same stresses that everyone has. So what would you want from her? She isn't allowed to mention anything but you can?", "If her husband has to take the bus to work because gas is too expensive, they aren't \"well off\" or rich.   Just because someone is doing better than you doesn't make them well off.  Your friend might have been insensitive to your situation, but based on your post it wasn't intentional nor malicious.  Also, if you never discussed with her how your finances were doing, she might not have even been aware of your circumstance.  \n\nYTA", "YTA first world problems are still problems to someone.", "NTA.  Basic good manners says that you don't complain to someone who has the exact same problem, but worse.  If you're skinny and trying to lose 5lbs, you don't complain about it to your fat friend.  If you're rich with mild money trouble, you don't complain to your poor friend.  \n\nThis shit is basic.", "NTA. \n\nYou're right in that inflation affects everyone differently, and the sacrifices Hailey will have to make will be different than the ones you will. \n\nI will say though in some fairness to Hailey, just because she's your oldest friends does not mean she necessarily knows 100% the specifics of your finances. She may have been shocked to realize that you are strapped in the way that you are.", "YTA, you\u2019re obviously a bit jealous of her, and that\u2019s fine", "I wouldn't call her well-off if she has debt (maybe not being American. I have a different world view). She may be living a better life to the one you are living, but that does not make her well off. As for holidays, there are plenty of deals available if you shop, right. I'm going to go with soft YTA for assuming. A lot of people live a life of show but don't have much to back it up. I don't know the tone used, but she could genuinely want to help you by offering money... the question is, do you want to lose this friendship over some petty jealousy that isn't even real as your friend isn't truly well off.", "YTA. She has the right to complain the same as you, if you can\u2019t be a sympathetic/empathetic friend that\u2019s on you, but she doesn\u2019t have to stop talking about finances bc YOU\u2019VE decided you\u2019re in a worse financial place than she is.", "YTA. Tuck in your jealousy it's showing.

Honestly, does she need a friend like you?", "YTA", "YTA. I get it, though.\n\nYour best bet, if you want to preserve the friendship, is realize that even if you'd love to have her problems, her problems feel very real to her. She's adjusting her lifestyle, it sucks, and she's venting to a friend.\n\nAlso, if you never really talked to her about your own financial troubles (likely, as she seems to not have known and then offered you money), she couldn't really know that her complaining was affecting you like that.\n\nApologize, have a discussion about what boundaries you'd like, and then move on.

Even with higher salaries, groceries are getting smaller, filling the tank with petrol is nerve inducing etc.", "ESH. I get being tired of listening to someone complain about money especially when you're in a hard situation, but you do not know what is going on behind closed doors she might not be telling you everything. I think you could have said it better and maybe asked her to stop discussing money around you instead of snapping at her. That being said, I think your friend was a little callous and not thinking when she was complaining. If you're close friends, which it sounds like you are, she knows that you're not doing these things and she probably knows that you live paycheck to paycheck. She comes off being kind of braggy with her complaints of 'oh I can't afford to do this extra luxury thing, that most other people can't do, anymore'.", "NAH, just people struggling in different ways. Yeah, if she is so well off she can have and do all those things, her money struggles are going to sound less dire to you. But it doesn't sound like she knew how inappropriate that venting was, and tried to help you the minute she found out, and that was telling of what kind of friend she is trying to be.", "YTA. I\u2019ve had people assume I\u2019m rich and accuse me of lying when I said I was not. They tried insisting my clothes were expensive and I laughed and informed them they were purchased at the thrift store on dollar day. Just because she\u2019d be able to lend you money and go on a trip does not make her rich. It\u2019s possible she is just good at managing her money and saves up for these trips, or puts them on credit cards. If she\u2019s complaining, it\u2019s obviously something she\u2019s stressed about. This all just makes you sound bitter.", "nta for feeling that way by yta for being rude to her", "NTA. It sound like you need to set a boundary about discussing finances. Let her know that your no longer able to discuss her financial issues and you won\u2019t be discussing yours. Let her know if she brings it up you will leave the conversation", "I would also add that it's likely your friend didn't even realize/know the financial situation you were in. I'm not sure how much you discuss your end of the finances but even with you yelling at her. Her first instinct was to help. She definitely committed faux pau but from what you've presented it's not malicious", "Boom. Came to say everything is relative.", "Also, I understand feeling offended at the offer to lend money.  But the way you described, it sounds like Hailey was offering out of concern for you and wanted to be a good friend.  Try not be grateful for the generous offer from a friend instead of seeing is as a slap in the face.  \n\nLight YTA.", "I see what you're saying but she's also not complaining to the people that won't have food about not having a tree.", "So shouldn't this be ESH?", "Agree, ESH. Also OP said that Hailey said they are in soooo much debt. Maybe all these expensive things are put on credit cards and there really is SO MUCH DEBT she\u2019s just down playing it so people don\u2019t realize or know. It\u2019s amazingly mind blowing how well people hide that they are in financial crisis by putting everything on a piece of plastic. I knew someone where literally every sent went to the purchase of the house, cars, and exterior decor and then inside they were sleeping on the floor because they couldn\u2019t afford anything else. Just purchased what they needed to keep up appearances. \n\nIt seems like the two friends need some better calming chats about things that bother them rather than letting them fester and blow up.

(Which is about 3.5 years worth of my salary, I think)\n\nShe is stressed about that, but at the same time, says they should have no problem saving (Edit: typo) up that money in the next 3-4 years...\n\nShe is just throwing around these insane numbers that seem impossible, but then goes \"oh, well, we could pay it if everything goes as planned.\"", "Right and most people live within their means, she may have more than you but that probably means her outgoings are more too so she\u2019s been hit just as hard, I\u2019m surrounded my people better off than me but we\u2019re all feeling the effects of the price rises, but I do understand you being frustrated I haven\u2019t had a holiday for years never mind one abroad so I\u2019d be pretty annoyed if someone was complaining they only get to go once this year while I\u2019m worrying about the kids freezing in a home I cant heat right now", "Read the room, OP is financially struggling. She isn't asking for money she just does not want to hear her sob story about how she doesn't have enough play money. OP doesn't need to look at Hailey's bank statement, Hailey flaunts her money in OPs face \n\nOP you are NTA\n\n>It sucks that you are having financial troubles, but that doesn't mean that her financial struggles are any less stressful.\n\nHailey is worried about vacationing while OP can't afford a Christmas tree.

Any number of them could be MUCH worse off than she is. \n\nThe point was that the issues here are relative - her friend is better off than her but that doesn't exclude her from having financial woes - even if those woes don't seem that bad from where the OP is standing. Likewise, THIS POST about the OPs woes might not seem that bad from people HERE in this forum that have it worse than the OP.", "Read what you just typed out back to yourself.\n\n\n\n1. You can guess all you'd like but unless you have unfettered access to their accounts you have no idea what their actual income is.\n2. Once again \"you think it's 3.5 years of your salary\" you have zero clue if it is or not.\n3. If they were so well off she wouldn't be saying that it will take 3 to 4 years to save up the money to repay the loan.\n4. As the other commenter pointed out if the husband is having to take public transportation to work because they can't afford gas they are not that well off.", "I didn't say they were the same struggles.  Please show me where I said that?  I'm saying that just because OP is struggling, doesn't make other people's struggles less stressful.  And that's simply a fact.

The difference between a real friend and OP is evident with OP's attitude towards her friend simply for having more.", "OP says that her friend has talked about having loads of debt.", "There is no \"if\" about it.

This too!", "She told me the exact amount they will have to pay back, I calculated it then and it came out to about 3.5 years worth of my entire salary.\n\nHailey and her husband can save up that much and some in 3-4 years. Meaning that even with their foreign vacations, every year they put aside more money than what I make in the entire year. I definitely consider that to be well off.\n\nAs for the bus, we are in Europe, most people take the bus, it's normal. Going by car to save 10 minutes of travel time is an unnecessary luxury.", "What you say is absolutely true. The shitty part is the complete lack of awareness being shown by the friend, who clearly has been living beyond their means.", "I disagree. Having your lower order needs not met is definitely more stressful than not having your higher order wants met", "This sounds like it was the straw that broke the camel's back. Perhaps OP could have been a bit more tactile, or communicated her distaste to her friend sooner, but it sounds to me like really bad form on the friends part. I would not complain about my financial situation to friends I know are struggling to keep the fridge stocked or the lights on. I have more debt than I should and it stresses me out, but I'm not on the breadline and I wouldn't be insensitive enough to complain to someone who is. If OP has to listen to her friend constantly complain about only getting 4 days in Barcelona this year when she's genuinely not sure how she's going to make it to the end of the month, I can see why she snapped. One of my manager's at work, who earns upwards of \u00a3100k (compared to my \u00a320k) often says things about how he doesn't know how he'll be able to afford to have another kid, and all I can think is 'how do you think the rest of us feel?'", "complaining about being broke while actually living very comfortably (just not enough to support an extravagant lifestyle) while your friend clearly struggles, and then when called out on it: immediately backtracks and tries to buy forgiveness. that\u2019s not helping, that\u2019s manipulation. \n\nhaving her friend\u2019s money constantly rubbed in her face probably wasn\u2019t a good feeling for OP and had had enough, then responded in a not so eloquent way when she finally snapped. could prior communication have prevented the blowup? absolutely. \n\ncomparing struggles is never a good idea, but having a little tact when venting to friends can save a world of hurt.", "OP didn't mention any lower order needs that weren't met though? Her examples were about Christmas while they are in different places on the high order scale, it's definitely not low order/survival needs?", "Again, I'm not comparing stress levels.  Why do people insist on making stress a competition?  I'm in no way saying one is more stressful than the other.  I'm simply saying that just because OP is struggling and is stressed about it, doesn't mean that OP's friend can't be stressed about her own situation.  I'm not comparing two people's level of stress.  If we're doing that, we could easily tell OP to get over themselves, because there are people starving on the streets so OP has no right to complain about her life.  But, I'm not saying that.  Both OP's stress and their friends stress are valid.", ">I would not complain about my financial situation to friends I know are struggling to keep the fridge stocked or the lights on. \n\nI think the key words there are \"I know\". OP has not yet answered my question about whether she had discussed her financial situation with her friend.

She said she's almost living month to month.\n\n>he doesn't know how he'll be able to afford to have another kid, and all I can think is 'how do you think the rest of us feel?'\n\nThis isn't about a rich boss guy wanting another kid, though.

It is extremely generous to be in debt and immediately offer to help. That's not backtracking. That's real friendship.\n\nOP had every chance to address it in a way that wasn't assholish. She chose the asshole way of handling it.", "where did this child come from?? \n\nthe friend is complaining because she can\u2019t take her 3 international vacations and will have to take her vacation in the same country", "If you\u2019re truly concerned with being able to afford something, you don\u2019t offer to lend money to someone else.\n\nThen you definitely won\u2019t be able to afford something.", "Some people value their friends more than a second international vacation or getting a bigger apartment.
