I was willing to hang out with both of them and have a good time so I agreed. \n\nAbout an hour before I was supposed to meet them, my friend called me and asked me for photos of what I planned to wear. I told her I was probably going to decide last minute after I showered. We were just going to a bar so I figured it wasn\u2019t that serious. \n\nShe insisted I \u201cdress down\u201d and asked me not to wear any makeup. For reference, I wear very little to no makeup as it is so I found her request extremely strange. At this point, I was annoyed. I asked her why she was trying to police what I wore and how I looked.  If she was uncomfortable with me being there, I could just stay home. I only agreed to do this because she asked me to. She apologized and said she was just \u201clooking out for me\u201d because I don\u2019t frequently go to bars and didn\u2019t want me to look silly. I thanked her for her concern and hung up. \n\nWhile I stuck to my usual makeup routine, I decided to wear a dress that I was looking forward to wearing on a date. I was meeting my boyfriend for dinner after drinks with my friend/her bf so I figured it was the perfect time to put it on. \n\nWhen I arrived to the bar to meet my friend and her boyfriend, she was immediately upset. She pulled me aside and accused me of trying to steal her boyfriend. I told her she was being ridiculous, I hadn\u2019t even said more than a \u201chi\u201d before she flew off the handle. She was stand off-ish the whole time I was with them but I had a nice conversation with her boyfriend because we grew up in the same part of town. I had allotted about two hours to hang out with them but I decided to leave after an hour.\n\nMy friend messaged me the next day and said she was extremely hurt because I decided to \u201cdress hot\u201d despite her asking me not to. She thinks I purposely tried to make her look bad in front of her new boyfriend. I said she was insane because I\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend for 3 years and don\u2019t want anything to do with hers. She is still extremely upset and won\u2019t talk to me even after I tried to make amends.", "created_utc": 1685314359, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13udm1g/aita_for_wearing_a_short_dress_when_meeting_my/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can\u2019t police you on what to wear.", "NTA\nIf she\u2019s going to be that insecure about having someone else around her boyfriend she shouldn\u2019t have even asked you to meet him.", "NTA, you can wear what you want. She shouldn't have forced you to wear what she thinks is appropriate.", "NTA. Your friend is obviously projecting here. You can wear whatever you want - little makeup, no makeup, TONS of makeup, who cares. What you wear should not matter. She won't have a boyfriend for long if she keeps hounding people she feels threatened by at every chance.", "She didn\u2019t want you to look silly by wearing makeup to a bar? Do you *sometimes* wear clown makeup?  \n\nNTA", "NTA, and that person is *not* your friend. She\u2019s taking her insecurities out on you.", "NTA 100%.  Your friend is being incredibly controlling and is obviously super insecure.", "NTA and your friend needs to seriously grow up. She's going to achieve exactly the opposite of what she's trying to with that behaviour. She won't have that boyfriend for long with that level of paranoia and jealousy.", "NTA. This person is not your friend.", "Didn't read past your friend asking you for pics of what you were wearing and telling you to dress down and not wear make up. No need. That's insane behaviour and I can already say NTA. If she's so worried about you looking good and her new boyfriend liking you more, that's her problem and she probably shouldn't be dating at that point.", "NTA - your friend is insecure. And if the bf if willing to dump his current partner because he finds one of her friends more attractive then he would suck too.", "NTA. You just showed up wearing clothes; she's the one who turned it into an issue. This is a her problem. She needs to grow up and get over her irrational and wildly unhealthy jealousy.\n\nI strongly recommend that you find better friends who don't cause unnecessary drama in your life.", "NTA your friend is clearly really insecure about her relationship but that's not your fault. Wear what you like.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault that she\u2019s self conscious (sp?), and you shouldn\u2019t have to dress down so she can impress her boyfriend or whatever the reason could be. Dress up while you still can, you only live once and don\u2019t dress down for anyone.", "NTA. This person obviously has an upending insecurity problem NOT ONLY in their relationship, but in their performance. Cut them off because whatever that was was ridiculous. Steer clear.", "NTA. You have a problem in that you have a seriously insecure friend,who sounds like she can be really hard work. She needs help so I wont call her AH,but Im not sure I wd want a \u2019 friend\u2019 like her in my life.", "NTA. Why you trying to make amends when you did nothing wrong?!\n\nShe's the one with the issue. Also your relationship status is irrelevant in this situation.  If shes thst worried about her boyfriends head being turned by a girl looking nice then she shouldn't be with him.", "Girl, please. NTA\n\nSo, she can't trust you or her bf? Sounds like she is not the kind of friend you need to keep around. How dare she try to control your appearance. The fact that she tried to make it seem like she was looking out for you just goes to show how comfortable she is at manipulating you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Amends for what?!?!? For dressing nice to meet your bf and having the gall not to wear a different outfit for meeting hers? Were you supposed to dress down, wear no make-up, meet her bf, go home, change, put make up on, and then meet your bf?  \n\n\nYour friend is the asshole here... okay maybe not asshole, but horribly insecure and taking her insecurities out on you.... no, on second though she is still the asshole.", "Sorry, I think there was a typo. Did you mean ex-friend? This is nuts. NTA", "NAH,\nShe was probably self-conscious, it looks like you are the prettier one.\n\nShe wants to show you to her BF, because you are her friend. Since they are a new couple, she probably had self-doubts.\n\nYou could have been easy and understanding where is coming from.\n\nShe needs to build her confidence and keep healthy with a counselling service.\nHow she dealt with was inappropriate bur that doesn't make her an AH. It shows she needs some positivity.", "I don't think your an asshole but if you are extremely attractive i can understand why she was mad. She shouldn't have asked you to come if the relationship had no foundation. It is considered rude to dress up when meeting someone SO especially if its a small group and you don't bring a date. I couldn't go to prom with a certain group because one of the girls was attractive to them and my date refused to go with them. None of the girls who went knew she would be there", "Obviously NTA.  Stop trying to make amends. Your friend is an insecure bitch. You don\u2019t need that in your life. She\u2019s the one that owes you an apology, for a lot of things\u2026 like telling you how to dress and accusing you of trying to steal her boyfriend.", "NTA friend is being extremely unreasonable here. She's gotta work out her own shit.", "NTA.  Your friend is crazy.  She's going to have a very miserable time of it if she gets this upset anytime a woman she perceives as \"hot\" interacts with her boyfriend.", "NTA\n\nYour friend clearly has some insecurities. Especially in light of the fact that you mentioned meeting up with your boyfriend later in the night.\n\nAre you close enough with your friend that you can ask her where her concerns are coming from?", "NTA - this woman is too insecure to have female friends or a boyfriend. She needs to work on herself rather than policing other people and trying to make them feel bad.", "If you still call her a friend, show her these responses. Most think she is insecure. Maybe help her get a better grip on her emotions, actions, and reactions. Time for her to grow up and mature some. No one better than a friend to help with that. Btw, NTA.", "NTA. Your friend does not sound like a friend at all. She is super jealous of you and incredibly insecure about her new boyfriend. No one should have to make someone else into something less than who they are in order to feel good about themselves.", "NTA\nYour friend is terribly insecure but also rude. Even if she believes her bf would be attracted to you why would she think you\u2019d be interested in her bf. I would keep her at a distance if I were you.", "NTA-but I would probably chill with hanging out with either her or her BF. It won\u2019t be long before the BF sees who she is and dumps her, so you should keep your distance for a little bit before this unhinged \u201cfriend\u201d blames you for that too.", "NTA. Your friend is exhibiting insecurity issues on blaming them on you. She might want to unpack that if she plans to be in a proper relationship.\n\nWhat if she takes him back to meet her parents, is she going to tell her mam to stop looking hot? (I'm working with a fiction where her mam is hot, mostly to prove a point about how she needs to sort out her problems that are definitely not *your* problems)", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is insecure af. Why doesn\u2019t she trust her boyfriend or you???", "NTA. Your friend is being controlling, insecure, and unreasonable. \n\nIn your shoes I'd pause on the friendship if she continues to be like this. That's not someone who's being a friend to you.", "op=NTA\n\nthat's some serious insecurities.  So unless you have a history of stealing her boyfriends, that you left out--this is a her problem.  Tell her that you are fine NOT meeting her boyfriend again, since she's afraid he'll pounce on you because you are so \"hot\".  \n\nBut overall, not much of a friend if she thinks that you'd TRY to steal her boyfriend.", "NTA. She is extremely insecure. If she trusts her boyfriend that little, she shouldn't be with him, whether her distrust is warranted or not.\n\nHer instructions were not clear that you were to try to appear less attractive (even if that were a reasonable thing to ask of a friend). They sounded like she just wanted you to be less formal, which is not the same thing.", "NTA - but she\u2019s clearly exhausting and controlling. Why waste your time? Find friends who can do adulting.", "NTA. She will destroy her new relationship with her insecurity. Yikes.", "NTA. She sounds like a controlling AH, and that's why her bf is going to bail (if he's smart), not because of the hemlines of her friends.", "NTA\n\nMy fellow ladies, I am so disappointed every time I see a post like this. We should be building each other up, not tearing each other down. If your man's attention is so easily swayed then why are you with him? He should only have eyes for you in that way. And if he doesn't, he can go pound sand.\n\nStop blaming other women because your man is a pig. Blame the man and dump him. There are better men out there. Don't settle.", "nta - rethink that friendship that she is soooo insecure and jealous of someone taking her bf when clearly u are in a relationship and she also sounds like she doesnt know u at all the way she behaves.  besides it sounds like i t would not matter what u wore or makeup, you hot", "NTA I can tell you right now your friend is going to end up alone because of her insecurities she'll project them on to the boyfriend...god help him if he has close female friends...", "NTA.  Your friend sounds insecure. If her new guy is going to stray, a dress or pants wouldn\u2019t make a difference.", "NTA. Your friend is insanely insecure. Don't try to make amends, you don't need a friend like this.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is beyond insecure - the world is filled with women and I would imagine at a bar there would be women who are wearing much more provocative clothing.", ">I had a nice conversation with her boyfriend\n\nIn your friends head you were probably discussing what you'd call your first born child. Insecure people ruin everything.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s absolutely jealous of you.", "NTA - is she always this insecure? If not the either the new bf is throwing off red flags she doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge or she believes you will steal all her boyfriends. Either way she needs to deal with that and it\u2019s not on you.\n\nHer doubling down and it being sustained over a number of days - and her still being upset - is just weird. I get being insecure but wouldn\u2019t you calm down afterwards when you left to meet your own boyfriend - and be embarrassed in the days after - not insisting you were right!\n\nWhether it\u2019s her or the BF - sounds like you\u2019d be better staying out of it - can\u2019t see that lasting unless they have some extreme toxic co-dependency.", "NTA and your friend is EXTREMELY insecure.

This is a huge red flag from OP's friend. I can't imagine any of my friends telling me what I can and cannot wear around their boyfriends. If the friend is that insecure that relationship is going to be rocky.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, I would have noped out when I got that text. I don't need that drama in my life.", "Since when is it rude to dress nice, especially when you are meeting your bf afterwards?", "whenever they decided its rude to wear white to a wedding. or just dress extremely attractive showing up the Bride", "WTF does that have to do with dressing up to meet friends at a bar?", "she doesn't want her friend to show her up. Yes only a terrible guy would leave someone to pursue their attractive friend, but it has happened and still does.", "If the guy is willing to do that, he's not worth your time. Ever!"]}
