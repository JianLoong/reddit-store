But carefully analyse neutrally.\n(People who lack depth and understanding,  cannot analyse, and those are the ones I need to thank for downvotes )", "And also telling them not to wear makeup, especially when they don\u2019t normally wear much makeup. \nI\u2019m also an older millennial and usually I have only discussed what I\u2019m wearing out with a friend to make sure we were both putting in the same amount of effort. (Because why should I wear makeup and look cute if she\u2019s just showing up in sweatpants?) Or if I\u2019m asking for an opinion on what to wear. I\u2019m trying to think of when I was younger and I can\u2019t think of any other reason. Wait, one more, if we were trying to coordinate on some level. None of these seem to apply here though.", "I forgot about the makeup part! I don't even know what I'd say if my friend told me not to wear makeup when meeting their bf for the first time. And yeah there are valid reasons to ask your friend what they'll be wearing when you go out, but this is not one of them! This person is not a friend.", ">most people simple don't invite their attractive friend to meet their new SO until its stable. \n\nYou must have some really insecure friends/partners if that is your experience.", "Why are you trying to make amends with an unhinged person anyway.", "NTA\n\nYou know what's great when you're truly in love? You only have eyes for your partner. Doesn't matter if 20 of the hottest, sexiest people on earth surround you, you'll only have eyes for your SO.\n\nYour friend is grossly insecure, which is a her problem, and she's wrongly taking it out on you. You don't need to make amends, she has her own demons to work on. Honestly, she owes you **and** her bf an apology.", "NTA. Even if she was your friend, she\u2019s not acting like it. Friends don\u2019t try to police what you wear, they might provide context about attire for a specific environment or location, but friends don\u2019t tell you to diminish yourself. It\u2019s unfortunate that she\u2019s insecure and is projecting that on to you.", "Definitely NTA OP.", "She is not your friend, who needs this drama? NTA", "NTA. It really isn't your problem she's insecure. If I were you, I'd have been tempted to dress up to piss her off lmao", "NTA\n\nDrop the friend. She\u2019s extremely insecure and, to be frank, prone to drama and outbursts. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to tell your boyfriend about this in case she turns\u2026unstable\u2026and then tries to sabotage your relationship.", "How good of friends are you? Does she think this guy is out of her league? If you are close enough and are invested in this friendship, you should sit down and have a conversation with her about her unhealthy level of insecurity and why she just wants \u201cfriend props\u201d to impress her boyfriend with.", "Your Ex-friend I'm assuming. NTA.", "You need better friends and you are NTA.", "Nta her insecurities are not your problem", "NTA.\n\nAnd you also need a new friend. Why do you want to be with someone so insecure?", "NTA", "NTA obviously but I don't think it's actually about you trying to steal him, even though that's her claim. She is deeply insecure so any woman she deems as looking nice is a threat. It's definitely in her and not really about you, probably if you dressed in a sack with no makeup and he engaged with you enthusiastically you'd have gotten the same tantrum.", "Nta. Why would you want to be friends w someone like that? You even gave her an option to back out. But she does not have the right to dictate what you wear. On your face or body. Thats so messed up. Then to act like your the one who did something wrong. Her relationship will not work. You cant have love without trust.", "NTA and ditch the toxic friend.", "NTA none of the excuses your friend gave you are true. The real truth is that you are probably better looking than your friend and she's insecure and jealous.", "What is she, 12? This is all very juvenile", "NTA, good bye is also a nice massage before sending her contact in your phone to the trash.", "ESH. Friend requested that OP come to the date looking like a train wreck so her boyfriend would see how much hotter she is than OP. For whatever reason, OP completely ignores this request and arrives looking hot af. No surprise, friend is pissed.", "NTA\nI only ever ask one friend what she's wearing when we meet up because our wardrobes are so damned similar that we've rocked up in identical outfits on multiple occasions. Your friend is hugely insecure OP and I'd be really wary of someone who can so easily flip out over a dress.", "NTA- she lied and patronised you to get what she wanted. You don\u2019t need friends like this.", "[removed]", "Like wear a dress to hang out with friends? What??", "Except the girl was demanding she dress down and not wear makeup etc before they even met so I'm pretty sure it's the girl being insecure as", "As another older millenial, I have desperately wanted to a photo of what other people are wearing to an event so I can know what to wear to match their level of fancy/sexy/slob but I know that's weird and my anxiety talking so I don't.", "See, I would love if a friend showed up like this.", "If she doesn't quite trust him, then he shouldnt be boyfriend. He should be \"this guy I'm seeing\" or \"the guy I'm dating rn\". \n\nThat's her problem that she's insecure enough to police you when ***she*** asked ***you*** to come and meet him, and it's her problem that she's desperate enough to give a title of commitment to men she thinks will skip away at the very sight of a pretty woman that isn't her", "I\u2019ve never heard of this ? This is really a thing ? I\u2019m 39 me and my gfs still ask each what we are gonna wear when we go to a bar or a show but it\u2019s to get an idea what level of dressing up to do. Doing it cause your afraid you\u2019ll be upstaged in some way is some next level insecurity.", "It\u2019s not like that at all", "I did analyze neutrally and my conclusion was that taking out your issues on other people makes you an asshole. Doesn't matter what issues you got. Seek therapy instead of taking it out on others. End of.\n\nEta: also icing someone out is still an AH move. Don't punish people socially because of your own personal issues. Communicate, apologize while explaining your issues, and seek help for said issues. \n\nI am saying this as someone with severe mental issues who used to have anger issues and would act the same way bc of my own insecurities, not with romantic partners but due to body insecurity. Being controlling and being an AH to your friends is not okay, no matter what issues you have. \n\nWhen I make mistakes due to my autism or depression or if my previous anger issues pop up, I admit my fault. I don't give someone the cold shoulder, I apologize. OP's friend needs therapy *but she is still the AH*", "Do you know why I am empathising.\nBecause I was in OP's shoes. Someone else was wrongly accusing me of being pretty and capable of getting anyone I want. When they said that, I felt how sad and broken they are inside.\nPutting my ego aside, I was compassionate towards them. To OP I said what I did. I personally do not like the OP's friend's behaviour which I said in first comment. I believe even wrong people deserve some compassion and benefit of doubt.\n\nIt's true, I could have ignored them and asked them to have some therapy. In retrospect, that does make sense. Also, I always show empathy even for bad people. Everytime I show empathy, I become unpopular. Does that mean world no longer  needs compassion.", "And do you know why I'm not empathizing with OP's friend? Because I was in her shoes just like you were in OP's shoes. Whatever issues her friend is having may explain her behavior but it does not excuse it. OP's friend is still the AH.\n\nEta: You can have empathy while still holding others accountable.", "Well. If you put it that way.\nAnyway Thanks."]}
