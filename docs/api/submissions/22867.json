If you would like to lower the price when you are at the home to include groceries then make it $5 a day per person.\n\nSo his family would be $2400 for the month. Trying to rent a place worth the same accommodation that would be a weekly price any where else.\n\nExplain to family and friends it\u2019s not about being cheap however having so many people rotating in and out the house is going to require upkeep. If they feel this is unfair tell them that you understand but it is also unfair for them to expect a free vacation.  I would also point out it is unfair to you to be taking advantage of. Explain this is the new rule but if everyone continues to have a problem with this then I would simply tell them that no one is allowed to use the house anymore due to certain family members expecting you to pay all the additional expenses and up keep on your house while they have a free vacation. You will no longer tolerate the entitlement and being taken advantage off.", "NTA. For a month stay I would also include the mortgage in the property tax for these cheapskates.\n\nI am guessing they probably likely caused more damage than other guests as they don\u2019t respect the gift that it is.", "NTA You should not be out of pocket for someone else\u2019s month long holiday. Let them be offended or just rescind the offer and let them pay for a holiday.", "Not wrong. Just say no to using your beach house in the future.", "NTA\n\nWhen you say bills you just mean water and ectricity right? \n\nI would send a group message to everyone what those bills are in an empty home for a month vs a month of them using all the electricity and water they want. Then I would say if you actuality believe that I should pay that $$$$ amount when I could leave the place empty and pay this $$ amount, do you all actually think I am going to choose the higher amount? \n\nAnd if you think I actually owe it to you to pay extra then we are not on the same page and you need to find your own accommodations. \n\n\nYou shouldn't even have to explain but if they are all ganging up on you like this I would set them straight.", "NTA. Pull out the bills from his stay and show it to everyone and ask if they would have paid it on top if their normal expenses as well.", "nta, airbnb the empty space and you'd make a small profit", "As a family with a summer house near the water...\n\nIt's one thing to cover a single week's utilities, it's another to ask to cover a month's worth.\n\nIn the scheme of things, they are getting thousands of dollars' worth of a free vacation (vacation rentals in the area I am familiar with start at 2k/week and go up), so covering several hundred for water, electric, and cable seems a small ask.\n\nTell them they are on their own going forward and look into whether there's a local real estate business that handles weekly rentals so you can rent out the house and cover some of your expenses.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nHe either pays or he doesn\u2019t stay, very simple. Tell him family isn\u2019t supposed to rip off and exploit family either, yet there he stands! Smh", "NTA. Tell your family no more use unless they pay for utilities.", "NTA have a set price for family to stay going forward to help woth things like this", "NTA!\nNothing is free in this world! And if he wants to use a house for his family of 4 then he has to pay for it, REGARDLESS if the place does belong to family. Since he doesn't agree to pay for his bills, he doesn't het to use ur holiday house ever again", "Nta. Tell him to pay for an rbnb \u2026 ask the family mmeon. His side to pay the bill because its not that big of a deal", "I totally agree - I can't imagine expecting someone to cover the cost of a month long vacation for my family. That's insane. I'm super close with my extended family but that would never fly with us.", "The invitation and also ban all of the family members who\u2019re bashing you guys. They are entitled and ungrateful,", "I would ask the ones berating if they want to cover their bills for the month. After all house is empty = 0$ , electricity and water while someone stays there costs.\n\nTell them how much is was last year for a month and ask for the money in advance if they want to provide said electricity and water for the family.\n\nOh and also don't invite nor allow the ones berating to step foot again in your summer house. See if you can use a firm to rent it out and care for it ( if you want) to cover some of the costs \n\nNTA", "Another route is to show them the utility bills from last year from the month they were there compared to the month the house sat empty.\n\n\"This is the real cost of your free vacation. I understand if it's too high for you to pay because it's also too expensive for my budget.\"\n\nThere should absolutely be a blanket policy that anyone staying there independently of OP's hosting should pay the cost of utilities and a cleaning fee, as well as damages. It would be smart to have a legal agreement in place \u2014 even with friends and family.\n\nNTA", "i only stayed there a few days before with them and I would help clean their house. As in like, deep clean with moving the furnitures and stuff. I only ever visit them in special holidays.", "Wow, so the cousin should get a free MONTH long vacation for his family of 4 but its okay that he balks at paying their own utility bills? Entitled much? OP is NTA.", "i never stayed in his house for more than 3 days before \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and I dont think I'll swing by again if he doesn't fix his additude", "That's what OP is doing. They sucked it up the first year and then realized how much it cost, so they made agreeing to pay the utilities a condition of staying for the coming year.", "The first time they stayed, there was no discussion of paying for utilities and OP didn't ask for anything. The second year when they asked to stay for a month, that is when OP asked - in arvance - for them to pay for utilities. This is my understanding, and if so, NTA. \n\nIF op let them stay, no previous discussion was had then op asked for money.... not cool.", "Yea it's a huge ask - its basically like a \"oh yay such and such can afford this and bought this place and we can take advantage of it\" perk. Nah. Not owed to you.", "Yes op needs to shut down the entitlement and quit letting family take advantage\nOf them.", ">u/One-Protection57\n\nHonestly, show the water bill to the flying monkeys and ask how much they are willing to contribute so cousin can still have his \"free\" vacation. \"I paid this bill for him to stay at my place last year. Since you think it is fair he stays for free, it's your turn to pay!\"", "Around where I am, typically there's a rental portion of a local real estate company. Even if the company you first call doesn't handle it, they will know who can and give you a referral.", "This is the easiest and most reasonable solution.  Show them the bills.", "That's not what I was trying to say. I agree with you that it's super entitled and asking them to pay for their utilities is absolutely fair. I was only suggesting that depending on the financial situations of both op and the cousin (a close family member) that it could influence the request. \n\nIf I was brok af and had a large family and a cousin with a summer home I would be so so SO grateful to be allowed to stay there. For free. And if the tables were turned, and I was balling out with a summer home and broke ass family who I loved... have at er. If everyone is in the struggle, paying for the utilities is reasonable.\n\nBecause it's family, the principal changes a little due to the financial situations. But like I said.... I could totally he wrong and an ah myself for thinking this.", "Like, would the entitled cousin have to save up to afford their utilities? That's what I was curious about. Again, either way... NTA!!!", "If he continues on this path, find out what it costs to rent your house and charge him the full amount, not just the bill.", "I was thinking more if they have some valuable furniture or stuff they want to protect in the house - and hence don't want to rent. But renting with insurance etc should if that's not the case be a valid option to help op with the costs"]}
