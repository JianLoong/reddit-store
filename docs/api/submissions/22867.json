Of course our relatives and friends came. We stayed there for a month, my aunts and uncles came, my other cousins, so did my husbands relatives. Of course we didnt ask them to pay anything because they stayed for a few days, besides they would help with the stuff like groceries. But one of my cousins asked me if he could have the whole house to his family of 4 for a month. I was ok with it since my husband and I only have a month off in summer so the other two months, the house was empty. We went back home at the end of july and the house was theirs until the end of agaust. I paid a lot of money for the bills those two months because since we get in beach/pool everyday, we take baths everyday, the water bill was higher than I ever imagined. I paid mine ok but to be honest paying my cousins water bill hurt me a bit because not only are they having a 100% free vacation for a month in our house but theyre also not even paying for the water and electricity they use. I didnt say anything though. But this year, I asked them to pay for it. since July was coming to an end they called me to confirm theyre comming and I said yes, if they would pay the bills. They were so offended and said it was inappropriate to ask such a thing, that he was family and that my family sometimes stayed in their house too. The comparison was different in many ways. We argued and most of my family took his side and called me a cheapskate.

Then send out a detailed email or whatever family uses to spread the news with the cost per day when the place is occupied for water, electricity, etc during the occupancy period.  July would be more expensive than October for example.  I'm betting they have no idea how much they are using.\n\nIn addition, look up the weekly rental rates for comparative housing at that location.  \n\nFYI - family does not take advantage of family, they make life better for each other, not use their stuff for free and then gripe when asked to step up to the plate.

But they invited themselves. They don't use water/electricity at home. But expect you to pay for what THEY use at your otherwise rent free summer house. \nThey're not even cheap at this point, but absurd moochers. \nDon't allow anyone to do that to you.

Your cousin is staying for a whole month. That's a month of 4 people using the electricity, the water, the pool, etc. They should be offering to pay, even if you refuse it.\n\nSit down with your husband and iron out rules as to how long and how often 'guests' can stay and what they are responsible for. Say something like 'while we don't mind having guests use our summer home, prolonged visits incur increased expenses. Therefore, we need to start asking that people start paying for the utilities if they want to spend more than a week at the house.'\n\nFree vacations are over.

He is way out of line by expecting a free holiday every year. It\u2019s not unreasonable to expect him to cover costs since you are letting him have the house for free.

You are letting him and his family stay in your summer house for a whole month for free, that is a very generous and kind gesture. \n\nThe least he can do is pay for the bills that he and his family use. That is not inappropriate or cheapskate, that is fair and reasonable. \n\nHe is not entitled to your house or your money.

From now on, if you stay there for a month electricity and water are on them.. no more freebies. The cheapskate is them  for wanting everything for free.", "NTA. I do not know why your family would say you are cheap, you are providing them and others lodging and only asking them to cover the bills of their extended stay not trying to make everyone pay for their short term use.  I'm positive the costs of water and electricity are a heck of a lot cheaper than renting a house or staying at a hotel.  I guess i would ask when you stayed at his house was it for a month and did you contribute to the household while there.  I do not think it is inappropriate for them to cover their costs as it is not on you to fund or partially fund their vacations.  IF your family is so dead set against it divide the bills up between them and let them know they can cover the cousins vacationing.", "YTA only to yourself.  The cousin is wrong but too late to ask for money.  You never made it clear that they were to pay for the utilities, food, and cleaning.  This is a lesson learned and one I doubt you will make again.

If you rented the house out to strangers, they would be paying a premium for full use of the space. Your family is being unreasonable. It\u2019s not your responsibility to foot the costs for someone else to have a vacation, especially since they aren\u2019t paying anything for lodging, and they are putting wear and tear on your property.

Totally reasonable request and you did the right thing and ate it the first year since they weren't anticipating paying.  \n\nTell them to find a hotel with a pool on the beach for the price of utilities.", "Nta. This is your sign to stop being so generous. It's a very simple and reasonable ask. \"I am not living in the house racking up the bills.
