He set a reasonable rate for use of the cabin, much cheaper than renting something not even close to as nice or as big, and that charge would offset or cover the utilities, taxes, mortgage, etc. There was a laminated list of responsibilities for opening and closing the cabin each trip, including cleaning out the refrigerator, taking out the trash, changing the sheets (and washing them and any towels used), cutting the grass, putting away boats, sleds, whatever. If you didn\u2019t take care of the property on your trip, you didn\u2019t get to go back. If you didn\u2019t pay the very reasonable (daily or weekly) rate to maintain the property, you didn\u2019t get to go back. If there was a scheduling conflict with another family, you worked it out between you and let him know who would be there when. If you went above and beyond \u2014 making repairs, painting the deck, etc. \u2014 he\u2019d often reimburse you for what you paid to use the cabin. That cabin was used by our entire extended family for multiple generations, and the cost to use it went up over the years because things do, but it was always going to be cheaper than a hotel or other vacation rental, and everyone in the family (for the most part) treated it like the privilege it was. But we also knew that when we were there, it wasn\u2019t like he was doing us a favor we need to feel obligated about until the end of time because we were contributing to it. \n\nEstablish boundaries NOW, including a reasonable cost for using your vacation home when your family isn\u2019t, so that no one has to feel like they\u2019re being screwed over in this scenario. You might feel like you should let everyone use it for free, but that\u2019s not realistic. Houses cost money to maintain and repair, utilities cost money, etc., and things change over time. You might not always be in a position to cover costs out of pocket, and trying to collect money later for past usage isn\u2019t fair or realistic. If your family is at all reasonable, they\u2019ll understand reality and why paying *something* to use your home is reasonable and contributes towards years of memories and relaxing vacations in the future. If you don\u2019t need the money right now, put it in an account set aside for repairs or improvements. Everyone benefits then. (And if they can\u2019t afford a full month at the rate you ask for, they can have a wonderful three weeks there and a week at home.

If the furnace wears out, you\u2019re the one who has to pay for it.  If the dishwasher breaks, it\u2019s your responsibility. It\u2019s reasonable to charge a basic rate to cover your costs and create an emergency fund for repairs you would not have incurred if the house were empty (replacement or repair of appliances in particular).  It\u2019s very much like using your car for work\u2014you\u2019re going to incur more repair and replacement costs because it\u2019s getting used more frequently. You don\u2019t need to charge market rate, but perhaps if your family had to put a little something into their stay, they might appreciate it more.  If they don\u2019t, they\u2019re welcome to rent an Air BnB and get a reality check.\n\nAnother poster suggested showing them the bills.  I agree. Screenshot all of the bills and share them with everyone, then tell them you\u2019re going to start charging a small fee for stays.

I would make them pay a small amount per day, like 20 -25 $, tell them it\u2019s for repairs, paint, water and electricity etc. Theres always something to repair in a house. Or tell them that you plan to rent it out on a platform.", "NTA\n\nIf you had asked them to pay rent or an overall cost, I would get them being upset. But you are just asking them to pay the utilities they are using. They should feel lucky.", "NTA.  It's a favor to borrow someones things.   It's an imposition to demand they fun you while you use them.", "NTA.  Now you know the problem with owning a vacation home, friends and family want to use it for free.  They are the ones that forget to turn the heat/AC off, cover the jacuzzi, don\u2019t clean up before they leave or do the laundry.  Even when they buy you dinners, gifts, food, or cook for you, it never adds up to what it costs you out of pocket.  They would be better off giving you cash to help cover bills.  It\u2019s time to draw a hard line with your family in a group text, \u201cwhen no one is at the house, the water bill is $__, the gas bill is $___, and the electric bill is $__.  That does not include garbage, maintenance, replacement of lost or damaged items, sticking basics in the cabinets such as slices and condiments, nor for our time to do the cleanup we have to do after you leave, etc.  When bro was there for a month, the water bill was $__, the gas bill was $__, and the electric bill was $__.  If you think that access to a vacation home without paying for the basic costs of you being there is unreasonable, do not ask me to use it. Go pay for a hotel.  This isn\u2019t a hotel.  This is my home.  I pay for a lot more than any of you realize.\u201d", "Tell them they can stay 5-7 days free, but more than that they need to pay water/electric, or since your family is siding with your cousin, stop sharing with everyone. Tell them you are renting it out when you are not there rather than paying more money you decided to make money.", "Staying with someone for a few days, is not the same as getting a whole house for a month. If they can't afford it, then they don't need to come, as it costs you money for them to be there. \n\nThat is the simple truth. You are just asking them to pay for what they use, instead of you haveing to fund their vacation. \n\nIf that is too much for them, they can get a hotel for a month. I'm sure that would be a lot cheaper...... /s\n\nNTA", "Nta. At all and your family is completely unreasonable. Tell them if they take issue w him using your vacation home, that you pay for, for free, for a month, every year, they can pitch in & pay 1/12 of the mortgage too", "Lol, the entire family is getting a free vacation off your property and you are the cheapskate!???\nIf I were you, anyone who sides with him would have No access to my property ever.\nYou didn\u2019t buy the summerhouse to pay the rest of the family\u2019s bill on top.\nNTA", "NTA. If they won't pay for the utilities that they are using, then they can find accommodations elsewhere. This is a very reasonable condition of using the property.", "NTA, tell him that's ok you don't have to stay there as I can't afford to pay for the extra bills he will cause you. Since he got the whole family involved to make you look bad tell him you decided to rent out July and are making a good income. Thanks for being so cheap turning down a free vacation home cause he didn't want to chip in for the extra utilities he was going to use.", "Honestly, not only are you NTA, I cannot imagine taking advantage of someone\u2019s hospitality in this way and offering AT LEAST to pay for water and electricity.", "NTA, and if he does not like it he can go rent his own summer home... and pay a LOT more for it.", "NTA\n\nBut you need a policy upfront-pay bills if more than 3 day solo stay, and a touch more for wear and tear.
