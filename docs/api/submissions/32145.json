You visited the hospital during treatments, I\u2019m guessing , so you did show support of your cousin during the worst time of their lives. Funerals are not for everyone for many reasons. Previous commitments or just not wanting to go to a funeral. A young persons funeral is the worst. I hate them but go when I can. When my husband and brother died we did not do funerals. Did more of a life celebration party and told stories so much better. No one should be shamed or trashed for not attending any funeral. You and fianc\u00e9 had a previous commitment that could not be cancelled. The family being mean are grieving and in pain. Try to give them some grace and space.

Grief does weird stuff to people, and, while it's not rational, the fact that anyone, let alone a family member, could have a party on the same day as their son's funeral must have been upsetting.\n\nConsidering how long your plans had been in place, and how far people were coming to attend your engagement party, not cancelling was probably the right choice, but I don't think I can fault the family members closest to the little boy who died for being upset with you.", "The only reason YTA is the way you talk about this funeral and your cousin. I think you've got some defensiveness about people being upset with you so you're in the mode of digging in your heels to justify it, but that's unnecessary.\n\nWhat if you absolutely loved this cousin and the situation was the same?  Your fiance's family all planned their vacation time and flew from around the country to be at your engagement party. YWBTA if you wasted all of their time and money.\n\nThe best thing to do would have been to find some way to have a presence at the funeral -- going to the viewing, or making an appearance at the wake in addition to going to the party.  Even recording a video to send to your grieving cousin saying how disappointed you are to be missing the celebration of her little man's life.\n\nWe all get at least one occasion where we are expected in two places at the same time in our lives, and we have to do our best with them knowing no matter what we're letting people down.

Of course you're an asshole. Your only justification is \"no one would notice if I wasn't there\" which is obviously a lie? You clearly just wanted to go to the party, so it's 100% right that your entire family believes you are self-centered and selfish, because you are.

In many cultures I have observed that when there is a death in the family, most celebratory events are postponed as a sign of respect and also some cases a bad omen. Is this a consideration for either you or your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family? Because it may explain some of the backlash.

That the event was months in the planning with people flying in was the main crux of the problem.  I mean you could try to ask the event be postponed a day.  That might have been possible or not.  I mean if the funeral and event were both on a Sunday it gets hard since people can't all just change everything with work, school, and flights. Depending on how your fiance's family are some of them could have hard feelings if you ditched since you are the main focus of the event.  Many would probably understand if given the rundown on the situation.\n\nI can definitely see how your family can be offended.  Would they have noticed if you had not said anything? Maybe. You offered at least a token of flowers and card. Here's to hoping people can get over it.  Some will.  Some won't.

A funeral is a good reason to miss an engagement party; an engagement party is not a good reason to miss a funeral.\n\nI feel strongly that if told you had to attend the funeral of a young family member who died after a long illness, your husband's family SHOULD understand. And realizing this event won't really be an engagement party without you present, there is no reason for their plans to change when it still represents a) a chance to see the bully grandmother and b) a family reunion. It sounds like your 'engagement party' was kind of being repurposed into a reunion anyway, and the happy benefit of that is that you being absent means they can still have the reunion part.\n\nI don't envy you, I think a cousin's child is kind of questionably distant, but you were close enough to visit several times. There's something just very off-putting and raw about ditching your grieving family to go celebrate your engagement, even if the timing was not of your choosing. Good luck!", "YTA\n\nPeople DO remember who showed up for a family funeral.
