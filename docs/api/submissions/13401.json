I know it would be easier for him and your mother, but you get consideration for what is best for you, as well. She needs to keep waiting for his payment and hound him if he is not on time. Not your issue. Refuse to take that burden on.", "NTA, at all. You're helping your Mom not your half brother. A million places will cash checks it doesn't have to be you.", "NTA\u2026 he\u2019s grown. He can get it together of figure it out on his own. We can only be our brothers keeper for so long before there\u2019s nothing left to keep. Can\u2019t open a bank account, the checks he gets are in your name, so he essentially has no income. Do what you gotta do for you, mom and brother will just have to understand.", "NTA. This \u201cmoney exchange\u201d situation could drive up your yearly income on paper (banks always report deposit activity to the tax authorities, wherever you may live).

He needs to take some control of his finances and find himself a bank account or at least a prepaid debit card he can load cash to.", "NTA\n\nIf he's late paying her how late do you think he'd be paying you?

It will only result in you not getting the rent money", "NTA. You have your own worries and bills, and are already paying twice as much as he is. He needs to figure things out for himself. \n\nI am curious: Why can he not open a bank account? I don't think even convicted felons are barred from banking, or the intellectually disabled. Does he have a history of negative bank balances or unpaid fees? Because if that's the case, then definitely don't help him, he WILL take advantage of you.", "NTA. \n\nIf your mom can\u2019t afford the rent because she\u2019s in mourning, she needs to see a grief counselor so she can get back to work. She can\u2019t permanently rely on her children, to pay the rent. I know it\u2019s harsh, but you had an agreement, and it doesn\u2019t change just because.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult with responsibilities and so is he. You are under no obligation to sort out his problems.\n\nIf you're given more grief over it when the time comes, I'd probably leave or threaten to leave, that way they will get the memo. You don't deserve to be guilt-tripped like that, considering you pay the majority of the rent too.", "NTA. Your brother doesn\u2019t want to get busted by not paying taxes and working under the table. You need to protect yourself, OP.", "NTA He's paying only 33%? Surely he can handle that. You have your own bills to take care of. Why must you also take on your brother's as well. Your mother went to the wrong person. She needs to go to your brother.", "NTA. Keep your boundaries.  They are reasonable.  You are responsible for paying your own bills, and part of that is ensuring that you work to stay out of positions that put you in danger of not being able to pay.", "NTA, and start preparing to move out.  Your mother is enabling your brother and participating in him taking advantage of you.\n\nStop accepting cheques for your brother.  That may be being reported as your income, which could have tax implications for you.  He can have them made out to him and go to a cheque cashing place, or he can get an actual job.  I don't know why he can't open a bank account, but that isn't your responsibility.", "NTA. \n\n1. Your brother could let your mother deposit his pay and she can pay him the difference\n2. Even if he can't open a bank account, he can probably open a credit union account.\n\nThere's no reason for you to get involved in any of this.", "NTA and why are you paying double the amount your half bro is.  Just because you make more money should not mean you should pay more to support him.  You are his sibling not his parent.  If your mom wants to support him then she should but not at your expense.  It's not like she is in dire financial straits, it should be the same amount from both of her kids.", "NTA. You have an agreement, your brother needs to uphold his end of the deal. If you pay everything, they will then turn around and say \u201c you ve been paying it all this time, you can just continue \u201c. Don\u2019t let this slide- they are attempting to take advantage of you. You have the power to stop it.", "NTA.  Of course he won't pay you back.  Is that okay with you?", "NTA\u2026do not do it.  Your mom wants you to be responsible for your brother and that is not your job.  She wants you to pay his rent because she knows you will not be late.  Again not your problem.  Tell mom she has to set her own boundaries with her son because if she pushes this on you, you will move out into your own place and she will be back at square one.", "NTA.  He can get a cash app or other cards his money can be loaded on to.", "NTA!", "Rule of thumb: don't be a middleman unless you're being paid for it.\n\nDon't get in between your mom and brother financially. Mom wants you to be the buffer so that you, not her, absorb your brother's financial instability.\n\nSecondly, stop facilitating your brother's under the table job. If he wants to work illegally, that's his risk. By facilitating it, you're almost certainly doing something illegal yourself. That's stupid. You're putting your future at risk.\n\nYour brother appears to have issues that he needs to sort out. Right now you are enabling him. Stop it.", "I don\u2019t feel obligated to help because he\u2019s never really been in my life. If he didn\u2019t live with me, I wouldn\u2019t have any interaction with him. My ex got on me about not wanting to help him and called me a bitch for it. I dumped him fast.", "I had a feeling that would be the case\u2026 Just curious, is there a source that you can cite?", "My mom is comfortable financially, but wanted us to \u201cpay rent\u201d. I\u2019m fine paying just my portion and mine only.", "If they're in their 20s, I'm not sure their mom would count for elder support unless she was old when she had them?", "No one knows why he can\u2019t make an account and he refuses to disclose that information. \n\nHe technically isn\u2019t freeloading\u2026", "She pays for everything else, water, electricity, internet, gas, etc. She owns the house.", "She\u2019s retired and owns the house. Mortgage is paid from the rent that my brother and I pay. My mother pays for everything else, such as the electric, water, internet, and any other bills that come in.", "This is the answer.", "OP is participating in tax fraud. This could lead to some very bad things if the staff at the bank start to have suspicions.", "I\u2019m trying to sort through all of the links related to the IRS (here in the USA) info, but it\u2019s too confusing, Lol. That\u2019s why I used a question mark. I do know that there are taxable income exceptions\u2014like a \u201cgift\u201d of money, which is not held against you if it\u2019s under $10,000.00.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to continue to keep up this arrangement with your brother (for whatever reason you deem appropriate for yourself), you could always send this concern about tax liability up the flagpole as the reason you will no longer do it. I **highly doubt** your brother will spend hours or days researching the tax codes (nothing but labyrinthine mumbo jumbo) to verify whether you\u2019re right. Just stand your ground and put an end to it. It\u2019s so easy to blame the IRS and make Uncle Sam the bad guy, Lol. Good luck! \ud83d\udc4d", "Funfact: if your brother can't get a bank account, the check can still be made out to him and he can cash it at Walmart. Or he can be paid via a prepaid debit card, like my dad who no longer trusts banks.\n\nI don't think a bank account is the issue. It sounds like he owes money and would have his wages garnished were he not being paid under the table. That, or the employer wants to go around the IRS and they're using the bank account nonsense as an excuse. Either way, it's not your problem. Stop handling his paychecks and tell him to work it out", "Ew. Sounds like you should look for other options moving forward if she's going to practice unfair landlording.", "What portion of the rent is your mum paying and why are you paying twice what your brother is paying? That seems quite unfair to me", "Could he open a bank account without a valid ID?", "I make significantly more than he does. But it\u2019s only enough for me to live off of.", "No, but he also shouldn't be able to get a job without one, either.  He wouldn't be able to cash a check, but he could still be paid via debit card. Still not your problem lol", "It still seems quite unfair to me. In fairness, I come from a place where rent would be divided equally among tenants, so I dont understand why your brother is being treated differently and why your mother isnt paying her way also....\n\nDont pay anyone elses bills other than your own. And maybe think about moving (if it's an affordable option)"]}
