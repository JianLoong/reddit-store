We needed a place to stay as I could not work during the end of my pregnancy and my son couldn't start daycare until 12 wees. \n\nMIL and I have never had a good relationship, but she said she would help us and said she had talked to her boyfriend and we could stay with them. i know this was a huge sacrifice. She isn't that stereotypical doting grandma and I know she is in no way enjoying having a baby in the house. I really appreciate this from the bottom of my heart. \n\nI do what I can to help around the house and to not be a burden. We don't pay any rent as she told us they don't need it and just save. The other day MIL told me she found a Tiffanys receipt for an engagement ring in her boyfriend's things and was going to find it. She asked me to help her, and I told her she shouldn't snoop. she called me boring and went to do it.\n\nMIL destroyed their bedroom. She emptied out every drawer, went through all of his clothes, and every shoe box. I'm not even kidding when I say this man probably has 40 pairs of shoes and she took every box down and didn't put any back. He was not happy when he came home, but MIL just tried to act ditzy and pretend it was not a big deal. The ring was in a safe and he told her she can have it when she cleans the mess. MIL refused but somehow persuaded him to open the safe.\n\nHe told her that she was not leaving that mess for his housekeeper (she's worked for his family since he was a kid and is kind of like a grandma figure, so he didn't want to leave her a huge burden) MIL tried to tell him he should clean half because it is his room too. Finally she asked me to clean it. I said I wasn't cleaning a mess she made and that I don't mind doing chores, but she tore their bedroom apart and I shouldn't have to fix it. \n\nMIL snapped at me that I'm ungrateful and should do it since I don't pay rent. My husband chewed her out. It's been a week and their room still looks like that. Her fiance has been putting stuff away little by little, but MIL complained to her brother who agreed I owed it to her.", "created_utc": 1668200176, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysmv8p/aita_for_refusing_to_clean_mils_bedroom_though/", "score": 186, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope y'all get away soon.", "NTA, you don't have to clean up the room of a woman who behaves like an inpatient toddler just because she doesn't want to do that herself. You live there for free, you help around the general household, yes - but you don't have to be a houseslave to someone who trashes up the house on purpose.", "Why would you even move in with this kind of person?  Ugh. Since you did, and you're not paying anything, I would have a least offered to HELP her, not do it all yourself.  She has to take responsibility of her own stupidity.

That she had the nerve to expect you to jump up and clean her mess is ridiculous. There are some boundaries that are unspoken but pretty much understood and she tried. She needs to take the L.

I would honestly have helped her pick up her room, laughing the whole way.

Shes throwing a adult temper tantrum of 'I'm not doing it till you give me it first'. I wouldn't clean it either, even a toddler knows to help put their toys away when they've destroyed their room. \n\nIts not your room your staying in, it's not a common area.

She\u2019s still a child herself.", "So normally I'd say it's not a huge deal to do her a favor, but it bugs me that she's throwing the rent in your face when she's the one that declined it in the first place. It'd be one thing if she changed her mind and asked for rent after all but it strikes me as underhanded to decline and then try to leverage it after the fact. Moreover, it's her mess in her private space. NTA", "Lol, her boyfriend tried thet saying he'd give her the ring and it didn't work", "NTA. What makes you the magical cleaning fairy and not her son?"]}
