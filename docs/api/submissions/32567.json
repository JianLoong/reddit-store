My boyfriend (22M) has been out of a car for the last few month after his old one broke down. He hasn't been able to afford a new car and for Christmas his grandparents are giving him $10k for a down payment on a car. He had his eyes set on a used 2017 car that would have cost him around $250 a month. However, someone ended up buying that car and I told him that while it sucks, there's other cars and I'm sure he would find one he wants. He said that was the only car he wanted and if he couldn't get that car, he wasn't willing to get any car at all. Then I ended up asking him how he was going to keep getting around then since he's been relying on everyone he knows for rides for the past few months (Myself included, and I live 20 miles away from him so it's been expensive for me gas-wise). \n\nHe never responded to me and instead a few hour later he said he was going to buy the same model, just a newer year (2023). He told me it would cost him around $500+ a month and it wouldn't be a big deal. Meanwhile, he doesn't have his first 'real' job (he currently works at a retail store which no hate but the pay isn't great). We were also planning on moving in together sometime after he graduates from college next semester. I told him that would be a bad idea because it's incredibly expensive and he doesn't know where he'll be in the next five years to justify a big spend like that. I asked him about our plan to move in together and he pretty much blew up at me and kept emphasizing that that is 4 months from now and that he'll \"figure it out\". He said he'd get a real job by then and he'd figure it out. He told me to hop off his dick and that the consequences would be his and I wouldn't have to deal with it. I told him that if we were planning on moving in together anytime in the next year or so I definitely would have to deal with it, especially if he can't find a job to afford the car, let alone rent. \n\nHe told me to stop treating him like a child, and I told him to stop making childish decisions when he has no guarantee of if he'd be able to find a good job after he graduates (he's been applying to jobs in his major for months and has yet to receive an interview, which I get is life and it sucks but it's the reality). I told him he has to start acting like a grown up and a different car wouldn't be the end of the world and most 22 year olds don't just get the first car they want just because they want it. He said he would start acting like an adult on his own time and I let him know that he is an adult right now.\n\nI just don't know what to do. I know I can't make him buy a different car and in the end it's not my decision but it's something I have to worry about if we ever plan on living together. I'm worried that by the time we move in together, he's going to go off and make some other irresponsible financial decision and I'll be left to pick up the pieces (rent, general expenses, etc.) Am I the asshole for being against this decision and calling him childish?", "created_utc": 1701991363, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18d8oqv/aita_telling_my_boyfriend_that_buying_a_brand_new/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He absolutely could buy a used car for $10k. Ultimately though, he\u2019s an adult and can make dumb decisions if he really wants to. BUT you are also an adult and can still make smart decisions and not move in with this man. \n\nI bet you he hasn\u2019t even looked up what the monthly car insurance on this car would cost. Anything with a loan needs full coverage. Unmarried male under the age of 25? That\u2019s gonna be rough! Hope he doesn\u2019t have any speeding tickets or accidents on his record! \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t have much credit history then he\u2019ll also have a ridiculously high interest rate and the next thing he knows at least half his salary is going into a car that can\u2019t feed him or pay his bills and the only roof it\u2019ll provide him is if he\u2019s living in it. (Which he might just end up doing if he can\u2019t afford anything else)\n\nDON\u2019T CO-SIGN ANYTHING FOR THIS MAN. He will wreck your credit.", "NTA\n\n> most 22 year olds don't just get the first car they want just because they want it\n\nFuckin' a.\n\nDude can *aspire* all he wants. But he has to live with **what he can _afford_**.", "NTA and please reconsider moving in with him. He doesn\u2019t seem to have a grasp on finances.", "NTA. you might want to start planning to get some roommates or live on your own until this guy can prove to you he's smartening up about his financials, you really shouldn't mix yours up with his or you'll be paying for his bad decisions or wind up where you really don't want to be.", "NTA - so don\u2019t plan on living together. Put a pause on that. Let him sink or swim the hard way.\n\nCan he even get approved for a car loan? Don\u2019t co-sign for him. In 4 months time when it\u2019s time to do Apartmwnt shopping, is he still struggling to pay everything? Can he even afford rent with his current job?\n\nThe whole \u201cill act like an adult on my own time\u201d would make me pause the relationship altogether. I don\u2019t date children.", "NTA. There are plenty of reliable, decent used cars that are more affordable. He's being dumb and short sighted. You tried to make him see reason, but he doesn't want to and that's on him. You're right to be concerned if you are to live together. You've said your peace and now it's his decision, but that means that you have a decision to make too. It sounds like he has some major maturing to do. I'd be reconsidering the future if he does go through with the purchase.", "NTA but as you said you can't make him not buy the car. You can however take note of his bad financial decisions and extract yourself from them so he doesn't ruin you financially either.", "NTA. Im 39 and drive a $250 beater car because it makes sense for just eating up miles on my commute. My wife has a nice vehicle for when we go anywhere else. He wants the expensive Honda, but all he really needs is something to get him around. He could take that 10k, buy a basic 2k used car and have 8k left over for whatever pops up", "nta but also all jobs are real jobs drop this not a real job bullshit its classiest as fuck", "NTA. You were giving sound advice, which is what couples do for each other. And he\u2019s acting childish.", "Let him make a grown up decision. Grown up consequences will teach a lesson.", "Well, don't move in together", "NTA but also right now is the absolute stupidest time to buy a new vehicle at all (if in the US)", "NTA\n\nI think people really struggle to identify between wants and needs sometimes. It\u2019s so hard to try point people in the right direction or what you believe to be the right direction. I\u2019m absolutely guilty of it myself, always pushing my partner to make better financial decisions so that we can both benefit in the future and bring equal amounts to the table. But sometimes you gotta just let them make the mistake and they\u2019ll either realise their fuck up OR they\u2019ll prove you wrong. \n\nBut I do still think he should compromise on the expensive car and don\u2019t blame you for being upset by it.", "NTA. Don\u2019t move in with him", "Nta but you can\u2019t force anyone to do anything. If he is going to be that immature then let him. You can\u2019t do anything but voice your opinion and hope he takes the advice. The real question is though, is this what you want to put up with for the rest of your life?", "Remind him that the 500 a month is not his only expense.  He will need fun coverage on the car. With him being young and the car being expensive, that's gonna cost a bit. Also things like registration are more expensive with a nicer car.", "NTA but clearly you need to put a stop on plans to move in together. Unfortunately, you can't force someone to make good financial choices, you can only insulate yourself from the fallout.\n\nStop giving him rides since he's not even trying to help cover your increased costs. You need to make it crystal clear *now* that you're not going to help him with rent, car payments, etc. if he gets this car, and you will require proof he can afford all that AND rent before you'll even consider discussing living together.\n\nWhile it might feel crappy to do, he's making a financial choice you wouldn't be able to justify. There's no reason for you to get dragged down. The job market sucks right now, and depending on his field, getting a job may be very difficult. On the other hand, if he does get a good job and is making a lot of money, it won't be any issue. It's best to just require proof he can afford his bills before you let him move in.", "NTA. But SERIOUSLY question whether you want to sign a lease or split bills with this person. Getting involved in joint financial decisions is BIG step and it needs to be discussed at length to make sure every is on the same page.", "NTA. New cars are WAY overpriced these days & depreciate so rapidly you're better off buying a newer used car.", "So you wouldn\u2019t have been if you just gave him your opinion with logical reasoning. I am not saying he was not wrong as well but you could have supportive and suggested that in a year or two you work up to a new car (positive goal).\n\nYTA for taking it further to call him childish and belittling his decisions. Your argument probably caused him to dig in his heels and you shit all over his future job prospects even if it is reality. It\u2019s hard but a sometimes people need to fall flat on their face to learn from their mistakes.", "Working retail isn\u2019t a real job? Is he just volunteering? Retail is typically low paying but according to the pandemic, retail workers are essential to our society \n\n\nI do think you\u2019re treating him like a child", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, your advice is **correct**! Someone without a job should buy a used car, not a new one. However, you only get to tell him once or twice before you become an asshole. I went back and forth on whether you were an asshole or not, but it seems to me that you crossed the line with your comment about \"stop making childish decisions.\"\n\nI know you were worried about how this might affect you **when** you move in together, but actually, you should use this to help decide **whether** to move in together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can't make his decisions for him. All you can do is make the right decisions for YOU. At this point, in my opinion, he's not in a financial position to move in with you. Why are you even considering this? Btw calling him childish isn't going to help either, it just creates more issues. Perhaps sit down and tell him that while you do want to live together with him you both need a financial plan in place. When you both (him) have completed certain goals THEN you would be willing to live with him, but not until you are both financially strong enough.

Savers rarely turn into spenders and spenders rarely turn into savers.  People usually stay who they are, so trust them when they show you. \n\nYou're finding out that your bf is not at an adult level of financial responsibility. I'm not saying to dump him, but you should ask him to meet with a financial advisor with you before he buys the car.  Sit down and look at what saving for a house, kids, and a retirement looks like.  Do the math to show him how much richer he'd be in 30 years if he bought a 10k used car and put the $500 a month into an S&P index fund. \n\nIf he sees the future he's pissing away for a car and still wants it, you'll know that this isn't someone you want to rely to combine lives and finances with. \n\nNTA. Financial compatibility is not optional in a relationship.\n\nEdit to add some bonus math. Assuming 30 years @ the worst 5 year return the S&P has had in the last 30 (7.5%): If bf puts $500 into an index fund, then puts $500 a month for the next 30 years, when he's 52, he'll have $650,000. \n\nYes, I know he won't have car payments for 30 years.

Maybe, he might be able to pay the monthly payment, as long as the car is doing fine. Maybe, the normal services are covered, too. But what if he has an accident and the insurance doesn't cover? Can he pay for the repairs? What, if he loses his current job before he finds another and is unemployed for some time? Can he still pay the leasing stuff?", "NTA. Your situation reminds me of my situation 15 years ago. It took me 5 years to claw my way out of debt that \u201cwasn\u2019t my problem\u201d. If you think he has a shot at making these payments, maybe start with a 3-6 month lease which is within your means to pay individually if he proves to be irresponsible.

But he needs to see the pros and cons of having a car with a 500+ price range it even hurts me to even pay that and that\u2019s what I\u2019m currently paying for my 2019!

He doesn't have any tickets that I know of but once got into an accident with my car because he backed out of a parking space without looking and another car hit mine (which I was furious about). He insisted (and still does) it wasn't his fault because they were on the wrong side of the road except it was a narrow parking lot and it was definitely his fault.

These jobs are usually harder than many other jobs that pay more. I explained that I just meant it doesn't pay well, which it doesn't. That's the truth.

The only thing is that I only mentioned that he's been applying to jobs for months on here for context. I never told him he wasn't going to find a job, just that currently it wasn't guaranteed because he's still in school and doesn't have the degree yet, and it's super hard to find a job in his field right now.

It definitely is making me reconsider moving in together, however.", "Yeah, I know I shouldn't have called him childish because it didn't help the situation. I was just so heated. That's on me. Thing is, we had a plan in place to save up money for a security deposit, first and last, and some extra in case of anything unexpected. We weren't going to move in together until he graduated and got at least an entry level job somewhere but this kind of throws a wrench in all that. I mean this was out of nowhere, he can be stubborn but hasn't really been one to just go around spending his money willy nilly (At least not that I know of, I obv don't keep track of his money or anything).

It's all good, just nice that this didn't go wayward like so many Reddit interactions. :) Trust me I hate it when people shit on retail jobs too because it is hell for the pay that you get.

At Michaels, I had someone bring their dog in a cart and let the dog drip diarrhea all over the store and just put the cart back in with all the others. Not the worst stories I have, but definitely some of the grossest.  Oh, during the pandemic (ish) I had a customer come into my Starbucks and spray customers with Febreeze in their faces if he thought they were 'dirty'.
