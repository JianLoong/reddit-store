Around a little after 7, Kevin comes into my room and asks me if I could drive him to his work that is about 20-25 minutes away because he left his laptop there and he had a quiz that he needed to take that was due that night.  I apologized and told him that I couldn't do it because I had a deadline.  He proceeded to ask me if he could just use my car and I said no.  When he asked why, I told him because the car belongs to my parents and they don't want anyone else driving it but me.  \n\nKevin got very angry and told me that I was being unreasonable because it would only take about 45 minutes and we'd be back home before 8 and that if he took my car, he was just going to go straight there and back.  I said that I was sorry, but I couldn't help him and he sulks out of my room and slammed the door.  I actually started to feel really bad and was going to offer to take a break after I got to a good point in my paper to take him, but then I heard him in the next room complaining to his girlfriend on the phone about me and calling me all kinds of nasty names so I just put my headphones in and concentrated on my paper.\n\nAbout an hour passed by and he comes back into my room and asked me if I could send him money for an Uber to go pick up his laptop.  I said \"No, why would you take money from a \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?\" and basically repeated all the names he called me.  He then tried to apologize and say that he was just stressed out and he didn't mean it.  I said no again and he lost it.  I packed up my laptop and some clothes and went to my boyfriend's house to stay the night and finish my paper which I finally managed to submit at like 11:45 thankfully.\n\nWhen I came back the next day, my roommate who is Kevin's girlfriend yelled at me for making Kevin miss an assignment when he gave me three options to help him.  We ended up fighting and things have been tense in the house ever since.  One of our other roommates thinks that I didn't do anything wrong, but the other roommate things I should have just helped Kevin to keep the peace in the house.\n\nI kind of feel like a AH for making things in the house tense and making Kevin's grade in that class lower.

The plain fact is that you weren't able to help him because you had a responsibility to the university to finish your paper, and you have a responsibility to your parents to not let anyone else drive their car. \n\nAlso? You have no obligation to Kevin. He's not your roommate, not your friend, and not your child. It's not your job to fix Kevin's fuckups.

GF needs to honor the lease agreement limit on number of nights in a row a guest can stay. And they need to keep their entitled arses out of everyone else's personal space. If they can't do that, you other roommates WILL inform the landlord of their long-standing violation of the lease terms. GF can officially get kicked out of the apartment with the bf that she is housing for free.

ETA: You and at least one of your other roommates need to be prepared to follow through.

ETA again: As I closed out, I saw the title again. Look at how much you've bought into Kevin blaming you. (1) You refer to Kevin as your roommate. He and his gf have got you considering him your roommate! (2) You describe yourself as \"MAKING HIM MISS\". You didn't leave his laptop at work. You didn't owe him a ride (either with you as his taxi, his free rent-a-car, or the Uber financier). Apparently, the dude doesn't have a single ACTUAL FRIEND he could have called during a multi-hour window who would have been happy to help THEIR PERSONAL FRIEND out. The title should be \"AITA for taking care of my own responsibilities for school and to my parents and my own pocketbook instead of letting this random squatter who is illegally in my residence bully me into giving up on my own boundaries and responsibilities to cave into his demands, curses and bullying?\" Gee, I don't know; that's such a tough call.", "NTA and check your lease.

I\u2019m not about to pay extra for a guest. \n\nAnother time I live with one roommate. Her boyfriend started staying all the time. I said look either you stop staying or you can move in and we split three ways. He ended up moving in and splitting. \n\nYour roommates boyfriend shouldn\u2019t be getting a free ride. If anything, your roommates should be jumping on board with you splitting everything 5 ways. It\u2019ll come out cheaper for everyone.
