I would speak to a college rep. There should be zero tolerance in behaviours that Kevin showed. He verbally attacked you. This is wrong on his part. Do not accept this treatment.\n\nLack of planning on Kevin\u2019s part does not constitute an emergency on yours.\n\nKevin forgot his laptop. That is on Kevin. Kevin missed his assignment all on his own.", "NTA - you owe Kevin's unprepared ass absolutely nothing", "NTA, you are not responsible for this man/child not having his crap together,  that is all on him. And why are you and the other roommates tolerating the one roommate having her bf live with all of you? Is he on the lease? Does he contribute equally to the rent, utilities and other expenses? If the answer is no then he needs to get the hell out and leave all of you alone so you can focus on your studies instead having to putting up with his whining and disrespect.", "Not your fault he's a scrub with no friends.", "NTA.\n\n'Kevin' was using strategic incompetence to try to make \\*you\\* fix HIS problem brought on by HIS careless thoughtlessness and lack of planning.", "NTA, you had a bunch of very valid reasons, that aside, why on earth would it be your responsibility to pay for his uber.  He's the one that forgot his laptop and clearly he works.  He can pay for his own uber or borrow money from his girlfriend, and unless he has no friends, he could have asked one of his friends to drive him (guessing either they all said no too or he chose to not even attempt it, sulk, and miss the assignment because he was mad at you and couldn't get his way).  Kevin has only Kevin to blame for his lower grade.", "NTA\n\nHe \"gave you three options to help him\"? What did I just read?\n\nAsk her why she couldn't send him money for his uber instead, or why she couldn't drive him? Or give him her car? Oh, are those not acceptable options for a girlfriend to do, but are acceptable for a _______?\n And why didn't the other house mate help him out either? It wasn't acceptable to her? Butnits acceptable for you to donit to keep the peace?\n\nSome people just need to be conked in the head to get that reality check to sink in, honestly. And this dude needs to stop blaming others for his stupid mistakes.", "Why, in too many of the stories on Reddit, do other people tell someone else that THEY should have bent to an unreasonable person\u2019s request that THEY should have done whatever just to keep the peace when the other person making unreasonable demands is the golden child?", "Thank you, my boyfriend's dad is putting a lock on my bedroom door tomorrow and my landlord is now aware of the Kevin situation and said he'd handle it.", "I'd ask the roommates to cough up money. When they inevitably flounder and make excuses, say, why can't you give him the money? Flip it on them\n\n\nBtw-. How do they know you have expendable money? I would be very careful with my financial details and mail around this group.", "Oh honey definitely NTA. Kevin on the other hand\u2026 you have a car and money so solve my problem for me cause I don\u2019t want to get a lecture from my parents? You had your own homework due and even if you\u2019d just been watching tv this was not your problem. Isn\u2019t there a bus? Especially after all the things he said about you there should be no expectation that you\u2019d help. And why on earth should you pay for his Uber? This kid really needs to grow up and learn how to be organized and solve his own problems. Your roommates are crazy if they think you should have sacrificed your grade to save his. And the reason you have a car is because your parents trust you not to let random people take it so you did the right thing there.", "SO WHAT?????  Your money is not, by default, someone else\u2019s when they demand it", "So a social club was more important than his grades to her?", "Omg yes.. \n\n > I'm not here to fund your stupidity\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude06 Perfect!", "Are you in the south? No offense but they expect women just to constantly cater to men down there. You told him no and have no obligation to pay for his Uber. \nOr your other roommate doesn\u2019t like you. Just find new roommates next year.", "What you can or cannot afford if absolutely no one\u2019s business but YOURS.", "You're right, that's exactly what my boyfriend said about the finances stuff.  They don't know how much money I have and I don't really talk to them about personal stuff, but they assume because I have a job and the car belongs to my parents that I have more disposable income than they do.", "One of my favorite quotes is \u201cif you believe you\u2019re entitled to a favor, then you\u2019re not asking a favor. You\u2019re making a demand.\u201d I think a lot of people subconsciously get that vibe and will say yes to a favor, no to a demand.", "And also, who is stupid enough to forget their laptop st work? That would be the first thing I grab when I'm getting ready to leave", "Sounds like at this point Kevin will just assert squatter right. Just be prepared. When is your lease up? Guy seems like a complete bum and his gf is a doormat. You aren\u2019t the AH but he is. So be prepared for this to get ugly fast. Your landlord may be helpful, but if he is like most college landlords again don\u2019t expect much. Shitty situations happen, and just be grateful you have the means to move when the lease is up.", "Honestly I would talk to your parents now. It would be good to get their perspective since they know you and the situation better. They probably have also had difficult roommate situations and can give you advise. This is the time in your life where your relationship changes with them from them technically being in control to becoming trusted advisors (if you have a good relationship) please use that to your advantage.", "100% great karma.", "Deadline pressure, I suppose. \n\nI have a feeling that 1985 wouldn\u2019t want Kevin, either, though good luck to him explaining what Wifi is.", "I wrote about this in a comment, but my boyfriend's dad is coming tomorrow to put a lock on my bedroom door.  I texted my landlord to ask if it was okay and he said yes, but asked me to call him to tell him what was going on.  I called him and he was furious about Kevin living there and said he would be coming by the house.", "Very smart idea. You luckily have a good landlord.", "NTA\n\nYou are not his mommy.  He can find his own ride to get his laptop.  Why couldn't he pay for the Uber himself? Why couldn't he take the bus - it was early evening and busses are still running.  Why couldn't his girlfriend Venmo him money?  Since he left his laptop at work, he could have called them to see if anyone would drop it off on their way home.  Lots of options he didn't want to take.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.  Your roommate and her boyfriend are very entitled.", "NTA. Maybe asking for car is still understandable but asking for money for UBER. man is broke. red flag. divorce him", "NTA first of all why didn't the other roommates or better HIS GIRLFRIEND send him money or take him.\n\nSecond Kevin is a grown man! HE forgot his laptop when he knew he had a quiz. You are not his care taker it's not your responsibility to make sure he has everything. \n\nThird he doesn't live there he needs to leave if hes not paying any bills!!", "NTA. Literally none of this was your problem or responsibility. Kevin is an adult, and ought to be able to take care of himself. Plus, once you've said \"no\" ONCE, that should have been the end of it.\n\nAnd his girlfriend's an ass, too. You didn't MAKE him miss his assignment, he did that to himself, and him giving you \"three options\" is completely irrelevant when your answer was no. She's the one who made things weird and awkward, not you.", "The fact that he asked OP for money for the uber? Wtf is that", "He also has a job and apparently isn't responsible enough to remember his own stuff, but somehow, OP should be ready to drop everything to help him??? Like, how does this make sense on any level???? \n\nNTA, OP. And change the title, because you didn't \"make\" him miss an assignment, he did that to himself", "And any of those flying monkeys who think OP should have helped to keep the peace could have paid for Kevin\u2019s Uber!", "So it sounds like it\u2019s **his problem** because 1) he left his laptop there in the first place, 2) he can\u2019t afford an Uber, 3) his gf doesn\u2019t have a job to afford an Uber either, 4) he\u2019s too afraid to ask his parents, and 5) he insults the one person he did ask for help \n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA", "But he works. So why didn't he order the uber?", "Why do they feel so entitled to your money?? You lending them money for something should be seen as a kindness, not an obligation. They were asking you for a favor and were then rude to you; you don't have to do favors for people who are rude to you.", "you're NTA, and your roommates are acting super entitled to your resources. that's not how the real world works.", "Tell her she needs to find a job if her bf needs to be sponsored. You have your own bf to sponsor. \n\ud83d\ude02", "I'd be going to the leasing office and explaining this situation. That you were chased out of your home while trying to focus on a very busy assignment that was due, due to harassment not only from Kevin & GF - but the rest of the roommates too. \n\nWhen they call a mediation meeting -Go ahead and let Kevin explain the situation and dig himself in a hole.\n\nedit: HES NOT EVEN ON THE LEASE.. kick his ass out yesterday. But you may need to be careful if hes lived there for an extended period he may have tenant laws covering him.", "Definitely time to call the landlord and get this loser out.", "Well now he knows you dislike him as well. I think you handled the situation beautifully by refusing, not giving in, and making it clear you heard all his insults. If you feel uncomfortable about it (which you shouldn't btw, but you might still) just ask for the one which you think has a stringer personality in how yo best assert yourself because I have a feeling this isn't over...", "OP, as a massive procrastinator, let me tell you that how you manage your time is nobody's business. I always start things last minute, whether it's for work or uni. This is my third degree and it's still happening. I spent my early 20s explaining myself to astonished \"well-meaning\" judgy people and it was exhausting. Now I just tell them it is what it is and that's it. You owe no one an explanation on why you start things late and when you find the time to finish them.", "Or another roommate who wasn't actively using theirs might've been willing to loan it to him for 30 minutes.", "Yes, I am in the south and no offense taken!  I will definitely be finding new roommates next year and setting up rules and boundaries from the very beginning of the semester.", "Yeah exactly! Who are they to dictate OP's finances? Even if the car is paid and such? She could have other expenses. \n\nThey sound like kids trying to justify mommy and daddy paying for their field trip, but you have this much mom! It's only $20! Only, OP is a stranger and has no obligation to them. Lmaoo", "But you don't get it! He gave her 2 good options which she refused, so of course she owed him that money! /s", "That's ridiculous that he has his own place and is living at yours anyways.", "You didn't stir up crap. It was stirred up around you.", "Sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders. Shitty roommate situations happen. Netflix even produced a documentary on it.", "It is NOT an a-hole move. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s what you do when a roommate tries to move in an extra tenant who doesn\u2019t pay rent. You are young. Conflict doesn\u2019t feel good, and that makes you feel like an AH for starting it. But some people just aren\u2019t considerate. They don\u2019t play by the rules. They don\u2019t keep to their share. And because of that, you have to oppose them. It never stops sucking, but you do start to realize that it\u2019s not your fault: it\u2019s theirs.", "i don't think the weight matters. what matters is that kevin is responsible for his things. before i leave my apartment for work i do a mental checklist- phone, keys, mask, headphones, laptop. and i do the same when i leave my office so i know i have everything i came with.\n\ndoes it guarantee that i don't forget anything? no but if i do, the only person responsible for my forgetting something is me.", "Well, it's because OP has the car sitting there unused and the audacity to turn down their request. \n\nThe very least they could do is pay for the uber since they sabotaged Kevin in every which way. Also, while we're at it, if Kevin fails his class due to this missed assignment, OP should pay for Kevin's tuition as well as recompense for this horrible act. Additionally they should cover his shifts at work and pay the rent for emotional damage. Also since he used minutes on the phone trying to solve this issue, due to OP, they should also cover his phone bill. It's going to take a lot to make up for this shortcoming!", "I really didn't want to tell them because I know they'd be upset with me for not speaking up earlier about Kevin being there, but I realize now that I need to say something.  I don't want to bother them at work so I will call tonight.  The landlord is in the loop now too and my boyfriend's dad is coming tomorrow to put a lock on my door.  So I feel a little bit better knowing that some older adults in the situation will be there to support me.", "He gave her 3 options for helping him as if it was her obligation. Why didn't the girlfriend send him money for an Uber? NTA", ">And you should report him living there without a lease go your landlord\n \nYes!! If the landlord finds out they have an extra person living there who isn't on the lease they could ALL get kicked out.", "Well, he should have been smart and not left his laptop at work. He literally could have gone to the library to take an online test, I'm guessing it's closes than his work place?", "If they are all in collage there is a good chance there was a libary or computer lab nearby he could have used.", "Kevin male, OP female---isn't it clear to everyone why she owes him?", "Well, they have discovered what happens when they assume! What jackasses!", "My favorite is \"he  gave you three different ways to help him  and you reused to do any of them.\"  Where was the GF, why wasnt she helping her BF is it was so important that it be done?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nPerfection!", "She needs to be careful with that, as depending on the landlord it could lead to them all being kicked out of the apartment. They all know he's there and there's likely a clause in the lease about allowing someone to live there and not be on the lease.", "I would tell the GF and Kevin that Kevin had six options once I said no.  Besides which, asking me to miss my deadline, use my parents car or give you my hardearned money are not viable options.  Plus  you called me horrible names.  You chose number 6\n\n1. Get GF stop what she is doing and take Kevin\n2. Kevin take the bus and get your laptop\n3. Kevin go to library and complete assignment\n4. Kevin use your savings to get an UBER\n5. Kevin phone a FRIEND, operative word being friend\n6. Do nothing and miss the deadline", "OP, you need to look deeper. His GF wasn't just \"doing some sorority stuff\", she was actively avoiding an unpleasant situation she created. We all have a bunch of things going on in our lives at one time, and GF doesn't automatically lose her responsibility to her roommates because it's inconvenient for her. \n\nLike it's also not your responsibility to pick up her dirt or pay for her BF's stupidity, just because you share an apartment with her. She brought BF into your lives---without asking---and it's up to her to keep him under control or get him out of there.", "Oh, so sorority stuff had precedence of schoolwork? Oh yeah, that\u2019s logical! \ud83d\ude44", "Exactly. Just because he gave options doesn\u2019t mean she was required to do one of them. He forgot about option D: None of the above.", "Why didn't his girlfriend pay for his Uber?", ">the other roommate things I should have just helped Kevin to keep the peace in the house.\n\nThis is the attitude that lets aholes continue to be aholes.  There is no universe in which OP owed Kevin anything, much less OP's time, money or car.  NTA"]}
