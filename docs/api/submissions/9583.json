Around a little after 7, Kevin comes into my room and asks me if I could drive him to his work that is about 20-25 minutes away because he left his laptop there and he had a quiz that he needed to take that was due that night.  I apologized and told him that I couldn't do it because I had a deadline.  He proceeded to ask me if he could just use my car and I said no.  When he asked why, I told him because the car belongs to my parents and they don't want anyone else driving it but me.  \n\nKevin got very angry and told me that I was being unreasonable because it would only take about 45 minutes and we'd be back home before 8 and that if he took my car, he was just going to go straight there and back.  I said that I was sorry, but I couldn't help him and he sulks out of my room and slammed the door.  I actually started to feel really bad and was going to offer to take a break after I got to a good point in my paper to take him, but then I heard him in the next room complaining to his girlfriend on the phone about me and calling me all kinds of nasty names so I just put my headphones in and concentrated on my paper.\n\nAbout an hour passed by and he comes back into my room and asked me if I could send him money for an Uber to go pick up his laptop.  I said \"No, why would you take money from a \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?\" and basically repeated all the names he called me.  He then tried to apologize and say that he was just stressed out and he didn't mean it.  I said no again and he lost it.  I packed up my laptop and some clothes and went to my boyfriend's house to stay the night and finish my paper which I finally managed to submit at like 11:45 thankfully.\n\nWhen I came back the next day, my roommate who is Kevin's girlfriend yelled at me for making Kevin miss an assignment when he gave me three options to help him.  We ended up fighting and things have been tense in the house ever since.  One of our other roommates thinks that I didn't do anything wrong, but the other roommate things I should have just helped Kevin to keep the peace in the house.\n\nI kind of feel like a AH for making things in the house tense and making Kevin's grade in that class lower.

You are neither his girlfriend nor his friend to be expected to drive him around or give him money to get his computer. \n\nIf this was a one of, given that tensions are high due to tests/grades I may be inclined to give Kevin a pass. However; if he is acting entitled and/or expecting that everyone else should bend over backwards while he is acting like a jerk then I would ask that he limit how often he comes to stay and/or ask that he not be there when your roommate is there as this is not his place but yours.", "Right?

Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself and have boundaries. Don't be afraid to discuss things and be clear about your needs.\n\nI had a roommate that I wasn't getting along with and who wasn't respecting my boundaries and the space (I was the leaseholder). I procrastinated asking him to leave because I was conflict averse and felt guilty. In the end he accidentally set the house on fire and I lost my home. I learned my lesson.
