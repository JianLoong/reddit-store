Her birthday, her candles, she should be the one blowing them out not someone else. That\u2019s just not cool.", "This is not about the Iranian yogurt..\n\nI would normally say N T A based on the incident in isolation, but within the bigger picture you were YTA for calling your daughter who\u2019s clearly struggling, a brat.", "YTA. There are brats in the story, and your daughter isn't one of them. Your niece needs parenting. Your daughter needs to provide it. And you should be kind do your daughter, not so mean.", "Why she need to be okay when people let a kid steal a moment from her? How do you know this moment isn't important for her? No, this don't make any sense. YTA. Ok, is a 5 years old kiddo, so it's the mother responsibilitynto not let the kid steal moments from other people.", "Yta. She obviously is going through something. She didn't berate anyone or anything, she just cried and walked away. That is not a reason to call her names and shame her.", "YTA.\n\nYou're insulting your daughter, who you say has been having a difficult time, for having human emotions. That's probably the worst thing you could have done in this situation.", "Info: do you think Zara's actual issue is about blowing out candles? Have you considered that maybe it's a perceived lack of control over her life or lack of something special just for her (like a bday party should be), or anything else really, because it's probably not actually the candles?", "I mean, in general I find ppl blowing their spit on cakes icky anyway. I find kids doing it even more gross...\n\nSo yeah, YTA.", "YTA but I don't think this really is about the candles. I don't think Zara was upset at her niece for blowing out the candles. (If she is, then she TA.) Maybe she was a bit disappointed that she didn't get to blow them out. That's two different things. It's OK if you've been excited about something and looking forward to something to be disappointed when it doesn't play out like you thought/hoped it would. Even if you're 23. Like you said, she's going through a hard time and is probably a bit sensitive. Calling her a selfish brat for having feelings is absolutely not OK. You don't know how she was feeling and what she was thinking. Why not try to talk to her and ask her about how she experienced the situation? Try to comfort her and validate her feelings? You're her mom, that's your job. She's a grown woman, she probably didn't \"get mad about birthday candles\" and it's unfair of you to assume so.", "YTA. You got so close to doing something genuinely kind for your struggling child and then ruined it. You owe Zoe an apology.", "YTA. Kids are fully capable of understanding manners and being polite when they are celebrating someone else. Being 5 doesn't excuse you from being a bratty asshole and it will actually only get worse. Sounds like your sister is a shitty parent and so are you for invalidating your daughter's feelings especially after KNOWING she is going through a tough time.  Apologize to your daughter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: your daughter is also the oldest and has likely spent majority of her life caring for her younger siblings/cousins and sharing her special times with them.

Maybe her crying was an overreaction, kinda hard to say to knowing the back story, but she clearly couldn\u2019t help the way she felt and walked away. It\u2019s about more than just the candles though!! No need for you to yell at her and call her names though. I think you need to talk to her more about what\u2019s going on with her and how better to help her, especially with her emotions.", "YTA. You already said she was going through a tough time.

A month ago one I was at a birthday party. Same situation but the kids were 9 and 3. 9 year old almost started crying but took it like a champ. Later on the parents apologized to the kid and everything was fine.", "YTA\n\nDid you ask her why she cried?\n\nUnless she's someone who normally demands it's all about her then crying over candles should be concerning rather then a reason to call her a brat. \n\nHave you never gone through a shitty time in your life, and something tiny that normally wouldn't phase you sets you off? It sounds like that happened and rather then showing compassion you called her names.", "The rule at all parties, unless the birthday person doesn't care, should be the birthday person blows out the candles first. You can relight the candles many times if others want a chance to blow them out. But the birthday person should have the option to blow them out first.", "YTA and so is your sister. Your niece should have been stopped and it should have been explained that the birthday party was not for her and the candles were not hers to blow out. As a parent I\u2019m always mind blown by the mentality that small children can do whatever they want because they don\u2019t know any better!

Did the five year old apologize? She\u2019s not a baby and maybe if she had used her manners your daughter wouldn\u2019t be upset.\nEdit.

And I think op shouldn't have just called her a brat because it doesn't help at all", "You are right...I already thought OP was YTA but the extra meaning of blowing out the candles hadn't occurred to me. You tend to make a wish when you blow out your candles and who knows what she was wishing for.", "Maybe \"brat\" is a strong word, but it is pretty ridiculous for an adult to get offended about a 5 year old blowing out their birthday candles.  You just light up back up and have a do-over.", "Great point. It isn\u2019t about the candles.", "Yeah, the daughter finally understood her place in the family. A laughing material when anything happen to her. Not the best thing to show to someone having a difficult time.", "I think everyone dismissing her on her own birthday is significant. Laughing at someone, especially when they are supposedly part of the family is even worse.", "It doesn't sound like a meltdown? She was sad and cried.", "Or maybe the niece shouldn't be blowing out candles or opening presents or doing anything that is for the person having a birthday. She's 5. That's old enough to understand someone else's birthday.

You can teach your kid all you want, but at a certain level, little kids are gonna be little kids. This is the kind of shit that 3,4, 5 year olds do without warning and like any normal adult reaction to that would be to point out that it wasn't their cake but also to understand that they are little kids and there is no malice involved in it. Getting upset and offended by something like this is absurd.\n\nIf my kid did this I would absolutely tell them to stop and not do it again, blah blah blah. But if it happened and an adult got huffy and stormed off to pout about it I'd be like, \"wow...that's ridiculous.\"  I wouldn't be offended like \"how dare you be offended that my kid did a bad thing\".  My reaction would be more like \"man I'm embarrassed that my kid did this stupid thing but the 23 year old' birthday girls reaction is absurd.\"  Frankly this is the kind of thing that most people would laugh about.", "it isn't until around age 5 that children start to learn that they aren't actually the center of the universe. it's perfectly normal behavior for a child that young to be pretty self interested. it's wild to me that some people expect children to act like adults.", ">Frankly this is the kind of thing that most people would laugh about.\n\nTrue, but it sounds like Zara was already struggling (enough that OP thought they'd throw a party to cheer them up).   Do *you* feel like laughing things off when it's just one bad event followed by another?", "It wasn't any party. OP didn't told clearly but it was a party on her daughter's birthday, one of the 3 she had since she turned 10 (OP doesn't throw parties after kids reach 10 years old, except 18th and 21st)", "No...I understand that Zara was having a hard time.  But Zara also is an adult and unless there is more to the story that OP isn't telling us, something like this (a 5 year old blowing out your candles) is a very very minor thing.  We have to be able to tell our children (including our adult children) if their behavior is over the top.  So yes, \"5 year old...that is bad, don't do that..it isn't nice\" but at the same time \"hey 23 year old. Come on, your getting pouty because of something a 5 year old kid did...grow up\" should also be something we can say.  Or to make it more positive, you don't have to say \"grow up\" but if I were in this situation I would probably more or less react the same way as OP.  I wouldn't say \"you're being a brat\" but I definitely would say, \"Yo...I know you're having a hard time but this is something a little kid did. You need to just get past it.  We'll relight the candles and you can blow them out again.\"", ">should also be something we can say.\n\nAnd it would be.....once the situation had calmed down.  Confronting an already upset person and insulting them, calling them a \"selfish brat\" while they're already clearly melting down, is just a recipe for disaster.   Not only are they NOT going to get the message, they're going to get even MORE upset and react even MORE irrationally.", "calmed down?  Jesus man..if we were talking about 2  5 year olds I'd be in total agreement with you.  But we're talking about an adult.", "I'm glad that your life has been such that you've never reached an emotional breaking point like Zara apparently has - one where you just simply cannot handle anything else going wrong - and I'm glad that those around you have never called you a \"selfish brat\" for daring to quietly remove yourself from a situation that you found upsetting.", "INFO: So she didn't yell at anyone? She didn't complain? She didn't say anything negative to the child? The sum total of her actions were making an upset facial expression, tearing up, and then removing herself from the situation?\n\nI ask because unless she did anything more than what you're describing, Y T A. Emotions aren't logical; you can't dictate that someone shouldn't feel negative emotions. What you can expect is that they manage those emotions rather than take them out on someone else. That's exactly what she did by removing herself from the situation. She felt herself get emotional over something \"silly\", realized she couldn't stop it, so she removed herself from the situation.\n\nAlso, the whole reason you threw this party in the first place was because Zara is going through \"a difficult time\". Now i dont know exactly what that means, but I didn't ask because in the end it doesnt matter what the details are, only that Zara is taking whatever it is hard. High stress (and grief, if that applies) make it hard to emotionally regulate. Minor things feel major, because your sensitivity is on high alert. You react to small things like they're big, even if you know intellectually that they're not. If your other kids are telling you you're not being fair, i think that's a pretty strong indication that whatever Zara's going through should factor into your expectations for her behavior.", "YTA. You comforted your sister, who's child was being rudely entitled, and insulted your daughter, the one the party was for and who by your own admission has been struggling lately. She didn't even make a scene. She just walked away\n\nEDIT: clarified a phrase", "YTA.  I always hate this at birthday parties.  Let the birthday person blow out their own candles.  Keep the spitting kids away.", "If a 23-year--old is crying because of candles, you should be concerned and not upset. It doesn't matter what the child's mother thinks, your daughter is obviously not doing ok. YTA.", "YTA.\nEven if she wasn\u2019t going through a hard time, your niece should have not been allowed to do that. Children can learn at a young age that not everything is about them. Considering your daughter is the oldest, I wonder if she\u2019s had this done to her her entire life.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s probably not about the candles that made her upset, it was probably \u201cyet another thing that\u2019s gone wrong\u201d and instead of her family saying \u2018hey, that\u2019s not cool\u2019 to your niece, everyone laughed and further made your oldest feel a little less on her birthday.", "YTA. You acknowledged that your daughter is having a tough time and then invalidate her feelings over something she was excited about. At the very least, the child should have been told that they are not to blow out candles meant for someone else, removed from the cake, and the candles relit. You did nothing but laugh at your daughter and tell her she shouldn't be upset. Her feelings are valid and it likely wasn't just about the candles. Your kids are right, apologize.", "YTA. You admit she\u2019s going through a hard time, so she\u2019s probably going to be more upset over things that normally would be a bother at most. You had a surprise party *for her* and then she can\u2019t even enjoy blowing out the candles on her cake because the niece did it. I guarantee the candles weren\u2019t the big thing she was upset about, but no one wants to even find out, you all just want to call her a selfish brat.\n\n\nBeing five doesn\u2019t excuse this sort of behavior either, how would niece feel if someone blew out HER birthday candles? Leaving the candles to the birthday person is just polite, and niece will have issues with other kids if she learns that her family thinks her blowing out candles that aren\u2019t hers is just \u201ccute\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s just being a kid\u201d and such. Nah, this is \u201cselfish brat\u201d behavior.

If the niece had a birthday party and one of her friends blew out her candles, she would be upset so why is it okay to do to Zara? Especially because you threw this party because Zara is going through a difficult time. (Have seen OP's comment that it's the death of a friend's older brother). And she did NOT cause a scene - she walked away. You can't help when you start crying but she removed herself from the situation immediately.\n\nDo you seriously think calling Zara a selfish brat is going to help her mental state right now in her difficult time? Of course not. You should have focused on your role as Zara's mother over your role as the 5 year old's aunt/your sister's sibling. Zara needed you more.", "Omg. It isnt about the candles.

Then she gets sad/mad someone else blew out the candles on her birthday cake so you berate her?   \n\nSO appropriate to tell a 23 year old woman she is behaving like a brat.   Would you have said that to a man?   Probably not.  Bro code and all that.   You owe her a huge apology.    Who behaved appropriately?   The mom of the kid who was embarrassed/upset.", "YTA- Look. Humans have emotions, yes even your adult children. \nYou said she was going through a hard time, and after investigating your comments you said that someone she knew passed away. I get that as an older adult you probably don\u2019t see why she\u2019s so upset, but she\u2019s in her 20s and the person who passed away was probably also young. That\u2019s a really really difficult thing to process and deal with. \nSo when you gave her this party to celebrate her and to cheer her up, you gave her a moment to forget. But forgetting for a little doesn\u2019t mean the emotions go away. Anything upsetting, no matter how \u201cinsignificant\u201d, can open up all the emotions she was most likely holding back while at the party. \nAlso who are you to judge what is significant or important in her life??? According to you she hasn\u2019t had a family party in 5 years. This was probably super important to her. \nSo YTA, learn to have empathy. Calling your daughter names when she is going through something you most likely don\u2019t understand is going to do long term damage. You\u2019re going to forget this ever happened in a couple of years, but she\u2019s going to remember. She\u2019s never going to come to you with any important emotions ever again.", "YTA.

If I step on your foot and break your toes and you get upset, I could roll my eyes and tell you to stop being such a baby, it's not a big deal. In that scenario, I'm not the one who gets to say if it's an issue or not. Someone else would obviously agree that objectively, I'd owe you an apology and compensation.

As an adult who often seems to overreact to weird, small things myself, it\u2019s usually because that thing is the final straw representing my larger stress. Case in point: I wanted to have a chill, relaxing weekend. Instead it turned into an exhausting weekend of errands and housework. The weather was nice, so I wanted to take a walk. I knew I still had stuff to do, but I finally convinced myself that a 45 minute walk with my dog would be fine. I had meat for dinner thawing on the counter. I covered it with a plate. I told my partner about it and told him to watch our sneaky cat. When I got back, the plate had been pushed to the floor and a bunch of the meat had been eaten. I snapped at my partner for not watching out for the cat, in a way that I quickly realized was uncalled for. I apologized and explained to him that it wasn\u2019t really about him, that I was upset that a weekend that was supposed to be relaxing has been exhausting and that I already felt guilty about going for a walk, and the meat incident felt like a reminder that I shouldn\u2019t try to do anything relaxing for myself. \n\nIf I had to put myself in Zara\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d guess that\u2019s what happened here. Her best friend\u2019s brother died. It\u2019s likely that she\u2019s been supporting her friend and putting herself and her own needs to the side to care for her friend. She\u2019s probably feeling like she\u2019s putting all of her energy into supporting someone else without getting that same support from others. To her surprise, she gets a birthday party! Some much-needed support and attention on her! But then her little cousin takes the attention away from her moment, and instead of the familiar reprimanding this kid for doing that and supporting Zara\u2019s feelings, Zara is told that her feelings don\u2019t matter and that she should be fine sacrificing her moment because the child is young. It once again makes her feel like her role is just to support other people and not get support herself, and after being given a sense that people are maybe giving her a moment of support via this party, it feels especially like having the rug pulled out from under her.\n\nI highly doubt it\u2019s just about candles, but even if it is, it\u2019s still rude to not reprimand the child for doing that.", ">Blowing out candles is meaningful to her (e.g. making a birthday wish, or because it's a rare occasion in your family).\n\nAn extinguished candle is also a pretty well established metaphor for *death* in Western culture...", "On top of that, she walked away when she started crying. Crying is an emotion and not a choice, so she didn't purposely cried _to achieve something_; but because she had emotions and her actions were to walk away to a quieter place.\n\nCalling someone a brat for simply having emotions, and not misbehaviour, is exactly the thing that gets children/people in a place where they have trouble to regulate emotions and will have hard times psychologically till later in life.\n\nI think you never should call anyone a brat, but especially not someone who is crying, because crying isn't a choice, it's just something that happens.\n\nOP, I'd highly suggest you look into therapy for yourself to talk about what you think is normal behaviour towards your kids and to learn how that can affect children.
