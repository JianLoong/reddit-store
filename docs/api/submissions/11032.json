Her birthday, her candles, she should be the one blowing them out not someone else. That\u2019s just not cool.", "This is not about the Iranian yogurt..\n\nI would normally say N T A based on the incident in isolation, but within the bigger picture you were YTA for calling your daughter who\u2019s clearly struggling, a brat.", "YTA. There are brats in the story, and your daughter isn't one of them. Your niece needs parenting. Your daughter needs to provide it. And you should be kind do your daughter, not so mean.", "Why she need to be okay when people let a kid steal a moment from her? How do you know this moment isn't important for her? No, this don't make any sense. YTA. Ok, is a 5 years old kiddo, so it's the mother responsibilitynto not let the kid steal moments from other people.", "Yta. She obviously is going through something. She didn't berate anyone or anything, she just cried and walked away. That is not a reason to call her names and shame her.", "YTA.\n\nYou're insulting your daughter, who you say has been having a difficult time, for having human emotions. That's probably the worst thing you could have done in this situation.", "Info: do you think Zara's actual issue is about blowing out candles? Have you considered that maybe it's a perceived lack of control over her life or lack of something special just for her (like a bday party should be), or anything else really, because it's probably not actually the candles?", "I mean, in general I find ppl blowing their spit on cakes icky anyway. I find kids doing it even more gross...\n\nSo yeah, YTA.", "YTA but I don't think this really is about the candles. I don't think Zara was upset at her niece for blowing out the candles. (If she is, then she TA.) Maybe she was a bit disappointed that she didn't get to blow them out. That's two different things. It's OK if you've been excited about something and looking forward to something to be disappointed when it doesn't play out like you thought/hoped it would. Even if you're 23. Like you said, she's going through a hard time and is probably a bit sensitive. Calling her a selfish brat for having feelings is absolutely not OK. You don't know how she was feeling and what she was thinking. Why not try to talk to her and ask her about how she experienced the situation? Try to comfort her and validate her feelings? You're her mom, that's your job. She's a grown woman, she probably didn't \"get mad about birthday candles\" and it's unfair of you to assume so.", "YTA. You got so close to doing something genuinely kind for your struggling child and then ruined it. You owe Zoe an apology.", "YTA. Kids are fully capable of understanding manners and being polite when they are celebrating someone else. Being 5 doesn't excuse you from being a bratty asshole and it will actually only get worse. Sounds like your sister is a shitty parent and so are you for invalidating your daughter's feelings especially after KNOWING she is going through a tough time.

Maybe her crying was an overreaction, kinda hard to say to knowing the back story, but she clearly couldn\u2019t help the way she felt and walked away. It\u2019s about more than just the candles though!! No need for you to yell at her and call her names though. I think you need to talk to her more about what\u2019s going on with her and how better to help her, especially with her emotions.", "YTA. You already said she was going through a tough time.

A month ago one I was at a birthday party. Same situation but the kids were 9 and 3. 9 year old almost started crying but took it like a champ. Later on the parents apologized to the kid and everything was fine.", "YTA\n\nDid you ask her why she cried?\n\nUnless she's someone who normally demands it's all about her then crying over candles should be concerning rather then a reason to call her a brat. \n\nHave you never gone through a shitty time in your life, and something tiny that normally wouldn't phase you sets you off? It sounds like that happened and rather then showing compassion you called her names.", "The rule at all parties, unless the birthday person doesn't care, should be the birthday person blows out the candles first.

Your niece should have been stopped and it should have been explained that the birthday party was not for her and the candles were not hers to blow out. As a parent I\u2019m always mind blown by the mentality that small children can do whatever they want because they don\u2019t know any better!

Even as an adult you might lose your shit.\n\nYTA for not understanding that she might be struggling with something else.", "YTA, so you throw Zara a birthday party because she\u2019s been going through a rough time, and the five year old blows out the candles, I think a lot of people would be annoyed. \nSo when she gets annoyed because HER candles were blown out you told her to suck it up and that she was a brat?\nDid anyone tell the five year old no or that it was wrong to do that? Did the five year old apologize? She\u2019s not a baby and maybe if she had used her manners your daughter wouldn\u2019t be upset.\nEdit. I\u2019d also like to know why you told Zara it wasn\u2019t the five year olds fault when in fact, it was her fault", "I think it was actually the daughter's birthday party, not just a party.\n\nOP says they don't make parties for kids older than 10 (except 18th and 21st) but this time decided to throw the party on her birthday because she was having a rough time.", "Also \u201cwe normally don\u2019t have big parties\u201d if your daughter hasn\u2019t had many chances to blow out candles, or if its been a long time, that could have been The Moment she was waiting for all party. You can\u2019t decide whats important to her. Maybe it wasn\u2019t okay that your niece blew out the candles, but it would have been okay if the niece opened a present, ya know? YTA", "Yeah but op said that Zara has been going through a difficult time, so while she did overreact, it could be explained. And I think op shouldn't have just called her a brat because it doesn't help at all", "You are right...I already thought OP was YTA but the extra meaning of blowing out the candles hadn't occurred to me. You tend to make a wish when you blow out your candles and who knows what she was wishing for.", "Maybe \"brat\" is a strong word, but it is pretty ridiculous for an adult to get offended about a 5 year old blowing out their birthday candles.  You just light up back up and have a do-over.", "Great point. It isn\u2019t about the candles.", "Yeah, the daughter finally understood her place in the family. A laughing material when anything happen to her. Not the best thing to show to someone having a difficult time.", "I think everyone dismissing her on her own birthday is significant. Laughing at someone, especially when they are supposedly part of the family is even worse.", "It doesn't sound like a meltdown? She was sad and cried.", "Or maybe the niece shouldn't be blowing out candles or opening presents or doing anything that is for the person having a birthday. She's 5. That's old enough to understand someone else's birthday. Would it be okay if the niece did this at another child's party?", "I think it's actually her birthday and OP decided to throw the party (unusual for her kids older than 10) because her daughter had a rough time.", "Or better: parents teach their 5 year olds manners and that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around them.", "I mean, I assume in most cases like this, the parent would say like \"Hey Jimmy that's not nice..that was Stacey's birthday cake let her blow out her own candles\".  You can teach your kid all you want, but at a certain level, little kids are gonna be little kids. This is the kind of shit that 3,4, 5 year olds do without warning and like any normal adult reaction to that would be to point out that it wasn't their cake but also to understand that they are little kids and there is no malice involved in it. Getting upset and offended by something like this is absurd.\n\nIf my kid did this I would absolutely tell them to stop and not do it again, blah blah blah. But if it happened and an adult got huffy and stormed off to pout about it I'd be like, \"wow...that's ridiculous.\"  I wouldn't be offended like \"how dare you be offended that my kid did a bad thing\".  My reaction would be more like \"man I'm embarrassed that my kid did this stupid thing but the 23 year old' birthday girls reaction is absurd.\"  Frankly this is the kind of thing that most people would laugh about.", "it isn't until around age 5 that children start to learn that they aren't actually the center of the universe. it's perfectly normal behavior for a child that young to be pretty self interested. it's wild to me that some people expect children to act like adults.", ">Frankly this is the kind of thing that most people would laugh about.\n\nTrue, but it sounds like Zara was already struggling (enough that OP thought they'd throw a party to cheer them up).   Do *you* feel like laughing things off when it's just one bad event followed by another?", "It wasn't any party. OP didn't told clearly but it was a party on her daughter's birthday, one of the 3 she had since she turned 10 (OP doesn't throw parties after kids reach 10 years old, except 18th and 21st)", "No...I understand that Zara was having a hard time.  But Zara also is an adult and unless there is more to the story that OP isn't telling us, something like this (a 5 year old blowing out your candles) is a very very minor thing.  We have to be able to tell our children (including our adult children) if their behavior is over the top.  So yes, \"5 year old...that is bad, don't do that..it isn't nice\" but at the same time \"hey 23 year old. Come on, your getting pouty because of something a 5 year old kid did...grow up\" should also be something we can say.  Or to make it more positive, you don't have to say \"grow up\" but if I were in this situation I would probably more or less react the same way as OP.  I wouldn't say \"you're being a brat\" but I definitely would say, \"Yo...I know you're having a hard time but this is something a little kid did. You need to just get past it.  We'll relight the candles and you can blow them out again.\"", ">should also be something we can say.\n\nAnd it would be.....once the situation had calmed down.  Confronting an already upset person and insulting them, calling them a \"selfish brat\" while they're already clearly melting down, is just a recipe for disaster.   Not only are they NOT going to get the message, they're going to get even MORE upset and react even MORE irrationally.", "calmed down?  Jesus man..if we were talking about 2  5 year olds I'd be in total agreement with you.  But we're talking about an adult.", "I'm glad that your life has been such that you've never reached an emotional breaking point like Zara apparently has - one where you just simply cannot handle anything else going wrong - and I'm glad that those around you have never called you a \"selfish brat\" for daring to quietly remove yourself from a situation that you found upsetting."]}
