{"id": 18380, "submission_id": "13u2vbq", "title": "AITA for refusing to let my MIL stay with us because she\u2019s upper class?", "selftext": "My (29F) husband (30M) grew up with a family with similar amounts of money as mine, but I grew up solidly blue collar/middle class (my dad was a boat repairman with all my uncles) while my husband grew up more in a white collar world, playing polo, sailing, owning horses, etc. We had a vacation home in a small beach town where we spent our whole summers while my husbands family spent two weeks each summer in the Hamptons. Our families just spent their money differently. We are all still about at the same bracket but act differently. \n\nMy husband\u2019s family occasionally visits us since we own a home with a guest room. They are nice but very different. For example, their homes are immaculate - nothing ever out of place, they move very deliberately with everything they do. I\u2019m not dirty at all but will sometimes leave out books I\u2019m reading for a few days and have more clutter. They don\u2019t swear, ever. I will swear if the situation warrants it (but never like at someone, more when telling a story). They\u2019re just a bit more uptight, which makes it hard for me to be totally authentic with them.\n\nThey also judge me when I\u2019m not the same as them. For example, they show up unannounced to drop in. I\u2019m like, \u201csorry it\u2019s a little messy, we didn\u2019t know you were coming!\u201d They look around and say: \u201cyeah, I see that.\u201d Or when they met my parents and my dad dropped a few f-bombs (at my parents\u2019 house and he had a few beers in him) they were shocked and clearly uncomfortable. Some dirt gets on the floor from someone\u2019s boots and I don\u2019t pick it up right away? Someone is pointing it out to me instead of just waiting 5 minutes until I finish what I\u2019m doing. Even cooking is different - my family is from Spain so we make (in my opinion) amazing food and go all out, and don\u2019t worry about cleaning until after. They make very safe meals, like pasta (VERY carefully) and never let a single thing drip out of the sauce pan. Everything is moderated.\n\nMy MIL recently asked if she could stay with us for a month. I like my MIL and don\u2019t mind her staying with us occasionally, but I always need to do a deep clean, be super careful of any messes while she\u2019s here, speak in lower tones, and never swear. It\u2019s like I can only show so much of myself and always need to be careful. I can\u2019t do that for a month. I told my husband no and he got upset. He said I\u2019m more open with my family and I should open up to his family. I told him I can\u2019t because they say they want to be close, but then judge me every time I do something less classy than them or act different. He told me I need to just ignore them and be myself and allow them to come over. I refused, he\u2019s angry, and now we\u2019re at a stalemate. AITA?\n\nEDIT: our beach house was TINY, with one bedroom and a 3 season porch for the kids, and we shared it with all of our cousins and aunt and uncle. We also rented it out during the off season. We did not grow up learning how to ski, we went to public school and did not travel much. My husband traveled the world, went to aspen, and hung out with people much richer than him as a kid. His parents did everything they could to maintain that lifestyle including working multiple jobs, renting vacation homes in desirable locations for a week instead of buying, etc. We came from similar money brackets but his parents really wanted the upper class lifestyle while mine wanted to stay more blue collar in nature (my parents both come from serious poverty) but did well with his business that he started when I was a child. I was unaware that there could be these subtle class differences until I met his family. My husband\u2019s long term ex was super, super wealthy so that doesn\u2019t help. I never claimed NOT to be privileged - I\u2019m so grateful to have grown up in my situation and have amazing childhood memories. Whether you want to call this a lifestyle or class difference, there is a clear difference between his families\u2019 expectations and mine.", "created_utc": 1685287030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13u2vbq/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_mil_stay_with_us/", "score": 2871, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he insinuated they were nuisances to him personally and he can't be bothered to be around them? Wouldn't you be angry?\n\nAlso, as advice, you might want to start dealing with your insecurities. They seem to be coloring just about all interactions with your in-laws. Most of the things you mentioned have nothing to do with class. Being tidy and not swearing is not a crime.

I\u2019m like, \u201csorry it\u2019s a little messy, we didn\u2019t know you were coming!\u201d They look around and say: \u201cyeah, I see that.\u201d Or when they met my parents and my dad dropped a few f-bombs (at my parents\u2019 house and he had a few beers in him) they were shocked and clearly uncomfortable. Some dirt gets on the floor from someone\u2019s boots and I don\u2019t pick it up right away? Someone is pointing it out to me instead of just waiting 5 minutes until I finish what I\u2019m doing. Even cooking is different - my family is from Spain so we make (in my opinion) amazing food and go all out, and don\u2019t worry about cleaning until after. They make very safe meals, like pasta (VERY carefully) and never let a single thing drip out of the sauce pan. Everything is moderated.\n\nMy MIL recently asked if she could stay with us for a month. I like my MIL and don\u2019t mind her staying with us occasionally, but I always need to do a deep clean, be super careful of any messes while she\u2019s here, speak in lower tones, and never swear. It\u2019s like I can only show so much of myself and always need to be careful. I can\u2019t do that for a month. I told my husband no and he got upset. He said I\u2019m more open with my family and I should open up to his family. I told him I can\u2019t because they say they want to be close, but then judge me every time I do something less classy than them or act different.

We ate very well, though we cooked with care without being sloppy, and friends always asked when we were making various dishes that were exotic to them.  We weren't wealthy but we weren't poor. \n\nEven my male cousins instied to be careful and smart about doing things (most guys around the world don't give a shit about being tidy/careful or graceful). \"Don't make life more difficult\" and \"do things with grace\" were the key principles of how we did things.  For example, after washing hands , you made sure to very carefully move your hands up and down above the sink to remove excess water so the water doesn't spill everywhere else, especially not on the floor (because that can ruin the floor or leave stains).  What I see most people do is either shake hands violently so the water flings in various directions or let the water drip on the floor and then people step on that with socks on. When eating, make no spills on the table because now you have to clean up more. When cooking, don't spill on the stove top because it's more work for you later to clean all the crevices. Being careful and intentional isn't being uptight like OP thinks, it's just smart because it avoids more clean up/repair work down the road. \n\nI'm lucky my mother came from a household where such values were instilled and that she passed that on to me. I see our a lot more wealthier relatives on the father's side of the family be a lot less careful and generally dirty, even though their houses have tens of thousands of dollars of  tasteless but expensive decor. \n\nSome people just don't understand that they are making their lives (and often someone else's) \n more difficult by being sloppy and \"going all the way out\" in OP's words.", "I understand your side.

Unlike most Americans who chucked off the old world, they and their decendants remembered their ancestry, and many formed the nucleus of the American upper crust, especially in New England. Even those who were less wealthy remembered their ancestry. My ancestors came for political reasons that stemmed from religious differences (They had issues with the Stuart kings). They might have ended up in the tower if they hadn't run for it. Many aristocrats on the losing sides ran for it, if they could, during the results of the English Civil War through the Restoration. The thing is, many of these people or their decendants ended up in positions of leadership in the new colonies. Their decendants set up the DAR, which is why it was such a good example for you to cite.  It's still social and hierarchical here in America, but it's more subtle, even hidden, in a way.
