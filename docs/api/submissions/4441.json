You were in an impossible situation and did what you thought was best for everyone. Rumor mills are gonna mill rumors, especially about bosses.", "I wonder if you can figure out who started it and send them a cease and desist", "You should have told him.

He knows you didnt tell him for selfish reasons.   The good part about having a friend at the company you work is they will cover your back.", "YTA \n\nIf you have any respect at all for your boss you need to tell him. \n\nYou didn't state if he has a marriage / relationship that could get ruined by this rumour, which obviously would make it much worse, but you definitely chose to hurt his reputation and harm his career to benefit your own even if he is single. \n\nAnyone claiming otherwise has clearly never worked in a career job.", "YTA.  You needed to tell him.  The rumor involved him as much as you.  Him knowing won't change the rumor but it can help him get ahead of the issue as your boss and an figure in the company.  It could have a negative affect for you and/or him in terms of the company and HR.    There are a lot of issues surrounding bosses and their employees being in relationships and how it could look in terms of other employees and favoritism or sexual harassment.", "INFO: When you first heard the rumor, how did you respond to it?", "NTA, but I understand why he is upset.  You don't need to tell him, but he looks very bad if that rumor went around.  Mostly because it looks like someone is sleeping to get promotions.  \n\nHe would probably need to address it, so people don't see him as sexually abusing his power.", "NTA, and honestly this is just an unfortunate situation all around\u2014given that you\u2019re at the mercy of others\u2019 gossip. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault the rumors started, and you did the right thing by staying out of it.
