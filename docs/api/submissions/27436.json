But what if there's an emergency, you'd be naked!\" thing here on Reddit. An emergency is exactly when nobody cares you were nude.", "from what ive heard its being pushed in the US that nudity is inherently sexual and treated as such, while in germany for example its less the case where its normal to have nude areas on beaches or nude sauna ir seeing someone tanning naked in the park, since here its seem as something natural instead of something sexual. it might also have to do with the US being hyper conservative and focusing so much on some specific christian values", "Actually  they are older now and we get along great . We had a tiny apartment  and they locked their doors if they wanted privacy  and we always made compromises like that . But I damn well made sure our air conditioning  was cold af in the summer  , so OP problem  would never have been a problem  in my home . Teenage years are always difficult  though because they can have entitled attitudes  at that age .", "How is it relevant what size her boobs are?", "It's hot enough that you usually don't want it to be that hot at all times at home.

It\u2019s not even remotely a correlation =/= causation thing.\n\n>underpants are still expected\n\nWhat cultures are you talking about? There are several cultures where one can be absolutely nude, it\u2019s just a hangup of the society you grew up in. I\u2019d accept your assertions more if you had actual sources, but again, the climate is not a reason why", "I'm so confused as to the point you're trying to make.
