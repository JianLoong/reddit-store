I mean there was zero time between the knocking and the door opening, he was basically opening the door as he made the third knock.

If I need to leave my room when I'm naked, I put on clothes. People don't want to see me naked and I don't want people to see me naked.

So many cultures are fine with it because it\u2019s TOTALLY natural. It\u2019s so weird what we can get hung up on for the sake of modesty. \u201cModesty\u201d being another man-made concept. Gosh, my hippy\u2019s really showing.\n\nBut still, the majority of cultures don\u2019t find it degrading at all. You mentioned \u201cfeeling used.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty substantial hang-up to have, I\u2019m sorry nudity has such an effect on your psychology. That really, really, sucks, and I just wish we, as a society, had a better understanding of what being naked is.\n\nI\u2019m a gay man, btw, so if you\u2019re a woman I do not want you to assume I\u2019m just a perv. So many cultures engage in public nudity, I just envy them. I relish in the feeling of being open, in a totally non-sexual way. I understand if that\u2019s not universally understood."]}
