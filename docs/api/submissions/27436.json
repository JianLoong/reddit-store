She just wants to be naked and that\u2019s fine if she lived alone !", "okay but that's extremely stupid and there's a reason I have doom in my name", "you're actually harrasing me I'm telling my friends to report you", "Because a father walked in on his fully naked daughter and made her uncomfortable lmao. It\u2019s not Reddit. It\u2019s weird", "It's definitely bc of Christianity. In genesis Adam and eve were ashamed they were nude after eating the fruit and made themselves clothes.", "But many British women will happily go topless on beaches in the Med. And on the other hand if Americans are so shy why the hell do their toilet stalls have huge gaps in the door!", "People in Scandinavian countries appear to have no hangups about being naked in saunas etc.", "NTA,  However normal people don't sit around naked esp teen girls. Perhaps you weren't just \"sitting around\". \n\nWHERE are everyone's parent? WHERE IS YOUR MOM CORRECTING HIM????\n\nWhere does it stop? THEN they have to be MODEST CLOTHES no doubt.", "NTA. I knock and wait for acknowledgment from my 12 and 8 yr olds. Yeah it\u2019s my house, but it\u2019s common courtesy. If I\u2019m going to demand that respect from others, I can give them the same respect.", "NTA He should have waited for an answer, that's the whole point of knocking. That said, his house, his rules.", "Nope", "NTA, everyone should have a space to be naked.", "NTA wait to catch your dad in the nude and pull the same stunt a brown eye for a brown eye", "You are not", "NTA, its your room. But if your family gotta to make you feel this way about it. Ill be someone who would congratulate you on getting your first home \ud83d\ude01 i wish you all the best man", "NTA if you can't add a lock, get a door stop. I've raised a teen and I would never have gone barging into her room without waiting for a response. Privacy is absolutely vital in your teenage years.", "NTA, your room, your space, your body.", "Patents who don't knock , wait for a \"come in\" and barge in are honestly annoying as hell", "nta because its your space and you can do what you want. Although, I lived in a family where people would be nude all the time and no one cared.", "Watching YouTube naked. Sure you were.", "Dad thinks he\u2019s right because it\u2019s his house. Dad should also expect the same respect he\u2019s giving you. Can you barge into his room? Common courtesy is to knock and wait for a response then if it\u2019s good timing, enter. I do this with all of my kids grown or not. You are not the AH", "NTA, I hate when people fake knock. Also, your dad is acting like he's never naked in his own room, oh the hypocrisy.", "Lol NTA, I chill partially naked in the living room sometimes. It shouldn\u2019t be that big a deal you are family. But even if that\u2019s not y\u2019all\u2019s dynamic it\u2019s your room and they should wait for you to say come in if they are going to come into your room.", "I had a housemate learn the hard way that knock-immediately open is a good way to be confronted with me, with my privates out.   \nHe still did it once or twice.   \n\n\nMight help that I'm gay, and he was a prude, lmao.", "Door locks, it's why their on bathrooms.  If you can be caught being naked so easily than don't be naked,  there's rarely a reason that it's so hot you can wear underwear", "Dads gotta love em'", "NTA you have a right to your privacy. he completely invaded that when he decided to barge in on you without you even telling him that he could enter your room.", "i wasnt even allowed to/culturally not a nice thing to do was  close my room door unless i was changing lol so i dont know what to tell ya", "NTA, this is a bad habit of many parents who don\u2019t understand that their children are grown and now NEED privacy.", "So Dad opened the door too quickly - he was definitely wrong. But - and just being devil\u2019s advocate - door locks are a thing. If you\u2019re going to do naked on the computer, I\u2019d advise using it when privacy is paramount. And get one if you don\u2019t have one already. Your privacy and dad\u2019s eyes will thank you for it.\n\nAnd, kinda not buying the \u201cit was hot\u201d thing, but you\u2019re entitled to be naked on your computer if you want (assuming that you are an adult).", "And this is why I snapchat my kids if I need them.\n\nNTA", "NTA but I think you should be very aware that it's not 'your' room, you didn't buy the house, you don't pay the mortgage, it is his house.", "So what I do when someone barges in my room is I yell \u201cnaked\u201d and they usually stop right where they\u2019re at. It\u2019s my kids. My husband will continue to come into the room but the kids stop dead in their tracks. Maybe do that in the future. But you\u2019re NTA.", "Sit your dad down for a talk. Say, you need to respect my space in my room and pause after knocking to hear come in as it is common courtesy. Use his own tactics against him and if he has a problem with it, ask him how you're supposed to follow his edicts. Respect has to be mutual to work.", "u/Lun4B34r we need an answer", "Yeah I remembered this post too", "There are portable security bars that can be mounted underneath the doorknob and keep the door from opening just in case dad is a tyrant and won\u2019t allow locks on doors.", "I needed this laugh tbh", "Not to mention smells!", "If he didn't notice you fucking, you weren't doing it right!", "Yeah, my kids are human beings and deserve privacy and respect...

For some reason that seems really hard to come by these days.", "Houston here, fuck those people.", "Lmao well we stopped when he did the knocking, but he barged in right after without waiting for a response and we were both ass naked.", "My mom, too.  She'd barge right in.  I had to be brutal when I was paying rent on the room.  There was yelling ngl.\n\nNTA.  You dad needs a lesson in mutual respect.  If he wants respect he's also gotta give some.  And an apology isn't for losers, it's for people with some brains.", "Neither of those things is indicative of emotional growth.", "For real! One time there was an earthquake where I lived (tiny, didn\u2019t damage anything but was totally noticeable) but I heard my dad say \u201cIronblight, but on some pants!\u201d While the earth was shaking!

You're telling me she doesn't have a damn lock ?!!! She is pissed because the dad lays down the rules . Oh , how sad. Now she has a ton of teenagers  who hate their parents cheering her on . Your right , common  sense  won't prevail in arguments with teenagers.", "I was in a 7.0 quake. It was the middle of the night and everyone woke up and ran to stand in their bedroom doorway. It was utterly terrifying, we were all staring at each other and it wasn't til significantly after it stopped that I realised two of my flatmates were naked. In a real emergency nobody cares if you're wearing clothes, and in a medical emergency they're probably getting cut off you anyway!", "Yes I am a woman.  Not sure why I got so many downvotes for saying I personally don't like being nude lol, not sure how that affects others.  My problem with feeling used is more when anyone else sees me nude, although I just really don't like the feeling.  I feel exposed and unsafe.  Personally I don't like being looked at regardless of whether I'm clothed or not.  I'm also almost completely blind so other people look really weird to me, like literally everything's distorted so that might be why I don't like being around other nude people.", "Emotional growth. Yelling at their kid and not allowing them privacy is not a sign of an emotionally stable, grown adult.", "More of a cultural thing, in my opinion. I\u2019m sure there are Frenchman who are insecure and stuff but they don\u2019t consider nudity a big deal.\n\nIt\u2019s American culture that makes people feel ashamed, and insecure, and why we have this lame system today", "Not definitely. It comes up in several cultures and religions", "Can you please wear clothes does not equate to yelling.", "Look , I'm not a  psychiatrist    , but this girl has her own floor at her home . If she doesn't  want to be disturbed by her family for whatever reason she should lock her door . But she is not happy her father says put some damn clothes  on and respect  that it is his home . That's stupid because  she just doesn't  like the rules . So she goes on reddit to bitch about it . And gets all this sympathy  from other teenagers  that her father is a ahole.  When in fact no one is the a hole . She has to learn how to get along with her parents  , and in typical  teenage fashion the parents are the bad guys . Look , you won't ever get it until you have teenagers  ."]}
