His family arrived around six, and everyone was hungry and wanted to go out to eat.

My son stayed home with me, because he wasn't hungry and wanted to stay.\n\nI woke up early this morning, and I made tea and sat by the pool while my son played. When my sister in law woke up, she came out to the pool and told me off for eating early, not going to dinner and being so standoffish. She said everyone wanted to see me and my son, and I was being such a bitch. I said I was tired from traveling.\n\nShe said if I forced myself to stay awake, I'd be on the same schedule as everyone else, but since I went to bed early and woke up early I was going to have the same excuse tonight. She also told me off for not making breakfast when I was the first to wake up, but I didn't know when everyone was going to wake up, and no one wants cold breakfast.

When your body is sending hunger signals you should eat. Waiting 3 hours to do so is ridiculous and unhealthy. And your child\u2019s bedtime would have likely occurred during the time they were out for dinner, so pretty inconsiderate of them to not include that as a factor when choosing a dinner time.\n\nAnd like, these people are adults. They cannot get themselves breakfast? Lol.", "ESH.  I agree with other posters that you could have had a snack, then gone to dinner.  But even if you made a meal, you could have still gone with them.  A family dinner isn\u2019t about food, it\u2019s about time together with the family.  Travel and pool time can both make you tired, but you could have stuck it out to sit with the family for an hour or two.  \n\nHowever, your SIL was wrong to tell you off in such a rude way.  There are better approaches to telling you she\u2019s disappointed that you didn\u2019t join them.  Additionally, it is not your responsibility to make breakfast for everyone just because you\u2019re the first person up.  You don\u2019t know everyone\u2019s morning schedule.  And unless it was planned, breakfast shouldn\u2019t fall on your shoulders.", "NTA why is everyone on a damn schedule the first night. I get that you should spend time together but then to also expect you to make breakfast just because you woke up early? She\u2019s just looking for something to fight about. She\u2019s making assumptions. Vacations are for relaxing not to be on the go. Obviously make time\nFor dinner but it doesn\u2019t have to be every night.", "NTA.  Travelling affects people differently.  Forcing yourself to stay up may work for some, but it doesn't work for everyone.  You did what you needed to do for yourself and your son.  Do not apologize - you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Your SIL is awful!\n\nTravel is hard, especially with a kid.  Some adjust  much more quickly than others.  You should ALWAYS plan on an adjustment day/buffer time depending on how far traveled, if time zone issues.  If don\u2019t need it great, be pleasantly surprised, but plan it.\n\nWhen people are tired they can\u2019t perform social niceties (particularly introverts), that\u2019s not being cold, it\u2019s called I need sleep.\n\nEdit: some ppl can nap others can\u2019t.  It screws me up, way better to just sleep a tad early.  Like if it\u2019s a 6 hour shift, I\u2019ll shift 3-4 hours first night, 2-3 hours next than be percect.  Way better for me than trying to nap or do full 6 hour time shift at once.", "Absolutely NTA. Your SIL was rude beyond reason to you. Shit happens - you got there early and you and your kid were hungry. People should eat, when possible, when they feel hunger. It\u2019s healthiest for your body. Could you have gone to dinner and ordered a salad or a side of fries? Sure - but you were also exhausted from traveling. Everyone knows that the first day of vacation, not the first full one but the arrival day, is all over the place. The fact that she was pissed you didn\u2019t make breakfast cements the point that you needed your rest to deal with these people the rest of the trip. NTA.", "NTA - \n\nI really can\u2019t fathom having someone call me a \u201cbitch\u201d for eating. If anything I\u2019d be a bitch because I get HANGRY. Never mind your son, you didn\u2019t indicate how old he is (may not be relevant) but my girls (4 & 6) are truly awful humans when they are hungry. They must get it from me.", "What's the timeline? You arrived in the afternoon, ate, slept, made yourself breakfast when nobody else was up yet; so maybe 12 to 18 hrs. How long is this vacation? Did you blow the only night you had available? WTF!? It sounds like your in-laws are self-centered and only are satisfied if you play by their rules.\n\nI might understand that they express disappointment at not seeing you at dinner, but \"you should have made everyone breakfast because you woke up first\" is a bit of a leap. Not The Asshole. But if this attitude towards you keeps up, maybe you should be.", "NTA I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your sister in laws place to scold you like a child.\n\nYou have the right to eat and go to bed when you want. Plus if the in laws didn\u2019t arrive till 6 at the earliest you could have eaten would have been 7. Most places are extremely busy at that time. So let\u2019s say you are and came straight home which put you and your son going to bed 9 or 9:30. That\u2019s really hard on a already tired 7 year old after traveling all day. If they didn\u2019t want to take your feelings in to consideration they should have at least took his. \n\n\nAs far as making breakfast for everyone your not a cook or a maid. It\u2019s a family vacation yes, however that should not meant the family dictates every time you eat and sleep. That also means you should not be expected to cook for everyone. Should you help cook? Yes but you didn\u2019t come along to be their maid and cook.\n\nYour husband needs to tell his sister she was way out of line for the ways she spoke to you and for expecting you to be everyone\u2019s cook. This is your vacation also.", "I'm going with ESH, for OP because she was passive aggressive in her behaviour. Yes, I'll buy kid was hungry and tired, and she was. However a tide you over snack at 4pm won't ruin a 7pm dinner, and a quick nap would have freshened both up to go enjoy the evening meal with family. OP chose instead to eat a full meal with her kid, and noped out of a group dinner she was aware of in advance, not as an oops, but because IMO, OP never wanted to go on vacation in a group to begin with. OP didn't *want* to join for dinner, and blew everyone off and went to bed. That's just rude.\n\nSIL sucks for being rude and confrontational first thing in the morning, and, according to OP, OP wasn't aware first one up cooks breakfast is the habit for this family group. If OP didn't know, it's unfair to be belligerent about it. \n\nSIL tho has a point about OP being stubborn about their own sleep/wake schedule and refusing to adjust it to be with the larger group. IMO this is OPs immature way of avoiding attending group meals/events she simply doesn't want to attend. \n\nNext time, just don't go on the group holiday if you don't want to be with the group.", "NTA.  If that was only the first day of your vacation, I imagine you\u2019ll have plenty more opportunities to visit and eat with your husband\u2019s family.  Not joining them for one single meal should not be such a big deal.", "NTA - A family gathering needs to include grace that everyone may not be physically 'ready' to do all scheduled activities. \n\nHer response was hurtful and extreme. At no time did SIL ask if you're feeling better and the family is looking forward to spending time with you and your son.", "NTA You\u2019re an adult & can eat when you are HUNGRY & your child shouldn\u2019t have to suffer because of the \u201cgroup\u201d fuck them. And you should\u2019ve told her & anybody else off for that reason alone.", "NTA but I would have just made a snack to hold me since you knew they were coming. That said she still has no reason to talk to you that way. She is your mother and your not the maid. Small error and now you won\u2019t do it again. Stay up tonight, eat with them and make it a point to talk to everyone. Accept the sister in law of course, just be polite but if she comes for you. Just say that your sorry about eating early and going to bed and it won\u2019t happen again. As for breakfast just say what you said and you weren\u2019t sure what everyone would like. But if they liked they could let you know what and when and you would be happy to make breakfast. Take the high road and make up for missing them that evening.", "Umm\u2026 his family is very needy aren\u2019t they? NTA at all. Yeah it\u2019s a bummer you were tired and couldn\u2019t hang out with them. Oh freaking well.\n\nAlso, who came up with the \u201cfirst person awake cooks breakfast\u201d rule? I guarantee if you\u2019d cooked someone would have bitched about it and wanted to go out to eat instead, or saying you\u2019re too loud because you went to bed early, or whatever.

I also think you could of had something at 4 that was more of a snack to keep you going until 7. I\u2019m and early eater too and I would be beyond hangry if I had to wait 3 hours to eat.\n\nHowever I think YTA for how you handled the situation.

Your husband family seems to have travel rules that are not universal, and have never been communicated to you.", "NTA, but your sister in law is made of the same trash your husband and his family are.  You should take the kid and leave. How incredibly abusive to attack you and call you a standoffish bitch.  He probably learned to call you that by your husband, who was undoubtedly badmouthing you all night.", "And this is why you can't travel with everyone", "Yes, YTA - Your husband asked you to wait to eat and go out to dinner with his family. You could have made a light snack and taken a quick nap so that you would be able to participate in the family event. Instead, you had a full meal, sat by the pool (which tends to make you more tired, not less) and then went to bed early.", "NTA. After that conversation who cares that they wanted to see you, you no don't want to see them. They sound used to everyone scheduling themselves around their idea of being an entitled group. \n\nSIL sounds like she was up early enough to cook breakfast. My sympathies, it sounds like it will be a very long vacation. But don't apologize, it will only encourage them to act out more.", "Sorry but you sound pretty self centered and by having your son follow your lead he is going to end up being seen as just an extension of you. I\u2019m not saying that you guys shouldn\u2019t of had a little snack, but to eat a full meal, then just skip out on the family dinner and go to bed early does sound very antisocial.", "When you're vacationing with a group it is obviously polite to participate with the group.  I can see giving your kid a snack to hold him over until dinner, but you are an adult.  Yes, you were rude.  This isn't a solo vacation.\n\nYTA", "NTA vacation is for relaxing.  if your husband didn't care you missed dinner why should she. all thats needed is a lighthearted \"sorry I missed you last night, hope dinner was good...\",  \n\n\n if you skipped out on a helicopter ride and a deposit was made or something, then  I can see being annoyed, but a dinner is no big deal, every family vacation you should have alone time with your own family. enjoy yourself.", "ESH, you could have been more understanding.

It's even worse with the kids. \n\nI probably would have sucked it up and gone to the dinner, even if I was tired, but I can understand not wanting your son to get overtired because kids get difficult when they're overtired.

The first day/travel day of a vacation is a freebie. No expectations but to settle in, relax, and unwind. I\u2019d reconsider future family vacations if they are so inflexible and rude. Group vacations do not mean you have to do everything as a group. I assume there are several more days of togetherness planned. *yay*\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous the questions being asked- how old is your child? How long did you travel? Why didn\u2019t you have a snack or a nap? Doesn\u2019t matter. No one else gets to judge whether or not you are stressed enough, hungry enough, or tired enough to do what you feel you need to do. \n\nTraveling with a child of any age is stressful- you\u2019re prepping and planning for yourself and them. Maybe you\u2019re hungrier than a snack and maybe you\u2019re not a nap person. (Personally, I\u2019d love to nap but can\u2019t. Either my mind won\u2019t shut off to let me rest or I sleep so hard I\u2019m out for 3 hours and wake up disoriented not knowing what century it is. And, ironically, more tired than when I started.)\n\nAs an adult, you\u2019re not asking for permission or approval to eat and sleep when you need/want. Their preferences do not trump your own.

Yikes. NTA. Though your nasty SIL would probably have a problem with you not being cheery if you had gone out.\n\nPlus while it does make sense to try to align your day with the others, a travel day is a good exception to make. Her telling you off because of course you\u2019re going to do it again is ridiculously overbearing.

Fuck that, that\u2019s not a vacation that\u2019s WORK", "again it\u2019s not that OP or their kid waited, it\u2019s that they did not join the group when everyone else got there that bothers me. \n\nNobody will be upset if the 4 year old is there but doesn\u2019t eat.", "it\u2019s a family vacation, the entire point of those is to have quality time with a group of people. Part of the bargain in signing up for a group trip is that you won\u2019t always get your exact way and will need to compromise.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to consider certain other people when you are on a trip, don\u2019t go with those people.", "If you want to have everything on your terms, you don\u2019t go on a vacation with others and especially not with family.  On a family vacation, the point is family togetherness.\n\nI totally agree that OP & son should have had a snack, and maybe even a nap. I also think OP could have gone to dinner and ordered an appetizer (or nothing at all), and even left early, for the sake of seeing family. \n\nIt seems like the family were excited to see them, and OP sent a pretty clear signal that this excitement was not reciprocated. I\u2019d be disappointed in their behaviour, too. \n\nYTA in this situation, OP.", "Plus there\u2019s quality over quantity. Like if OP was just gonna be exhausted and dealing with a tired, fussy toddler (which I\u2019m sure is what would\u2019ve happened), it\u2019s not like they would\u2019ve enjoyed the time together. I think it would\u2019ve been worse for everyone if they had. A four year old is not someone who should be forced to stay awake when they\u2019re exhausted.", "Five hours total, curb to curb, is literally nothing.  It's just not a hard travel day.  Five hours?  This person was not exhausted, she just did not want to go to the family dinner.", "I fly all the time.  A two hour flight, including airport time, driving time, rental car time.  5 hours max.  Not a taxing travel day.", "Well..in europe it does!", "CST to EST, maybe", "I live in Texas, 4 hours and you're still in Texas...", "No, it's not!\n\n4 hours of anything doesn't mean your entire rythm gets screwed. If she travels for 4 hours and arrives by 4, then she left home by noon. How can she need to eat a full meal at 4 then go to bed? Even with hard physical or mental labor does she need this after only 4 hours.\n\nShe doesn't. She just wants to avoid the company.", "yeah, I\u2019ve seen the same bias occur when it comes to things like cooking.\n\nIf he messes up a meal and makes her eat it, \u201che shouldn\u2019t subject her to that just because he can\u2019t follow a recipe\u201d\n\nIf she messes up a meal and makes him eat it it\u2019s \u201cshe tried her best, she didn\u2019t have to make anything for you at all you know, you better have done those dishes mister\u201d", "Bingo! She refused to compromise and participate in a large family vacation. This would be slightly rude if it were well into the trip, but the first day when everyone is excited to get together?..kind of a shitty way to start a trip out. \n\nIf it was with her family and her husband did this, Reddit would be erecting makeshift gallows to hang him from.", "No, if OP were a man and the wife had said to wait (read the post, this is how OP phrased it. She wasn't *asked*) this thread would be calling her a nagging bitch and cheering him on.", "most successful relationships thrive on good communication and compromise.  not sticking to a plan or else.", "> It was around four o'clock, and he was saying we'd eat at seven.\n\ndidn't miss it at all.  if they all went somewhere to eat around seven, by the time everyone got seated and ordered, that can take a while, depending on the service at the restaurant.  at least 3 hours, probably longer.", "No it means you should be spending dinner time together because that's what normal grown adults do when they have family together .\n\nNice red herring though", "I assume you don't have many left in your life so I'd be careful", "Because the plan was to have dinner at 7 so they still had plenty of time to get there.", "Sitting out in the sun makes most people tired", "You must think really highly of yourself if you think you're in any position to be telling others what they should or shouldn't do.", "One quiet morning. All she needs to do is show up with a smile and I'm sure everything will be fine. There's something people do which redditors are skeptical about. It is called \"don't hold a grudge.\"", "That doesn't sound like a healthy way to go about life. Someone says one thing to you and you get mad at everyone and leave, and force your son to leave the vacation as well. That's a lot of anger you've got there.", "Not really fair to expect a 4 year old to be present after a long day of travelling. Kid was probably exhausting. You don\u2019t have to be together 24/7 on a family holiday. Her in-laws just sound narcissistic. Most people would be more than understanding if someone went to bed early the first day they arrived on holiday.", "*shrug first day, traveling with a kid I'd be tired, and I certainly wouldn't expect my family to begrudge me a sleepy. They have the whole rest of their trip to hang, they don't ever even need to eat together. And while I know this is a reach beyond what was stated, it's her holiday too, she can do with it what she wants. I understand that there are extremely limited days off in America (where is assume this took place), too limited to have the whole thing dictated by others needs and wants. \n\nI honestly think this is a case of the SIL feeling entitled to OPs time and energy on OPs holiday.", "It was the first day. The arrival day. Sounds to me like you have been this SIL before", "Who said everything? They wanted the arvo to decompress, seems legit and fine", "Do you have a four year old that you've done five hours of continuous travel with, through airports?", "Time and airspeed work the same on all continents.", "Right, maybe one time zone lol.", ">most successful relationships thrive on good communication and compromise\n\nShe didn't compromise though. She ate a full meal when she could've had a snack and she didn't go to the meal like husband requested.\n\nHusband, on the other hand, *did* communicate what he wanted, and what time he expected it to happen. She didn't use that info to compromise, but rather to do what she wanted.", "Where was her compromise? A compromise would have a snack and a nap.", "Kind of an ironic sentence given the circumstances, don't you think?\n\nOP's husband: communicates dinner time, asks OP to not eat just prior for what should be *very* obvious reasons.\n\nOP: Ignores that, pretends to not know what a snack is, and also doesn't bother going along for the dinner plans that they already knew they had prior to eating in the first place.", "Assuming this is more than a one day vacation - especially since it took a day of travel to get there - there will be more family dinners. \n\nFunctional grown adults can accept when not everyone wants to do all the same things they do.", "Not a red herring lol", "You sound super entitled and like just plain a pain in the \ud83e\udecf", "But they weren\u2019t actually there yet.

Shouldn't the husband's family not be holding a grudge about one single missed dinner when there are most likely several more family dinners happening this week? \n\nI, myself, would probably not leave in the middle of a vacation over one incident.

Please at least use a dictionary when making your terrible insults", "And the world isn't going to fucking end because they missed out on a single goddamn dinner.", "She has the right to. It would look childish, but that's her right.", "What are you even talking about?  A two hour flight will not get you across more than one time zone.  Max.
