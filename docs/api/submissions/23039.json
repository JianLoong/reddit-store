It was around four o'clock, and he was saying we'd eat at seven.\n\nI said I was hungry, and my son and I ate. After that the three of us sat by the pool. His family arrived around six, and everyone was hungry and wanted to go out to eat. I don't know if it was the traveling or what, but I was exhausted, so I said I was too tired and would go to bed early. My son stayed home with me, because he wasn't hungry and wanted to stay.\n\nI woke up early this morning, and I made tea and sat by the pool while my son played. When my sister in law woke up, she came out to the pool and told me off for eating early, not going to dinner and being so standoffish. She said everyone wanted to see me and my son, and I was being such a bitch. I said I was tired from traveling.\n\nShe said if I forced myself to stay awake, I'd be on the same schedule as everyone else, but since I went to bed early and woke up early I was going to have the same excuse tonight. She also told me off for not making breakfast when I was the first to wake up, but I didn't know when everyone was going to wake up, and no one wants cold breakfast. She just rolled her eyes and walked away.\n\nI feel like everyone's been standoffish to me all morning and I'm wondering if I should apologize.

When your body is sending hunger signals you should eat. Waiting 3 hours to do so is ridiculous and unhealthy. And your child\u2019s bedtime would have likely occurred during the time they were out for dinner, so pretty inconsiderate of them to not include that as a factor when choosing a dinner time.\n\nAnd like, these people are adults. They cannot get themselves breakfast? Lol.", "ESH.  I agree with other posters that you could have had a snack, then gone to dinner.  But even if you made a meal, you could have still gone with them.  A family dinner isn\u2019t about food, it\u2019s about time together with the family.  Travel and pool time can both make you tired, but you could have stuck it out to sit with the family for an hour or two.  \n\nHowever, your SIL was wrong to tell you off in such a rude way.  There are better approaches to telling you she\u2019s disappointed that you didn\u2019t join them.  Additionally, it is not your responsibility to make breakfast for everyone just because you\u2019re the first person up.  You don\u2019t know everyone\u2019s morning schedule.  And unless it was planned, breakfast shouldn\u2019t fall on your shoulders.", "NTA why is everyone on a damn schedule the first night. I get that you should spend time together but then to also expect you to make breakfast just because you woke up early? She\u2019s just looking for something to fight about. She\u2019s making assumptions. Vacations are for relaxing not to be on the go. Obviously make time\nFor dinner but it doesn\u2019t have to be every night.", "NTA.  Travelling affects people differently.  Forcing yourself to stay up may work for some, but it doesn't work for everyone.  You did what you needed to do for yourself and your son.  Do not apologize - you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Your SIL is awful!\n\nTravel is hard, especially with a kid.  Some adjust  much more quickly than others.  You should ALWAYS plan on an adjustment day/buffer time depending on how far traveled, if time zone issues.  If don\u2019t need it great, be pleasantly surprised, but plan it.\n\nWhen people are tired they can\u2019t perform social niceties (particularly introverts), that\u2019s not being cold, it\u2019s called I need sleep.\n\nEdit: some ppl can nap others can\u2019t.  It screws me up, way better to just sleep a tad early.  Like if it\u2019s a 6 hour shift, I\u2019ll shift 3-4 hours first night, 2-3 hours next than be percect.  Way better for me than trying to nap or do full 6 hour time shift at once.", "Absolutely NTA. Your SIL was rude beyond reason to you. Shit happens - you got there early and you and your kid were hungry. People should eat, when possible, when they feel hunger. It\u2019s healthiest for your body. Could you have gone to dinner and ordered a salad or a side of fries? Sure - but you were also exhausted from traveling. Everyone knows that the first day of vacation, not the first full one but the arrival day, is all over the place. The fact that she was pissed you didn\u2019t make breakfast cements the point that you needed your rest to deal with these people the rest of the trip. NTA.", "NTA - \n\nI really can\u2019t fathom having someone call me a \u201cbitch\u201d for eating. If anything I\u2019d be a bitch because I get HANGRY. Never mind your son, you didn\u2019t indicate how old he is (may not be relevant) but my girls (4 & 6) are truly awful humans when they are hungry. They must get it from me.", "What's the timeline? You arrived in the afternoon, ate, slept, made yourself breakfast when nobody else was up yet; so maybe 12 to 18 hrs. How long is this vacation? Did you blow the only night you had available? WTF!? It sounds like your in-laws are self-centered and only are satisfied if you play by their rules.\n\nI might understand that they express disappointment at not seeing you at dinner, but \"you should have made everyone breakfast because you woke up first\" is a bit of a leap. Not The Asshole. But if this attitude towards you keeps up, maybe you should be.", "NTA I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your sister in laws place to scold you like a child.\n\nYou have the right to eat and go to bed when you want. Plus if the in laws didn\u2019t arrive till 6 at the earliest you could have eaten would have been 7. Most places are extremely busy at that time. So let\u2019s say you are and came straight home which put you and your son going to bed 9 or 9:30. That\u2019s really hard on a already tired 7 year old after traveling all day. If they didn\u2019t want to take your feelings in to consideration they should have at least took his. \n\n\nAs far as making breakfast for everyone your not a cook or a maid. It\u2019s a family vacation yes, however that should not meant the family dictates every time you eat and sleep. That also means you should not be expected to cook for everyone. Should you help cook? Yes but you didn\u2019t come along to be their maid and cook.\n\nYour husband needs to tell his sister she was way out of line for the ways she spoke to you and for expecting you to be everyone\u2019s cook. This is your vacation also.", "I'm going with ESH, for OP because she was passive aggressive in her behaviour. Yes, I'll buy kid was hungry and tired, and she was. However a tide you over snack at 4pm won't ruin a 7pm dinner, and a quick nap would have freshened both up to go enjoy the evening meal with family. OP chose instead to eat a full meal with her kid, and noped out of a group dinner she was aware of in advance, not as an oops, but because IMO, OP never wanted to go on vacation in a group to begin with. OP didn't *want* to join for dinner, and blew everyone off and went to bed. That's just rude.\n\nSIL sucks for being rude and confrontational first thing in the morning, and, according to OP, OP wasn't aware first one up cooks breakfast is the habit for this family group. If OP didn't know, it's unfair to be belligerent about it. \n\nSIL tho has a point about OP being stubborn about their own sleep/wake schedule and refusing to adjust it to be with the larger group. IMO this is OPs immature way of avoiding attending group meals/events she simply doesn't want to attend. \n\nNext time, just don't go on the group holiday if you don't want to be with the group.", "NTA.  If that was only the first day of your vacation, I imagine you\u2019ll have plenty more opportunities to visit and eat with your husband\u2019s family.  Not joining them for one single meal should not be such a big deal.", "NTA - A family gathering needs to include grace that everyone may not be physically 'ready' to do all scheduled activities. \n\nHer response was hurtful and extreme. At no time did SIL ask if you're feeling better and the family is looking forward to spending time with you and your son.", "NTA You\u2019re an adult & can eat when you are HUNGRY & your child shouldn\u2019t have to suffer because of the \u201cgroup\u201d fuck them. And you should\u2019ve told her & anybody else off for that reason alone.", "NTA but I would have just made a snack to hold me since you knew they were coming. That said she still has no reason to talk to you that way. She is your mother and your not the maid. Small error and now you won\u2019t do it again. Stay up tonight, eat with them and make it a point to talk to everyone. Accept the sister in law of course, just be polite but if she comes for you. Just say that your sorry about eating early and going to bed and it won\u2019t happen again. As for breakfast just say what you said and you weren\u2019t sure what everyone would like. But if they liked they could let you know what and when and you would be happy to make breakfast. Take the high road and make up for missing them that evening.", "Umm\u2026 his family is very needy aren\u2019t they? NTA at all. Yeah it\u2019s a bummer you were tired and couldn\u2019t hang out with them. Oh freaking well.\n\nAlso, who came up with the \u201cfirst person awake cooks breakfast\u201d rule? I guarantee if you\u2019d cooked someone would have bitched about it and wanted to go out to eat instead, or saying you\u2019re too loud because you went to bed early, or whatever. If I were you I\u2019d stay in bed late tomorrow and then ask her why she didn\u2019t make breakfast. But I\u2019m petty like that.", "Planning a big get together with a synched meal schedule on a travel day is an awful idea.", "So IMO, I\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA for feeding your kid. I also think you could of had something at 4 that was more of a snack to keep you going until 7. I\u2019m and early eater too and I would be beyond hangry if I had to wait 3 hours to eat.\n\nHowever I think YTA for how you handled the situation.

Your husband family seems to have travel rules that are not universal, and have never been communicated to you.", "NTA, but your sister in law is made of the same trash your husband and his family are.  You should take the kid and leave. How incredibly abusive to attack you and call you a standoffish bitch.  He probably learned to call you that by your husband, who was undoubtedly badmouthing you all night.", "And this is why you can't travel with everyone", "Yes, YTA - Your husband asked you to wait to eat and go out to dinner with his family. You could have made a light snack and taken a quick nap so that you would be able to participate in the family event. Instead, you had a full meal, sat by the pool (which tends to make you more tired, not less) and then went to bed early.", "NTA. After that conversation who cares that they wanted to see you, you no don't want to see them. They sound used to everyone scheduling themselves around their idea of being an entitled group. \n\nSIL sounds like she was up early enough to cook breakfast. My sympathies, it sounds like it will be a very long vacation. But don't apologize, it will only encourage them to act out more.", "Sorry but you sound pretty self centered and by having your son follow your lead he is going to end up being seen as just an extension of you. I\u2019m not saying that you guys shouldn\u2019t of had a little snack, but to eat a full meal, then just skip out on the family dinner and go to bed early does sound very antisocial.", "When you're vacationing with a group it is obviously polite to participate with the group.

This isn't a solo vacation.\n\nYTA", "NTA vacation is for relaxing.  if your husband didn't care you missed dinner why should she. all thats needed is a lighthearted \"sorry I missed you last night, hope dinner was good...\",  \n\n\n if you skipped out on a helicopter ride and a deposit was made or something, then  I can see being annoyed, but a dinner is no big deal, every family vacation you should have alone time with your own family. enjoy yourself.", "ESH, you could have been more understanding.

The first day/travel day of a vacation is a freebie. No expectations but to settle in, relax, and unwind. I\u2019d reconsider future family vacations if they are so inflexible and rude. Group vacations do not mean you have to do everything as a group. I assume there are several more days of togetherness planned. *yay*\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous the questions being asked- how old is your child? How long did you travel? Why didn\u2019t you have a snack or a nap? Doesn\u2019t matter. No one else gets to judge whether or not you are stressed enough, hungry enough, or tired enough to do what you feel you need to do. \n\nTraveling with a child of any age is stressful- you\u2019re prepping and planning for yourself and them. Maybe you\u2019re hungrier than a snack and maybe you\u2019re not a nap person. (Personally, I\u2019d love to nap but can\u2019t.

I bet not, he would say that since she didn't eat she should deal with the kid.

I'm sure she stayed up for a bit before going to sleep. Plus even if she didn't want to go, their kid could have gone. Everyone came on a family trip. There are times when you are going to be tired, but in these types of events, you just force yourself to be there. Her not caring, obviously means she doesn't care about his family and doesn't want to be there. Why even come and just let her husband and their kids go by themselves.", "Yeah, this is how I see it. Depending on how super close or far away you are both physically and emotionally that first night really sets a tone.

I don't get up that early at home! But, for some reason, I was always awake at 6. However, that didn't affect what time I went to bed; just some nights I had more sleep than others.

I had discussed sleeping arrangements with my mom and was assured that we had a bed. I also knew for a fact how many beds were in the house as well. We get there and my mom had decided to give \"our\" room to my sister's toddler instead of having her sleep in the same room as my sister and brother-in-law. And then instead of having my oldest brother sleep on the spare bed in one of my younger brothers' rooms, he also was given his own room with queen size bed. Leaving my husband and me to sleep on the concrete basement floor with a thin futon mat (couldn't use the futon frame because it was stuck in the upright position). I was pregnant and my husband has compressed discs in his back and my mother knew this perfectly well. It was too late to drive home and my parents live in a very small town so there were no hotels within a decent distance. We pilfered a couple of decorative pillows from upstairs and found a small ratty afghan to share. The next morning, my siblings all opened nice gifts or cards with money in them. My dad presented my husband and I with a wrapped fruit basket, most likely a regift. We left as soon as we politely could. I opened the fruit basket when we got home, and the entire thing was thick with powdery mold. They still wonder why I no longer visit them.", "Exactly what I was thinking, especially with the sil's comment about adjusting which led me to believe they crossed time zones.

I also don't think that everyone has to eat dinner together every night.  It's completely ok to split up, stay behind, or whatever.

Standoffish to eat while they took forever getting to you?  I'd have done the same.\n\nNTA; tell SIL to go to hell and make breakfast for everyone if she cares so much.\n\nThey took their sweet time getting to you, you were hungry so you ate.  You're on vacation, you'll have plenty of time to talk.  I'm sure you'll be able to eat with them the rest of your time together.

No one is on the same schedule. There are various issues with finding a restaurant or even a dinner we can all eat (this is due to various food preferences. For example, his brother\u2019s family is vegan as opposed to his father who is a meat and potatoes person). It turns into a total nightmare to find a place, forever to get there, and forever until bed. \n\nThere was someone on here who mentioned a two hour flight not being an issue. Even in the same time zone, a two hour flight means two hours (or more) at the airport, two hours for the flight and an hour or possibly more getting your luggage and rental car until finally getting to the place where you\u2019re staying. Even being at a pool is not necessarily relaxing depending on the age, energy level, excitement level, or tiredness of the adults and children with you. The entire day is exhausting. \n\nAs to the breakfast, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily make it for the entire family when I woke up. We don\u2019t generally eat breakfast and my kids generally eat cereal. I would start coffee for everyone. That\u2019s really about it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have a cooking schedule discussed and written down before the group vacation so these issues don\u2019t come up.", "NTA.  I hate going out with people that don\u2019t seem to understand that vacation means no schedules that have to be followed.  As for breakfast, she can cook it.  It\u2019s not your responsibility to cook for everyone.", "NTA. Interesting that SIL wants you to be mindful of everyone else\u2019s hunger by going out of your way to make breakfast for them all while on vacation but expects you to have remained hungry to later eat with them? Why is your hunger after traveling less important than her hunger after a full night of sleep? If SIL (or the rest of the family) can't wait long enough to cook their breakfast and eat it, why do you & your son have to wait hours for them to arrive to eat? If anyone should apologize, it's SIL. \n\nNot everyone's internal clock works the same schedule anyway, demanding you adjust yours for a trip that is also your vacation is unnecessary and entitled. Anyone claiming they don't know \u201cjust how tired\u201d OP could be after a 2-hour flight should be mindful that we have no context into her life beyond what she's told us. Not everyone experiences the same level of tiredness or exhaustion even if they do (or have done) the same activities. If someone is vocalizing their needs of being tired (especially on a vacation?), they know themselves best and it should be respected if they want to call it an early night. \n\nI hope you may be able to bring the issue to your husband as I personally think the SIL was out-of-line to attack OP. If you are feeling they are standoffish, it sounds like you have been around them enough to know the difference. And if you haven\u2019t, why is SIL so comfortable being abrasive? \n\nDon\u2019t let her get to you. You know yourself and your intentions better than she ever could. There\u2019s more time ahead and if they are the ones that want to sully it after one night, that\u2019s their prerogative.

She was ready to wake up so she got up. \n\nSIL was way over the line with how she reacted to OP meeting her basic needs. It is disrespectful to expect someone to socialize when they are exhausted.

This is why I don't like going on vacation with other people. Every family has their own schedule / own way of doing things. It's your vacation too. You should be able to eat / relax when you want. If they were decent people, they would respect that. I can see them being disappointed you didn't come, but they should respect that's what you wanted / needed to do.

Breakfasts and lunches are pretty much on your own. Each family is assigned a night to make a dinner of their choosing with one night of going out. On our first night,  it is ALWAYS just sandwiches, and my aunt makes a few salads. Nobody wants to actually cook or deal with going out after traveling all day (in our case, it's usually driving 6 hours AFTER taking a red eye across the country).", "NTA.\n\nBeing forced to eat on someone else\u2019s schedule is NOT a vacation.", "100% NTA!!! \nIf you have been traveling all day, of course you\u2019re going to be exhausted!

Become like water my friend.\u201d - Bruce Lee", "NTA.  These people need to relax.", "NAH \n\nTraveling with kids with ILs differing expectations can be hard.\n\nFor the future and if anyone else has similar arrangements for family vacations, let me share what my family does for that first day when everyone is arriving at different times. We make a dinner meal plan for the week ahead of time where smaller family units have one or two nights (depending on the size of the family) to plan for dinner each night. Units can swap out or the group can decide to go out instead. Last night is leftovers so we get rid of as much as possible or delivery pizza. Everyone is packing and getting an early start the next day so it works for us. We don't plan breakfasts or lunches but we have a list of things that the earlier arrivals go shop for and split the cost of where people can make requests for a few special items to meet dietary needs. People who get up early and love breakfast make coffee and we take turns making a big breakfast that people can nibble on as they wake up - eggs, bacon, sausage, occasional pancakes). Late risers can use leftover stuff for a mid-morning or later omelet. People can make sandwiches or have leftovers from last night's dinner for lunch.\n\nThe night of arrival is sandwich fixings (sub rolls, deli lunchmeat and cheeses, lettuce, tomatoes, etc., bread, PB&J, etc.) with a variety of chips and snacks. Everyone eats when they are hungry and everyone gets acclimated for the week. It is super stressful to plan a meal out with people of all different ages and arrival times for the first night.\n\nIt works for us.", "Hungry adult and small child. Blood sugar comes first. Huuby's relaives are TAs here... OP was just trying to take care of herself and her son, so NTA.", "I can't speak for others, but if I nap any later than like..\n3pm, it throws my whole rhythm off and I'm lucky if I fall asleep for the night any earlier than 1am.", "Lol next time don't worry if you or your kid are hungry or tired. Just ignore everything and everyone. You are on vacation. A time to not worry about yourself at all. Only other people matter on this vacation.", "NTA- you\u2019re traveling with a 4 year old & a husband. I wouldn\u2019t do a family dinner that night either. If you felt you & your son needed to eat & rest then that\u2019s what you do. Everyone getting all this exercise from jumping to conclusions off a small amount of info. Those giving you the cold shoulder will either die or get over it.", "She has a 4 year old. Going to bed early and getting up early is Super normal.", "Are you saying this woman had a full meal and sat by the pool on her vacation? Then she had the audacity to sleep when she was tired?  Wow what a complete asshole! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n/s", "The way OP describes the sister though makes me think it\u2019s exaggerated to try to steer this sub in her favor.", "Does your husband ever stand up for you when his sister treats you like this? I\u2019m asking because  it sounded like she was perfectly comfortable with being an abusive authority figure and talking down to you for a minor thing.\n \nSo yeah, I\u2019m wondering if you have a husband problem here.", "If the bedrooms don\u2019t have en suites, the person with the weakest bladder loses.", "Right? Like, please don't. It's not enjoyable for anybody. Not the rest of the diners at the restaurant, the staff, and certainly not the kid.", "You nor SIL gets to gate-keep who is tired & who is hungry.  It was One meal for Christ\u2019s sake.  If she blew them off ALL vacation, yeah, that\u2019s Weird.  The SIL called her a B*tch on VACATION WTAF?! And if she had made breakfast SiL would have accused her of eating without them AGAIN.", "Travelling with kids is a whole different ball game though. It\u2019s the prep work that goes in to it. For my family, that usually means starting at least 3-4 days early. Do I need to do any last minute shopping? What about housework & washing so I come home to a clean house? Do I have pets that need care? When we arrive, I\u2019m the one who makes sure we have groceries & essentials for the kids. I do all the packing & prep work, I take on all of the mental load as well. The night before we leave is usually a late one. Travelling is physically draining on little kids, and I\u2019m not going to delay feeding my child by 3 hours to accommodate others. It\u2019s also a holiday - I\u2019m entitled to down time as well. \n\nWe were in a similar situation for a family holiday earlier in the year. My SIL (who has no kids) wanted us all to go out for dinner on the first night, but nothing had been planned. Winging it at dinner with little kids isn\u2019t really an option. We had a long day, between packing the car, driving & getting the kids unpacked, then going for a quick swim. I said no, we wanted a quiet evening. SIL was in a foul mood, but thankfully MIL understood because she was the one who took on that role when her kids were little & helped me prep an early, simple dinner for the kids. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed over the years that holidays aren\u2019t really holidays for mums - or at least that\u2019s the expectations that others have. We\u2019re essentially cruise directors & god forbid we take a moment to relax.", "It doesn't matter how long the flight was, how long they traveled, etc.\n\nThe son is 4.\n\nWho the hell goes out to dinner at 7pm with a 4 year old?!\n\nCrazy people who then have miserable, overestimulated, overtired children who then wonder why their kids are monsters the next day.\n\n7pm is time to get toddlers to wind down and get ready for bed.  It's not time to load up in a car, go out to dinner for 1-2hrs, then come home.", "If my kid is hungry, he\u2019s gonna eat. All that blabber-jabber about grown peoples feelings be damned. The plans weren\u2019t even SOLID; these mufuckaz think my son\u2019s going to wait 3 hours while they What If the dinner plans?? Nah, hell no!\n\n MY 12yo son is in a growth spurt & eats half a refrigerator & a box of cereal in 3 hours \ud83e\udd23 EVERY 3 hours \ud83d\ude02", "Nobody gets to decide **for** another person when it's appropriate to be hungry or tired, especially when that other person is an adult.\n\nOP is an entire grownup. She took care of her (and her son's) immediate needs. That was the responsible thing to do, in my opinion. It's not like she was preventing anyone else from doing what they wanted.\n\nThe SIL sounds exhausting. Honestly, everyone but the OP and her son do. They all need to take a look on the mirror and say to themselves **\"worry 'bout yo'self.\"**", "YTA\n\nIt's not nice to make someone come to a restaurant when they are tired and don't want to go. Double this if there's a kid involved. Triple this if there's a kid involved and you're making them starve for 2 hours so they fit on your schedule.\n\nIt's the first day of a multi day vacation. You will have plenty of opportunities to see your nephew. Don't sour them by making a big deal out of this.\n\nShe didn't \"blow you off.\" She and the kid were hungry and tired, so she did the needful. Why are you assuming this is even about you?", "A two-hour flight involves arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure and wrangling the kid.  We don't have any idea how old son is... \n\nWe also don't know how far they live from the airport.  For me, depending on which major airport I use, it's at least 3 hours to one and about 5 hours to the other, so this woman could have been traveling all day.   Why should she force herself to stay awake, it's her vacation too.  Early morning sipping tea as son plays sounds like an awesome way to begin a vacation.  Stay strong OP, enjoy your time and hopefully SIL will calm down.   Oh, and what kind of vacation is it that you're expected to cook?   Go out for breakfast!", "Yes, because SIL, husband, and in-laws are being rude over nothing.  Who wants to fly-in and stay for that privilege coupled with the joy of paying for that and using PTO? Not me.  \n\nOP is NTA.", "She said more than one thing and being cussed out is a dealbreaker", "Of course they do because they\u2019re not the ones effected when the mom has to take the kid outside, to the bathroom, etc\u2026 and be stared at for a screaming kid. They just get to sit there as childless adults and stuff their faces.", "Honestly I more get the vibe that they talked mad shit about OP not being at dinner, and felt empowered/justified in being a huge jerk about it the morning afterward.", "Right. I'm one of those people who has absolutely zero fear of flying, but wild travel anxiety. I have ADHD and find it hard to get places on time, so knowing that getting onto the plane is something with an extremely hard limit and high stakes makes my brain start frying like two days before. Being on the plane itself is an absolute breeze by comparison.", "I hope OP goes petty. Get up early, like stupid early, make breakfast for everyone. Set it up. Then leave it, let it get cold and nasty. When they say something, \"I wasn't sure when everyone would get up, so I just made it when I got up.\"\n\nBut I'm an asshole", "I\u2019d agree but there\u2019s a little kid involved. Idk about OPs kid in particular but MOST 4 year olds need some routine or the entire vacation will be unbearable lol", "Lol. If I let my young children nap at 4 we'd be up all night. Hard pass. I'm not changing my kids sleep schedule dramatically for anyone. Op did nothing wrong.", "You must have never dealt with a four-year-old who usually goes to bed early. I have.

Life was so much better 50 years ago in my time! /s", "Right?? JFC what kind of high maintenance, exhausting families do these people have\u2026 I\u2019m happy I\u2019m from a family where we\u2019re understanding of each others needs and when we\u2019re hanging out together for a few days, there\u2019s no pressure to spend every single moment in each others company. \n\n\u201cYou feel tired?

What kind of monsters want a 4yr old to stay hungry for that duration of time?!?? Ugh people... op did great choosing to take care of herself and son", ">This is why it is important to talk about expectations before the trip\n\nThis is a sensible idea. But in practice, most people don't realize that what they consider to be normal is a weird idiosyncrasy that no one else would expect. \"Everyone knows the first person to wake up makes breakfast.\" is an example of this. Since \"everyone knows\" would OP's husband have thought to mention it to OP?", "Like... Hello meltdowns..", "So the flight is two hours. Add to that packing and check in and then sitting waiting while entertaining a child. Then the flight. Picking up baggage. Keeping track of everyone and everything and getting a ride to where you are staying.

It\u2019s only 3 hours of in air time, but what about the hour of travel time to get to the airport, the 30 minutes before hand to get ready, the hour+ to go through TSA. They literally tell you to arrive at TSA 2 hours before your flight for domestic. Suddenly my three hour flight is close to 6 hours of being gone, plus a two hour time jump. And then, to make it better, DFW is only a layover for me, and will be followed by another 3 hour flight. All in all, the total of 6 hours of flights is actually going to be 12 hours from the first take off to the final touchdown, not including going from PDT to EDT, the drive to/from airports, etc. \n\nThat being said, there are of course some flights that would be simple, such as flying from say Burbank to Las Vegas. It\u2019s really situational based on where op flew from/to.", "For me a two hour flight means a 90 minute ride to get to the airport at least an hour (or 2) before flight time.  Then fly two hours and wait for deboarding.  Claim luggage and travel to accommodations.  With a kid??? I am 100% tired and hungry when I arrive.", "A two hour flight isn't just two hours of travel though, How long did it take to pack? And how long to get to the airport? Was it an international flight? maybe 3-4 hours was spent at the airport itself before departure. Even domestic flights can involve several hours of just existing at the airport right? Any flight delays?? Any timezone changes?\n\nThese are all hypothetical of course, but like, a two hour flight isn't 'just' a two hour flight ya know?\n\nI do see what you're saying though, in all fairness we should consider both sides. But also, travel of anykind can be exhausting, I imagine it's moreso with a kid, its possible op was the one incharge of making sure eveything was in order, perhaps she was up early doing mental checklists and lastminute chores, even if not, not everyone travels with ease, I mean, I know I get exhausted after driving to see my parents and they're only 2.5 hours away from me\n\nIm going NTA for op, I sympathize with travel exhaustion", "It's not just the time in the air though.  It's however long before the flight they had to be at the airport, plus getting to the airport, plus getting from the airport to where they are staying.  And traveling with kids is exhausting.", "It\u2019s not just a two hour flight. Do you have kids? Speaking from experience, us mums get run off our feet before a holiday packing for ourselves, our kids, and sometimes even our partner. There is also the hours long wait at the airport, and then clearing airport security, transferring to your accommodation. It is a loooong day travelling with kids. NTA", "You do realize their is more time in the day than just the two hours traveling. Right? Not to mention for a flight more is involved than just flying like getting to the airport early, getting through security and waiting. Also sometimes delays just on take off and you\u2019re stuck sitting in a shitty plane cabin even longer. \n\nYou don\u2019t know what things OP may have had to do before traveling. Maybe they have body aches and 2 hours is really telling. No way to know. \n\nFirst night of a trip and everyone arriving at different times so yeah, getting desperate dinners actually makes sense while people relax and get settled in lol. \n\nPoint being SIL was out of line and has no real reason to be upset, especially about breakfast.

How long and what is involved in getting him ready and out the door to the airport.\nSo it is possible that OP is tired.", "If my son is hungry and tired . My son is hungry and tired . Mom could of been covering for son which I do for mine all the time. 2 hour flight is still a 2 hour flight . When you have a child .", "Just because the flight is two hours doesn't mean it wasn't a long travel day. Getting everything in the car and driving to the airport, the airport itself, the flight, the new airport, the drive to the hotel, getting the hotel room and unpacking.
