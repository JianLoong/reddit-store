My son stayed home with me, because he wasn't hungry and wanted to stay.\n\nI woke up early this morning, and I made tea and sat by the pool while my son played. When my sister in law woke up, she came out to the pool and told me off for eating early, not going to dinner and being so standoffish. She said everyone wanted to see me and my son, and I was being such a bitch. I said I was tired from traveling.\n\nShe said if I forced myself to stay awake, I'd be on the same schedule as everyone else, but since I went to bed early and woke up early I was going to have the same excuse tonight.

When your body is sending hunger signals you should eat. Waiting 3 hours to do so is ridiculous and unhealthy. And your child\u2019s bedtime would have likely occurred during the time they were out for dinner, so pretty inconsiderate of them to not include that as a factor when choosing a dinner time.\n\nAnd like, these people are adults. They cannot get themselves breakfast? Lol.", "ESH.  I agree with other posters that you could have had a snack, then gone to dinner.  But even if you made a meal, you could have still gone with them.  A family dinner isn\u2019t about food, it\u2019s about time together with the family.  Travel and pool time can both make you tired, but you could have stuck it out to sit with the family for an hour or two.  \n\nHowever, your SIL was wrong to tell you off in such a rude way.  There are better approaches to telling you she\u2019s disappointed that you didn\u2019t join them.  Additionally, it is not your responsibility to make breakfast for everyone just because you\u2019re the first person up.  You don\u2019t know everyone\u2019s morning schedule.  And unless it was planned, breakfast shouldn\u2019t fall on your shoulders.", "NTA why is everyone on a damn schedule the first night. I get that you should spend time together but then to also expect you to make breakfast just because you woke up early? She\u2019s just looking for something to fight about. She\u2019s making assumptions. Vacations are for relaxing not to be on the go. Obviously make time\nFor dinner but it doesn\u2019t have to be every night.", "NTA.  Travelling affects people differently.  Forcing yourself to stay up may work for some, but it doesn't work for everyone.  You did what you needed to do for yourself and your son.  Do not apologize - you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Your SIL is awful!\n\nTravel is hard, especially with a kid.  Some adjust  much more quickly than others.  You should ALWAYS plan on an adjustment day/buffer time depending on how far traveled, if time zone issues.  If don\u2019t need it great, be pleasantly surprised, but plan it.\n\nWhen people are tired they can\u2019t perform social niceties (particularly introverts), that\u2019s not being cold, it\u2019s called I need sleep.\n\nEdit: some ppl can nap others can\u2019t.  It screws me up, way better to just sleep a tad early.  Like if it\u2019s a 6 hour shift, I\u2019ll shift 3-4 hours first night, 2-3 hours next than be percect.  Way better for me than trying to nap or do full 6 hour time shift at once.", "Absolutely NTA. Your SIL was rude beyond reason to you. Shit happens - you got there early and you and your kid were hungry. People should eat, when possible, when they feel hunger. It\u2019s healthiest for your body. Could you have gone to dinner and ordered a salad or a side of fries? Sure - but you were also exhausted from traveling. Everyone knows that the first day of vacation, not the first full one but the arrival day, is all over the place. The fact that she was pissed you didn\u2019t make breakfast cements the point that you needed your rest to deal with these people the rest of the trip. NTA.", "NTA - \n\nI really can\u2019t fathom having someone call me a \u201cbitch\u201d for eating. If anything I\u2019d be a bitch because I get HANGRY. Never mind your son, you didn\u2019t indicate how old he is (may not be relevant) but my girls (4 & 6) are truly awful humans when they are hungry. They must get it from me.", "What's the timeline? You arrived in the afternoon, ate, slept, made yourself breakfast when nobody else was up yet; so maybe 12 to 18 hrs. How long is this vacation? Did you blow the only night you had available? WTF!? It sounds like your in-laws are self-centered and only are satisfied if you play by their rules.\n\nI might understand that they express disappointment at not seeing you at dinner, but \"you should have made everyone breakfast because you woke up first\" is a bit of a leap. Not The Asshole. But if this attitude towards you keeps up, maybe you should be.", "NTA I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your sister in laws place to scold you like a child.\n\nYou have the right to eat and go to bed when you want. Plus if the in laws didn\u2019t arrive till 6 at the earliest you could have eaten would have been 7. Most places are extremely busy at that time. So let\u2019s say you are and came straight home which put you and your son going to bed 9 or 9:30. That\u2019s really hard on a already tired 7 year old after traveling all day. If they didn\u2019t want to take your feelings in to consideration they should have at least took his. \n\n\nAs far as making breakfast for everyone your not a cook or a maid. It\u2019s a family vacation yes, however that should not meant the family dictates every time you eat and sleep. That also means you should not be expected to cook for everyone. Should you help cook? Yes but you didn\u2019t come along to be their maid and cook.\n\nYour husband needs to tell his sister she was way out of line for the ways she spoke to you and for expecting you to be everyone\u2019s cook. This is your vacation also.", "I'm going with ESH, for OP because she was passive aggressive in her behaviour. Yes, I'll buy kid was hungry and tired, and she was. However a tide you over snack at 4pm won't ruin a 7pm dinner, and a quick nap would have freshened both up to go enjoy the evening meal with family. OP chose instead to eat a full meal with her kid, and noped out of a group dinner she was aware of in advance, not as an oops, but because, her words, she \"hates group holidays\" and IMO never wanted to go on vacation in a group to begin with. OP didn't *want* to join for dinner, and blew everyone off and went to bed. That's just rude.\n\nSIL sucks for being rude and confrontational first thing in the morning, and, according to OP, OP wasn't aware first one up cooks breakfast is the habit for this family group. If OP didn't know, it's unfair to be belligerent about it. \n\nSIL tho has a point about OP being stubborn about their own sleep/wake schedule and refusing to adjust it to be with the larger group. IMO this is OPs immature way of avoiding attending group meals/events she simply doesn't want to attend. \n\nNext time, just don't go on the group holiday if you don't want to be with the group.", "NTA.  If that was only the first day of your vacation, I imagine you\u2019ll have plenty more opportunities to visit and eat with your husband\u2019s family.  Not joining them for one single meal should not be such a big deal.", "NTA - A family gathering needs to include grace that everyone may not be physically 'ready' to do all scheduled activities. \n\nHer response was hurtful and extreme. At no time did SIL ask if you're feeling better and the family is looking forward to spending time with you and your son.", "NTA You\u2019re an adult & can eat when you are HUNGRY & your child shouldn\u2019t have to suffer because of the \u201cgroup\u201d fuck them. And you should\u2019ve told her & anybody else off for that reason alone.", "NTA but I would have just made a snack to hold me since you knew they were coming. That said she still has no reason to talk to you that way. She is your mother and your not the maid. Small error and now you won\u2019t do it again. Stay up tonight, eat with them and make it a point to talk to everyone. Accept the sister in law of course, just be polite but if she comes for you. Just say that your sorry about eating early and going to bed and it won\u2019t happen again. As for breakfast just say what you said and you weren\u2019t sure what everyone would like. But if they liked they could let you know what and when and you would be happy to make breakfast. Take the high road and make up for missing them that evening.", "Umm\u2026 his family is very needy aren\u2019t they? NTA at all. Yeah it\u2019s a bummer you were tired and couldn\u2019t hang out with them. Oh freaking well.\n\nAlso, who came up with the \u201cfirst person awake cooks breakfast\u201d rule? I guarantee if you\u2019d cooked someone would have bitched about it and wanted to go out to eat instead, or saying you\u2019re too loud because you went to bed early, or whatever. If I were you I\u2019d stay in bed late tomorrow and then ask her why she didn\u2019t make breakfast.

I also think you could of had something at 4 that was more of a snack to keep you going until 7. I\u2019m and early eater too and I would be beyond hangry if I had to wait 3 hours to eat.\n\nHowever I think YTA for how you handled the situation.

Your husband family seems to have travel rules that are not universal, and have never been communicated to you.", "NTA, but your sister in law is made of the same trash your husband and his family are.  You should take the kid and leave. How incredibly abusive to attack you and call you a standoffish bitch.  He probably learned to call you that by your husband, who was undoubtedly badmouthing you all night.", "And this is why you can't travel with everyone", "Yes, YTA - Your husband asked you to wait to eat and go out to dinner with his family. You could have made a light snack and taken a quick nap so that you would be able to participate in the family event. Instead, you had a full meal, sat by the pool (which tends to make you more tired, not less) and then went to bed early.", "NTA. After that conversation who cares that they wanted to see you, you no don't want to see them. They sound used to everyone scheduling themselves around their idea of being an entitled group. \n\nSIL sounds like she was up early enough to cook breakfast. My sympathies, it sounds like it will be a very long vacation. But don't apologize, it will only encourage them to act out more.", "Sorry but you sound pretty self centered and by having your son follow your lead he is going to end up being seen as just an extension of you. I\u2019m not saying that you guys shouldn\u2019t of had a little snack, but to eat a full meal, then just skip out on the family dinner and go to bed early does sound very antisocial.", "When you're vacationing with a group it is obviously polite to participate with the group.  I can see giving your kid a snack to hold him over until dinner, but you are an adult.  Yes, you were rude.  This isn't a solo vacation.\n\nYTA", "NTA vacation is for relaxing.  if your husband didn't care you missed dinner why should she. all thats needed is a lighthearted \"sorry I missed you last night, hope dinner was good...\",  \n\n\n if you skipped out on a helicopter ride and a deposit was made or something, then  I can see being annoyed, but a dinner is no big deal, every family vacation you should have alone time with your own family. enjoy yourself.", "ESH, you could have been more understanding.

Lol scheduled vacation? Good luck to your SIL. My family regularly goes up to a summer home on a lake and getting everyone to eat and/or sleep at the same time is like herding cats.

It's even worse with the kids. \n\nI probably would have sucked it up and gone to the dinner, even if I was tired, but I can understand not wanting your son to get overtired because kids get difficult when they're overtired.

The first day/travel day of a vacation is a freebie. No expectations but to settle in, relax, and unwind. I\u2019d reconsider future family vacations if they are so inflexible and rude. Group vacations do not mean you have to do everything as a group. I assume there are several more days of togetherness planned. *yay*\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous the questions being asked- how old is your child? How long did you travel? Why didn\u2019t you have a snack or a nap? Doesn\u2019t matter. No one else gets to judge whether or not you are stressed enough, hungry enough, or tired enough to do what you feel you need to do. \n\nTraveling with a child of any age is stressful- you\u2019re prepping and planning for yourself and them. Maybe you\u2019re hungrier than a snack and maybe you\u2019re not a nap person. (Personally, I\u2019d love to nap but can\u2019t. Either my mind won\u2019t shut off to let me rest or I sleep so hard I\u2019m out for 3 hours and wake up disoriented not knowing what century it is. And, ironically, more tired than when I started.)\n\nAs an adult, you\u2019re not asking for permission or approval to eat and sleep when you need/want. Their preferences do not trump your own.

Yikes. NTA. Though your nasty SIL would probably have a problem with you not being cheery if you had gone out.\n\nPlus while it does make sense to try to align your day with the others, a travel day is a good exception to make. Her telling you off because of course you\u2019re going to do it again is ridiculously overbearing. It\u2019s also the sort of claim that gives you the dilemma of feeding into \u201csee I knew you would\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s good that you listened to me\u201d future claims by your SIL. I hate people who pull that.", "How long have you been married and missed the fact your in laws at AH?  NTA", "NTA OP arrived early they didn\u2019t know when the rest of the family was arriving.

After a 4 hour trip, maybe 5-6 depending on how early you need to be at the airport, you suddenly need to have a full dinner at 4 instead of getting a snack and a nap waiting for your companions to arrive? Is this your normal dinner time?\n\nYou clearly don't want to be on this trip. \n\nYou did however agree to go on this trip. \n\nThe best you can do now is pretend to like it. Act as if you want to be there. Go through the motions. You can do this for your child's sake, and your husband's! Just smile and think of something else. That will make the holiday ok for them and you will not ruin it for them.\n\nThen never go on a group holiday again. \n\nYTA.", "She says it in the comments.", "Regarding the son, yes he is still not his own boss, but my point was she didn't ask or suggest he stayed, that was HIS decision and she merely said 'yes.' \"Taking part in things like family meals\" does not require 100% required attendance; thay just traveled, she was tired. They'll see them tomorrow, what's the beef? A family vacation can't handle changing circumstances?"]}
