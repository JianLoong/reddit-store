A couple years ago his daughter and her son met and got in a relationship together, the two got serious and before long they introduced their parents (so my neighbours) to each other. My neighbours fell in love as well and moved in to the house next to me. At the time I kept silent about the fact I found their relationship morally questionable because I didn't think it to be my place to interfere in their affairs. However, recently they announced their intention to get married (not just a ceremony of love, but an actual legal marriage, my country sees a difference between the two) and they announced they wanted to do a joint wedding with their children. Everyone aware of the full situation seems to think it's an amazing sentiment that the to couples who couldn't have existed without each other are getting married on the same day. I however, can only see that they are legally making their children siblings on the same day their children are getting married. I understand that you cannot control who you love, and I would have been fine with them doing a celebration of love (even a joint one), but the fact both couples are getting legally married I think is just morally wrong.\nWhen I voiced this opinion to my neighbours (in a private conversation, I didn't make a big scene) they got mad at me and said I was being ridiculous.\n\nWas I?", "created_utc": 1689625298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152cu1j/aita_for_telling_my_neighbours_i_think_there/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
