A couple years ago his daughter and her son met and got in a relationship together, the two got serious and before long they introduced their parents (so my neighbours) to each other. My neighbours fell in love as well and moved in to the house next to me. At the time I kept silent about the fact I found their relationship morally questionable because I didn't think it to be my place to interfere in their affairs. However, recently they announced their intention to get married (not just a ceremony of love, but an actual legal marriage, my country sees a difference between the two) and they announced they wanted to do a joint wedding with their children. Everyone aware of the full situation seems to think it's an amazing sentiment that the to couples who couldn't have existed without each other are getting married on the same day. I however, can only see that they are legally making their children siblings on the same day their children are getting married. I understand that you cannot control who you love, and I would have been fine with them doing a celebration of love (even a joint one), but the fact both couples are getting legally married I think is just morally wrong.\nWhen I voiced this opinion to my neighbours (in a private conversation, I didn't make a big scene) they got mad at me and said I was being ridiculous.\n\nWas I?", "created_utc": 1689625298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152cu1j/aita_for_telling_my_neighbours_i_think_there/", "score": 679, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no legal status that exists called \"step children\" or \"step parents\"\n\nYou have no legal familial relationship with step children where I'm from unless you go through the process of adopting them, at which point they become your kids on a par with your biological kids. Otherwise, no, the law doesn't recognise you as having a distinct relationship.", "I\u2019ve got 4 step-sisters. I was already a mother of two when our parents married. Can\u2019t even recall all their names off the top of my head. Perfectly lovely people, the handful of times I met them, but I just don\u2019t know them at all.  \n\nI do call them my step-sisters, if I\u2019m referring to them, because it is just easier than \u201cmy dad\u2019s wife\u2019s kids.\u201d", "I would like for you to imagine the line being delivered in a very strong but articulate Southern American Atlantic Tidewater accent, (*not* that Foghorn Leghorn shit everyone outside of the south *thinks* is a Southern accent) with a menthol cigarette hanging out of her mouth and house slippers that I **know** had some kind of homing device attached. I swear to God she could no-scope headshot anyone with that thing.", "My grandmother did the opposite\u2026.had to be born of her uterus to inherit. Not sure of the legal term used but I have no step aunts/uncles so it didn\u2019t matter.", "Good for them. That is how things should be, since she became part of your family when you got married. Family is stronger than just blood and often better.", "No, it makes nothing complicated. If you have a child and you marry someone who has a child, those 2 children have no legal relationship to each other, your spouse\u2019s child has no legal relationship to you and your spouse has no legal relationship to your child.", "There is no situation. There is no legal relationship at all. It doesn\u2019t even matter if the children are minors. \u201cStep\u201d isn\u2019t a legal relationship.", "In THIS economy?", "Bahahahahahaa!!! Yessss", "Oh I'm stealing this XD"]}
