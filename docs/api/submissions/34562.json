He surprised me with a proposal in the last day of our holiday together and I said yes. He got me a gold ring with a big diamond and a halo around it. I love him and do want to marry him, but I saw the ring was gold and I wear silver jewellery. \n\nI have put off wearing it as I work with my hands at my job so can\u2019t wear jewellery then, but Ted asked me why I don\u2019t really wear the ring and I told him it wasn\u2019t really my style. The ring is very obviously expensive and gaudy IMO but it has stones from his grandma\u2019s engagement ring and a family heirloom so I didn\u2019t want to upset him. I love that he wanted to include that in the ring but a bit disappointed that he designed this ring with me in mind but it\u2019s not something I\u2019d wear and I feel he doesn\u2019t really know me as well as I thought he did.\n\nHe kept pressing on why I wouldn\u2019t wear the ring so I snapped and said it\u2019s gaudy and not my taste.

But if you want to marry him, you have to learn how to have these difficult conversations.  YTA for snapping at him.  Also, I'm not sure about puting diamonds into silver, as I believe silver is softe and you could lose them.  (could be wrong).  Maybe change the gold band for white gold.  Communicate and find a solution together.", "My friend was honest and told her fianc\u00e9 she only wears silver/silver look jewellery after he proposed with yellow gold. \n\nBut you\u2019re confusing. You said it was metal colour, then too gaudy, is it one, the other, or both?\n\nIf it\u2019s just metal colour, have it redone in white gold or platinum. If it\u2019s too gaudy, that\u2019s a bigger issue but fixable.\n\nHe needs the assurance you want to marry him! But it\u2019s a permanent piece of jewellery and you need to be happy with it.", "NTA. Noticing whether your person wears silver or gold is a big thing to miss when you're the one designing a proposal ring. I've seen other posts about women being upset that their partner gets them the reverse of what they wear and no one thinks they're the ahole. The problem here is because it's an engagement ring. but for me, that makes it worse, tbh. On HIS end. He got diamonds from an heirloom piece, designed a ring, but in all that time he didn't think to, I don't know, see what kind of precious metal you prefer to wear? Or maybe look at what kind of stuff you wear or talk to a friend about it?\n\nThis is the problem with surprise proposals. They come off in someone's head as some big grand gesture, but if they get zero input in the important parts of it, like the jewelry they want their person to wear, then there's going to be hurt feelings when they swing and miss so hard. He whiffed on this. Wrong metal. Wrong style. If you like silver and he wanted gold, he should have gone with white gold. Or platinum. I hate gold myself, so I know about the alternatives that are stronger than silver and don't tarnish so easily. The style itself is also something that he seems to have done more for himself than you.\n\nIf someone is giving someone something they want them to wear, especially if it's an engagement ring, the bare minimum to do is figure out style. Especially if you're someone that works with their hands. He's hurt, but he could have avoided it by doing ANY research. With a friend. Family member. Or just hinting around and asking about your favorite cuts and stuff. He went in blind and it's no wonder he missed.\n\nHave a discussion with him if you can and he's open to it. Suggest to keep the stones, but maybe you can both go look at settings that are more sedate for you. Unless this hurt his butt so bad, he's rethinking it. But I wouldn't say that's on you. This whole thing was handled badly on his end, imo.", "YTA - simply put, just use your words. \n\nYou dont have to like it. So say that. Snapping at him is an AH thing to do.", "YTA. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d put off wearing it, ignore him asking why, and then snap and say it\u2019s gaudy. It sounds like you\u2019re not mad that it\u2019s gold, you\u2019re more annoyed he didn\u2019t get it \u201cright\u201d the first time.", "IMO, the real AH is the tradition of surprising a potential bride with her engagement ring, an item she\u2019s expected to wear for the rest of her life.\n\nThe way my now-husband did it is best: as soon as we started talking engagement, he took me out to three different jewelers and all we did was look. He showed me which options were in his budget, I showed him which ones I liked (all of my choices were white gold/platinum btw bc yellow/rose gold is also a no-go for me). So he knew the metal/cut/style and ultimately chose from one of the options I liked. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that you two didn\u2019t have the foresight to discuss this/go window shopping together beforehand, then this whole situation could\u2019ve been avoided.", "Honestly these things just got to be discussed before hand.\n\nI'm not involved OP. Just saying what I've learned.", "yta\n\nI can\u2019t tell you dislike it because it\u2019s gaudy or because it\u2019s gold.\n\nGold can be easily resolved by plating it into white gold. You can\u2019t be allergic to gold and not to silver so it probably just a personal preference.\n\nIt is an heirloom piece? Or he made it specially for you? But honestly either ways you have put your foot right in your mouth.", "Yta. You're both going to mess up at times in this marriage, even if the intentions are pure. It's how you handle it that matters. He gave you a gold ring. Sulking, deflecting when he asks what's wrong then snapping at him is childish. I'm not trying to be a dick here, just stating a fact - with most men, you only get to do that so many times before they get sick of your shit. Go apologize to him, show him you appreciate the effort, explain to him what you don't like about the ring, what he can do to fix it, and gently discuss how nice it would have been if he'd put more effort into learning about your style (he can ask one of your friends for help if needed) before committing to a purchase like that. Behaving the way you're doing right now is a poor way to start a marriage", "You are not an AH for liking silver over gold but YTA for not being up front to the point you snapped and insulted your fiance. You should gave told him immediately that the metal wasn't your exact taste and been nice about it. Geez.", "ESH - you should have had a mature conversation about the ring beforehand if it was going to be so important to you on how it looks. Most people I know talk with their partners about what they want their ring to look like before the proposal. Clearly this didn\u2019t happen, so I don\u2019t think you can fully blame your fianc\u00e9 for this. That being said, kinda weird your bf didn\u2019t know you wear silver or what your style is after dating for so long. Him being a man (as some folks have stated) is not an excuse imo. His ring does sound thoughtful though, regardless of the metal, as it\u2019s custom-made and family-focused. Overall, this honestly sounds like a huge lack of communication on both sides.", "NAH -- This is a really frustrating situation. I hate the forced surprise element of proposals for this exact reason: a lot of proposers don't pay attention to or ask what the proposee wants. You cannot be expected to wear a piece of jewelry you don't like for the rest of your life. (BTW, I've seen people use placeholder rings if they insist on a surprise! Great idea!) It's sweet that he used family heirlooms, but it would have been sweeter to ask you what you want! \n\nI think it would be helpful to share what you're feeling. Apologize for snapping at him, appreciate the effort and finances he committed, and express that you want to marry him. Also express that you want to wear the ring for the rest of your life and you'd love to create something together (using the family diamonds) that you'll love wearing.", "nta - i really believe that women should choose their engagement rings after the proposal. at the end of the day if you don\u2019t like you don\u2019t like it. how he didn\u2019t realise you only wear silver is beyond me", "NTA. If he knew you well enough to decide he wanted to propose to you and spend the rest of his life with you, he should know enough about you and your preferences including what type of jewellery you wear. \n\nI would personally feel upset that the supposed love of my life doesn\u2019t a) know me well and isn\u2019t paying enough attention in our relationship to even notice that detail and b) wouldn\u2019t even have the thought process to consider/research my preferences when designing a ring. It\u2019s not just about the money and material value, it\u2019s about knowing what would bring your partner joy which should ultimately bring you joy to see them happy.", "You can get it rhodium coated", "NTA\n\nThis is an important piece of jewellery and you don't want to wear it because he failed to discuss style with you.\n\nCan you get it re-made to include the important jewels but in a style you like?", "ESH, but personally I think he\u2019s a bigger AH, if you\u2019ve never seen your partner wear gold jewellery why would you get them a gold ring that they\u2019re expected to wear everyday for the rest of their life? It\u2019s really not that difficult to pay attention to what your partner likes to wear and if you can\u2019t even manage that then you\u2019re not ready to be married to this person. \n\nBut when he asked you why you weren\u2019t wearing it the first time you should\u2019ve just told him you didn\u2019t like the ring and it wasn\u2019t your style, no need to try and hide it and then snap at him. But I do understand your frustration, you\u2019ve likely spoken about marriage before and may have been looking forward to it so a ring that just shows how little ted knows you would be a disappointment.", "This is a tough one but I gotta say NTA. If Ted is with you everyday he should notice what kind of jewelry you wear. My fianc\u00e9 has bought me jewelry before and he knows that I only wear silver, so he bought me a silver ring. Plus, not for nothing, but gold only looks good on certain people lol", "I don\u2019t love my engagement ring, but I love my man, and that\u2019s all that matters to me. I wear my ring with pride.", "Eta. You will never be the asshole for not wanting to wear a ring for the rest of your life that you find ugly as hell.  That said you should have communicated this to him immediately.", "YTA. While it's understandable to feel disappointed about the engagement ring not being what you envisioned, it's crucial to consider the sentiment and effort your fianc\u00e9 put into choosing it. Expressing your feelings in a kinder and more considerate manner, rather than using derogatory terms, would have been more respectful. As for your feeling, that he really doesn't know you, I'm sure he's thinking the same thing about you right now.", "NTA-I worked for a jewelry store for several years and ANY time a man came in to look at engagement rings or to talk about designing an engagement ring, we always \u201cguided\u201d him.  We asked specific questions such as \u201cdoes she wear white or yellow gold\u201d, \u201cdoes she wear bold jewelry or does she prefer dainty jewelry\u201d, \u201chave y\u2019all talked about what style ring or which shaped center stone she prefers\u201d, etc.  If he didn\u2019t have any idea what SHE liked, we would even look at her Pinterest boards to see if she had anything saved.  We always found a way to \u201chelp\u201d him pick out or design the perfect ring for her.  As women, we understood the importance of this ring and would gently guide him to creating the perfect look for her.  Of course, we never did this in a way to offend our customer!  I say all this to say, too bad he didn\u2019t have anyone to guide him.  \n\nSorry-first time responding and I get wordy. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA...he should probably know you better", "In my opinion, NAH, because this is a RIDICULOUS thing tradition in our culture, that someone else chooses a piece of jewelry we are supposed to wear every day for the rest of our lives.\n\nIn my opinion, this is right up there with the idea of proposals as well. We're a couple and make important decisions together but when it comes to this huge commitment, I have to wait for you to \"pop the question\"? No thanks.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he's not given any thought to whether the ring would fit YOUR style and tastes. If he's never seen you wear gold jewellery, why would he get you gold jewellery? Even if you SOMETIMES would wear gold, I'd still think it would be considerate to get silver is that is what you wear most of the time (or another silver tone metal), as he will expect you to want to wear this ring for a long time, right?\n\nI understand he's upset, though, but I think he is at fault here for not considering your style/tastes.", "Reassure him that you want to marry him, but you are saddened at how he\u2019d missed a big detail about you, as someone who exclusively wears silver and not gold. ESH, the fianc\u00e9 pressed for a response likely out of insecurity about the relationship, but OP snapped out of frustration about the ring rather than responding to that. Everyone\u2019s valid in their feelings, you both just need to learn to talk it out and you\u2019ll be fine.", "NTA \n\nMy boyfriend and i have had several conversations about rings, and he knows by now, that I don't wear gold jewelry. We're talking about marriage, and in conversations he has stated to me that he would like to have a gold ring when we get married, but knows I will wear silver and has even asked me to show him photos of rings that I really like, so that he can pick something really special when it comes time to buy my engagement ring.\n\n Every piece of jewelry he's ever bought for me was very well thought out, for example, a bracelet he bought me for my birthday 2 yesrs ago, that is silver, very dainty, with little sunflowers on it, that are gold with a little stone in the center (the rest of the bracelet being silver, the gold only serving as an accent since sunflowers are yellow). It fits me, and my style perfectly, and he knew how to pick it for me after only 6 months of being together, and before we ever talked about preference on precious metals. He just observed my earring, ring, and necklace choices, and made a very good choice on something that I now wear every day. Your fiance obviously went through a long process to design this ring for you, and i do think you should be appreciative of the thought he put into it, but he should've paid more attention to your personal style when buying you something you will literally wear for the rest of your life.", "NTA. This is a very significant piece of jewellery - he didn\u2019t do enough research to work out what you like before spending that money. I would\u2019ve been disappointed too and would feel like my bf doesn\u2019t really know me. \n\nMy husband proposed with the diamond he knew I wanted on a temporary placement band. We then went and got the actual ring designed together. My friend had a ring designed with her fianc\u00e9 and he went behind her back and changed it thinking he was doing her a favour, she hated it. They\u2019ve been married for 18 years and she still won\u2019t wear it\u2026", "NTA \n\nIf it\u2019s the thought that counts then he should\u2019ve thought about what you *actually* wear\n\nIt\u2019s his fault for wasting money because he can\u2019t be bothered to notice the kind of jewelry you wear. Hell there are even subtle ways to ask if he was really unsure \n\nHonestly getting the ring wrong is a red flag, because if you\u2019re going to ask someone to spend the rest of their life with you, you should know what kind of jewelry they like. \n\nLike my husband isn\u2019t a jewelry guy, but he\u2019s a huge fan of military history. His wedding ring includes metal from a WWII tank and wood from a rifle stock. He\u2019s obsessed with it. That\u2019s the reaction someone should have towards their wedding/engagement ring because you\u2019re supposed to wear it for the rest of your life\n\nOnly way you\u2019d be the AH is if it was the exact ring that was his grandmothers but considering you called out the gems specially that means he picked the setting and arrangement or at least ok\u2019d what the jeweler suggested", "I love that you give me a ring and I love that your grandmothers diamond is part of it and I love that history but I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s possible to get it reset with white gold or platinum as that\u2019s what I normally wear. I also generally wear some thing a little simpler. Can we go together and decide something we\u2019re both happy with?", "Just gave the setting changed to white gold. Easy fix", "NTA. And to be fair, the jeweller missed the mark here by not asking the right questions and making sure it\u2019s a ring that you\u2019d love.

On one hand it sounds like a dick thing to say that you don't like the ring because it's gold, but they should know you well enough to know what jewellery you like.", "NTA - I listened very carefully to everything my girlfriend told me about the styles she liked I showed her multiple pictures of styles and used all that to find her the perfect ring that she would love. She's the one who has to wear it, and it's for her I want her to love it.", "NTA\n\nYou told him it wasn't your style and he pushed. \n\nA sliver engagement necklace would have been a better option than a ring.", "NTA.

Are we just supposed to pretend to like it? Change our entire style to fit that ring?\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to hate your ring because it\u2019s not expensive enough, but it\u2019s entirely different if it\u2019s nothing like you imagined, hinted at or even close to your style.

However I have seen multiple clients get so blinded by the idea of what everyone else(usually a mother, best friend, or some other person who insists they know best)  thinks the engagement ring should look like. I've also seen multiple clients who have an idea of what they themselves envision their fiance wearing and not taking into consideration that they aren't wearing the ring. \n\nI'm willing to bet that your SO falls into one of these categories. I'm so sorry that's happened! If you decide to get a different setting that is white gold then get your jeweler to use the gold from this ring into your new one and that way you still have the same gold, just a different alloy. Best way to solve this problem lol! NTA", "NTA - your partner doesn\u2019t have to get/design you the perfect ring. But knowing what color metal you wear is pretty freaking basic.

What an idiot lol sorry", "YTA for snapping. Have a conversation and talk about your thoughts don't let them boil over into anger. Communication is important", "NTA.

So I feel like he didn't tell them you wear silver jewelry. \n\n\nYou already told him that it wasn't your style and he pushed further, almost like he *wanted* you to really let him have it. He should have asked your friends/family/etc to get ideas on what type of jewelry you'd like in the first place, which it doesn't sound like he did. Maybe you would have liked a more modest size diamond with a low profile setting with maybe some stones on the side so that all the attention isn't just a center stone?

Sure, the big gesture, but what is the big gesture worth if the other person barely took into account what you like/want/prefer? It is really not much to ask. He had time to plan the proposal, he could have spent some to figure out what you would have liked, *especially* since it is an engagement ring.\n\nMaybe you worded it the wrong way, but I think it's perfectly understandable that you are somehow upset about not liking the ring. Possible solution: you can suggest you go to a goldsmith *together* and have the ring reworked in a way that both of you like", "NTA\n\nYou can get gold jewelry plated with white gold relatively easily.  \nOr perhaps have the jewels reset in a silver / white gold setting.", "My husband and I had a ring discussion before he proposed and it boiled down to this: if I'm the one wearing it - attached to it - for LIFE, then it needs to be something I want. It's horrendous to expect women to just be thankful and then prominently display something they don't want. It's rife with sexism and can breed resentment. \n\nUltimately, since I still wanted some surprise factor, I picked out multiple options and he picked from those and it was a great decision, which is good because, again, this is for life, and it's my body. \n\nMaybe he didn't inquire in advance, or maybe neither of you had the difficult decision in advance. But now, it's totally possible to sit with a jeweler and discuss how it can be repurposed into a new ring. You can't go through the rest of your life hating what's on your hand. That's way too much. If you expected him to get it right without input, then that is a little bit on you. If you wanted to have input and he kept it to himself then that's all on him. But regardless all that matters is going forward. What matters to him about it? The heirloom pieces? They can be put on a new ring. Work with an expert, redesign together, keep what's important.

Communication is key and your fianc\u00e9 lacks that very badly.  An engagement ring is VERY important to a woman and a man should NEVER surprise her with one without knowing what she actually wants.  \n\nAnyway, your fianc\u00e9 kept pressing you and pressing you why you weren't wearing it and it was okay to tell him the truth.  If you don't like it, you don't like it.  It's pretty simple, he screwed up.  He has only himself to be mad at since he obviously doesn't know you that well.

One of the things I've never understood is people who date, maybe vaguely discuss marriage and then either expect a surprise proposal outta nowhere or people who surprise propose to people out of nowhere with very little forethought or a prior concrete agreement about marriage.\n\nProposal as just the  formal part can be a surprise. But it's never a good idea to decide to marry someone as a big surprise where it's never really been thoroughly discussed. Life isn't a rom com and I suspect many people are enamored by the grand gesture and the romantic nature of proposals with little thought about everything else marriage means. You wouldn't surprise have a baby or come home with an adopted kid, so not sure why people surprise propose (if it is indeed that the marriage aspects were never fully detailed). \n\nThat your fianc\u00e9 doesn't even know what kinda jewelry you like, didn't seek input from you, or even things like asking your best friend or sister(s) if you have any, just feels like he's more into the gesture and romantic fantasy of it all as opposed to being truly ready to have a wife where major things are discussed as a team. \n\nI had an ex who bought me a diamond heart necklace, hated it.

Instead of being in their ego, they actually wanted me to be happy and have something I would wear and were happy to take me to get something else.

He clearly values you enough to get you something he views as valuable. He may just in general not be observant of details like the metals you wear in your jewelry, and was focusing on buying what he saw as the \"best quality.\" Gold and a \"gaudy\" diamond have more value in terms of money and longevity than sterling silver, not to mention the infinite sentimental value of adding diamonds from the rings of the mother figures in his life...plus, at the end of the day, if he went through the trouble of getting this ring custom designed, he can always just take it back to the jeweler's and have it reset in silver.

If not, I do think it would kind of be odd to expect him to know that you *only* wear silver; unless you have a reaction to gold jewelry which I'm guessing isn't the case.

There are many reasons why he could have made the choice, and it\u2019s not necessarily because he was being thoughtless and oblivious.  Bottom line, her reaction was childish and definitely shows that she\u2019s not ready for marriage.", "Yeah, nothing says cheap like heirloom diamonds.", "He may have wanted to surprise her with the proposal, and genuinely felt that he didn't have to ask because he thought he *had* come up with something she was going to love. Maybe he asked someone for assistance and they steered him wrong.\n\nMistakes happen, and not always for lack of effort or care.", "An engagement ring isn\u2019t offered up as a gift to suit the wearers preference. An engagement ring is a symbol of intent. Refusing to wear it because it\u2019s not the right style after so much thought was put into the gesture is rude and childish.", "Its chill I addressed many points, tho it sounds like OP was fine with the diamonds in general, it was the setting that threw her in a loop. Honestly I think the fiance got her a big, fancy ring despite it not fitting his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s life style bc it is what is expected of men in society. He probably would have been fine if she had told him from the get go, \u201cyeah this ring design is impractical for me, can we please have it reset\u201d. Honestly this is good for their relationship bc this event addresses how key communication is, especially for important, lasting decisions.", "I think we disagree about discussion here. He seemed hurt that she wasn\u2019t wearing the ring\u2026 and she wouldn\u2019t explain why. She should learn the communicate and then they should both take that communication and deal with the problems. Part of this discussion can even be him not noticing what sort of jewelry she wears.", "He kept pushing because she wouldn't tell him why she wouldn't wear it.", "He kept pushing because she wasn't honest with him.   It's normal to wonder why your fiance isn't wearing their engagement ring.  If she can't have uncomfortable conversations with him,  or is too scared to upset him, or whatever,  then she's not ready to be married and/or they're not a good match.   I voted ESH because he designed a ring without bothering to pay attention to what she'd like,  and she didn't bother just sitting down and talking to him about it.", "Wouldn't you push too?... The Man spent about 5 months of his salary on that ring... I'm pretty sure he was under the impression she would wear it..", "If these people can't have a calm and rational conversation about this ring, maybe they should rethink the marriage.  Good grief.  Try \"oh my gosh, I love you so much, I'm so touched you put so much work into this ring, and it's lovely.  It's just, I only wear silver jewelry,  and I always go for a much simpler style, I'm sorry I an not in love with this ring, but I'm absolutely over the moon in love with you, do you think we could find a way to fix the ring? Or do something different and keep this one for our future children?\"\n\nThis said when he asked the true reason she didn't wear it.. I mean, it's not that hard YTA op you were cruel", "Because she wouldn\u2019t give a straight answer for what is an extremely reasonable question. Dodging the question a million times and then snapping is toxic communication at its finest.", "I definitely wouldn't want a giant diamond ring. I want simple, and silver. How do you not know what your partner wants? Surely they've had ring discussions before on style and if not, how do you not notice she only wears silver?", "And he didn't even do that much. Just bought her a lemon in the wrong colour and is upset when she's not driving everywhere in it.", "As someone who has very strong opinions about vehicle colours, I'd be second guessing my relationship if my SO surprised me with a new car in a colour I don't like...  Any large gift should take the receiver's preferences into consideration.\n\nAnd in regards to my opinion on car colours, white gets way too dirty in the winter, and dark greys and blacks blend into the road in low vis conditions as well as absorb heat in the summer.  I'm all about the blue and red cars for visibility. While I don't expect someone to surprise me with a new car, anyone who's sat in a car with me for any length of time has probably heard me rant about these things.", "Ok but there are differences here. Black cars get hotter when sitting in the sun, white cars show every speck of dirt. There's actual pros and cons here.", "You need to get out more often, then. Lots of people wear gold. Silver doesn't look good on everyone.", "Taste in jewellery, sure, but willingness to prioritise your significant other's wants when choosing a gift for them?  With something as important as an engagement ring?  That's right up there.  His reaction is much worse than the fact he got it wrong.", "Same.", "You can\u2019t say preferences change when no where has OPs preference changed, OP also pointed out they wear exclusively silver colored jewelry so is not like she doesn\u2019t wear any\n\nBut as someone who also doesn\u2019t wear jewelry often, my husband made sure to get me something Id actually like because he actually cared about my opinion on the ring. He wanted to make sure I liked the ring that is on my hand for the rest of my life", "I mean, if you're spending hundreds of dollars on a present for someone for them to wear and have on display for the rest of their life, the least you should do is make sure it's something they would like. And if you realize that you actually have no idea, even asking basic questions would be appropriate. If you are still looking for a surprise or whatever, even just \"my (insert whoever, mom, sister, buddy's gf, cousin, grandmother, etc) was talking about how much they love their gold halo engagement ring and that everyone would love exactly that, is that true? I've never thought about it.\" Then partner can be like \"yeah, honestly that's the best.\" Or \"no, personally I wouldn't want that even though it's a great ring, because I only west silver and don't like the style of just 1 big stone.\"", "So you never look at your partner then\n\nThat\u2019s what that tells me", "Sorry but there\u2019s literally no good reason to buy your partner a ring you know is not their taste, unless you were so thoughtless you never bothered to consider if it would be their taste.\n\nShe did communicate, she said it wasn\u2019t her style and he kept pressing, so she snapped and said it was gaudy. She probably snapped because she realised her fianc\u00e9 was a thoughtless arsehole, which is fair enough", "Exactly this.", "He didn\u2019t have to spend money on the stones. Yes that is cheap, especially since he didn\u2019t bother to use one\u2019s she\u2019d actually like.", "Seriously, if she was happy with the proposal but not the ring, she should have brought it up. \"Hey, I'm excited to marry you, but this ring is a little impractical/nor my style. Can we figure out something else for the wedding band/ring?\" \n\nIf you can't discuss that like adults, maybe marriage is not on the table. Avoiding it and then snapping and insulting it is immature. AKA not ready for marriage.", "Exactly! Why not just be honest in the first place. OP could have gently gotten the point across.", "She told him it wasn't her style the first time he asked and he kept pushing the issue.", "At this point I think no matter how she said it he would be butt hurt, angry and sad. Someone that doesn\u2019t put any effort into something so important like this but thinks he does isn\u2019t really open for honest communication. He thinks : oh I designed the ring only for you but you are not happy with it and I don\u2019t know why, blahblahblah", "Imagine spending 5 months of your salary on a ring and not caring if it's something the recipient would like or not.", "No he didn\u2019t. The diamonds are family heirlooms", "Speaking as a man, a lot of men simply don't know that precious metal colour matters to a lady. They see gold as an \"upgrade\" over silver, and would _never_ get silver... as it's too cheap and nontraditional for an engagement ring, which are presumed to need to be expensive.\n\nI got my wife a silver engagement and wedding ring without diamonds that she wears every day through everything - but I don't _notice_ she only wore silver jewellery, it had to be discussed.", "Yep.  I'm not a little boy, but I knew when I bought a poster for my son that he'd want the minecraft one.  Just like I knew my daughter would want the mermaid one.  Getting the style wrong I can sort of understand, but getting the metal wrong, and not taking her profession into account is really weird.  He shouldn't be angry with her, only himself.", "He didn't ask her about the color, fully agreed. Even having to ask seems kind of dumb.\n\nIt's not a lemon as much as a new car in a style she doesn't like.", "Sure, but not thinking to do that, and just going ahead and excitedly choosing out a ring you think she will love does not make you an asshole or inconsiderate, nor does it indicate you aren\u2019t focusing on the important things because you didn\u2019t realize she hates gold. The people insisting that his missing the mark on the ring make him an ass or claiming that it indicates he\u2019s not paying attention have a very narrow and limited view of what counts as paying attention. Op could have communicated kindly, there\u2019s no excuse for snapping and calling it gaudy rather than asking to change it.", "I mean I think we\u2019ve established that we interpret things very differently so I\u2019m not surprised.", "Ok but jewelry is only about style and looks - so in getting her a gaudy ring, he absolutely did zero research about a big financial decision, because it fails to meet its only requirement - to look good to the wearer. Like, cars get you from point A to point B, so even if they're hideous, they still do that. He didn't care enough to look into what she would like to wear for (hopefully) *the rest of her life*. And then got offended when she had an opinion on something she was meant to wear every single day even though he didn't do any actual thinking on what she would like.", "Yes you think the piece of jewelry someone of expected to wear the rest of their life doesn\u2019t rank in the \u201ctop 500\u201d of things their would be spouse should care about\n\nLike if you\u2019re expecting someone to wear something for literally the rest of their life you better make sure THEY LIKE IT", "Not really. I think not noticing jewelry doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t notice things that have more bearing on a relationship, emotional cues, sensitivities, ways of thinking and viewing the world. I also think that if someone gets a gift and they don\u2019t like it, they can express themselves in a way that is kind, not coming from a sense of having been aggrieved by the unsatisfactory gift. I imagine we have very different marriages.", "Yea I\u2019m in one where we make sure the things we get the other are things they actually like and appreciate and not random shots in the dark\n\nLike my husband isn\u2019t a fan of jewelry either. He is a fan of military history. His wedding ring has metal from a WWII tank and wood from a rifle stock because I pay attention to my husband and his interests"]}
