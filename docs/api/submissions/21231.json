Gotta let people figure it out themselves, and pushing someone to hold to something they previously thought they wanted is just\u2026 well, unkind, to say the least. \n\nAnxiety is no joke; attorneys and would-be attorneys deal with a plethora of it, not to mention depression. I can\u2019t imagine how much worse it must be for doctors. To brush that and attempts to keep it lower it aside is just plain uncalled-for.

If that becomes her career, you should be proud. \n\n3) For a person to choose a career without considering overall quality of life is just foolish.\n\n4) Speaking as a person who is treated by doctors, I don't want a doctor who--for whatever reason--doesn't want to be a doctor.", "When I was 12 I wanted to be a \"pop star\", children don't know what they truly want and it's likely even her \"dream\" of being a doctor was just regurgitated from things adults around her told her and valued.", "YTA because of your lack of tact.

It can still work out.", "I'll go ESH. Your initial comments I thought were fine, but when you dragged mental health into it, which prob wasn't wise, though I see it was her parents that mentioned it first. But it obviously did make everybody self conscious. However I also think the parents overreacted (if they didn't want mental health to become a topic, they shouldn't have brought it up).\n\nAlso, as you say, you don't see them as much now, so are prob not fully aware of what things are like in the family, how they now feel about things, etc.", "NTA, assuming it was a one off situation and you didn't go badgering her constantly. You might have been Y T A if you're a stranger as it wouldn't have been any of your business, but you obviously aren't.\n\nIf such a small bit of verbal pushback can upset them that much I wonder how bad it'll get in the real world.\n\nMaybe this hits a little close to home for me, but I was in almost the exact situation when I was 17 and was talked out of it by my parents. They didn't force me into anything, but simply talked me out of it. Many many years later, I'm happy they did. If your convictions can't stand up to simple verbal pushback, then perhaps you should question your convictions and not get angry at the person who gave you the pushback?", "NTA.\n\nThese anxiety diagnoses are going to be the death of productive human beings.\n\nI teach acting, and I can tell you it's one of those jobs that people go into to avoid the stress of other jobs. But then, surprise, surprise, it is stressful. All these youths who have been coddled into the dirt don't know how to handle that the whole world is stressful, and everyone has anxiety from time to time.\n\nDoes she want to be a gardener? Okay, so that either means a large scale landscaper which is difficult laborious work, a botanists, a job my aunt does and is extremely competitive, low paying and difficult, or she wants to work in a garden center where she'll have to deal with customers.\n\nYou might be the only voice of reason in her life.
