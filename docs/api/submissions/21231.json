Gotta let people figure it out themselves, and pushing someone to hold to something they previously thought they wanted is just\u2026 well, unkind, to say the least. \n\nAnxiety is no joke; attorneys and would-be attorneys deal with a plethora of it, not to mention depression.

Your initial comments I thought were fine, but when you dragged mental health into it, which prob wasn't wise, though I see it was her parents that mentioned it first. But it obviously did make everybody self conscious. However I also think the parents overreacted (if they didn't want mental health to become a topic, they shouldn't have brought it up).\n\nAlso, as you say, you don't see them as much now, so are prob not fully aware of what things are like in the family, how they now feel about things, etc.", "NTA, assuming it was a one off situation and you didn't go badgering her constantly. You might have been Y T A if you're a stranger as it wouldn't have been any of your business, but you obviously aren't.\n\nIf such a small bit of verbal pushback can upset them that much I wonder how bad it'll get in the real world.\n\nMaybe this hits a little close to home for me, but I was in almost the exact situation when I was 17 and was talked out of it by my parents. They didn't force me into anything, but simply talked me out of it. Many many years later, I'm happy they did. If your convictions can't stand up to simple verbal pushback, then perhaps you should question your convictions and not get angry at the person who gave you the pushback?", "NTA.\n\nThese anxiety diagnoses are going to be the death of productive human beings.\n\nI teach acting, and I can tell you it's one of those jobs that people go into to avoid the stress of other jobs.

All these youths who have been coddled into the dirt don't know how to handle that the whole world is stressful, and everyone has anxiety from time to time.\n\nDoes she want to be a gardener? Okay, so that either means a large scale landscaper which is difficult laborious work, a botanists, a job my aunt does and is extremely competitive, low paying and difficult, or she wants to work in a garden center where she'll have to deal with customers.\n\nYou might be the only voice of reason in her life.

And I have one pair that was from a grippy sox vacation.", "Land arch is a pretty stressful time, at least academically. But hey, beats cadaver rummaging, I guess?", "Around which country?", "Long term rehab hospitals. Like traumatic injury, heart transplant, stroke, etc. Used to volunteer at those rehab hospitals and was given beige grippy socks they were about to throw out. \nStill new, but either the packaging labels got ripped or damaged, they can\u2019t give those to patients anymore. Great for yoga.", "I've had about six surgeries since 2012. My wife has had one. Each time, one of the first things they had us do when changing into the gown for surgery was put on grippy sox. And we got extra pairs sent home with us.", "I grew up in NJ, where you can\u2019t pump your own gas. I always saw the attendants with tons of cash. I wanted to be a gas station attendant.\n\nI guess I still can.", "In kindergarten my bestie wanted to be a teenage mutant ninja turtle when he grew up. I guess he needs to try harder to live his dream.", "Right? I wanted to be a doctor because I was smart and it made a lot of money. \n\nThen I got older and figured out I didn\u2019t want to do anything a doc does and there were other avenues.", "She is his business, he's her godfather.\n\nWTF!?", "I think it\u2019s a good question to ask kids. It gives you good insight into what they are into at the moment and means absolutely nothing for the future because they simply are kids. You can see how they change through the years and it\u2019s wonderful. All I ever wanted to be when I grew up was my mom or an athlete. By the time I was in high school is was kind of a joke because none of that would ever work for me and I went to college for something that i was adamantly against being even though it was a typical job a lot of kids wanted to be", "Man, I've really let 6 year old me down by not becoming an astronaut.", "Both my dad and my grandmother chose to be cadavers as their last career. I know my father went to a med school and I believe my grandmother did too. If it\u2019s any consolation please know that having students use my dads body as a tool to learn was one of the greatest gifts he could have give us to help our grief. \n\nIt was a light in the absolute darkness in those first hours, days, weeks, and years. It gave some kind of purpose to our loss. We knew that even after death he still had teaching to do, he still had an impact to make. And not only an impact directly on the students but also an impact on anyone they go on to help. That his one act of donating his body had the potential to impact hundreds of lives. \n\nI don\u2019t say this to try to minimize the trauma of human cadaver dissection. No matter how logical anyone is, it\u2019s fucking hard. I just wanted to let you know what it\u2019s like to be on the other side. I am so grateful to people like you for giving my dads death some kind of meaning and purpose. Thank you so much.\n\n\nAlso yes, what you said. OP is TA", "Hey now that\u2019s what I wanted too!!!", "That's at the weekend :)", "If you figure it out, let me know, I'm still working on mine too!", "That holds no weight in the real world. It's a symbolic gesture  that has origins in the catholic Church and its teaching. It doesn't give you carte Blanche to stick your nose in to tell your godchild how to live/study. \n\nOffering guidance is one thing, being a pushy jerk is another. He needs to mind his own business and focus on raising his own children.", "For a solid year in elementary school I told everyone I was going to be a pilotfirefighterliontamer. Now I\u2019m a speechlanguagepathologistbusinessowner and love my career SO MUCH. Go figure.", "That\u2019s such a good point.", "I've always found gardening really helped me with my anxiety,  mental health overall. I worked in Healthcare for years and it's true, you see a LOT of shit. Bad shit. YTA. Good thing her own parents at least have her back.", "Faramir: \"The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee, where gardeners are held in high honor.\"\n\nNothing less noble about being a gardener. Some are even heroes!", "Also we need more ecological gardeners out there, there are plenty of customers that are willing to invest in ecologically sound gardens. Plus plus plants are very interesting!", "And even though job choice doesn't cure mental illness, environment can have a profound impact on how it manifests. Super fast-paced environments with lots of high stressors can definitely make anxiety worse.", "Gardening and caring for plants is the only thing that\u2019s kept me sober from h3roin for so long, (almost 3 years now \ud83d\ude42) it can be INCREDIBLY calming and meditative, and actually helps me self-regulate and keep up with important habits like eating regularly and taking all of my meds. It can also be incredibly lucrative, and is a fascinatingly complex, yet low-stress world to dive headfirst into. I also used to want to be a doctor, but now I think med school would just destroy me if I even tried, though I have deep, deep respect for those who do choose it as a career path!! This girl learned enough about herself before leaving high school to KNOW that med school wouldn\u2019t be right for her anymore, and I think that\u2019s really respectable too. There\u2019s nothing wrong with changing your dreams as you get to know yourself better.", "Also, there are a crazy amount of \"gardening adjacent\" agriculture and botanical studies if she's serious about it academically.\n\nOff the top of my head: \n\nLandscape architect\n\nMaster gardener (usually run public parks)\n\nAgricultural sciences - so many specialties\n\nBotany - the folks who create better/newer plants\n\nBiology (there are many fields in biology from microbiology to oceanography to plants and animals)\n\nThere are scientists that track invasive species and make studies to limit their impact - great chance to spend a lot of time outdoors and with similar minded folks.\n\nOP, You need to expand your thinking. And you were unkind as well!", "I design gardens for children who have PTSD.  Gardening CAN actually help heal", "This is the part that\u2019s insane to me. I went to college with a lot of previously high-achieving students, many of which initially wanted to become doctors. Quite a few switched out of pre-med & a not insignificant number dropped out altogether after a couple of years. Unless their tuition was fully covered by scholarships, they\u2019re still paying off their loans. \u201cEncouraging\u201d someone to *spend thousands of dollars* on something they\u2019re not fully committed to pursuing is just terrible advice.", "That\u2019s assuming they\u2019re in the US or Canada. It\u2019s not as difficult in other countries and they go straight to med school after high school.", "ew no. creepo OP doesnt need to spend one on one time with this girl.", "Are you also going to dictate what profession they should do?", "Imagine the profits you could have realized after you taught the lions to fly the plane.", "There were SO many very smart and hardworking people with anxiety disorders in my horticulture program! It can be a great field of work- there is definitely pressure sometimes, and horrible bosses, but it\u2019s still absolutely the best thing I\u2019ve come across so far :) and it\u2019s almost always hiring lol", "Exactly! Everyone is taking \"gardening\" at face value, even though OP even said he didn't remember what she said, just \"something to do with horticulture.\" There are so many different avenues that can take, many of which are not \"being a gardener.\" And even if she does literally want to be the person who tends other people's yards, that still sounds like a nice job that a lot of people enjoy doing.", "The world needs more Sams.", "I agree and love your last sentence!  My best wishes to you in your sobriety.", "Shit, im around that age personally and I know my planned career of choice has changed more times than I can count. She seems like she has a good idea on her path and OP really should trust her judgement on it.", "The amount of entitlement he has for a 17 year old\u2019s life choices is honestly fucking creepy.", "Yeah for real.

I'll have to check it out.", "What about me?? I wanted to be a mermaid when I grew up.", "Yeah it's hilarious to ask a little kid what they want to be when they grow up because you never know what kind of answer you'll get.
