Unless she was counting on bullying you with your ex as entertainment. I mean why else be so angry you don't want to be there. \n\nAnd sorry, when your \"friend\" dates your abusive ex and then says it's none of your business, she is not your friend.", "NTA, it's an invitation not a summons.  You don't have to go to a party you don't want to go to, especially if it is going to cause you trauma.", "NTA. She chose the relationship with your ex over your friendship, and is mad that she can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA.\n\nAn invitation doesn't mean you have to go. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA \nYou shouldn\u2019t have to put yourself in an uncomfortable/ potentially unsafe environment just because it\u2019s a party for your friend.\n\nYour friend should understand that the relationship ended in bad terms and you are not comfortable being in the same room as him for an extended period of time.", "Your not-really-a-friend broke girl code and wanted not to feel bad about doing so by inviting you to her party. She wants to believe she's a nice person and did nothing wrong, and rudely demanded you just \"get over\" her dating your ex because your hurt feelings are inconvenient to her self-perception. \n\nYou were honest and told her you wouldn't be comfortable facing your ex, which a real friend would understand and accept. Your declining the invitation reminds her she hurt you by her choice to date your ex, and she doesn't like thinking she's in the wrong. Her solution is to make out that YOU'RE the asshole here. The audacity. \n\nYou're NTA, and this person is nor your friend. I would challenge those opinionated people judging you for staying away re how easily THEY would've \"just sucked it up\" and faced similar themselves. Everyone's brave who isn't facing the music themselves SMH.", "NTA, it is perfectly acceptable for you to decline an invitation where the very real possiblity exists that your mental health would be effected by the presence of someone who abused you. And an actual friend would never have set you up to walk into such a situation totally unaware of this persons presence. So please stop thinking of this person as such she was not and is not your friend. Her over reaction to your statement of not going to her party screams she was looking forward to drama being created by forcing you to come face to face with this man. Anyone saying that you should have sucked it up is also an asshole in my book, it is up to you and only you to decide when or if you are ever in the presence of someone who abused you.", "NTA", "NTA, that is NOT your friend she chose a relationship with your ex over you, and whoever is tell you to suck it up are idiots. You had to attend therapy to deal with the aftermath of that relationship, no party is worth bringing all that up. \n\nWhy support her when she didn't support you. Dating someone's ex is already a weird thing in my book, but like if it was a short relationship. ended on good terms, and noone feelings are hurt, I guess sure, but dating the ex of a friend when that ex cheated on your friend, made her feel like crap, and she had to see a therapist is absolutely bonkers. \n\nAll this for a party too? Please parties arent mandatory. What really stands out to me, if you hadn't discovered on your own that they had a thing and confronted her, would she have even told you? You would have shown up at this party completed unprepared to find out not only was your ex there, but he was dating your friend. \n\nThe fact that she alsonwas hiding it shows she was never really your friend. Don't engage, don't reach out, and don't look back! I don't know why you even sent her the gift after all that betrayal. This friendship is over.", "She\u2019s not your friend. You\u2019ll be better without her. Don\u2019t give pieces of yourself to people who don\u2019t deserve it.", "Hate to break it to you, but she ain't no friend of yours.", "Your FAMILY said you should have gone?! Wtf NTA at all.", "NTA.. this is not your friend", "Let it go you should have not gone to the party due to the emotional damage that your ex-boyfriend caused to you.

Expecting her to exclude him from her party is unreasonable.", "Where does it say that OP expected the ex to be excluded from the party?", "First of all,  I'm glad you're out of the abusive relationship. Your instincts to stay away from your ex, are serving you well.  \n\nI think you need to take a long hard look at your friendship,  however.\n\nWhy on earth would a \"friend\" date another friend's abusive ex? \nMy guess, is that she either:\n\nSomehow believed that you deserved it ( HELL no)\n\nBelieves that he'll treat her better..( superiority trip, combined with magical thinking)\n\nOR\n\nShe doesn't believe it even happened. \nWhich is essentially the same as calling you a liar.\n\nNone of these possible scenarios display anything resembling friendship. Friendship can't exist without mutual respect and regard.\n\nYou might be questioning yourself right now, as that's an aftereffect of emotional abuse and gaslighting. It can happen to anyone with prolonged exposure to that kind of mistreatment.  It will get better as your healing progresses. \nAnd your healing will progress faster the sooner you cut ties with anyone who isn't on Team You.\n\nBest wishes,  and NTA, absolutely.", "NTA. She sounds abusive , she yelled and was trying to force into a situation that would cause you to be emotionally fragile. Block her, she\u2019s no friend.", "NTA. A friend would understand that being in an environment with an ex, regardless of good or bad break up, can be challenging. She shouldn\u2019t have pushed the issue and her dating the guy if she knew how you were treated shows she doesn\u2019t value you as much as she does him.", "Wow some of your friends and family are also A\u2019s", "She made her choice, let her be. Depending on how much you really value the friendship, I would set boundaries but let her know you\u2019re there for her. Chances are high that your ex will be a repeat offender and she\u2019s going to see for herself in the future. NTA", "NTA she is not your friend. Period. Cut her out of your life.", "NTA. She was no longer your friend once she decided to start dating someone who abused you. Block her and move on.", "You have some sort of significant issues with your ex, who she is currently dating. It's reasonable for you to say \"I can't be around him\". The consequence of this is that you won't be around her either, 'cause they're dating.\n\nYou not being there doesn't ruin the party. I have no idea why she's being so dramatic about this. Lots of people don't go to parties, and the world does not end.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If she were a true friend, she would have told you that she's sorry you'll miss the party but she understands.", "NTA. She knows how you were treated and the therapy you had because of him. What actual friend would 1) date your abuser 2) expect you to attend a party where he is present. SHE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. please drop her and enjoy your life.", "Why should you have sucked it up?\n\nNTA but this is not your friend.", "NTA but your friend definitely is. If you are not ready to be in that situation nobody can force you. I had a similar experiance with a birthday party and dealing with my ex sat there talking about sleeping with other people casually since sent me straight back to therapy.", "NTA. Never contact them again. Those that are giving you trouble go LC or NC, too. They are not your friends.", "She's not your friend!, so don't go. A friend would not date your ex full stop.

How does not attending a party make you  jerk?\n\nI find it sad and awful that your Ex and she got together.  Does she know how he hurt you? \n\nYou even mailed her a gift and she returned it.  The friendship is over, for at lest as long as she is with the EX.\n\nMaybe I am just paranoid, but I wonder if there was some sort of humiliation of you planned by her and Ex.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Odds are he's going to cheat on her too and then she'll get back in touch with you. Don't buy into it. She has no morals nor scruples.", "NTA. Don\u2019t be sad. Your friendship has run its course."]}
