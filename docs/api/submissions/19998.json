And an actual friend would never have set you up to walk into such a situation totally unaware of this persons presence. So please stop thinking of this person as such she was not and is not your friend. Her over reaction to your statement of not going to her party screams she was looking forward to drama being created by forcing you to come face to face with this man. Anyone saying that you should have sucked it up is also an asshole in my book, it is up to you and only you to decide when or if you are ever in the presence of someone who abused you.", "NTA", "NTA, that is NOT your friend she chose a relationship with your ex over you, and whoever is tell you to suck it up are idiots. You had to attend therapy to deal with the aftermath of that relationship, no party is worth bringing all that up. \n\nWhy support her when she didn't support you. Dating someone's ex is already a weird thing in my book, but like if it was a short relationship. ended on good terms, and noone feelings are hurt, I guess sure, but dating the ex of a friend when that ex cheated on your friend, made her feel like crap, and she had to see a therapist is absolutely bonkers. \n\nAll this for a party too? Please parties arent mandatory. What really stands out to me, if you hadn't discovered on your own that they had a thing and confronted her, would she have even told you? You would have shown up at this party completed unprepared to find out not only was your ex there, but he was dating your friend. \n\nThe fact that she alsonwas hiding it shows she was never really your friend. Don't engage, don't reach out, and don't look back! I don't know why you even sent her the gift after all that betrayal. This friendship is over.", "She\u2019s not your friend.
