On a more serious note, who does she think she is to go around and make your pregnancy public?

For one, she can't be mad at you for \"tricking her\" - you did nothing of the sort. You made a joke of which the people MEANT TO SEE IT knew what it was referring to, she snooped and interpreted information which was not freely given to her, and then PUBLICLY SHARED information which wouldn't have been hers to share in the first place even if it was what she thought it was.    \nI know this isn't ACTUALLY relevant necessarily, but i feel like this is important to help put into perspective what she was doing. The big issue i have here, at least personally (beside her ludicrous reaction), isn't that she shared false, unverified information, though that's frustrating and annoying as hell. It's what she (thought she) actually shared.    \nIt's shocking how many people don't seem to understand things like not announcing pregnancies right away, or at least not to a bunch of people until later, especially people who are/are trying to be mothers. I don't understand how someone who's been pregnant wouldn't think of this. Maybe it's not as common as it seems to me, or not as openly talked about usually. But i have unfortunately seen it multiple times among my family and friends.    \nSomebody gets excited and announces very early. It gets around, people ask how your pregnancy is going, including people you didn't directly tell.    \nAnd then you have to tell people there's not going to be a baby. You might let it be known publicly immediately, but there will be stragglers. You will still have some people ask how the pregnancy is going, or when the baby shower is, and you have to repeat that answer. Again, and again.    \nMaybe off topic or a stretch but it's just... that's the part that really pisses me off about all of this. I might sound dramatic to some, considering the actual matter at hand is a dog adoption. I just don't take lightly to violations of privacy like this.\n\nLighter note: good luck with the Akita puppy! They can be such wonderful dogs, but certainly not for everyone. I'm glad this one's going to be put in better hands.    (edited for formatting error)", "NTA oh I love this so much. What a narcissist she is.

Please hold a gender reveal party and invite your MIL.", "Be very careful when you do get pregnant, this woman has the potential to stomp boundaries and spout your business to the world. I'd keep her out of the loop and in the dark on that when the time comes.", "She owes you an apology on FB that it was her that made a mistake.", "She only has herself to blame for assuming things and broadcasting them.", "NTA 1000%. She made a fool of herself and none of this is on you.", "This is totally unhinged. She chose to publicly broadcast information about you", "Happy cake day", "Right? The list of those that could have known would have been tiny since future grandma had not even been notified, yet... and who better to know that than ol' blabbermouth future dog grandma. Yet, she couldn't stop her lips from flapping the moment she thought she found out.\n\n\n\n\nIt must really hurt to have to take something like that back when you're chasing clout. Maybe it might be worse if someone announced they were getting married before they actually proposed, and then they get turned down... but probably not because you aren't announcing SOMEONE ELSE'S fucking BABY when everyone knows baby announcements are a super touchy subject. NTA\n\n\nNot Grandma sucks.", "Very weird that she didn't ring to *congratulate* them before posting anything online tbh", "Your MIL has got to be fuckin kidding.", " I hope you and your pup share many great memories.", " if you really were pregnant you could tell and not tell who you like.", "And obviously you don't \"owe\" her a grandbaby, and she needs to butt off trying to convince you to get pregnant.", "\"Potential \"?!

And if one wants to be really petty, add something about getting MIL checked for brain injures and/or dementia.", "Yeah, it could've been the case that OP had trouble conceiving, finally had early pregnancy and confided in the closest ones, and MIL starting blasting that shit online. Horrid. \n\nDoesn't suprise me that she isn't part of the groupchat.", "I've read surprisingly many posts on Reddit about parents (in law) announcing pregnancies, genders and births on social media before the new parents get a chance. I am so relieved none of my parents/stepparents/parents in law are on any kind of social media.", "NTA. Not only did she misinterpret a conversation she shouldn\u2019t have even been privy to"]}
