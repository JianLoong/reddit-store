I'm sorry this person is a part of your life. If you end up having kids she is going to be a nightmare. I can see it now. She will always know what's best. She will defy your rules if she is watching the kid. She will criticize your parenting. \n\nAlso, you don't owe her anything.", "NTA 1000%. She did so many things wrong. First off, she\u2019s not even on the conversation. Secondly, even if you were pregnant, she put it on Facebook without even talking about it?! Jfc. That\u2019s not her information to share. And third, ok boomer, \u201caddition\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean baby. I am so sorry you have to deal with that.", "Congratulations! You now know that MIL cannot at all be trusted with any sensitive information for if/when you do get pregnant since she will plaster it all over social media immediately, all for the low low price of a text message she wasn't even supposed to see.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Not only did she misinterpret a conversation she shouldn\u2019t have even been privy to, she actually publicity announced your \u201cpregnancy\u201d without asking you or confirming it or getting permission? Oh hell no. This is 100% on her. Of course she\u2019s embarrassed- what a horrible thing to do!", "NTA - It's pretty widely known that the parents make the first pregnancy announcement so MIL was already an AH for trying to steal your thunder, now she's mad because her actions have consequences (although being embarrassed is a pretty minor consequence) maybe she'll think twice about posting if/when you do have children.\n\nPs. Congrats on your new addition! I hope you and your pup share many great memories.", "She could have rang you to confirm exactly what you meant before she posted anything publicly but no she assumed and went a mile.\n\nShe's just embarrassed and blaming you because that's easier than admitting she leapt to an assumption.\n\nNta", "NTA. You \"owe\" it to her to make her mistake - that she publicized to everyone without permission - the truth after all? Hahahahaha", "NTA. And tell her back the eff off with that talk of you \"owing\" her a grandkid.", "NTA, she\u2019s just embarrassed that she has to deal with the fact that she misunderstood when she was snooping and then blasted that info all over looking dumb. She\u2019s doesn\u2019t not like that because it\u2019s all about her. Congrats on the puppy!", "NTA you weren't even texting her.", "She embarrassed herself. You don't owe her anything...especially a human being. But she owes you an apology. If you HAD been pregnant, how dare she announce it to the world.\n\nNTA. And congratulations on the new family member.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't trick her, she tricked *herself*.  \n\nYou're not responsible for information that MIL misconstrued, in an email that wasn't addressed to her.\n\nShe embarrassed herself and she wants you to pay for it.", "I\u2019ve heard this story before.
