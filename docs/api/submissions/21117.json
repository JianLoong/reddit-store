For one, she can't be mad at you for \"tricking her\" - you did nothing of the sort. You made a joke of which the people MEANT TO SEE IT knew what it was referring to, she snooped and interpreted information which was not freely given to her, and then PUBLICLY SHARED information which wouldn't have been hers to share in the first place even if it was what she thought it was.    \nI know this isn't ACTUALLY relevant necessarily, but i feel like this is important to help put into perspective what she was doing. The big issue i have here, at least personally (beside her ludicrous reaction), isn't that she shared false, unverified information, though that's frustrating and annoying as hell. It's what she (thought she) actually shared.    \nIt's shocking how many people don't seem to understand things like not announcing pregnancies right away, or at least not to a bunch of people until later, especially people who are/are trying to be mothers. I don't understand how someone who's been pregnant wouldn't think of this. Maybe it's not as common as it seems to me, or not as openly talked about usually. But i have unfortunately seen it multiple times among my family and friends.    \nSomebody gets excited and announces very early. It gets around, people ask how your pregnancy is going, including people you didn't directly tell.    \nAnd then you have to tell people there's not going to be a baby. You might let it be known publicly immediately, but there will be stragglers. You will still have some people ask how the pregnancy is going, or when the baby shower is, and you have to repeat that answer. Again, and again.    \nMaybe off topic or a stretch but it's just... that's the part that really pisses me off about all of this. I might sound dramatic to some, considering the actual matter at hand is a dog adoption. I just don't take lightly to violations of privacy like this.\n\nLighter note: good luck with the Akita puppy! They can be such wonderful dogs, but certainly not for everyone. I'm glad this one's going to be put in better hands.    (edited for formatting error)", "NTA oh I love this so much.

So there is no room for. \"You never told me, or I didn't understand\"  she went and not only disrespected a private conversation, but was happy to post, private personal information to the world, so she could get tye attention and look at me feeling.

(Update: This is changing.  There are some accounts only 5 days old and some a year old. But having no other comments is the dead giveaway.)\n\n- account made multiple comments in different subreddits/threads within seconds of each other\n\n- post looks like it used a thesaurus and doesn't quite make sense (because it's a rewording bot using a thesaurus! ). Pronouns are often switched and fancy words that don't quite seem to belong are used\n\n- post is nothing but quoted text\n\n- post begins or ends in the middle of a sentence (often ending with a comma instead of a period)\n\n- a bot NEVER has flair (because it never posts top level comments and certainly never has the top top comment) \n\n- The best and last step is to search within the current thread and find the original that was stolen from.  Unless it's a rewording bot or one of the weird ones that copies from a whole other thread or just posts affirmations (eg I agree! ) you'll find it and know you're right.", "u/Availablriting457 is a bot."]}
