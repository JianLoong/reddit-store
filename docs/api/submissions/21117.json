On a more serious note, who does she think she is to go around and make your pregnancy public?

For one, she can't be mad at you for \"tricking her\" - you did nothing of the sort. You made a joke of which the people MEANT TO SEE IT knew what it was referring to, she snooped and interpreted information which was not freely given to her, and then PUBLICLY SHARED information which wouldn't have been hers to share in the first place even if it was what she thought it was.    \nI know this isn't ACTUALLY relevant necessarily, but i feel like this is important to help put into perspective what she was doing. The big issue i have here, at least personally (beside her ludicrous reaction), isn't that she shared false, unverified information, though that's frustrating and annoying as hell. It's what she (thought she) actually shared.    \nIt's shocking how many people don't seem to understand things like not announcing pregnancies right away, or at least not to a bunch of people until later, especially people who are/are trying to be mothers. I don't understand how someone who's been pregnant wouldn't think of this. Maybe it's not as common as it seems to me, or not as openly talked about usually. But i have unfortunately seen it multiple times among my family and friends.    \nSomebody gets excited and announces very early. It gets around, people ask how your pregnancy is going, including people you didn't directly tell.    \nAnd then you have to tell people there's not going to be a baby. You might let it be known publicly immediately, but there will be stragglers. You will still have some people ask how the pregnancy is going, or when the baby shower is, and you have to repeat that answer. Again, and again.    \nMaybe off topic or a stretch but it's just... that's the part that really pisses me off about all of this. I might sound dramatic to some, considering the actual matter at hand is a dog adoption. I just don't take lightly to violations of privacy like this.\n\nLighter note: good luck with the Akita puppy! They can be such wonderful dogs, but certainly not for everyone. I'm glad this one's going to be put in better hands.    (edited for formatting error)", "NTA oh I love this so much. What a narcissist she is.
