I'm sorry this person is a part of your life. If you end up having kids she is going to be a nightmare. I can see it now. She will always know what's best. She will defy your rules if she is watching the kid. She will criticize your parenting. \n\nAlso, you don't owe her anything.", "NTA 1000%. She did so many things wrong. First off, she\u2019s not even on the conversation. Secondly, even if you were pregnant, she put it on Facebook without even talking about it?! Jfc. That\u2019s not her information to share. And third, ok boomer, \u201caddition\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean baby. I am so sorry you have to deal with that.", "Congratulations! You now know that MIL cannot at all be trusted with any sensitive information for if/when you do get pregnant since she will plaster it all over social media immediately, all for the low low price of a text message she wasn't even supposed to see.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Not only did she misinterpret a conversation she shouldn\u2019t have even been privy to, she actually publicity announced your \u201cpregnancy\u201d without asking you or confirming it or getting permission? Oh hell no. This is 100% on her. Of course she\u2019s embarrassed- what a horrible thing to do!", "NTA - It's pretty widely known that the parents make the first pregnancy announcement so MIL was already an AH for trying to steal your thunder, now she's mad because her actions have consequences (although being embarrassed is a pretty minor consequence) maybe she'll think twice about posting if/when you do have children.\n\nPs. Congrats on your new addition! I hope you and your pup share many great memories.", "She could have rang you to confirm exactly what you meant before she posted anything publicly but no she assumed and went a mile.\n\nShe's just embarrassed and blaming you because that's easier than admitting she leapt to an assumption.\n\nNta", "NTA.

And tell her back the eff off with that talk of you \"owing\" her a grandkid.", "NTA, she\u2019s just embarrassed that she has to deal with the fact that she misunderstood when she was snooping and then blasted that info all over looking dumb.

And congratulations on the new family member.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't trick her, she tricked *herself*.  \n\nYou're not responsible for information that MIL misconstrued, in an email that wasn't addressed to her.\n\nShe embarrassed herself and she wants you to pay for it.", "I\u2019ve heard this story before.

She owes you an apology on  FB that it was her that made a mistake.", "NTA and seeing how your MIL is announcing something that is NOT her business to announce in any way, especially publicly, is a pretty huge red flag. Be very careful when you do get pregnant, this woman has the potential to stomp boundaries and spout your business to the world. I'd keep her out of the loop and in the dark on that when the time comes.", "Definitely NTA but your MIL sure is! Congratulations on the pending new arrival. Mother in law may be very embarrassed but she only has herself to blame for assuming things and broadcasting them. Since she's so keen to be a grandparent remember when she visits when speaking to your dog to refer to your MIL as being the dogs grandma \ud83e\udd23", "NTA- and now you know how she\u2019s going to act when you do get pregnant. She\u2019ll post your joy on FB before you get a chance to tell anyone yourself.

Hope they find a home in you two, and you two spend every day with a smile with them! :DD", "NTA by a lot!\n\nI can't believe how much her comment made me laugh. \"You 'owe' her a pregnancy because she's embarrassed now!?!?!\"\n\nOmg thank you for this", "NTA your MIL had absolutely no right to announce your pregnancy, real or doogo.", "So telling the internet was more important to her than speaking to her son about his happy news? \n\nThis is totally unhinged. She chose to publicly broadcast information about you, before she even spoke to you or your husband. That\u2019s crazy behaviour. \n\nNTA but she\u2019s frightening", "So she took information that she wasn't a part of, interpreted it wrong, didn't check, didn't wait for clarification and just told everyone something that would have been incredibly private (ruining any announcement you would have made yourself) - she embarrassed herself and has to be mad at someone because she doesn't seem able to do things the right way (which is to apologise and learn from it). NTA", "NTA for the last line only.\nSome parents are really unhinged about beeing grandparents...", "NTA. You should have a baby if you're ready and want one, not to save MILs reputation lol", "NTA. MIL needs to butt out. She made a fool of herself and none of this is on you.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nCongrats on also getting that new addition to your family. Nothing better than having that sweet \"fur-baby\" in your life. It's nice to hear that you are adopting a surrendered dog; some don't realize how demanding some pets can really be.\n\nYou didn't trick or fool your MIL, she decided to try to \"ruin your moment\" by spilling the beans on FB.", "NTA You should have left her Facebook post up and put a picturebof the dog underneath it saying \"Congrats Grandma!\". Like another commenter said, you now know she can't be trusted with any private information so she needs to be the last to know everything from now on.", "NTA", "NTA 100%, and she may think someone saying they\u2019re \u201cadding to their household\u201d means a baby, but not everyone. Hell, when my sister-in-law was pregnant with her first, she used the phrase \u201cour family is growing!\u201d and my first question was \u201cdog, cat, or baby?\u201d", "NTA. The whole situation is kind of hilarious. MIL is nuts for expecting you to get pregnant so she can save face. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA-- if you ever do get pregnant, don't tell her till after you announce as she obviously won't keep it secret. Also don't tell her what name you pick or the gender unless you want everyone to learn those from her.", "NTA but both your mother and MIL are. \n\nMIL shouldn\u2019t be putting her nose in someone else\u2019s conversation and should not expect everyone to use the phrase you did in the same way. People can use it to mean pet if they want to. She also shouldn\u2019t put it on social media without your permission. \n\nYour mother should not fly off the handle for \u201cnot being told\u201d. She doesn\u2019t seem to understand that if you really were pregnant you could tell and not tell who you like. Including her. She doesn\u2019t have a right to know.", "absolutely NTA- if i ever know of something through someone else (in this case a group chat) the LAST thing i would do is to broadcast it. Because I simply came to know through somebody else, I did not have direct knowledge from the people involved and, by not being directly involved, i\u2019m reading things that may cause misunderstanding. Jumping to conclusions is one of the things that messes up relationship. \n\nEnjoy the new addition- He/she must be so cute\ud83e\udd70", "NTA. She snooped and misunderstood something the actual intended recipients understood completely. She made a fool of herself. If you'd deliberately tricked her into thinking she was about to be grandmother, sure, she could feel peeved. In this case, she just totally fucked up and rightly feels stupid.", "\"She won't listen to reason and is trying to convince me to get pregnant because I owe it to her.\"\n\nLmao. I have heard some ridiculous things in this sub but this is way up there.\n\nWtf!\n\nObviously NTA. And thanks for the laughs (about your MIL)", "NTA.  Sorry, but i couldn't stop laughing at your mil. She deserves the humiliation for her actions. Who snoops then posts things on Facebook without actually asking the people concerned? An entitled mil i guess. At least you know this woman can't be trusted. Enjoy your secret chuckles at her expense.", "NTA. From the outside, this is hilarious. On a more serious note, who does she think she is to go around and make your pregnancy public? When you do actually get pregnant, make sure you and your husband are in agreement that she should probably be among the last people to find out. You know, so people close to you don't find out about it from 3rd parties.", "This is totally unhinged. She chose to publicly broadcast information about you", "Haha imagine the gall, the audacity of someone telling you to get pregnant beacause they think you owe it to them in their delusional minds since they let everyone around them know you're pregnant without even confirming the news. \n\nAlso imagine if OP were really pregnant and MIL decided to post that news before she could share her happy news, how disrespectful it is.\n\nMIL will obviously be a nightmare to deal with. She sounds unhinged. NTA OP. Stay away from her.", " That\u2019s crazy behaviour.", "Without checking to see if it was ok--I mean, she didn't know if you had announced it officially, so that even if you were pregnant, she'd have stolen your thunder.\n\nETA: NTA"]}
