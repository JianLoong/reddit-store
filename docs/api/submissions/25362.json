She would throw things in with little thought and suddenly they're spending >$500 in a single trip, and going to another grocery store the following day spending $100. \n\nDuring the winter, the heat is constantly set around 80. Doors are left open, windows cracked, fans on. Average heat bill during the winter was $600-$900.\n\nWe had a water line leak. Suddenly the bill was 3x what is usually was... Except it wasn't suddenly. MIL was notified a year ago about the leak and said nothing. \n\nThe other day the MIL took her card to McDonald's and spent $30. \n\nThe final straw is she grabbed my wife's bank card to \"get a few things\". She spent $300 buying things like $35 lunch bags. $20 phone cords. $90 headphones.\n\nI've always considered \"my\" money my wife's also. But now, since her mother apparently thinks it's also her money, I informed the wife I will be opening an account with only my name on it and my checks will be going there from now on. She's more than welcome to use our money freely, however she will need to let me know so I can send it to her. \n\nETA - I discussed this with the wife beforehand. She'll say something to her mother and she will go out of her way to make my wife's life hell, and after awhile just go right back to the same behavior \n\nETA2 - Wife in no way has to justify what she wants or \"ask\" for money. She can always reach me, no matter what. All she has to do is tell me how much she wants and she will get it. She also has a couple of credit cards \n\nTL;DR - MIL has been helping herself to wife and I's joint bank account.

You should not have to be out in a position of treating your spouse like a toddler about money.  This is not your wife being \"in the middle\", this is your wife not being a doormat to her mother.  Maybe she needs therapy?", "NTA. MIL has a serious spending problem. It's very rude that she's treating your money like it's hers too. Doesn't she have SSA benefits/pension since retiring? If she was my MIL I'd tell her she has to make ends meet with just her funds. I'd also lay ground rules about the utility usage; no more setting the heat to 80 in the winter, and if there's a water leak she has to notify us immediately and pay for part of the repair, whatever she can afford. I'll bet that since she moved in, everyone's gained some weight too because she cooks a lot and buys junk food. Put a complete stop to her behavior now.", "NTA for restriction on your MIL access to money.  YTA, if you don't talk to your wife about the problem.  Communicate, don't just make unilateral decisions.", "NTA - What in the world did your wife say to all of this?", "NTA put your MIL in a home, it'll save you money in the long run.\n\nOr, better yet, buy a camper her her to live in and then drive it to a state park and leave her there.", "NTA - She is abusing your hospitality.\n\nYour wife is enabling her.\n\nI doubt this measure will be enough to stop her.", "NTA. Discuss closure of the account and maintain seperate bank accounts.", "I never thought I'd EVER support this, or the idea of a man giving his SAHW an \"allowance\" or the equivalent (not that you're suggesting that, I understand that you're still actually giving her free access to the money, just with an added step . . . I'm just saying that even if you were, at this point I might understand it), but in this situation I have to say . . .\n\nNTA. At all.\n\nIt seems that this has been an ongoing conversation, and you've tried multiple ways to address the problem, and your wife has simply refused to get on board. You're hemorrhaging money, and at this point it's not just your MIL's fault, your wife is VERY MUCH enabling her. For example, on those $500 grocery trips, she should have been taking those extras out of the cart as fast as her mother was putting them in (or simply telling her no before they made it into the cart); or just telling her mother ahead of time, \"I'm sorry, I can't bring you grocery shopping with me anymore. You're costing us hundreds of dollars extra every trip, and we cannot afford it. If there are a few specific things you want me to add to the shopping list, please let me know and I'll do that.\" \n\nI get that her mother makes her life miserable over this, and I sympathise with her, for real. But the reality is that her mother is actively causing problems in your marriage AND with the household finances. So yes, your wife can choose to continue to avoid arguments with her mother . . . but the result is that you're going to end up broke and with your marriage in ruins. Or she can learn to stand up to her mother, and maybe save your marriage and the financial situation - which literally supports her mother as well, AND lets her be a SAHM. And until she is willing to do that, it seems like the only way to prevent financial ruin is to limit access to the money. It's not financial abuse, it's avoiding bankrupting your family.", "NTA, sounds like you've been pretty patient and generous. But I'd probably give them a monthly allowance for them to spend as they please. You're heading towards accusations of being controlling and financially abusive when you decline a random $500 shopping spree.", "NTA. But WOW. Does your wife have no backbone at all?\n\nAlso, you need a better solution than this OP. All you're going to end up doing is having your MIL badger your wife into telling you to send money so she can, again, take the card.\n\nThe solution should be, MIL **not allowed to use the card anymore**. Tell MIL can't willy nilly add things to the cart when shopping together, the items will be removed if they aren't necessary. Doesn't seem hard unless your wife is scared of her mom.\n\nINFO: Does MIL bring in any income for herself?", "NTA for needing a change but you do need to work with your wife on a solution. Does your wife have no power to tell her mother no or to prevent her from buying things with your/wife's money? Sounds like the answer is to kick MIL to the curb. If for some reason these are non-starters it seems you are left with no option but to do what you've proposed.", "NTA \n\nYou proposed an acceptable compromise.

She said she was worried about saying anything and being put in the middle but your response has also done that. It's not a *minor inconvenience* for her to come cap in hand to you for what she needs. You have unilaterally withdrawn her autonomy - of course you don't understand why that matters because you have *all* the autonomy you could possibly want. Will you transfer any money the wife requests? (Urgh, it's so wrong that that's even a question!) What if you think what she's asking for is unnecessary?

Setting boundaries is never comfortable, but your wife needs to set boundaries with her mother or she will continue to cross y'all's boundaries. Her mother spending money is causing drama. Her inability to tell her mother no is causing drama and stress in your relationship. This may be a good temporary solution, but doesn't sound like a long term fix. Can you at least put a cushion in your joint account in case she needs money and can't get ahold of you? The intention isn't financial abuse, but it feels very financially abusive for her to have to ask you for money.", "I think I would threaten MIL with the old folks home.", "Google nest can lock and requires a password to change the temp.

The wife is ACTIVELY contributing to the issue instead of fixing it.", "But your wife will have no access to money without your consent? It\u2019s a bit controlling in my opinion. I would definitely feel uncomfortable with it. Have you not tried speaking with the MIL? Or just telling your wife to not allow her to touch the bank card? It comes across from what you wrote that the only way you have tried to deal with this is by just cutting your wife off from having free access to a bank account", "Your wife not having access to money without you is definitely a problem. \n\nYou would be better off having set spending limits for both of you for whatever reasons and then a budget for household items and needs that your wife also has access to. So three accounts, your account, her account and a household account. And then adding to that that if your MIL uses anything other than your wife's individual card (yours or the joint) then she is doing so without authorization and you will consider it theft. Be firm on that. \n\nBut your wife does need to have independent access to the accounts. She should not have to wait for you to make a transfer.", "*slow clap*", "How is that going to stop MIL? Your wife is the one who has to say no to her mother and until she does how do you know your MIL's random purchases aren't included in the $x. I don't think you are TA for trying to restrict your MIL's spending, I just think you are going the wrong way about it.", "Do you just not understand it is how wrong it is that she even has to request any money from you? \n\nCan you promise hand on heart that you will *never* question her spending? Maybe not now, but in future if you're in a terse mood or something? What about if she's being sketchy (like she's trying to buy you a gift but doesn't want to tell you what it's for)? And if she's going shopping for example, idk for clothes for your children or even herself, how could she possibly know in advance how much she would need. Will you always be available to transfer exactly when she needs it, even in an emergency? \n\nActually, the fact that she even now needs to prepare in advance what she might need to spend is a ridiculous ask compared to the freedom she would have had when she could get anything - clothes, food, medication, sanitary towels, something in an emergency without needing to come back to you. \n\nYou need to try and find a solution that stops your MIL without taking the autonomy from your wife or inconveniencing her to the extreme. You wouldn't ever understand just what you're doing to her because you are in control. And if she can't stand up to your mum, I sincerely doubt that she feels any ability to stand up to you either. I feel dreadfully sorry for her", "She has a couple of credit cards totalling about $1000 also. Unless I'm seriously injured, there really aren't any situations she wouldn't be able to get ahold of me.\n\nYeah I definitely don't want her to feel like it's financial abuse. It's her money too.", "I added an edit. This isn't the first step, it's about the fifth.\n\nNot so much consent as a heads up. If she says she wants money I'm not going to tell her no, I'll just transfer it to her", "I already consider it theft and unauthorized use of the card, but filing a complaint against MIL would likely break the marriage.\n\nThree accounts would be the same thing, wouldn't it? Would still have to send money to her since her mother can't be trusted to have access to anything", "Well, we've been together for 13 years and I haven't questioned her spending before more than \"is this charge legit?\" when it looks funny, so I'm pretty confident I'm not going to suddenly start doing it now.\n\nI'm not sure how I could perceive it as sketchy if I don't even ask what it's for.\n\nConsidering I'm always a text or call away she doesn't even need to plan. Oh the total is $1000? \"give me $1000\" OK - send-\n\nShe also has 2 credit cards in case of emergency, and always has.", "Sorry I\u2019m still so confused how this is the solution/that this is the situation? Why is the MIL with you, neither of you seem to even like her!", "The main difference would be you distributing the money at payday with a previously agreed upon amount for her individually and for the household versus her having to ask and wait for you to transfer every time she wants a coffee or needs to grab an ingredient for dinner. And the household account would be the main account. Your account would have the same spending limit as your wife's and of course, a savings account. \n\nLike I said, the reporting your MIL needs to be a form boundary and it is quite possible it is going to be the end of your marriage if your wife has zero access to money independently as well so choose your poison.", "You just don't get it despite \"autonomy\" being very clearly explained to you. YTA", "She will be unable to afford to live without me. For whatever reason the wife feels obligated to keep supporting her even through all of this nonsense", "Have you fully read OP\u2019s position and actions? Having the wife request money makes her think twice who wants it\u2026 her or MIL. Coupled with conversations about the situation between OP/wife, this seems like like the best current option. Kicking MIL out would be a disaster, and pushing the wife to change also sounds like a disaster In waiting. Setting stringent boundaries without hampering the wife (she has credit cards if she doesn\u2019t want to ask, and OP doesn\u2019t care about wife\u2019s spending) sounds like a win.  Oh yeah, to add, normal people carry some cash around with them for small purchases etc.", "No, I don't get how having 2 credit cards she's free to use at any time without even asking me or being able to tell me to give her however much she wants is not autonomy, you're right.\n\nI feel like somewhere along the way you've gotten the impression she has no access to any ways to buy anything. Apologies if I've not explained well enough other ways she can purchase things without me having to transfer money to her first.", "I think you two need to sit down and have a big convo about this", "So why does she have to call you for money a money transfer then? And how is that going to stop the MIL from using it the cards she has? You're right, you haven't explained it well at all.", "Better to spend cash/debit than use credit cards?\n\nHer mother can be told the credit cards are maxed out, just like \"we're broke\" with the bank cards.\n\nIt's bad enough with the \"real\" money the MIL knows my payday, and like clockwork suggests going shopping the day I'm at work after payday since she knows if I'm off, I'll take the wife to the store"]}
