You should not have to be out in a position of treating your spouse like a toddler about money.  This is not your wife being \"in the middle\", this is your wife not being a doormat to her mother.  Maybe she needs therapy?", "NTA. MIL has a serious spending problem. It's very rude that she's treating your money like it's hers too. Doesn't she have SSA benefits/pension since retiring? If she was my MIL I'd tell her she has to make ends meet with just her funds. I'd also lay ground rules about the utility usage; no more setting the heat to 80 in the winter, and if there's a water leak she has to notify us immediately and pay for part of the repair, whatever she can afford. I'll bet that since she moved in, everyone's gained some weight too because she cooks a lot and buys junk food. Put a complete stop to her behavior now.", "NTA for restriction on your MIL access to money.  YTA, if you don't talk to your wife about the problem.  Communicate, don't just make unilateral decisions.", "NTA - What in the world did your wife say to all of this?", "NTA put your MIL in a home, it'll save you money in the long run.\n\nOr, better yet, buy a camper her her to live in and then drive it to a state park and leave her there.", "NTA - She is abusing your hospitality.\n\nYour wife is enabling her.\n\nI doubt this measure will be enough to stop her.", "NTA. Discuss closure of the account and maintain seperate bank accounts.", "I never thought I'd EVER support this, or the idea of a man giving his SAHW an \"allowance\" or the equivalent (not that you're suggesting that, I understand that you're still actually giving her free access to the money, just with an added step . . . I'm just saying that even if you were, at this point I might understand it), but in this situation I have to say . . .\n\nNTA. At all.\n\nIt seems that this has been an ongoing conversation, and you've tried multiple ways to address the problem, and your wife has simply refused to get on board. You're hemorrhaging money, and at this point it's not just your MIL's fault, your wife is VERY MUCH enabling her. For example, on those $500 grocery trips, she should have been taking those extras out of the cart as fast as her mother was putting them in (or simply telling her no before they made it into the cart); or just telling her mother ahead of time, \"I'm sorry, I can't bring you grocery shopping with me anymore. You're costing us hundreds of dollars extra every trip, and we cannot afford it. If there are a few specific things you want me to add to the shopping list, please let me know and I'll do that.\" \n\nI get that her mother makes her life miserable over this, and I sympathise with her, for real. But the reality is that her mother is actively causing problems in your marriage AND with the household finances. So yes, your wife can choose to continue to avoid arguments with her mother . . . but the result is that you're going to end up broke and with your marriage in ruins. Or she can learn to stand up to her mother, and maybe save your marriage and the financial situation - which literally supports her mother as well, AND lets her be a SAHM. And until she is willing to do that, it seems like the only way to prevent financial ruin is to limit access to the money. It's not financial abuse, it's avoiding bankrupting your family.", "NTA, sounds like you've been pretty patient and generous.

You're heading towards accusations of being controlling and financially abusive when you decline a random $500 shopping spree.", "NTA. But WOW. Does your wife have no backbone at all?\n\nAlso, you need a better solution than this OP. All you're going to end up doing is having your MIL badger your wife into telling you to send money so she can, again, take the card.\n\nThe solution should be, MIL **not allowed to use the card anymore**. Tell MIL can't willy nilly add things to the cart when shopping together, the items will be removed if they aren't necessary. Doesn't seem hard unless your wife is scared of her mom.\n\nINFO: Does MIL bring in any income for herself?", "NTA for needing a change but you do need to work with your wife on a solution. Does your wife have no power to tell her mother no or to prevent her from buying things with your/wife's money? Sounds like the answer is to kick MIL to the curb. If for some reason these are non-starters it seems you are left with no option but to do what you've proposed.", "NTA \n\nYou proposed an acceptable compromise.

So three accounts, your account, her account and a household account. And then adding to that that if your MIL uses anything other than your wife's individual card (yours or the joint) then she is doing so without authorization and you will consider it theft.

Maybe not now, but in future if you're in a terse mood or something? What about if she's being sketchy (like she's trying to buy you a gift but doesn't want to tell you what it's for)? And if she's going shopping for example, idk for clothes for your children or even herself, how could she possibly know in advance how much she would need. Will you always be available to transfer exactly when she needs it, even in an emergency? \n\nActually, the fact that she even now needs to prepare in advance what she might need to spend is a ridiculous ask compared to the freedom she would have had when she could get anything - clothes, food, medication, sanitary towels, something in an emergency without needing to come back to you. \n\nYou need to try and find a solution that stops your MIL without taking the autonomy from your wife or inconveniencing her to the extreme.

And the household account would be the main account. Your account would have the same spending limit as your wife's and of course, a savings account. \n\nLike I said, the reporting your MIL needs to be a form boundary and it is quite possible it is going to be the end of your marriage if your wife has zero access to money independently as well so choose your poison.", "You just don't get it despite \"autonomy\" being very clearly explained to you.
