Maybe she needs therapy?", "NTA. MIL has a serious spending problem. It's very rude that she's treating your money like it's hers too. Doesn't she have SSA benefits/pension since retiring? If she was my MIL I'd tell her she has to make ends meet with just her funds. I'd also lay ground rules about the utility usage; no more setting the heat to 80 in the winter, and if there's a water leak she has to notify us immediately and pay for part of the repair, whatever she can afford. I'll bet that since she moved in, everyone's gained some weight too because she cooks a lot and buys junk food.

Communicate, don't just make unilateral decisions.", "NTA - What in the world did your wife say to all of this?", "NTA put your MIL in a home, it'll save you money in the long run.\n\nOr, better yet, buy a camper her her to live in and then drive it to a state park and leave her there.", "NTA - She is abusing your hospitality.\n\nYour wife is enabling her.\n\nI doubt this measure will be enough to stop her.", "NTA. Discuss closure of the account and maintain seperate bank accounts.", "I never thought I'd EVER support this, or the idea of a man giving his SAHW an \"allowance\" or the equivalent (not that you're suggesting that, I understand that you're still actually giving her free access to the money, just with an added step . . .

At all.\n\nIt seems that this has been an ongoing conversation, and you've tried multiple ways to address the problem, and your wife has simply refused to get on board. You're hemorrhaging money, and at this point it's not just your MIL's fault, your wife is VERY MUCH enabling her. For example, on those $500 grocery trips, she should have been taking those extras out of the cart as fast as her mother was putting them in (or simply telling her no before they made it into the cart); or just telling her mother ahead of time, \"I'm sorry, I can't bring you grocery shopping with me anymore. You're costing us hundreds of dollars extra every trip, and we cannot afford it. If there are a few specific things you want me to add to the shopping list, please let me know and I'll do that.\" \n\nI get that her mother makes her life miserable over this, and I sympathise with her, for real. But the reality is that her mother is actively causing problems in your marriage AND with the household finances. So yes, your wife can choose to continue to avoid arguments with her mother . . . but the result is that you're going to end up broke and with your marriage in ruins. Or she can learn to stand up to her mother, and maybe save your marriage and the financial situation - which literally supports her mother as well, AND lets her be a SAHM. And until she is willing to do that, it seems like the only way to prevent financial ruin is to limit access to the money. It's not financial abuse, it's avoiding bankrupting your family.", "NTA, sounds like you've been pretty patient and generous.

All you're going to end up doing is having your MIL badger your wife into telling you to send money so she can, again, take the card.\n\nThe solution should be, MIL **not allowed to use the card anymore**. Tell MIL can't willy nilly add things to the cart when shopping together, the items will be removed if they aren't necessary.

Does your wife have no power to tell her mother no or to prevent her from buying things with your/wife's money? Sounds like the answer is to kick MIL to the curb.

Will you always be available to transfer exactly when she needs it, even in an emergency? \n\nActually, the fact that she even now needs to prepare in advance what she might need to spend is a ridiculous ask compared to the freedom she would have had when she could get anything - clothes, food, medication, sanitary towels, something in an emergency without needing to come back to you. \n\nYou need to try and find a solution that stops your MIL without taking the autonomy from your wife or inconveniencing her to the extreme.

She's basically stealing from you. Confront her yourself, tell her she is No Longer allowed to spend Your money. You will not tolerate her bullying Your wife for access to Your Money. If she doesn't start respecting you and your house, she needs to leave. Put your foot down. Your wife needs to grow a spine, therapy would do her a world of good.\nYour wife won't divorce you for placing boundaries unless her mother pushes her to do it, so She will have access to the money after the divorce", "OP, it's time to have a serious sit down with both of them.\nSince you are the only one supporting them , mil needs to disclose her finances. \n\nNo ifs and / or buts.\n\nYour wife has no spine when it involves her mother. \n\nMil needs to work a part-time job if she needs extras.\n\nYour wife needs to realize YOU COME BEFORE HER MOTHER!\n\nIf your wife has no spine, give her a set amount weekly and stick to it.\n\nWhat is with the leak, and why was ur mil the only one aware of it?\n\nIt sounds like you love ur wife and want her happy.\n\nBut at the same token, does ur wife feel the same?\n\nThat would be my first question. \n\nA marriage is two people and not with a leeching mil", "NTA.

You say your MIL has taken your wife\u2019s card before to go shopping- what is to stop your MIL from taking your wife\u2019s credit cards to still go shopping? What is to stop the MIL from still being abusive towards your wife, just because the money is not there- except now it would be \u201cwhy don\u2019t you have money?

Including boundaries/reacts for how your MIL reacts towards your wife? Why does MIL *have* to stay with you? I know she is retired but if she is going to mistreat your wife, why do you allow your wife to be treated like that (yes, I know it\u2019s her mom/family, but still) within y\u2019all\u2019s own home (hence the boundaries you create together)?\n\nI guess my info is- how do you see this being a long term solution to the problem when you\u2019re not fully addressing the issue (the way your MIL treats your wife)?", "What does your salary have to do with your MIL's retirement? Those two things should be separate. She should be the one financing her retirement. Is she sick, infirm, taking care of the children? No? Then she doesn't need to live with you.\n\nShe is bleeding you dry with unnecessary spenditures. She shouldn't even be able to access your (you and your wife's) money. You need to save for retirement and your children's future, not to fund MIL's whims.\n\nA trip to a financial planner is in order. You might need seperate accounts for a while, one main one controlled by you for housing expenses and the day to day running of your life. Your wife should not have access to this yet. You each have an account that has a limit each month so when it's gone it's gone. Let your wife have one credit card that she is responsible for paying off each month with no help from you.\n\nBut most importantly, get your wife into therapy so she can set boundaries with her mother. Mother needs to move out and stop using your money. Until your wife puts her foot down and put you and your family first, nothing will change.", "NTA", "NTA but this is a gamble. If you're ever incapacitated, this could leave your wife and kids without money. Hopefully it won't happen but it could. I would move everything to a fresh joint account and sit down with wife and MIL and let her know unauthorized charges will be treated as fraud or theft full stop. Please don't cut your wife and children out entirely. We never expect these things but one medical emergency, car accident etc could leave your family scrambling.", "Not send them, send the wife.", ">you took an adult into your home without proper communication or understanding of money and boundaries.\n\nYou think OP needed to explain that mother-in-law shouldn't steal?

Like who woulda thought?!!", "MIL being booted is the long term solution, but we can't just put her out as much as I want to.\n\nThe MIL thinks the worst of me already.

When she wants to go spend money, wife can go on her own phone and transfer money to her greenlight card, then spend it.

You have a major wife problem and need to get your wife to step up and stop enabling her mother. \n\nWhat you\u2019ve planned isn\u2019t a long term solution.

And what are the long term plans here? Like is OP only concerned about his money or actually having a harmonious home environment? Or does he not care cause he spends so much time working?", "Shady Pines, Ma!!", "Agreed.  My hubs is like this.  While determined avoidance of confrontation with others, actually causes worse conflict in other areas.  NTA.  Your wife needs to contain this and if your MIL makes her life hell, she no longer has the privilege of living with you.  Simple.  Lock down that money and time for a family meeting of house rules and boundaries clarity.  It sucks that she put you in this awkward position but definitely needs to be dealt with, head on.  Good luck!", "It sounds like her mother is a tyrant who won't take no for an answer. I'm sure it's somewhat of a relief to the wife that she now has a good excuse at to why she can't freely give her mom money any more. That's not even what OP said they were doing. She's still going to have access to money, he'll just send it to her instead. That way MIL can't just spend as much as she wants. Your response seems really extreme. Idk how people ever expect to stay in long term relationships if they don't understand the nuance of said relationships", "Maybe wife can get a part time job since kids are pre teens and give her mother spending money", "I believe she gets some retirement. Don't know what she spends it on though", "Yes, sadly is so much easier and less trouble for her to be able say \"we're broke, can't go to the store\" than it is to stand up to her. And then she can show her we're \"broke\"", "She probably saves hers and spends yours. If your wife is open to it (temporarily), encourage her to carry cash. Tell MIL you two have gotten into Dave Ramsey and only spend cash. Sorry, MIL. You can't spend $90 of my $100. You're on your own.", "No. 2 was the first thing I thought of.
