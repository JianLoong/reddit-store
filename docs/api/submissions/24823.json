Of course you want to keep him safe, and dogs can be dangerous, but please don't project your fears into him and make him fearful of dogs when he doesn't have to be. Dogs are everywhere, and many are perfectly friendly.  You just have to teach your son how to behave around them. Don't get in their face. Don't hug or climb on them.

With the right training and such they can be amazing family pets and sweet dogs. Much like any breed good training goes a long way. That being said I live next to two yellow labs that are some of the most aggressive dogs I\u2019ve seen due to lack of training. They bark constantly at anything that moves. They lunge at the fence and jump at whomever is on the other side. They are terrible and a threat. The kicker?
