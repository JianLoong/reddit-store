My father (92M) has been living with us for the past year as his dementia has been getting worse. \r  \n\r  \nOver the past 3 months, my father has been increasingly referring to Leighton as \u201cRussell\u201d. Russell was my father\u2019s brother. I never met Russell, as he and a friend, James, along with James\u2019s parents, died in a car crash in 1956 when Russell and James were 15. My great-grandparents were wealthy enough to have color photos of the family back then. I\u2019ve seen photos of Russell, and I will say Leighton looks like he could be his great uncle\u2019s twin.\r  \n\r  \nMy kids have been asking who Russell is, and I\u2019ve just told them he was my uncle who died young. When they ask for more details, I just tell them I don\u2019t know much about him and that my father/their grandpa was not in a state to talk about him.\r  \n\r  \nMy father never talked about Russell to the grandkids, and when I was a kid, rarely brought him up. About 8 years ago, my father and I were in the bedroom and were talking about gay marriage due to news around it. That\u2019s when he told me he had a secret he wanted to tell me. He told me that when Russell and James were 13, his family had caught the boys acting romantically. After that, Russell was scolded by the family for his homosexuality. He told me the only reason they let the boys remain friends is they didn\u2019t want this information to be public. He told me Russell was always \u201ceffeminate\u201d and how his family would mock him for that. My father admitted he participated in the mocking and how he regretted it later in life. He said Russell would cry over this often, and looking back later in life made him (dad) feel terrible.\r  \n\r  \nLast week, I was at the doctor\u2019s office with Leighton for a minor injury he had from baseball when I got a call from Weston\u2019s teacher that he had been saying some homophobic things in class. She explained he was using the f slur, \u201cgay\u201d as an insult and mocking a boy for being \u201cfruity\u201d. In the car after we left, Leighton told me he\u2019s heard some of the kids in his grade from the robotics club (which Weston is in) use that language. \r  \n\r  \nAfter I picked up Weston from detention, Leighton and I tried talking to him and telling him to stop, he said it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. I had my husband/his dad talk to him, but Weston ignored him too.\r  \n\r  \nI then decided to sit both of the boys down, I got photos of Russell and explained his story. How badly the family treated him, my father telling him the story of how Russell would cry in his bed. \r  \n\r  \nThe boys just sat there, I don\u2019t know how it affected them, but I hope it left an impact. \r  \n\r  \nLater that night, I was talking to my older sister (58F) about this, her kids are in their mid 20s. She told me that I shouldn\u2019t have told them about Russell, or at the very least, waited until dad died and I was not considerate of him. She also said they weren\u2019t old enough and it was too dark of a thing for them to know.

I get it, we have an era of civil rights very unlike those of 1956. But if you were born in that era, you stop learning new tricks after awhile. Everyone becomes cemented at some point in the era they came from. Grandpa's suffering a fatal disease, not in his right mind, and doesn't have too much longer. It's kind of callous to talk about the most embarrassing scandal of someone you don't know, who grandpa knew, whose death and circumstances he deeply regrets, and in fact is reliving in his dementia.\n\nThere's no reforming grandpa or teaching grandpa  lesson. Grandpa's mind is too far gone now to learn anything. All he can really have at this point is comfort. So yes, I see where the sister is coming from.\n\nPicture the most embarrassing thing you know about somebody close right now. Maybe you somehow made fun of or otherwise participated in that.

And those who stand in the background and stay quiet - or judge because they can\u2019t do this themselves - need to know that there is power in the truth and that the right thing to do is the right thing to do and there is no gray area on that, ever. At the end of the day, it is all family - and it is messy and sad and happy and amazing and private but public and they need to know they are connected to all of it - so to open one\u2019s mouth and hurt someone now is to hurt someone who you should know is part of you and you should know that - and life is love, and love is everything.

There is never a time in either of my kids life where they would have ever thought it appropriate to say any words that your son did. And my oldest is an adult. We don\u2019t care if they swear at home, but slurs are absolutely unacceptable and they\u2019ve known this for years. You have 100% dropped the ball on this topic for your children if they felt comfortable saying it in a place where it isn\u2019t even allowed (good on your school for their lack of bigot tolerance).
