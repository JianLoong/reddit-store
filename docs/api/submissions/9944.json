He had 4 glasses of wine by now and after we all finished eating, the server poured everyone another complimentary glass of a new wine. If he drank that 5th glass we would have to stay in the parking lot for a long time so he could sober up and drive (the staff was prepping to close the restaurant). I said very nicely he should drink more water to sober up and a taste would be fine and he said okay and takes a sip. We\u2019re all talking and after a few minutes I slide his glass next to mine and pour the rest of the wine into my glass. He makes a funny joke that it was his wine and I shouldn\u2019t have taken it, everyone laughs. We all get up to walk around the restaurant\u2019s flower garden for a bit and my husband says he\u2019s going to get another glass at the bar to walk around with. We all tell him no, he doesn\u2019t need it bc we\u2019re going to leave after walking around and he says okay. He seemed happy and not bothered by it. We walk around and then go home. Later he says he didn\u2019t like that I took his wine and that it embarrassed him and made him feel like he couldn\u2019t make his own decisions when he\u2019s an adult man. I was confused bc I drank it because I didn\u2019t want to waste wine. I tell him sorry I wasn\u2019t trying to embarrass him and that he had agreed to only have a sip so I didn\u2019t want to waste the rest of the wine. He says he knows he agreed to a sip but I shouldn\u2019t have drank it. I asked what I should have done instead. He said I should have tapped him on the hand to signal he should stop drinking. But even if I tapped his hand I still would have drank his wine so that it wasn\u2019t a waste. I then ask if I hadn\u2019t drank his wine would he have drank the glass even though he said he\u2019d only have a sip and he says yes and I asked if we hadn\u2019t stopped him from buying another glass would he have done it. He says yeah. And I tell him that if he drank more we would not have been able to leave until hours later and he said he didn\u2019t know we were leaving sooner. I thought that was odd he didn\u2019t know because all the other diners had left and the staff was prepping to close. Note, I couldn\u2019t drive and we were far from home so an Uber would be too pricey to take home and come back later to get the car. AITA for what I did? I\u2019m really trying to understand his POV but I don\u2019t understand why he was embarrassed and mad by a situation that wasn\u2019t awkward or a big deal.

We have no clue how long this took.   They went to lunch but the place was preparing to close as they were leaving.   Where I live there are very few if any places that are only open for lunch and not dinner and the ones that are close around 3.   They got up and walked around the flower garden for a bit as well.    We don\u2019t know the man\u2019s size, but we do know he drank with food which slows alcohol effects keeping BAC lower actually.   People are also acting like he was oblivious to what was going on around him as he didn\u2019t realize everyone was leaving in a minute.   We don\u2019t know the area so perhaps he thought they were gonna walk the strip or go somewhere else to hang out afterwards which is also pretty common.\n\nI\u2019d say NTA cuz it\u2019s always better to be safe but I can see his annoyance if he was sober and you were babying him.   Really just depends on if he has a history of lacking restraint and not knowing when too much is too much.   If he\u2019s not had alcohol issues and demonstrated responsible decisions around alcohol then he may be annoyed that you had no reason to publicly doubt his decision making.", ">If he drank that 5th glass we would have to stay in the parking lot for a long time so he could sober up to drive\n\nwhy on earth were you okay with him having more than a glass of wine when he was the driver?? why are you okay with him drinking THIS heavily when going out??", "YTA He was planning on driving after 5 glasses of wine, you were happy to let him drive after 4.

How long were you at lunch?  was it a quick business lunch or were you there for 3 hours enjoying a leisurely afternoon?  What time did you get your first glass?  What time was the last glass glass served?  The general rule of thumb is one 12 oz beer or  one glass of wine per hour.  Restaurant standard pour is about 5 oz of wine.  Also, what did you husband eat?  Did he have just a light lunch (soup/salad) or did he eat something heavier (sandwich/fries or burger).  Was your spouse drinking water with each glass?  Was your spouse showing signs of visible intoxication (loud, orverly boisterous, aggressive/excessively playful behavior)?  All of these factors affect absorbtion rate of alcohol, especially food consumption, time between glasses, and speed of drinking.\n\nAlso, why, if your table had already consumed several rounds, did the server pour another full complimentary glass?

I was going to say ESH because nobody should be driving after 4 glasses of wine at lunch. How long exactly would they have to sit in the parking lot to be safe from a DUI?

If the bartender poured them to the brim (which you\u2019re NOT supposed to do in a restaurant) he\u2019d have drink approximately a whole bottle of wine by himself.

IDK where people get the idea that drinking water sobers you up. Drinking water hydrates you to hopefully prevent a hangover headache. Drinking water can't \"sober you up,\" but if you follow the alcohol edu rules we learned in college (lol) and alternate alcoholic drinks and water and sip it slowly, that will make you less drunk to begin with...clearly too late for that in this case, though!", "> There\u2019s no way he wasn\u2019t well over the legal limit in any country that has a limit on alcohol and driving. \n\nThat is significantly incorrect. We have no way to know his size, the length of time they were there or the ABV of the wine. A 185 pound man can have 2 glasses of wine at 12% and still be legal to drive many places, if we assume standard metabolism works off 1 glass an hour, that's 3 glasses for even a fairly normal sized person. Make the person larger, the wine weaker or the time longer and it's easy for the person to be under the legal limit. \n\nOf course, it's entirely possible that the person is smaller, the wine stronger, etc. But the point isn't about saying he for sure was over the limit, just that it was possible.", "I feel like the only way this would be okay is if they went for lunch and stayed till the place closed in the evening and he had 4 drinks over that whole period of time, but that's definitely not what it sounds like. And if he wasn't noticing the place closing and had to be reminded by her and have his wine taken to stop and then forgot about that and tried to get another glass to wander around with...it doesn't sound like he even APPEARED to be fine to drive.", "Yeah, one glass of wine should be around one additional hour to sober up.

If you cause an accident of any sort and you blow above a zero, you\u2019re getting a DUI. This is such a common misconception. If you blow a 0.08, that just means the cops need literally nothing else to convict you evidence wise. If you cause an accident (read: it was your fault legally) and blow under that, they\u2019re still going to convict you via proving that alcohol impaired your driving ability. Even at a DUI checkpoint where you haven\u2019t caused an accident yet, they may still get you on impaired driving, which is illegal. There really is no legal limit.
