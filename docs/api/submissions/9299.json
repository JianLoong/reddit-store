I told her \"no, I have to do something else\" because I was heading off to meet my friends. She then again told me to buy her stuff, came back and then go meeting with them. I told \"fuck off you can go yourself if you need it that much\". She told me she can't because mom took the car, I told her to walk. She then started insulting me but I left without paying attention. \n\nWhen I came back she has already made up a big drama about how I insulted her and refused to buy her medicine to our parents.

Yes, we can go out of our way to accommodate a bit because we can see they are uncomfortable (to put it mildly), vulnerable, hormonal, etc. That does not mean \"drop everything to be at their beck and call\".\n\nShe asked, you said no. That's reasonable. Everything after that was her being an asshole. I'm sorry to hear your parents bought in to her embellished story and treated you like an asshole as well, they suck for that.\n\nKeep a firm boundary - I'm not saying don't do anything nice for your sister, but do it when you want and how you want (otherwise it's not being nice, is it?).", "NTA. She may actually require all of the help she is asking for. But it doesn\u2019t matter, none of that prevents her from treating you with respect. \n\nYou are not her servant. You do not work for her. You do not owe it to her. If she needs your help she can ask for it politely and with respect for your time and plans, just like anyone else.\n\nThe baby growing inside of her does not force her to make demands or incapable of communicating help needed in advance.", "NTA\nIf she can have a miscarriage if she doesn't get the medicine, why is she not planning ahead? I get being pregnant is pretty hard and you may have to rely on others more than you're used to. It'd also be great to help her out occasionally too.\n\nHowever, it is not your responsibility to buy her medicine, ice cream, and chips whenever she feels like it. She can and should plan ahead, and ask nicely if shes trying to get someone else (who is not responsible for these things) to help. \n\nWhat happens when she runs out of diapers? What happens when she runs out of formula? Not your responsibility. She made choices to end up here. Sounds like you have no other choices in this situation. Feels unfair. I'd ask your parents what your expectations are for you to help with an adult sibling you're not responsible for. Get that convo out of the way now or you're doing to be stuck buying her diapers and wipes whenever she forgets.", "NTA - You are a child. It is not your responsibility to take care of your pregnant sister. If she needed this medication and couldn't get it herself, then she should have asked your parents to get it for her. \n\nYou need to sit down with your parents and have a very serious discussion about what is going to happen when this baby is born. It is great that they want to house and support your sister and her child. But whether you want to help is YOUR choice. If needed, say this to your parents:\n\n\"If I wanted to spend my teenage years taking care of a baby then I would have one of my own.\"", "NTA, but you are screwed until you GTFO, or she takes the baby and leaves.  \n\nIf the medicine was really, really needed right that minute to prevent a miscarriage, then your sister would have been under close medical supervision.  Not necessarily at the hospital, but you would have known, and you would have been told ahead of time if she couldn't be left alone and you were \"it\".  Further, if you are in the US, prescriptions are sent in to your pharmacy electronically.  In my state, that also includes narcotics.  You wouldn't have been given a piece of paper.  And, if she \\*did\\* have a paper prescription, why did she not get it filled on the way home?  And, while I can think of several OTC meds that could cause pregnancy problems, I can't think of any that will prevent them, or solve them - well, maybe Tums and GasX.  But, still.  \n\nI will say that I have had 5 healthy, boring pregnancies, and there were still days that I just ached.  And, yes, the instructions from the OB were to just rest until I felt better.  \n\nAs for her needing drugs and snacks?  Why couldn't she instacart?  Some Walmarts here actually have their own delivery people.", "You don\u2019t have to do her bidding it\u2019s not your job and you shouldn\u2019t have been grounded but you shouldn\u2019t be rude to your sister either. to me you\u2019re NTA and then you also are in the sense you can handle it better. So can she, if she didn\u2019t ask politely that\u2019s not cool either. \n\nIn saying that, one day when you need help and support remember these times. What goes around comes around and I can\u2019t stress that enough", "NTA. I'm sorry, but how is your 18 year old sister NOT having safe sex and getting pregnant your problem? No, you don't have to go run all her errands for her. If your parents are ok with her situation, then they can be the ones to help her. Ho enjoy your childhood with your friends.", "NTA.  If this was just a case of a couple times your sister asking you to do her a favor when she feels really bad, you\u2019d be the asshole for refusing, but if it\u2019s every damn time you turn around, yeah.  She can pound sand.\n\n(The only way my answer changes is if your sister was put on bed rest by a doctor, as some pregnant women are.  A lot of these women are told not to get up for anything besides going to the bathroom.  In that case, her behavior makes perfect sense, and doing anything else could cause her to lose the baby.  But since you didn\u2019t mention that, I presume that\u2019s not the case.)", "Your sister is going to expect you and the others in the household to do much of the baby care, OP.  I hate to say this, and don't know your age, but you need to figure out an exit plan for leaving when you are of age.  \n\nExpect push back from your parents, because when you leave a lot of the child's care will fall on them.\n\nNTA\n\nPS (I would have been tempted to get the meds from the pharmacy, and then to bring her stuff like broccoli and apples from the grocery.  Actually, walking there would probably be really good for her.)", "NTA being pregnant isn't debilitating and waking isn't going to cause any serious issues unless her doctor instructed her to stay in bed.  She was just using her pregnancy as an excuse to be lazy.", ">she said she can have a miscarriage if she doesn't take that medicine which made me feel very guilty\n\nAnd kindly, this is not YOUR problem. She made the choice to keep the baby, knowing that she wouldn't get support from the father of the baby. She needs to start acting like an adult. Onion chips are not a necessity. Medication can be delivered. She wanted to be an adult, she needs to act like one now. It's not on you to care for her or this baby. Don't let your parents and her bully you into taking responsibilities in a situation that doesn't concern you.\n\nNTA at all. Don't cave in now and start doing all the chores she asks from you, or else you'll be stuck with a looooooooot of baby duty later. Put your feet down NOW.", "NTA bc she could have phoned your mother to pick it up since she had the car.", "NTA. Being pregnant doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to act like an asshole. She could have politely asked you, or called your mother to pick it up on her way home.", "You are NTA. She should be planning ahead and if they are concerned about her having a miscarriage at 7 months she should have all the medications she need when she leaves the doctors and should pick it up right away. \n\nI understand that this is staining on your sister, but that doesn't mean other people become your personal servants for everything. Being an adult (like your sister) need to understand things still need to get done. She need to eat and at least clean up some things. She is extremely lucky she has parents that care enough to help her. Not everyone has that help. That being said, helping her every now and again would not hurt you. \n\nYour sister is lightly TA and your parents are TA for grounding you for this.", "NTA. Just the way she asked you was incredibly rude and I wouldn\u2019t have done it for that alone. If you had said, she had politely asked you if you could please pick up this medicine from the drugstore because she needed it, that would maybe be a different situation.", "NTA if her illness is just \"feeling bad\". Being pregnant isn't a disability and if the mother and child are healthy light exercise like a walk to the shop is actually good.\n\nIf she was diagnosed with something where exercise could hurt her out the child then I would say you should have just gotten the stuff while out with your friends, but the OP doesn't mention that she has a real diagnosis and, for me, feeling bad isn't any excuse to never lift a finger just because you're pregnant.", "Maybe if your parents had grounded your sister a little bit more, she wouldn\u2019t find herself in this current predicament.", "NTA. \n\nYou are not her caretaker or parent. Her lack of preparation isn't your emergency. \n\nShe better learn to prepare because babies don't wait for moms to get their sh!t together.", "NTA. You are not employed to her. She and your parents are all AHs. Say no to every single thing she asks you.", "INFO: How far walking is it?", "It\u2019s weird that your parents would ground you for not being your sisters servant. She chose to do this alone and many women do so, she should get used to it. If she\u2019s so disabled she can\u2019t manage she can likely get her items delivered to her.", "Your parents reacted like that because the health of the baby is more important than right or wrong or silly squabbles between siblings.\n\nI would say help your pregnant sister out in general, however she does seem to be taking advantage of the situation.\n\nNTA, however I still think you could have gotten the medicine for the baby's sake.", "That sounds like a partner responsibility. NTA", "Just wait until that baby arrives. You\u2019ll be voluntold to babysit, change diapers, feed, etc. On top of being awoken in the night because of crying. NTA.", "ESH.\n\n1. Your sister sucks for issuing orders. It's fair for her to ask you to go to the store for her. It's not fair for her to tell you to go to the store.\n2. You suck for not understanding that pregnancy can be debilitating. Each pregnancy is different, but the way you describe your sister is certainly within the range of normal.\n3. The whole miscarriage story doesn't make any sense. Was this \"paper\" a prescription that she wanted you to pick up, or the same of some OTC remedy? It seems like if there was an imminent risk of miscarriage, she'd be using more words like then when she asked you to go to the store.", "NTA if she is that worried about having a miscarriage why wouldn\u2019t she let someone else know about what she needed? instacart? order pickup, ask mom to swing by and get it when she can (since she is also so concerned). grounding you is a ridiculous response when you already had plans and she could\u2019ve asked someone else", "NTA.\n\nShe asked you, but you had other plans, and she said nothing about possibly miscarrying if she doesn't get the meds. That doesn't sound like something a drama queen would leave out ... but it does sound like something they'd add later.\n\nWhy didn't she ask your mom to pick them up? She had the car and was already out and about.", "Soft NTA. \n\nYour sister is taking advantage of everyone else, and not helping herself. \n\nUnfortunately,  it's likely to get worse once a baby is on scene. \n\nFrom drama queen to ruthless tyrant in less then 6 months. \n\n\nRemind me! 6 months", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA for suggesting a 7mo pregnant woman walks to the store. I think that\u2019s why your parents could\u2019ve grounded you because it\u2019s extremely heartless. NTA because you have your own life and shouldn\u2019t put things on hold for your sister or your niece/nephew. You\u2019re not the one who is pregnant, time for sister to wake up and face reality because it\u2019s about to get much worse", "I'd have gotten the medicine at least, but if you want to make demands to me, get your own snacks. \n\nWe don't know what medicine she needed, so I have to say ESH.", "ESH! Your sister should have asked nicely, not demanded. You could have compromised, picked up the medication, and brought them back after you saw your friends.\n\nPregnancy is painful. Do yourself a favor and look up what pregnancy actually does to a female's body. It's not pretty.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add; parents suck for grounding you.", "I couldn\u2019t decide.\n\nNTA, What sucks is you\u2019re dealing with the irresponsible behavior of your sister that got her in the position she\u2019s in.  There should have been a plan before this argument occurred.  Your parents should have been on her about that, and it should have been taken care of.  Whether it was to be you to do it or not.\n\nYTA, Ultimately with pregnancy it\u2019s something that can affect the entire family.  Regardless if they are 18 or not.  \n\nBeing in the age group you two are in is the most difficult part of this.  The want for independence is incredible, and makes doing your own thing very important.  Which is why clashes like this occur.  Unfortunately for your sister and your parents who are going to responsible for this child as well now.  There is a tremendous amount of tension, stress, and anguish that comes with this.  Unplanned children often cause people to take of more unplanned responsibilities.\n\nSadly you are stuck in the middle.  \n\nMy real advice\u2026. Take care of yourself, study, go to a reputable/accredited/cheap community college for something in demand, and the gtfo there. Stay sober do well for yourself, and get as far away as possible.  You likely won\u2019t be able to fix anything going on, but you can do what\u2019s needed to get by until you can do want you want.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not OPs responsibility to cater to her sister. She got herself into this situation so she needs to grow up and deal with it. Pregnancy is not an excuse to be a lazy asshole. How is she going to be a good parent when she can\u2019t even take responsibility for herself? No need to coddle her because she\u2019s pregnant. It\u2019s not a disability.", "And how does that make OP an AH?", "Went right over your head didn\u2019t it?", "I also live in the UK so I have no idea the status over there \ud83d\ude05. I saw your comment just after reading some of the OP's comments.", "Is there some reason the reason your mother couldn't have been called to pick up or maybe have the drugstore deliver it?", "10 blocks round trip and the doctor DID say she should rest. Maybe not full bed rest but rest.", "Clearly you didn\u2019t read my \u201cNTA\u201d section. You need to breathe. Goodbye now.", "Because that's how I believe the OP should have handled it. Slightly. The sister is the bigger AH here.", "I don't know, I didn't ask but my mom got her stuff later", "So like a single mile? If she\u2019s tired of walking when she gets there she can call a cab. If she wants to be extra lazy she can even cab there too.  File that under not my problem.", "Why do you feel the OP is obligated to help her sister and delay her own plans?", "Look, I'm not gonna convince you either way so does it really matter?", "It\u2019s a message board, so it doesn\u2019t matter regardless. It\u2019s just a conversation."]}
