Despite this, he's managed to scrounge up livable savings and spend his free time buying sake and not doing his share of chores.

We're almost done paying off the first loan anyway(they were only 20% done with it)) with every excuse possible.

I called a bunch of our mutuals and got a list of those willing to help them get on their feet.
