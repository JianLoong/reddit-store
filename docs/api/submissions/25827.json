My friend has had his share of financial issues and often couch-surfed until I let him stay with me. He promised he would only stay until he got a stable job and 5 years later still hasn't found one. Despite this, he's managed to scrounge up livable savings and spend his free time buying sake and not doing his share of chores.

Neither had much money and had to take out a loan for their wedding but when my wife and I brought this up, once again willing to let them both stay so long as they earned their keep(paying for their food or cleaning up at least), we were dismissed.\r  \n\r  \nAs expected, the \"hard\" moving date was tossed around(Before the wedding: we just need a little more time. The cheapest places are so far away and it would take us off schedule to do so. After the wedding: We are paying off our debts right now and with how important good credit is buying a house, we need to pay off what we have first. Honeymoon after taking out another loan a month later: This is an important trip for us and we should be able to enjoy it. We'll just add this to our pay off soon list. We're almost done paying off the first loan anyway(they were only 20% done with it)) with every excuse possible. Time and time again I asked them if they wanted extra help with finding an apartment or money( we offered to help pay off their debt) only to be dismissed with an air of annoyance.\r  \n\r  \nAfter their announcement of a honeymoon and trying for kids, I realized that they intended to stretch out their stay for as long as I'd let them. I called a bunch of our mutuals and got a list of those willing to help them get on their feet. I sat them down a day into their honeymoon and told them that we can't house 4 people with more on the way on our salary and gave them the list of mutuals. They called us assholes for \"kicking them out of their house\" and \"leaving them with nothing\". They left for their trip and haven't spoken to us since.
