Natalie has an older sister Mica (37f) who works at a \"high end\" restaurant in our home country.\n\nBoth Natalie and Mica wanted to go on a holiday and decided to come and visit my country (I have moved about 8 years ago to the UK). I have agreed to be their tour guide and show them around, but have told them they will have to stay in the hotel as I don't have space in my flat to have 2 guests around for 2 weeks and I didn't know Mica that well either. Natalie had no issues with it and a few days before their arrival (Saturday) has asked me to book a restaurant as both of them wanted to have something nice and the internet connection wasn't great as they were traveling. I have booked a restaurant where a good friend of mine is a chef and it is a family run business where the food is absolutely delicious, it also has many 5 star reviews and a local favourite.\n\nWhen Natalie and Mica have arrived, I gave them time to get ready and took them to the restaurant. Both of them order Caesar Salad as \"Mica tries it everywhere and since she works in a restaurant herself she judges the place by how they make the salad and how correct the recipe is\". My friend personally brings our order and Mica starts throwing a fit and arguing with my friend that the Caesar she has been served is not correct as it doesn't have tomatoes, olives and boiled egg. My friend tries to be polite and asks her if she wants these ingredients as extra toppings, but neither Mica or Natalie are having it and started creating even bigger argument to the point of Mica insulting my friend by calling him a bad chef since he can't make a simple salad correctly. So my friend has asked them to leave his restaurant and never come back.\n\nI have apologied to my friend and left a big tip, I have also explained that I had no idea they will behave this way. After I left, both Natalie and Mica started slagging off my friend and telling me I have chosen the worst place to eat and I should be greatful that Mica has quickly recognised how bad this place is because they didn't serve the salad right, and that I should warn others not to eat there.\n\nAt this point I have had enough and have told them they can visit the places by themselves as I will not be putting up with their entitlement any longer, especially since they keep insulting my friend for serving a classical version of a salad to them and causing a scene. I have also mentioned how embarrassing their behaviour was and that I expect them to apologise to my friend. As they have refused to do so, I have called them a taxi and left them there, returning to my place.

I had flown in early and asked the travel agent I was working with if she could contact the tour operator for a hotel recommendation in the departing city.\n\nThe instructions clearly stated that passengers would be met in the train station at x:30 in the afternoon. Since the hotel they had recommended was quite close to where the barge was docked, they offered to swing by and pick me up at the hotel  before picking up the rest of the passengers at the train station, for which I was very grateful.\n\nBecause of some issues in Paris with the Yellow Vests striking, the cruise was undersubscribed and it was the owner who came to pick me up in his van (instead of a hired driver with a shuttle). On our way to the train station, another passenger called to see why he and his wife hadn't been picked up at the train station yet. They had decided at the last minute to take an earlier train and were irate that they had been waiting over 2 hours (it was still at least a half hour before the stated pick-up time).\n\nBecause of Bluetooth and hands-free technology, I got to listen to his entire profanity-laced diatribe about how they were freezing their a$$es off in the drafty train station and basically throwing his weight around. The weather ***was*** unseasonably cold and windy due to a [Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_%28wind%29), but they were remarkably unprepared clothing-wise (especially for someone who bragged about spending a month in the south of France each year).\n\nI got a sinking feeling in my stomach that the trip would not be nearly as enjoyable as I had been anticipating. And was I ever proved correct. This guy was a wine snob and kept complaining that the wine was inferior (not that you could tell by the amount he was swilling). I felt so bad for our tour director who was doubling as the wine steward listening to that crap everyday. It was really cringeworthy and you could tell that he hadn't previously dealt with someone that rude.\n\nThe couple also bragged about all their luxury travels - if true, then the barge cruise was the equivalent of me staying at a budget hotel.

You should block them from your socials and move on, maybe do something nice for your chef friend as an apology for the one your former guests aren't going to give.\n\nI sympathize with you because when I was in my late teens, I once got stuck at a big group meal with a guy who professed to be a hot shot waiter at a fancy restaurant like Mica from your story. He declared right as we walked in the door that he was going to sit in judgment of the service that night and he made our waiter's life a living hell, then badgered everyone to not leave a tip because our extremely harassed service wasn't up to his \"standards.\" He wasn't really showing any professional \"standards,\" though - he was just an AH. I think you handled it perfectly, better than I could at the time because I was the one visiting then. Still, I gave the waiter all the cash I had in my wallet that night and never spent five minutes in that guy's company again, with absolutely zero regrets. Block them, take yourself to a nice dinner at your friend's restaurant and savor every bite.", "NTA. She was disrespectful and entitled, and she embarrassed you. I wouldn\u2019t want to be around them either.", "NTA. If the menu has what\u2019s in it listed, they should\u2019ve noticed it. \n\nThat being said, every restaurant has their own version of food and they could have eaten around the items they didn\u2019t like or send it back. Instead they were rude and complained loudly for no reason. I would drop this person as a friend because anyone who is rude to a waiter/waitress is not someone I\u2019d wanna be around.", "What do you bet Mica works as a server at a fast casual place.", "Now this has me questioning what tf kind of restaurant that woman works in more than her idea of what a Caesar salad is, because they were personally served by the head chef. Someone not familiar with food service might consider a chef to be one of the \u201cinferiors,\u201d but people who\u2019ve worked in kitchens usually address chefs with deference. This is batshit-crazy behavior for someone who claims to be in \u201chigh end dining.\u201d", "That\u2019s brilliant", "This is me exactly. Fellow olive hater here", "Glad I could give you the (well deserved) upvote that changed the total from my ex-husband's birthday. lol", ">Nicoise is mayonnaise-based \n\nNicoise is not mayonnaise-based *shudder* There\u2019s no mayo anywhere in a classic Ni\u00e7oise", "Exactly! If you're the only cook on the line at Waffle House, I guess you could call yourself Head Chef for your shift, right?  /s", "Olives in a Caesar salad would be too salty. The Caesar dressing is already very salty and so is the cheese that's normally in it. Adding something briny like olives would be overpowering.", "I used to do this with my Papa. He'd pick up his salt shaker, shake it at me, and we'd go have warm tomatoes,  fresh off the vine as a snack, while we walked the garden, picking whatever needed picking at the time. It's one of my favorite memories!", "This. I believe the chef that invented it did so in a California restaurant? Also , I've heard you rub the bowl with garlic, make the dressing in that bowl, then add the ingredients. Also remember hearing it was done table side? I think. I'll have to do some googling.", "I want a tomato sandwich! Only sandwich I eat with white bread for some reason, mayo, salt and big fat tomato slice. So good, I can\u2019t wait for them to be ready here.", "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20190521-the-surprising-truth-about-caesar-salad Found it. It was actually Tijuana. The chef moved from California back to Mexico.", "Right? But try being seemed the picky kid trying to explain that lol", "It's especially fun when the same people who call you picky for not liking tomatoes even though you like ketchup, are the same people who do not like ketchup even though they like tomatoes.  \n\n\nLike WTF why is it 'picky' when I do it but it's 'a preference' when you do it?", "Wait no lettuce? What's in it then?", "Very true, it's always been a vinaigrette in my experience also. There's always been romaine lettuce tho, so I'm not sure what Greek salads you're getting?", "A big part of why I don't like certain shit is down to texture as well, that always seems to classify as picky whereas taste, not so much", "Is your friend\u2019s first language not English? Could this be a translation error?\n\nHer behaviour is nuts either way", "Somehow, I'm guessing OP's hopefully now **former** friends were the types of people who were full of themselves, without any real objective justification for it.\n\nThe people I know who are experts in anything tend to be a lot more humble than people who \"know just enough to be dangerous\" as it were.", "I feel like Mica was getting a Cobb Saland and a Cesar Salad woefully mixed up!!", "Oh haha that\u2019s great! I should start doing that with my ex\u2026", "Isn\u2019t Tikka Masala a dish that was invented by Indian cooks in Great Britain, not a dish from India? That seems like a weird dish to make your litmus test unless it\u2019s your actual favorite.", "The best tikka masala we\u2019ve ever had was sold by an Indian woman out of her family\u2019s gas station. We still miss her food, that was years ago.", "Well, that makes it a good test for British-Indian or (British \u201cIndian\u201d) cuisine. Which seems plausible to be what Brits mean when they say they \u201clike Indian food\u201d, so perhaps quite the relevant test for the GP commenter.", "Yeah. I wonder if she's actually thinking of cobb salad.", "I like adding black olives to Cobb salad. But not green. That would be jarring.", "Ni\u00e7oise was my thought as well.  I could see how the names could be confused, but not likely by someone in the \u201chigh end\u201d restaurant business (quoting OP\u2019s friend).", "Cucumber tastes more like a melon than a pickle.", "Correct, no tomatoes.  According to the Better Homes & Gardens 1981 edition, it's apples, celery, seedless green grapes, Walnuts & raisins.  The dressing is lemon juice, mayonnaise, sugar and whipped cream.", "That's like an un-wedged Wedge salad. \n\nI hope they at least gave you dressing!"]}
