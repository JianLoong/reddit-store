Natalie has an older sister Mica (37f) who works at a \"high end\" restaurant in our home country.\n\nBoth Natalie and Mica wanted to go on a holiday and decided to come and visit my country (I have moved about 8 years ago to the UK). I have agreed to be their tour guide and show them around, but have told them they will have to stay in the hotel as I don't have space in my flat to have 2 guests around for 2 weeks and I didn't know Mica that well either. Natalie had no issues with it and a few days before their arrival (Saturday) has asked me to book a restaurant as both of them wanted to have something nice and the internet connection wasn't great as they were traveling. I have booked a restaurant where a good friend of mine is a chef and it is a family run business where the food is absolutely delicious, it also has many 5 star reviews and a local favourite.\n\nWhen Natalie and Mica have arrived, I gave them time to get ready and took them to the restaurant. Both of them order Caesar Salad as \"Mica tries it everywhere and since she works in a restaurant herself she judges the place by how they make the salad and how correct the recipe is\". My friend personally brings our order and Mica starts throwing a fit and arguing with my friend that the Caesar she has been served is not correct as it doesn't have tomatoes, olives and boiled egg. My friend tries to be polite and asks her if she wants these ingredients as extra toppings, but neither Mica or Natalie are having it and started creating even bigger argument to the point of Mica insulting my friend by calling him a bad chef since he can't make a simple salad correctly. So my friend has asked them to leave his restaurant and never come back.\n\nI have apologied to my friend and left a big tip, I have also explained that I had no idea they will behave this way. After I left, both Natalie and Mica started slagging off my friend and telling me I have chosen the worst place to eat and I should be greatful that Mica has quickly recognised how bad this place is because they didn't serve the salad right, and that I should warn others not to eat there.\n\nAt this point I have had enough and have told them they can visit the places by themselves as I will not be putting up with their entitlement any longer, especially since they keep insulting my friend for serving a classical version of a salad to them and causing a scene. I have also mentioned how embarrassing their behaviour was and that I expect them to apologise to my friend. As they have refused to do so, I have called them a taxi and left them there, returning to my place. However I keep getting angry messages over social media from them and seeing passive aggressive posts calling me an asshole as they now have to spend extra money on guides and transport.\n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1676893769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1174opt/aita_for_refusing_to_host_my_friend_and_her/", "score": 756, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had flown in early and asked the travel agent I was working with if she could contact the tour operator for a hotel recommendation in the departing city.\n\nThe instructions clearly stated that passengers would be met in the train station at x:30 in the afternoon. Since the hotel they had recommended was quite close to where the barge was docked, they offered to swing by and pick me up at the hotel  before picking up the rest of the passengers at the train station, for which I was very grateful.\n\nBecause of some issues in Paris with the Yellow Vests striking, the cruise was undersubscribed and it was the owner who came to pick me up in his van (instead of a hired driver with a shuttle). On our way to the train station, another passenger called to see why he and his wife hadn't been picked up at the train station yet. They had decided at the last minute to take an earlier train and were irate that they had been waiting over 2 hours (it was still at least a half hour before the stated pick-up time).\n\nBecause of Bluetooth and hands-free technology, I got to listen to his entire profanity-laced diatribe about how they were freezing their a$$es off in the drafty train station and basically throwing his weight around. The weather ***was*** unseasonably cold and windy due to a [Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_%28wind%29), but they were remarkably unprepared clothing-wise (especially for someone who bragged about spending a month in the south of France each year).\n\nI got a sinking feeling in my stomach that the trip would not be nearly as enjoyable as I had been anticipating. And was I ever proved correct. This guy was a wine snob and kept complaining that the wine was inferior (not that you could tell by the amount he was swilling). I felt so bad for our tour director who was doubling as the wine steward listening to that crap everyday. It was really cringeworthy and you could tell that he hadn't previously dealt with someone that rude.\n\nThe couple also bragged about all their luxury travels - if true, then the barge cruise was the equivalent of me staying at a budget hotel.
