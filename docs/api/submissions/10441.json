Natalie has an older sister Mica (37f) who works at a \"high end\" restaurant in our home country.\n\nBoth Natalie and Mica wanted to go on a holiday and decided to come and visit my country (I have moved about 8 years ago to the UK). I have agreed to be their tour guide and show them around, but have told them they will have to stay in the hotel as I don't have space in my flat to have 2 guests around for 2 weeks and I didn't know Mica that well either. Natalie had no issues with it and a few days before their arrival (Saturday) has asked me to book a restaurant as both of them wanted to have something nice and the internet connection wasn't great as they were traveling. I have booked a restaurant where a good friend of mine is a chef and it is a family run business where the food is absolutely delicious, it also has many 5 star reviews and a local favourite.\n\nWhen Natalie and Mica have arrived, I gave them time to get ready and took them to the restaurant. Both of them order Caesar Salad as \"Mica tries it everywhere and since she works in a restaurant herself she judges the place by how they make the salad and how correct the recipe is\". My friend personally brings our order and Mica starts throwing a fit and arguing with my friend that the Caesar she has been served is not correct as it doesn't have tomatoes, olives and boiled egg. My friend tries to be polite and asks her if she wants these ingredients as extra toppings, but neither Mica or Natalie are having it and started creating even bigger argument to the point of Mica insulting my friend by calling him a bad chef since he can't make a simple salad correctly. So my friend has asked them to leave his restaurant and never come back.\n\nI have apologied to my friend and left a big tip, I have also explained that I had no idea they will behave this way. After I left, both Natalie and Mica started slagging off my friend and telling me I have chosen the worst place to eat and I should be greatful that Mica has quickly recognised how bad this place is because they didn't serve the salad right, and that I should warn others not to eat there.\n\nAt this point I have had enough and have told them they can visit the places by themselves as I will not be putting up with their entitlement any longer, especially since they keep insulting my friend for serving a classical version of a salad to them and causing a scene. I have also mentioned how embarrassing their behaviour was and that I expect them to apologise to my friend. As they have refused to do so, I have called them a taxi and left them there, returning to my place. However I keep getting angry messages over social media from them and seeing passive aggressive posts calling me an asshole as they now have to spend extra money on guides and transport.\n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1676893769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1174opt/aita_for_refusing_to_host_my_friend_and_her/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think only one had eggs and tomatoes in it.\n\nIn any case, your friends' behavior was appallingly rude.  As in I'm 51 years old **and have never seen such awful behavior in my entire life.** I've been out with friends when something wasn't right.  They were **always** polite in their requests and never made a scene like your friends did.    I'd be profoundly embarrassed if my friends did what your friends did.\n\nThey are 1000% the AHs here.  Honestly, I'd drop them as friends.  How we treat people we consider our social \"inferiors\" speaks volumes about our character.  Think about what that says about them.", "Nope NTA\n\nYou did exactly what I would have done!! \n\nWhat entitled, nasty, rude women they are! If they were Gordon Ramsey throwing a fit, well maybe, but they arent.\n\nAnd they should be grateful you made the reservations for them because otherwise they'd have none (since they had no internet service)\n\nAlso, I have never had a Caesar Salad that had tomatos, Olives and boiled egg in it!! I doubt Mica works at a high end restaurant!", "NTA.\n\nThe level of entitlement on these two is astonishing.", "NTA: at least it happened right away and you can get on with your next two weeks not having to worry about them. Block them on all social media and go about your life.\n\nQuestion: when you say the sister works at a high end restaurant, what is her role there?", "Nta. And in a classic ceasarsallad theres no tomato..and even if it was they are out of line. Ignore them.", "NTA\n\nYikes. The \"high end\" restaurant worker clearly is more a rear end. She thinks she's some kind of salad whisperer?\n\nMany places serve their own take of Caesar's salad or other classic dishes (usually mentioned as such in the menu) and there could be regional preferences (such as adding local ingredient) or it's the classic following the original recipe. That sister probably isn't working with food preparation and have very limited knowledge & understanding in general which (in my experience) tend to lead this type of know-all behaviour. The less you know the more vocal you are... And even that itself isn't the worst, the shitshow behaviour and saladsplaining to the chef was just weird. Sometimes adulting is hard.\n\nThese people are not your friends, you owe them nothing.", "NTA of course, but what the hell is wrong with your so called friend and her sister?", "Most definitely NTA and they get what they deserve. If they hadn't acted so horribly towards your friend you would have been fine being taxi and tour guide as you had originally planned. They are the ones that messed it up.  I'm guessing you're gonna lose this friendship over this and probably that's for the best if this is how they behave.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
