I am a SAHM but my husband has been working as stock trader for the past few years. He works long hours (\\~60 hours per week) so I appreciate that it's not an easy job\n\nEver since my husband started this job, he's been taking meditation breaks. Every time he would come home from work, he would go straight to the study and stay there for 30 minutes by himself. During that time he would nap for 15 minutes and then meditate for 15 minutes before he would come out and start helping out with the kids and the chores. \n\nI always thought it was weird but I didn't make a big deal out of it when our kids were smaller because they would sleep in the afternoons and I had a bit of a break. However, now that they're bigger, they don't want to sleep and they're always running around and need more attention from me so naturally I'm more exhausted now\n\nI told my husband that he can't keep taking these breaks when he comes home because it's exhausting for me to take care of 2 high energy kids all day. He said it's for his \"mental health\" so that he can switch to \"parent mode\" after a high stress day. I told him he's being ridiculous and being a parent is a 24/7 job. This sparked an argument where he said he needed those 30 minutes for himself but I foot down and told him that he can't shirk his responsibilities\n\nThat was 2 months ago and he hasn't been taking these breaks since. However, I've noticed that he's become more irritable and impatient especially towards me. I asked him what's the matter with him and he replied that he's the only one who's expected to make sacrifices for the family. I asked him what that's supposed to mean and he complained about how every Saturday morning I go out for brunch for 2-3 hours with my best friend while he never goes out on weekends and takes care of the kids. I told him that unlike him, I don't socialize with other adults because I'm at home all day but then he said being a parent is a 24/7 job and if he has to give up something that's important to him, then I should too. This sparked another argument which led to nowhere and after that was over he sarcastically said \"my needs are never important anyway\"\n\nOver the past 2-3 days, he's been sleeping on the couch. I don't think I'm the asshole but when I spoke to my sister, she told me I was being inconsiderate.

You take the same time to go out on the weekend on average if it\u2019s 2-3 hours. You are being selfish in wanting him to give up his time, while you keep yours. A half hour to get to have a moment to clear his mind from the work day sounds pretty damn reasonable if he\u2019s working 60 hour weeks. YTA.", "YTA. 30 minutes a day to himself is not an unreasonable ask at all. And if he does that 5 days a week and you take 2-3 hours to yourself once a week, you\u2019re both getting equal time to yourselves. It doesn\u2019t matter that his work is out of the house and yours is in it, you both need and deserve some time off. If you want to do a half hour for yourself in the evenings sometimes too, ask for it. But the solution to this problem should not be \u2018husband literally never gets a moment to himself after working 60 hours a week\u2019.", "Imma go with YTA here. He is asking for 30 mins to decompress from a high pressure job that most likely doesn\u2019t involve mimosas and chatting with his best friend. You have seen how it has changed your husband to neglect his mental health. It has not been good for your relationship. He takes 30 mins to decompress so he is in the headspace to do his part as a father and a parent and a partner. You take 2-3hrs to go decompress with your best friend. It is about balance.", "YTA\n\nHe is working 60 hours a week and taking care of children the rest of the time. All he is requesting is 30 mins for himself everyday. That's something you can give him. It's not hours. It's not neglect. It's a mental health time. \n\nJust the way you need break, he does too. From everything.", "YTA Of course you should get breaks. Yet he needs them too. You want to go out for brunch every weekend and have some time off at the end of the day, he wants to meditate. You need to compromise and find outside help if the both of you can\u2019t manage.", "INFO: when does your husband get breaks or time to go to a bar with friends, etc.?", "YTA. He\u2019s working 60 hours a week and asks for 30 minutes a day to decompress and switch into parent mode and you want to deny him that. I suggest you start getting used to doing it all as a single parent because that\u2019s where you\u2019re heading.", "YTA. His request for 30 lousy minutes to himself when he gets home is more than reasonable. Your hypocritical demands are not.\n\nHis job is to work 60 hours per week and finance the household. Your job is to stay home and care for the children and the home. You BOTH deserve an equal amount of free time.\n\nThis means that your parental and household obligations do not end the instant your husband comes home. At that point, duties become shared, with one covering during the free time of the other. If you get 3 hours completely to yourself every week, so should he.\n\nHe's sleeping on the couch because you have ceased to be a partner and have become an additional obligation. Stop being selfish, think about HIS needs instead of just your own, apologize and talk through the issue.", "Of course he\u2019s more irritable, he needs that, and it only being 30 minutes and he\u2019s happier and a better parent", "YTA\n\nYou get your \"me time,\" he should get his.\n\n 30 minutes to transition from work to home life sounds reasonable, especially since he sounds like he's pulling his weight.", "YTA. Your husband needs an escape/outlet as much as you do, yet you've forced him to give his up while you get to continue with yours. That is completely unfair and it's no wonder why your husband has since grown irritable and resentful. \n\nLetting him take a lousy half hour to clear his head after finishing a stressful work day is by no means unreasonable. You are entirely out of line here.", "YTA can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too. If those 30 min 5x a week is the only time he gets to himself, then that is equal to your weekly 2-3h brunches. Both of you deserve breaks, not just you.", "My thought process took a major turn once I read you go out to brunch with your friend every weekend for 2-3 hours. Yet you still had the nerve to force him to drop his M-F 15 minute nap and 15 minute meditation that\u2019s likely for his mental health? Tell me you don\u2019t care about your partner, without telling me you don\u2019t care about your partner. \n\nNot only are you TA, you\u2019re a selfish one at that.\n\nSigned a mother of two.", "YTA. His breaks totaled roughly the same amount of time that you take for yourself every Saturday. \n\nHis socialization is part of his JOB not fun time like your weekly brunches. \n\nEither give him his 30 minutes daily back or get a job on Saturdays for your socialization time. If he has to socialize through work and gets no breaks, then you need to do the same.", "YTA.  OMG! I thought from the title it was going to be like 3 hours a day or something, but 30 minutes as soon as he gets home so he can unwind, decompress and change modes after a long and probably stressful day at work? You are a selfish AH for not allowing him that time.  That is seriously peanuts in the grand scheme of things.\n\nTHEN to have the absolute AUDACITY to wonder why he is being irritable with you, is just\u2026 WTF.\n\nBUT THEN THERE IS MORE you go to brunch EVERY WEEKENED for 2-3 HOURS and think that is okay but your husbands 30 minutes a night is not? There is something seriously wrong with you.\n\nGrow up.  Don\u2019t be surprised if he leaves you and takes the kids.  Looks like he is doing most of it on his own anyway and I am sure it wouldn\u2019t be a huge burden for him to put the kids in daycare so he can be a single parent.  At least then you can go party it up like it seems you want to.  Gross.", "YTA Taking 30 minutes to transition is not a big ask. When he is done with his 30 minutes than you can also take 30 minutes to chill. But if you do that then he needs to be able to go out with friends on the weekend just like you do. As a SAHM myself the fact that you are being this petty is kind of sickening when you can see how it is negatively impacting him and your relationship when you just want to pitch a silly little fit. \n\nMake compromises or stop going out with your friends on the weekend and see what that does for your mental health and you two can divorce each other in a massive hissy fit. Good grief.\n\nEdit to add: my cousin is a SAHM and her husband works with stocks and he was also super active with their kiddos. The man had a complete nervous breakdown and had to be hospitalized due to the stress of trying to do it all. Get over yourself.", "I would say YTA here. For those 60 hours a a week he\u2019s at his solo job as a stockbroker, you\u2019re at your solo job as sahm.  If he works 5 days a week and takes 30 minutes for himself when he gets home, that\u2019s 2.5 hours a week that he uses for himself that\u2019s taken out of your \u201cshared\u201d time at home. If you go to brunch every week for an average of 2.5 hours, then that\u2019s 2.5 hours out of your \u201cshared\u201d time at home. That puts the two of you even. The way you want it, you get 2 1/2 hours of free personal time a week while he gets zero.  His wanting 30 minutes of alone time to unwind after work is perfectly reasonable seeing as how you get 2-3 hours every weekend to unwind at brunch.  Being at work as a stock broker isn\u2019t time where he\u2019s just chilling and socializing with friends like your brunches are. He\u2019s doing a high stress job where he could destroy someone\u2019s life, including your family\u2019s, if he messes up.  Being at home with kids is also a a high stress job, but he\u2019s giving you 2-3 hours a week to unwind. You don\u2019t want him to have any.  Unless he\u2019s forcing you to be a SAHM when you would rather have the kids in daycare while you work as well, you don\u2019t get to throw that in his face.", "YTA, he works long hours and brings all the money in, he's allowed 30 mins a day to decompress after coming home.\n\nAs a SAHM your literal job is to look after the kids. \n\nHe's right to be annoyed imo. Socialising at work is not fun socialising like you get to do at weekends either.", "YTA - idk why some people vote ESH, husband works 60 hours /week wants 30 minutes a day to decompress and after talking to him he actually agreed and removed his mieditation break. Besides probably when working 60 hours as stock trader he isn't all sunshine and rainbow with co-workers since it's high stress job.", "YTA. I've raised my kids, I watch my grandkids. No way (unless something is wrong) are a 4 and 5 year old more work than babies or toddlers. They are old enough to sit down, read a book and be good while their parent gets a few minutes to reset themselves. He is working himself into the ground, he only wanted a few minutes a day to ground himself. After working all day earning money to support the family. Wow.", "Info: Does he take the kids after meditation, and do you take a break at all then?\n\nEdit: fix the auto correct from meditation to mediation.", "INFO: are your kids in school? If not, why? If so, then that makes it even worse.", "It's 30 fucking minutes, it sounds like you need to take a break. YTA.", "YTA. Thirty minutes after work is not a huge ask. If it's all he needs to switch gears and be generally content that's amazing. You should get your time too. Sounds like your weekly brunch is a time for this. If you need additional relief you need to be specific and communicate that. \n\nYou are stressed, he is stressed, but 30 minutes after work is more than reasonable. He isn't shirking his responsibility. I think your stress level is clouding your judgment here. Unless there is more than this 30-minute break issue there is no way you are not TA here.", "YTA you're coming across as a stereotype of those domineering sitcom moms. \n\nYou both need time away r\nTo rax and breathe except that he's not getting that because you don't respect his work and what he brings", "YTA\n\nBoth his job and your role as a mum are more than likely equally stressful, no debate on that.\n\nThe difference is, you have downtime and he doesn't. Yes you may watch the kids, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel, eventually they will go to school/nursery, and you will have plenty of time to yourself. I'm also sure you have your moments where you get 20-30 minutes in peace \n\nHe doesn't get that, he works a highly stressful job surrounded by probably complete assholes, then Comes straight home.\n\nAlso I don't want to pry too much, but it really does sound like he's struggling with his mental health, Just the comments about him not getting his needs met, needing to reset etc. If he needs to take 30 minutes to reset himself, let him. He's going upstairs to nap for 15 minutes and to meditate, not leave you for 5 hours at the pub with the boys.\n\nI hope you manage to sort things out, I think you just need to give him a bit more space in general.", "YTA. Work is just as exhausting as being a SAHParent. Home is a safe place and a 30 minute breather is reasonable. Kids yelling, asking for things, being told X isnt broken, etc, it's stressful. I do the same thing for 15-20 minutes when i get home and I tell my kid to let me decompress. It's not unreasonable.", "YTA, honestly lucky to have him", "YTA.  Give the dude his break. \n\nIf you need more adult conversation then seek out a sahp group to meet up with and mingle.\n\nAlso, your kids are old enough for \u201cinside voice, inside speed\u201d teaching so they\u2019re not driving you bananas. Take them outside to get the energy burnt off then inside for indoor activity.", "And ur going to become a single parent if u keep this up, quit being so damn selfish, if he sacrifices his break, u should do the same", "YTA 30 minutes isn't too much to ask when transitioning from work mode to parent mode. It's a men are from Mars type thing. You may not understand it but please respect it. He has a high stress job that requires him to make high pressure snap decisions and I promise you, you don't want him carrying that over to family life. Honestly you should be thankful he manages himself that well.", "YTA. He works 60hrs a week to afford the LUXURY of you being a SAHM in a time when 60% of Americans (sorry if you\u2019re not from the US, I guess) are living pay check to pay check and struggling to pay rent.", "Yta, you said he takes the kids after, all he is asking for is 30 mins to get his head sorted properly. You are being very unreasonable here. Now you are wondering why he is irritable? He told you he need some down time after work for his mental health......", "YTA - sounds like originally he would come home from what you admit is a high stress, long hours job, take the 30min and then be able to be full on dad and help out. Now you\u2019re annoyed because you told him he couldn\u2019t take the time to decompress so his energy and patience isn\u2019t as high as you deemed it should be. \n\nIn your own comments you clearly show you\u2019re dismissive of his words and feelings that\u2019s he\u2019s expressed to you.

He is working 60 hours a week and you are SAHM. Then you leave for hours on the weekend. He didn't have an issue with it until you decided 30 mins out of the day was too much. YTA. You shouldn't be going to brunch every weekend for 3 hours if he cannot have 30 mins. Get a grip.", "In what fantasy land do you live in. YTA! Give your husband 30 minutes to wind down and cut those brunches down. \n\nBeing at work in a high stress environment isn\u2019t really socializing with other adults.

Why do you think it's okay for you to have personal time?  Your a parent 24/7.", "YTA if he really does not have any unwinding time, and he actually helps you with the kids outside of that 30 mins. It is fair for BOTH of you to have some time away from work and direct parenting. I get that the 30 minutes right when he\u2019s home from work are probably the worst (you\u2019ve been alone with the kids all day, you\u2019re fried, there\u2019s probably some coinciding with dinner, bath or bed time), so saying \u201cI know your meditation is important, but I\u2019m struggling to cope with bath time alone, especially after a whole day being alone with the kids.

Talk with your husband and see if there\u2019s stuff that can be done while you\u2019re both home to help out while it\u2019s just you (eg meal prep, getting clothes out for the kids the night before, laundry whatever).

I cant't believe all the y t a votes and I'm assuming none of them have experience in being the main caregiver for kids for a longer period of time. \n\nI have two kids and with our first kid I was at home with our child for the first year while my husband worked. He felt just like your husband that he was more entitled to alone time once he got home from work than I was, because I had been at home all day and he having no experience in it thought it was easy.  \n\nTruth is I was lonely, exhausted, touched out and losing my mind - if anyone's mental health was suffering it was mine. While at work my husband still got to go to the bathroom alone and in peace, got to out for lunch and eat his lunch while the food was still hot, got to enjoy adult company, got to sit in his car for the commute and listen to music he liked and had time for his own thoughts. I had none of that at home with the kids, not even a bathroom break. \n\nYour husband is failing at seeing your side of things while he's understandably mourning for the lack of alone time after work. But you're both full time parents even if he's away at work for the most of the day. It is what it is. \n\nMy relationship with my husband changed for the better when we swithed roles for 3months so that he was at home while I was at work before our first born started day care. After the 3months he agreed he had been in the wrong and no matter how hard it had been for him to return from work to the kids and not have any alone time at home after work, it was A LOT harder to be at home with the kids all day without any breaks. He apologized and we actually made plans to split parenting responsibilities more evenly from then on. For our second child he's spending 8 months at home and I'm staying at home the same. If this isn't financially possible for you in your country, I still incourage you to switch roles for atleast a few weeks or a month.\n\nSo I get that the 30mins is really important for his mental health, but then he should also understand how it's equally important for your mental health.

I am a SAHM but my husband has been working as stock trader for the past few years. He works long hours (\\~60 hours per week) so I appreciate that it's not an easy job\n\nEver since my husband started this job, he's been taking meditation breaks. Every time he would come home from work, he would go straight to the study and stay there for 30 minutes by himself. During that time he would nap for 15 minutes and then meditate for 15 minutes before he would come out and start helping out with the kids and the chores. \n\nI always thought it was weird but I didn't make a big deal out of it when our kids were smaller because they would sleep in the afternoons and I had a bit of a break. However, now that they're bigger, they don't want to sleep and they're always running around and need more attention from me so naturally I'm more exhausted now\n\nI told my husband that he can't keep taking these breaks when he comes home because it's exhausting for me to take care of 2 high energy kids all day. He said it's for his \"mental health\" so that he can switch to \"parent mode\" after a high stress day. I told him he's being ridiculous and being a parent is a 24/7 job. This sparked an argument where he said he needed those 30 minutes for himself but I foot down and told him that he can't shirk his responsibilities\n\nThat was 2 months ago and he hasn't been taking these breaks since. However, I've noticed that he's become more irritable and impatient especially towards me. I asked him what's the matter with him and he replied that he's the only one who's expected to make sacrifices for the family. I asked him what that's supposed to mean and he complained about how every Saturday morning I go out for brunch for 2-3 hours with my best friend while he never goes out on weekends and takes care of the kids. I told him that unlike him, I don't socialize with other adults because I'm at home all day but then he said being a parent is a 24/7 job and if he has to give up something that's important to him, then I should too. This sparked another argument which led to nowhere and after that was over he sarcastically said \"my needs are never important anyway\"\n\nOver the past 2-3 days, he's been sleeping on the couch. I don't think I'm the asshole but when I spoke to my sister, she told me I was being inconsiderate. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why do you insist he not take a break before he helps with the kids? Do you resent that you have to stay at home with the kids all day? Your kids are old enough that if you work with them they should be able to give you small breaks in the day.

As soon as he gets home she gets a fifteen minute break completely away from the kids - then he gets his normal half hour.  And if he wants some time with his friends on the weekend they need to work that out too.  No parent should be cut off from ever going out, and no one should be denied a break when they need it.  \n\nThey both seem pretty resentful.  Maybe it's time to re-evaluate her staying at home?  The kids are older, maybe close to school age, daycare and day camps are cheaper for older kids, (in relation to the cost for babies) they will get more out of socializing in school.

You are choosing to make your job staying at home with the kids, but you expect him to give you 2-3 hours a week for \u201cyou\u201d time, but you don\u2019t want to give him any.", "YTA. How about this? You go to work. He gets a job where he only has to work 40 hours a week. And my guess is he would gladly cut out the 2.5 hours of meditation time a week. And since work to you is socializing, you won\u2019t need those brunches anymore. \n\nYou sound ungrateful for what your husband does.", "Or he can just come home a half hour later and meditate in a park for a half hour.", "Do you love your husband, OP, or do you only see him as a paycheck and servant?", "Why does it have to be immediate? Is he a robot? Is he your bondservant?", "Then you can immediately start helping with the kids on Saturday mornings instead of going to brunch. Either you both get breaks from the kids/work or neither of you do.", "I\u2019m sorry. You aren\u2019t an AH, you\u2019re a selfish b!+ch!\n\nYour poor hubby!", "You'd understand if you had a job,  that's a bs expectation", "It is 30 mins. Put peppa pig on", "Would you feel differently if he went to the bathroom and took a shower with that half hour instead? I ask because it sounds like you have some resentment against him for getting out of the house more than you, and you feel that a nap and meditation aren't making constructive enough use of his time", "Would it be an option for you that he gets his 30min when he gets back from work and afterwards you get 30 min as well? I get that you are overwhelmed and frustrated but he seems to really need this half an hour to calm down and get out of work mode. Maybe there is a way to compromise here. Also you should keep your brunch and he should also get some hours off. You both need it.", "Maybe you should do a better job of being at home all day so there isn\u2019t a tonne of work left to be done when he gets home\n\nJesus, what a hypocrite", "YTA. If he needs 30 minutes to decompress and switch from business mode to family mode, give him the 30 minutes. Honestly, after reading your responses, you sound selfish.", "Yeah YTA", "He doesn't get my full vote for NTA because he seems to resent her for the time she spends with her friends. \n\nNot saying she is right. But the way he is handling this disagreement ain't that great either.\n\nSo to me, they both suck.", "Having married an ungrateful wife?", "Not brunch every week no. 3 hours every week???  Absolutely not every week. We have kid stuff to do. No one has that kind of time in this house. I specifically said brunch you\u2019ll notice. No I generally do not leave for 3 hours at a time.", "Clearly you didn't...if you can't even see how selfish your attitude is. Half an hour a day to let go of the stress of a full day of a very high stress environment isn't asking for much", "You\u2019re not a good partner. You are dismissive of a basic need. Shame on you.", "I regret to inform you that you, in fact, did not turn out fine. \n\nYou\u2019re husband and 95% of the people here are right: You don\u2019t care about his needs because they don\u2019t matter to you. He seems not to matter to you, or you wouldn\u2019t be arguing with everyone who says YTA", "You're right, all men are exactly the same and have the same needs and wants. Your husband isn't a carbon copy of your father so he must be broken or lying.", "Obviously as you\u2019ve seen he does need it. And you didn\u2019t turn out fine, your turned out to be a selfish AH.", "> and I turned out fine\n\nYour husband is clearly communicating something that he considers a need, and tou are completely dismissing him because other people aren't allowed to have different opinions or personalities to you. Rather than listening to someone you allegedly love and committed to, you are treating him like a household appliance who only exists to make your life easier.\n\nYou did not \"turn out fine\", you turned out unable to recognise your failings.", "Maybe you should plan your days better, declutter, simplify meals etc if things are too hard for you to lose out on 30 mins of help a day. Your current solution isn't working out for you, and you may be on your way to being a single mom full time.", "He\u2019s a stock trader!! There is no downtime for them!! If there was, do you think he\u2019d be working 60 hour weeks??", "Also, if he works for 60 hours a week, how many hours does he have left with the kids so that the kids are awake? The kids deserve to have time with their dad.", ">You get to have social conversation with your coworkers during meals and coffee breaks\n\nTell me you've never worked in your life without telling me you've never worked in your life. Coffee breaks? Lunch? I'm working through lunch and coffee breaks don't exist. And I'm not in a high stress environment like stock trading. 30 minutes to switch from work mode to dad mode after a 12 hour shift is a very small ask. Just like having a 3 hour brunch on Saturday is.", "again. Another reason I\u2019m afraid to get married.  Bust my ass, have zero free time, contribute 100 percent of the money, and still not appreciated. Instead get yelled at by some shrill woman that I can\u2019t have 30 minutes to myself.  OP is extremely entitled and doesn\u2019t deserve a husband like this.", "Maybe\u2026 being less irritable and impatient as you\u2019ve noticed, cause you expect him to come home from work and immediately work more? That seems to be a good guess at what he means", "Funny how the literal one comment that agrees with you is the only one you respond to. Not the 40+ telling you YTA.", "The fact that you are so blind to how reasonable his needing 30 minutes to adjust from his job is honestly really concerning. Married 10 years and you care so little for him. Wow. I think you are even more TA now. No one has even mentioned your kids are freaking school aged and you have massive child breaks throughout the day. SMH from one SAHM to another you are what gives us bad reputations.", "You sound so insensitive.", "It means exactly what it sounds like. He works 10+ hrs a day and needs 30 min of quiet to switch modes. This is not unreasonable to ask. He\u2019s been more irritable and impatient because he isn\u2019t getting this time that he needs. It\u2019s 30 min. Cut him some slack.", "He\u2019s just spent 12 hours working (not socializing, as you seem to equate it to). He doesn\u2019t need to decompress right before sleeping.\n\nHonestly, he should lie to you, do his mediating in the car, and then come in to work. That\u2019s why you\u2019re driving him to. YTa", "It means he won\u2019t get snappy at the kids, that he can give them his full attention, that he makes sure they see him at his best and that he\u2019s the best possible parent. Imagine having to do that after a seriously botched project. Would be hard to focus on kids while worrying about repercussions.", "So your kids aren't in Pre-K or any sort of care outside of the home even though the oldest is starting kindergarten this fall?", "Why don't you go back to work so he can stop working 60 hours a week? \n\nYTA", "Well it means he won\u2019t be irritable or sleeping on the couch.  YTA.  Ne doesn\u2019t WANT to go out on weekends.  He wants to take 30 min to decompress so he can spend quality time with his children.    \nWhy does he have to start helping right away?  What if he said \u201cyou can\u2019t go out on weekends because you should spend weekends with the family!, but you can take a 30 min walk every Night.\u201d. You\u2019d be livid.  Let the man spend his 3 hours a week however he wants, and you spend yours how you want.", "Maybe get a job and you\u2019ll understand?", "Not necessarily. Even if the kids are in another room doing whatever by themselves, parent is still on the clock, and that\u2019s a mentally taxing thing.", "Nailed it", "But if he cuts his hours then is she willing to downgrade her lifestyle, so yeah they have to have a compromise.", "That\u2019s true but maybe the extra income could go into paying for cleaners so that there are less chores to be split? It may be hard, but then again every lifestyle has its pros and cons. They need to sit down and talk things through to find what compromises can be made so that the relationship can pull through.", "And give it literally leas than a year and both children will be in school for most of the day.\n\nMeaning she will have a few hours per day with no kids.\n\nGoing up to 8-9 hours pay day with no kids for the next 13 years.", "Can confirm this. I asked many times for my ex to work less. He would not. Work was his identity and he had monetary goals, things he wanted to purchase, etc.", "Or maybe he *has* to work 60 hours a week, because he's the families sole source of income. If his wife was also paid working,and not a stay at home,then perhaps he wouldn't have to.", "Horror stories like this is why I \u201chave commitment issues\u201d.  I don\u2019t want a woman to suck the life out of me and ban me from taking 30 minutes to myself.  \n\nI feel bad for OPs husband.   Provides 100 percent of the money.  Works long hours, still spends time with kids on weekends and wants to be a good dad, and has a nag of a wife who doesn\u2019t appreciate it.\n\nIf courts didn\u2019t screw over men in divorce, this is where Ide bet the marriage is headed towards\n\n\n\nYTA", "I second this solution. I just hope the husband thinks about it cause his wife sure as shit isn\u2019t going to suggest it from her attitude", "Yes! Make that 30 mins downtime for everyone. She just wants to be angry at this point.", "Totally agree with you. He takes 30 minutes and then jumps in to help her. That\u2019s not unreasonable.", "Well the 30 minutes that he meditates are made up for with the 3 hours he has them when she goes to brunch, and 30minutes in a day is not exactly tipping the scales to being an absentee parent. Perhaps OP should get a job, then Dad can work less hours.", "Right. The whole thing needs to be them sitting down and working it all out \u2014 what the net gain will be after day care (since oldest is only in kindergarten), if he\u2019s willing or able to cut hours, etc. just saying it\u2019s not a clear cut \u201cwell she should go back to work then\u201d situation. They actually need to talk.", "Obviously none of u are stock brokers lol it's not a job u can cut back . If u want to be a stock broker u have to put that time in. His bosses probably think he s slacking only working 60 hrs lol", "Exactly. If my husband needs time to decompress from work I keep the kids quiet for a little bit. Why? Because he deserves it too.", "But she needs to listen because by her comments she thinks her husband is having fun at work all day long.", "See this is why I said they need to talk it out and figure out a way they can both be happy in this relationship. We don\u2019t know the ins and outs of their life. I don\u2019t know anything about his job. They do. They need to find solutions to themselves, maybe with a therapist to assist with communication. We won\u2019t be able to magically solve some very prevalent issues, we can only point out what OP shows us.", "If they can afford it, having this conversation with a couple's therapist might help make sure they both feel heard. Right now it sounds like they're both stressed and need a lifestyle change but don't know how to see the other side of the coin at the moment. Which isn't inherently bad! They both just need a breather.", "I agree"]}
