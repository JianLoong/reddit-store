The inheritance legally has passed to myself and my younger sister (21f). We also have an older half brother (40m) (same mum). My mum thinks it would be fairer to split the inheritance three ways and thinks I'm selfish for not doing so.\n\nMy dad was only in his 60's when he passed and hadn't made any arrangements/left a will etc. The only expression of his wishes I have is he named me as sole beneficiary to his pension. The only reason I think he left my younger sister off this is because it was 10 years ago that he made the declaration and she would only have been 11. My parents' divorce was \\*very\\* messy and I don't think he wanted to leave a chance that my mum would get access to the money. But he didn't name my half brother as one of the beneficiaries, which he could have done if he wanted to. Since my parents' divorce which was 20 years ago, my brother and my dad have had no relationship.\n\nIt's been a pretty traumatic year tbh from unexpectedly finding his body to having to sort out the funeral arrangements, clearing out his house and dealing with his estate single-handedly. This inheritance would for me and my sister provide us with some security and a step up to getting mortgages etc.\n\nMy brother has never really acted like a brother with us, he's quite selfish tbh. He's rarely around, has never helped me with anything, given me a birthday card, a christmas present etc. He's also terrible with money and lives paycheck to paycheck, spending it on gambling, at the pub etc. I would feel really resentful to volunarily give some of my inheritance away to have it wasted like this.\n\nMy mum has said if we don't split it evenly she will 'balance things out' by leaving him more in her will. I said that's totally up to her, her money to do as she wishes with. Then again I know it will be me who will be left to sort all of the admin out as I'm always expected to sort everything out cause I'm 'the sensible one'.\n\nI've tried to give the relevant background I can but I will update the post if you think anything else would be useful to know! Basically I'm a chronic people pleaser and I do to some extent get my mum's point that it 'isn't fair', but after the year I've had I feel like putting myself first for a change. So, what do you think? AITA??\n\nEDIT TO ADD:-\n\nMy brother never knew his dad, my dad was in his life since he was a toddler until he was grown (he would have been around 20 when my parents split).  \n\n\nTo be clear - my brother hasn't mentioned the inheritance to me at all or to my mum (he has very little contact with any of us as it is) - this is all coming from my mum that the money should be shared in her opinion.", "created_utc": 1701724117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18aue6b/aita_for_not_sharing_my_inheritance_with_my_half/", "score": 354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.", "Tell your mom that she can do whatever she wants with her money, but if she\u2019s determined to \u201cmake it fairer\u201d then she better name your brother executor of her will, because you already had to deal with everything on your own with your dad. It\u2019s only fair that he be the one that deals with her passing.", "NTA.  Do you think your mother might want you to do this because she's hoping your half brother might kick some back to her?", "Yes, this is what gets to me. Because she's asking me to give thousands away as if it's nothing. And to someone I don't have a relationship with. I'd rather give it to charity honestly! I'd like to see how much money my mum would give to him if she had an unexpected windfall...

You are quite right though that he would never share a penny with me if he got inheritance!! I think my mum feels sorry for him as well in that he is bad with money and struggles to hold down a job whereas me and my sister are more career focussed so are likely to be more successful in our own rights without inheritance. I know that's not the way the world works but I think this is where she is coming from.", "Thank you! Yeah, my dad's a pretty sensible person, I think if he had wanted my brother to have a share of the inheritance, he would have made provisions, knowing he would have no entitlement in law if he didn't - even just told me, or made a note of it somewhere, but nothing! My mum is making me feel guilty about it but honestly that's nothing new!", "I have split the pension with my sister! I know that's what my dad would have wanted. My brother has never known his dad and never shown any interest in knowing him. My brother hasn't mentioned anything about the inheritance (we hardly see him to speak to him anyway), this is all my mum!", "The saddest part is that my little sister and my dad never had a relationship because the divorce was such a mess. My mum used us as pawns and my dad noped out of it. We only retained our relationship because I was in my rebellious teen phase, but yeah, he chose to cut my mum off entirely and that meant my baby sis too unfortunately.", "Oh I won't give in, but she does make me feel like a bad person for it!", "He's never had a relationship with his bio dad, we don't know who he is. Well, my mum does. I guess this is partly why she thinks it's unfair.", "It was only his pension where he made an expression of wish.

I will work on it!!!", "My dad didn't leave a will. In my mum's opinion if he had got around to making a will, he would have split everything evenly between the three of us. I don't know what her basis for thinking that is. I think he just didn't bother to make a will as he intended to leave everything split between his bio kids so there was no need to make a will as the law would take care of it.

But as it is, I wouldn't consider giving him anything. The inheritance isn't huge, it will provide a decent house deposit for myself and for my sister. This wouldn't be an option for my brother anyway as he wouldn't be approved for a mortgage. I wouldn't be opposed to helping him out later in life, but where I'm at right now (renting and trying to save for a house) I don't feel in a position to be generous like this. That said later down the line I will probably have kids of my own to worry about and again would struggle to justify it.", "I think she would ask him to split it. Whether he would or not... He may well do as my mum is pretty bossy!! Though if his bio dad left him money I don't think she would ask him to split it, despite none of us ever having met the guy. She doesn't fund his lifestyle, she has in the past - he used to live with her until a few years ago and he would skip rent payments etc. But since moving out it has been a clean break.", "Or even a birthday text, or a message of condolence when my dad passed, or asking how I was after I found his body, I could go on! In fairness my mum was young when she had my brother.", "I agree with you I think it is unfortunate that my dad didn't choose to share equally amongst all of us, as of course I would have respected that wish, and I wouldn't be getting grief about if from my mum. I think part of it may be because he knows how bad my brother is with money. But he never spoke to me about this stuff so it is all my guesswork at the end of the day. And if I had a proper sibling relationship with my brother I think I would choose to share it still. Like I adore my little sis. If she had a different bio dad and my dad had left her nothing, I would share with her no question. How would you feel if similar happened with your kids? Would you hope they would choose to split things evenly?", "And also brother had no relationship with him so why would he expect anything?", "Your mom sees her as his golden child and thus if she can get somehow to get him some gold, she will.  Her money is yet to be seen if it will last to be inheriteded... will she have enough in her last days, or will your hb take it bits by bita before she goes...", "I did mention my brother's bio dad to her and it didn't go down well lol. They've never had a relationship, I doubt my brother would be left anything by him. I think this is why my mum thinks my dad's inheritance should be split between the three of us, as my dad is the closest thing my brother has to a dad.", "I agree about your mom's view of her oldest son. She wants to 'save' him by manipulating/badgering you to give him money. As if your happiness and quality of life is less valuable than his. \n\nHis gambling, money struggles, and inconsistent income, are reasons your father's gift to you **should not** be shared with him. It will not change his behavior and you will all witness him pissing it away while not building relationships with you and sis (the next generation). She also hopes your $$ will relive her from doling out $$ to him; at least for awhile. \n\nYour father decided to not gift his step-son. She is meddling with your dad's end of life wishes; a person she has not been married to for 20 years.  This is not your problem to fix. If she feels your inheritance portion from her should be reduced, so be it. Live peacefully and shut out her noise. She should have no say in this matter.", "That's on her.  You shouldn't be the one who gives up money because she had a child with a total deadbeat.  That was HER choice.", "Hugs. \n\nYeah, that can suck. \n\nYou can also just wait until after she dies and file the will and the paperwork retracting you being the executor. Then they put someone there on the case.\n\nYou won't have to worry about pleasing anyone then .", "It sounds like your brother kind of got a raw deal in the dad department, but that doesn't excuse his bad habits and lack of concern for you.\n\nThis is your inheritance.  If he were a great guy and financially responsible, I might consider gifting him something but I would never give away money to somebody who is bad with money.", "My brother hasn't said anything, this is all my mum saying I should share it. But you are right they don't have a relationship and haven't for the past 20 years.", "Thank you, I will try to live peacefully! I'm really glad I got some outside perspective on this as she is making me feel like a selfish person about it all, and I try to do the right thing in life. But I don't expect another windfall in my lifetime so I want to make the most of it and put it to the best use. I know I came by it easily but my dad worked hard for it, and I can't just hand it over to be frittered away.", "Your dad would have included your mum's son if he had wanted to.

No shit, he got to see his sister's continue to have a dad after the divorce and he didn't. That's a raw deal no matter what age.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your parents divorced when your brother was 20 years old.  Your brother was not related to your dad and did not maintain a relationship with your dad since the divorce.   You and your sister also have no relationship with your brother. Keep the money.  Also, where is your brother's bio dad?  Wouldn't he stand to inherit from his father?", "Your mum is being a ah", "If your father raised your brother from a toddler, seems to me he would expect that your brother would be included in the inheritance.  If he wastes the money, that's on him.  Always do the right thing. Remember, karma is a bitch.", "It seems like you don't even like him for good reason, and he wouldn't give you his inheritance if he didn't have to.", " You shouldn't be the one who gives up money because she had a child with a total deadbeat. That was HER choice.", "That is actually an hilarious question knowing my brother... Not a chance!!! She'd have much better luck asking me for money directly!", "Thank you! I'm sorry you've found yourself in a similar situation as well! I think I've struggled with reasoning it because my dad never left a will or spoke about it, and my mum has her own strong opinions, and in a way it does feel strange to 'inherit' money, in a way I do feel undeserving of it in that I've done nothing to earn it. But I guess that's inheritence for you! As you say death is hard enough to deal with as it is so it just drags you down when people want to fight about money. At the end of the day, it's really not important. I'd burn the lot if it would bring my dad back.", "I'll add it to the post to be clear but my brother has had no say in this at all, this is all what my mum thinks should happen.", "She's trying to buy a relationship with your brother with your money. She doesn't think it's 'fair', she thinks it's useful.", "Do not entertain the conversation with her. Tell her to make her will however she sees fit. Be firm and let her know you are done talking about it. If she brings it up, end the conversation. She will get it, eventually. Money brings out the worst in people! I also had inheritance drama. It\u2019s insane what people feel entitled to. Don\u2019t do anything you will regret. And I\u2019m going to tell you right now it will never be enough to them.", "Tell her you hope your brother is willing to be her retirement plan. He can care for her as she ages and deal with all the red tape when she passes.", "You can donate that to the help-a-brother-out foundation. Id use it to upgrade some audio/photo gear to help underprivileged youths break into the creative space lol. NTA!", "You have the \"Don't negotiate with terrorists\" approach down right.", "Good job! That is right. Do what you can for people you love. Maybe the Oldest Son has been good to his mother and warrants a larger inheritance from her? Maybe he hasn't? Either way, control the things you can, and don't worry about what you can't.", "Lol then it sounds like she wants him to get the money so she won't have to give him any in the future while she's still alive.", "I don't even think it would last him a year honestly!!", "I would just lie to your mom at this point and say a bunch of debt was found and the estate has to pay it and you and sister are being left with not much (of course you\u2019d have to get your sister in on this)."]}
