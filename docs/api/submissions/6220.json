Cool, you had sex and now you\u2019re cooking baby number 5, whatever.", "I'm going with NTA.  You are 19, and they are on their 5th kid.  Who would expect a teenager to be overly joyous at this point.  You told her that you were happy and that it should have been good enough.  I don't know why people think others should be jumping through the roof at this point. Especially, someone your age.", "Well, you didn't have to rant so long.   But I have to say NTA because she's the one who just had to push for the reaction she wanted.  I think people who push for big emotion filled reactions are annoying.", "Im a 5th child, and I know that my arrival couldn\u2019t have been as exciting for everyone as the first grandchild, or moms first kid or what ever, but I should would like to think that my grandparents and aunts and uncles were happy about my existence and supportive and everything. In other words, maybe it is less about you needing to be shocked and excited for her , and more that you will be there for the child still.", "Gotta go with NTA here - you weren\u2019t rude to not be super excited, and she had no reason to push you about it.  It sounds like maybe you could have worded it differently, but it\u2019s not like you led with that", "NTA and the YTA is ridiculous for me not everyone gonna show the same amount of excitement as other people. Op Clarify she was not rude until the sister responded  rudely to her and from the sounds of it she pushed op. Like ok you had sex, you made a human number 5. Not everyone going to be jumping for joy up and down all the time when people tell them good news", "NTA \n\nYou were initially polite and said \"cool awesome\" \nPeople need to understand that not everyone is gonna be super excited about pregnancy announcements.", "NAH- Your sister is allowed to be excited for each child. You are NTA for being over it at this point. A \u201ccongratulations\u201d would have been a better response, but I understand it\u2019s hard to be enthusiastic after that many pregnancies.", "Lmfao welp I guess your response was slightly better than just getting in her face and yelling \u201cwhat do you want from me?! It\u2019s a vagina, not a clown car!!\u201d", "I feel like there's more to this story than you're letting on.\n\nWhy was it important to mention that she's a SAHM and her husband fixes air conditioning? In the seven years they didn't have kids, what was going on?\n\nHonestly I think this isn't such a big deal for either of you and it seems like a regular sibling spat. Nothing worth calling anyone an AH over.", "If I were 18 I don't think I would even care about the first pregnancy announcement lol. NTA", "NTA. Maybe Kay has learned we should not ask questions to which we don't actually want answers.", "You are Schr\u00f6dingers AH. I get that you are not excited and you shouldn't have to act excited just so someone else can feel good. But the way you explained why you weren't excited comes off as rude.", "NTA.  People respond how they respond.  You aren't the father.  It is odd to me that she is this wrapped up in your response/reaction.", "NAH. You were polite, but not over the top. She pushed for more and got an honest answer she wasn't ready for.", "NTA\n\nPregnancy announcements are boring.", "NTA. You acknowledged what she said and attempted to feign enthusiasm, but your sister wasn't satisfied. Instead of just accepting your response, she criticized you for not being over-the-top happy about her announcement. She is the one who turned this non-issue into an issue.\n\nIt's her pregnancy and she needs to realize that other people aren't going to feel as excited about it as she is, especially when it's the fifth pregnancy. A person has to wonder if she's actually developed some kind of addiction to the attention she gets from being pregnant. Why else would she be dismayed when she didn't get the expected gush of enthusiasm?\n\nBy now, from your point of view, being pregnant is just her normal state of being and nothing to get super excited about. It's hard to sustain enthusiasm over events that go on over such a long time period. She's already spent 36 months, or approximately three years, being pregnant. It's become old hat to you by now. She needs to get over it and just enjoy being pregnant for its own sake and not expect others to react any particular way.", "NTA after the third baby people should expect a lack of enthusiasm. \n\nI have a couple of relatives who have had 5+ (one who has had 8 approximately 18 months apart) it's like hearing the sun rose at this point. \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. Everything you said was true, and it is weird that people think bringing a bunch of children into the world is something to be congratulated. With four children already with only one income, I am really questioning the finances of the couple and if they have thought about their children\u2019s futures. And does the oldest have the responsibility to take care of the younger ones of if they are pawned off on family to \u201cget some time\u201d to themselves, which is code for having another child. And if each child gets enough attention.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYour sister got pregnant the 5th time and no major complication occurred on that till now.  \nSo \"cool awesome\" would be an appropriate response provided you smiled and said it to her face directly instead of facing the TV.  \n\n\nwatching TV when any announcements were made in a family might not be the best policy.  \n\n\nExpecting you to jump up and down and get all excited might be too much of an expectation especially after the 3rd one.", "Good lord. Why is it such a terrible burden to be happy about the things that make someone you love happy? Are only firstborn children worth celebrating? Is a child less valuable because their mother doesn\u2019t struggle with infertility? You\u2019re N T A for not being overly effusive, but your speech about why this baby is no big deal to you puts you in YTA territory.", "NTA. This is her fifth pregnancy, she cannot possible expect you to be jumping up and down.", "NTA. Like you said, not her first time being pregnant. Like we get it, congratulations, but honestly not something I personally would be super excited for", "NAH. I can see both sides and neither of you are a-holes. This isn\u2019t new news, it\u2019s not surprising, and tbh I\u2019d actually start to wonder when they\u2019re gonna stop at this point. She\u2019s also valid for being a little upset by your reaction - to her this is still a big deal and in all fairness, just because she\u2019s had 4 already doesn\u2019t mean she should treat the 5th any differently just because she\u2019s done it before. But to expect you to be super happy and jumping around is unrealistic. If you want to maintain a good relationship with her though, maybe you could give her a congratulations card or something simple like that?", "NTA sounds like they are trying for a boy.", "NTA, although your delivery could have been a bit modified. I'm falling on your side because I sure didn't expect nearly the reaction with our second child as with the first, and I can't imagine expecting an OMG WOW reaction to a fifth.", "A pregnancy is a good event in someone's life but others can not give a fuck. As long as you don't opently disrespect the futur parent(s), you have the right to react as you want. And honestly, outside of the economical and ecological argument, I don't see why you should be over excited to know that your sister is going to have three toddlers under 5 and two teens to deal with at the same time. NTA.", "NTA. She asked , you answered. You\u2019re right she can\u2019t really expect you to be over the moon for ANOTHER baby\u2026 and no you shouldn\u2019t be forced to act or fake happiness just to spare her feelings?? You didn\u2019t even say anything \u201crude\u201duntil she kept pushing , you said cool she should have left it at that and not been annoying.", "You are entitled to feel however you feel, and no one can force you to react the way they want you to. NTA", "NTA at all. I\u2019m shocked by all the yta comments.\n\nYou made valid points . There was no issue of conceiving. No going to the dr trying to figure out why they can\u2019t conceive . She clearly asked you a question and you answered .\n\nI am one of 9 kids on my dads side and I am pretty confident by the time it was announced no one was jumping up and down or being overly  excited like how they would be with a first born.", "NTA- but the small rant was unnecessary and probably hurtful to her more than the \u2018lack of excitement\u2019. AH or not here, it\u2019d benefit both of you to just apologize for how you handled the situation.", "NTA", "i want to say, NTA. \n\nyou've been excited four other times already. why does she care so much about your reaction? just be more enthusiastic around the baby when it's born.", "NTA.  No one has the right to tell you how you should feel.  Your sister could have left it alone, but she chose to berate you for daring to not be jumping for joy because she procreated.  For the fifth time.  And had no issues getting pregnant.  Hell, you have the right to not be excited if it were baby number one with fertility issues.  What you do not have the right to do is be dismissive and snotty, even though I think your sister provoked you.  I'm giving you a pass for your sister starting it and your age, but please work on not arguing with someone when you damn will know no good will come of it.", "NTA\nYour sister is a drama queen", "NTA have they not realized where babies come from yet? JFC I can\u2019t imagine having that many kids and not having a game plan yet.", "NTA. It's not your job to be excited for your sister.", "Yeah YTA. I get your point, but it doesn't actually matter whether *you* are excited or not - your sister is excited, and it's kind to share/reflect back the excitement of those we love.", "NTA She brought four other humans into the world. What more did she expect?", "NTA, though I'm mainly saying this as I'm biased and don't think someone needs 5 kids in this day and age, especially with all the news of horrendous climate conditions in the next few decades and whatnot.", "Eh. YTA, A simple \u201ccongratulations\u201d would have been easier than all the effort you put into tearing her down lol. Couldn\u2019t even muster an \u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re happy\u201d ? \n\nWhy *did* you do that? Pregnancy announcements are boring but shaming the mothers excitement or wrecking their vibe never occurred to me as an appropriate reaction", "YTA\n\nAll you had to so was say congrats! But instead you said all of that.", "YTA\n\nWhen anyone you love is excited about something, be that a new job, a new baby or even if they are trying to crochet you support them and share in their excitement. It's called lifting the people up around you. Imagine your boyfriend started painting a new figurine. He paints these all the time and you are not really interested, but he is super excited about this new one and asks your opinion. You think it's nothing special. It doesn't matter, stop what you are doing and act interested. If you don't, people around you are going to feel that you don't really want to be part of there lives and they will stop showing you the things they like.", "NTA. But I think your over-explanation was a killjoy for everyone else. & I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that hard to show some support. You don\u2019t have to jump up & down raging excitement but \u201ccool, awesome\u201d sounds pretty dismissive to me too.", "NTA... COMPLETELY NTA", "NTA but you could have told her nicer unless you have to do something for her as a sister. Most likely helping with the kids ....if its true i totally get your reaction", "Soft YTA. All you had to do was smile and say congratulations. She didn\u2019t need a whole monologue about \u201chow you really feel\u201d.", "NTA, god I hate people like her, I guess I can't be happy for you without having to run a marathon for you.", "NTA", "YTA: This is one of those times you should react to be polite. It\u2019s like if someone gives you a gift but you wanted something else, you never tell them that. It\u2019s the same idea.", "You know YTA for being rude. That\u2019s the kind of shit you\u2019re welcome to think in your head but you don\u2019t say out loud to your sister FFS.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m with you. It\u2019s a vagina, not a clown car. And 5 kids\u2026the earth weeps. But still\u2026.don\u2019t be mean to your sister.", "NTA.", "YTA. It wouldn\u2019t have been hard to say congratulations rather taking 6x the effort to over explain why you don\u2019t care.", "Yeah YTA, I think you know it was an AH response even if its honest. Would it have killed you to say \"Congratulations, Im very happy for you\"?\n\nA lot of posters here need to watch the Big Lebowski \"You're not wrong, walter you just an AH\"", "YTA, sure, it's the fifth time you hear that sentence, it'd probably be the 100th time she'd throw up but she was still overjoyed, because it's a human life that'll be born to be loved, and it didn't take much out of your day to be happy for her about it. It's not about the pregnancy, it's about the baby, each baby is an individual being, 3rd one isn't boring because you've seen two already", "YTA \n\nNo need to go on a weird rant about it, could have just let it slide. The people who think you are not an asshole are like peak reddit. Even if it's not important to you, it is clearly important to them. This is, like, basic empathy 101.", "NTA. You did say \"cool, awesome\". What more does she want? A medal? A trophy?", "YTA. You know you were rude. How hard it is it to fake excitement for 15 minutes after she came over to make her announcement?", "YTA - You don't have to be overjoyed but come on.", "YTA. \n\nHave some manners & consid\u00e9ration for other people's feelings. All you had to was smile, give her a hug and ask when the baby's due.", "YTA it doesn\u2019t matter if they weren\u2019t trying for another baby or had no trouble conceiving this baby. You say she\u2019s been pregnant four other times so whatever, but this is a new child a different person than all your other nieces/nephews. No matter how many children someone has a new child is a big life change. You keep saying you weren\u2019t being rude but you were. How is not really paying attention and saying absolutely nothing in response to your own sisters pregnancy announcement until prompted not rude? No one\u2019s asking you to get up and scream, but you could at the very least be actively engaged in the conversation, smile at you sister sincerely, and say \u201ccongratulations, I\u2019m really happy for you!\u201d.", "All you had to do is hug her and say congratulations. YTA not for showing less enthusiasm but for going off as you did. Every pregnancy is different, and a fifth pregnancy is no less of a major event than, say, the second one. Just like a promotion at work is no less of an achievement than the first promotion you might receive.", "NTA.", "NTA. It's their 5th kid.", "haha. She seems like one of the people who thinks children are a gift from the world and wants more even thought it gets harder to support them. NTA buddy and tell her to stop getting fucked. Her husband might not like it anymore", "NAH. Though I get an impression you don't really approve of your sister's lifestyle and family size.", "YTA.\n\nYour argument is equivalent to saying that from the third child on, children are less loved. It also seems to me that your sister's reaction was exaggerated, taking into account that the great difference in age also conditions a difference in maturity, and she should have understood this in advance. \n\nThe fifth child and any other child is loved just as much as the first one, so their mere existence usually generates the same affection and the same illusion.", "YTA.\n\nI get this many kids in that the announcement of another one isn't super exciting, but you sound like a petulant teenager.", "YTA- it\u2019s not hard to put on a show and *pretend* to be excited. Your sister seems to really value your opinion! For her, a baby is exciting no matter what number it is. \n\nIt won\u2019t kill you to crack a smile and say congrats. Reach out, apologize, and move on. This is luckily an easy fix", "Soft YTA. I only lean towards this because she didn\u2019t need to hear the justification of it being her fifth not her first, etc. I don\u2019t know your relationship with your sister. Is it a good, healthy relationship? I personally have a horrible relationship with my sister. She\u2019s been awful my entire life. If you two are on good terms, I think the most beneficial thing for everyone is going to be an apology. Use \u201cI\u201d statements, not \u201cYou\u201d statements. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for how I made you feel when you announced your pregnancy. Is there anything I can do to help make it up to you?\u201d If your relationship is as contentious as mine and my sister\u2019s, then no, I wouldn\u2019t do much. Just an apology (you need to still take responsibility for your actions) and continue on with life.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nAfter the second child is not exited anymore...", "YTA \n\nI think not getting super excited was okay, but your response to her after she said that you didn\u2019t seem excited for her was rude. \n\nRegardless, if you value your relationship with your sister and family, it\u2019s best to just apologize in this situation.", "YTA. Could have just said I am happy for you, going off like you did in that follow up is incredibly rude. I get that your sister pushed it but you could have responded in many ways better ways than how you did. Being nice costs you nothing. Being excited about things your loved ones care about even though you personally don\u2019t care is part of being an empathetic person.", "ESH\n\nShe sucks for expecting a huge reaction out of you for her fifth child and getting annoyed at you for your reaction.\nYou suck because you didn\u2019t need to go off on her like that and give her a massive lecture.", "YTA for not saying congrats to your sister for being pregnant with a baby that was clearly welcomed by your sister and her husband. Whether it was a happy accident is absolutely irrelevant; the same goes for how many she kids has had before. You don't have to be excited (you're not having a baby, she is), but there's no harm in being polite and being happy *for* her.", "NTA. Holy Shit!! 5 kids. How do they afford and how do they deal with so many?", "Yta", "YTA you were probably sitting there looking sullen, should of just said congrats rather than this rant", "YTA not because of not getting excited, but for the unnecessary rant. You\u2019re right, a 5th child is not as exciting as baby #1. But maybe listening (or pretending to listen) and saying a simple \u201ccongratulations! I\u2019m happy for you!\u201d would have gone a long way. \n\nAlso it doesn\u2019t matter if the baby was hard to conceive or not. Don\u2019t know why you think that\u2019s relevant.", "YTA but you are only 18. I think our brains don't fully develop until we are 25 so you might not understand why you are in the wrong. When the kid is older make sure to spoil them at least.", "NTA. By the 5th time, it\u2019s kind of old news. Sure, maybe you could have pretended to be more excited for her, but that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole for being honest.", "NTA\nI think that ppl are not noticing the age difference between you and your sister.  They are getting bogged down on family and women and how you should be happy for her living her life. \n\n Your sister has been having kids since you were 7 and you don't seem to be terribly impressed with the people she is raising. So why be excited that there is another? I get it, though as you are not a child now, maybe you will like this new one. \n\nAs you are a teen who grew up with her constantly having kids, I'm not surprised by that reaction.  Let your mom be the jumping for joy one. I think you reacted just fine.", "Definetly NTA", "NTA. Your sister as a bit of a diva isn't she?", "YTA. You owe your sister an apology for your callous actions.", "YTA.  It's a human life!  It's still a big deal even though there's been humans born before!  If you personally weren't excited you still could have shared in her excitement. That's just really not too much to ask for a loved one.", "NTA for your response. Unless the \"cool awesome\" was sarcastic, you were plenty polite. I'm not sure what your sister expected, especially after she called you out for your lack of excitement. I think you're a little bit on an AH for paying attention to the tv when your sister came over to specifically share some news though.", "From a parent; NTA.\n\nIt's completely unreasonable to expect someone to fake a feeling they don't have.  Your sister's just being entitled.\n\nNot getting into the ethical issues with having *five* damn kids,  your sister has an unrealistic view, here.  No one owes her being excited.  No one even owes her approval.  And *you* certainly don't owe her an apology, for the reality check.\n\nYou were polite.  Your sister was unreasonable and then threw a tantrum.  You explained yourself.  She ran away from the situation.\n\nAt no point were you in the wrong.", "NTA. You weren't rude until she demanded more attention.", "ESH\n\nyou for being an AH\n\nthem for thinking everyone cares about their baby factory.", "NAH. You could\u2019ve had more tact in how you reacted because a pregnancy, no matter what number it is, is usually very special to a mother or incoming mother.

I mean your sister has been pregnant 4 times (now 5) since you were 7 years old, it's a pretty normal thing for you at this point. Like yeah maybe you could've faked it for her or kept the speech shorter, and if she's a SAHM this probably is very exciting for her, but idk why people would expect a teenager who's pretty much seen this person pregnant and having new babies her entire life to be that excited about another one.", "I don\u2019t think she was expecting you to be jumping for joy, but you didn\u2019t need to be rude to her about it. You might not be excited, but she is. Why does it have to be such a big burden for you to show some excitement for your sister? \nI don\u2019t like children, nor will I be having any, but when my siblings tell me about their pregnancies, I will be excited for them regardless of whether it\u2019s their 1st or 10th. \nI\u2019m so shocked by all these N-T-A. \nDefinitely YTA.", "NTA. You were not excited. You are allowed to not be excited! Your sister should accept that. Weird that she did not stay for dinner.", "YTA. There's a big difference between a sincere congratulations and \"jumping up and down\". Saying \"cool\" then going on a rant is rude and immature.", "NTA \npregnancy isn\u2019t even a big deal, yeah you\u2019re carrying a kid so what?", "NTA. I was super excited when my sister had her first baby! Then for the second too...and the 3rd was like, alright, now you're just costing me too much money with all these additional birthday and Xmas gifts, STOP IT. I am waiting for the announcement of #4, which will be met with an eye roll \ud83d\ude06", "I don\u2019t think you are necessarily wrong. I\u2019m sure it was a delivery/voice thing & she\u2019s also hormonal, so it might not hurt to apologize to keep the peace in this specific situation. \u201cI was & am excited for you & might not have shown it very well. I also know you are a good mom & will be one again.\u201d", "NTA. She is not obligated to be evicted for her sisters 5th pregnancy. And not be overly excited is not rude.", "Also sister made a mistake by expecting a very overjoyed reaction from OP. From the way it is written, it seemed like she expected OP to jump from the sofa and say \"omg sis i can't believe it! I'm sooooooooo happy for ya!!!\" When most ppl will probably say \"Oh nice. I'm happy for you.\"", "Plus with the 20 year age difference between OP and sister, it\u2019s hard to imagine them to be extremely close or having much in common. The sister was already having kids of her own by the time OP was old enough to have any semblance of a relationship. \n\nOP is closer in age to all four of her nieces (and the same will be true for the 5th) than she is to her sister. \n\nOP said congrats, sister pushed it for more of a response and didn\u2019t like the one she got so she stormed out. Either way she got to be the center of attention.\n\nNTA", "She didn't say she was happy for them she said \"cool awesome\". There's a big difference between a sarcastic \"cool\" and a sincere congratulations.", "Op responded with, \"cool, awesome\". What exactly was negative or unsupportive about that. Was she supposed to pop streamers & do a backflip?", "I can say as the parent of 5 kids our entire family was extremely excited about our fifth and final baby. Grandparent's, aunties, uncles + 4 very eager older siblings. For us we knew it was our last child and the family knew he would probably be the last baby until the next generation. \nWe were just as excited about our 5th as we were our first but not nearly as terrified.", "Exactly, Op had a polite first response and when pushed proceeded to explain. Some people with the Y T A are actively saying \"you should pretend\" What? Not all people react the same way and that's fine, such a big issue out of nothing.", "The OP said she initially ignored the announcement (although she heard it) because she was watching TV.  Really?  Then a sarcastic \"cool, awesome\"?  YTA.  The minimum polite response to someone happily announcing a pregnancy is \"congratulations\".", "I disagree about her being polite. In the circles I run in you would have to stop looking at the TV and look at her face while you congratulated her in order to be polite and from how she writes it doesn't sound like she did that. She doesn't have to be excited but she wasn't even polite. In fact every one I know would consider her outright rude for not even looking up from the TV.", "If I had a reward I'd give it to you", "cause I felt like if didn't add what they do or how she was SAHM. it might come as like they don't have steady careers or something if that makes sense", "Not sure I\u2019d expect anything different from an 18yo, tbh. In fact, at that age, I probably would have asked my sister if she knew how babies were made, since it was happening so often without purposely trying. NTA", "This who cares", "About your relative with the 8 kids 18 months apart - do they plan that? Or do they just end up getting pregnant at roughly 9 months after last baby? Either way, wow, that's 6 years of pregnancy how do people even do that???", "I agree, four kids is a lot. Don\u2019t see it in the comments so far but looks like they keep trying for that boy \ud83d\ude44", "I'm kinda shocked at how heartless most of the replies here are. I'm gonna be excited and congratulatory even if the lady at the newsstand tells me she's expecting, let alone my sister. And i don't even like kids! \n\nPeople on here talk about a new baby being born as if someone bought a new houseplant, ffs, even like it's an annoyance or like the sister is irritating for expecting family to care that a new child will be born. It's so weird to see. Guess reddit doesn't exactly gather the most socially sound people.", "i said that just to make sure it was not hard for to conceive this baby because it can be hard to be mothers and get pregnant again. i never said the baby was a big deal i was explain why my reaction was my reaction when she pushed me", "Why should she have to be happy? She was polite, and when Mom-to-be didn\u2019t get the attention she was angling for, she threw a tantrum and left. Children should be loved and appreciated, absolutely. But I\u2019m so sick of this whole culture where every pregnancy announcement has to include an entire family grinning and celebrating with a parade and a confetti canon. \n\nNTA, OP. You\u2019re fine.", "I'm not emotional like that. that's why I said oh cool awesome smiled at the both of them. she was expecting me to jump up and down for joy like my mom", "Yeh, it\u2019s such a weird reaction. All she had to do is get up, say \u201ccongrats, I\u2019m so happy for you\u201d and give a quick hug. That\u2019s it then she\u2019s done.\n\nInstead she goes on a weirdly long monologue about.\n\nPart of being in a family is pretending to be happy for others when it matters to them but not to you.", "NTA. She said cool. So now, there are certain words you have to convey in order to to be the AH. Give me a break!  And she said all of that after the sister didn\u2019t get what the words she wanted to hear.", "I mean, learning to crochet doesn't really belong in that list.\n\nIt's a far more fantastic achievement than either of the others.", "Op didn\u2019t say anything until her sister pushed for an answer", "I did tell her nice I was like \"oh cool and smiled\"", "I did smile she wanted me to be like \"OMG WOW\"", "When some gives you a gift you say \u201cthank you\u201d and go on about your day", "I was not rude I said oh cool that's awesome and gave then a quick smile and went back to the tv. she was expecting me to react like my mother like jump and down and be like \"OMG\"", "That is such a gross thing to say about women with more kids than you deem appropriate. Everyone is entitled to bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom and the clown car comparison is both tired and disgusting.", ">I was not rude I said oh cool that's awesome and gave then a quick smile and went back to the tv. she was expecting me to react like my mother like jump and down and be like \"OMG\"", "There is a 20 year age difference between the sisters. One is a teen who was 7 when the first kid was born, for her it is old hat. For the Expectant Sister, yes it is a big deal and a life change but she shouldn't be pushing g for the reactions she wants. \n\nI'm sure that the Mother of these two girls was really excited and was the person meant for the news. Yay, a new grandchild but the younger sister wasn't really involved in the conversation to begin with. \n\nThe Expectant Sister wanted the big reaction,  and is upset that she didn't get one. Plus maybe the OP, isn't happy. Would you want her to just lie? \n\nOP is NTA, let the Grandma be excited and let the teenager be pragmatic.", "You realize that at 18, she doesn't, know, understand, empathize or quite possibly care right? According to the numbers the OPs Sister has been pregnant and popping out kids for most of the OPs life. This is a norm to the OP. \nNTA", "Just no!!!", "You do know most folks who aren't the parents or grandparents usually aren't as excited by someone getting pregnant for more than the first time. After the first one most everyone is just faking it, still happy but not like they will talk about it more than \" hey so and so is pregnant\" then not think of it again. \n\nFact is OP is a teenager and teenagers are not going to put on a fake face for something that's not important to them personally. And no the following children are not loved less cuz they are number 3-4 or 5. The only thing that's lessened is OPs excitement for a pregnancy at kid number 5.\n\nSister is butthurt cuz HER pregnancy isn't the only thing OP cares about and celebrates. Also the mom is wrong for trying to force OP to be fake happier for something that's about as special as her sister getting a new house.\n\nNo one would be a happy and celebrating a 5th new house vs someone who's bought their first one. So stop thinking not caring that sister is pregnant for the fifth time and means OP will love said kid less.", "Op is a teenager??", "we are not super-duper close like that. she would drop the kids off to my mom's house on weekends so she can go out and drink with her friends and get breaks and we will watch them but, in the beginning, we close but drifted apart when she moved and talk in text like \"hey how are you?\"", "She said awesome and smiled. Like congrats you had sex and are adding a 5th. You can\u2019t expect people to react the way you want all the time.", "Spoiled children turn into brats tho. And aunts/uncles aren\u2019t obligated to.", "My. She\u2019s on her 5th dam baby. The sister was picking and OP was happy for her, did the sister want a dam parade. Nobody gets to tell you how to react to their news and she is not the AH.", "Just bc its a big deal to the parents doesn't mean anyone else is required to be moved with emotion.  She wished no ill will or anything bad.  At this point it's an underwhelming announcement.  The sister sounds like she likes be center of attention since she threw a fit, packed up everyone, and left.  That response to an 18f's reaction to baby 5, says a lot imo.  The baby machine sounds exhausting.", "First of all, no it's not. Second of all, this isn't some amazing thing... it's just a natural part of life.", "It is super easy for that phrase to sound like a dick comment. If the op said that in an unexcited tone it would come off as unsupportive", "Good for you. 5 kids are a lot.", "Exactly like ridiculous", "OPs first response was to stare at the TV and not say anything. How is that polite?", "Same!", "Esp. at baby number 5. OPs original reaction was sufficient, sister shouldn't have pushed because honestly as much as every baby is a person and deserves to be loved by the family etc, it's only to be expected that there is less fuss for each new child because it has happened before.", "This are all great questions. And ones most of us have had for years. \ud83d\ude33", "No one expected you to jump for joy or throw a parade. \n\nA \u201ccongratulations. How are you feeling? Are you hoping for a boy / girl\u201d, to your own sister doesn\u2019t seem like too much to ask for if that is someone you actually care about. \n\nFor the people you care about, you should  be able to get excited because they are excited, not just get excited because you are interested.", "Forget excitement. Are you happy for your sister?", "Yeah, I don't see what you could have done differently except having a marching band for them apparently. You did congratulate them.", "Edit:  not be the ah", "Cool is not the same as congratulations BTW", "Yea I don't know why I can't picture that maybe because i hate children. And pregnancy new is never a good news for me", "i agree with u.  u initially said awesome etc and smiled and then she has to push the envelope and u were honest in your response i dont find that rude at all.  i think the issue thou is she wanted the attn", "It's what you followed up with that was the problem.", "As I said in my comment, you can think whatever you want to think but still have the tact and wisdom to keep your mouth shut.", "Umm, your post says you continued with \u201cwell what do you want me to do? Jump up and down and scream my head off. I can see if this was like your first child that you were expecting, like a first time mother moment, you got four kids and on your fifth pregnancy by this time you get used to it.\u201d\n\n\u2026.you don\u2019t think that was rude? YTA.", "NTA she wa 4 please.", "Your making a lot of assumptions there. The post says the sister and BIL came over to tell them their news. There\u2019s no indication that OP wasn\u2019t involved in the conversation. OP gave no reaction to her sisters news at all. That is rude. I know families with large age gaps between sibling so the uncles/aunts are only slightly older than their nieces and nephews, they don\u2019t stare at the TV and pay no attention to their older siblings news. Even if OP doesn\u2019t care about her sister she is old enough to empathize with the situation. How is OP being pragmatic? She seems to be lacking a lot of empathy", "Could you please elaborate?", "Well, I still think it\u2019s a good idea to own up to how you made her feel. Apologize, and be mindful of how you act/speak in general. You\u2019re still young, and you\u2019ve mentioned you aren\u2019t really an \u201cemotional\u201d person, which is fine, but sometimes just checking your tone and/or body language. I found myself in similar situations as a teen because I spoke before I thought.", "Edit:  NTA", "She unnecessarily hurt her sisters feelings.", "And. That is not the only word to convey happiness for someone. She\u2019s an 18 year old with 4 nieces and the sister is pregnant again. No big deal. Cool, happy for you.", "yea see what you mean i dont like kids either. my older two nieces are rude all the time thats why i dont want any. but if was like she was expecting her first kid then the reaction would have been different. cause she is expecting the first child people tend to feel more overjoyed at that time if that makes sense", "Which wouldn't have happened if the sister didn't push it.", " if you expect someone to respond a different way to you that you don't like I don't know what you want me to.

You get what i mean. Keep the peace! And find a hole to hide when babysitting and favour calls start...... Wish you luck", "You asked.

You seem to have your mind made up (which is fine!)", "cause my mom thought I was rude. it like how you say something, and you were like \" oh did I said that or emphasize that word a certain way to sound rude\"", "You were rude. Your mum, who was there, says you were rude. Your sister and bil left because you were......rude."]}
