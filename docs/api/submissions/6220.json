Cool, you had sex and now you\u2019re cooking baby number 5, whatever.", "I'm going with NTA.  You are 19, and they are on their 5th kid.  Who would expect a teenager to be overly joyous at this point.  You told her that you were happy and that it should have been good enough.  I don't know why people think others should be jumping through the roof at this point. Especially, someone your age.", "Well, you didn't have to rant so long.   But I have to say NTA because she's the one who just had to push for the reaction she wanted.  I think people who push for big emotion filled reactions are annoying.", "Im a 5th child, and I know that my arrival couldn\u2019t have been as exciting for everyone as the first grandchild, or moms first kid or what ever, but I should would like to think that my grandparents and aunts and uncles were happy about my existence and supportive and everything. In other words, maybe it is less about you needing to be shocked and excited for her , and more that you will be there for the child still.", "Gotta go with NTA here - you weren\u2019t rude to not be super excited, and she had no reason to push you about it.  It sounds like maybe you could have worded it differently, but it\u2019s not like you led with that", "NTA and the YTA is ridiculous for me not everyone gonna show the same amount of excitement as other people. Op Clarify she was not rude until the sister responded  rudely to her and from the sounds of it she pushed op. Like ok you had sex, you made a human number 5. Not everyone going to be jumping for joy up and down all the time when people tell them good news", "NTA \n\nYou were initially polite and said \"cool awesome\" \nPeople need to understand that not everyone is gonna be super excited about pregnancy announcements.", "NAH- Your sister is allowed to be excited for each child. You are NTA for being over it at this point. A \u201ccongratulations\u201d would have been a better response, but I understand it\u2019s hard to be enthusiastic after that many pregnancies.", "Lmfao welp I guess your response was slightly better than just getting in her face and yelling \u201cwhat do you want from me?! It\u2019s a vagina, not a clown car!!\u201d", "I feel like there's more to this story than you're letting on.\n\nWhy was it important to mention that she's a SAHM and her husband fixes air conditioning? In the seven years they didn't have kids, what was going on?\n\nHonestly I think this isn't such a big deal for either of you and it seems like a regular sibling spat. Nothing worth calling anyone an AH over.", "If I were 18 I don't think I would even care about the first pregnancy announcement lol. NTA", "NTA. Maybe Kay has learned we should not ask questions to which we don't actually want answers.", "You are Schr\u00f6dingers AH. I get that you are not excited and you shouldn't have to act excited just so someone else can feel good. But the way you explained why you weren't excited comes off as rude.", "NTA.  People respond how they respond.  You aren't the father.  It is odd to me that she is this wrapped up in your response/reaction.", "NAH. You were polite, but not over the top. She pushed for more and got an honest answer she wasn't ready for.", "NTA\n\nPregnancy announcements are boring.", "NTA. You acknowledged what she said and attempted to feign enthusiasm, but your sister wasn't satisfied. Instead of just accepting your response, she criticized you for not being over-the-top happy about her announcement. She is the one who turned this non-issue into an issue.\n\nIt's her pregnancy and she needs to realize that other people aren't going to feel as excited about it as she is, especially when it's the fifth pregnancy. A person has to wonder if she's actually developed some kind of addiction to the attention she gets from being pregnant. Why else would she be dismayed when she didn't get the expected gush of enthusiasm?\n\nBy now, from your point of view, being pregnant is just her normal state of being and nothing to get super excited about. It's hard to sustain enthusiasm over events that go on over such a long time period. She's already spent 36 months, or approximately three years, being pregnant. It's become old hat to you by now. She needs to get over it and just enjoy being pregnant for its own sake and not expect others to react any particular way.", "NTA after the third baby people should expect a lack of enthusiasm. \n\nI have a couple of relatives who have had 5+ (one who has had 8 approximately 18 months apart) it's like hearing the sun rose at this point. \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. Everything you said was true, and it is weird that people think bringing a bunch of children into the world is something to be congratulated. With four children already with only one income, I am really questioning the finances of the couple and if they have thought about their children\u2019s futures. And does the oldest have the responsibility to take care of the younger ones of if they are pawned off on family to \u201cget some time\u201d to themselves, which is code for having another child. And if each child gets enough attention.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYour sister got pregnant the 5th time and no major complication occurred on that till now.  \nSo \"cool awesome\" would be an appropriate response provided you smiled and said it to her face directly instead of facing the TV.  \n\n\nwatching TV when any announcements were made in a family might not be the best policy.  \n\n\nExpecting you to jump up and down and get all excited might be too much of an expectation especially after the 3rd one.", "Good lord. Why is it such a terrible burden to be happy about the things that make someone you love happy? Are only firstborn children worth celebrating? Is a child less valuable because their mother doesn\u2019t struggle with infertility? You\u2019re N T A for not being overly effusive, but your speech about why this baby is no big deal to you puts you in YTA territory.", "NTA. This is her fifth pregnancy, she cannot possible expect you to be jumping up and down.", "NTA. Like you said, not her first time being pregnant. Like we get it, congratulations, but honestly not something I personally would be super excited for", "NAH. I can see both sides and neither of you are a-holes. This isn\u2019t new news, it\u2019s not surprising, and tbh I\u2019d actually start to wonder when they\u2019re gonna stop at this point. She\u2019s also valid for being a little upset by your reaction - to her this is still a big deal and in all fairness, just because she\u2019s had 4 already doesn\u2019t mean she should treat the 5th any differently just because she\u2019s done it before. But to expect you to be super happy and jumping around is unrealistic. If you want to maintain a good relationship with her though, maybe you could give her a congratulations card or something simple like that?", "NTA sounds like they are trying for a boy.", "NTA, although your delivery could have been a bit modified. I'm falling on your side because I sure didn't expect nearly the reaction with our second child as with the first, and I can't imagine expecting an OMG WOW reaction to a fifth.", "A pregnancy is a good event in someone's life but others can not give a fuck. As long as you don't opently disrespect the futur parent(s), you have the right to react as you want. And honestly, outside of the economical and ecological argument, I don't see why you should be over excited to know that your sister is going to have three toddlers under 5 and two teens to deal with at the same time. NTA.", "NTA. She asked , you answered. You\u2019re right she can\u2019t really expect you to be over the moon for ANOTHER baby\u2026 and no you shouldn\u2019t be forced to act or fake happiness just to spare her feelings?? You didn\u2019t even say anything \u201crude\u201duntil she kept pushing , you said cool she should have left it at that and not been annoying.", "You are entitled to feel however you feel, and no one can force you to react the way they want you to. NTA", "NTA at all. I\u2019m shocked by all the yta comments.\n\nYou made valid points . There was no issue of conceiving. No going to the dr trying to figure out why they can\u2019t conceive . She clearly asked you a question and you answered .\n\nI am one of 9 kids on my dads side and I am pretty confident by the time it was announced no one was jumping up and down or being overly  excited like how they would be with a first born.", "NTA- but the small rant was unnecessary and probably hurtful to her more than the \u2018lack of excitement\u2019. AH or not here, it\u2019d benefit both of you to just apologize for how you handled the situation.", "NTA", "i want to say, NTA. \n\nyou've been excited four other times already. why does she care so much about your reaction? just be more enthusiastic around the baby when it's born.", "NTA.  No one has the right to tell you how you should feel.  Your sister could have left it alone, but she chose to berate you for daring to not be jumping for joy because she procreated.  For the fifth time.  And had no issues getting pregnant.  Hell, you have the right to not be excited if it were baby number one with fertility issues.  What you do not have the right to do is be dismissive and snotty, even though I think your sister provoked you.  I'm giving you a pass for your sister starting it and your age, but please work on not arguing with someone when you damn will know no good will come of it.", "NTA\nYour sister is a drama queen", "NTA have they not realized where babies come from yet? JFC I can\u2019t imagine having that many kids and not having a game plan yet.", "NTA. It's not your job to be excited for your sister.", "Yeah YTA. I get your point, but it doesn't actually matter whether *you* are excited or not - your sister is excited, and it's kind to share/reflect back the excitement of those we love.", "NTA She brought four other humans into the world. What more did she expect?", "NTA, though I'm mainly saying this as I'm biased and don't think someone needs 5 kids in this day and age, especially with all the news of horrendous climate conditions in the next few decades and whatnot.", "Eh. YTA, A simple \u201ccongratulations\u201d would have been easier than all the effort you put into tearing her down lol. Couldn\u2019t even muster an \u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re happy\u201d ? \n\nWhy *did* you do that? Pregnancy announcements are boring but shaming the mothers excitement or wrecking their vibe never occurred to me as an appropriate reaction", "YTA\n\nAll you had to so was say congrats! But instead you said all of that.", "YTA\n\nWhen anyone you love is excited about something, be that a new job, a new baby or even if they are trying to crochet you support them and share in their excitement. It's called lifting the people up around you. Imagine your boyfriend started painting a new figurine. He paints these all the time and you are not really interested, but he is super excited about this new one and asks your opinion. You think it's nothing special. It doesn't matter, stop what you are doing and act interested. If you don't, people around you are going to feel that you don't really want to be part of there lives and they will stop showing you the things they like.", "NTA. But I think your over-explanation was a killjoy for everyone else. & I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that hard to show some support. You don\u2019t have to jump up & down raging excitement but \u201ccool, awesome\u201d sounds pretty dismissive to me too.", "NTA... COMPLETELY NTA", "NTA but you could have told her nicer unless you have to do something for her as a sister. Most likely helping with the kids ....if its true i totally get your reaction", "Soft YTA. All you had to do was smile and say congratulations. She didn\u2019t need a whole monologue about \u201chow you really feel\u201d.", "NTA, god I hate people like her, I guess I can't be happy for you without having to run a marathon for you.", "NTA", "YTA: This is one of those times you should react to be polite. It\u2019s like if someone gives you a gift but you wanted something else, you never tell them that. It\u2019s the same idea.", "You know YTA for being rude. That\u2019s the kind of shit you\u2019re welcome to think in your head but you don\u2019t say out loud to your sister FFS.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m with you. It\u2019s a vagina, not a clown car. And 5 kids\u2026the earth weeps. But still\u2026.don\u2019t be mean to your sister.", "NTA.", "YTA. It wouldn\u2019t have been hard to say congratulations rather taking 6x the effort to over explain why you don\u2019t care.", "Yeah YTA, I think you know it was an AH response even if its honest. Would it have killed you to say \"Congratulations, Im very happy for you\"?\n\nA lot of posters here need to watch the Big Lebowski \"You're not wrong, walter you just an AH\"", "YTA, sure, it's the fifth time you hear that sentence, it'd probably be the 100th time she'd throw up but she was still overjoyed, because it's a human life that'll be born to be loved, and it didn't take much out of your day to be happy for her about it. It's not about the pregnancy, it's about the baby, each baby is an individual being, 3rd one isn't boring because you've seen two already", "YTA \n\nNo need to go on a weird rant about it, could have just let it slide. The people who think you are not an asshole are like peak reddit. Even if it's not important to you, it is clearly important to them. This is, like, basic empathy 101.", "NTA. You did say \"cool, awesome\". What more does she want? A medal? A trophy?", "YTA. You know you were rude. How hard it is it to fake excitement for 15 minutes after she came over to make her announcement?", "YTA - You don't have to be overjoyed but come on.", "YTA. \n\nHave some manners & consid\u00e9ration for other people's feelings. All you had to was smile, give her a hug and ask when the baby's due.", "YTA it doesn\u2019t matter if they weren\u2019t trying for another baby or had no trouble conceiving this baby. You say she\u2019s been pregnant four other times so whatever, but this is a new child a different person than all your other nieces/nephews. No matter how many children someone has a new child is a big life change. You keep saying you weren\u2019t being rude but you were. How is not really paying attention and saying absolutely nothing in response to your own sisters pregnancy announcement until prompted not rude? No one\u2019s asking you to get up and scream, but you could at the very least be actively engaged in the conversation, smile at you sister sincerely, and say \u201ccongratulations, I\u2019m really happy for you!\u201d.", "All you had to do is hug her and say congratulations. YTA not for showing less enthusiasm but for going off as you did. Every pregnancy is different, and a fifth pregnancy is no less of a major event than, say, the second one. Just like a promotion at work is no less of an achievement than the first promotion you might receive.", "NTA.", "NTA. It's their 5th kid.", "haha. She seems like one of the people who thinks children are a gift from the world and wants more even thought it gets harder to support them. NTA buddy and tell her to stop getting fucked. Her husband might not like it anymore", "NAH. Though I get an impression you don't really approve of your sister's lifestyle and family size.", "YTA.\n\nYour argument is equivalent to saying that from the third child on, children are less loved. It also seems to me that your sister's reaction was exaggerated, taking into account that the great difference in age also conditions a difference in maturity, and she should have understood this in advance. \n\nThe fifth child and any other child is loved just as much as the first one, so their mere existence usually generates the same affection and the same illusion.", "YTA.\n\nI get this many kids in that the announcement of another one isn't super exciting, but you sound like a petulant teenager.", "YTA- it\u2019s not hard to put on a show and *pretend* to be excited. Your sister seems to really value your opinion! For her, a baby is exciting no matter what number it is. \n\nIt won\u2019t kill you to crack a smile and say congrats. Reach out, apologize, and move on. This is luckily an easy fix", "Soft YTA. I only lean towards this because she didn\u2019t need to hear the justification of it being her fifth not her first, etc. I don\u2019t know your relationship with your sister. Is it a good, healthy relationship? I personally have a horrible relationship with my sister. She\u2019s been awful my entire life. If you two are on good terms, I think the most beneficial thing for everyone is going to be an apology. Use \u201cI\u201d statements, not \u201cYou\u201d statements. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for how I made you feel when you announced your pregnancy. Is there anything I can do to help make it up to you?\u201d If your relationship is as contentious as mine and my sister\u2019s, then no, I wouldn\u2019t do much. Just an apology (you need to still take responsibility for your actions) and continue on with life.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nAfter the second child is not exited anymore...", "YTA \n\nI think not getting super excited was okay, but your response to her after she said that you didn\u2019t seem excited for her was rude. \n\nRegardless, if you value your relationship with your sister and family, it\u2019s best to just apologize in this situation.", "YTA. Could have just said I am happy for you, going off like you did in that follow up is incredibly rude. I get that your sister pushed it but you could have responded in many ways better ways than how you did. Being nice costs you nothing. Being excited about things your loved ones care about even though you personally don\u2019t care is part of being an empathetic person.", "ESH\n\nShe sucks for expecting a huge reaction out of you for her fifth child and getting annoyed at you for your reaction.\nYou suck because you didn\u2019t need to go off on her like that and give her a massive lecture.", "YTA for not saying congrats to your sister for being pregnant with a baby that was clearly welcomed by your sister and her husband. Whether it was a happy accident is absolutely irrelevant; the same goes for how many she kids has had before. You don't have to be excited (you're not having a baby, she is), but there's no harm in being polite and being happy *for* her.", "NTA. Holy Shit!! 5 kids. How do they afford and how do they deal with so many?", "Yta", "YTA you were probably sitting there looking sullen, should of just said congrats rather than this rant", "YTA not because of not getting excited, but for the unnecessary rant. You\u2019re right, a 5th child is not as exciting as baby #1. But maybe listening (or pretending to listen) and saying a simple \u201ccongratulations! I\u2019m happy for you!\u201d would have gone a long way. \n\nAlso it doesn\u2019t matter if the baby was hard to conceive or not. Don\u2019t know why you think that\u2019s relevant.", "YTA but you are only 18. I think our brains don't fully develop until we are 25 so you might not understand why you are in the wrong. When the kid is older make sure to spoil them at least.", "NTA. By the 5th time, it\u2019s kind of old news. Sure, maybe you could have pretended to be more excited for her, but that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole for being honest.", "NTA\nI think that ppl are not noticing the age difference between you and your sister.  They are getting bogged down on family and women and how you should be happy for her living her life. \n\n Your sister has been having kids since you were 7 and you don't seem to be terribly impressed with the people she is raising. So why be excited that there is another? I get it, though as you are not a child now, maybe you will like this new one. \n\nAs you are a teen who grew up with her constantly having kids, I'm not surprised by that reaction.  Let your mom be the jumping for joy one. I think you reacted just fine.", "Definetly NTA", "NTA. Your sister as a bit of a diva isn't she?", "YTA. You owe your sister an apology for your callous actions.", "YTA.  It's a human life!  It's still a big deal even though there's been humans born before!  If you personally weren't excited you still could have shared in her excitement. That's just really not too much to ask for a loved one.", "NTA for your response. Unless the \"cool awesome\" was sarcastic, you were plenty polite. I'm not sure what your sister expected, especially after she called you out for your lack of excitement. I think you're a little bit on an AH for paying attention to the tv when your sister came over to specifically share some news though.", "From a parent; NTA.\n\nIt's completely unreasonable to expect someone to fake a feeling they don't have.  Your sister's just being entitled.\n\nNot getting into the ethical issues with having *five* damn kids,  your sister has an unrealistic view, here.  No one owes her being excited.  No one even owes her approval.  And *you* certainly don't owe her an apology, for the reality check.\n\nYou were polite.  Your sister was unreasonable and then threw a tantrum.  You explained yourself.  She ran away from the situation.\n\nAt no point were you in the wrong.", "NTA. You weren't rude until she demanded more attention.", "ESH\n\nyou for being an AH\n\nthem for thinking everyone cares about their baby factory.", "NAH. You could\u2019ve had more tact in how you reacted because a pregnancy, no matter what number it is, is usually very special to a mother or incoming mother.

I'm assuming there's at least se level of familial relationship there.\n\nAnd like I said, if OP doesn't like her sister for some reason that's different. But I've had more sincere congratulations for cousins I've met like four times. Because they're happy and I'm happy for them.\n\nI get how OP would have this kind of response. I just think it's kind of an AH move.", "This made me laugh and is great.", "INFO: are you a teenager?", "Exactly.", "Dude all you had to do is say congratulations and give a half assed hug, you have a lot of growing up and learning how to live among people to do", "Like, OP pretty clearly acted like a sulky teenager, and couldn't even manage a bit of polite enthusiasm at Sister's announcement. \n\nOk fine, teens are gonna teen. \n\nWhere it goes into AH territory is trying to justify bad manners with a rant. \n\nAnd here are the sulky teens of Reddit, coming up with justifications.\n\nAnd I doubt Sister was trying to pressure OP, she was probably just a bit gobsmacked at the poor manners. Even if you don't care, you put on a smile for things your loved ones care about.", "Sister probably mustered up, at minimum, a smile and a cherry \"congratulations\" when OP graduatted.", "Do you even have loved ones? Is this how you behave around your friends and family. God it must be draining to be around you.", "Op in the comments stated that her and her sister aren't close, and that her oldest nieces are so rude to the point she don't see herself having kids. \nWhy should she care again about her sisters who is 20 years older than her 5th pregnancy?\nThat was a rhetorical question btw. I don't care about your opinion and there's hundreds of people commenting go argue with them.", "I\u2019m betting on the not caring. 20 years means that her sister was most likely out of the house by the time OP was born. She had her first kid when OP was 7. How can they possibly relate to one another?", "Can I get a link? It sounds like a nice read", "Why should she be forced to fake a reaction though? It\u2019s not her baby and the huge age gap leads me to believe they\u2019re not all that close.", "I think it just comes down to the type of reaction that people need. \n\nFor me, I prefer honest. The \u201ccool, awesome\u201d would be fine for me. I don\u2019t want a bunch of phony congrats. I also don\u2019t like the idea of pushing someone into a different reaction if you don\u2019t like the first one. \n\nSister clearly wants a bit of a hoopla. That\u2019s fine, but she is going to have to learn to temper her expectations in some cases, or else she\u2019s gonna have a bad time.", "Nobody is obligated to fake any emotions/reactions/anything to satisfy others, family or not. If you think people do YOU have growing to do. \n\nOP congratulated her in an age appropriate way (\"cool awesome\" is a likely way for teens to 20 somethings to respond to any positive news) \n\nThinking she shouldn't have spoken her mind, should've held her tongue and just faked everything isn't sound/helpful advice. It's the exact advice that gave all of our parents & grandparents emotional intelligence problems.", "Nope. She has said they aren't close.   \n\n\nHer social obligations were met with \"Cool, awesome\" which acknowledged it was happy news for her sister.   \n\n\nHer sister, who by the way is 20 years older than her, should have been adult enough to accept that.", "I do have loved ones and OPs reaction wouldn\u2019t be mine as I tend to be an overly effusive and kind person no matter what - but that doesn\u2019t mean OP is an asshole for not fulfilling that social norm.\n\nMaybe reconsider insulting strangers online for how they interpret OPs actions? There\u2019s really no need to be rude to me. You don\u2019t know me. \n\nYou can disagree without attacking the person you\u2019re talking to and, generally, attacking based off of one interaction is seen as a sign of immaturity.", "She should include that info if she wants to be seen as not an ah. But I didn\u2019t come to argue.", "[Here ya go!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zznazk/aita_for_leaving_dinner_early_and_causing_a_scene/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)", "Have you ever gotten a present that you didn't particularly care for? Did you say thanks anyway? Or did you go into a long speech about how gift giving should be what the person definitely wants?", "I think there might be something missing from the tone here, but I very much read the \"cool, awesome\" as sarcastic.\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm saying OP is the AH for not being genuinely happy for her sister. Not for not having a fake reaction. I think it's pretty clear that OP doesn't give a shit, and unless there's a reason OP doesn't like her sister, it's weird to care so little.\n\nLike OP's sister wasn't asking for a 15 minute display. Only a genuine expression of her joy for her sister and OP couldn't provide that. It's not like OP did something cruel or evil. She just lacks empathy for her family and to me that's AH behavior.", "Emotional intelligence and being kind to others don't cancel eachother out man", "It doesn't matter how close they are. Are some of you really that socially unaware that you don't know how to behave? First day being a human idk?", "Seriously this. A nearly 40 year old woman should not be shaming a 19 year old for not reacting the way she wanted.   \n\n\nDo people live their lives walking on eggshells around their families? This is nuts.", "According to me she\u2019s an asshole. She upset her sister for no reason. She chose to be an ass instead of being nice.", "I do say thanks. But if someone was pushing me for a \u201cbetter\u201d response, I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019d be willing to play the game before it got annoying. OP has a short fuse in that regard. \n\nIt\u2019s extremely clear that these two people are not very close. The main reason I\u2019m giving the OP slack with the \u201ccool awesome\u201d response is because she probably thought their mom covered the ecstatic response that the sister wanted.", "I didn\u2019t read it as sarcastic.\n\nOP isn\u2019t an A H for not genuinely caring. Why should she? Not everyone has good and/or close relationships with every member of their family. That doesn\u2019t make a person an A H.", "She wasn't obligated to be more than polite. She was polite.   \n\n\nAlso you're being intentionally insulting. Any particular reason you needed to personally insult me for having a different opinion than yours?", "Yeah, you can think that. My question is why attack me? I didn\u2019t do anything to you. \n\n\u201cGod, it must be draining to be around you\u201d\n\nRude, unnecessary, defend your argument without resorting to such rhetoric."]}
