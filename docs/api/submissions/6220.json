I was focusing on the tv. then my sister says, \"so what do you think about the news\"\n\nI said, **\"cool awesome\"**. then my sister says, **\"just cool, you don't seem that excited for me?\"** and I said \" **well what do you want me to do? jump up and down and scream my head off. I can see if this was like your first child that you were expecting, like a first-time mother moment, you got four kids and on your fifth pregnancy by this time you get used to it. was this baby really hard to conceive, like was it hard to like to get pregnant?** and Kay said, **\" no it just happened, I took the test a week ago\"** and I said, \" **ok then, so at a certain point after find number 3 people reaction is not going to be that enthusiastic as if was you were expecting with your first**\"  Kay said **\" I thought you will be happy for me\"** and I was like I am but it's not that expecting for me since you been pregnant before. she got mad and left with her husband and kids and did not stay for dinner.  my mom thinks I should apologize to kay for not be excited about her pregnancy announcing. so reddit am I AITA.\n\nEdit: I just want to clarify that this fifth baby was not a baby that was hard to conceive, or they had been trying and wanting a fifth baby. it just happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 2: i have been finically supporting her other kids giving her money and food constantly and babysitting her kids so she can go out every weekend to hang out with friends.

Cool, you had sex and now you\u2019re cooking baby number 5, whatever.", "I'm going with NTA.  You are 19, and they are on their 5th kid.  Who would expect a teenager to be overly joyous at this point.  You told her that you were happy and that it should have been good enough.  I don't know why people think others should be jumping through the roof at this point. Especially, someone your age.", "Well, you didn't have to rant so long.   But I have to say NTA because she's the one who just had to push for the reaction she wanted.  I think people who push for big emotion filled reactions are annoying.", "Im a 5th child, and I know that my arrival couldn\u2019t have been as exciting for everyone as the first grandchild, or moms first kid or what ever, but I should would like to think that my grandparents and aunts and uncles were happy about my existence and supportive and everything. In other words, maybe it is less about you needing to be shocked and excited for her , and more that you will be there for the child still.", "Gotta go with NTA here - you weren\u2019t rude to not be super excited, and she had no reason to push you about it.  It sounds like maybe you could have worded it differently, but it\u2019s not like you led with that", "NTA and the YTA is ridiculous for me not everyone gonna show the same amount of excitement as other people. Op Clarify she was not rude until the sister responded  rudely to her and from the sounds of it she pushed op. Like ok you had sex, you made a human number 5. Not everyone going to be jumping for joy up and down all the time when people tell them good news", "NTA \n\nYou were initially polite and said \"cool awesome\" \nPeople need to understand that not everyone is gonna be super excited about pregnancy announcements.", "NAH- Your sister is allowed to be excited for each child. You are NTA for being over it at this point. A \u201ccongratulations\u201d would have been a better response, but I understand it\u2019s hard to be enthusiastic after that many pregnancies.\n\nEdit: NTA with that update. Having a 5th child when she is taking money from an 18 year-old is irresponsible. Don\u2019t give her your money and time anymore.", "Lmfao welp I guess your response was slightly better than just getting in her face and yelling \u201cwhat do you want from me?! It\u2019s a vagina, not a clown car!!\u201d", "I feel like there's more to this story than you're letting on.\n\nWhy was it important to mention that she's a SAHM and her husband fixes air conditioning? In the seven years they didn't have kids, what was going on?\n\nHonestly I think this isn't such a big deal for either of you and it seems like a regular sibling spat. Nothing worth calling anyone an AH over.", "If I were 18 I don't think I would even care about the first pregnancy announcement lol. NTA", "NTA. Maybe Kay has learned we should not ask questions to which we don't actually want answers.", "You are Schr\u00f6dingers AH. I get that you are not excited and you shouldn't have to act excited just so someone else can feel good. But the way you explained why you weren't excited comes off as rude.", "NTA.  People respond how they respond.  You aren't the father.  It is odd to me that she is this wrapped up in your response/reaction.", "NAH. You were polite, but not over the top. She pushed for more and got an honest answer she wasn't ready for.", "NTA\n\nPregnancy announcements are boring.", "NTA. You acknowledged what she said and attempted to feign enthusiasm, but your sister wasn't satisfied. Instead of just accepting your response, she criticized you for not being over-the-top happy about her announcement. She is the one who turned this non-issue into an issue.\n\nIt's her pregnancy and she needs to realize that other people aren't going to feel as excited about it as she is, especially when it's the fifth pregnancy. A person has to wonder if she's actually developed some kind of addiction to the attention she gets from being pregnant. Why else would she be dismayed when she didn't get the expected gush of enthusiasm?\n\nBy now, from your point of view, being pregnant is just her normal state of being and nothing to get super excited about. It's hard to sustain enthusiasm over events that go on over such a long time period. She's already spent 36 months, or approximately three years, being pregnant. It's become old hat to you by now. She needs to get over it and just enjoy being pregnant for its own sake and not expect others to react any particular way.", "NTA after the third baby people should expect a lack of enthusiasm. \n\nI have a couple of relatives who have had 5+ (one who has had 8 approximately 18 months apart) it's like hearing the sun rose at this point. \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. Everything you said was true, and it is weird that people think bringing a bunch of children into the world is something to be congratulated. With four children already with only one income, I am really questioning the finances of the couple and if they have thought about their children\u2019s futures. And does the oldest have the responsibility to take care of the younger ones of if they are pawned off on family to \u201cget some time\u201d to themselves, which is code for having another child. And if each child gets enough attention.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYour sister got pregnant the 5th time and no major complication occurred on that till now.  \nSo \"cool awesome\" would be an appropriate response provided you smiled and said it to her face directly instead of facing the TV.  \n\n\nwatching TV when any announcements were made in a family might not be the best policy.  \n\n\nExpecting you to jump up and down and get all excited might be too much of an expectation especially after the 3rd one.", "Good lord. Why is it such a terrible burden to be happy about the things that make someone you love happy? Are only firstborn children worth celebrating? Is a child less valuable because their mother doesn\u2019t struggle with infertility? You\u2019re N T A for not being overly effusive, but your speech about why this baby is no big deal to you puts you in YTA territory.", "NTA. This is her fifth pregnancy, she cannot possible expect you to be jumping up and down.", "NTA. Like you said, not her first time being pregnant. Like we get it, congratulations, but honestly not something I personally would be super excited for", "NAH. I can see both sides and neither of you are a-holes. This isn\u2019t new news, it\u2019s not surprising, and tbh I\u2019d actually start to wonder when they\u2019re gonna stop at this point. She\u2019s also valid for being a little upset by your reaction - to her this is still a big deal and in all fairness, just because she\u2019s had 4 already doesn\u2019t mean she should treat the 5th any differently just because she\u2019s done it before. But to expect you to be super happy and jumping around is unrealistic. If you want to maintain a good relationship with her though, maybe you could give her a congratulations card or something simple like that?", "NTA sounds like they are trying for a boy.", "NTA, although your delivery could have been a bit modified. I'm falling on your side because I sure didn't expect nearly the reaction with our second child as with the first, and I can't imagine expecting an OMG WOW reaction to a fifth.", "A pregnancy is a good event in someone's life but others can not give a fuck. As long as you don't opently disrespect the futur parent(s), you have the right to react as you want. And honestly, outside of the economical and ecological argument, I don't see why you should be over excited to know that your sister is going to have three toddlers under 5 and two teens to deal with at the same time. NTA.", "NTA. She asked , you answered. You\u2019re right she can\u2019t really expect you to be over the moon for ANOTHER baby\u2026 and no you shouldn\u2019t be forced to act or fake happiness just to spare her feelings?? You didn\u2019t even say anything \u201crude\u201duntil she kept pushing , you said cool she should have left it at that and not been annoying.", "You are entitled to feel however you feel, and no one can force you to react the way they want you to. NTA", "NTA at all. I\u2019m shocked by all the yta comments.\n\nYou made valid points . There was no issue of conceiving. No going to the dr trying to figure out why they can\u2019t conceive . She clearly asked you a question and you answered .\n\nI am one of 9 kids on my dads side and I am pretty confident by the time it was announced no one was jumping up and down or being overly  excited like how they would be with a first born.", "NTA- but the small rant was unnecessary and probably hurtful to her more than the \u2018lack of excitement\u2019. AH or not here, it\u2019d benefit both of you to just apologize for how you handled the situation.", "NTA", "i want to say, NTA. \n\nyou've been excited four other times already. why does she care so much about your reaction? just be more enthusiastic around the baby when it's born.", "NTA.  No one has the right to tell you how you should feel.  Your sister could have left it alone, but she chose to berate you for daring to not be jumping for joy because she procreated.  For the fifth time.  And had no issues getting pregnant.  Hell, you have the right to not be excited if it were baby number one with fertility issues.  What you do not have the right to do is be dismissive and snotty, even though I think your sister provoked you.  I'm giving you a pass for your sister starting it and your age, but please work on not arguing with someone when you damn will know no good will come of it.", "NTA\nYour sister is a drama queen", "NTA have they not realized where babies come from yet? JFC I can\u2019t imagine having that many kids and not having a game plan yet.", "NTA. It's not your job to be excited for your sister.", "Yeah YTA. I get your point, but it doesn't actually matter whether *you* are excited or not - your sister is excited, and it's kind to share/reflect back the excitement of those we love.", "NTA She brought four other humans into the world. What more did she expect?", "NTA, though I'm mainly saying this as I'm biased and don't think someone needs 5 kids in this day and age, especially with all the news of horrendous climate conditions in the next few decades and whatnot.", "Eh. YTA, A simple \u201ccongratulations\u201d would have been easier than all the effort you put into tearing her down lol. Couldn\u2019t even muster an \u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re happy\u201d ? \n\nWhy *did* you do that? Pregnancy announcements are boring but shaming the mothers excitement or wrecking their vibe never occurred to me as an appropriate reaction", "YTA\n\nAll you had to so was say congrats! But instead you said all of that.", "YTA\n\nWhen anyone you love is excited about something, be that a new job, a new baby or even if they are trying to crochet you support them and share in their excitement. It's called lifting the people up around you. Imagine your boyfriend started painting a new figurine. He paints these all the time and you are not really interested, but he is super excited about this new one and asks your opinion. You think it's nothing special. It doesn't matter, stop what you are doing and act interested. If you don't, people around you are going to feel that you don't really want to be part of there lives and they will stop showing you the things they like.", "NTA. But I think your over-explanation was a killjoy for everyone else. & I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that hard to show some support. You don\u2019t have to jump up & down raging excitement but \u201ccool, awesome\u201d sounds pretty dismissive to me too.", "NTA... COMPLETELY NTA", "NTA but you could have told her nicer unless you have to do something for her as a sister. Most likely helping with the kids ....if its true i totally get your reaction", "Soft YTA. All you had to do was smile and say congratulations. She didn\u2019t need a whole monologue about \u201chow you really feel\u201d.", "NTA, god I hate people like her, I guess I can't be happy for you without having to run a marathon for you.", "NTA", "YTA: This is one of those times you should react to be polite. It\u2019s like if someone gives you a gift but you wanted something else, you never tell them that. It\u2019s the same idea.", "You know YTA for being rude. That\u2019s the kind of shit you\u2019re welcome to think in your head but you don\u2019t say out loud to your sister FFS.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m with you. It\u2019s a vagina, not a clown car. And 5 kids\u2026the earth weeps. But still\u2026.don\u2019t be mean to your sister.", "NTA.", "YTA. It wouldn\u2019t have been hard to say congratulations rather taking 6x the effort to over explain why you don\u2019t care.", "Yeah YTA, I think you know it was an AH response even if its honest. Would it have killed you to say \"Congratulations, Im very happy for you\"?\n\nA lot of posters here need to watch the Big Lebowski \"You're not wrong, walter you just an AH\"", "YTA, sure, it's the fifth time you hear that sentence, it'd probably be the 100th time she'd throw up but she was still overjoyed, because it's a human life that'll be born to be loved, and it didn't take much out of your day to be happy for her about it. It's not about the pregnancy, it's about the baby, each baby is an individual being, 3rd one isn't boring because you've seen two already", "YTA \n\nNo need to go on a weird rant about it, could have just let it slide. The people who think you are not an asshole are like peak reddit. Even if it's not important to you, it is clearly important to them. This is, like, basic empathy 101.", "NTA. You did say \"cool, awesome\". What more does she want? A medal? A trophy?", "YTA. You know you were rude. How hard it is it to fake excitement for 15 minutes after she came over to make her announcement?", "YTA - You don't have to be overjoyed but come on.", "YTA. \n\nHave some manners & consid\u00e9ration for other people's feelings. All you had to was smile, give her a hug and ask when the baby's due.", "YTA it doesn\u2019t matter if they weren\u2019t trying for another baby or had no trouble conceiving this baby. You say she\u2019s been pregnant four other times so whatever, but this is a new child a different person than all your other nieces/nephews. No matter how many children someone has a new child is a big life change. You keep saying you weren\u2019t being rude but you were. How is not really paying attention and saying absolutely nothing in response to your own sisters pregnancy announcement until prompted not rude? No one\u2019s asking you to get up and scream, but you could at the very least be actively engaged in the conversation, smile at you sister sincerely, and say \u201ccongratulations, I\u2019m really happy for you!\u201d.", "All you had to do is hug her and say congratulations. YTA not for showing less enthusiasm but for going off as you did. Every pregnancy is different, and a fifth pregnancy is no less of a major event than, say, the second one. Just like a promotion at work is no less of an achievement than the first promotion you might receive.", "NTA.", "NTA. It's their 5th kid.", "haha. She seems like one of the people who thinks children are a gift from the world and wants more even thought it gets harder to support them. NTA buddy and tell her to stop getting fucked. Her husband might not like it anymore", "NAH. Though I get an impression you don't really approve of your sister's lifestyle and family size.", "YTA.\n\nYour argument is equivalent to saying that from the third child on, children are less loved. It also seems to me that your sister's reaction was exaggerated, taking into account that the great difference in age also conditions a difference in maturity, and she should have understood this in advance. \n\nThe fifth child and any other child is loved just as much as the first one, so their mere existence usually generates the same affection and the same illusion.", "YTA.\n\nI get this many kids in that the announcement of another one isn't super exciting, but you sound like a petulant teenager.", "YTA- it\u2019s not hard to put on a show and *pretend* to be excited. Your sister seems to really value your opinion! For her, a baby is exciting no matter what number it is. \n\nIt won\u2019t kill you to crack a smile and say congrats. Reach out, apologize, and move on. This is luckily an easy fix", "Soft YTA. I only lean towards this because she didn\u2019t need to hear the justification of it being her fifth not her first, etc. I don\u2019t know your relationship with your sister. Is it a good, healthy relationship? I personally have a horrible relationship with my sister. She\u2019s been awful my entire life. If you two are on good terms, I think the most beneficial thing for everyone is going to be an apology. Use \u201cI\u201d statements, not \u201cYou\u201d statements. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for how I made you feel when you announced your pregnancy. Is there anything I can do to help make it up to you?\u201d If your relationship is as contentious as mine and my sister\u2019s, then no, I wouldn\u2019t do much. Just an apology (you need to still take responsibility for your actions) and continue on with life.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nAfter the second child is not exited anymore...", "YTA \n\nI think not getting super excited was okay, but your response to her after she said that you didn\u2019t seem excited for her was rude. \n\nRegardless, if you value your relationship with your sister and family, it\u2019s best to just apologize in this situation.", "YTA. Could have just said I am happy for you, going off like you did in that follow up is incredibly rude. I get that your sister pushed it but you could have responded in many ways better ways than how you did. Being nice costs you nothing. Being excited about things your loved ones care about even though you personally don\u2019t care is part of being an empathetic person.", "ESH\n\nShe sucks for expecting a huge reaction out of you for her fifth child and getting annoyed at you for your reaction.\nYou suck because you didn\u2019t need to go off on her like that and give her a massive lecture.", "YTA for not saying congrats to your sister for being pregnant with a baby that was clearly welcomed by your sister and her husband. Whether it was a happy accident is absolutely irrelevant; the same goes for how many she kids has had before. You don't have to be excited (you're not having a baby, she is), but there's no harm in being polite and being happy *for* her.", "NTA. Holy Shit!! 5 kids. How do they afford and how do they deal with so many?", "Yta", "YTA you were probably sitting there looking sullen, should of just said congrats rather than this rant", "YTA not because of not getting excited, but for the unnecessary rant. You\u2019re right, a 5th child is not as exciting as baby #1. But maybe listening (or pretending to listen) and saying a simple \u201ccongratulations! I\u2019m happy for you!\u201d would have gone a long way. \n\nAlso it doesn\u2019t matter if the baby was hard to conceive or not. Don\u2019t know why you think that\u2019s relevant.", "YTA but you are only 18. I think our brains don't fully develop until we are 25 so you might not understand why you are in the wrong. When the kid is older make sure to spoil them at least.", "NTA. By the 5th time, it\u2019s kind of old news. Sure, maybe you could have pretended to be more excited for her, but that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole for being honest.", "NTA\nI think that ppl are not noticing the age difference between you and your sister.  They are getting bogged down on family and women and how you should be happy for her living her life. \n\n Your sister has been having kids since you were 7 and you don't seem to be terribly impressed with the people she is raising. So why be excited that there is another? I get it, though as you are not a child now, maybe you will like this new one. \n\nAs you are a teen who grew up with her constantly having kids, I'm not surprised by that reaction.  Let your mom be the jumping for joy one. I think you reacted just fine.", "Definetly NTA", "NTA. Your sister as a bit of a diva isn't she?", "YTA. You owe your sister an apology for your callous actions.", "YTA.  It's a human life!  It's still a big deal even though there's been humans born before!  If you personally weren't excited you still could have shared in her excitement. That's just really not too much to ask for a loved one.", "NTA for your response. Unless the \"cool awesome\" was sarcastic, you were plenty polite. I'm not sure what your sister expected, especially after she called you out for your lack of excitement. I think you're a little bit on an AH for paying attention to the tv when your sister came over to specifically share some news though.", "From a parent; NTA.\n\nIt's completely unreasonable to expect someone to fake a feeling they don't have.  Your sister's just being entitled.\n\nNot getting into the ethical issues with having *five* damn kids,  your sister has an unrealistic view, here.  No one owes her being excited.  No one even owes her approval.  And *you* certainly don't owe her an apology, for the reality check.\n\nYou were polite.  Your sister was unreasonable and then threw a tantrum.  You explained yourself.  She ran away from the situation.\n\nAt no point were you in the wrong.", "NTA. You weren't rude until she demanded more attention.", "ESH\n\nyou for being an AH\n\nthem for thinking everyone cares about their baby factory.", "NAH. You could\u2019ve had more tact in how you reacted because a pregnancy, no matter what number it is, is usually very special to a mother or incoming mother.

She got upset because I didn't get all exuberant about her announcement and called me homophobic.  Like I told her, I don't care whom she choose to love, just as long as she is happy.  She didn't need my approval to be who she is and whom she wants be with.\n\nThis is not OP's sister's first nor second child, so saying \"cool, awesome\" is not a dickish response as it was an type of \"Good for you\" response.

It's about respect.\n\n And maybe it's not even just about that, maybe it goes deeper. Maybe OP has been unfairly parentified and lashed out because they were thinking about all the new work the adults in their life were expected to do. (I don't remember OP's gender, btw.) Maybe they've been emotionally or otherwise neglected or abused because their parents are overworked grandparents. Maybe OP has been stressed watching how their sister has struggled under the weight of parenting that many children. Maybe there's something else going on entirely.\n\nBut OP, YTA here. \n\nSomeone who i can't remember who was wise and/or spiritual or otherwise respected enough to get quoted enough that it got to me a few times was, before speaking, consider that there are three gates your words must travel through before they are given voice. There must be a yes answer to, \n\nIs this true?\n\nIs this necessary?\n\nIs this kind? \n\nFor me personally, if someone is unkind to me first, i allow myself some retribution unkindness alongside boundary setting. But your sister wasn't being unkind to you. She's been surprised by an unplanned baby. I guarantee you the road between that positive pregnancy test and her announcement has been a roller coaster. Her life is about to turn upside down all over again. But she is acting in accordance with her own conscience and keeping the child. And happy joyful memories alongside major life events sustain us. We need our people, and we need to relish our celebrations with loved ones when we can, because so much else in life is so. fucking. hard.\n\nWhy did you feel the need to behave hurtfully? It would be impossible to be in her position and not feel hurt by your words and actions. You went from neutral to toxic in a heartbeat.\n\nThat's not how functional adults communicate one's upset. You can speak your truth and share your feelings without lashing out at people you love and who love you. It's a skill to develop, and if you have any emotional dysregulation related to neurodivergence, mental illness, or trauma, it's going to be a harder road. But you can't go out into the world like this. You will destroy and weigh down all your relationships.\n\nI encourage you to pop in for a visit with the school counselor, or talk with your mom about mental health resources that appeal to you. I'm concerned that the lashing out stems from something else in your life that needs addressing and you could use a little healing. If you figure out the words around why you may have felt like reacting that way, hurtful on purpose, initiate a conversation. Yes, i believe you owe an apology to whoever was in the room. Nobody did anything to you but try to pull you in to the moment, which regardless of your opinion, is a big one for your family. You don't have to manufacture enthusiasm but you to need to behave like a member of a damn society, here. And a family, too. You didn't need to piss all over their memories (in a way they will *always* remember, because it's tied to a major life event) to be heard.

There are also times when the people that you love are either ones you shouldn't because they're terrible people (I'm not saying the sister is) or that you should still love them but that they just emotionally or physically drain you. OP's sis's oldest daughter is 11 and they are 18. If they started babysitting and helping financially since the first kid, the had to help adult since they were 7 and that is not a child's responsibility to raise someone else's child especially so the parents can go party every weekend.

It's fine to address their thoughts but they words they chose to use to express their view point were not appropriate for the situation\n\nOP's sis isn't the Ahole but should note that not every one is going to be overly excited for everything you do/say and that you can't control what others say or do, only how you react to it.

She was obviously distracted by something else and being surprised by a pregnancy announcement after it's already been done several times before is more normal than it is a surprise. \n\nPlus OP, who again is 18/19 years old, has already said that for a while she has spent some of her own money to help her older sisters kids out just so that her sis could afford to \"go out\". She was still a CHILD when she did those things, and while I'm not sure whether that was by OP's choice or forceful coercion by family members, it's ridiculous that a 38 year old woman/parent expects a teen/young adult to immediately be jumping for joy in this situation. For OP, this is something that happens regularly and costs other family members money when they're not the ones who made the choice to have another child on finances that cannot sustain doing so.\n\nAnd while OP's response wasn't the nicest thing to say it does not go far enough to make her an asshole - just blunt and not well thought out. Hard to do that when someone is immediately demanding an unfiltered explanation. Sis got what she asked for yet had the audacity to be upset afterwards without even giving OP a chance.\n\nIn the end I get that sis is excited about the \"miracle of life\" but she is a way more grown adult who is acting immaturely just because she didn't get the exact response she wanted from a way younger sibling.

And they have the gall to get upset that you aren\u2019t overjoyed by yet another mouth they can\u2019t support? Honestly that is irresponsible breeding on their part, especially if they can\u2019t  support the ones they already have.", "Nta. Especially in light of the fact that you are actively subsidizing their brood with food, cash, and free childcare. \n\nTime to cut the purse strings, OP. \n\nBut honestly, you reacted quite mildly for someone who's actively being taken advantage of.", "NTA. \nIf you\u2019ve been helping support the first 4, it\u2019s understandable that you might not be excited that sis is having another child that she cannot afford to support on her own.", "What is with all the people I read about who expect others to act or react a certain way? Your feelings are your feelings. NTA.", "NTA. So many conflicts in this world stem from people expecting you to have the emotional reactions they want from you instead of letting you just have your own.", "NTA, your sister is 38, already has 4 young children they can\u2019t afford. You an 18yo has to help support HER family?  Then she has the audacity to expect you to be happy they\u2019re adding one more? OP, I think you seriously need to pull back on the free babysitting and start looking out for YOUR life and future. You need to become unavailable.  Your mom is so excited, she can take over the babysitting on the weekends.  Please take care of you.  Hugs. Again NTA", "NTA and you\u2019re not obligated to financially support their family. Give a gift and step back.", "NTA but also\u2026you\u2019re 18 and giving your 38yr old sister with soon to be 5 kids support money? On what planet is that ok? For me that only adds to why I wouldn\u2019t be thrilled to hear she was pregnant again.", "NTA.\n\nSis could have timed her announcement better to get a better response. Perhaps waiting half an hour for dinner?\n\nShe was pushing to force a reaction that was not genuine, and with the timing off she got back all those reasons, which were really \u2018I\u2019m trying to watch TV here.\u2019\n\nSounds like she was trying to pull rank over whatever you were doing.\n\nWait - you give her money? So she can\u2019t afford the kids she has? Why should another one be good news to anyone?", "Though I get all the Y T A s, I feel like edit 2 says a lot. Clearly her sister doesn't have the means to support her 4 children let alone a 5th. When you have your 18 year old sibling is taking on responsibility for caring for your children (not just babysitting which is still a lot to do with 4 kids, but paying for FOOD), a responsibility she clearly doesn't want, it shows that you should not be having more children. As another parentified kid, it is fucking exhausting. Yes, I believe in being happy for other people's happiness, but I alson don't think we should be congratuating irresponsible parents having more kids than they can handle and shoving the burden of supporting them on family who didnt ask. This type of behavior makes me so mad. I feel truly sorry for the children in this situation and I agree that OP should do everything to make the child feel loved, but at this point I don't believe the mother deserves congratulations.\n\n\nEdit: Just read OP's update/more details. With the additional information, 100% NTA. We should not congratulate and enable people having more kids when they abaolutely do not have the means. OP is doing everything she can to support her sister's children but the sister does not deserve praise for being irresponsible!", "Honestly, NTA. The fact that you\u2019re barely an adult and you\u2019ve been financially supporting her and doing free babysitting for four other kids is insane. It\u2019s understandable to be less than enthused. Another kid means more money from you. Maybe your wording was a little cold, but honestly when you\u2019re only 18 and giving someone who is twenty years older than you financially stability for her children? I can\u2019t blame you for being cold.", "NTA. You owe no one your excitement if you don\u2019t feel it. You said cool. You are 18. Your sister needs to chill.", "NTA, completely NTA, you haven\u2019t been rude you\u2019ve just explained yourself it\u2019s not like you said \u201clook I don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re having another child fuck off\u201d you said you think it\u2019s cool, and then she responded so you elaborated, don\u2019t feel bad, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, NTA.", "Soooo\u2026 a 38 year old mother of 4 gets devastated that her teenage sister didn\u2019t jump for joy at being an auntie for the 5th time?", "NTA You have no obligation to produce enthusiasm for effect.", "NTA and personally I think its wrong that a 38 y.o. sister is taking money from an 18 y.o. sister to help pay for her kids.  I also hope she\u2019s paying you for babysitting so she can go hang out with her friends every weekend, but I doubt it.  No wonder you\u2019re not excited.", "I\u2019m the only one of 9 siblings who doesn\u2019t (and can\u2019t) have kids. Still expected to buy presents for all 12 nieces and nephews, birthdays and Christmas. I\u2019ve been lectured on numerous occasions that presents ($50+) don\u2019t demonstrate enough love. I\u2019m not rich.

Whether it's the first, or the fifth. No one is entitled to an excited reaction from anyone. No one has a right to expect other people to react a certain way to certain things. People in these comments clearly lack this basic understanding.\n\nJust like some people go batshit happy over every pregnancy in the family, some people have no emotional reaction to them. And some have a negative reaction.\nAnd they're all valid. \n\nTbh, the sister is the AH for expecting a special reaction, especially since she's offloading a shit ton of things onto OP.  And accepting money from them. Feels to me like she just wanted to make sure her sister piggybank will keep shelling out money and babysitter service. Feels to me, like she really wants the attention and care that comes with pregnancies, more than she wants ppl to be happy. \n\nY'all commenters would be well advised to maybe take a less emotional view on situations involving pregnancies (and in general) instead of going into blind baby fever.", "NTA my sister had twin girls when I was 13 and she told me first thing when I woke up so I said \"cool\"  then went back to sleep all my sister did was laugh. Then when I was 17 she got pregnant again and when she told me I smiled and said \"cool\" again. She and I were happy and excited but she didn't expect me to break into song and dance or anything.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m so sick of people telling other\u2019s how they\u2019re supposed to react. If you want a forced over the top reaction, imagine it in your head then since it\u2019s going to be fake anyway. \n\nWe don\u2019t all jump up and down and clap with tears in our eyes when we hear good news. For some of us \u2018cool, awesome\u2019 IS expressing enthusiasm.", "NTA. Let's normalize not being happy for people who can't fucking afford to take care of children getting pregnant. If you choose to have children knowing that you can't financially support them, you're a shitty parent. I'm so tired of this idea that you have to be so excited for someone every time they announce a pregnancy, even when it's your asshole friend/sister/whatever who keeps having kids and then dropping the responsibility on other people. You don't owe her a goddamn thing, you especially don't owe her any kind of excitement for her announcing she's having another kid you're going to have to support.", "NTA, for me personally I don't find stay at home moms with 5 kids to be very cool either. Like, cool, you managed to lay on your back 5 times with your partner, but considering you can't really take care of the 4 you already have, why need a 5th at this point?", "NTA my sister has 4, it was less and less exciting everytime. Hers are 21, 19, 14, 6. She didn't try for any of them either. I even cringe when people shake the blokes hand and go \"well done\".", "NTA.  Five kids is too many kids, especially if money is tight but even if it isn\u2019t. \n\nHer reaction to your reaction shows that at 38 she isn\u2019t mature enough to even have 1 let alone 5.   You\u2019re 18. Why would you be excited about an event that is now commonplace to you?", "Honey, you are so NTA. ESPECIALLY after your update. You need to have a frank discussion with your family about the fact that you\u2019re basically parent #3 to your nieces and it\u2019s unreasonable as \ud83e\udd2c to expect an 18yo to be excited over ANOTHER baby she\u2019s going to have to babysit and financially support. Your sister apparently has no appreciation for the sacrifices YOU\u2019VE made for her and, for your own sanity, you need to establish firm boundaries NOW.", "Right?? How do you get excited over the 5th baby? By the 5th I'm wondering if they know what birth control is.", "NTA, and it\u2019s time to wean her from your financial support.", "Imagine being so pressed that your little sister is not excited about your 5th pregnancy you make your whole family leave and act like a drama queen, OP is already being supportive and gives her money, your mood depends on how excited I am for your 5th child, how about she starts acting like a mother instead? NTA.", "FIVE kids. Why is everyone obligated to make such a huge deal about it time after time after time after time.", "Reading between the lines. Sounds like Op has resentfulness built up front having to subsidize her sisters life as a mom. Either by having to spend time babysitting or having to give money.", "Being a teenager isn\u2019t an excuse for being a dick though, you are allowed to make mistakes, doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t own up and apologise for them. Doesn\u2019t make you any less of an asshole. The point of posting this is to see whether you are the asshole or not and saying it\u2019s okay because you are a teenager defeats the purpose of this sub entirely.", "Damn you sound like you were an abnormally rude and sarcastic 18 year old then.

What took so long?", ">know what you meant but I just started laughing about it and kept coming back xD\n\nWell, to be fair, she really didn't deserve to get evicted over it, but I thought that would go without saying...

Who has their teenage sibling help pay for their kids\u2019 needs???", "According to OP's edit, they've been helping out with the kids financially and through babysitting \u2014 they're likely feeling like they're being dumped with another responsibility that they're going to be expected to shoulder. Of course, the solution to that is boundaries.", ">edit 2: i have been finically supporting her other kids giving her money and food constantly and babysitting her kids so she can go out every weekend to hang out with friends. I did not add it to my original post because that was not what i was focusing on, I wanted opinions on my reaction to the announcement not me finically supporting her kids. i could have added that but I did not to go over the character limit. that's why i made an update on my profile. sorry for the confusion\n\nHer edit explains her lack of excitement, I think. If they need money and food and babysitting, having another kid is irresponsible.", "Yeah, plus OP is already babysitting for free on the weekends, plus helping sis out with finances. I would have been far ruder about this than OP was. NTA OP.", "That\u2019s just it - they can\u2019t afford the 4 they already have.", "Are you expected out of obligation to come over to your friends house and change the ribbons on the printer, partition the computer hard drive, format the paper for her as a favor, and print and drive the manuscript to the publisher every time? If you did, I\u2019m sure you would be less enthusiastic over time.", "Idk. When you're helping to care for the children other people are having, it becomes less exciting. It just does.  Op is helping financially and helping by watching the children. She is 18, 20 years younger than her sister, I wouldn't expect her to jump up and down at the idea either. Op NTA.", "She was probably just thinking about the extra babysitting they will ask of her and whatever extra money they would need. It's weirder for a 38 year old to ask their teenage sister for money AND free babysitting. Hard to be excited about that.", "Right? Hopefully OP let's them know they should find another sitter. 5 kids is a lot to handle especially for free and often. I pay my children to babysit their siblings. It isn't their responsible to care for other's choices to have children. Plus sounds like OP contributes to cover expenses. I wouldn't be thrilled to learn sister would be needing more resources when they can't afford the load they have now. \n\nThere was recently a clip going around of a grandma who was not excited about the news of another child's arrive. They were shaming the grandma about her response of \"really? Another one\". Turns of Grandma was financing the children they already had. She was not excited to be forced into financial responsibility once again for a child they couldn't afford.", "Maybe I\u2019m just being stupid but personally I don\u2019t think she was being impolite. I wouldn\u2019t really care after the 4th child either like the OP said it wasn\u2019t like a struggle to get the 5th one. It\u2019s not like they were expecting, I can\u2019t be expected to be excited for something that wasn\u2019t expected or like planned for.

My dad is a girl dad. He got two daughters. Both pregnancies were super hard on my mom (c sections for both my sister, b. 1975, and me, b. 1983). After me, the doctor advised my mom not to have anymore kids, which was fine with them. My dad cared more about my mom living than \u201ctrying for that boy\u201d.
