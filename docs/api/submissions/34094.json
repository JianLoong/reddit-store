This was a relatively big purchase for me, as my family normally hand-makes gifts and cards or focuses on smaller, more personal items for holidays and birthdays. My girlfriend\u2019s family is the opposite, and appreciates more expensive gifts, and she has gotten me very nice things in the past. Because of this, I decided to spend a bit more than I normally would to buy her the Kindle she\u2019s been mentioning. \n\nIt came a few days ago, and when I received it, curiosity and excitement got the better of me, and I took the package out of the Amazon box it came in. I broke the seal of the box the device came in and pulled the Kindle out, still in its plastic wrap. I looked at it to make sure it was what I ordered and almost unwrapped it, but eventually decided to stop messing with her gift and put everything back the best I could. \n\nI ended up mentioning to my girlfriend that I had bought her a Kindle a few days before I was planning to give it to her (this is the nature of our relationship; normally I\u2019d try to keep it a surprise), and she asked if I had opened the box. I told her yes, I had opened the Amazon box and the box it came in, but left the actual gift in its plastic wrap. She got angry with me and told me I might as well return it because I had essentially opened her gift for her. I asked her to confirm that she wanted me to return the expensive gift I got her because I had messed with the packaging, and she said yes; in her family everything was left exactly how it was before it was opened by the recipient. I told her I wouldn\u2019t mind or notice if someone opened the packaging for me because the gift itself is what matters, and she told me I wasn\u2019t listening to her side, and that I should return it or give it to my sister who is an avid reader.
