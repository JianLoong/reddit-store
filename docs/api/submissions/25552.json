When we got to my apartment I quickly went to the bathroom and told Alice to make herself at home. Suddenly, maybe 10 min later, she started acting really weird. Like, she was slurring her words in an excessive way and seemed to be completely spaced out. I was incredibly confused because she had barely drank when we were out, and now she was out of it.\n\nMy first thought was that she could have been drugged at the bar we just were at. Whilst trying to figure out WTF I'm supposed to do - she asked me what flavor my vape was, which confused me because I do not vape, nor do I smoke. I asked her what she meant, and she pointed at a vape on my bookshelf. That's when everything clicked.\n\nFor my 20th birthday a friend (20m) had bought me a THC vape. My gift would be tickets to watch the new Spider-Man movie high. I am not a stoner, but I maybe once or twice a year smoke with friends just for fun. Anyway, I hadn\u2019t smoked it since then, so it was just lying on the top of my bookshelf. I am short, so I never see it - hence me suppressing its existence. Alice, however, is very tall. She must have been looking around whilst I was in the bathroom, seen the vape (which looks very unassuming, like any vape) and taken some puffs. Mind you, I do not know what the fuck type of vape this is because I remember taking max two puffs and I had a complete out-of-body experience, and I don't even know how many puffs she took - she is an avid vaper.\n\nI asked her if she had smoked that vape, and she said yes. Now, Alice is extremely anti drugs. Her father was a heroin addict, so she never did anything except drink alcohol. I always had a total understanding and full respect to her disposition to drugs - so i NEVER, EVER did drugs in front of her (I have only ever smoked weed & did the occasional molly festivals, as you do lol)She completely (understandably) freaked out and started crying. I tried calming her as much as I could, I tried giving her food and water or ANYTHING to sober her up, but she screamed at me that I had drugged her. She said she couldn't believe I had done this to her etc. I had to call her boyfriend and explain the situation, and he picked her up.\n\nI feel fucking awful. My stomach drops even thinking about it. If I had remembered the vape of course I would have stashed it away more safely! But, I hadn\u2019t planned on her coming over until we went to my place and by the point we were home I was tipsy, and the thought didn't even cross my mind, just as it hadn\u2019t since I had put it on the shelf! As soon as she left I sent a huge apology text to her, but she left me to read. I get it.\n\nShe has since blocked me everywhere and shunned me to all our mutual friends, who are all torn on the issue. I have barely slept since, I can't eat, I feel so bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693063456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161y30l/aita_for_accidentally_getting_my_friend_high/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It feels like a bit or something.", "NTA.  She accidentally drugged herself.  Plus, it\u2019s just cannabis.  Alcohol is definitely a harder drug.", "NTA, she touched your property without permission.", "NTA Also your title is very misleading, you did not get her high, she got herself high by not asking what something was before putting it in her body and disrespecting you and your things without asking for permission.

She took your vape pen and used it without asking, that's on her. And if she vapes, I assume nicotine products, regularly she should've noticed the taste was off after the first pull. She should've stopped and considered why. Also idk your relationship with this friend but I feel like that's gross. Unless I directly offer to share something that has been in/on/near my mouth then hands off. Like tf? I have no problem sharing things with people like \"hey take do you want to try my drink?\" But I'm not making that offer to everyone and unless I offer don't put your germs on my stuff.", "Your friend is an idiot and your NTA.

She\u2019s blaming you for her poor decision. This is completely on her, not you.", "Ofc you're NTA.  It was an accident on your part and shame on her for just casually picking up and using someone else's stuff.

Honestly I don\u2019t care how good a friend I am with someone, I\u2019m not going into their space and just smoking a random vape that I see lying around without asking for the persons okay. She could have saved herself the trouble if she had just talked to you before smoking it. \n\nSecond, alcohol is a drug, it\u2019s a legal drug to those of age but still a drug nonetheless, I understand her reasoning for how she feels about drugs, my high school boyfriend was straight edge when we were together bc of the fact that his bio dad was a major burnout.

She has to be hiding some type of addiction and is ashamed of herself and projected onto you, that\u2019s the only way I could realistically see why she got mad at you.", "NTA - You didn't accidently get her high. She accidentally got herself high. You don't smoke, your friend should know that. Why would she assume the vape in your home has nicotine when you're not a smoker? She should have, at the very least, asked to use it. Seriously, you're not even a little bit in the wrong here.", "She should not have picked up the vape without asking you first.  Whether or not she gets over this or not, this is between you and her, and what she is doing is trying to force friends to take sides, which is not a good look.  Some will understand you and others her, but if she keeps this up, she may lose friends.", "Absolutely NTA. Who goes to someone's house and just takes what they want without asking?  She did that to herself, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA!  Not even a little bit! Stop feeling guilty. Don't let your 'friend' guilt trip you. She's gotta get over it. Just wondering if she is often a drama queen and into emotional blackmail? If so this could be you dodging a bullet. Don't grovel for her forgiveness. It was an honest mistake absolutely NOT your fault. You guys are young and should be laughing about this. On another note... She's anti drugs but still drinks alcohol? Alcohol is one of the most addictive drugs you can get involved in. I'm a recovering alcoholic and seen plenty of evidence of it's destructive power. Its on another level to cannabis and its derivatives.", "How is It ur fault if she took ur vape and smoked it? She was snooping around and grabbed something thay wasn't hers so nta", "NTA.

And this was hilarious btw \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlice doesn't know it yet, but she did you a favor. She sounds like an entitled person with a victim mentality and no respect for boundaries.\n\nDon't feel bad OP. You did nothing wrong.

If she's so anti-drug why the hell did she smoke a random vape she found? It's not adding up to me.", "NTA. She fucking used a vape that was not hers to use and blames you?

Socially acceptable maybe, but still drugs. Then she's entitled, who the heck uses someone's cake without asking. Lastly she's an asshole for trying to shift blame to you. It's not your job to give drugs around her, it's her job not to touch stuff that ain't hers without asking. Make yourself at home does not mean \"by all means use my vape and go watch porn on my pc.\". She didn't do that second thing, but it falls into the same category for me.
