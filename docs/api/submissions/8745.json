They wanted a piece, you guys agreed to a price / time frame, you upheld your end of a bargain - they did not. No money, no artwork.\n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for charging money in the first place. Friends and family need to stop feeling entitled to freebies. Hairstylist? Free haircut. Tattoo artist? Free tattoo. Photographer? Free photos. Artist? Free artwork. If your friend wasn\u2019t an artist and they wanted that artwork they\u2019d have to pay for it. You shouldn\u2019t expect because you know someone they should give you their time / sources for free. If they just gave away free services to all friends / family that\u2019d cut into a chunk of their income and take away time from actual paying clients.", "NTA. This is your livelihood. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with your friends, but they\u2019re ridiculous if they think you should give away art you made for nothing. If they wanna help your friend have the art,  they should pitch in and pay for it.", "Of course you're NTA. If your friend were in a store and said \"I can't afford what I'm holding, but can I take it anyway?\", would you expect the store to give it to her? \n\nYou deserve to be compensated for your work. You do not deserve to work for free. In future, take a sizeable deposit for all commissions.", "Lol NTA\n\nYour friends do a lot of labor for free? They can shove it.", "NTA, you did a service and produced goods for her. You get money in return that's the whole deal. If she can't afford it now that's fine. She's clearly a vindictive jerk. I would find new friends OP.", "NTA\n\nYou had an agreement. You would do the art she requested, and she would pay you. One of you backed out, therefore the transaction is void. She doesn't get art for free. If your \"friend\" walks into a department store and want a sweater or something, can she tell the cashier she's having a hard time financially so they should give it to her for free? Girl would be laughed out of the store at best. No money, no product. Period.", "NTA\n\nYour \"friends\" are though. If she can't afford the painting, she can't have it. Do your other friends always work for free? Cause that's what they're asking you to do.", "NTA, and the title is misleading, that's not what happened.\n\nYou two agreed, she then gives and excuse that might not be real, as if expecting for you to give it to her anyways, her plan didn't work so she puts everyone against you.\n\nI would keep the painting, because of her behavior behind your back.\n\nAs for the 'friends', if they're so convinced you should give her the painting, why don't they put some money together to buy it from you? Like looking for a solution, instead of pinning you as the villain in the story.", "NTA.\n\nClearly, your friend liked your art enough to want some, but plainly non of your friends consider what you do a \"real job\" hence the disrespect.", "NTA obviously but your friends are.  If she put in a cake order at the grocery, then showed up at the store without money, think they would just say okay and hand her the cake?", "NTA. She reneged on your agreement. You don't work for free. If she can't afford the price you agreed on, she doesn't get the painting.

She agreed to the price\n\nYou're not an AH, they agreed to the price that they were quoted before you even started the commission. She tells you two weeks later that she can no longer afford the set price, but still expects you to give it to her for free. You are absolutely not an AH for asking for money for your time, work and supplies. People always want free artwork and they don't stop to think about how an artist needs money for the supplies and time that they put into a piece. I really hope you didn't give it to her for free because of what your \"friends\" are saying. A real friend would understand that you're a full time artist and that this is your job not a hobby.", "nta. but that's why you have a written contract and get a deposit up front. Even with friends. and now you see you. live and learn.", "NTA. always get a deposit (30% at least) and the person does not get the art until they pay.  If they don\u2019t pay in time tell them they have 30 days or you keep the art AND the deposit. \n\nIn some cases (if the art is something you can sell) and they make it clear they can\u2019t pay you can refund some of the deposit.", "NTA. 1. Your \u201cfriend\u201d isn\u2019t a friend, she\u2019s a user. 2.  You had, at the least, a verbal agreement/contract and she didn\u2019t honor it, you can\u2019t be expected to work for free. 3.  I hope that you told your \u201cfriends\u201d what actually transpired. 4.  Are they really friends if they automatically took her side without giving you the opportunity to tell your side, before making a judgement.  5. Get some new friends. 6.  Always have written and signed agreement before starting on a commission piece.", "Okay guys, I just want to say a couple things. 1. Thank you so much for all the support, 2. usually I do charge 50% before work, however this was a friend and kept assuring me that they will give me the money. Yes I am stupid for trusting them", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that your friends are treating you that way. You really should find new ones.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou agreed on a price, you agreed on a timeline, you held up your end, they did not. I can't go to a mechanic and say \"Yeah, fix it.\" then drive off without paying. It's a simple concept.", "NTA I build you a house, you don\u2019t pay but still expect to move in on time. Hell no. You sell that art to somebody else.", "NTA. Her financial hardships are not your problem. She should have never commissioned you if she couldn\u2019t afford it.

Do not give her the painting.  Block the people who are ragging on you.  Best outcome is you being able to sell it.

If your \u201cfriends\u201d are fully aware of the situation and *still* taking her side, please find new friends. Your time and skill are worthwhile and caving here would set a terrible precedent.

How could any human be on her side", "NTA, but this is why you take a deposit on all commissions before picking up your brush/stylus/pencil. Give discounts to friends, sure but don't change prudent business policies just because someone is a friend. Friends support friend's businesses.\n\nAlso anyone who says an artist shouldn't be compensated for their time is an AH. \n\nI'd clear the air with your friends and state clearly that your \"friend\" agreed to pay for a custom drawing and refused to pay, that when you receive payment she will get her commissioned art as you both agreed. \n\nI'm not really sure how you can remain friends with people who remain on her side after they know that information.", "This. Find a different friend group. If they don't respect your work, your right to get paid for the time and effort and talent you put in -- especially when it's already been explicitly promised -- these are not people who care about you or will have your back about anything else.\n\nBy the way: don't ever again begin a commission piece without having 50% of the total price in hand. You shouldn't be starting anything for anyone unless they've paid you half up front, friend or no.", "I guess I got very lucky in my friends and family. I'm a massage therapist, and the only people I know who ever asked for a free massage are my minor children. And since I pay for their needs anyway, it would've been kind of silly for them to try to pay me for my work. They get massage if they ask nicely and I feel like giving it.", "Actually, that's not the whole deal, because OP accidentally put themself in a bad position that doesn't serve any good professional artist to let happen. They shouldn't have picked up tools to do the first line of the commission until they had half the total payment already paid and in the bank. \n\nThat's standard -- 50% up front before the work begins, and then the other 50% on delivery. That prevents them from being scammed by assholes like that \"friend,\" and ensures that at worst, they'll get half their pay even if someone tries to stiff them on the rest. And folks are much less likely to try to stiff them on the rest if they've already got half their money. \n\nOP should have a contract that every client signs before work begins, that lays out the terms: 50% up front, 50% at the time of delivery, and if the second 50% isn't paid, the work will not be handed over and the first 50% is forfeit, to pay for the time they had to put into it. \n\nSome people add that, if the second half is not paid, the artist *also*, in addition to keeping the first half, has the right to do whatever they want with the finished artwork, but that depends a lot on what kind of art they're doing. Obviously imaginary landscape are a bit different from personal portraits of the client.", "But was this over text or anything? Don't you have literal proof of that promise?", "usually I do, but I thought I could trust her, clearly not", "Yeah, I may not have a trade / hobby / business, but I\u2019ve never expected anything for free from friends/family who do. My best friend was a hair stylist for over a decade and I always paid the same price as everyone, and tipping her on top of that like I would\u2019ve any other hair stylist. \n\nIt\u2019s cool when friends/family offer freebies or discounts, but it shouldn\u2019t be expected or an entitlement. Nothing bothers me more than the people actually upset that people won\u2019t give them their services for free especially when it comes to birthdays / weddings / etc. Things that you\u2019d spend hundreds to thousands on normally, but expecting your friend to front for free (on top of their time). \n\nGotta save the potential of future carpal tunnel for paying clients! (Kidding)", "my mum very kindly does mine and my siblings hair for cheap (she\u2019s a retired hairdresser), we just pay for supplies like hair dye if she doesn\u2019t have it in stock. offered to pay her several times but she calls me silly haha. \n\nshe does it whenever she has the time and energy and we never pester her cuz we understand that she\u2019s doing us a massive favour and saving us loads of money (me and my sister dye our hair blonde, so she\u2019s saving us about \u00a3100/\u00a3150 every 2/3 months) but we\u2019d completely understand if she wanted us to start paying her!", " It\u2019s not about proof, it\u2019s that everyone thinks I should just give it to her and expect the money at a later time.", "Yeah, sadly this has happened to most of my artist friends at some point (myself included). Being lenient on the deposit because we trust someone. Live and learn, and hopefully you'll find some awesome new friends who value and support your work!!", "I see. But even then, she should've communicated that at the time of the commission. Or at least while you were working or something.", "$300 for an art piece is already way too little... i work in videography... i don't get up fro $300... and you get paid before deliverables are due except if it's a corporate client that you invoice..."]}
