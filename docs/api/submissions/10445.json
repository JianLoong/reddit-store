I guess I personally would rather a round trip of an hour for me vs making my friends drive 2 full hours. And yeah it sucks when everyone doesn't live right close. I have to deal with that often. \n\nIf it was a huge party I would be more okay with it. Like a party of 100 people and one lives so far out. Okay. But this is a really small group and I'd have a hard time doing that.", "Haha yup that's Perth for you", "Oh, I didn't notice that part sorry(not English native so some things pass unnoticed), even so, OP tried his best to choose a place more central to everyone if it was me, I would go without fussing, sometimes I have to, and I live in a small country, for friendship sometimes we must make \"sacrifices\", not that I think it's a sacrifice to go out with my friends, but maybe A is not a big friend.

This isn't a party for him, it's for your wife. He needs to get ober himself. Withdraw the invitation because he clearly doesn't want to come but he wants to blame you for it.", "Agreed.

Just being nosy NTA", "No! Everyone else will have increased gas cost and they'll probably lose several other invitees who won't want to travel that far.\n\nWhen you're accommodating a group of people, you have to settle for doing the best you can for the majority.\n\nThis invitation should have been delivered to Mike with the disclaimer: \"We'd love to see you, but I understand this is a distance from you, and understand if you don't want to drive that far.

I can't believe he literally said that!!", "NTA. If an extra 15 mins isn\u2019t a big deal, then tell him he can drive the extra mileage.
