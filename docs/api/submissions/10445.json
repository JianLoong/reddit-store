How entitled is this friend? Apparently you are not Americans, Canadians or Australians. For them a 1-hour drive would be nothing. I myself live in tiny Netherlands, and even I am not much bothered by a 1-hour drive.", "NTA, in my opinion, you were very considerate, thinking of a place central for everyone, if that one friend is saying it's inconsiderate just because he doesn't want to drive 15min, and wants it to be near him and he doesn't give a s*** to the other people going, then he is TA", "NTA\n\nThe adult way to handle this is politely declining and maybe sending a gift. An hour is a bit of a drive, so it\u2019s understandable he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. But demanding that you change the venue is incredibly self centered of him.", "> He messaged me in private and asked me to change the venue\n\nWhy don't you tell him he's free to ask the group in the group chat? If the six friends are willing to change the venue and drive further so that one participant has an easier time, then they can.\n\nBut he can ask.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHe's a pain in the arse.", "NTA\n\nDude sounds like he needs to tone down the ego a bit. Ask him if he prefers it to be held at his house and if he needs a lift from work", "NTA \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t want to drive then he has the option of not going", "NTA. It makes no sense to inconvenience the majority of the group. I\u2019m sure if you lived Farr from everyone else you would be the one driving for longer. Your friend is entitled.", "NTA. He chose to live further away. That\u2019s not something that you need to account for. It\u2019s his loss if they aren\u2019t willing to drive to an event that you graciously invited them to.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your party for your wife and you can have it wherever you want,  he\u2019s being unreasonable.", "ESH. Making it so part of the group has a 15-20 minute drive and part has an hour when there's locations that make it about equal is kinda rude. Especially since at night and they'll have another hour to drive after. 30 minute drive vs 2 hours total drive is a lot. \n\nAnd they should have just declined after the initial ask. \n\nDoesn't sound like either of you are great friends to one another.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You set the plans and he can just say he\u2019s not going if it\u2019s such a big deal for him.", "NTA - A is only thinking about himself , you dont have the obligation to change the venue", "NTA. It\u2019s not his party, it\u2019s for your wife. As a guest, he doesn\u2019t have a say in the venue. You went out of your way to find a centralized location for a majority of the invited guests. The audacity of this guy is mind blowing. My best friend lives an hour away from me but when my husband threw me a surprise birthday party in our hometown, guess what she did? She drove the hour to be with me because it was important to her.", "NTA.  I mean, naturally you\u2019re going to host an event for you and your girlfriend at your preferred venue, in terms of location and ambience etc.   It just so happens it\u2019s father for one set of people.  Thems the breaks\u2026to expect and insist you to CHANGE it for them is unreasonable.", "NTA it\u2019s not their party, it\u2019s yours so it seems pretty rude for them to ask for a venue change.", "NTA\n\n\n\nIt's your wife's birthday....not his. He doesn't get to control what goes on for HER party. Whoever told you to ask the group chat is awful advice. This isn't a group decision. \n\nHe can get a hotel if he's worried about the drive back or stay home. Pretty simple.", "Nta, he's got a lot of balls! If he wants to plan an outing closer to his home he's welcome to do so, and if the plans YOU made for your WIFE'S birthday are too far of a drive for him he's welcome to decline.", "NTA, unless A is offering to pay for everyone else\u2019s Uber?\n\nFrom what you said, it\u2019s not just about distance, but you also don\u2019t like the venue near A - and that\u2019s fair - you organised the party, you choose the venue. Unless you were organising an event for A, in which case, hopefully it would be about A\u2019s wants.\n\nAlso, if there is that distance, that\u2019s just part of life and people living different places. If you care for someone, you try to make an effort to show up for them (and it doesn\u2019t always work out, but you try). It sucks, but\u2026 adulthood.", "NTA it your party that you are planning, of course you are choosing what is most convenient for you & the majority of the guests. Tell him he is welcome to plan another get to get together that he can host closer to his home, but you will not be inconveniencing everyone else.", "NTA in a group that lives spread out someone is going to habve a longer drive. If A doesn't want to drive 1 hour then he does not need to come. Asking you to change the wole party for his convenience is rude. An hour isn't super far to drive.\n\nIt is  your wife's birthday. Is she going to be upset if A is not there? If not then no need to change anything. Just say sorry you can't make it this time.", "NTA\n\nWhy is his \"comfort\" more important than everyone else's?\n\nTell him you'll agree to it only if he asks the group and everyone else agrees.", "NTA.\n\nAs an aside, I really really hope your wife actually likes bowling because otherwise... \ud83d\ude2c", "And if that's the case, it's the worst excuse too. Like \"it's far for me and wife to drive, so change the venue so it's far for the other five/six people instead\" lmao.\n\nNTA, an hour drive is not that bad, it's rare I hear people be that uptight about driving an hour.\n\n(I understand gas prices, but not good enough excuse for me on this one).", "Cheers and thanks!", "This, if he wants it near him he has to pay for it \u263a\ufe0f done", "We're in Australia actually lol. I'm not a huge fan of driving either, but I agree 1 hour drives are pretty standard here", "Thanks. I honestly would have been disappointed, but ultimately okay if he had done that", "OP said it was a 15to 20min drive, not one hour, so it's not a big drive", "Yeah that's good advice. Wish I'd thought of it earlier. It's now gotten to a point where we're both annoyed with each other and don't think he'd be willing to do it now.", "I think you misread my post. I said it would be an EXTRA 15 min drive for everyone else (on top of 15-20 mins for the other place)\nBut if you still feel esh fair enough", "I have a friend living in Perth. I live in europe and i was telling her that i would go to another country by car and that it would take me like 10 hours to get there. She said that if she would want to leave from Perth and would drive for 10 h, then she would be 10h away from perth and nowhere near any destination.", "15 to 20 for everyone else, it\u2019s an hour for the friend in the story", "So an extra 30 minutes driving for y'all. I guess I personally would rather a round trip of an hour for me vs making my friends drive 2 full hours. And yeah it sucks when everyone doesn't live right close. I have to deal with that often. \n\nIf it was a huge party I would be more okay with it. Like a party of 100 people and one lives so far out. Okay. But this is a really small group and I'd have a hard time doing that.", "Haha yup that's Perth for you", "Oh, I didn't notice that part sorry(not English native so some things pass unnoticed), even so, OP tried his best to choose a place more central to everyone if it was me, I would go without fussing, sometimes I have to, and I live in a small country, for friendship sometimes we must make \"sacrifices\", not that I think it's a sacrifice to go out with my friends, but maybe A is not a big friend. Not to mention it's OP's SO's birthday party, so I believe OP is doing this in a place his SO loves to go, the only person who can say no to that place is OP's SO", "You don't force the majority of people to drive 30 minutes more just to please 2 people who choose to live far away from the rest.", "It's 1/4th of the group. That's quite a bit. Making a more central location for the whole group...is way more polite.", "NTA - If the \u201cfriend\u201d doesn\u2019t want to drive that far that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t expect the party to be moved to accommodate you. Politely decline that you can\u2019t make it.  I would not make any effort to accommodate this self entitled person.", "NTA.  You don't get to change the location of a party you're invited to.  Don't wanna drive that far, don't come.  Full stop.", "NTA, it's an unwritten rule that if out of 10 people, 8 of them are more nearby and 2 are further away, you have it closer to the host and 8 other people and the other 2 travel a little further. Majority rules", "NTA - you sent an invite for the party, not a \u201cwhat do you think about the location?\u201d An hour for a friends party is nothing.", "NTA", "NTA A is making this about him and his wife. it\u2019s your wife\u2019s birthday, not his. if he wants a venue closer to his house then he should wait until his birthday, otherwise if it\u2019s too far for him then he shouldn\u2019t come.", "NTA\nWho does A think he is? This isn't a party for him, it's for your wife. He needs to get ober himself. Withdraw the invitation because he clearly doesn't want to come but he wants to blame you for it.", "Agreed. I have driven further for friends (birthday or not). If you want to see them you put an effort in coming. Even if it is an hour drive.", "Where are you.  In the IS an hour is nothing to drive. Just being nosy NTA", "No! Everyone else will have increased gas cost and they'll probably lose several other invitees who won't want to travel that far.\n\nWhen you're accommodating a group of people, you have to settle for doing the best you can for the majority.\n\nThis invitation should have been delivered to Mike with the disclaimer: \"We'd love to see you, but I understand this is a distance from you, and understand if you don't want to drive that far. If you can't make it we'll just make another plan to catch up later.\"\n\nNTA", "I disagree. Asking in the group chat ends with some people saying it\u2019s fine and pressuring others to agree when it\u2019s not fine with them, and lots of resentment on all sides. Your party, your preferences, your rules. Don\u2019t drag anyone else into this abyss."]}
