I guess she used to do lots of jazz/hip-hop classe and taught some to kids before, but she\u2019s never been a professional. My daughter is in 4th grade and has been telling me about her \u201cdance club\u201d she does every Friday at lunch. \n\nLast week I was in the school to drop something off at lunch on Monday and I went by the gym and saw that there were kids dancing. I looked and my daughter wasn\u2019t in there but about 12 kids (mostly girls) were doing a routine that honestly looked pretty complicated and really good. \n\nI asked my daughter why she wasn\u2019t dancing that day later at home and she said it wasn\u2019t \u201cher day.\u201d Apparently this teacher has segregated the kids into three groups based on how good they are at dancing and how well they can learn the routines. Monday and Wednesday are basically \u201cinvite only\u201d for kids who are \u201cbetter\u201d at dancing, and Friday is for anyone who want to come.\n\nMy daughter says she really likes Fridays and it\u2019s fun, and that if she wants to join the other days she has to show the teacher that she can do the moves and learn the routines. Im glad she\u2019s having fun but honestly this seems completely elitist and not okay. Most of the kids in the Monday and Wednesday groups are in dance classes out of school so it\u2019s basically just a reward for kids whose parents out them in activities. Also how is a beginner like my daughter supposed to learn if she can\u2019t try the harder moves?\n\nI went on the PTA Mom Facebook group and brought it up. I\u2019m think it\u2019s a great opportunity for the kids but I hate seeing kids get isolated like that. A big discussion started and someone tagged the teacher. There ended up being some comments that I think were a little overboard. \n\nThe teacher ended up responding saying, \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s just take a break from dance club then.\u201d \n\nBy the end of the week my daughter was upset and told dance club was cancelled. \n\nI think I could be TA because I started the conversation, but really I think it was unfair.

It's skill based with different opportunities based on skill", "YTA. \n\n1) Your daughter didn't have a problem with it- you projected your own insecurities about elitism, inserted yourself into her school world and  stirred up trouble.\n\n\n2) Most sports, cheer and dance clubs use a skills based approach to structuring groups. It lets kids who play/dance/sing at an expert level and kids who are new all participate and gives kids goals to work up to.", "Yes, YTA. Ruin it for everyone by attempting to bully a teacher (who is already overworked, underpaid, and doing something extra out of her time for these kids) into accommodating your kid, who didn\u2019t ask you to do any of this and was completely fine and understanding of the situation. Congratulations. What a lesson to teach your daughter. It\u2019s a good thing she is already displaying more maturity than you.", "YTA\n\nAre you going to insist your kid gets to be a starter in the football team too, no matter how good or bad they are?  I mean, otherwise it'd just be *unfair*, right?", "YTA. You ruined it for all the kids and ruined your daughters fun. Your daughter isn't at the same dance level. Get over it or get her additional lessons. Don't be \"that parent\"", "You are most definitely TA.  Let your child grow up in the real world.  Let her choose her own battles.  Let HER tell YOU when she needs help. You just sabotaged her fun and her happiness.  Congratulations", "YTA, you should have talked to the teacher directly about your questions and concerns. You should have paid attention to how happy and motivated your child was to learn more.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter was having fun and enjoying her time on Fridays. Even seems like she welcomed the challenge of having to work hard to get invited to the other days. And you robbed her of that, why...?\n\n You're more upset by this situation than she ever was (before you imposed your feelings onto her). \n\nIf you want your daughter to dance more often and/or be better at it, feel free to pay for classes at a dance school. Otherwise, just be happy that your daughter is happy and accept a free dance club from a teacher that can easily do a hundred other things with her spare time.", "YTA\n\nSo this teacher is running extra-curricular, fun, arts-based, physical education activities three lunches a week? Do you realize that means she\u2019s donating her lunch period? \n\nAnd you\u2019re upset that she\u2019s split the kids up according to ability levels? That\u2019s how these things work! If a 10 year old is a raw beginner they\u2019re going to drown trying to learn something meant for kids who\u2019ve been dancing since age 3. And the more advanced kids might have fun doing more basic things, but they\u2019ll get bored. \n\nThe system this teacher has set up honestly sounds good, and it sounds like kids can move up if they challenge themselves and grow. \n\nTaking this to a PTA Facebook group immediate is why you\u2019re T A though. Teacher has enough crap on her plate and was trying to do something good for the school. She probably looked forward to it and you provoked and entitled internet pile-on.", "Am I understanding it right that there were two different classes?\n\nOne for the beginners and those who aren't as adept and another for those who can and have more practice?\n\nThat sounds fairly normal (just like 5th grade math, though you can test out and do 6th grade math if you're that good) to me, but I'm no parent.", "Massive YTA and the fact that you don't see that is honestly even worse.", "YTA.  The teacher was volunteering to teach something she enjoyed.  You tried to make it about your daughter only.  Now none of the kids are having fun and it's your fault.\n\nPeople like you are why we can't have nice things", "Why did the teacher break up the kids into different groups? Were there kids with more experience who were feeling they wanted more of a challenge? Were some of the children new to the experience feeling discouraged being with advanced dancers? Maybe the teacher was trying to break the kids into smaller groups because it was so popular and she was trying to accommodate everyone?\n\nIt sounds like you never asked the teacher those questions. You went online and complained to other parents instead. The end result was the teacher who did this in her own limited free time stopped the classes. I don't blame her.\n\nI'm sure the teacher wasn't trying to be elitist. She was probably trying to figure out how to manage things. Your talking to her one on one might have allowed a different perspective for her (or you). You could have used this as a great teaching moment for your daughter. Encouraged her to practice at home and move into the other classes. What a feeling of accomplishment!\n\nInstead, YTA for not talking to the teacher and getting the entire free dance experience cancelled without trying to fix it first. You didn't hurt the children who take outside dance lessons. You only hurt the children who either can't take lessons or who have never been exposed to dance at all.", "YTA. there are a ton of ways you could have helped or encouraged your daughter to practice at home without spending money. You didn't have to strong-arm the teacher into changing her rules. \n\nThis was a club that the teacher ran multiple days a week during what would be her free time for no extra pay. Please consider how lucky your daughter was to have that at all to start with. Teachers are grossly underpaid, and the arts are critically underfunded. That club was a *gift.*", "YTA for so many reasons. So you\u2019re suggesting the teacher should lump all the kids together and the ones who can\u2019t keep up with the best dancers, who get outside classes - should be allowed to fall behind, feel miserable about themselves, lose interest in dancing, get less physical activity and have their self esteem destroyed. Brilliant plan, you AH!", "I took dance classes for my entire childhood and it\u2019s normal to have separate classes for different skill levels . YTA and you sound entitled . You have no idea how the dance industry works at all", "JFC. You have a volunteer who is making school better for everyone, including your daughter, and you fucking ruined it.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, it's like you woud be angry that your kid is not is advanced math class because she didn't finished her basic course yet. You are ruining fun for everyone.", "YTA. It\u2019s very normal to break groups down into manageable class sizes, and also very normal to split students by skill. Obviously you didn\u2019t know anything, didn\u2019t bother checking in with the teacher, couldn\u2019t be arsed to help your daughter practise or get her coaching, and now want to cause trouble for the teacher all because she was doing something nice for the kids.", "So to you, \"fair\" means that the kids who are better at dancing should not get to learn as much because of the students who aren't as good? Are you going to complain about varsity and junior varsity too?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. This teacher is probably trying to give students an outlet and something positive and fun to do to prevent behaviors popping up during lunch and/or recess. At both of the schools I\u2019ve worked at, behaviors are out of control during lunch and recess. This teacher is likely volunteering her own lunch time three times a week to teach students how to dance. \nLunch is often the only \u201cbreak\u201d elementary teachers get (at least in the states without unions). The volunteering this teacher was doing was providing a great outlet and you ruined it for everyone.", "YTA giving kids a goal to strive towards is GOOD.  \n\nNo one gets on the swim team or the track team or the gym team or the cheerleading team if they don\u2019t qualify.  The urge to try hard in order to qualify is a huge motivating factor.\n\nThe teacher was still giving everyone an opportunity to learn and Improve in order to qualify for the special team.\n\nThis woman was giving up get own personal lunch time to do something fantastic for the kids.  None of the kids had a problem with it.\n\nIt was just YOU who couldn\u2019t handle the fact that your precious darling wasn\u2019t the bestest most special princess.\n\nParents like you are why all the good teachers are quitting and only the horrible ones are staying.", "YTA, seems like a sensible way to teach a large group of interested children.\n\nPersonally if I was a beginner and I was in a dance class with very talented dancers I'd probably give up because I'd feel like I wasn't good enough. \nWhy do you think they have advanced classes in school?

Once they get better, maybe they can go toe-to-toe with the other group and there will no longer be any segregation.\n\nAlso, am I right in assuming that this is not something the teacher is paid to do?", "INFO:\n\nDefine \"overboard\"?

If she wants to run her own dance club, to complete, or whatever, she needs to do that outside of the school.", "i think most of these are fake", "Lol they removed it but the moderator comment is still there with the whole thing \ud83e\udd2d", "Y\u2019all let\u2019s report and get these fake losers bands (the OPs that make fake posts) and waste all the time these \u201cDiscord mods\u201d spent farming likes on Reddit", "This needs more up votes", "She sounds like one of those parents that thinks all kids should get participation trophies.\n\nIt seems like the teacher was trying to crate a fun activity for students. It seemed like a lot of students with varying levels of dance skills wanted to participate but that\u2019s not how you teach nor train. It\u2019s no different than trying out for the cheerleading team.\n\nYTA", "There are three groups. The Friday group is what my daughter dances in, and it\u2019s also open to new people who want to join in. I think some of the kids from the other two groups come on Friday and help the teacher.", "I wonder what the odds are OP\u2019s takeaway would be that her good deed of trying to Harrison Bergeron the dance class was punished by the mean teacher canceling the classes.", "YTA. How do you not understand that many things like dance classes, sports, etc. are structured similarly? You decided to bully someone despite the fact that your daughter is having fun with the friday group.", "Exactly! OP knows nothing about dance or apparently sports in general. Of course the beginners are with the beginners!! How else would this be structured?", "It's even worse than that because it's participation award vibes without even understanding that all the kids got equal participation. Each kid got 1 day a week. Just different days were for different kids. No one got more time than OPs kid, and she still made a huge stink about it. OP YTA big time.", "I dont know if she is paid to do it, but it\u2019s during the school day so I would assume so. My daughter said the first \u201cmeeting\u201d was for everyone who was interested. Everyone tried to learn a dance with the teacher, and talked about how much dancing they had done. She said the teacher told them the group was too big to have everyone dance at the same time, so she would make three groups.", "She told the kids that there were too many interested kids (I think more than 50) to have everyone dance together, so they would do smaller groups. She also said this was a better way to learn how to dance but I don\u2019t know.", "From OP\u2019s clarifications though it really looks like it WAS inclusive. They had a really big group that was split into three smaller groups by ability level. All the kids look like they\u2019re getting equal time, but they can actually learn  and have fun.", "It's inclusive to me. But you cannot put level 1 into the same same as level 10. Of course there will be advanced classes for more skillful and diligent students.", "I feel bad for when you learn about drama club...", "Do you object to the idea of kids making/not making a basketball team or being cast in a school play? If tons of kids want to play basketball is it okay to have an A team and a B team based on ability level? If kids are learning to read is it okay differentiate so that they\u2019re learning at a developmentally appropriate pace? \n\nThis isn\u2019t even mentioning that there might be some sort of restriction based on group size. If there are enough kids that even 12-15 are in each day, that is a really big group to handle.", "She didn't exclude anyone, though. On the contrary, she was teaching 3 times a week to be able to teach all 50 interested kids properly.", "Sounds like a great place for them to learn some basics before moving on to the harder dances.", ">it\u2019s during the school day so I would assume so\n\nTeachers do a lot of things during school day that are both paid, and unpaid. Would your perception change if you knew that she's doing this for free?\n\n>She said the teacher told them the group was too big to have everyone dance at the same time, so she would make three groups.\n\nAnd based on her answer, is there something wrong with doing this?", "Well, evidently she was not paid anything for this. She was doing this as an extra enrichment activity for the kids. She was doing a nice thing and now you\u2019ve decided to create grief for her over it.", "So she held tryouts and sorted the kids into teams based on skill level?  Like every other sport in existence?", "If it was cancelled because you complained, then it was an optional thing that she was doing for free. And you've deprived all those kids of that enhancement to their lives.\n\nCongratulations on being \"that asshole\" and ruining things for everyone, including your poor daughter. I hope you're happy.", "Op, you seen too be about high school age by your last post 2 weeks ago.  We can still see your comments on it from your profile", "You don't know if having more individualized attention tailored to skill-level is a better way to learn? I'm sorry but...wtf?", "Making separate classes so that the huge turn out of kids allows them more personalized learning? Sounds like a good system to me.", "Oh YTA 100%. \n\nThat's a large group at one time especially if it's only one teacher (honestly even if it was two teachers at one time that  would be a very large group). As someone who took dance classes if a group is too big not everyone can see the instructor or have proper space to practice (which is just asking for kids to knock into each other and argue for space).  If the groups are too mixed advanced dancers might easily get bored while dancers that are trying to learn may struggle with the speed and difficulty. With too big a class a teacher will not have the time for individualized instruction and would definitely make it harder for the whole group to maximize time.\n\nYour daughter was having fun and probably getting better and your changes would make it harder for everyone?", "You don't know? You know that in most places she legally can't be responsible for that many kids on her own, right?", "Actually that teachers way of seperating kids into different groups, according to their levels is pretty common way for all of the courses.\n\nLike learning language. You seperate students according to the level of their knowledge, so you could make more appropriate study schedule and materials for their level.\nIts uneffective to make students with different levels to study the same material.", "And school sports", "Yeah I object to 4th graders not making a team. This is elementary school not high school.", "The kid is in 4th grade, not high school.", "Op gave some more info in comments. It looks like all of the kids have the same amount of time dancing (once a week) but the group was way too big and had to be split in three. Honestly if that was necessary, splitting by ability and experience makes the most sense.", "They all made a team though.  How would you divide up the kids into manageable sized groups?", "You do know that children in the 4th grade also play sports don\u2019t you?", "Yeah but they aren't high stakes getting cut sports. Elementary schools don't do this shit for good reason.", "Many elementary schools definitely have sports that differentiate or cut based on skill as do some have plays and other programs that are similar. My elementary growing up even had an art club that differentiated based on ability.", "Mine did. Not the only one I\u2019ve seen do it either. I get what you\u2019re saying and it does have merit but this concept of teams based on ability isn\u2019t unheard of. OP went and bullied someone over it. There\u2019s no excuse for that."]}
