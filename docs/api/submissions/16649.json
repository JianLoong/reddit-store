You weren't wrong to accuse him of being absent, yet again, for a big moment in your life. It's the truth.\n\nThe bottom line is that he is still a terrible father. A man who had actually learned wouldn't have allowed his wife to brag like that to the family he abandoned. He wouldn't put his commitment to the new family above the child he abandoned.

It is your wedding and up to you and your fiance who gets to come and who does not.  Given the history of your family life and how your dad handled things, I can understand why you would not want your step mom there.  Dad made some choices and they did not seem to include you into them.  \n\nOn the other hand, over time your dad has changed to where your step mom thinks he is the greatest man alive.  And maybe for them it is true.  He is in a different relationship now and what happens there if going to be different.  It does not diminish what happened to you and your mom.  And that is the sad part.  My kids dad chose his step kids over them time and again and went with the step mom's every word.  But that is not here or there.  \n\nIf your father can not understand and agree to do this for you, maybe it is not such a good idea to have him there as well.  If he is so focused on his wife and step sons over you, then you know what he is really like.  It is not his place to decide if his wife comes or not, it is yours, and if he can not agree to your wedding plans, just let it go.  Bring your mom and leave it at that.  \n\nIt is going to be up to your dad to make any sort of relationship to work. It should no be up to you.  I do hope things work out for your wedding day.  I hope maybe your dad can have a change of heart.  My kids never got that chance to see their dad get the change of heart and try to make some sort of peace with them.

When my son got married I had not seen my ex or his wife for about ten years.  They are horrible people.  But my son wanted his Dad to be there.  So I put on my big girl panties and ignored them.  Your parents need to stop and and remember that it's not about them.  I know how much this is hurting everyone.  While I understand your Mom's feelings, it is not reasonable to expect your Dad to attend without his wife.  Ask your Mom if there is a middle ground anywhere.

Her mother may have started a fight with her stepmother at that family gathering,  but her stepmother dragged a child into it. All that shit about all of OPs bad traits coming from her mother didn't fall on deaf ears. Op heard it and was probably extremely hurt by it.

It\u2019s abundantly clear that your mom is still angry over all issues with your father, and that is her problem not yours. She needs to grow the F up and let that shit go! And as far as your dad is concerned idk what he did for a living when you were growing up but you stated that he worked a lot, which I\u2019m sure if he hadn\u2019t you and your mother wouldn\u2019t have had the things that you did, roof over you head, food on the table, and clothes on your back. So you guys are mad at him for taking care of his family? I\u2019m confused. But for the sake of this post I\u2019ll go ahead and say he was an absentee father/husband. Now that being said I\u2019m sure he was a lot younger then and just starting out in his career and clearly wasn\u2019t doing the best job of juggling a family and working so your mom and him decided to split up. Ok.

So how is that a bad thing? Honestly it sounds like your mother is the toxic one here not your dad. Tell your mom to stop bitching about the past and get her into some therapy bc she needs to deal with all this anger she has towards your dad bc it\u2019s clearly straining your relationship with him. Your mom does not sound like a very good person, I\u2019m sorry but she doesn\u2019t. And honestly she\u2019s not a very good mother either for putting you in such a shitty position. Like WTH? You seriously need to take a step back and really think about how your mother is acting and hopefully you\u2019ll be able to see how toxic she really is.

In what world would you think he should do otherwise? \n\nI already like your Dad and I have never met him. He is solid. He acts like a good husband.

Grow up!\n\nEmotionally, of course there is plenty of baggage to go around. But, adults hopefully are raised to do the right thing. Obviously, you were not raised that way by your mother. It shows in the toxicity of her treatment towards your father and in yours also. You can be forgiven somewhat because your mother trained you to be that way the whole time your father was gone. \n\nThe right thing to do is to invite everyone and tell them all to stay away and don\u2019t show up if they even think about causing an uproar at your wedding. You can choose the high road and be pleasant to all. Unfortunately you were unable to do so but this is recoverable.\n\nThere are a lot of things that you left unsaid. For instance, why would your step mom call you out during the fight with your mother? It sounds like you must have offended her in some meaningful way prior. What did you do? Were you rude to her or your father? Did you pointedly ignore her or him or show disdain towards her? Or was it something more subtle? Your step mom must have picked up on something about you to include you in the verbal part of the battle. Or perhaps she was the type to go ballistic and include all and everyone in her verbal attack. It is difficult to discern everyone\u2019s point of view without hearing from all parties. From your description of the step moms praise towards your father, I would say those were ill thought out comments, particularly when said in front of your mother. She might be an extremely catty person but we don\u2019t have enough evidence to determine that. If there is something in your behaviour that triggered your step mom then you need to recognize that and decide to behave differently.\n\nYour mother and fathers relationship during their marriage is understated here. As is your relationship with your father. You do not say at what age you were when the divorce happened. What is quite clear is that you are jealous of his new family. Resentful as well.

Dad probably allowed his work to consume him and distract him from an unhappy marriage. This happens to many men. Your Mom is no prize! It\u2019s a tough situation to be in and divorce rips the heart out of most men, especially when there are children involved. How hard did your Mom make it on him to continue a relationship with you post divorce? Sounds like she is the type to grind him hard. Were you aware of any of those dynamics or were you too wrapped in your own misery to see what was happening around you? Again, you don\u2019t say the age at which you were when this happened. \n\nDivorce is hell. Most of the time unfortunately. It can take years to recover and it sounds like that is the case with your Dad. Your Mom? She has swallowed the bitter pill and is still choking on it.\n\nAnd you? It\u2019s not too late to sort yourself out and this mess as well. Some counselling might be good for you. Go see your Dad and apologize. Invite him and his wife and kids to your wedding.  Be happy for yourself and for them. \n\nAnd for goodness sakes, ask him to walk you down the aisle.", "Step mom needs to realize her hubby messed up BIG before her time with him and be sensitive to that.

On top of that, she actively prevents him from being there, doesn't tell him about events/recitals, books vacations on Father's Day, double books the child during his weekends and holidays, etc. He never protests as he doesn't want to upset Mom and then he just picks up more hours.

One option is to get married in private and fuck em all.", "Your mom is being the AH here. You don\u2019t put your kids in that situation.", "You need to decide what you want. Not what your mum or dad want. What do you want for your wedding. Both of your parents are putting themselves before you. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want any of them there.", "If your StepMum badmouthed you and said you were raised poorly and aren't a good person, why would you want her at your wedding? Seems unfair to blame the whole thing on your Mum not wanting your Dad's Wife there, when why do you want someone who trash talks you there in the 1st place?", "NTA imo she disinvited herself to the wedding when she started insulting you (and your mother)", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ve just had pretty much the same conversation with my absent father. \n\nI met up with him as it was my birthday, and his gift was to disinherit me (he\u2019s giving it to his current gf - I dgaf about the money) and bad mouth my mother (fuck that!) and stepfather (meh). \n\nIt comes to something when you\u2019re asked to leave a Wetherspoons", "NTA. All your parents suck, dude.", "With all due respect, YNTA, your mother is, a huge one. You are literally being blackmailed into not inviting someone SHE doesn't like. It is your wedding, your special day, and if she cannot behave like a decent human being for one day for her only daughter, then I really don't know what to say. Hopefully you guys manage to settle your differences, wish you all the best in your future marriage", "NTA. You might want to send your dad a letter just to clarify your position is as kind a way as possible. You can tell him that you admire his relationship with his wife (is she really your \"step mom\" if she's never parented you?), you admire how he is involved with his step kids. Although you hope that the hard feelings don't last forever, at this point you hope he can understand why you need to prioritize your mom's feelings, as she is your primary parent and the person who raised you (for better or for worse) because he was not available. While you understand that both he and his wife are upset that his wife is not invited, you want him to know that his presence, love, and support would mean the world to you and your partner as you embark on your own marriage together.", "Your parents are TA\u2019s. It\u2019s your wedding. Your stepmom should apologise to your mother and to you for the crap she said. There may be some truth in what she said (from her perspective) if she had nothing to do with your parents separation, but has had to put up with years of snide from your mum, which would have undoubtedly permeated into you to a degree, growing up. We\u2019re all influenced by our parents actions as children, so if you look back to time with your second family when you were a kid, can you hand on heart say that you didn\u2019t show her resentment by proxy from your mum? Ultimately though, she\u2019s the adult, and she was lucky by getting the good husband. \n\nYour mum should stop putting you in the middle of your parents and get over the jealousy over the man your dad wasn\u2019t to her but was to your stepmom. You should be able to have both of your parents present at your wedding without this childish animosity.\n\nYour dad has chosen your stepmom to be his life partner. Your mum\u2019s resentment shouldn\u2019t put him (or you) in an impossible position, especially after all of these years. She needs to grow up and move on.\n\nAnd yes, I know I\u2019m going to get down voted to hell for this from all of the Reddit warriors. I\u2019ve been both the kid and will potentially be the parent in this position too. This isn\u2019t throwing shade at you at all, OP, just trying to put an objective perspective on the overall situation.\n\nI hope your wedding goes well and you and your parents can move forward with positivity.", "I've never heard this before but I like it lol. I can picture the mother showing up drunk and being totally obnoxious if she were told not to come. In a perfect world the stepmother would bow out of attending, freeing her husband to go guilt free.", "Where did op blame her dad for that", "OP doesn't need to invite anyone who loudly picks apart her supposed flaws, and blames them on her mother.", "Its not slandering her though, they specifically are referring to the behavior.\n\n It has to suck to see the man you married and loved with all your heart be a better husband and father with someone else  other than you.\n\n It doesn\u2019t give her the right to exclude the new wife bcuz he manned up for their relationship and not hers but children\u2019s best interest at heart should always come first and OP wants both parents there. \n\nOP says she did this at her mother\u2019s request bcuz she would not come if the new wife did. That\u2019s being petty and mean and it is a AH thing to do to OP. Not saying that she is an AH in general but for this particular situation yes she is.", "I think regardless of the parents' relationships, stepmother crossed the line by directly attacking OP. To expect an invitation after demeaning and insulting  one half of the couple getting married is asinine", "I have a feeling that Ops mother completed let loose on her step mother first though\u2026 and we\u2019re not hearing any of the horrible things said, only step mom\u2019s retaliation.", "When a long relationship breaks up, and especially when one partner wasn't contributing enough to the relationship, a common trope is the slacker partner very quickly marries the next person they get into a relationship with. People say, \"when it's the right person it's just right\" or \"it wasn't the right time, now it is\" but I think there's a third option, it's the slacker desperately wanting to prove that they weren't the problem in their previous relationship. So they put more effort into the next one, and low and behold, the new relationship works out, because who wouldn't want a loving and thoughtful partner.\n\nAfter spending too much time on this sub, I think the same can be said about slacker parents and their new families. Your father is putting in all the effort he didn't give you so as not to appear like the problem person responsible for his marriage and family breaking down. \n\nThe whole situation is a giant manipulation of your father's making. Don't feel bad about not wanting to engage with these people who have swallowed his lies and vomit them back up at you when you try to voice your truthful life experience. Your father figured out that it's a hell of a lot easier to be the good guy when he was starting with a clean slate, he had no interest in repairing the damage he did to his first family even though he knew exactly what he should have been doing to not damage it in the first place.\n\nNTA", "I N F O: you said your dad promised to be better but it was \"too late\" then admitted you were jealous he's being better with his new family. Is this meant like he promised to be better but your mom divorced him anyway or he promised to be better but you had already decided not to forgive him?\n\nEdit: no comments from OP, info requests seen pointless.\n\nNTA it seems like everyone here sucks except you. You're in mom is the one who started the problem not your stepmom, but your stepmom sucks because she shrieked right back AND involved you in it. Your dad threatening to blow off your wedding because your mom doesn't want someone she hates there is stupid AF, it's YOUR wedding. You don't have to justify your guest list.", "Parents need to be adults here.", "Would really love to know what your AH dad had to say when you snapped at him like you did. Also NTA", "You're NTA. If you were not inviting her just because your mom couldn't deal with her, maybe you would be. But:\n\n>step mom also said stuff and was badmouthing about me like how badly I was raised, and how every bad quality I have in me is because of my mom's upbringing\n\nStepmom dealt herself out when when she dragged you into an argument with your mother. That was way out of line. If anything, this should be the you give your dad for not inviting his wife to your wedding.", "Your moms an asshole. So is your dad. You know what everyone is assholes here.", "NTA\n\nYour dad and stepmom didn\u2019t raise you. Your mother did.

They are the assholes. All three of them.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry that BOTH of your parents are still putting you in the middle. \n\nThey\u2019re adults. They need to put their own shit aside for YOU. In your mom\u2019s case this means acting like a respectful adult and simply ignoring the people you don\u2019t like instead of having a hissy fit and demanding that you have to disinvite someone. In your dad\u2019s case, this means being there for your kid and putting your kid first instead of his wife. \n\nThey\u2019ve both failed you again.

Your father is the asshole here. Honestly he doesn\u2019t sound like he has taken any accountability for his behavior.

I am trying to make up for it. I am doing better with my second wife. But that doesn\u2019t change the pain I caused either of you. \n\nThat is what a healed person says when they are confronted with their mistakes.

He continues to be a shitty father to OP.", "NTA who is your step mom to you really? Did she help raise you or do you have a good relationship? It\u2019s pretty messed up she started insulting you to take shots at your mom. She doesn\u2019t sound like a good enough person for you to be forced to invite. This is collateral damage from your dad being selfish in your childhood. He doesn\u2019t get to have the moral high ground when he helped create this situation. It sounds like he needs to do some work on your relationship and his wife isn\u2019t entitled for a wedding invite if you don\u2019t want to give one. This is about you and him.

She had the chance to experience the better father and turned it down but is now upset that he treats the stepsons better. But shes also NTA because this isnt even her fight and her mother is being a huge AH about this.
