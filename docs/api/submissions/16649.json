You weren't wrong to accuse him of being absent, yet again, for a big moment in your life. It's the truth.\n\nThe bottom line is that he is still a terrible father. A man who had actually learned wouldn't have allowed his wife to brag like that to the family he abandoned. He wouldn't put his commitment to the new family above the child he abandoned.

It is your wedding and up to you and your fiance who gets to come and who does not.  Given the history of your family life and how your dad handled things, I can understand why you would not want your step mom there.  Dad made some choices and they did not seem to include you into them.  \n\nOn the other hand, over time your dad has changed to where your step mom thinks he is the greatest man alive.  And maybe for them it is true.  He is in a different relationship now and what happens there if going to be different.  It does not diminish what happened to you and your mom.  And that is the sad part.  My kids dad chose his step kids over them time and again and went with the step mom's every word.  But that is not here or there.  \n\nIf your father can not understand and agree to do this for you, maybe it is not such a good idea to have him there as well.  If he is so focused on his wife and step sons over you, then you know what he is really like.  It is not his place to decide if his wife comes or not, it is yours, and if he can not agree to your wedding plans, just let it go.  Bring your mom and leave it at that.  \n\nIt is going to be up to your dad to make any sort of relationship to work. It should no be up to you.  I do hope things work out for your wedding day.  I hope maybe your dad can have a change of heart.  My kids never got that chance to see their dad get the change of heart and try to make some sort of peace with them.  He passed away about 2 years ago without doing anything.

When my son got married I had not seen my ex or his wife for about ten years.  They are horrible people.  But my son wanted his Dad to be there.  So I put on my big girl panties and ignored them.  Your parents need to stop and and remember that it's not about them.  I know how much this is hurting everyone.  While I understand your Mom's feelings, it is not reasonable to expect your Dad to attend without his wife.  Ask your Mom if there is a middle ground anywhere.

We invited everyone and just made sure there was distance between everyone.\n\nThere was a lot of animosity from my mom towards my dad after their divorce, and she wanted 2 graduation celebrations so she didn\u2019t have to see my dad or his family, and I told her TFB, it\u2019s my celebration and I don\u2019t care about her feelings because it was my day and she can get over herself for a few hours.", "NTA - But how do you feel? Do you want your stepmother there? She sounds awful (as does your father) - btw - so I don\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t want her there. But, your mom should not give you ultimatums.", "But the same time, OP\u2019s surrounded by assholes who put her in the middle of situations for their own selfish interests. Mom is an AH for the ultimatum and so is Dad for saying if new wife can\u2019t come he isn\u2019t willing to either. Neither of these pathetic people are thinking of their child\u2019s best interest.", "Same. It's sad that OP thinks of themselves as potentially the AH. More accurate to say the parents are! Can't set aside their drama for one day? Yeesh.", "Yeah that\u2019s where the step mom not being invited became fine for me.  Going after her was a low blow when she wasn\u2019t involved in the argument.  NTA", "This \u261d\ud83c\udffb", "Honestly, I don't think she didn't invite her stepmother just because of her mom. If she really wanted her stepmother there, she might've pushed against her mother further than that compromise. I think she didn't want the stepmother there, and her mom gave her a good excuse, so she didn't feel so bad about it. Honestly, I don't blame her. Her mother may have started a fight with her stepmother at that family gathering,  but her stepmother dragged a child into it. All that shit about all of OPs bad traits coming from her mother didn't fall on deaf ears. Op heard it and was probably extremely hurt by it. I'm willing to bet she only invited her stepmother to come because she wanted her dad there so maybe she could feel some validation she's been denied most of her life by her own father being an absentee.", "[removed]", "Sure maybe mom is being a little \u201cchildish\u201d, but I\u2019m not going to slander the parent that actually stayed and raised the children by themselves. She has a right to feel a way about it,but not a right to make the guest list. To me she\u2019s not as much of an AH. Maybe i\u2019m biased\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Maybe so. IMO when she used \u201cfine don\u2019t come to my wedding just be absent like everything else\u201d though she brings it all back around. I struggle to see how you can not invite your parent\u2019s spouse to your wedding and then blame them for the consequences too. Everyone here is toxic. Which isn\u2019t a surprise because the mom and dad are toxic. \nAlso, OP is 29.  Not a child. She\u2019s a grown woman. Maybe she should go NC with dad and step mom. But she should definitely recognize Mom as an issue too. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, based on Mom\u2019s drunken behavior at the family gathering, if step mom wasn\u2019t far off base regarding her parenting. I\u2019m sure mom says very few kind words about dad and step mom in her house. I doubt she keeps her opinion neutral. Like I said ESH- but step mom responded to being attacked.", "Daughter but I agree", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Is a good father and stepfather to new family. Both things can exist as true, and I can't exactly blame mom for being upset at the praise, but she also needs to recognize he is a different person to stepmother and has seemed to have grown in that regard\n\nHowever, it also seems like he hasn't actually mended bridges with OP and there is resentment there Dad needs to recognize. It doesn't sound like excluding stepmother was a hard decision for OP, which is kinda a signal Dad still hasn't really been involved enough for OP to have a relationship with stepmother\n\nIn short this is just a mess and someone needs to suck it up here. Given the backstory, more onus is on Dad to because Mom was the present parent for OP, tho her behavior is not great here either"]}
