A few years later my dad remarried another woman and now lives with her and her two sons who are 20 and 16.  True to his words my dad is a better husband to my step mom than he was to my mom and is very attentive towards my step siblings. This has made my mom very jealous and ngl but I'm a little jealous of them too.\n\nMy mom doesn't like my step mom and during a family gathering my mom overheard my step mom praising my dad about how much of a good husband and father he is. My mom being drunk got angry and created a scene and started sh!t talking about her and my dad, things got ugly and step mom also said stuff and was badmouthing about me like how badly I was raised, and how every bad quality I have in me is because of my mom's upbringing  and lets just that I am not very fond of her now.

So I called my dad and told him that due to their history I would appreciated if my step mom wont come to my wedding ( at least not to the main event but if she wants she can come to the reception) and told him that if she comes then my mom wont come. Obviously my dad is not happy with this. I told him to understand the situation and I would really like both of my parents to be present but he said if my step mom is not invited then he wont come either.

I think both of your parents are being very selfish and unfair. They\u2019re putting themselves first and you second. Your mother should be adult enough to stomach your stepmother\u2019s presence for a few hours. Your dad should be willing to be the bigger person and ask his wife not to attend the ceremony and join him at the reception. It would be a nice thing to do considering he wasn\u2019t there for you when you were growing up. I understand that you want your parents at your wedding but if they\u2019re going to behave like this it might be better if neither one is there.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding! You don\u2019t have to invite anyone you don\u2019t want to and it\u2019s really that simple. No explanation or reasoning needs to be given for that.\nIf your step-mother dislikes you and your mother that bad she can stay home", "You're the only NTA, everyone else sucks here.  \n\nIt's your wedding, you're not fond of your stepmother, so if you don't want her there, that's it.\n\nNow your parents are being selfish by letting their pettiness get in the way of YOUR day", "NTA, why would your step mom even care about coming to the wedding anyway since she clearly doesn't like you? Your dad not being there sounds like par for the course. Do whatever YOU want to do. If you're parents can't act like grownups at their child's wedding then they are putting themselves first and being selfish. Maybe elope, not worth the drama", "I heard a rather pathetic man who treated his own children like crap but his steps like royalty say the reason he is like that is \u201cI get to enjoy them because they are not mine and if I get sick of them I can just get rid of them.\u201d Seems like your dad is similar. NTA you\u2019re better off he\u2019s not there but talk to your mom and say \u201cyou got your way, I don\u2019t want to hear anymore about them in association with my wedding\u201d.", "NTA", "NTA just proving that your dad hasn\u2019t changed when it comes to you!

He and the wife weren\u2019t happy about it, but he stood up for his daughter.", "NTA. Your dad was a crappy husband to your mom and father to yourself. Just because his 2nd chance marriage and stepchildren are doing well doesn't erase who he treated you 2. Asking his wife to only attend the reception isn't a stretch given her history with both you and your mom.", "NTA. Invite and uninvite whomever you like. I really wouldn\u2019t want either of them at my wedding frankly.", "NTA, but your mom is putting you in an awful position here. A parent shouldn\u2019t make their child choose between them and the other parent. Pretty awful.", "So your drunk mom throws a fit, starts a feud, and somehow your dad is the one to blame?", "I'm sorry that they hate each other more than they love you.

Do you really think it will help your relationship going forward if you do this? You're jealous of his new family but you are denying him the opportunity to be a part of your life now. It's rude AF to not allow someone to bring their spouse to a wedding. This is your father. Even if he wasn't emotionally available why the hell do you think he was working and traveling so much? To take care of YOU. You are being immature and ungrateful and your Mom needs to get over herself. She should be ashamed to be causing drama and putting you in this situation. \n\nIt's your wedding and you can do what you want, but it shouldn't be too much for your mother to behave herself for one day and put the focus on you.", "They\u2019re putting themselves first and you second.", "Yeah this. I\u2019m going with your mom is the AH, and so are you. She is manipulating you on your special day and that\u2019s messed up. She is an adult and should be able to be there for her daughter on her wedding day, without conditions.", "Maybe, for once in his life, he could have chosen his son.", "NTA. The step mom lost all sympathy points when she started berating you in an argument that did not concern you. \n\nYour experiences of being abandoned are valid and no matter how good of a father he was *to her kids*, he still *failed you*. All the adultier adults here suck.", "NTA, your stepmom told everyone what she thought of you a human.  What is to keep her from doing that at your wedding.  Have your mom there for you as she always was.  Let your dad stay away as he always has.", "NTA and don\u2019t go back on this decision!\n\nMy toxic parents ruined my wedding reception by getting drunk and acting out of control\u2026 culminating in my mom attempting to assault my dad\u2019s GF, me having to wrestle her away in my wedding gown, and the police coming. Fun times in front of your new in-laws. Don\u2019t make the mistake I did and think your family will behave. They probably won\u2019t.", "I'm not sure about you, but your mom is a petty asshole.\n\nIs it that hard for her to make up and be civil for one single day? But no, it's easier for her to force an ultimatum on you.", "NTA. Both your parents (and step-mum) are absolutely shite. They\u2019re so selfish that none of them have considered you at all in all of this mess.", "NTA, the story was the icing on cake, but if your parents divorce and if either you/your mom have a rocky relationship with the step parent they don\u2019t get invited to the wedding. It doesn\u2019t even matter who was more of an AH in the fight, the step parent can\u2019t come.", "ESH. Your parents are toxic. Your mom started a drunk fight out of jealousy with your stepmom and then demanded you not invite her to your wedding. Your dad was a shitty dad. And you hold grudges against this women because your father learned from his mistakes? All if it\u2019s toxic. Step mom seems to be the least sucky right now but she shouldn\u2019t have brought up her opinion of your mothers parenting.", "NTA.  \nBoth of your parents are acting like children...", "Soft ESH\n\nYour mom has no right to dictate who you invite to your wedding.

Don't be blackmailed by her or allow her to get back at your dad.", "Your mom is the asshole. Sounds like your dad made some mistakes regarding work life balance, paid the price and has learned from it. To ask him not to bring his wife is an insult and can cause issues in his current marriage. He is in a no win situation.  If your mom never gave you that ultimatum, there wouldn\u2019t be an issue. She is the asshole.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are the AH here. YOur dad is reacting the only reasonable way.", "Your mom is the asshole.", "NTA, tell dad you would not want your poor qualities to rub off on his wife.", "Married couples are a set, like salt and pepper, they travel together.\n\nSo, if you insist on your stepmom not coming, it is entirely reasonable for your father to also not go.\n\nThe emotional blackmail was unnecessary.\n\nYTA", "I agree with this, parents shouldn\u2019t be putting their own bs in front of their children.

Also, was OP's mother working, or was she a SAHM? I can understand if he wasn't around all the time if he had to provide for 3 people", "Did you miss the bit where stepmom talked shit on OP in the process?", "Amen. Ignore the downvotes. Bio-mom sounds like a grade-A biatch. The father worked hard to support the family. The mother could have explained this to OP at the time, but it sounds like she helped create the narrative that OP's father was \"never present.\"\n\nNow OP's father has a happy marriage and the mother just can't stand that. She starts drunken fights, and now she's engineering another rift between OP and OP's father.\n\nOP is being led around by the nose.", "My husband provided for 8 people and didn't miss a thing our children did.
