I think both of your parents are being very selfish and unfair. They\u2019re putting themselves first and you second. Your mother should be adult enough to stomach your stepmother\u2019s presence for a few hours. Your dad should be willing to be the bigger person and ask his wife not to attend the ceremony and join him at the reception. It would be a nice thing to do considering he wasn\u2019t there for you when you were growing up. I understand that you want your parents at your wedding but if they\u2019re going to behave like this it might be better if neither one is there.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding! You don\u2019t have to invite anyone you don\u2019t want to and it\u2019s really that simple. No explanation or reasoning needs to be given for that.\nIf your step-mother dislikes you and your mother that bad she can stay home", "You're the only NTA, everyone else sucks here.  \n\nIt's your wedding, you're not fond of your stepmother, so if you don't want her there, that's it.\n\nNow your parents are being selfish by letting their pettiness get in the way of YOUR day", "NTA, why would your step mom even care about coming to the wedding anyway since she clearly doesn't like you? Your dad not being there sounds like par for the course. Do whatever YOU want to do. If you're parents can't act like grownups at their child's wedding then they are putting themselves first and being selfish. Maybe elope, not worth the drama", "I heard a rather pathetic man who treated his own children like crap but his steps like royalty say the reason he is like that is \u201cI get to enjoy them because they are not mine and if I get sick of them I can\u2019t just get rid of them.\u201d Seems like your dad is similar. NTA you\u2019re better off he\u2019s not there but talk to your mom and say \u201cyou got your way, I don\u2019t want to hear anymore about them in association with my wedding\u201d.", "NTA", "NTA just proving that your dad hasn\u2019t changed when it comes to you!

He and the wife weren\u2019t happy about it, but he stood up for his daughter.", "NTA. Your dad was a crappy husband to your mom and father to yourself. Just because his 2nd chance marriage and stepchildren are doing well doesn't erase who he treated you 2. Asking his wife to only attend the reception isn't a stretch given her history with both you and your mom.", "NTA. Invite and uninvite whomever you like. I really wouldn\u2019t want either of them at my wedding frankly.", "NTA, but your mom is putting you in an awful position here. A parent shouldn\u2019t make their child choose between them and the other parent. Pretty awful.", "So your drunk mom throws a fit, starts a feud, and somehow your dad is the one to blame?", "I'm sorry that they hate each other more than they love you. I hesitate to say that Y T A, but you need to remember that choices have consequences,  and choosing to exclude his wife put your father in the position to have to make a choice as well", "Not the asshole for the title question, a total asshole for attacking your father for not coming to the wedding without his wife.  Your drunken mother started the feud; I hope she's a happy drunk at your wedding.", "YTA & so is your mother, that\u2019s a completely unreasonable request if you had planned to invite them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do you really think it will help your relationship going forward if you do this? You're jealous of his new family but you are denying him the opportunity to be a part of your life now. It's rude AF to not allow someone to bring their spouse to a wedding. This is your father. Even if he wasn't emotionally available why the hell do you think he was working and traveling so much? To take care of YOU. You are being immature and ungrateful and your Mom needs to get over herself. She should be ashamed to be causing drama and putting you in this situation. \n\nIt's your wedding and you can do what you want, but it shouldn't be too much for your mother to behave herself for one day and put the focus on you.", "They\u2019re putting themselves first and you second.", "Yeah this.
