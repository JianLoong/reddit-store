You weren't wrong to accuse him of being absent, yet again, for a big moment in your life. It's the truth.\n\nThe bottom line is that he is still a terrible father. A man who had actually learned wouldn't have allowed his wife to brag like that to the family he abandoned. He wouldn't put his commitment to the new family above the child he abandoned.

It is your wedding and up to you and your fiance who gets to come and who does not.  Given the history of your family life and how your dad handled things, I can understand why you would not want your step mom there.  Dad made some choices and they did not seem to include you into them.  \n\nOn the other hand, over time your dad has changed to where your step mom thinks he is the greatest man alive.  And maybe for them it is true.  He is in a different relationship now and what happens there if going to be different.  It does not diminish what happened to you and your mom.  And that is the sad part.  My kids dad chose his step kids over them time and again and went with the step mom's every word.  But that is not here or there.  \n\nIf your father can not understand and agree to do this for you, maybe it is not such a good idea to have him there as well.  If he is so focused on his wife and step sons over you, then you know what he is really like.  It is not his place to decide if his wife comes or not, it is yours, and if he can not agree to your wedding plans, just let it go.  Bring your mom and leave it at that.  \n\nIt is going to be up to your dad to make any sort of relationship to work. It should no be up to you.  I do hope things work out for your wedding day.  I hope maybe your dad can have a change of heart.  My kids never got that chance to see their dad get the change of heart and try to make some sort of peace with them.  He passed away about 2 years ago without doing anything.

When my son got married I had not seen my ex or his wife for about ten years.  They are horrible people.  But my son wanted his Dad to be there.  So I put on my big girl panties and ignored them.  Your parents need to stop and and remember that it's not about them.  I know how much this is hurting everyone.  While I understand your Mom's feelings, it is not reasonable to expect your Dad to attend without his wife.  Ask your Mom if there is a middle ground anywhere.

Her mother may have started a fight with her stepmother at that family gathering,  but her stepmother dragged a child into it. All that shit about all of OPs bad traits coming from her mother didn't fall on deaf ears. Op heard it and was probably extremely hurt by it.

It\u2019s abundantly clear that your mom is still angry over all issues with your father, and that is her problem not yours. She needs to grow the F up and let that shit go! And as far as your dad is concerned idk what he did for a living when you were growing up but you stated that he worked a lot, which I\u2019m sure if he hadn\u2019t you and your mother wouldn\u2019t have had the things that you did, roof over you head, food on the table, and clothes on your back. So you guys are mad at him for taking care of his family? I\u2019m confused. But for the sake of this post I\u2019ll go ahead and say he was an absentee father/husband. Now that being said I\u2019m sure he was a lot younger then and just starting out in his career and clearly wasn\u2019t doing the best job of juggling a family and working so your mom and him decided to split up. Ok.

So how is that a bad thing? Honestly it sounds like your mother is the toxic one here not your dad. Tell your mom to stop bitching about the past and get her into some therapy bc she needs to deal with all this anger she has towards your dad bc it\u2019s clearly straining your relationship with him. Your mom does not sound like a very good person, I\u2019m sorry but she doesn\u2019t. And honestly she\u2019s not a very good mother either for putting you in such a shitty position. Like WTH? You seriously need to take a step back and really think about how your mother is acting and hopefully you\u2019ll be able to see how toxic she really is.

In what world would you think he should do otherwise? \n\nI already like your Dad and I have never met him. He is solid. He acts like a good husband.

Grow up!\n\nEmotionally, of course there is plenty of baggage to go around. But, adults hopefully are raised to do the right thing. Obviously, you were not raised that way by your mother. It shows in the toxicity of her treatment towards your father and in yours also. You can be forgiven somewhat because your mother trained you to be that way the whole time your father was gone. \n\nThe right thing to do is to invite everyone and tell them all to stay away and don\u2019t show up if they even think about causing an uproar at your wedding. You can choose the high road and be pleasant to all. Unfortunately you were unable to do so but this is recoverable.\n\nThere are a lot of things that you left unsaid. For instance, why would your step mom call you out during the fight with your mother? It sounds like you must have offended her in some meaningful way prior. What did you do? Were you rude to her or your father? Did you pointedly ignore her or him or show disdain towards her? Or was it something more subtle? Your step mom must have picked up on something about you to include you in the verbal part of the battle. Or perhaps she was the type to go ballistic and include all and everyone in her verbal attack. It is difficult to discern everyone\u2019s point of view without hearing from all parties. From your description of the step moms praise towards your father, I would say those were ill thought out comments, particularly when said in front of your mother. She might be an extremely catty person but we don\u2019t have enough evidence to determine that. If there is something in your behaviour that triggered your step mom then you need to recognize that and decide to behave differently.\n\nYour mother and fathers relationship during their marriage is understated here. As is your relationship with your father. You do not say at what age you were when the divorce happened. What is quite clear is that you are jealous of his new family. Resentful as well.

Dad probably allowed his work to consume him and distract him from an unhappy marriage. This happens to many men. Your Mom is no prize! It\u2019s a tough situation to be in and divorce rips the heart out of most men, especially when there are children involved. How hard did your Mom make it on him to continue a relationship with you post divorce? Sounds like she is the type to grind him hard. Were you aware of any of those dynamics or were you too wrapped in your own misery to see what was happening around you? Again, you don\u2019t say the age at which you were when this happened. \n\nDivorce is hell. Most of the time unfortunately. It can take years to recover and it sounds like that is the case with your Dad. Your Mom? She has swallowed the bitter pill and is still choking on it.\n\nAnd you? It\u2019s not too late to sort yourself out and this mess as well. Some counselling might be good for you. Go see your Dad and apologize. Invite him and his wife and kids to your wedding.  Be happy for yourself and for them. \n\nAnd for goodness sakes, ask him to walk you down the aisle.", "Step mom needs to realize her hubby messed up BIG before her time with him and be sensitive to that.

Mom attached her ex and his new wife, new wife went for the kid instead. \n\nI'm not expecting the new wife to be the bigger person when verbally attacked, I mean fuck mom, but why attack OP? OP didn't indicate that her mom attacked her step-siblings.", "I doubt it was directed at OP. Mom attacked the new couple as parents & step attacked back. OP was an unfortunate bystander due to being the child in question.\n\nIt\u2019s not great but I can understand how it happened. \n\nIMO Mom needs to grow up. Yes her marriage was bitter but push that aside for a couple hours for the sake of your kid rather than putting them in middle of old marital disputes. Those disputes were \u201csolved\u201d when they got divorced.", "For me I honestly don't understand how it happened. I've never been insulted and thought \"ya know what I'll bring their kid into this\" Mom is an AH but Stepmom crossed a line. And it's very clear the father isn't doing much to help mend the relationship between him and OP"]}
