I\u2019m trying to be impartial cuz they\u2019re not my kids but!! My brother was always really picky growing up and really really resented anyone making him try foods so I THINK this is him trying to avoid doing the same with his kids. But the payoff is they\u2019re rude and ungrateful and completely unwilling to try anything new ever. Like they\u2019re sweet kids and they try and say please and thank you but it\u2019s rly hard cooking for hours to have them be like \u201cit tastes icky\u201d to my face like that\u2019s a completely okay thing to say.

He's not giving his kids the chance to decide for themselves.", "Yes, it\u2019s introducing the idea that there is something out of the ordinary on their plate.

Can\u2019t blame the kids when their dad is basically using them to make a bigger impact with his own pickiness.", "I can\u2019t estrange my niece and nephew over food haha. It just requires being confrontational. I just told him I\u2019m not making breakfast and he\u2019s welcome to. He\u2019s offended i don\u2019t own Bisquick? Idk. It\u2019s a delicate line.

I was trying to keep it simple and also not completely bland. And the brand he\u2019d told me about had garlic powder and onion powder in the ingredients so I did my best \ud83d\ude2c I think he just wanted me to have it plain and like maybe with salt. Idk. I\u2019m learning to cook and eat mostly vegetarian and don\u2019t cook ground beef often.

That would require effort and intention. He gets his kicks from disturbing you and causing this drama. \n\nListen to your old aunt Jen, asserting yourself will go a lot farther in building a successful adult relationship between you and your brothers than giving in to their behaviors and eating your heart out. \n\nIt takes a little practice, but so worthwhile in the end. Not even family has the right to treat you the way your brother behaves. \u201cTemperamental and nukes he people he doesn\u2019t like.\u201d\nNo one deserves that behavior. Does he love you or not?", "As an aside: does your brother eat/feed his kids a lot of processed foods? I\u2019ve noticed he asked if you had taco seasoning, and he\u2019s irked that you don\u2019t own Bisquick. For people who eat a lot of instant foods, freshly-made food  can taste odd. This in no way justifies his behaviour or priming his kids to hate your food before they\u2019ve tried it, but it might go somewhere to explain why he doesn\u2019t like your cooking.\n\nFor the record, taco seasoning contains onion powder. So you\u2019re perfectly right to add onions. Tell him that next time he whines about what you\u2019re making for them.", "So tell him: next time, bring some items you like. But from now on,  do not say anything but thank you when I share my food and efforts with you.", "You gotta get to a mental place where that doesn\u2019t bother you. Think Not that your next door brother managed to make food they liked and you couldn\u2019t, but that you didn\u2019t have to cook because you know how to work your family to get out of doing that extra work. If you can make it a positive and think of it as a weakness in them, not a reflection of you, it\u2019s stops mattering as much, speaking from personal experience.", "Oh wow. Yeah, your brother sounds controlling.", "It\u2019s your home. You\u2019re not overstepping, you\u2019re being manipulated. Put your foot down, OP.", "What brand was it? Because most taco seasonings are chili powder based.", "Yeah OP listen to this. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing that justifies his behavior towards you, even less if he\u2019s a guest. Guests are guests because they are enjoying the good will and hospitality of their hosts. It does sound like he gets kicks from disturbing you and watching you go out of your way to accommodate him when in reality, due to circumstances, it should be him being thankful for being hosted.\n\nNTA. You should look into that dynamic for your own mental health.", "He does yeah. I\u2019m learning that. I\u2019ve been farming on a small scale for the past few years and before that I never ever cooked so I\u2019ve been learning to cook solely from scratch (out of necessity haha I have so much farm bounty and raw ingredients) and completely skipped over the processed food stage. If that makes sense? That\u2019s a helpful perspective thank you. \n\nAnd I think he was just lying or misspoke about the taco seasoning and I just don\u2019t get why. He later said he\u2019d never put stuff in his meat and I was like that cannot be true wtf but I didn\u2019t say that. And he had asked about taco seasoning! So idk there\u2019s like 5 kids running around between his kids and my other brothers kids and I had just spent HOURS baking with the kids in the kitchen \u201chelping\u201d me which was cute but like super exhausting so maybe I misunderstood. The whole thing was just so defeating to be so tired and to have spent like 6 hours in the kitchen total to have no one eat and to be insulted \ud83d\ude2d but family is family", "Idk the big yellow one that says taco seasoning haha. I think El Paso? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not trying to be obtuse I just don\u2019t buy it so I\u2019m not sure. I know they\u2019re chili based and left to my own devices I would have added chili flakes or at least a hot pepper of some sort. But they definitely won\u2019t eat that if it\u2019s even a little spicy so I skipped that. But the rest of the ingredients were things like pepper and onion and garlic powder. I don\u2019t have loads of powders in my cupboard. But I do have onions and garlic from my garden!", "You mean the one where the first ingredient is chili powder? [oldelpaso.com/products/taco-seasoning-mix-original-1-oz-packet](https://oldelpaso.com/products/taco-seasoning-mix-original-1-oz-packet)\n\nThe generic \"spice\" in the ingredients is cumin among other things.\n\nLike you can keep saying they don't eat it but they do if they eat that XD And again the flavour profiles between spices and garlic and onions is very different.", "Literally my entire point is they lie and are being rude and I don\u2019t understand why. Pls stop you\u2019re just stressing me out I don\u2019t get what point you\u2019re trying to make. I don\u2019t have powder and I made seasoned meat for tacos to the best of my ability.
