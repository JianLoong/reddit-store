Consent is still a thing.", "So how is it a similar situation then?", "They\u2019re literally keeping a diary of their sex as they listen through the walls. Super creepy.", "Oh?\nI can turn that on you, lovie. \n\nYou are just a pervert who likes it when you know you have an audience, even if it's just the audio. And that is why you insist on being loud enough to wake people up.\nEven when they say they do not want to hear it, and therefore do not want to participate in your weirdly loud sex.", "I actually think it's creepier that you know your neighbours can hear you, and yet you've made no moves to keep the noise down. So like what, do you guys get off on your neighbours hearing you? Do you not care about their right to quiet enjoyment of their house? How is them recording noise events to make a complaint worse than you having loud sex that continues to bother your neighbours, thus necessitating a noise complaint?", "Or your irregular fucking is disturbing their ability to enjoy their apartment without either being woken up by the sounds of said irregular fucking or having their workday interrupted by it.\n\nJust have quieter sex, god damn.", "How about you just keep it down? It's that simple. You're an adult. No one should have to listen to you and your boyfriend getting it on. \n\nIf it wasn't clear enough, YOU are the problem here, not your neighbour.\n\nYTA.", "No one wants to hear you having sex, that doesn'tmake your neighbor a prude. If you can't move to a place where you don't share walls with others, then stop being assholes and stop being loud enough for others to hear. This is just embarrassing to read.", "Hmm.  I know my upstairs neighbors fought off and on for almost 9 hours yesterday.  Guess how I know?\n\nBECAUSE I FUCKING HEARD THEM!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI guess hearing them makes me a busybody.", "What, exactly, is your neighbor supposed to do if you won\u2019t shut the hell up then? Just lie there, listening to you bang the night away but not say anything because it might hurt your precious feelings? They are still hearing it and being disturbed but you don\u2019t have to feel any feelings about it if they don\u2019t say anything. You sound super rude and entitled.", "Imagine keeping a log of someone else\u2019s sex. It\u2019s disturbing. I can\u2019t imagine ever confessing to doing such a thing let alone doing it to begin with. Sorry your neighbours are so rude. NTA btw", "Y\u2019all are allowed to fuck, but when you\u2019re in a space that has thin walls it\u2019s courtesy to keep it down a bit.\n\nAlso if it\u2019s loud enough for the neighbors to hear I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if your kids can hear too.", "You cannot be serious? You think they should go away when you want to have loud sex? That is very wierd... It is not creepy to document when your neighbors are making so much noise that it is disturbing sleep/normal life. Whatever the cause of the noise.. It is how you make a complaint in a civilized matter, by documenting the occurance.\n\nWhat if they had kids in the bedroom that shared a wall with you and they wake up every time? What if their quality of life actually goes down by getting woken up at night? Most does not like to listen to other people have sex, at any time of the day.. you make them listen by not being considerate (moving the bed, get some furniture in between, closing the window, trying to be more quiet). This is not their fault. This is your fault, and you are being the unreasonable one.\n\nYTA", "Yeah, but be quiet, god", "Were you aware that it's actually possible to ***not*** scream like a banshee when you're having sex?\n\nHave some class. You live in an apartment. When you get your own place or start renting a house, you can be as loud as you want. Until then, pipe down.", "Just think if it\u2019s loud enough for your neighbours to complain, imagine how loud it is for your kids \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Stop. Making. So. Much. Noise.", "You\u2019re allowed to have sex *quietly*, so that you don\u2019t disturb others. If people in another apartment can hear any noise from yours, your expectation of privacy is nil.", "I have a neighbor just like you, and it's the absolutely worst. Just be quiet", "I\u2019d rather hear banging on the wall than the type of banging your doing", "No. It's completely unreasonable for you to expect your neighbors to leave their own home just because you're loud during sex. Especially when you admitted you have sex at weird times.", "They shouldn\u2019t have to in their own apartment. Why do you have to be so loud?", "You really couldn\u2019t have got an actual house instead of an apt? Or be slightly quieter? Welcome to apt living! And no no one is going to *leave their apartments* for you just because you\u2019re too busy to get sex whenever you want it. It\u2019s called ~consequences~", "Why would they leave their home to not hear you have sex? Soundproof your walls.", "I\u2019m 90% sure your neighbors are working from home and their coworkers know you as the creepy neighbor who insists on having loud sex while they\u2019re working even after being told everyone can hear you. Depending on the work culture, it\u2019s either super awkward or they openly debate whether or not you get off from knowing other people can hear you.", "There is NO NEED to have loud sex. Good lord yta", "Multiple noise complaints are enough reason for them to not renew your lease. It's not somehow more acceptable to disturb your neighbors because you're having sex instead of doing something else.", "Excessive noise complaints can get you kicked out before the lease is over in many places. Not just the landlord refusing to renew your lease.", "Multiple noise complaints is definitely a valid reason not to let you renew", "At a certain point, noise becomes a nuisance regardless of what time it is - sure, it would probably be worse at 2am, but that doesn't make it \"normal\" at any other time.", "Not for shift workers? Or young children? Or if someone is sick in bed?", "You all should have reported that then! They don't. We kind of caught wind of who was in the apartment and it's just some single girl.", "No.  The neighbor is merely keeping track of how many times the peaceful enjoyment of their own apartment is being disturbed by the OP's sex noises.\n\nThe neighbors wouldn't know a damn thing if OP kept it down.", "Literally", "Ugh, I once shared a bedroom wall with noisy neighbors. My MOM was staying with me. She came into my room to say goodnight (she was going to be sleeping on the hide a bed), and she heard the noises. She said,  \"What's that???\" Haha, as if she didn't know. I was like,  \"Um idk...\" So embarrassing to hear someone screwing, and my Mom is right there. Uuugh. Yeah, I think we were both embarrassed and just pretended like nothing has happened. But i guess with OP's logic, I was supposed to go somewhere else? Um, no it was bedtime,  and I had to work the next day.", "Why should I be quiet when enjoying myself.", "This is all we could afford right now between the kids and our jobs. We live in a pretty moderate housing area, but we're aren't able to buy a house and renting them is out of the budget when we can find them", "Young children would have been awake and making noise way earlier than that.", "Reported them like your neighbor reported you?\n\nIt's amazing how much of an asshole you are!", "So you're saying your neighbor had every right to report you then?", "I hope she starts blasting music to drown out the sound of you.  Something really not sexy. Like the Barney theme song or any other annoying children's song.  Perhaps a taste of how obnoxious you're being will get you to stop being an AH.", "Because you\u2019re being selfish and entitled. When your enjoyment infringes on others, it\u2019s your fault. It\u2019s your responsibility to mitigate.", "I guess you don't have to be quiet. They way you're arguing indicates that you don't plan to fix the problem.\n\nGood luck renting another place for your kids once you have an eviction on your record!\n\nI guess you can have loud sex in the car while the kids sleep in the front seat.\n\nYTA", "So that you don't have neighbours upset, so much so that not only do they complain, they document. You're going to be the ones kicked out, not her, because you are the source of the problem. Landlords don't like problems. Getting rid of your neighbour means the problem is still there, and the next person suffers too. Getting rid of you means the problem goes away.", "Because it's basic decency? You're so unashamedly inconsiderate and selfish. Nobody wants to hear you have sex. You're whining that they're 'listening' but you're forcing them to. And suggesting they leave is not ok - they should be able to use all of the rooms in their home all the time. YTA", "No one can force you to take it down a few octaves, but the complex also doesn't have to renew your lease after getting too many noise complaints about you.", "Troll", "Common courtesy. You know it's not okay, that's why you aren't making your satisfaction known when your children are home.", "So your neighbors don't know how you sound like when you come? I personally couldn't face my neighbors and look them in the face. Put on some music to drown the sound, no one wants to hear you bang \ud83e\udd23", "Because you're in close quarters with other people? How is that so hard to understand? Go buy a house if you don't want people to complain. And before you say \"we can't afford it\", the answer to that is deal with it and be courteous to others.", "And there it is.

I'm surprised OP hasn't given us a \"she's just jealous because we're having sex and she's not\" comment.  \n\nOP why are you even here?  You've gotten pretty much 99% feedback that you're the asshole, but you keep coming back with \"yeah, but....\" every time.  Why do you think your desire to have incredibly loud sexy time overrides her right to enjoy some quiet time in her apartment?
