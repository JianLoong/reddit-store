When she grabbed herself a second cupcake he said \u201cPut that back little piggy\u201d. She put it down and looked like she was going to cry, she then went and sat in the corner away from everyone and wouldn\u2019t really engage in anything after that, despite me trying to get her to join in. \n\nB, Z & N all had multiple cupcakes and it really bothered me he\u2019d called M out. \n\nI put some leftovers into boxes for them to take home and told M that I\u2019d put an extra cupcake in there for her. B\u2019s response was \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need it, look at her the little porker\u201d.\n\nM isn\u2019t fat - She\u2019s put on some weight recently, but in the way kids do before they have a massive growth spurt. \n\nI told B he was going to give her a complex and I told him that comments like that lead to disorders. \n\nHe said he was just looking out for his kids. Im not a parent, I don\u2019t understand that he needs to teach them to be healthy. I said as long as you have balance you can have eat like this sometimes.\n\nHe looked uncomfortable and tried to lighten the mood with \u201cwell at least she\u2019d be skinny\u201d and my response is the reason I think I am the AH - I said \u201cYeah, maybe she\u2019ll be so skinny she\u2019ll be dead\u201d. \n\nEveryone went quiet, apart from my youngest two nibblings who were tormenting my cat under the table.\n\nThey took their leftovers and went, B sent me a text later saying he was really mad about the way I handled things.

Calling her piggy is verbal abuse. Why seems everyone be okay with this in your family? Wtf.\n\n\n\n\"Atleast she be skinny\" .... my fucking blood boils. \n\n\n\nIt is also MORE likely to get fat if you have a bad relationship to food. He is teaching her nothing.", "NTA. He's not parenting he's bullying.", "NTA- this is a prime example of how to ensure your kid has an eating disorder. My dad has made little comments about my food/weight in the past and it\u2019s extremely hurtful especially in front of others.", "NTA. You might not be a parent, but since you had first hand experience with an ED, your input might be a lot more valuable in the matter. Pretending that just because someone is a parent they can do no harm and foul towards their offspring is top shelf ignorant. The world is full of broken and abused people who's parents just \"had the best intentions\".", "NTA\n\nIf he keeps going like this his kid is gonna have some heavy mental problems regarding weight and eating if that hast happened already. You dont fricking call your own kid piggy etc. immediate AH\n\nalso kids tormenting your cat?? wth?", "NTA not only did you speak up, you spoke up in front of your niece. Now she knows she has an ally in you. Your brother is a major AH calling his daughter names like that. Even if he thinks it he should never say something that cruel out loud to a child. WTF kind of father does that to a kid.", "nta.\n\nhe needs to understand that comments like that really have huge impact on what you eat and what you don\u2019t and lead to ED, especially when such comments come from people who matter a lot to you.", "You go OP. Someone needs to stand up for your niece. NTA.", "Sorry but fck your brother (no disrespect to you) but this gave me flashbacks. ED is coming if it's not already there. \nIf he says these things in front of you I don't want to know what else he says to her in the safety of his home.\n\nNTA and thank you for standing up for your niece.", "NTA. What is the honest f is wrong with your brother? He is destroying his own daughters self-esteem when she is at such a young age? If he is worried about her putting on weight there is a much better way to handle this. I would have deck you brother the second he called he daughter a piggy and shamed her into putting food back. the fact that his wife didn't say anything make me feel like this is normal behavior for him to berate his 11 year old daughter. Makes me wonder how he acts when he is with his wife and kids home alone. Does he go out of his way to do activities with his kids and show them healthy eating practices? Is he a picture of health or would you consider him over weight and/or out of shape?", "NTA - My uncle told me I was fat when I was ten, and it was a major part of the early destruction 9f my self esteem", "NTA he had it coming", "NTA.\n\nThe standard you walk past is the standard you accept. Girls are vulnerable to body image issues (yes, boys too but more so girls) and having your dad call you piggy isn't exactly nurturing. You have personal experience in this area and you're trying to help your niece.\n\nHe's sulking because your words landed.", "NTA \n\nThank god you stepped in when your brother was verbally abusing his daughter \n\nYou may be saving her life \n\nI hope you can still be there for her - she\u2019s lucky to have you", "NTA,\n\nNot at all in fact. You are a female and you have experienced an ED so you know much more about the subject than he does.\n\nIn the interest of peace I would apologize (even though you are not wrong) for how it was handled and tell him about your ED experience. Establish an open line of communication with him to help him to communicate with his daughter in a non destructive way. I also think you should keep in contact with your niece also to help counsel her through her dad's verbal & emotional abuse.\n\nHe obviously doesn't mean to hurt her he just doesn't know any better. Good luck. And apologizing even when you are not wrong is good practice for having a spouse - I do it all the time. \ud83e\udd23", "NTA\nNo fast person ever got slimmer from being fat shamed, but I can tell you from personal experience that a lot of people with an extra 5 pounds got fat. My family was a lot like your brother. From a young age I was told to eat less, was too big. Looking back at pictures from the time, I had a few pounds extra, but I was definitily not fat, especially not as far as I felt and remembered. Surprise, I actually became fat.\nAlso, looking at my own kids, I know that people just have a certain body. My eldest daughter has this amazing conventionally attractive figure: long legs, small waist, boobs in proportion. She can eat 5000 calories as a snack and mostly doesn't move. My youngest takes after me. She is stocky, she has a little belly. She enjoys cake as much as the next person, but she c also esta really healthy and doey sports 5 times a week. Good for your niece that she has someone in her corner.", "NTA. Next time call his ass out louder so that the niece at least hears someone\u2019s in her corner. Make sure she knows you\u2019re a safe person, because lord knows the rest of your family isn\u2019t.", "NTA. What he\u2019s doing is abuse. Is your SIL her mother? I\u2019m angry that she hasn\u2019t stepped in and protected M.", "Brother is the Primary AH but you're the mini AH for making the dead comment. I completely understand where you're coming from and your brother is giving his daughter a complex which she might suffer all her life and you did the right thing to call her out. But the only reason I think you're a soft AH is because you told snapped back with the dead comment which might come across as insensitive, especially to a little kid.", "ESH, but B sucks way more. You suck because you made the dead comment in front of the kids. This could affect M with her own thoughts as well as things Z and N may potentially say to her about it. B will absolutely give her a complex speaking to her that way. I'm shocked your SIL isn't addressing this. Does B know about your troubles with ED? Just curious. It's always tough with other people's kids because you really don't have much jurisdiction. I probably would have snapped back with something like, 'It doesn't take a parent to recognize abusive and manipulative behavior.'", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His is being a bully and only setting his daughter up for failure and a probable eating disorder. Epic fail as a dad. You are NTA but he sure is. When you get enough comments on here send it to him. Hopefully it will be a wake up call for him.", ".....no. Calling your kid a porker is not a necessity.", "Absolutely not and never should be. If you can't parent without being a bully, you shouldn't parent.", "Oh yeah, my comment was a lot more general than this post. Calling your kid names is never cool. I just meant that parents often have to do things or have their kid do things that the kid doesn\u2019t like.", "Most punishments could easily fall into the bullying category. Grounding a teenager because they did something the parent thinks is wrong is mean as fuck. The parent just gets a pass because it\u2019s \u201cparenting,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t also be called bullying in any other context.", "Not at all true, I think you need to talk to someone.", "You have a werid way of percieving bullying honestly.\n\n\nBullying is exclusion, name calling and physical abuse. None of those are acceptable in parenting.\n\n\nGrounding, chores and the limiting of priveleges are normal consequences and not part of bullying. \n\n\nGrounding might feel mean either way, but as parenting should be transparent, the consequence of something shouldn't be surprise.", "Grounding someone is isolating them. I\u2019m really not arguing that parenting = bullying. I\u2019m just saying that it can often look the same way out of context, or from the kid\u2019s pov."]}
