Looking back at pictures from the time, I had a few pounds extra, but I was definitily not fat, especially not as far as I felt and remembered. Surprise, I actually became fat.\nAlso, looking at my own kids, I know that people just have a certain body. My eldest daughter has this amazing conventionally attractive figure: long legs, small waist, boobs in proportion. She can eat 5000 calories as a snack and mostly doesn't move.

You suck because you made the dead comment in front of the kids. This could affect M with her own thoughts as well as things Z and N may potentially say to her about it. B will absolutely give her a complex speaking to her that way. I'm shocked your SIL isn't addressing this. Does B know about your troubles with ED? Just curious.

The fact that he allowed the other girl Z(9F) to have multiple cupcakes and singled out the oldest female due to her body size makes my blood boil! It's disgusting, and if/when Z starts putting on weight, he'll do the same to her, and likely the soon to be wife once she's \"above his ideal weight limit\" and becomes \"frumpy\". I'm a bit shocked he hasn't done so already, since 3 kids takes a hell of a toll on your body!\n\nI've struggled with weight my entire life, and even when I was skinny, I still saw myself as incredibly overweight. I've never been obese, but I've always seen myself as such. My mom did enroll me in some sort of nutrition therapy with a dietician when I was in late elementary school. I know she was only trying to help \"get ahead of the problem\" but it still made me feel like she thought I was fat. Especially since my sister has always been quite skinny, just like my mom.\n\nMy sister was the worst though. I was bullied for my weight throughout school, but she was my biggest tormentor. Her go-to was always \"fat tub of lard\". It stuck with me for MAANNYYY years!

They say that behind every joke there is always a bit or truth.

He bullied and shamed his child to the point where she withdrew from everyone and wouldn't re-join the group.\n\nSomeone has to stand up to your brother's nonsense before his daughter ends up with an eating disorder, so well done for doing so.

At worst he is full out abusing your niece and he is comfortable doing it in front of all of you, meaning he knows your family will either turn a blind eye or outright support him in it.", "I would suggest going and asking your brother why he thinks verbally abusing his daughter is a acceptable way to talk to her about her health.

You however are NTA and a saint!  Be the best aunt possible and a refuge for that baby!!", "NTA. Tell him his parenting suck. Calling your daughter a pig infront of everyone? That kid is going to have an ED and mental health issues. You can tell your kid to eat healthily in private. Maybe your SIL isn't saying anything because he find your brother an AH too. Only women who get verbally abuse by men would understand.", "ESH. Your brother is obviously a misogynistic mega AH. However, you should have shut him down hard the first time he called her a porker/piggy. You even put together a box of cupcakes for the guy who demeaned and bullied your daughter multiple times. The message your daughter would take away is OP agrees and it is okay for people who supposedly love to treat you like worthless dirt. You eventually, mildly stood up for her but are already questioning if keeping the peace with your brother is more important than your daughters self esteemand mental health. You are letting him dictate the relationship instead of telling that AH bullying your daughter is completely unacceptable. Unless he apologises and commits to NEVER doing that again, you will not be talking to him or going to his wedding. Get some backbone and protect your daughter. Given your mothers AH response, I am guessing your mother panders to her son and OP has internalised and excused a lot of emotional abuse as okay. Op - it is not normal or okay.

I see why you did it too since your wouldn't want her to go through the same thing you did at her age. Parents have a big influence on kids at that age and comments like that are VERY damaging to a child's self esteem and mental health.

You could also say your problems started about the age his daughter is now, and you don't want her to go through that pain.", "NTA. Your brother is. What he is doing can certainly lead to an eating disorder, and people can die from them. Parents should encourage healthy behavior of course, but calling a child a pig is not doing that.", "NTA.  Your nibbling, M is 11 years old.  Her body may look a little heavier because she is prepubescent.  Her father is verbally abusive and is encouraging ED.  \n\nI am so glad that your niece has you in her corner because it sounds like the other grownups in her life are not very nice people to her.", "NTA - he also gave you the adult equivalent of \u201cWell you\u2019re not invited to my birthday party then\u201d.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t want him at your wedding, so I wouldn\u2019t mind if he didn\u2019t come. That kid needs support from someone, I\u2019m just sorry to hear it isn\u2019t from their parents or grandparents. \n\nNTA - permanently.", "Nta.....I just recently went through this with my niece (8....7 when it almost started).....her mom made comments like calling her lazy and fat for no reason. Telling her to slow down on eating basically making her seem like she could only eat once a day. It took like almost 2 months of my sister and I talking to her and modifying my cooking to get her to eat again.\n\nShe's good now but I have to keep checking on her to make sure she wasn't or isn't damaged from it.", "NTA", "NTA He's definitely the A", "NTA. Your brother is verbally abusing his daughter and will absolutely give her a complex, meanwhile his sons can eat all they want, so hes sexist as well. Your Mom who is calling you an AH sure knows how to raise sons! Sadly you have to be careful since he could cut you off from her and CPS doesnt care about verbal abuse. Just be the rock your niece needs and let her know her dad is an idiot, she will probably figure it out herself at some point, I sure didz", "He's abusive and a bulky to his own child. He absolutely deserved to be called out. Maybe it will show his kids that they can stand up to him.\n\nNTA", "NTA! Good for you for standing up for someone that was unable to do themselves! The podcast Maintenance Phase explains these issues best. People would rather have skinny kids with EDs than happy kids with extra pounds! It\u2019s terrible! Also, they explain that most of the fat research (fat people at risk for dying, diabetes) is not accurate and skewed!", "NTA. I think it's great you stood up for your niece, somebody needed to. His behavior is disgusting.", "WTF how on earth does he think it\u2019s ok to speak to anyone, let alone his daughter like that? You are NTA but he is a massive one. This could so easily (if it hasn\u2019t already) turn into an eating disorder. You were looking out for your niece because her dad is a massive wanker!", "NTA. who TF ever calls their child or any child a piggy? She's a growing child. He needed a reality check.  I hope the mother doesn't allow this. That poor girl is going to need therapy.", "NTA. Comments from family members about my eating triggered a decade long stint of bulimia that I\u2019ve still not completely recovered from. Your response was certainly blunt, it expressed the seriousness of eating disorders very straightforwardly to your brother, who seems completely unaware of the detrimental impact he\u2019s having on his poor daughter\u2019s developing self esteem and wellbeing.\nYour brother\u2019s treatment of your niece seems abusive to me. I feel sorry for your niece. Please keep looking out for her.", "NTA, this is kinda abusive of him to say such things to a kid. Even an adult would start questioning themselves, let alone an 11 year old.", "NTA he\u2019d rather her be skinny than happy and healthy. Wtf is wrong with this guy?! A paediatrician or paediatric nutritionist would not be recommending his strategies at all.", "So crazy, I call my small children little piggies when they say burp right by my face, that is something they can control/do better next time by turning their head or something. I cannot imagine commenting on their eating in a mocking way. If he was honestly concerned he would be speaking to her doctor about if her weight was healthy. I bet he hasn\u2019t even taken her to the doctor. And probably SIL agrees with OP if she was there that day and didn\u2019t say anything to OP.", "Yeah my parents had this attitude when we were growing up (though they usually weren\u2019t this big of assholes about it). We\u2019re all overweight now. Teach your kids the importance of being healthy, not being skinny.", "All this, plus OP has the absolute right not to accept that type of talk in her own home. She sets the standards there.\n\n(Re-read it, I guess it was a dinner at her mother's house, still stands that OP has the right to not accept that kind of talk in her presence.)\n\nNTA.", "Exactly.

He singled out the oldest female due to her body size. It's disgusting, and if/when Z starts putting on weight, he'll do the same to her, and likely the soon to be wife once she's \"above his ideal weight limit\" and becomes \"frumpy\". I'm a bit shocked he hasn't done so already, since 3 kids takes a hell of a toll on your body!", "Or happy and fat\u2026", "I hear you. The adults in my family were so big on being skinny. Their offsprings - my generation - are either overweight or stick skinny due to unhealthy obsessesion with our food intake. We definitely struggle with food.", "I really hope this is just some edgy take from a kid and not a real standpoint of anyone parenting a child.", "OP mentioned his upcoming wedding. Maybe it did take a toll on the body of their mother so he found a newer model.", "NTA! Your trying to communicate to your thick headed brother that name calling and fat shaming is going to creat a problem for his daughter. She's 11 and her body is changing. What is he going to call her when puberty hits and she develops breasts? Please try and talk to your mom of your SIL and remind them about puberty. And give your niece a HUGE hug. It's not her fault her dad is ignorant. Please let her know it's ok to eat all things in moderation. And chocolate helps during her menstrual cycle. Long live chocolate! \ud83d\udc9c", "Z is younger though. I\u2019m sure her turn to be called \u2018porkie\u2019 and fat is coming. What an ignorant AH this man is. Many girls do have a bit of puppy fat at they head into puberty and then it all evens out.", "Doing something or making my kid do something that needs done isn\u2019t bullying, it\u2019s being a parent. That is not what this dad was doing.", "Making my toddler go to sleep on time is not bullying.\n\nMaking her take a shower isn\u2019t bullying. Making her get out of the shower isn\u2019t bullying. \n\nMaking a child wash their hands is not bullying. \n\nMaking a child hold your hand in a parking lot is not bullying.\n\nThere are plenty of things a child does not like. It doesn\u2019t mean it is bullying. Your first comment especially coupled with your second implies that if a kid doesn\u2019t like something but the parent makes them do it, then the parent is bullying the child. And that\u2019s just not true.", "That isn't bullying...", "Me thinks you don't understand what bullying is.", "You need to stop before you keep digging your hole deeper", "Limited Grounding is isolation in the same way as saying no to sweets is starving. \n\n\nI do understand you but I just hardly disagree that parenting often looks like bullying at all.", "Not a great analogy but I get what you\u2019re saying. And yeah, bullying pretty much didn\u2019t happen at my school growing up. The exception in my view at the time was the teachers bullying students that didn\u2019t align with how they thought kids should be. Which seems like a pretty 1-1 comparison with parenting."]}
