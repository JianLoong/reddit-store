What is the honest f is wrong with your brother? He is destroying his own daughters self-esteem when she is at such a young age? If he is worried about her putting on weight there is a much better way to handle this. I would have deck you brother the second he called he daughter a piggy and shamed her into putting food back. the fact that his wife didn't say anything make me feel like this is normal behavior for him to berate his 11 year old daughter. Makes me wonder how he acts when he is with his wife and kids home alone. Does he go out of his way to do activities with his kids and show them healthy eating practices? Is he a picture of health or would you consider him over weight and/or out of shape?", "NTA - My uncle told me I was fat when I was ten, and it was a major part of the early destruction 9f my self esteem", "NTA he had it coming", "NTA.\n\nThe standard you walk past is the standard you accept.

You are a female and you have experienced an ED so you know much more about the subject than he does.\n\nIn the interest of peace I would apologize (even though you are not wrong) for how it was handled and tell him about your ED experience. Establish an open line of communication with him to help him to communicate with his daughter in a non destructive way. I also think you should keep in contact with your niece also to help counsel her through her dad's verbal & emotional abuse.\n\nHe obviously doesn't mean to hurt her he just doesn't know any better.

My family was a lot like your brother. From a young age I was told to eat less, was too big. Looking back at pictures from the time, I had a few pounds extra, but I was definitily not fat, especially not as far as I felt and remembered. Surprise, I actually became fat.\nAlso, looking at my own kids, I know that people just have a certain body. My eldest daughter has this amazing conventionally attractive figure: long legs, small waist, boobs in proportion. She can eat 5000 calories as a snack and mostly doesn't move. My youngest takes after me. She is stocky, she has a little belly. She enjoys cake as much as the next person, but she c also esta really healthy and doey sports 5 times a week.

Don't understand why that's being voted down. \n\nESH, but B sucks way more. You suck because you made the dead comment in front of the kids. This could affect M with her own thoughts as well as things Z and N may potentially say to her about it. B will absolutely give her a complex speaking to her that way. I'm shocked your SIL isn't addressing this. Does B know about your troubles with ED? Just curious. It's always tough with other people's kids because you really don't have much jurisdiction.

The fact that he allowed the other girl Z(9F) to have multiple cupcakes and singled out the oldest female due to her body size makes my blood boil! It's disgusting, and if/when Z starts putting on weight, he'll do the same to her, and likely the soon to be wife once she's \"above his ideal weight limit\" and becomes \"frumpy\". I'm a bit shocked he hasn't done so already, since 3 kids takes a hell of a toll on your body!\n\nI've struggled with weight my entire life, and even when I was skinny, I still saw myself as incredibly overweight. I've never been obese, but I've always seen myself as such. My mom did enroll me in some sort of nutrition therapy with a dietician when I was in late elementary school. I know she was only trying to help \"get ahead of the problem\" but it still made me feel like she thought I was fat. Especially since my sister has always been quite skinny, just like my mom.\n\nMy sister was the worst though. I was bullied for my weight throughout school, but she was my biggest tormentor. Her go-to was always \"fat tub of lard\". It stuck with me for MAANNYYY years! I still hear her voice sometimes when I'm feeling really down on myself.\n\nAs adults we've discussed it and she's apologized over and over again, and cries whenever we discuss it or she brings it up, because she feels so terrible about how she made me feel and the effects it had on me\n I do appreciate her sincere apology and I've most definitely forgiven her bc we had a MUCH different relationship as kids than we do now as adults.\n\nAll that to say that the things dad is saying to her, which he's trying to disguise as \"jokes\", have very real consequences and true meaning behind them. They say that behind every joke there is always a bit or truth. And to have your parent...the one who's supposed to love you unconditionally...torment you and cut you to the bone like that...it's abhorrent and so vile.", "NTA-it's verbal abuse to make comments like that to anyone. How can a dad be so mean to his daughter like that..", "NTA.

He bullied and shamed his child to the point where she withdrew from everyone and wouldn't re-join the group.\n\nSomeone has to stand up to your brother's nonsense before his daughter ends up with an eating disorder, so well done for doing so.

I really fear for that poor girl's wellbeing.", "NTA \n\nYou showed a hell of a lot more restraint than I would have.\n\nThat was what he felt comfortable saying in front of people at a family gathering, which likely means that what he says in private is likely much worse. \n\nAt minimum he is perpetuating diet culture which is incredibly harmful especially for those of us socialized as girls and women. At worst he is full out abusing your niece and he is comfortable doing it in front of all of you, meaning he knows your family will either turn a blind eye or outright support him in it.", "I would suggest going and asking your brother why he thinks verbally abusing his daughter is a acceptable way to talk to her about her health.

I see why you did it too since your wouldn't want her to go through the same thing you did at her age. Parents have a big influence on kids at that age and comments like that are VERY damaging to a child's self esteem and mental health.

My heart breaks for that poor little girl - as someone who was put on a diet when I was 8 years old (when I had gained weight gearing up for puberty) and spent 25 years of my life having a disordered relationship with food and my body, this child is undoubtedly going to have complex trauma relating to her father's  comments and attitude. Not only that, but destroying her natural ability to eat intuitively NOW is actually likely to irreparably damage her metabolism. I'm a fat woman now (what'a considered \"small fat\", I'm on the lower end of plus size), but my natural set-point weight would not have been as high as it is had my metabolism not been utterly wrecked in childhood from dieting and eating disorders.

From there on, my dad always made comments about my weight. Whenever I lost weight, he'd mention about how \"huge\" I was.
