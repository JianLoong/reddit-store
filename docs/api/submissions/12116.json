We live in the same city but we don't really see each other very often. \n\nI lost my father a few years ago. My mom (60F) had a life-altering stroke a few months ago. My wife (36F) and I have been taking care of her since her health deteriorated. Admittedly it has been very hard for us because we have 2 kids (4 and 2 year old sons). \n\nMy sister and her wife (33F) have not helped us at all during this time. I admit they have two young kids but so do we. They haven't been there. Not physically, not emotionally and not financially. We have been the sole caretakers of my mom and we can't really afford to hire help. My sister does not value family much, and she only came to see mom a few times back at the hospital. That was it.\n\nSo I went to my sister's office to see her. After having to wait for 4 hours for her to be done with her meetings, I explained that I was really struggling with mom here and that I could use her help. My sister had a high-paying job and now has her own company and could at least help me out financially.\n\nShe said she didn't want to help. When I asked her to explain why, she said our parents had always put her second to their needs and prioritised me, that they always wanted to have a son to take care of them and to make the family name live on, and that it was time for them to get their wish.\n\nNow my dad did leave me a bit of his assets to start off my job, but that is because I followed in his footsteps unlike my sister who always sneaked out of the house and left home the day she hit 18. Then she went out to college and got into her super busy lifestyle. I don't think that takes the responsibility away from her.\n\nSo I told her she was being an AH to me and our mom who was having a very hard time and acting like a teenager. The conversation escalated which led to her telling me to not call her again and calling security. My wife tells me I was being a bit much but I don't know.

You made yourself a huge, obnoxious, exceedingly rude, entitled nuisance.\n\nIt sounds like you were the golden child.  Her behavior - the sneaking out, and leaving the moment she hit adulthood and never coming back, and having no desire to help now, are typical of someone who has been scapegoated and abused, at a minimum emotionally.

My guess is you have always been the Golden Child, simply because of your gender.\n\nNow, since she is a lesbian (as she has a wife), that would have likely made her even **worse** in their eyes.  So she was probably treated like, **at best**, a second class citizen.  You didn't see it because you were perceiving it through the lens of **your** treatment.  So you would always reason \"What would I have done for my parents to treat **me** this way?\"  This is fundamentally **WRONG** reasoning because she was never seen the same as you.\n\nIf I were in their shoes, and was treated as inferior my entire life for something I had no control over, I would have gone permanent NC with the lot of you long ago.

That's not what happened here. Even assuming the very best of anyone involved, it is perfectly clear that your sister and your mother didn't have a great relationship. Your sister received the bare minimum required by law from her parents, supporting her till she was 18, so no, she has no particular moral responsibility to care for her elderly mother, while you received more benefits from them, so you feel an obligation. {This is very similar to how inheritance worked in my country till the 1950s; daughters received a dowery and were married off, sons inherited, but they had to support the elderly parents and any daughters that remained single. Not a great system, but there was a certain fairness about it.} Also, she has made it clear she isn't interested in a closer relationship or willing to provide care, so you can't claim her lack of support took you by surprise; your parents (and you) should have known that she wouldn't have been stepping up; it sounds as if you are very resentful about it, but that's not reasonable of you, it was completely predictable based on your parents' treatment of her and her own behaviour in the past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, personally I feel that a child shouldn't let their parents suffer if they can help them (barring abuse of course), and in some jurisdiction elderly parents even have a legal claim to financial support. If you and your family are genuinely struggling with your mother's care, and since your sister is well-off, it would have been fine to schedule a meeting with your sister, tell her what is going on and ask for help, either financial or otherwise. But she has every right to say no, or, assuming there is a legal obligation on her part, limit her help to the minimum.  Your own opinion on what your mother and you \"deserve\" from your sister doesn't matter, nor does your very clear diapproval of her life choices. What you did was completely inappropriate: you tried to ambush your sister at her work, you demanded things you weren't entitled to demand, you dismissed her (probably very valid) complaints against your parents and, if you had to be escorted out by security, you probably became belligerent about it.

It shouldn't be your responsibility, either.  Assuming your sister wanted to help (and she doesn't) you would still have a major problem as caring for mom 50% of the time would be way too much for either of you to handle on a long-term basis.\n\nMom needs to go to some kind of professional care facility.

YTA", "Just a little note - she could be bisexual with a wife. Outside of that - this comment hits the nail on the head. As a bi woman with a sexist/misogynistic/deeply patriarchal family and a younger brother golden child - my brother acts *exactly* like this guy and like your thought process in the comment. He constantly acted like *I* had done something wrong to make my parents treat me that way, instead of being able to see that they loved & valued him more than me and I was acting out because of how obvious it was.\n\nOP - if your sister is anything like me, your mother won\u2019t see a dime from her. Ever. Your parents squashed that chance in her childhood. She doesn\u2019t owe them anything.", "> You waited four hours?  Who was taking care of your mom while you were wasting that time?\n\nHis wife, of course.  He doesn't need to trouble himself with that kind of Women Work.", "If you've enjoyed fucking around, then you may also enjoy finding out! Or maybe you won't. But you'll get to anyway! (OP btw, not you fellow commenter)", "My thoughts exactly. OP either doesn\u2019t know the whole story about his sisters upbringing compared to his or is purposefully excluding it from this post. Either way, OP\u2019s sister set a boundary and is sticking to it. OP reaped the benefits of, I would assume, traditional parents, now he gets to live with the result. OP YTA.", "BTW. YTA.", "How is the sister cold hearted?", "I think it depends on how wronged the sister was. Depending how despicably she was treated and how much of a blind eye he turned or joined in on, she doesn\u2019t owe them a thing. You are absolutely right, caregiving is exhausting, selfless, and loving, but he\u2019s leaving out a lot of background as to why she is refusing. I have a feeling her being a lesbian probably had a lot to do with how she was treated. I work with elderly and their negative/harmful/abusive actions unfortunately come to light when it comes to family explaining why they won\u2019t help. I am empathetic to the family and move on to find public resources to help the patient. Just because they don\u2019t remember due to illness, doesn\u2019t mean their bad actions never happened", "I find it fascinating because I usually see, on this sub, posts from OP's sister's standpoint.  And I always support them going permanent NC with the family who pushed them aside.\n\nSeeing a post from the Golden Child is a first for me.\n\nFamily is not always biology.  And I am glad OP's sister found her Family of Choice.", "Eh, that hardly means much. Plenty of high-acheiving career people marry and have children without being family-orientated; it's a common stereotype for wealthy men, and I don't see why a businesswoman in 2023 with a wife at home might not be the same. But in this case, I agree the OP porbably means his sister doesn't value their family of origin much.", "I  not saying bad actions never happened.\n\nI am saying that OP is the one doing 100% of caregiving work, pays all the money and all that. Caregiver burnout is a real thing and fairly often there are no magical public resources to bail you out.  I am fine with idea of OP being salty about sister doing literal zero. Unless OP was the one being abusive. Usually it is women who find themselves being expected to do caregiving, now it is a guy, but it is pretty much the same thing.", "OP isn't doing the work, OP's wife is."]}
