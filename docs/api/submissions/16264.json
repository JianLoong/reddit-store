I also lost a lot of my memories of him because I suffered a TBI in the same accident my dad died in. My mom remarried within 18 months of dad dying.

I said one time that I was not interested in remarrying and have ignored comments like that since and continued on with my life.

I told her we were different people. She told me that she did what she needed to do for my best interest and that I should consider that, because my kids are going to get to an age where anyone I meet will be kept as stepmom and not mom.

I snapped when she would not drop it and I told her I don't want to be like her. I told her I do not want to replace Willow. That my kids have me, they have grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, they have friends, they have so many people in their lives and they are not suffering terribly because I do not want to remarry.

The most important thing for your children is to have a loving parent who will care for them and support them as the grow.  If you are doing that, then you are being a good father.  You do not need to get married again just to give them a mother.  They have a mother, unfortunately she passed, but she will always be their mother.  Maybe one day you will decide you are ready to meet someone else, but that day if it comes doesn't have to be now.\n\n\nYour mother needs to stop lying to herself, her remarrying so quickly was in her best interests, not yours.  All you did was state how you feel, if she didn't like hearing the truth, it still doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA\n\nIt needed saying.\n\nThis sub and the relationships subs are *swamped* with awful problems that were  caused by parents re-marrying far too soon after a divorce or bereavement. It seems to fuck up the kids far more than being short of one parent does.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't just out of the blue say you didn't want to be like her, she pushed and you responded. She said that her remarrying had been the best thing for you, and you would have been lying if you had agreed. \n\nI'd like to think she'll quit pushing so hard after that conversation, but she probably won't given her parting statement that you aren't being a good father. \n\nI really hope that her anger isn't partly because she married someone she didn't love just to give you a \"dad,\" and now she's finding that you never saw him that way.", "NTA.\n\nYou are in absolutely no way required to remarry or date just to give a mom figure to your kids. You're perfectly capable of being a father to them and providing the support they need without a mother. What your mom said is very insensitive to you and while what you said may have hurt her, she kept pushing you and now knows where you stand.\n\nYou aren't a bad father by any means for grieving the mother of your children.", "NTA and as you said everyone is different. Ask the kids if they want a mother in their life and if the answer is positive and if you feel like dating, you can consider the option. If not, there's no point in pushing adult decisions on their lives. They would be happier to have more time with you and for respecting their decision if they want to just continue the way life is. I am sure their mother's memories would continue to be with them and with all the friends and relatives, they would be fine. You mom is clearly trying to push her views on you and you have every right to push back and decide what's good for you and the kids. Also how you feel towards your step father is upto to you and I am of the opinion that everyone can decide for themselves how they feel towards others.", "NTA, your mother, definitely one... Both for continually badgering you, and for getting butthurt when you snapped at her.  Bringing a new stepmother into your family is not necessarily beneficial to your kids.  I'd bet money that your mom remarrying so soon, was NOT for your benefit, but for hers. \n\nYou take all the time that you want to grieve.  There's no set limit on how long someone should.  I can totally understand where you're coming from with your view on it.  Worry about your children, not your mom.", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019re doing your best to be a good father to your kids, and them having a loving and supportive parent to help them get through something as formative as losing their mother is far more important than the arbitrary idea of a nuclear family. Kids don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d a mother and father, what they need is love, and it sounds like you\u2019ve got that covered just fine on your own. \n\nYour mother is projecting onto you and trying to enforce her ideals onto you, an adult with children, is out of line. It sounds like you kept things civil and are just looking out for yourself and your kids. You\u2019re not a bad father for making different choices than her.\n\nSending love and support!", "NTA. Is your stepdad aware that your mom (apparently) only married him to \"give\" you \"another\" father?! Because that sounds horrible -- I can't imagine living it -- and you are definitely NOT a bad father just because you don't share her delusional viewpoint.", "NTA and I am sorry you have suffered such deep losses.\n\nPersonally, I think you are handling the loss of your wife in an incredibly mature and sensitive way. You are right. Willow will never be replaced, and anyone you meet in the future will be taking on a role that involves that fact. That will be decided when and if you are ready to date again.\n\nYour mother wanted to make herself feel better. It wasn't really about finding a father for you. The fact that she is pushing so hard without respecting your decision is showing her own insecurities.\n\nIt takes a village to raise children, even more so when a parent dies. Keep loving them and keep sharing memories of their mother. If someone special comes along and wants to be a part of the family, they can then share those memories with her and make new ones together.", "So so so NTA. When will parents get it through their heads that their children are separate humans with different lives? Good grief. I'm so sorry for all of this.", "NTA. You are communicating in so many ways that you do not agree that her marrying your stepdad was the right decision for you. It is so frustrating that your mother does not hear you, and keeps living in the reality where she selflessly provided you with a father.", "NTA. You are communicating in so many ways that you do not agree that her marrying your stepdad was the right decision for you. It is so frustrating that your mother does not hear you, and keeps living in the reality where she selflessly provided you with a father.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised by your mothers view that a step parent is bad, and worse that you have to slot someone in to replace their mother. I don\u2019t think your mum is being malicious, honestly she sounds like she has still not come to terms with her own circumstances and sees you repeating what she did as approval. I imagine it was incredibly difficult for her at the time knowing what was right. However, that doesn\u2019t mean she can place her own issues on you. \n\nI\u2019d feel very uncomfortable entering someone\u2019s life with expectation of being a \u2018mother replacement.\u2019 I just wouldn\u2019t do it. I think it\u2019s unhealthy. Of course you may meet someone one day, and your children may come to regard her as a mother, but that still isn\u2019t a replacement. \nMy dads mum remarried after his dad died. He was 8. He was never allowed to talk about his dad as this was his new dad. A forced new family. It affected him a great deal throughout his own life. \nYou are doing what is right for you and your children. The idea that a child must have two parents is naive. You sound like a wonderful dad. Keep doing what you are doing.", "NTA. Needed saying. I'm so sorry for your loss x", "OP, you're NTA, but here me out. I lost my mum when I was 10 (2 years after my parents divorced). My dad never remarried and didn't even start dating until I was as dad put it \"big enough and ugly enough to look after myself\" so 17/18 and I think it was only his way of preparing for the loneliness that would come when I eventually moved out and started my own family (although now in my 30s he still calls me at least once a day sometimes more). \n\nWhile he stayed single, that didn't stop him from meeting women and becoming friends, and a few of them he became close enough with to introduce me to as friends but more importantly as \"mother like figures\". They were all strong, independent women who were willing to help me in any way I needed. Luckily for my dad between mums death and moving in with him, I was living with my aunt and uncle (nightmare), and that was where I had gotten my first period, so he was able to avoid those awkward conversations and I would just put my pads in the shopping trolley when we went shopping without any discussion.\n\nI will be one of the first to admit that while I did end up calling two of those women \"mum\", they weren't the same as the real deal, but while they weren't the same, I was still greatful I had them in my life.\n\nI hope my story can help you come to terms with the idea of finding a middle ground between \"not replacing Willow\" and your mother's insistence that the kids \"need a new mum\". One of the women my dad introduced me to (one of my adopted mums) was also in a similar set of shoes to my dad (divorced and widowed- dad agreed to the divorce despite still being in love with my mum) and she was also able to be someone for dad to talk to and build a friendship with and they were close right up until she died unexpectedly from cancer 4years ago.", "First let me say one widower to another, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. This a tricky one tbh. In some ways yes, in others no. One of the things I\u2019ve learned is that while people may have the best of intentions their ability to properly communicate those are usually lacking. I do believe that your mom has the best of intentions if not for you at least her grandchildren. At the same time your children do not need a replacement mom. They have a mom. That\u2019s not saying that seeing you in a healthy relationship or having a motherly figure , that\u2019s not auntie or grandma, wouldn\u2019t be beneficial for the kids. I say tell mom that she just needs to back off about it and just give it time. No time doesn\u2019t fix anything you just get used to it. But no one knows what or who the future holds for us.

The kids have cousins, uncles, aunts, friends, they have each other, they have a father, they have grandfathers and grandmothers. A grandmother can be a mother to her grandchildren. Theoretically, after the mother comes the grand-mother and thus the mother word in her role. MOTHER. NTA I've seen so many grandmothers raising their grandchildren as their children.", "If you rush off to replace Willow, you validate your mum's decision to do the same. For what it is worth, I think you should be open to the idea of remarrying for the right reasons. When you are ready and happen to meet someone who gets along with your kids, doesn't consider herself in competition with Willow's memory and generally makes you happy, I think you should be open to the idea of dating that person. But rushing off to replace and erase your childrens' mother out of some misguided notion they need a new mum is a terrible reason to get married. I don't want to be nasty but your mum did it for herself because she couldn't cope with being alone. But that is too ugly a truth so she pretties it up by convincing herself she did it for your sake. It probably feels like a criticism that you are handling parenting alone. I actually don't think your mum is a monster. Parenting is really hard and getting remarried was probably the right decision for her. But she is now making your choices about her and it is okay to draw a boundary and tell her to stop. NTA.", "If you're not ready to date then don't date. Do not deny yourself romantic love in the future because you are still young but no need to rush it. Your mom is pushing this because if you find a new romantic relationship soon and get married then it justifies her decision to marry so soon after your dad's death. Definitely NTA. She did what she felt was right back then and right now you are doing the same.", "Children don\u2019t need a \u201cfather\u201d or a \u201cmother\u201d, they need people who love them and put them first.

NTA", "That is something my therapist told me. She said that wanting to date again and being ready to date again are very personal things. That I should take my time, trust myself and my ability to recognize my own emotions, and know that neither choice is wrong. She told me some people fall into such extremes that it becomes unhealthy. She said remarrying isn't healthy or unhealthy just like choosing never to isn't. But it's when you are rigid to the point of judging others and forcing feelings on yourself that either becomes unhealthy and something you need to work on.\n\nI don't think my mom will ever accept that. I'm not even mad at her for making the choice. But it is frustrating to have it shoved down my throat so forcefully again 20+ years later.", "I think some of it comes from the whole kids are resilient thing and also the idea that all kids long for a mom and a dad. Those two things together mean people will often assume or convince themselves their kid wants and needs a new parent and that the death of their parent or divorce of their parents is something that will be better without doing anything, and that the way to speed it up is to give them back what they are missing. But not every kid craves that. My best friend was raised by a single mom who was a single mom by choice. Never once did he talk about needing a dad or wishing he had one. I didn't crave a new dad when I lost mine and honestly, I hated that it was assumed he was my dad because I was so young at the time.\n\nTherapy for me would have helped make it less upsetting. But I remember feeling bad that my mom had moved on so fast and expected me to do the same. I don't hate her or my stepdad for it. But I will never say it was what I wanted or needed either.", "There could be some element of that. I don't think she necessarily went out looking for a second spouse who was exactly what she wanted, but more, who would be willing to become an instant dad to the child she already had. There are some things in my mom and stepdad's relationship that makes me suspect they aren't great as a couple exactly, but he was eager to be my dad and they have children together now so I don't know that the marriage will exactly end. But I don't know that my mom would have chosen him as husband number two if I didn't exist or if I had been \"too old\" in her mind to replace dad.", "She's always had this idea that the only way to heal healthily is to essentially replace the deceased parent with someone living. I think it goes back to the whole idea some people have that a mom and a dad are needed and every kid wants and needs both. She truly believes that seeing the stepparent as new mom or new dad somehow fixes the kid or takes away the grief for their deceased parent. I think deep down she's always had to acknowledge on some level that my stepdad was always my stepdad and not my dad, because I have never called him dad. But that she still convinced herself that I did consider him my new dad and that I had moved on from my dad to her husband. He has come to terms with not being my dad, I believe, better than mom has. But he married my mom expecting he'd be my dad from the beginning.", "I'm sorry for your loss as well. I think my mom likely has a lot of feelings because I am making a different choice than she did, and you are right that her intentions are probably good, if not driven somewhat by fear of facing the reality of how I feel about her remarrying.", "It seems like you are trying your best to do what's right for both yourself and your children.  Your therapist sounds like she is very good.  As she said, trust yourself.", "> I think some of it comes from the whole kids are resilient thing and also the idea that all kids long for a mom and a dad. \n\nYup. There is some truth in each of those statements, but only some. They are not infinitely resilient, and two parents could almost be seen as a  luxury not a necessity. (Heck, even orphans do OK.)\n\n\n>people will often assume or convince themselves \n\n... that the kid conveniently wants exactly what they themself want.\n\n(However, do be sure you are not making the same mistake!)\n\n--\n\nQuite apart from all this, telling *anyone* that they need to marry is tactless, tasteless, rude, inappropriate, disgusting, intrusive... and to do it to a new widower is appalling, cruel, and dismissive.\n\nMum needs to go in time out for a little while.", "Honestly if it were me I might try to gently make that point to her. That maybe she\u2019s upset bc she made certain decisions and made sacrifices that came along with those choices, and is taking it personally that you are making different choices jn a similar (but not the same) situation. And that you understand why it might be hurtful if part of your decision making process was your experience living through the natural consequences of her choices but ultimately her choices were hers to live with and yours are yours. She doesn\u2019t get to use your life choices to validate her own decades later.", "I actively make sure I don't make the same mistakes with my kids. It's my goal that they can always be honest with me and that I understand that sometimes our needs and wants will be different and that it's okay.", "NTA. Take your time. Brining someone new to children after a massive loss is not a small thing and should not be treated lightly. Many children suffer when step parents are not who their bio parent expected them to be. And some kids can never find it in them to accept step parents fully. Sure, there are also many who managed to strike the jackpot, but a lot of work needs to be put in. Your mother needs to respect your decision. You are doing great so far.", "NTA and OP, if you ever happen to find someone you want to share life with again, and your kids don't see that person as a mother, that is more than okay. They have a mum who loved them, cherished them, and they have a surviving parent who keeps the memory of their mother alive and important. \n\nSometimes kids end up viewing stepparents just the same as bio parents but that happens naturally and without pressure and not by trying to erase the memory of the lost parent. \n\nYour kids are loved, safe, they have family, and they know they had mum who loved them. You're being a good father. \n\nIf you ever find love again, if you want that, let your children take the lead on what they want to call or feel for that person. If that person is supporting and loving and accepting of them and not trying to replace their mother, that will be enough. If you never remarry and never bring another person into the family that will be enough as well. \n\nYour kids don't need a replacement mother. They need you.", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re a good dad to put your kids first. \n\nI don\u2019t have the exact words and I\u2019m afraid if I did, I\u2019d be banned, but it seems that so many parents, who either divorce or lose their signifying other, want or even need to move on very quickly\u2026 irregardless of how it would affect their kids. Basically, it seems that these kinds of parents care about their own needs and comfort (need for companionship, both physical and mental) first and since children are often deemed as quick-adapting, somehow it translates as \u201cthe kids will be fine, but I won\u2019t be\u201d. And then years later, some of them end here, full of anger and resentment towards their remaining parent for substituting their missing parent asap. \n\nYour mom did what she wanted or needed to do at the time.

Firstly, your kids deserve a loving and stable family and that can look 100 different ways. You are providing that already.

You don't need to rush out and remarry because your a bumbling male aristocrat with no clue how to care for children. Fathers are equally capable of being loving, supportive, capable parents on their own. After 4 years, you and your kids have likely developed a special and unique rhythm that works for you.

I lost my partner to Covid 2 years ago. I am in another relationship now. His other partner, though, is not. She has had a much, much harder time dealing with his death than I have, for a multitude of reasons. Neither of us is right, and neither of us is wrong in this. \n\nReading through your post and some of your comments, I suspect your mom's insistence that she married again because you needed a father (figure) was likely a response to people muttering about her remarrying so soon after your dad passed. Marrying again within 18 months of losing a spouse is considered super quick by most. I'm with another commenter that said SHE probably can't be alone-- my partner's other partner is like that-- but telling everyone she was doing it for you may very well have minimized the gossip. Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely not saying that she was straight-up lying about that being her reasoning. People can convince themselves of a lot of things and truly believe it. I'm betting she truly did think she was doing what was best for you, considering how society insists a boy needs a father and a girl needs a mother, but the underlying fact of the matter was that she needed someone. \n\nYou don't need someone. That's very apparent. And that's perfectly fine. With no desire to start a relationship, what's your mom expect you to do, just go find someone you think you can tolerate? You had an issue with your stepdad and the attempt to have him replace your dad, and your mom actually wanted someone. If you just married whoever specifically because you bought Mom's insistence that the kids need a mother, you can multiply your issues with your stepdad exponentially, and that's only if you find someone who's not going to wind up being abusive or neglectful towards the kids in some way. Add on to that the guilt your kids, particularly the older one, would feel if the relationship between you and this hypothetical mother replacement was a bad one and they found out you only married her for them. There's no need to be setting them up for failure like that, someone you clearly understand and your mother doesn't. \n\nYou sound like a good dad. Keep doing what you're doing. If you meet someone and things spark, that's one thing, but there's no need to force yourself. I'm going to go on the assumption that grandma is, for the most part, a good person and good grandma to the kids so I wouldn't say that you need to go low/no contact over this like some other commenters feel. Assuming she's good with the kids, that wouldn't be fair to them. However, I would suggest that you start shutting this particular conversation down hard from now on. She's made her opinion known. She doesn't need to keep on about it. Let her know that you're done discussing this, that if you start a new relationship, it'll be on your terms, and that of she insists on bringing it up, you'll be ending the conversations right there. Hang up the phone. Walk away. Leave the house, or ask her to leave. You're an adult, and you have that right now. \n\nIf you have a decent relationship with her husband, might I suggest enlisting his help in this? Sit down and have a conversation with him that your mom keeps insisting you follow her path and that while you get why she did it, that you're not her and don't want to start dating just to date or just for the kids. Assuming he can be made to understand where you're coming from (if he doesn't already-- he may already get it considering y'all's relationship) he may be able to explain it to her in a way she'll understand. Or maybe not, if she's the stubborn type that always feels she knows what's best for everyone. All of my aunts are like that. But it may be worth a try.", "NTA. As someone who is a 23f and also lost their mom very young (10), I think it\u2019s awful when widowed parents think they need to \u201cfill\u201d in that parent role with their partner.

My stepmom will never fill that role and has never because she\u2019s not my parent nor have any maternal instincts. It has now created a disconnect with my dad and I too.

You are not.  Plenty of kids are raised by single parents.  You are doing what is best for you and your kids in this situation.  It is not her place to keep insisting on you to replace their mother and your wife.  You cannot replace her.  I would just focus on you and the kids and tell her for now on the subject is closed and there will be no further conversations about the topic.", "NTA but I have a slightly different take I think. \n\nYour mom might have truly had your best interest in mind when deciding to remarry. It's quite possible she also had financial and household stability in mind when doing so. I think you should tread carefully on criticizing her choices, and should assume the best in terms of her motivations for having gotten remarried 22 years ago. If you do, saying you don't want to be like her isn't very kind, because from her perspective she had your well being in mind, so of course you should want to be like that. \n\nI think the reality is that you DO have your kids' best interests in mind, but that has caused you to reach a different conclusion than she did when she faced the loss of her spouse. You are rightly focused on making sure they are supported and as well-adjusted as possible. \n\nShe should not have said you were being a bad father, she should not be fretting about missing the chance to make your kids see a new parental figure as their 'mom', and should absolutely not be pressuring you to do anything you don't want to do - for these reasons she is TA. But I think you could have a conciliatory conversation with her in which you express your hurt at her words and attitude, but also recognize that she made the choice she felt was best for you and that *you are already doing the same thing*.

What is important is that you provide a safe, loving environment for your children", "Yes", "The way I see it a child needs a parent. They don't need a mom or dad specifically. They just need an adult to care for them. Doesn't matter if that adult is a man or a woman.", "imo, NTA.

They have so much trauma they are still working through because of her. They did divorce but a little too late. Damage was done. He carries so much guilt about it. \n\nPoint is, be picky about who you let into your kids\u2019 lives. They don\u2019t need a new mom just for the sake of having a mom. They need people in their lives who will love them. They have that with you. If you find someone to marry someday, great!

You are a good father.", "NTA but it isn't either or. \n\nYour children don't need you to spend their whole lives mourning, and it could be healthy and beneficial to see you move on. \n\nBut you should NOT date to find them a mother, replace their mother, or to end your grieving. \n\nDate if you want to date. Be open to the possibility of having someone else in your life. But don't do it for your children.

But she would have probably done the same if you weren't her child. You aren't going to use that excuse for your children, and I believe you would be able to date and remarry without making them feel like you're replacing their mother.)\n\nWhether you are widowed or just single or divorced, you should always start dating again at your own pace.

If you're patient and wait, the right person WILL come along. \n\nMy oldest son was just 3 when his mom decided she couldn't handle being a wife and mother anymore (she had a lot of issues from her own childhood) and left us both. She didn't have much contact with our son for the first several years.

Dated a couple of women and once I figured out they weren't what I thought was best for both of us, I cut it off. Holding out for the best paid off. I finally met my current wife and we are now coming up on 20 years of marriage this summer. We have another son together that is now 17. Not only is she the sweetest, most caring person I ever met and a truly amazing wife, she has never treated my own son any different than the son we have together. They are very close. \n\nMy oldest son is now married and has a 4 year old daughter of his own who only sees her real grandmother (my ex) maybe twice a year but sees us and stays over at our house all the time so my current wife is the only grandmother she knows and they absolutely love each other. My wife couldn't love her anymore if she was her own flesh-and-blood granddaughter.", "Definitely NTA.  Sounds like your mom has a serious martyr complex.  There's no time limit on grieving.

I do believe humans are wired for companionship but your post reads as if you are still in love with and still grieving your wife. My heart goes out to you & your children. \nWhile my vote is my vote, your mom is saying what she is saying from a place of love and concern. You might use that if she ever brings this up again:  \u201cI know you are talking out of love and concern, mom, but do not bring this up again. My life is not yours and I do not want to remarry. And, mom, I love you, but that is the END of this discussion and the last time I\u2019ll explain myself. Next time, I\u2019ll get myself & the kids and we\u2019ll leave.

We\u2019ve recently started with a custody mediator who specializes in children and their unique (NOT-adult) psychology, and all this to set the stage for what she\u2019s made crystal clear over the last couple of sessions: \n\nKids need to *feel* like the priority. Introducing a new partner too soon, especially one with children of their own, is a surefire way to have your own kids going down some really damaging and easily preventable mental roads. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t daddy spending time with just us? Is something wrong with me? Is that new person/are his or children more important than me?\u201d etc etc. Not saying *anything at all* about how lovely and good that new person/their kids is/are, and in no way implying that a single parent *shouldn\u2019t* date or meet their emotional or physical needs with another adult. But that that very adult decision *needs* to be kept from view/the kids need to be fully insulated from that information for at least the first year of the separation of kids\u2019 parents, and more importantly at least a year from making the new relationship official/serious/committed. \n\nAllll that to say, even *if* you were ready to start dating, actively shielding your kids from even the knowledge that you *are* dating is vital in helping your children form secure attachments and preventing negative, long-lasting disruption to their core sense of self. So, in case you need to hear that too, experts in the field of child psychology agree that your perspective is healthy and correct, and that your mom\u2019s is\u2026 not. \n\nBest of luck to you, OP, and I\u2019m so so so sorry for your & your kids\u2019 loss of Willow.

I never realised healing doesn't need 'dating'. Every healing is unique and different journey. I realised it only when I faced similar loss and more than a decade later, I can clearly say I healed from the loss, moved on from the gut wrenching grief but never moved on from my love. \n\nSomehow, through my healing, I arrived to the conclusion that he's my one and only and till the day I meet him in one way or other I want to live my life completely by enjoying myself, loving myself.

These little things bring extreme joy to me. And like many others before my grief I thought these bonds are unhealthy. \n\nNow I still got judged by my family for the decision I took in my healing journey. I'm not lonely. I'm missing my person and that's ok. But that empty spot makes them so uncomfortable that they need to 'fix me'. However I explained that I'm happy with this version of me, it was hard to make them understand. Because those who don't date (after few years) of a loss are in minority and they often get judged so easily. \n\nThankfully I came across this wonderful article and sharing with my family completely changed their view on healing and grieving. \n\nThe author is the therapist and she writes why she will never date and about her true love. She says how saying no for dating is also ok and my family thought that's unhealthy until they read that article. \n\nI have experiences of arguing with my friends and family who tried to 'save' me from myself just because I choose to not date.

Whatever path you choose in future, hope it brings peace and happiness.", "I know I\u2019m late so I hope you see this. You\u2019re doing the right thing. \n\nYou can never replace a parent. I\u2019m married to a widower. I am not his children\u2019s mother. Im not really even their stepmother. They were adults when I met their father. I\u2019m a caring older adult who\u2019s married to their father. If I tried to be anything else I\u2019d be overstepping. And because I won\u2019t overstep we have a great relationship. But we see over and over again on this sub parents trying to force relationships between a new spouse and their kids. It never ends well. The relationships that do work are the ones where the new spouse doesn\u2019t try to replace the other parent, but embraces the role of stepparent or parent\u2019s spouse. There\u2019s nothing wrong with those roles. They can be amazing roles. I don\u2019t feel lesser because my partner\u2019s kids feel about me as exactly who I am: an adult that loves them that is sharing a life with their father. If you ever do decide you want to date again, that\u2019s the outlook you\u2019re looking for. Your kids don\u2019t need a mother. They have a mother, but she is unfortunately no longer with you. But if you do find another woman with whom you\u2019d like to share your life, make sure she knows that stepmother isn\u2019t a lesser role. It\u2019s a different role and can be just as beautiful. \n\nAnd I\u2019d tell your mother this: \u201cimagine how close we might have been if you hadn\u2019t tried to replace the father I already had and lost. We could have had an amazing stepfather/stepchild relationship but you chose to try to force something that could never happen, and look what did happen\u201d. Make her really think about the damage she caused.", "It\u2019s a complicated one, and honestly I\u2019d be wary of taking Reddit commentary to heart. I think your query of whether you are an asshole is pretty straightforward, you are not. As for the other information, redditors will generally jump to scold and go to the worst places to make someone out as terrible as they can if they see any fault in their actions and apply that with little empathy. \n\nYour mum lost her husband as a mother to a child. You have better understanding of that fear and trauma than 99.9% of the people commenting and providing advice on something they have never experienced. I don\u2019t know how old your mother was, but even today the pressure to have a nuclear family is all around us, and even going back ten years, more so. For woman to lose often the primary breadwinner was especially daunting and society did teach folks that a couple is best. I imagine seeing her son experiencing a similar fate raises a lot of issues for her. It would be unrealistic to say she should not feel anything and deny her that trauma, but\u2026\n\nI think the issue is her calling you a bad dad. It could be reacting but with what you are dealing with currently, completely uncalled for. Your views may differ but taking a different path does not make you a bad father. In the same way I\u2019d argue your mum wasn\u2019t being a bad mother in her choices, unless there is missing information. That\u2019s the bit perhaps she needs to understand and degrading you does not help anyone. \n\nI think it\u2019s great you are getting support. It seems your mum thinks you can pick up all feelings and feel exactly about someone else. Your children have a mother. One day you may meet someone and find you fall in love. It doesn\u2019t mean you are replacing your wife, you may just fall in love as deeply, but differently. And the same analogy for your children should someone come in to their lives. But it has to be in your terms. I hope your mums expectation of you loving your stepdad exactly like your dad doesn\u2019t make you fear that future. We have room for lots of love, and it\u2019s not degrading the memory of another to love again. You can love both and respect both mean something as can your children, if they choose. \n\nFrom your posts you seem very thoughtful and I hope you can get past this.

I found out I had been lied to and I swore then and there I was done dating till BOTH my kids were older. I was going to raise my kids as a single parent. Being a full time single parent was a hell of a lot better then a parent who was out dating and bringing men in and out of her and her kids lives. My Mom had a fit at first. She grew up thinking women should be married and raise kids. I stuck to my guns. I also wasn't raising statistics. My son is 21 and my daughter is 16. It sucks...I am not going to lie. I have given both of them male father figures, but I am still single. I have made sure I am ALWAYS there, every football game, every dance competition, recital, hockey game, etc. I am ALWAYS there. They have me and will always have me. They never had to worry about splitting their time with me. My sister divorced and she and her Ex share custody, she also has dated A LOT of men....several of them have been abusive. Her kids have seen that. I love my nieces, but they have talked to my daughter and both have said they wished their Mom was like me and didn't date. Who am I to say that my way is the right way. Getting back in the dating pool now at 50, it doesn't sound appealing at all. I am set in my ways, and well, there isn't much of a selection. But, would I go back and change my choice?

I don't think I could remarry if my SO died. We love who we love, for reasons we cannot comprehend. You lost part of yourself, and no one can ever fill that void. Your mother is completely in the wrong here. I had a stepmother who insisted I called her mom, and I despise her, to this day for it.

Some people think it's the worst thing in the world to be single, especially if you have kids.  Your mom might mean well but that doesn't mean she's right.  Do not let anyone push you into something you don't want or feel ready for.  That's not fair to you or to anyone you might become involved with. \n\n And for goodness sakes DO NOT start dating if the primary reason is to find a new mom for your kids.
