I also lost a lot of my memories of him because I suffered a TBI in the same accident my dad died in. My mom remarried within 18 months of dad dying.

The most important thing for your children is to have a loving parent who will care for them and support them as the grow.  If you are doing that, then you are being a good father.  You do not need to get married again just to give them a mother.  They have a mother, unfortunately she passed, but she will always be their mother.  Maybe one day you will decide you are ready to meet someone else, but that day if it comes doesn't have to be now.\n\n\nYour mother needs to stop lying to herself, her remarrying so quickly was in her best interests, not yours.  All you did was state how you feel, if she didn't like hearing the truth, it still doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA\n\nIt needed saying.\n\nThis sub and the relationships subs are *swamped* with awful problems that were  caused by parents re-marrying far too soon after a divorce or bereavement. It seems to fuck up the kids far more than being short of one parent does.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't just out of the blue say you didn't want to be like her, she pushed and you responded. She said that her remarrying had been the best thing for you, and you would have been lying if you had agreed. \n\nI'd like to think she'll quit pushing so hard after that conversation, but she probably won't given her parting statement that you aren't being a good father. \n\nI really hope that her anger isn't partly because she married someone she didn't love just to give you a \"dad,\" and now she's finding that you never saw him that way.", "NTA.\n\nYou are in absolutely no way required to remarry or date just to give a mom figure to your kids. You're perfectly capable of being a father to them and providing the support they need without a mother. What your mom said is very insensitive to you and while what you said may have hurt her, she kept pushing you and now knows where you stand.\n\nYou aren't a bad father by any means for grieving the mother of your children.", "NTA and as you said everyone is different. Ask the kids if they want a mother in their life and if the answer is positive and if you feel like dating, you can consider the option. If not, there's no point in pushing adult decisions on their lives. They would be happier to have more time with you and for respecting their decision if they want to just continue the way life is. I am sure their mother's memories would continue to be with them and with all the friends and relatives, they would be fine. You mom is clearly trying to push her views on you and you have every right to push back and decide what's good for you and the kids. Also how you feel towards your step father is upto to you and I am of the opinion that everyone can decide for themselves how they feel towards others.", "NTA, your mother, definitely one... Both for continually badgering you, and for getting butthurt when you snapped at her.  Bringing a new stepmother into your family is not necessarily beneficial to your kids.  I'd bet money that your mom remarrying so soon, was NOT for your benefit, but for hers. \n\nYou take all the time that you want to grieve.  There's no set limit on how long someone should.  I can totally understand where you're coming from with your view on it.  Worry about your children, not your mom.", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019re doing your best to be a good father to your kids, and them having a loving and supportive parent to help them get through something as formative as losing their mother is far more important than the arbitrary idea of a nuclear family. Kids don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d a mother and father, what they need is love, and it sounds like you\u2019ve got that covered just fine on your own. \n\nYour mother is projecting onto you and trying to enforce her ideals onto you, an adult with children, is out of line. It sounds like you kept things civil and are just looking out for yourself and your kids. You\u2019re not a bad father for making different choices than her.\n\nSending love and support!", "NTA. Is your stepdad aware that your mom (apparently) only married him to \"give\" you \"another\" father?! Because that sounds horrible -- I can't imagine living it -- and you are definitely NOT a bad father just because you don't share her delusional viewpoint.", "NTA and I am sorry you have suffered such deep losses.\n\nPersonally, I think you are handling the loss of your wife in an incredibly mature and sensitive way. You are right. Willow will never be replaced, and anyone you meet in the future will be taking on a role that involves that fact. That will be decided when and if you are ready to date again.\n\nYour mother wanted to make herself feel better. It wasn't really about finding a father for you. The fact that she is pushing so hard without respecting your decision is showing her own insecurities.\n\nIt takes a village to raise children, even more so when a parent dies. Keep loving them and keep sharing memories of their mother. If someone special comes along and wants to be a part of the family, they can then share those memories with her and make new ones together.", "So so so NTA. When will parents get it through their heads that their children are separate humans with different lives? Good grief. I'm so sorry for all of this.", "NTA. You are communicating in so many ways that you do not agree that her marrying your stepdad was the right decision for you. It is so frustrating that your mother does not hear you, and keeps living in the reality where she selflessly provided you with a father.", "NTA. You are communicating in so many ways that you do not agree that her marrying your stepdad was the right decision for you. It is so frustrating that your mother does not hear you, and keeps living in the reality where she selflessly provided you with a father.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised by your mothers view that a step parent is bad, and worse that you have to slot someone in to replace their mother. I don\u2019t think your mum is being malicious, honestly she sounds like she has still not come to terms with her own circumstances and sees you repeating what she did as approval. I imagine it was incredibly difficult for her at the time knowing what was right. However, that doesn\u2019t mean she can place her own issues on you. \n\nI\u2019d feel very uncomfortable entering someone\u2019s life with expectation of being a \u2018mother replacement.\u2019 I just wouldn\u2019t do it. I think it\u2019s unhealthy. Of course you may meet someone one day, and your children may come to regard her as a mother, but that still isn\u2019t a replacement. \nMy dads mum remarried after his dad died. He was 8. He was never allowed to talk about his dad as this was his new dad. A forced new family. It affected him a great deal throughout his own life. \nYou are doing what is right for you and your children. The idea that a child must have two parents is naive. You sound like a wonderful dad. Keep doing what you are doing.", "NTA. Needed saying. I'm so sorry for your loss x", "OP, you're NTA, but here me out. I lost my mum when I was 10 (2 years after my parents divorced). My dad never remarried and didn't even start dating until I was as dad put it \"big enough and ugly enough to look after myself\" so 17/18 and I think it was only his way of preparing for the loneliness that would come when I eventually moved out and started my own family (although now in my 30s he still calls me at least once a day sometimes more). \n\nWhile he stayed single, that didn't stop him from meeting women and becoming friends, and a few of them he became close enough with to introduce me to as friends but more importantly as \"mother like figures\". They were all strong, independent women who were willing to help me in any way I needed. Luckily for my dad between mums death and moving in with him, I was living with my aunt and uncle (nightmare), and that was where I had gotten my first period, so he was able to avoid those awkward conversations and I would just put my pads in the shopping trolley when we went shopping without any discussion.\n\nI will be one of the first to admit that while I did end up calling two of those women \"mum\", they weren't the same as the real deal, but while they weren't the same, I was still greatful I had them in my life.\n\nI hope my story can help you come to terms with the idea of finding a middle ground between \"not replacing Willow\" and your mother's insistence that the kids \"need a new mum\". One of the women my dad introduced me to (one of my adopted mums) was also in a similar set of shoes to my dad (divorced and widowed- dad agreed to the divorce despite still being in love with my mum) and she was also able to be someone for dad to talk to and build a friendship with and they were close right up until she died unexpectedly from cancer 4years ago.", "First let me say one widower to another, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. This a tricky one tbh. In some ways yes, in others no. One of the things I\u2019ve learned is that while people may have the best of intentions their ability to properly communicate those are usually lacking. I do believe that your mom has the best of intentions if not for you at least her grandchildren. At the same time your children do not need a replacement mom. They have a mom. That\u2019s not saying that seeing you in a healthy relationship or having a motherly figure , that\u2019s not auntie or grandma, wouldn\u2019t be beneficial for the kids. I say tell mom that she just needs to back off about it and just give it time. No time doesn\u2019t fix anything you just get used to it. But no one knows what or who the future holds for us.

Yes it is hard.    I would consider going NC with your mother for a time until she can accept that your re not ready to date, or to bring someone new into your children's lives\n\nNTA", "Exactly. The kids have cousins, uncles, aunts, friends, they have each other, they have a father, they have grandfathers and grandmothers. A grandmother can be a mother to her grandchildren. Theoretically, after the mother comes the grand-mother and thus the mother word in her role. MOTHER. NTA I've seen so many grandmothers raising their grandchildren as their children.", "If you rush off to replace Willow, you validate your mum's decision to do the same. For what it is worth, I think you should be open to the idea of remarrying for the right reasons. When you are ready and happen to meet someone who gets along with your kids, doesn't consider herself in competition with Willow's memory and generally makes you happy, I think you should be open to the idea of dating that person. But rushing off to replace and erase your childrens' mother out of some misguided notion they need a new mum is a terrible reason to get married. I don't want to be nasty but your mum did it for herself because she couldn't cope with being alone. But that is too ugly a truth so she pretties it up by convincing herself she did it for your sake. It probably feels like a criticism that you are handling parenting alone. I actually don't think your mum is a monster. Parenting is really hard and getting remarried was probably the right decision for her. But she is now making your choices about her and it is okay to draw a boundary and tell her to stop. NTA.", "If you're not ready to date then don't date. Do not deny yourself romantic love in the future because you are still young but no need to rush it. Your mom is pushing this because if you find a new romantic relationship soon and get married then it justifies her decision to marry so soon after your dad's death. Definitely NTA. She did what she felt was right back then and right now you are doing the same.", "Children don\u2019t need a \u201cfather\u201d or a \u201cmother\u201d, they need people who love them and put them first.

Just take a look around this sub, it\u2019s full of failed blended families and horrifying step parents. \n\nI hope you and your children continue to heal. Take care of yourself and them. NTA", "That is something my therapist told me. She said that wanting to date again and being ready to date again are very personal things. That I should take my time, trust myself and my ability to recognize my own emotions, and know that neither choice is wrong. She told me some people fall into such extremes that it becomes unhealthy. She said remarrying isn't healthy or unhealthy just like choosing never to isn't. But it's when you are rigid to the point of judging others and forcing feelings on yourself that either becomes unhealthy and something you need to work on.\n\nI don't think my mom will ever accept that. I'm not even mad at her for making the choice. But it is frustrating to have it shoved down my throat so forcefully again 20+ years later.", "I think some of it comes from the whole kids are resilient thing and also the idea that all kids long for a mom and a dad. Those two things together mean people will often assume or convince themselves their kid wants and needs a new parent and that the death of their parent or divorce of their parents is something that will be better without doing anything, and that the way to speed it up is to give them back what they are missing. But not every kid craves that. My best friend was raised by a single mom who was a single mom by choice. Never once did he talk about needing a dad or wishing he had one. I didn't crave a new dad when I lost mine and honestly, I hated that it was assumed he was my dad because I was so young at the time.\n\nTherapy for me would have helped make it less upsetting. But I remember feeling bad that my mom had moved on so fast and expected me to do the same. I don't hate her or my stepdad for it. But I will never say it was what I wanted or needed either.", "There could be some element of that. I don't think she necessarily went out looking for a second spouse who was exactly what she wanted, but more, who would be willing to become an instant dad to the child she already had. There are some things in my mom and stepdad's relationship that makes me suspect they aren't great as a couple exactly, but he was eager to be my dad and they have children together now so I don't know that the marriage will exactly end. But I don't know that my mom would have chosen him as husband number two if I didn't exist or if I had been \"too old\" in her mind to replace dad.", "She's always had this idea that the only way to heal healthily is to essentially replace the deceased parent with someone living. I think it goes back to the whole idea some people have that a mom and a dad are needed and every kid wants and needs both. She truly believes that seeing the stepparent as new mom or new dad somehow fixes the kid or takes away the grief for their deceased parent. I think deep down she's always had to acknowledge on some level that my stepdad was always my stepdad and not my dad, because I have never called him dad. But that she still convinced herself that I did consider him my new dad and that I had moved on from my dad to her husband. He has come to terms with not being my dad, I believe, better than mom has. But he married my mom expecting he'd be my dad from the beginning.", "I'm sorry for your loss as well. I think my mom likely has a lot of feelings because I am making a different choice than she did, and you are right that her intentions are probably good, if not driven somewhat by fear of facing the reality of how I feel about her remarrying.", "It seems like you are trying your best to do what's right for both yourself and your children.  Your therapist sounds like she is very good.  As she said, trust yourself.", "> I think some of it comes from the whole kids are resilient thing and also the idea that all kids long for a mom and a dad. \n\nYup. There is some truth in each of those statements, but only some. They are not infinitely resilient, and two parents could almost be seen as a  luxury not a necessity. (Heck, even orphans do OK.)\n\n\n>people will often assume or convince themselves \n\n... that the kid conveniently wants exactly what they themself want.\n\n(However, do be sure you are not making the same mistake!)\n\n--\n\nQuite apart from all this, telling *anyone* that they need to marry is tactless, tasteless, rude, inappropriate, disgusting, intrusive... and to do it to a new widower is appalling, cruel, and dismissive.\n\nMum needs to go in time out for a little while.", "Honestly if it were me I might try to gently make that point to her. That maybe she\u2019s upset bc she made certain decisions and made sacrifices that came along with those choices, and is taking it personally that you are making different choices jn a similar (but not the same) situation. And that you understand why it might be hurtful if part of your decision making process was your experience living through the natural consequences of her choices but ultimately her choices were hers to live with and yours are yours. She doesn\u2019t get to use your life choices to validate her own decades later.", "I actively make sure I don't make the same mistakes with my kids. It's my goal that they can always be honest with me and that I understand that sometimes our needs and wants will be different and that it's okay.", "NTA. Take your time. Brining someone new to children after a massive loss is not a small thing and should not be treated lightly. Many children suffer when step parents are not who their bio parent expected them to be. And some kids can never find it in them to accept step parents fully. Sure, there are also many who managed to strike the jackpot, but a lot of work needs to be put in. Your mother needs to respect your decision. You are doing great so far.", "NTA and OP, if you ever happen to find someone you want to share life with again, and your kids don't see that person as a mother, that is more than okay. They have a mum who loved them, cherished them, and they have a surviving parent who keeps the memory of their mother alive and important. \n\nSometimes kids end up viewing stepparents just the same as bio parents but that happens naturally and without pressure and not by trying to erase the memory of the lost parent. \n\nYour kids are loved, safe, they have family, and they know they had mum who loved them. You're being a good father. \n\nIf you ever find love again, if you want that, let your children take the lead on what they want to call or feel for that person. If that person is supporting and loving and accepting of them and not trying to replace their mother, that will be enough. If you never remarry and never bring another person into the family that will be enough as well. \n\nYour kids don't need a replacement mother. They need you.", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re a good dad to put your kids first. \n\nI don\u2019t have the exact words and I\u2019m afraid if I did, I\u2019d be banned, but it seems that so many parents, who either divorce or lose their signifying other, want or even need to move on very quickly\u2026 irregardless of how it would affect their kids. Basically, it seems that these kinds of parents care about their own needs and comfort (need for companionship, both physical and mental) first and since children are often deemed as quick-adapting, somehow it translates as \u201cthe kids will be fine, but I won\u2019t be\u201d. And then years later, some of them end here, full of anger and resentment towards their remaining parent for substituting their missing parent asap. \n\nYour mom did what she wanted or needed to do at the time.

I still only have one dad.\n\nIf I ever find myself wanting someone else or ready to be with someone else, my kids feelings will 100% be respected and they will get to decide the relationship. The if is important to me because I can say right now I have no interest in another romantic relationship. That might stay the same or it might change with time. But one thing I would never do is force it.\n\nIt is a relief that the kids have more than me. My in-law's are fantastic and so are some of Willow's friends.

She even keeps their father in their life without clinging to the past. You remind me of her; you can be an excellent, loving parent without needing to remarry. \n\nIf it helps, my parents are similar to topics about marriage and children. It's mostly because they are also in their seventies and grew up in a time period when women couldn't financially survive without marriage.
