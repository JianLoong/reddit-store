We coparent but are not friends nor like each other. He\u2019s with the women he had an affair with so I can never get past that. They also have a three year old conceived while we were still together.\n\nWhenever I send my sons over to their dads I give them a lot of their belongings that they usually bring home. The standard of living at their dads is a bit lower so the stuff they have is nicer than what he has for them. He makes a lot of money he's just more frugal and doesn't spend lavishly. I do and I spoil my sons rotten. I don't leave out their brother, I have no issue with him and have love for him as he's innocent and I don't want any tension between the brothers. I have gifted him things in the past to his parents with no issue from either.\n\nMy MIL is a massive fur collector and shes gifted both my sons fur blankets that they adore and sleep with every night. The fur is so soft I swear it helps you fall asleep. I noticed the past few weeks my oldest sons blanket was missing and I asked him about it. He said he gave it to his little brother to keep because it helps him sleep at nap time. I thought that was really sweet of him to think of and do on his own and almost cried tears of joy until he continued saying sadly he misses it and wishes he could get it back but his stepmom said he has enough things and that without the blanket her son refuses to sleep.\n\nThat shocked me. I don\u2019t think its in her place to tell my son that he has enough things and guilt him into leaving the blanket. I asked him if he asked for it back and he said he has a few times but she says no. I was very angry but decided to react as nicely as I thought (apparent Im the asshole though?) and asked my MIL if I could buy a blanket from her as I know she had at least one more and she asked why since the other two were gifts and I explained the situation and she gave me the other blanket as a gift for my sons brother and even asked for his initials for the stitched monogram.\n\nAt their next week with their dad I came inside with the blanket and spoke with their stepmother and ex husband. I told them that I don\u2019t appreciate that my son was guilted into leaving his blanket behind which I guess my ex had no clue about. She said she never guilted him and denied that she refused to give it back and that he chose to gift it and was getting irate with me. I gave them the blanket I brought for their son and told my son to go grab his blanket and he ran off. My ex apologized but she was getting upset saying I was making a show to buy their son a blanket and take the other back to make them look bad parents for not buying unneeded expensive things and like \u201cthieves\u201d and Im an asshole for just not presenting it as a gift and falsely accusing them of withholding it from my son and that he willingly gifted it and its bad manners to ask for it back.
