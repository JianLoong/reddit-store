Really, you are a rare breed and an example to us all. After what these people have put you through you don\u2019t owe them anything.   \n\n\nYet, you put your hurt aside, nurtured a loving relationship between your kids and their brother, have decided to be sweet to a child who who no fault of his own came into this world through an act of utter betrayal, and have maintained a cool and level head while dealing with people hellbent on making your life less pleasant.   \n\n\nYou are a good egg. You are a good mother. You shall be the first poster that that I bestow an award upon. I knew I was saving those few coins I have for something.   \n\n\nI hope life is good to you. Your kindness to this little boy has touched my heart. NTA", "NTA - She's upset because you shined light on the situation & made it transparent to the adults. I like your classy approach gifting the son with a touch of the South, \"Well, Bless Your Heart.\"\n\nHer rational is weak. Kids take one another's things frequently and it is not 'bad manners' to settle the score. She is defensive and wants what she wants.", "NTA\n\nGood on you Mama Bear, always have your son's backs", "NTA.  Sounds like step mom is jealous of her husband\u2019s oldest children.  Good on you for being the grownup.", "NTA\n\nInfo: Why hadn't your MIL gifted her grandson a blanket already?", "NTA. My nephew did something similar. Gave a toy away to a kid who loved it. He immediately regretted it, but instead of getting the toy back I reinforced his good deed, and brought him another. You were 100% within your right, but make sure your son keeps that heart off gold.  Way more valuable than any blanket.", "Nta you did the best possible thing to deal with the situation. She's just upset she got caught", "NTA you went above and beyond.", "NTA. The blanket was your son's and his stepmother had no right to take it from him. Good for you for sticking up for him.", "NTA. I think you handed this beautifully. Your ex's wife's not so much.", "NTA\n\nYou handled that with maturity. \n\nStep-mom is a def AHole", "NTA - And I wouldn't care what this woman thinks of me if I was you.", "NTA.  You fixed the situation.", "NTA\n\n\nYour son didn't want to give the \"gift\".  The blanket was replaced  with another for the other child. Step mother is going to have to find a way to be alright with it. \n\nI have a personal dislike for that term\"half brother\" but still, NTA.", "NTA - You were standing up for your son who was unable to do so himself. He is young and doesn't understand coercion.\n\nIt sounds to me like his SM feels some jealousy/inferiority about not providing the same environment at their home. (Not that there is anything wrong with the environment they do provide!) Instead of having a conversation with you she internalizes it.\n\nYou tried to come up with a solution that would work for all of the children; this is what a **good parent** does. You didn't want the blanket back until you realized your child regretted parting with it. It wasn't a power move on your part by any means.\n\nI would advise trying to handle the discussion a bit better next time, however. If you start with an accusation people are likely to become defensive - no matter how true the accusation. When children are involved it's best to avoid defensive confrontation because no progress will be made.\n\nExplaining that your son is very empathetic, but regretted giving away the blanket would have been best. *\"He didn't want to disappoint you by asking for it back\"* is a lot less confrontational than *\"He felt coerced into giving it.\"* \n\nNot faulting you for it, of course! You did what you thought was right and said it as upfront as you knew how.", "NTA \u2014 Your son was letting him borrow it, not permanently have it. I lost a good friend in my 20s for not giving back a borrowed, signed book once (I genuinely lost it XD). Just because you\u2019re family doesn\u2019t mean the mom is entitled to keep the blanket that was meant to be borrowed.\n\nAnd just because you are more frugal doesn\u2019t mean that you get to take back a gift. What?! Who does that.\n\nIt was kind of you to get a new blanket for their kid, not necessary. You went above & beyond. They\u2019re just angry because you\u2019re so obviously the good guy. Good on you! On this one, no need to even further discuss this with them or apologize for your words or anything. Just move on in the knowledge that you\u2019re NTA and did nothing wrong\u2026.

Unbelievable!", "NTA. Your ex got what he deserved in that woman! Yikes!", "NTA", "TLDR: Your ex makes good money but chooses to save rather than spend.  You spend a bit more lavishly.  Neither lifestyle infringes upon the other.  \n\nThis feels like you have inadvertently stepped into a fight between Ex and his wife, that being that \"his\" money buys nicer things for his first family than his second family and SM has some jealousy about the nicer things your children have.  \n\nBack away slowly and just watch if other things of your son's have been \"gifted.\"\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
