I had left my parents' home in Vermont and ended up working as a maid in a hotel in Miami. I am not ashamed, but it was not nice. It was there where I met a black man named Oscar, he wasn't rich or anything but he offered me certain security and love in a moment I was feeling really alone and hopeless. We moved in  together and I got pregnant. Our baby was born and Oscar named her Tayesha, I was ok with that name at the time.\n\nWhen she was only 3, Oscar was arrested for drug trafficking and sentenced to 15 years in prison. I decided to not let that destroy my life or my daughter's future. It was hard but I got a new job as a waitress and did my best to rise my girl alone, until I reconnected with my parents and they started to help us more. At first I felt bad for Oscar but I came to realise that he only had himself to blame for how he ended up. Not only he break the law but he also could have put me and our daughter in danger. I stop calling her by her birth name because it reminded me too much of Oscar and I start calling her Taylor, I didn't legally changed her name.\n\nI never had any contact with Oscar after he was arrested or tell Taylor the truth about her father. I always wanted to tell her when she would be mature enough and at some point I decided that moment would be at 16. So, when after her last birthday in february, i explained to her the whole story. She was shocked, of course.\n\nAt first, she didn't do anything about it but a few months later she said that she wanted to talk to his father. She had research about how to arrange a call with an inmate in Florida and was decided to do it. I didn't like the idea at all but didn't stop her. I don't know how the call actually went or what did the say to each other, Taylor didn't say much about it and I didn't really want to know. She seemed to be happy about it.\n\nShe said that she planned yo talk with her father again at some point and send him a letter. A few days after the call, she told me that she would prefer for me and others to start calling her Tayesha again. I thought that was very dumb, because she didn't have any memory of being call that when she was baby. Also she had always known that was her legal name but never complained about being called Taylor. I ignored her and keep calling her Taylor. She didn't like that and we have been arguing about this issue a lot. My father agrees with me (althougt he had mostly avoid the conflict by just calling her \"darling\" as he usually does) but my mom thinks I should respect my daughter's preference regarding how is she named. My daughter has recently insinuated that me not wanting to call her by her \"real\" and \"black\" name is racist somehow, which I think it is beyond stupid. She had never cared about being \"black\" in her life. Race has never been an issue in our family. I can't avoid thinking all this is because something Oscar said to her. \n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1669582997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6cj31/aita_for_not_wanting_to_call_my_daughter_by_her/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He loved you and Tayesha? \nWas he dealing to make ends meet and provide for you? Have you explored the reality of the judicial system and harsher sentencing for Black people?\n \nI understand wanting to end things with him, and doing what you need to for your survival and the survival of your kid, but to completely abandon him to jail and not let your kid know anything? That\u2019s shitty. \n\nDid you ever reach out to his family so that she could connect with any of his relatives? \n\nI can\u2019t imagine what joy it gave him to have contact with his daughter and what a relief it was for her to find that piece of her own identity. \n\nJust do her the honor of calling her Tayesha, honor her as a young Black woman and all that it means for her. \nIf you don\u2019t work on this and support her in this way, you are at risk of losing her trust and a future relationship with her. \nMy wife went through something similar with her mom and in her 40\u2019s is still in therapy working on her anger and sadness over how her mom consciously separated her from racial and cultural identity. She loves her mom, but has a lot of pain over what was hidden from her until she was nearly an adult.\n\nYou have a chance to make it right with your kid, she\u2019s inviting you to show that you care about her as not just your daughter but your Black Daughter. It\u2019s a bare minimum to call her by the name her father gave her.

Now you think it's \"dumb\" for her to want to go by her birth name?!?! Just do what she wants. By refusing to do so (no matter what your reason), you're risk her disowning you as soon as she turns 18. \n\nIt's quite obvious you have little to no respect for her. Her feeling is \"dumb\"... Real nice, mom......", "You think your daughter\u2019s feelings about her own name and her racial identity are \u201cvery dumb\u201d and \u201cbeyond stupid.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right about the racial overtones here. I would think about your prejudices quickly before you really alienate your *non-white daughter*.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Just because she never cared about being Black in her life doesn't mean that she can't start to care. Wanting to explore that part of her heritage is perfectly normal. Maybe speaking to Oscar sparked that interest in her, maybe not. But it's not your place to forbid it. She's 16. Exploring her identity is natural at that age and to be expected.\n\nAnd yes, it is at least a little racist of you to keep that from her and call it stupid. Probably more than a little racist, really. You want her to deny a part of herself and you dismiss its importance just because you don't understand it.", "YTA. It\u2019s her name. You need to respect her wishes and call her her true name.", "YTA - If someone chooses a name, you use it.", "YTA, and you really need to re-evaluate your ideas about race/racism. i can already tell your daughter is/will be psychologically affected by this from your word choice.", "YTA. Call her by the name she told you to call her. And I\u2019m so sick of the white parents of mixed kids saying \u201crace was never an issue in my house\u201d like duh, no shit. But every time your daughter leaves her house to go into the world, she is seen and viewed and TREATED as a black woman. Read a fucking book and stop with the microagressions in your own home.

That's -it-.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t really matter if it IS because of something Oscar told her. Your daughter is old enough to have a preference on her name, and you should honor that preference. It costs you nothing and will let a young girl who has just suddenly learned a LOT of things about her father and herself feel a sense of agency.", "Info please when you say you never told her the truth, what did you tell her about her father prior to 16?", "YTA Whether you like it or not, your daughter is black. You don\u2019t get to dictate what name she goes by and your comment about \u201cshe\u2019s never cared about being black\u201d before is gross and horrifying.", "YTA.

You never changed it, she knew it, which means you should've known that at some point she might choose to use that name again. Deal with it.", "YTA. She told you her preference. You should call her by the name she wants to be called by.", "YTA. It's her name and she wants you to use it, respect that.", "YTA. How would you like it if your parents divorced and your Mom decided to call you something else because your name reminded her too much of her ex and all the shit he put her through? You wouldn't like it either. It's HER name. And if you keep refusing to call her by her name, don't be surprised when she stops answering to you until you can call her what she wants to be called.", "YTA. She is old enough to know what she wants to be called. Show her that respect, please.", "YTA. This is about your daughter's name. HER name, HER identity. \n\nMy nephew was named after my brother who passed away before my nephew was born. We used his middle name when he was growing up, but as a teenager, he decided he wanted to be called by his first name. The change was difficult at first because we weren't used to it, but we never thought it was a \"dumb\" decision because it was HIS decision as to what name he identified with, not our decision. \n\nDon't die on this hill, OP. She is old enough now to make more adult decisions. If you continue to push, you risk losing her.", "YTA. Race has never been an issue in your family? You are obviously wrong about that and your daughter knows it. Call her by her actual name.", "YTA. Sorry, I can see how you might not perceive or have intended this to be racist, but her feelings about her heritage and name is personal and important to your daughter. You like it or not she has the right to be in touch with her father, have a preference with her name etc. While it might be hard for you, I suggest you be fully supportive of her as this entire situation is more of a shock than it is to you.", "YTA x2. Both for unofficially changing your child\u2019s name because you later decided it was \u201ctoo Black\u201d and for ignoring your daughter\u2019s request now. I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019re white, or at least not Black. There\u2019s nothing you can do about the past now, but if your daughter wants to go by her legal name (or any name) now you need to respect that.", "YTA plus a question - you said she doesn\u2019t have a memory of being called Tayesha, but also that you  never legally changed it to Taylor. Doesn\u2019t she has to use her real docs and therefore name when signing up at school?", "YTA\nShes old enough to decide what she'd like to be called and you're breaking her boundary.", "YTA - As people have said, if she tells you she wants to you use her birth name, you do use that.\n\nAnd intentionally or not, you have whitewashed her name and tried to erase some of her history, personal or otherwise.", "YTA! Such a big AH! Your daughter has always cared about being Black, I bet, even if she didn't explicitly bring it up to you. Most mixed kids do, but often hide it from their white families because they don't feel safe.\n\nThe fact that you are calling her birth name a \"Black\" name is evidence of the racism here. It doesn't mean you're a white hood wearing terrorist. But you definitely have some prejudices and hangups that you're not acknowledging to yourself even as you act on them.\n\nRespect your daughter's choices. Learn how to unpack your privilege knapsack. Maybe get some counseling. Cuz right now you're on the road to having a daughter who will go LC or NC with you down the line.", "YTA: all the racial dynamics aside (big job, I know)--it costs you nothing to call your daughter by the name she choose.  My parents don't call me by my birth name because my mother hates it (long story) so I get called by a name that's not legally mine. Every year in school it was this big dumb thing to explain to the teachers to not call me the name I was enrolled by but to call me something else.  All my teachers complied because, you know, they respected it.  \n\n When I was a kid my parents told me I could change my name from my legal name that they hate when I turned 18.  When I turned 18 I'd spent years coming up with a name that felt like ME (it was my grandmother's name, actually) and....they told me it was too expensive and would be too complicated so...got that taken away from me, too. The downside is, I feel like I have no name.  I have names I respond to but I don't FEEL like either name (my legal name or the name my parents called me instead) feels real to me. When I meet new people, I have a moment where I try to figure out what name to refer to myself by and if they're friends of my parents, they will automatically call me by the name my parents forced on me.  I feel like I'm two people, at least. Or no one at all. \n\nYour daughter is probably where I was when I was 16, thinking of a name that FIT and has probably, like 16 year old me, been dealing with this cognitive dissonance of a 'name that's not her name' with every school year, every report card, etc.  Let her have a better resolution than my parents did.  It may hurt you she's named by the guy you'd rather forget, but consider it giving your daughter a chance to make something wonderful from that name, instead of deciding like my parents did, that it's already poison.", "I am mixed Black and you're a HIGE Asshole and a huge reason why being mixed is so fucking hard yta", "YTA. Changing it in the first place was racist. You wouldn\u2019t have done that if Oscar was Irish, German, Scottish, Welsh, or French.", "YTA\n\nShe's identifying with the other half of herself and you're literally blaming it on her father instead of recognizing that she's biracial. \n\nShe's right, you are being racist.", "YTA, and are racist. Nothing wrong with being named Tayesha or any \u201cblack sounding name\u201d\n\n\u2014signed, a person with a black sounding name", "YTA.\n\n>> That he had abandoned the family.\n\nSo, not only did you try to erase her father from her existence by changing her name, you spent years *lying* to your child, leading her to believe that her father had intentionally left without any thought to you or her. That\u2019s so incredibly damaging. \n\n>> She never cared about being \u201cblack\u201d\n\nI can guarantee you that she has spent many years caring about being Black. It\u2019s part of her identity, no matter how hard you try to erase it. \n\nYour daughter has asked you to call her by her real name. Try to muster up some basic human decency and do so.", "YTA big time and you sound really immature.", "YTA\n\n\"Race is has never been an issue\" is basically you pretending she is white and treating her like she was white. \n\nSome people see that as the best way to not be racist, and I think \"I don't see colour\" was the way people would say they weren't racist at one point.\n\nBut in my opinion it helps nothing, doesn't address the issues black people face, and erases them in a way. People who don't see colour also always seem to be the people who don't think racist is as prevelant as it actually is. Why can't we just treat everyone the same regardless of skin colour? Because some people are racist and everyone else ignoring skin colour means their racism can't be addressed.\n\nShe *is* black and she will experience life differently as a result. If you keep pretending race isn't an issue then how will she deal with the institutional racist of the legal system? Racially motivated bullying? Caring for her hair? The list goes on and on.\n\nAnd yes it does seem racist that you won't use her \"black\" name.\n\nAnd yes it is her choice what she wants to be called. Your opinion on her reasoning is irrelevant.", "Um yea YTA and what a weird hill to die on. Are you really willing to lose the relationship you have with your daughter over a name? She is 16, which is old enough to have a preference on her name. \n\nAnd YOU ARE making it about race. You aren't saying her birth name or the name her father gave her. You are describing it as her black name. It's not her \"black\" name, it is her name.", "You didn't start calling her Taylor because her real name reminded you of her dad. You know damn well why you changed her name.", "YTA and racist to boot. When you label a name by race\u2026do the math. You make a point of saying \u201cblack\u201d man and \u201cblack\u201d name. Instead is saying a man of different ethnic background\u2026 Or I didn\u2019t like the name he gave her because it brought up bad memories, you specifically state a race. Who says her name was a \u201cblack\u201d name? Anyone can name their child that. I can\u2019t tell you how many Taylors I went to school with and work with that are black. Does it make Taylor a \u201cblack\u201d name too? Your daughter has every right to want to know about the man she shares blood with and his background. His mistake is not hers. She has a whole family out there she knows nothing about. Keep denying her and you will lose her! Quickly!", "YTA. It is like calling someone by their dead name after they have picked a new name. However in this case she is asking you to call her by her real name. Oscar my have broken your heart but you are breaking your daughter\u2019s by being disrespectful of her request. She is old enough to be told why you call her Taylor and perhaps you both can come to a compromise but if not, use the name she wants to be called.", "YTA. If your kid wants to be called \"Dinosaur,\" that's what you should call her, never mind that she wants to be called her actual name. Your kid is Black, and that's just how it is. Why wouldn't she care about it?", "This is going to sound rude, and I apologize for that, but your feelings don't come into the equation here. This is HER name HER identity, it doesn't matter if it reminds you of your ex, its her name and thats what she wants to be known as. She's 16? She's discovering herself and she needs your support, or she'll cut you out of her life entirely and find the support she needs elsewhere. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nWhen we give people names, they are gifts. What that person chooses to do with that gift is entirely up to them. They may embrace their given name as is, or they may prefer a nickname. They may even hate the name and change it - no different than returning an ugly sweater. \n\nWhat really makes this hard is that we impress so much into the gift of a name, we invest so much effort and emotion into it. It can be hard to let go of those feelings when someone really feels it is important to not go by that name. \n\nWe don't know why Tayesha has decided to go by Tayesha over Taylor, but those are her wishes. She has made the decision, and, if you wish to maintain a relationship with her, you need to respect her decision. \n\nI also want to point out your attention to her name being \"black.\" If this was as simple as just declining her name due to her father, you'd have simply said \"the name her father gave her.\" However, calling it a \"black\" name like that is somehow important makes me wonder if you have accidentally expressed to your daughter that a racial undertone : that it is the perceived \"blackness\" of the name and not the criminal background of her father that is the issue. \n\nAt any rate, you need to sit down and have an honest conversation with your daughter about this and respect HER wishes.", "It doesn't matter if she wanted to be called Sprinkletaint, you should always call someone their preferred name\n\nYTA", "YTA.

This is about your daughter. Stop centering your self and your feelings and start looking at ways to support her wholly. Of course she's going to want to connect with her Black side too.
