I had left my parents' home in Vermont and ended up working as a maid in a hotel in Miami. I am not ashamed, but it was not nice. It was there where I met a black man named Oscar, he wasn't rich or anything but he offered me certain security and love in a moment I was feeling really alone and hopeless. We moved in  together and I got pregnant. Our baby was born and Oscar named her Tayesha, I was ok with that name at the time.\n\nWhen she was only 3, Oscar was arrested for drug trafficking and sentenced to 15 years in prison. I decided to not let that destroy my life or my daughter's future. It was hard but I got a new job as a waitress and did my best to rise my girl alone, until I reconnected with my parents and they started to help us more. At first I felt bad for Oscar but I came to realise that he only had himself to blame for how he ended up. Not only he break the law but he also could have put me and our daughter in danger. I stop calling her by her birth name because it reminded me too much of Oscar and I start calling her Taylor, I didn't legally changed her name.\n\nI never had any contact with Oscar after he was arrested or tell Taylor the truth about her father. I always wanted to tell her when she would be mature enough and at some point I decided that moment would be at 16. So, when after her last birthday in february, i explained to her the whole story. She was shocked, of course.\n\nAt first, she didn't do anything about it but a few months later she said that she wanted to talk to his father. She had research about how to arrange a call with an inmate in Florida and was decided to do it. I didn't like the idea at all but didn't stop her. I don't know how the call actually went or what did the say to each other, Taylor didn't say much about it and I didn't really want to know. She seemed to be happy about it.\n\nShe said that she planned yo talk with her father again at some point and send him a letter. A few days after the call, she told me that she would prefer for me and others to start calling her Tayesha again. I thought that was very dumb, because she didn't have any memory of being call that when she was baby. Also she had always known that was her legal name but never complained about being called Taylor. I ignored her and keep calling her Taylor. She didn't like that and we have been arguing about this issue a lot. My father agrees with me (althougt he had mostly avoid the conflict by just calling her \"darling\" as he usually does) but my mom thinks I should respect my daughter's preference regarding how is she named. My daughter has recently insinuated that me not wanting to call her by her \"real\" and \"black\" name is racist somehow, which I think it is beyond stupid. She had never cared about being \"black\" in her life. Race has never been an issue in our family. I can't avoid thinking all this is because something Oscar said to her. \n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1669582997, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6cj31/aita_for_not_wanting_to_call_my_daughter_by_her/", "score": 3276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He loved you and Tayesha? \nWas he dealing to make ends meet and provide for you? Have you explored the reality of the judicial system and harsher sentencing for Black people?\n \nI understand wanting to end things with him, and doing what you need to for your survival and the survival of your kid, but to completely abandon him to jail and not let your kid know anything? That\u2019s shitty. \n\nDid you ever reach out to his family so that she could connect with any of his relatives? \n\nI can\u2019t imagine what joy it gave him to have contact with his daughter and what a relief it was for her to find that piece of her own identity. \n\nJust do her the honor of calling her Tayesha, honor her as a young Black woman and all that it means for her. \nIf you don\u2019t work on this and support her in this way, you are at risk of losing her trust and a future relationship with her. \nMy wife went through something similar with her mom and in her 40\u2019s is still in therapy working on her anger and sadness over how her mom consciously separated her from racial and cultural identity. She loves her mom, but has a lot of pain over what was hidden from her until she was nearly an adult.\n\nYou have a chance to make it right with your kid, she\u2019s inviting you to show that you care about her as not just your daughter but your Black Daughter. It\u2019s a bare minimum to call her by the name her father gave her.

Now you think it's \"dumb\" for her to want to go by her birth name?!?! Just do what she wants.

I would think about your prejudices quickly before you really alienate your *non-white daughter*.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Just because she never cared about being Black in her life doesn't mean that she can't start to care. Wanting to explore that part of her heritage is perfectly normal. Maybe speaking to Oscar sparked that interest in her, maybe not. But it's not your place to forbid it. She's 16. Exploring her identity is natural at that age and to be expected.\n\nAnd yes, it is at least a little racist of you to keep that from her and call it stupid. Probably more than a little racist, really. You want her to deny a part of herself and you dismiss its importance just because you don't understand it.", "YTA. It\u2019s her name. You need to respect her wishes and call her her true name.", "YTA - If someone chooses a name, you use it.", "YTA, and you really need to re-evaluate your ideas about race/racism. i can already tell your daughter is/will be psychologically affected by this from your word choice.", "YTA. Call her by the name she told you to call her. And I\u2019m so sick of the white parents of mixed kids saying \u201crace was never an issue in my house\u201d like duh, no shit. But every time your daughter leaves her house to go into the world, she is seen and viewed and TREATED as a black woman. Read a fucking book and stop with the microagressions in your own home.

That's -it-.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t really matter if it IS because of something Oscar told her. Your daughter is old enough to have a preference on her name, and you should honor that preference. It costs you nothing and will let a young girl who has just suddenly learned a LOT of things about her father and herself feel a sense of agency.", "Info please when you say you never told her the truth, what did you tell her about her father prior to 16?", "YTA Whether you like it or not, your daughter is black. You don\u2019t get to dictate what name she goes by and your comment about \u201cshe\u2019s never cared about being black\u201d before is gross and horrifying.", "YTA.

You never changed it, she knew it, which means you should've known that at some point she might choose to use that name again. Deal with it.", "YTA. She told you her preference. You should call her by the name she wants to be called by.", "YTA. It's her name and she wants you to use it, respect that.", "YTA. How would you like it if your parents divorced and your Mom decided to call you something else because your name reminded her too much of her ex and all the shit he put her through? You wouldn't like it either. It's HER name.

She is old enough to know what she wants to be called. Show her that respect, please.", "YTA. This is about your daughter's name. HER name, HER identity. \n\nMy nephew was named after my brother who passed away before my nephew was born. We used his middle name when he was growing up, but as a teenager, he decided he wanted to be called by his first name. The change was difficult at first because we weren't used to it, but we never thought it was a \"dumb\" decision because it was HIS decision as to what name he identified with, not our decision. \n\nDon't die on this hill, OP. She is old enough now to make more adult decisions. If you continue to push, you risk losing her.", "YTA. Race has never been an issue in your family? You are obviously wrong about that and your daughter knows it. Call her by her actual name.", "YTA. Sorry, I can see how you might not perceive or have intended this to be racist, but her feelings about her heritage and name is personal and important to your daughter. You like it or not she has the right to be in touch with her father, have a preference with her name etc. While it might be hard for you, I suggest you be fully supportive of her as this entire situation is more of a shock than it is to you.", "YTA x2. Both for unofficially changing your child\u2019s name because you later decided it was \u201ctoo Black\u201d and for ignoring your daughter\u2019s request now. I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019re white, or at least not Black. There\u2019s nothing you can do about the past now, but if your daughter wants to go by her legal name (or any name) now you need to respect that.", "YTA plus a question - you said she doesn\u2019t have a memory of being called Tayesha, but also that you  never legally changed it to Taylor. Doesn\u2019t she has to use her real docs and therefore name when signing up at school?", "YTA\nShes old enough to decide what she'd like to be called and you're breaking her boundary.", "YTA - As people have said, if she tells you she wants to you use her birth name, you do use that.\n\nAnd intentionally or not, you have whitewashed her name and tried to erase some of her history, personal or otherwise.", "YTA! Such a big AH! Your daughter has always cared about being Black, I bet, even if she didn't explicitly bring it up to you. Most mixed kids do, but often hide it from their white families because they don't feel safe.\n\nThe fact that you are calling her birth name a \"Black\" name is evidence of the racism here. It doesn't mean you're a white hood wearing terrorist. But you definitely have some prejudices and hangups that you're not acknowledging to yourself even as you act on them.\n\nRespect your daughter's choices. Learn how to unpack your privilege knapsack. Maybe get some counseling. Cuz right now you're on the road to having a daughter who will go LC or NC with you down the line.", "YTA: all the racial dynamics aside (big job, I know)--it costs you nothing to call your daughter by the name she choose.  My parents don't call me by my birth name because my mother hates it (long story) so I get called by a name that's not legally mine. Every year in school it was this big dumb thing to explain to the teachers to not call me the name I was enrolled by but to call me something else.  All my teachers complied because, you know, they respected it.  \n\n When I was a kid my parents told me I could change my name from my legal name that they hate when I turned 18.  When I turned 18 I'd spent years coming up with a name that felt like ME (it was my grandmother's name, actually) and....they told me it was too expensive and would be too complicated so...got that taken away from me, too. The downside is, I feel like I have no name.  I have names I respond to but I don't FEEL like either name (my legal name or the name my parents called me instead) feels real to me. When I meet new people, I have a moment where I try to figure out what name to refer to myself by and if they're friends of my parents, they will automatically call me by the name my parents forced on me.  I feel like I'm two people, at least. Or no one at all. \n\nYour daughter is probably where I was when I was 16, thinking of a name that FIT and has probably, like 16 year old me, been dealing with this cognitive dissonance of a 'name that's not her name' with every school year, every report card, etc.  Let her have a better resolution than my parents did.  It may hurt you she's named by the guy you'd rather forget, but consider it giving your daughter a chance to make something wonderful from that name, instead of deciding like my parents did, that it's already poison.", "I am mixed Black and you're a HIGE Asshole and a huge reason why being mixed is so fucking hard yta", "YTA. Changing it in the first place was racist. You wouldn\u2019t have done that if Oscar was Irish, German, Scottish, Welsh, or French.", "YTA\n\nShe's identifying with the other half of herself and you're literally blaming it on her father instead of recognizing that she's biracial. \n\nShe's right, you are being racist.", "YTA, and are racist.

That\u2019s so incredibly damaging. \n\n>> She never cared about being \u201cblack\u201d\n\nI can guarantee you that she has spent many years caring about being Black.

Try to muster up some basic human decency and do so.", "YTA big time and you sound really immature.", "YTA\n\n\"Race is has never been an issue\" is basically you pretending she is white and treating her like she was white. \n\nSome people see that as the best way to not be racist, and I think \"I don't see colour\" was the way people would say they weren't racist at one point.\n\nBut in my opinion it helps nothing, doesn't address the issues black people face, and erases them in a way. People who don't see colour also always seem to be the people who don't think racist is as prevelant as it actually is. Why can't we just treat everyone the same regardless of skin colour? Because some people are racist and everyone else ignoring skin colour means their racism can't be addressed.\n\nShe *is* black and she will experience life differently as a result. If you keep pretending race isn't an issue then how will she deal with the institutional racist of the legal system? Racially motivated bullying? Caring for her hair? The list goes on and on.\n\nAnd yes it does seem racist that you won't use her \"black\" name.\n\nAnd yes it is her choice what she wants to be called. Your opinion on her reasoning is irrelevant.", "Um yea YTA and what a weird hill to die on. Are you really willing to lose the relationship you have with your daughter over a name? She is 16, which is old enough to have a preference on her name. \n\nAnd YOU ARE making it about race. You aren't saying her birth name or the name her father gave her. You are describing it as her black name. It's not her \"black\" name, it is her name.", "You didn't start calling her Taylor because her real name reminded you of her dad. You know damn well why you changed her name.", "YTA and racist to boot. When you label a name by race\u2026do the math. You make a point of saying \u201cblack\u201d man and \u201cblack\u201d name. Instead is saying a man of different ethnic background\u2026 Or I didn\u2019t like the name he gave her because it brought up bad memories, you specifically state a race. Who says her name was a \u201cblack\u201d name? Anyone can name their child that. I can\u2019t tell you how many Taylors I went to school with and work with that are black. Does it make Taylor a \u201cblack\u201d name too? Your daughter has every right to want to know about the man she shares blood with and his background. His mistake is not hers. She has a whole family out there she knows nothing about. Keep denying her and you will lose her! Quickly!", "YTA. It is like calling someone by their dead name after they have picked a new name. However in this case she is asking you to call her by her real name. Oscar my have broken your heart but you are breaking your daughter\u2019s by being disrespectful of her request. She is old enough to be told why you call her Taylor and perhaps you both can come to a compromise but if not, use the name she wants to be called.", "YTA. If your kid wants to be called \"Dinosaur,\" that's what you should call her, never mind that she wants to be called her actual name. Your kid is Black, and that's just how it is. Why wouldn't she care about it?", "This is going to sound rude, and I apologize for that, but your feelings don't come into the equation here. This is HER name HER identity, it doesn't matter if it reminds you of your ex, its her name and thats what she wants to be known as. She's 16? She's discovering herself and she needs your support, or she'll cut you out of her life entirely and find the support she needs elsewhere. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nWhen we give people names, they are gifts. What that person chooses to do with that gift is entirely up to them. They may embrace their given name as is, or they may prefer a nickname. They may even hate the name and change it - no different than returning an ugly sweater. \n\nWhat really makes this hard is that we impress so much into the gift of a name, we invest so much effort and emotion into it. It can be hard to let go of those feelings when someone really feels it is important to not go by that name. \n\nWe don't know why Tayesha has decided to go by Tayesha over Taylor, but those are her wishes. She has made the decision, and, if you wish to maintain a relationship with her, you need to respect her decision. \n\nI also want to point out your attention to her name being \"black.\" If this was as simple as just declining her name due to her father, you'd have simply said \"the name her father gave her.\" However, calling it a \"black\" name like that is somehow important makes me wonder if you have accidentally expressed to your daughter that a racial undertone : that it is the perceived \"blackness\" of the name and not the criminal background of her father that is the issue. \n\nAt any rate, you need to sit down and have an honest conversation with your daughter about this and respect HER wishes.", "It doesn't matter if she wanted to be called Sprinkletaint, you should always call someone their preferred name\n\nYTA", "YTA.

Your relationship with baby daddy didn't work out, you can list whatever reasons you want but they are your reasons. Your daughter does not, has not and never will have the same relationship with her father that you had (even ifnyou guys had stayed together the relationship would never be the same...well it shouldn't be). She is half black, this is not news to you. Ignoring her dad's side is ignoring half of who she is, like other have commented.\n\nTo put this in a different perspective. People who adopt kids of other races (especially when adopted internationally) generally have the best relationship with their children when they do not ignore their heritage. Yes the Chinese girl that was born in China may have been adopted into a white family in the US, but the parents who incorporate her heritage into their lives (and thus hers) usually end up with better relationships than those who ignore where their kids came from and then act offended when the child wants to reconnect with that part of them.\n\nYour daughter wanting to be called by her given name, wanting to have a relationship of some kind with her father, and possibly wanting to know the other half of her identity has, and pay close attention, absolutely nothing to do with you or your relationship with her. Its about her. If you do not want to hurt and strain your relationship with her, you need to respect her. She is 16, not 3. She is almost an adult (legally) she has her own identity, she is her own person. She is not you, she is not your doll to play dress up with and act out a life that you want for you. \n\nIf you're having that big of an issue, have a talk with her. Ask her if she would be ok with a nick name (like Tay, which could potentially be a nickname for both of those names). That may be crossing some boundaries, but at the very minimum you're being honest about your hangups. You are at a pivotal moment in your daughters life. You may need to think back as to why you left home and lost contact with your parents when you were not much older than her. Was it because of some disrespect that came from them and their refusal to view you as your own person instead of their child? Put yourself in her shoes ask yourself how you would feel (and truly be honest with putting yourself in her mindset, not your mindset of how you think it should be). \n\nAs I said, this is very easily an issue that could cause you to loose your daughter entirely.

And for God\u2019s sake, get her in touch with some women and men from her heritage and culture! Get her in touch with her roots, ***or she will contact Oscar in order to try and meet that need***. \n\nYou buried a gigantic part of her identity, and somehow expect her not to have an identity crisis now she finds out her name isn\u2019t her name, and her ethnicity isn\u2019t her ethnicity, and her dad isn\u2019t her dad? Wild.\n\nThis moment is not about you. Your daughter\u2019s name is not about you. Her history, her culture *is not about you*. The trauma you have put her through *is not about you*. The suffering she is now a victim of because of who her father is ***is not about you***. **None of this is about you** so stop desperately trying to put yourself at the centre of it.", "I am half European white/Mexican American.  I can distinctly remember my white uncle on my mom's side telling me that I am White.  Like, trying to dismiss what I actually am.  Just bc someone is family doesn't mean they aren't racist AF.", "She needs therapy because her mom lied to her for years, not because her dad was a drug dealer (In the comments she admits that she told her daughter that the father abandoned them until she was 16). Her mother told her a story that convinced her that her black father did not want her. She probably internalized that story. Now that she knows that story is BS, she wants to form a bond with that side of her. And that doesn\u2019t even get into the pretty clear racism from OP. She started calling her Taylor to distance herself from her black side.\n\nAlso, regarding the influence of her father, OP would have to really go out of her way to be with a man for 4 years and not know he is a pretty significant drug trafficker. She either knew how he got money or didn\u2019t care how he got money. For OP to benefit from his activities and now pass moral judgment on the man is nothing but hypocrisy.", "Exactly. Maybe race isn\u2019t an issue for OP, but as mixed race child, race is ALWAYS a part of our lives. It\u2019s not something we have the luxury of ignoring.", "Yup, I legally changed my name in 2017 and my dad still won't use it and uses the wrong pronouns. He mostly uses a nickname with the occasional deadname sprinkled it, and it's fucking awful", "Huh, I never thought of this. I call everyone a vast array of \u201cpet names\u201d (honey, darling, babe, sweetheart, love, etc.) and I didn\u2019t realize it could be construed by some of my trans friends as a way to avoid using their real names. I need to be careful about that. Thank you for pointing this out!", "I mean do you really want your child to be in contact with their drug dealer father? Of all the fucked up shit this woman pulled that's far from the list imo", "I mean, the title to her freaking post mentions her daughter\u2019s *Black name,* so yeah\u2026.. Poor Tayesha. You know she\u2019s never had the space to explore being BIPOC in that household;  OP used \u201cTaylor\u201d as a tool to erase Tayesha\u2019s her ethnic identity.   \n\n\nYTA OP. You have a Black kid whether you like it or not; you probably didn\u2019t expose her to her roots so there\u2019s a chance she wasn\u2019t comfortable talking about race with you. I\u2019m mean, look how you changed her name when she was a toddler.", "I would beg my  kidney that she is", "Also very true, though that comes up much later in the post. Oscar being Black was the FIRST thing she specified about him right in the first couple of sentences, so we already knew. The rest just reinforced it to Brinks status.", "Oooh, yeah, I forgot about the title!  You're absolutely right it was there in the title. \n\nAs for the rest, OP is clearly ashamed of that part of her life through all her words and actions. Seems like Oscar would have been happy to have had contact with Tayesha the whole time but OP- as you note- tried to erase it.", "Why are you so mad lol? No one said it was special treatment.", "The only POC there were students at University of Vermont. Not a joke.", "No one is mad. It's just odd that mixed people feel like they're picked on in a unique way when everyone is picked on. Keep crying about It though.", "I should not have laughed as hard as I did at this comment", "I don't believe your intentions are bad, but regardless one's connection to their heritage is incrediblyyyy important. When teachers, coworkers etc try to give a \"easier\" nickname to someone that is easier or more comfortable for them to say, it low-key hurts as if your birth name wasn't good enough.", "YOU: NTA\n\nBut I hope you realize the conflict with making these two statements: \n\n\"AITA for not wanting to call my daughter by her \"black\" name?\"\n\nand\n\n\"Race has never been an issue in our family.\"\n\n\"Tayesha, your dad has his special name for you. My special name for you is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.

I  don't think this would happen these days (hopefully).", "YTA and it sounds like you have some biases about black people that you really need to address.", "\"Race has never been an issue\"\n\nThen OP proceeds to give a whole long explanation as to why she was in a position where she ended up dating a black man. \n\n>I am not ashamed, but it was not nice. It was there where I met a black man named Oscar, he wasn't rich or anything but he offered me certain security and love in a moment I was feeling really alone and hopeless.\n\nOP seems to really wanted to add  \"I mean, if I wasn't in this life circumstance I never would have dated a BLACK man, but it is what it is. I'm not really ashamed of it, I guess.\"\n\nNot like \"I met this guy who I fell in love with\" or \"I met a guy I really liked in Miami,\" but \"don't you see how vulnerable I was. And then I met a BLACK guy\"\n\nWhy is \"race is never an issue for me\" always followed with a \"but.\"\n\nYTA OP, on the off chance this isn't rage bait trolling.", "Say again that \"Taylor\" is a traditional European name and i throw you into a pool of boiling swiss cheese!\n\nOn the matter - i support the YTA. Its her name for christ sake!", "I really feel for this kid. Spunds like OP got mad at her child's father so tried to erase everything \"Black\" about her, even taking her name away. This is horrific to do to anyone, let alone your own child. I hope Tayesha gets the therapy she'll need after this, hopefully from a therapist who can appreciate the racial trauma her mother imposed on her.", ">And I\u2019m so sick of the white parents of mixed kids saying \u201crace was never an issue in my house\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s like, an whole corner of TikTok dedicated to black/white biracial kids discussing the issues and complexes they deal with that were caused by their white parent denying, if not actively denigrating their black identity. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t pretend to understand these issues as a fully black woman, but it\u2019s hard not to notice most of the biracial people speaking on these experiences have white moms.", "All of this and add to that how she never mentions her race, it's just assumed.\n\nIt's very subtle, but it's one of the most prevalent examples of soft white privilege.", "My parents did the same thing, I didn't know my real name until I was 16 when I teacher caught it and called it out.\n\nNow I have a hard time explaining to people: my name is spelled X, pronounced Y, but my preferred name is Z. No one wants to understand", "If her being mixed makes her black, then it makes her white as well.\n\nAlso I think she used the quotes because caracterizing a first name as belonging to a race can come off as strange.", "Well, at least it\u2019s a compromise I guess lol", "also that she even uses words like \"dumb\" and \"stupid\" in relation to things her daughter says or her preferences, speaks volumes of how little regard and respect she has for her as a person. At least in my book.", "Why do you so \"breezily dismiss\" the fact that the sperm donor is a felon?", "I am concerned about this comment: She had never cared about being \"black\" in her life.

YTA.", "She's never \"cared about being black\" because she has a racist mother who has never acknowledged that she has a black daughter. Good job trying to erase part of her history.
