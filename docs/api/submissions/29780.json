The plan was that me and another mate, along with the guy who's party it is, were bringing booze. and I thought everyone going was 18 too. Apparently not.\n\nA friend of mine who is also going told me yesterday that the guy is inviting these 2 girls, \"G\" & \"V\", to this party. G and V are both 16, which is chill, no problem, but I also don't want it on my head that I gave booze to 16 year olds if something bad were to happen due to it.\n\nSo I messaged in the group chat we have and basically said \n\n\"Ay, look, I haven't got a problem with G and V, but at the same time mate, I'm not gonna bring booze to the party if they're gonna be there. Don't get me wrong, I drank when I was 16 too, but if they get hurt due to drinking too much, and they will, they're 16, I don't want that on my head. I'll bring money in place if you want and you can do whatever with it, but it's in my best interest to not give booze to people too young to know when to stop\".\n\nAnd since then, him and half of the group chat, including G and V, have called me a killjoy and a goodie-two-shoes for not bringing booze. They haven't uninvited me but they aren't happy.\n\nI think I did the right thing, but Idk. I'm not some Goodie-Goodie, I've done my share of drinking and other substances before I was grown, and sometimes it fucked me up. And I know these girls, and they won't stop till they get sick and I don't wanna make them sick off of my booze.\n\nAm I the asshole for not bringing booze to a party?", "created_utc": 1698411064, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hmuhb/aita_for_not_bringing_booze_to_a_party/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sucks being the only level headed one in the group, you get the most shit but if anything happens it won\u2019t be your fault", "So your \"mates\" are trying to shame you into providing alcohol to children whom they know will not drink responsibly and are likely to overdo it.

I must be out of touch even at 29. NTA", "Lol not wanting to give booze to people too young to know when to stop. I know plenty of folk way older than 18 who don't know when to stop.

They want you to supply the alcohol so they can do this easier.", "NTA. You're doing the right thing and offering your friends an opportunity to step back from the alcohol imperative. You're doing what you can to protect the minors at the party, for which I applaud you. Whatever happens, your response is one of polite, adult responsibility. You're not trashing anyone; you are clear-thinking and centered. Nicely done.", "NTA. This is why byod is a thing", "are they the only 2 people under 18 that will be there?", "Nta", "NTA.  Good for you for the maturity you are showing.  And for thinking about the legal liability. And for offering a smart compromise to protect yourself.\n\nYour friends should be a bit smarter and think about your point of view, and think about protecting themselves too.", "You don't want to be charged with providing controlled substances to a minor, seems perfectly logical to me.

You did the right thing.  The world needs more people like you.", "NTA, you have the right instinct here.\n\nI do not know the laws in Australia. I do know the laws on this where I live. Here, if there are underage drinkers at a party and something happens, *every* legal adult at the party is liable. Doesn't matter if you brought the liquor or not if you are old enough to have purchased it and with underage people drinking (outside of a bar where it is the bar's problem), you are committing a crime.\n\nSo if I were you, I would verify whether or not there is any possibility of trouble for you even if you didn't provide the booze. If it is possible, then I'd skip the party.", "I don't know if you're TA but you're definitely a hypocrite. Who bought you booze when you were 16?", "I mean, if you bring money that you know they\u2019re going to used to buy alcohol which you know the girls are going to drink, and you\u2019ll be there seeing them do it, this really seems like some sort of weird exercise in virtue signaling. YTA for that.", "[deleted]", "YTA that's just slavery with extra steps. Either you condone the underage drinking or you don't. If you don't then you shouldn't be going to the party and bringing money that will be used for booze. If you do then stop trying to hide behind this bs about well I'm not the one directly buying it so my moral compass is clean.\n\n\"Yeah I'm not a pdf file but I go the strip club that has a pdf file room in the back but it's okay because I don't go to the back.\" You see how this doesn't really work out.

Sounds like you\u2019re not from the US and I don\u2019t know how similar your laws are but here if you give alcohol to a minor and anything happens to or because of them later you can get in HUGE legal trouble.

In England and Wales (which I assume this is), it is legal for anyone over the age of 5 to drink alcohol in a private home. If you are an adult hosting a party in your home, and a child attends, it is completely legal for that child to have a drink.\n\n(The child's parents might not want them to drink, but that's a question of parental discipline and not law.)\n\nSo in this case, it is legal for the 16 year olds to drink at the party.

You are still bringing booze to that party, just using a friend as proxy. Morally, there should be basically no difference imo.", "[deleted]", "Tho, one big reason for that is that alcohol is tabooised instead of talked about and taught. So the first time they go drinking, they go really overboard.\n\nYou do not have that frequent poisoning issue in Germany where kids can drink beer from 16, but also get lectures about it and first beer is typically with a dad at birthday.", "Because if I bring it, others will drink it. Party logic overrides basic decency", "Hell I suppose at the physical level it doesn't. But for my own sanity, if I don't hand them the bottle, at least I can say I didn't give them booze.

No matter what though, I'm fucked.\n\nIf I bring booze: kids get drunk, maybe hurt, and then I'm a dickhead\n\nI don't bring booze, I bring money: money likely gets spent on booze, kids get drunk, maybe hurt, and then I'm a dickhead.\n\nI don't bring anything: I'm a dickhesd for not bringing anything to a party and expecting everyone else to shill out.", "Thats what it is though. The entire thing is me not wanting to supply booze to kids.", "If you knew your money was going to crack, yea. You bought them crack.", "Does it have to be booze? Why not bring pizza? Cake? Chips? Sandwiches?", "Bringing money wont do shit to you, it's not illegal to give money to people, and if someone asks just say it was for snacks. You shouldn't be obliged to bring booze to minors", "[deleted]", "Yeah but this is the thing. I don't know that he'll buy booze with it. He hasn't explicitly said \"I'd you bring money I'm buying booze with it\".\n\nLike mate, I know full well I'm clutching at moral straws here, but no matter what I do I'm an asshole to someone here, so this is the lesser of about 4 evils", "Fair point. I was bringing snacks anyway but I could just get more. Can't ever have too many snacks", "Have I tried to stop them drinking??? Have I said \"Don't drink. You're kids.\" No. I've just said they aren't drinking my booze. It's like a parent saying their kid can smoke but they won't buy it for them. They aren't trying to stop them, but they won't assist"]}
