He sounded so distraught and sad. He was like everything is hard for him, even being around his own children, and he hates himself for it, and then he told me he wanted to do something to himself because he thought it would be the best, but then went back and said he wouldn\u2019t actually do it because his wife doesn\u2019t work and that would be selfish. When I heard that I was crying, it really hurt me to hear him struggle like this and to know he could contemplate doing that to himself, but I also couldn\u2019t help but worry because it's not like I can check up on him in person. I asked him to try therapy, a support group, or even go on Reddit for support because it sounded like he had depression. He kept saying he would be fine and said he really needed someone to talk to because he doesn\u2019t feel like there is anyone he can talk to; he feels like he's putting on the version of himself that everyone wants or needs, and he's glad that he can always talk to me.\nHe ended the phone call, and I was worried, like I genuinely thought he was going to do something to himself, so after contemplating, I decided to tell his wife about some of the things he told me and that I thought she should be worried about him. His wife told me he had been acting weird and thanked me for telling her. I only told her because he told me that he feels like he doesn\u2019t need therapy, and since he refused to seek help, I thought the only choice I had was to inform someone in his life. He called me today and told me that it's good that he knows that he can\u2019t confide in me that he didn\u2019t actually mean what he said; he was just feeling emotionally drained after putting his kids to bed. I tried to explain to him, but he cut me off, and it seems like he blocked my number. His wife also told me that he didn\u2019t mean what he said, that he was just feeling overwhelmed, and that he is overall fine. (I think it's untrue because one doesn't call their sister out of nowhere and tell them something like that and not mean it.)\n\n\nMy brother was really upset. I have never heard him sound so upset in my life. Was I wrong to have told his wife what he told me? Did I handle the situation wrong because I was genuinely worried for him, but it seems like he and his wife think he is okay? I just need to know wether I was wrong\u2026..", "created_utc": 1690716524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15djbjl/aita_for_telling_something_my_brother_told_me_to/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's a really serious line to cross, and he clearly needs help. \n\nHis safety is more important than keeping trust. I just hope he gets the help that he needs.\n\nNTA.", "Ok, so your brother made a phone call that to you, (and probably anybody that was paying attention, if they could have heard it), damn near a suicide hotline call to you, at 2 in the morning\u2026 and you told on him. Because what he said was alarming and you thought his wife should know. Well, duh.\n\nAnd now, from what you can tell, your brother and his wife are rug sweeping. You tried. NTA", "NAH. You were honestly worried about your brother and thought you were helping. You were operating on the earnest assumption that he was in danger. If he *had* done something to himself you would have been the AH for staying silent. \n\nBut your brother isn't the AH for being angry with you, regardless of whether or not he was actually a danger to himself. He thought he was talking in confidence, and there's clearly a reason he hasn't spoken to his wife about this. He's now had a grenade go off in his life and he didn't know he'd pulled the pin. He's allowed to feel hurt by the betrayal of trust.\n\nI have to assume that his wife isn't the AH because, presumably, she acted based off his actual, in person behaviour as well as what you told her and that she reacted and responded in an appropriate way.\n\nThis whole thing sucks. Especially because if there *is* something more going on with your brother he may keep it inside. But that is not your fault, you acted on good faith and it's a blessing that he *didn't* hurt himself the way you thought he would.", "NTA. It\u2019s warning flags like that you are supposed to look for with suicide.", "NAH \n\nBut this is the wrong sub. \n\nI hope he gets help.", "NTA\n\nYour brother may trust you again, but not for a long time. He may also see where you were right to tell his wife. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s taking this track, but you did the right thing.", "NTA. You were concerned for his well-being and safety, and you wanted to make sure he had someone to support him and help him. He told you some very alarming things, such as wanting to do something to himself, not feeling anything for his children, and being miserable.\n\n* He sounded like he was depressed and suicidal, and he needed professional help.\n* You did not betray his trust or break his confidence, you acted out of love and care.\n\n He and his wife are in denial and they are trying to minimize his problems. They are the assholes for blaming you and blocking you, instead of thanking you and getting him the help he needs. Y", "NTA. \n\nYou weren't wrong. Your intentions were good. You believe(d) he was/is sick and possibly a danger to himself. Situations like this, the other person is not likely to show any gratitude for your intervention. Don't take it personally. He will likely come around eventually. At least now, you know you did everything you could for him :)", "Yta, Instead of going straight to his wife you could have just been there for him so he has someone to talk to, you've just shown him that you can't be trusted because the one time he comes to you for support you go and spill everything his told you to his wife, you could have made an effort to call him over the next few weeks and see how he was before you even went to his wife, you've probably made him more closed off.\n\nI've felt like your brother has sometimes, I also confided in one of my siblings about my feelings when I was having a down day and she did the exact same thing you did and went and told someone else, our relationship wasn't the same after that, I don't talk to anyone about how I'm feeling anymore because I don't trust that their not going to go and tell other people so I keep everything to myself.\n\nPeople can down vote me as much as they want, but not everyone finds it easy to speak about their feelings, op was probably the one person he felt he could talk to, he finally opens up to someone about how his been feeling and what his going through and instead of being there for him and showing him he could trust her she decides to go and tell his wife everything he told her.", "Yes, you were wrong. Your brother now cannot trust you, so won't resume your relationship. Whatever support you could have given him is now gone, and his life is more bleak because of it. It may have felt important because you were worried he might take his own life or self harm, but the end result is everyone loses here.\n\nSorry to tell you that. You seem like a nice person who was trying their best for the brother they love, but you messed this one up. YTA.", "NTA and honestly the no asshole comments are too kind to your brother. He's a grown ass man. He said things that would make any reasonable relative worried and instead of opening up to his wife he's bottling everything up inside and cutting off what might be his only support system.\n\nIt's possible you could have handled this better, don't get me wrong. But you don't need to handle things perfectly to avoid being an asshole.  \n\n\nI would find a way to let him know that you're always there if he needs you", "Absolutely YTA\n\nYou betrayed his trust and tattled to his wife when he was vulnerable and trusted you.\n\nAnd people wonder why men are emotionally closed off. It's exactly shit like thus.\n\nEdit: If you were concerned he would harm himself, you could reach out for THAT. Not data dump everything", "NTA. The phone call was a cry for help. He may feel betrayed, but informing someone physically closer to him was the best thing to do. It\u2019s a little late for this situation, but the best advice I can give as a mandatory reporter is always be upfront with the person sharing if you think you need to inform someone else. In this case , the best thing to do would be thank him for opening up to you, express how concerned you are and that you want to know he\u2019s receiving help, and that you can\u2019t promise you won\u2019t share this information to make sure he\u2019s safe. \n\nGive him and his wife time. While he\u2019s still in the grip of depression he may have lingering anger, but this may subside once he\u2019s in a better place.", "YTA\n\nWhen your friend says concerning thoughts, you should directly confront them about it *first*.  You could have expressed concern, and possible help, and see how they take it.  If you do not feel at ease by the end of the conversation, you should tell them of your intentions before you speak to their partner.  You can explain that it violates your regular belief of privacy but their safety is the most important.  Be up front.  No one appreciates being blind sided by their partner paired with being betrayed by their sister.  If you are direct, it shows respect and builds the relationship through hardships.", "YTA All you had to do was listen to support your brother. He did not ask for answers nor assistance and he certainly did not ask you to tell other people his vulnerable feelings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He wasn't talking to people in his life before you and you were trying to keep your brother alive.", "No.  You did the right thing telling his wife.\n\nNTA", "You seem to think that the wife would be able to prevent a suicide attempt. I expect the wife is barely any better than he is, if not worse. First, talking about self harm is a first step, it is serious, but does not necessarily lead on to action. The brother specifically said he would not do it. It would be hard to get psychiatric intervention based upon this call.\n\nThe wife maybe can help, but it really is not a good idea to repeat stuff said in confidence and desperation. Persuade the brother to talk to his wife himself. Do not take that control away from him. Next time the brother may call samaritans instead, who for reasons related have a strict no interference policy.\n\nI know you want there to be a solution where the brother is helped, loving family are there for him and everybody gets to live happily ever after. Unfortunately overwhelm is not like that. Twins are unbelievably stressful. Brother wanted to vent, explain what his level of sleep deprivation, exhaustion and care fatigue felt like. Now he has to deal with this, the impact of hearing this on his wife, as an additional stress.\n\nI see I'm down voted for my opinion, and I can't say I am surprised. But I thoroughly recommend not breaching confidence unless there is an immediate risk of harm - if the brother says he has taken pills, or is tying the rope, get the wife involved, call an ambulance.

You had no way to know if he really would do something.\n\nHowever, your brother voiced his thoughts and frightened you to the point where you wanted someone to help him. You are NTA for that at all, and once he starts back on the road to recovery, hopefully he will see that.\n\nI'm sorry you are caught in the crossfire here.

You absolutely did the right thing; someone nearby needs to know: his wife, a best friend, a parent... anyone.
