That's when he started calling us teletubbies\" so you guys come out with the sun rise and go to bed with the sunset\", I showed them a picture I took of the sunset and De was amazed but he continued \"joking\" , he repeated the teletubbies thing three more times and everytime I divert the conversation he gets back to it\n\n, so I looked at him and :\nMe: tone it down already that's enough.\nDe: what's wrong, he is just mocking you (she said that yes)\nMe: exactly?!\nDe: you just don't know him yet , that's how he jokes.\nMe: I don't know him and he doesn't know me so he shouldn't be making fun of us.\n\nA little after she sent me a message berating me for not telling her I'm annoyed instead of embarrassing her husband like that.

You lost a friend because she married an asshole, not because of anything you did. You were conversing normally until Mo started mocking you.
