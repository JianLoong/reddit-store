If you set the expectation that you wait until their sister is home to open presents, that will be their expectation. It requires you to spend effort and time to address the three year old's impatience but that's part of dealing with a three year old, right? If this were his birthday and he could see the cake on the counter, would you let him have it for breakfast or wait until the party in the afternoon?
