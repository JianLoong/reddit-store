If you set the expectation that you wait until their sister is home to open presents, that will be their expectation. It requires you to spend effort and time to address the three year old's impatience but that's part of dealing with a three year old, right? If this were his birthday and he could see the cake on the counter, would you let him have it for breakfast or wait until the party in the afternoon?

OP is blaming the daughter for OPs other children having to wait, when it\u2019s obviously not the 7yo\u2019s fault", "No because she's opening her own gifts.", "Yes it is for a 3 year old.", "Yes- every Christmas our kids have to wait for dad to get home from work to open Santa gifts. It\u2019s a non issue", "I guarantee you, most 3 year olds are told to wait pretty often", "I still can\u2019t get around the fact that people in the US get dozens of Christmas gifts. \n\nMy kids get only one gift (plus stockings), and they don\u2019t complain.", "It\u2019s a tricky situation for blended families. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong and your husband is running on divorced parent guilt and not thinking of the kids who are in his home. It is not okay to make the kids who live with both parents under one roof make up for his guilt. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to not have an equal number of gifts in this situation, so that your littles have something to open before sister arrives on these alternating years. Keep in mind, sister is opening presents at her mom\u2019s house, so that wouldn\u2019t make an imbalance to give your littles a couple of extra small things. Those small things could be activity oriented to keep busy until 1. Like playdoh, a really cool coloring set, a game. Make a new tradition for these \u201ceven\u201d years. \n\nIf I\u2019m correct, the next time this will happen will be 3, 5, and 9. The littles will be old enough to know, and punishing them for their sister not being there will cause issues. I say this as I\u2019m assuming that next year, she\u2019ll wake up in your home, and Christmas morning will commence with presents right away in the morning.", "If it\u2019s supposed to be a family fun experiences, is your family complete with out her? If it is, then go ahead and open them. \n\nAlso, she would have EVEN more presents for him to watch her open later if he opens all his now.", "Don't your kids get presents from your side of the family? Can't they open them in the morning? In a couple of years your kids are going to hear about all the extra presents she got to open in the morning while they had to wait.", "My Husband and I don't get gifts for one another, just the kids \ud83d\ude42", "It's ok to teach patience and yes I had kids and remember how hard that is.  It's not ruined", "Absolutely they're told to wait. It's the listening part that's a problem! \nWe're going to hide the majority of the gifts for the future years to come and only put one or two for the younger kids to open on the years that their big sis is at her bio moms house. That way they still get a Christmas morning and everyone is included when big sis comes home", "Not everyone gets dozens of gifts, it's just that kids are easy to get dozens of gifts for. For Christmas this year I got socks and some books plus a stocking full of my fav candies. I'm 17 and don't need toys anymore. I have nieces and nephews who are getting dozens upon dozens of gifts as they have 3 Christmases. One with bio grandpa and step grandma, one with bio Grandma and step grandpa and one with there parents not to mention any gifts from aunts and uncles and older cousins and great/great great grandparents. Split family's make it were presents fall in the few dozen range and that's just how that is.", "it\u2019s not just US i\u2019m australian and i get multiple gifts from my parents, one or two from my sister. one from my dads side of the family (because there is 18 of them) and then a gift from each set of grandparents and another gift from the 2 families on my mums side. we didn\u2019t do stocking we did massive ass sacks until we reached high school then we were cut off from sacks", "Yes, you are correct", "It definitely isn't complete without her. I think from now on, we will only put 1 or 2 gifts under the tree for the littles on the years that 7 is at her bio moms house. That way we can all open together and there's no tantrums from anyone", "We go to my mom's when we have all of the kids. Some years we go to my moms on Christmas eve so that all 3 kids are there for the gifts, other years (like this one) we will go over for Christmas dinner. Our years alternate with 7 on who have her Christmas morning and who have her Christmas evening", "I have seen tik tok where the gifts make out half the living room. It looks like Dudley Dursley. WTF? \n\nMy eldest\u2019s gift is that we are paying half of his driving lessons. My middle one got Doc Marteen that she had been wanting all year and my youngest asked for a cosplay costume. They got candies and gizmos in their stocking. \n\nThey will likely get a small gift from\nGrandma. Maybe something from their uncles. But that\u2019s pretty much all. They are grateful for what they got and are not missing.", "This sounds great. Your boys have Santa presents to open in the morning and if one of them is something to assemble then the time will fly until big sis comes. But definitely hide those presents until Christmas day or they'll be into them!", "Like I said blended family's have it different"]}
