We have been together for 5 years and now have a 3 year old and a 1 year old. This year is the 7 year old's mother's turn to have her for Christmas morning, and we will get her at 1 pm on Christmas day. Our son can visibly see the presents under the tree and keeps trying to get to them. My husband is insisting that we wait for our daughter to come home from her mother's house for all of the kids to open their gifts together. I feel that this is unfair because our son is 3. He knows what presents are and is excited to open his gifts. Why should he have to wait when the 7 year old doesn't? She gets to open gifts at her mother's house as soon as she wakes up and then comes home to open her gifts at our house as soon as she gets here. Our 1 year old doesn't know the difference, but our 3 year old is getting impatient and curious about what's under the tree.

If you set the expectation that you wait until their sister is home to open presents, that will be their expectation. It requires you to spend effort and time to address the three year old's impatience but that's part of dealing with a three year old, right? If this were his birthday and he could see the cake on the counter, would you let him have it for breakfast or wait until the party in the afternoon?

This is my kids\u2019 experience every year since they could talk. \n\n\nIn my opinion it is cruel and unnecessary to not let a young kid open his presents on Christmas morning. 3 is totally old enough to know it\u2019s Christmas and to have been counting down. That\u2019s what advent calendars are for! Plus it\u2019s a very big ask for a child that age to wait longer than necessary for a special treat they\u2019ve been waiting on! My kids can\u2019t wait to get downstairs and open their presents- OP\u2019s eldest will be the same! \n\n\nNow we try to hold off a little by opening our stockings upstairs, but they are desperate to get downstairs and see if Santa brought them what they asked for, especially if they r been trying to be good, etc!

There are so many alternatives and options other than the kids getting nothing at all till she comes in. \n\n\nWhy not let the 3 yo open everything from everyone on the mother\u2019s side of the family, which is what stepchild is doing at their mum\u2019s house. When she comes back, all their children can open all their presents from the dad and mum/stepmum together. They should consider stockings for next year too, as that really takes the edge off the rush to open presents! This is going to be an issue every second year, so they need a plan and to build their own traditions to suit their family set up. \n\n\nWhen mines were that young they couldn\u2019t handle opening ALL their presents in the one go, as they wanted to play with things. It might work well for this family to open in sections too, giving the kids time to play with their new toys before opening more. But you just can\u2019t have little kids gazing longingly at the piles of presents under the tree for the whole morning and onto the afternoon. Most of their day will be over before they get their presents! It\u2019s not fair on the littles, dad needs to remember what littles are like and be realistic. There are compromises to be worked out - going off in a big strop and refusing to cook the Christmas dinner as previously agreed is NOT ok, nor reasonable. \n\n\nIs dad having issues with being separated from his oldest kid? Kinda tough luck, as that\u2019s the consequences of his relationship collapsing - his job as parent is to support his children, as none of them chose this - he had a kid and split with their mum so shared custody is consequence. Splitting her day between both parents is a custody arrangement they have agreed to in advance, it\u2019s not like it was a big surprise. Dad chose to have more kids with someone else who he lives with, also not those kids\u2019 choice, and none of the kids should have to be disadvantaged by the decisions their dad has made in the past. I know every couple is different: there are good reasons to split up/ yadda yadda. Not disputing that. Fact remains that the KIDS involved had no choice in the matter - it\u2019s all the parents doing so the parents need to manage it all fairly for each child. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask of parents to think of all their kids and work out solutions that work for all. in two years time the stepchild will be at their mum\u2019s again on Christmas morning- hopefully they\u2019ll have worked out a plan by then based on how today went. \n\n\nNTA OP - your husband needs to get a grip of whatever\u2019s going on with him. Christmas is for the kids, it\u2019s a magical day FOR THEM. Don\u2019t let him spoil your kids\u2019 day with unfair expectations on very young children, or throw hissy fits and back out of important stuff. Saying he\u2019s done with Christmas \ud83d\ude44 was that in earshot of your 3 yo? Remember they are more aware of what\u2019s going on around them than we realise, and they are little sponges.

Last year it wasn\u2019t an issue because they had the then 6 year old but the year before they had the 3 year old who was one so they knew this was coming.", "Yeah I could *sorta* see not figuring it out until *this* year because they switch off Christmas so this year is the maybe the first year with separate Christmases that one of the younger kids is enough of a person to care about waiting.\n\nBut also 3 year-old did not magically transform into an impatient toddler overnight.", "Yeah. I picked up the vibe that I don't think she likes her stepdaughter very much. Poor kid.", "What are their beliefs about Santa?  Like are all gifts from Santa, or only some?\n\nIn our family, Santa only brings one small gift per person, and the rest of the gifts the kids know are from parents and other family.   We don't want our kids to think there is some sort of moral reason they get more or less toys on Christmas than other kids, so we're very clear about which gifts are from who (and what is from Santa).\n\nWe often travel for Christmas, so the gifts from me and my husband are often opened earlier in the week (I'm so glad they had new toys to entertain them during the recent snowstorm!!), and then there is only one small gift to actually open on Christmas (and maybe more at grandparents house in the afternoon).\n\nSo for us, it wouldn't be an issue waiting to open the Santa gift because the main gifts were opened a few days earlier.  This might not be a potential solution you're looking for, but maybe celebrating the gift part of Christmas on a day when you have all the kids all day might make things a little easier for everyone.", "That was my first thought!
