Recently (in the last 2 weeks), my 2 suite-mates from college moved in with me until they can get on their feet.\n\nWe all have pretty packed schedules as a result of our jobs and two of us being in grad school.\n\nDue to this, they created schedules for when each person will do certain things. For example, \u201cCassidy\u201d will do her laundry on Monday mornings, while \u201cMarie\u201d will do hers on Tuesday mornings. My day to day agendas are less open than theirs, so they don\u2019t include me in these schedules but I\u2019ve learned when they do what.\n\nWe\u2019ve found that keeping things on a steady rotation makes it easy for everyone to have access to appliances and whatever else when needed, so we kind of assigned ourselves times at which we shower (there\u2019s one bathroom and one half bath)\n\nI always shower in the mornings, \u201cCassidy\u201d midday, and \u201cMarie\u201d in the evenings. This is because these are the times that our schedules open up. It sounds silly but it\u2019s really worked for us and reduced arguments so I\u2019m fine with anything.\n\nHere\u2019s where the issue comes in:\n\nLast night, \u201cCassidy\u201d and \u201cMarie\u201d attended a university banquet while I was in my evening classes. In my lab, we ended up doing dissections and I felt pretty gross afterwards so I planned to shower as soon as I got home. \n\nI was aware that \u201cMarie\u201d usually showers in the evenings, but they had both said they wouldn\u2019t be home until well after midnight. I got home at 8 and immediately took a shower (15 minutes max).\n\nWhen I got out, both of my roommates were sitting on the couch glaring at me demanding to know why I showered outside of schedule. I apologized several times and told them I wouldn\u2019t have showered if I knew they\u2019d be home at that time.\n\n\u201cCassidy\u201d let up and said she doesn\u2019t care and knew I wasn\u2019t trying to be rude, but \u201cMarie\u201d has been making side comments.\n\nAITA?\n\n*they don\u2019t pay rent and only have one bill each\n\nETA: I texted our group chat when I arrived at home, so they were aware of my plans to shower and neither objected.\n\nTiny UPDATE: After spending the majority of my night last night reading through everyone\u2019s comments, I\u2019ve decided to do 2 things.\n\n1. I\u2019m going to draft a rent plan charging each of them $700 a month, which would mean that they\u2019re each pulling 1/3 of the weight when it comes to bills and utilities. This draft will also include specific statements about what I am free to do in my own home and how schedule conflicts will be resolved (a simple text should suffice, in my opinion. But I leave it open for discussion.)\n\n2. If they refuse to agree to my terms, I have spoken to attorney (as a friend! I\u2019m not taking legal action yet) and she recommended 30 days for them to find other living arrangements. Therefore, if they refuse to pay rent, they\u2019ll be out within the next month. \n\nThank you everyone for the advice! Working on my rent agreement now :)\n\n\n\nUPDATE NUMBER TWO: \n\nSo, I had the rent discussion with both Cassidy and Marie. \n\nCassidy immediately agreed, and asked if we could have it written just so that we both stick to it. \n\nMarie, however, blew up saying she was not paying to live in my house and it was ridiculous for me to ask that now. Cassidy and I both tried mediating the situation but she want on a rampage yelling at us and saying she\u2019d just move out if this is how it was going to be. \n\nShe asked Cassidy to move into an apartment with her and help pay bills but Cassidy said no and that she\u2019d rather stay with me and just pay rent. Marie left immediately after that and hasn\u2019t texted us since. It\u2019s been a couple of hours. Unsure of what her next plans are, but I plan to kick her out if she doesn\u2019t pay her dues.", "created_utc": 1676437214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112pyqj/aita_for_showering_when_my_roommate_was_going_to/", "score": 1065, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They shouldn't have been petty about it since it is a shared space and having such a frigid schedule for when you can use the shower is a bit much. It may be convenient during most days for the group but it should be accepted to break away from the schedule when needed. It's personal hygiene and 15 minutes is not a very long time to wait to go next. Especially if they arrived at there while you were in the shower. It was most likely less than 15 minutes.", "NTA. You had a valid reason to need a shower and they weren't supposed to be home. Slide comments are completely inappropriate. \n\nI'd be tempted to reply, \"Why are you making snide comments as though you own the place when you don't even pay rent?\" Or threaten to kick them out next time they give you grief about what you do in your own home when they've said they won't even be home.  But that's me.", "NTA.", "NTA,  but did Marie actually go shower after complaining?  Or was she just being super petty?", "kick them out. they will never leave and things are only going to get worse.", "OP, you are NTA because: \n\n\u2022 You had good reason to expect them not to come home until much later (they told you so), and therefore determined that this wouldn\u2019t affect them according to the information you were given\n\n\u2022 You further went out of your way to let them know you planned to shower when you got home and again, were given no indication that this would negatively impact either one (no response to the text)\n\n\u2022 Your shower was only 15 minutes, and this was an \u201ceverybody getting home and wanting to go to bed\u201d situation where at worst someone would have to hang out on the couch a few more minutes and get to bed an absolute max of 15 minutes later because of your shower. It was not even a situation where it could possibly make someone late for work, class, etc.\n\n\u2022 (It sounds like) You were never part of a conversation where you agreed to only showering at a specific time in the first place. They might have had that conversation between the two of them, but you weren\u2019t part of it and thus never actually agreed to only ever shower in the morning (and even so, an exception like this should be fine for all the other reasons). You can\u2019t be held responsible for disappointing expectations that you never knew about **and** agreed to meet. \n\n\u2022 You apologized anyway, even though you really aren\u2019t in the wrong. Nice of you to apologize for possibly causing an inconvenience in case there was a misunderstanding though. (I do not mean that to sound sarcastic at all!)\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s your house and they aren\u2019t paying rent, only one bill each which I assume is no where near what you pay each month. That means you get to run your house how you want to. This is not an equal partnership, because their contributions are not equitable. They can find somewhere else to live if they don\u2019t like it.  \n\n\nHaving said all of that, OP, it\u2019s time to sit down and have an actual conversation about expectations. I promise, as much as you don\u2019t want to have it now, it will only get harder if you don\u2019t do it right now before things get worse. Everyone should agree on what the expectations are for how you live together, and then in the future you can discuss when those expectations aren\u2019t met. Make it clear. And OP, while they should get some say in things since they are contributing some, ultimately it\u2019s your house, your rules, and they can choose to stop paying their one bill and leave if they don\u2019t like that. You don\u2019t necessarily need to say it quite so bluntly like that to their faces, but let that reality back you up and give you some confidence when you approach this issue. Basically, know that you can pull the \u201cit\u2019s my house, you can leave if you don\u2019t want to do it my way\u201d card if you need to (but hopefully you won\u2019t need to).", "NTA.
