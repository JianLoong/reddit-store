Knowledge is power and if that child is autistic, early intervention is probably the best thing. I am quick to say NTA, by the way,  because in your post, you say dad became offended and you immediately dropped it.", "NTA.  He's in denial.  2 kids with 2 different women and both kids may have autism means he's the common denominator.", "NTA. The earlier the diagnosis, the faster and better things can be done to accommodate and help the child. That said, it's indeed not your business, so mention it once yeah, after that it's up to them.", "NTA. You recognized some signs, made a suggestion, but left it at that. If he chooses not to pursue it, that's on him and his new wife.\n\nI personally hope they pursue it in the end, though. I have ADHD and was left undiagnosed until I was well into my 20s. The negative impact that going through my entire school career without that diagnosis was immense.", "NTA\n\nI think he\u2019s in denial. Hopefully he\u2019ll get over it but overall no you are not an AH.", "NTA\n\nYou were just making a suggestion and well, she does seem to have a few traits from what you said.\nI'm autistic myself, I was only diagnosed two years ago (I'm 18) though since normally it's \"more difficult\" to find in girls. (Since all the stuff is based off of young boys)", "NTA. He\u2019s in denial.", "NTA, you've been trying to be helpful and offered perspective. This might change half-sisters life in a very positive way. You did the right thing.", "NTA - He sucks.", "NTA- waiting list for diagnosis's of autism in my area can take up to 2 years.  \n\nDecent therapy waitlists can be about the same.  (If you don't care where you take your kid, maybe 6 months.)\n\nThere is no harm putting your child on a waitlist for an evaluation.\n\nBecause of that age kiddos can change or show you or work it through and you can always just cancel the appointment.  That's the beauty of it.  And some other parent will be happy they moved up a slot.", "NTA. Your ex knows that girl has the 'tism but he's in denial and angry about it.", "NTA \n\nYou just unintentionally suggested that your ex could have the tism trait in him. He did not like that very much. Also, he already knows his daughter could be on the spectrum. He\u2019s not taking it well.", "NTA\n\nEarly detection is seriously helpful.\n\nThe other being, if you've noticed, that means he's noticed and since he's no longer with you, that means it's not your side of the family i.e. *he* may need to get tested and doesn't want to acknowledge that.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a v sensitive topic. I remember when a friend's son (he's 11,now) was born. A mutual friend who was v open about her autistic son noticed some things and tried to tell her but mum was offended. It soon wore off though as she got him tested before he turned 2 and he is autistic. All of her kids actually are.\n\nI say that to say itsba sensitive topic and not everyone is ready or wants to hear that. You did all you can do which was mention it. Its in their court. Leave it to them to process and get testing. If you feel up to it and the relationship reflects in, youbcan offer support (but only when they reach out). This must be handled delicately.\n\nWell done you though for reaching out and wanting the best for your ex's family.", "NAH. You're not wrong for suggesting it but you're not the girl's mom. I don't know the relationship between you and the dad but depending on how that is, bringing up neuro divergence in his kids could be a violation of his boundaries", "NAH, borderline N T A though. I think you were well-intentioned, but I also can see how it would be jarring and make your ex defensive. He probably already sees it too and isn\u2019t ready to face it. He definitely overreacted, but it probably touched a nerve.", "[deleted]", "ESH. But hear me out. My young son has complex medical needs. Neurological stuff in a nutshell. My best friend has a son who\u2019s one year younger. He too has his problems and we are both on this hectic journey of early intervention getting assessed before they start school etc. We are stupid close, best friends since highschool, we tell eachother everything. Hollywood movie fucking best friend dream team. We\u2019ve recommended Ocupational therapists, speech therapists, pediatricians to one another. We talk about how our therapies are going, milestones blah blah blah. But unsolicited advice especially on how our sons are developing and what could seem a bit off is a no go. I know you were only trying to help but it\u2019s not your place to say anything.", "YTA - I know you meant well, but his kids are not your kids. He was on the same journey as you in finding out your shared son was autistic. He has the same information you do about the signs, what the could mean, and how to handle it. And he has much more information when it comes to his daughter. \n\nMaybe they are having her tested. Maybe he wants to but his wife is against it. Maybe they have had their daughter tested and they don't want to share that information with you for whatever reason. You, your ex, and his wife co-parent your son. You don't co-parent their children. I know that can be hard, but you need to respect their boundaries. \n\nUnless you think their daughter is being neglected in some way or you think the way they parent their kids is impacting your child, you need to stay out of how they parent their kid.", "NAH - You expressed concern and he set a boundary. No harm done.", "YTA, it's not your business. Off course your ex is going to resent you for sticking your nose in things that dont concern you. Are you this clueless?", "I go against the majority here and say YTA, not a huge one, but still.\n\nThese kids are like some random strangers kids to you, you are not involved in parenting them. Don't walk around and suggest other ppl to test their kids for xy if you are not a medical professional (and medical professionals wouldn't do that anyway). \n\nIt doesn't sound like you guys are close friends and he didn't asked you for your advise. And if he was around your son regulary, i'm pretty sure he already noticed. \n\nHe was right to shut you down immidiately. Otherwise your next move would have been to give him a list with unasked advise what they should do if the diagnosis was positiv for autism - bc thats just the kind of stuff you expect from ppl that \"only want to help\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is the three year old working with a Speech Language Pathologist and early childhood teachers? \n\n\nI taught at an elementary school for 15 years. I spoke with parents/guardians about concerns throughout that time. I tried to approach each conversation with respect and empathy. Kids sometimes need additional layers of support, and that's okay. The earlier the intervention, the more effective it is. \n\n\nSome parents weren't ready to hear what I had to say. I've had parents become very upset and direct their anger towards me.

I asked to be anonymous and just told the teacher the child reminded me of my boys at that age and how I\u2019d wished someone had mentioned it back then even if I\u2019d initially been dismissive as at least it would have been on my radar.  I don\u2019t know the parent/family well and I\u2019m not a health care professional so could be seeing things that aren\u2019t there as I\u2019ve only observed them at a few school functions but I didn\u2019t want to say nothing and hear about them hitting secondary school and falling apart like my two did.  Their small private prep school has enough one to one attention and extra curriculars that would keep adhd from impacting their schooling like with my boys but if the yea her is looking out for them now and agrees with me they can raise it with the family and get them help early.\n\nI\u2019d leave it now and not bring it up again and yes it was probably a case of shoot the messenger as he probably secretly was \u201cblaming\u201d you for autism in the family but now realised it\u2019s more likely his side that has it and it still has so much stigma attached - hopefully for her sake he will put aside his ego and look at her with fresh eyes now and get her checked in case you are correct.", "NTA wonder if your ex feels that he has defective genes or something like that?
