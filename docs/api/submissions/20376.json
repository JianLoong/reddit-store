Yes, but at 12 months wasn't talking at all, delayed walking and crawling, and several other things, I was getting frustrated. My Mom went with me to an appointment and I ended up pulling him and bringing him to another pedi.

Sometimes I hate small towns and small mentalities. \n\nSo, when I saw some of the same signs in my niece and nephew I talked to my Mom and we said something to my brother.

My brother does too. My brother makes sure HE has meds (my brother has no job and no insurance, so I have NO clue where he is getting his ADHD meds from, probably the VA??), but get his son dx?

Never mind my disastrous marriage and ongoing challenges in my career. I've managed to be professionally \"successful\" or at least to look like I've got my shit together at work, but it takes a LOT of exhausting workarounds to keep this whole enterprise afloat.

I am an elder GenXer gratefully learning so much about this stuff from younger people. I am devouring all the new knowledge.

And some things I would never have considered.  Who associates being bad with social skills with being ticklish without understanding they are both symptoms of autism?  So far from being upset, I found it a huge relief.

My niece and nephew are autistic, as are every single one of their cousins on their father's side. On closer inspection, it's obvious that bil, his 2 brothers and his mum and dad are all autistic. Despite this - and the absence of autistic cousins on our side of the family, bil has convinced himself that it's come from our side of the family. Even when my nephew has told him flatly that he's autistic just like him, it's a catastrophe for the night (he has a full on melt down) and then forgets the conversation ever occurred by the following morning. OP would be better to approach the new wife as she's more likely to be open to the possibility than the dad.", "I got diagnosed at about 21 yo, and I was of two minds - one being I'm glad I finally got answers to some questions, can work through things, and put certain things in place; other being wishing I got the diagnosis earlier in that I didn't have to go through school feeling like the odd one out or feeling like a bit of a social outcast and not knowing why or how to fix it", "I have a friend who is a teacher with a learning disability.

Play it cool, don\u2019t start self diagnosing, let them ask the questions and you just have your answers ready.\n\nI tried going to a GP and it was nooooooo help. I went to my therapist and she agreed with me, but again couldn\u2019t do much. So I went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed and began treatment.
