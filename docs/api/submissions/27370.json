It\u2019s one thing to have friends and hang out with them but a completely different thing to constantly ditch your partner for your friend. If the friend needs emergency attention then fine but cancelling plans with your fianc\u00e9 just because she is coming over for a hang out? Naur. You can always hang out with the friend afterwards.

You shouldn't have called the families and yelled about him - you should have just ended the engagement without the drama. But it is definitely not great that you are purposely excluded.

Part of being the friend of the opposite sex is also respecting the boundaries of who they choose to be with. Although I never heard any complaints from the women, I would not put my best friend in a situation to fight with his woman over me. It's called respect. \n\nI now have friendships with these ladies.

I get wanting to help a friend when they need it, but this friend should have more than one person they can go to and needs to form other healthy relationships outside of just your partner.\n\nFinal verdict, NTA. Almost made it to AH territory for controlling rhetoric, but the situation's specifics really show other issues outside of your control, and it's normal to want a partner to pay attention to you.", "YTA.

Then, you really don't have to give in to those demands.\n\nOf course that might mean that the relationship ends, but if a partner has really unreasonable demands, that might be for the best.
