I knew rabies was bad, but never was really scared of it. Read a few articles and was never really scared or concerned for it. Saw a video of an animal with rabies and it was the scariest shit I've ever seen. I can only imagine how much worse it would be for a human with full blown rabies acting like that, it's literally out of a horror movie, but I don't want to see actual humans acting like that, since just the thought and the video is enough for me to take it seriously.

You did the right thing.", "NTA imagine what could have happened if he did catch rabies.

How dumb can people be. They are beyond bad parents for not having him vaccinated already.", "NTA. They weren't listening, so you had to resort to extreme measures. No one forced them to watch the videos. You did a good thing.", "If there's rabies in your area then it's a requirement to get vaccinated if you've been bitten by an animal- rabies is extremely fatal and from what I understand, the vaccine is the only way to prevent death if given in a timely manner. You did what was necessary- and if the hospital immediately started him on the vaccine course, then they clearly thought it was necessary too! NTA", "NTA. \n\nwhile you are right about not interfering with parenting, being bitten by a stray dog can be dangerous. getting the vaccination is a precaution. prevention is always better than cure. there was a case recently near where i live, where the kid didnt wanna get the dog into trouble so be just cleaned the wound. but unfortunately, the kid did get rabies and passed away. it was not wrong to push your brother and sil to get their son vaccinated. \n\nIn the case of disturbing videos, giving them a reality check was necessary in this case. but try not to appear to be overbearing. that can back fire as well.", "NTA.  \"That's an odd way to say thank you.

You are welcome anyway, I am glad he has adults who care enough about his well being in his life.\"\n\nOf course, I am the type of person who sends whooping cough baby videos to people who don't vaccinate and I've played them as background ambiance for arguments people had with me.
