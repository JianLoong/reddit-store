It is a backup, only.* It has now been 19 years since Jeanna Giese pulled through & she is the mother of twins. I was living in Wisconsin at the time and remembered because there was a *lot* of news coverage.\n\nRECOVERY AFTER RABIES An experimental protocol called the Milwaukee protocol has been used to save three patients with documented rabies. The first person to survive, Jeanna Giese, developed rabies after bitten by a rabid bat. She did not receive post exposure prophylaxis. When she reached the hospital she couldn\u2019t talk, stand or sit and had fluctuating consiousness. She was ventilated and started on a ketamine-midazolam induced coma, amantidine and ribavarin. Her medical coma was withdrawn after a week and she was supplemented with tertrahydrobiopterin for 6 months. She then received intensive rehabilitation for a year. Now 4 years later, she has a driving license, is studying biology in Marian University and is normal except for a slight limp and slow speech. The second patient was 8 year old Nelsy Gomez, in Colombia who developed rabies after the bite of a rabid cat. She recovered quickly on the Milwaukee protocol but died a month later of pneumonia. Rabies is usually lethal within a week hence much credit is being given to the protocol. The third success for the protocol is from Brazil. Fifteen year old Menezes, developed rabies after a bite from a rabid bat though he did receive 4 doses of antirabies vaccine. He received the medically induced coma for 2 weeks and is now slowly being weaned off the ventilator. Willoughby, the father of the Milwaukee protocol, who is an infectious disease specialist, has studied pterins and monoamine neurotransmitter metabolites in the CSF of rabies patients. He found they had low tetrahydrobiopterin, and pathological deficiency of dopamine and serotonin transmission which may explain some of the neurological manifestations. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase is also tetrahydrobiopterin dependant and may cause cerebrovascular insufficiency. If more detailed study of the role of tertrahydrobiopterin proves its role, we will have a metabolically specific, readily available, enteral therapy for rabies.
