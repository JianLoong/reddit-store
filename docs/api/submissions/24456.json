Yesterday, my daughter F10 and me M36 attended our close family friends daughters birthday party. My daughter Korean is not very fluent so she was talking with her friend (the birthday girl) in english as the other family also immigrated to america but is staying in korea. The other children at the party were all Korean kids who were former classmates of the birthday girl. After a bit the parents of the birthday girl made my daughter go upstairs away from and essentially kicking her out of the party because she was apparently distracting the birthday girl from the other children by speaking in english. They said that she was making the other children feel  left out and that the birthday girl was only talking to my daughter in english and sent her upstairs while the other children had fun without her. My daughter was very upset, uncomfortable, and wanted to leave so i drove her home. Now the family is not talking to me. what angers me is that the parents could have simply asked the my daughter to stop speaking in english (which I would have understood) but instead choose to isolate my daughter. Now the family is saying that i ruined their daughters birthday by leaving, did I overreact?\n\nnote: My daughter only knew the birthday girl at the party while the other children all knew each other because they were all longtime childhood friends.\n\nBefore I left I asked why they would do this in private and the family has denfended their actions by trying to explain that some people have driven hours to attend the party and that their daughter was spending all her time with my daughter which was unfair for the others.\n\nEdit: I have now cut contact with the family in question.

The parent's prioritized the other children over yours, and you prioritized yours over theirs. Nothing wrong with that.

There were plenty of ways to solve the problem of two kids speaking in English without banishing one from the party. You were clearly there, so why not ask you to gently pull your daughter aside and chat to her about making sure the birthday girl had a chance to interact with all of her guests?", "NTA but you failed to give your daughter a second language that could have given her enormous advantage, better understanding of her unique heritage as well as prevented such occurrences. For her you will be TA in the future as she will compare herself with bilingual kids whose parents have not missed this opportunity for their children.", "NTA", ">I have now cut contact with the family in question\n\nThis is the way.\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Poor litttle bubba... I hope she'll be ok.", "NTA you stuck by your child. theyre the assholes for isolating a child fro other kids at a birthday party.", "But she will, at some times in her life, have to tolerate situations that make her anxious or uncomfortable. Everyone does.\n\nMore to the point, in this case she was insulted and belittled by arrogant nobodies. *That* is something no one needs to tolerate, and OP was right to remove her from their proximity.", "INFO\n\nWhy were they mad that you left?   \nThey decided to remove your daughter from the party, you merely increased the distance.", "How could the party have been ruined by you leaving?  They sent you away from the party!\n\nThey need some way to feel less guilty about they passive-aggressive actions.  You brought up some great alternatives.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your vacation!!", "NTA - it\u2019s shockingly rude to isolate a kid like that just because of a language barrier.  Honestly good for you for teaching your daughter how to stand up for yourself", "NTA. Excellent response, both leaving and cutting the family in question.", "NTA  \nAnd no, you did not overreact - I would have reacted a lot stronger myself...", "NTA for leaving when your daughter wanted (assuming you didn\u2019t cause a scene on the way out.)\n\nWhile the family went about it the wrong way by sending your daughter away, why didn\u2019t you step in when you say your daughter excluding the other kids and monopolizing the birthday girl? Maybe the birthday girl was feeling upset and conflicted that she wanted to interact with everyone but instead felt obligated to \u201cbabysit\u201d your daughter.  They didn\u2019t handle it well, but neither did you.", "NTA - I saw you updated that you cut contact with the family, that was the correct response.", "Wait, does the birthday girl and your daughter speak Korean? Do you encourage her to speak Korean? What the parents did was bad, but like, you're in Korea at a Korean birthday, you should speak Korean and follow Korean culture.\n\nEsh", "NTA, the parents 'ruined' the party by isolating a child and sending her off to be alone", "Leaving early was the right move but all the adults here, including OP, seem to lack social skills. \n\nSounds like OP's daughter was monopolizing the bday girl and impeding her from fully enjoying her own party. The parents handled it very poorly but they were probably trying to extract bday girl from a difficult situation. It doesn't sound like these two are besties and bday girl actually wanted to be glued to OP's daughter.\n\nGoing to a party where you only know the host and don't really speak the language is going to be awkward. OP should have been checking in on her kid regularly and had an excuse ready to go as to why they needed to leave early if daughter looked to be having a bad time or was acting inappropriately (not allowing bday girl to socialize with others is inappropriate, though I don't' blame a nervous 10yo for not recognizing that)\n\nThe lesson here isn't to run from anything that makes you uncomfortable but to set yourself up for success and have a good exit strategy if things aren't working out. ESH except the kids.", "Why would itsuck for the birthday girl? birthday girls parent had olready removedOP's daughter from the party, OP just extended the distance a bit.", "They were mad because they supposedly only intended to keep her isolated for a little bit and also mad because they couldn\u2019t understand why my daughter was so upset.", "We immigrated to America when she was only 2 years old but we try to speak Korean at home and have her also enrolled in a Korean class. She can understand and speak the language just not as fluently. We are trying our best :)", "And how come they theught it was OK to punish your daughter, with you present, for speaking english?"]}
