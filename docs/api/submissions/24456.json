Yesterday, my daughter F10 and me M36 attended our close family friends daughters birthday party. My daughter Korean is not very fluent so she was talking with her friend (the birthday girl) in english as the other family also immigrated to america but is staying in korea. The other children at the party were all Korean kids who were former classmates of the birthday girl. After a bit the parents of the birthday girl made my daughter go upstairs away from and essentially kicking her out of the party because she was apparently distracting the birthday girl from the other children by speaking in english. They said that she was making the other children feel  left out and that the birthday girl was only talking to my daughter in english and sent her upstairs while the other children had fun without her. My daughter was very upset, uncomfortable, and wanted to leave so i drove her home. Now the family is not talking to me. what angers me is that the parents could have simply asked the my daughter to stop speaking in english (which I would have understood) but instead choose to isolate my daughter. Now the family is saying that i ruined their daughters birthday by leaving, did I overreact?\n\nnote: My daughter only knew the birthday girl at the party while the other children all knew each other because they were all longtime childhood friends.\n\nThe family has denfended their actions by trying to explain that some people have driven hours to attend the party and that their daughter was spending all her time with my daughter which was unfair for the others.\n\nEdit: I have now cut contact with the family in question", "created_utc": 1691823794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15oxi0x/aita_for_leaving_a_childs_birthday_party_abruptly/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The parent's prioritized the other children over yours, and you prioritized yours over theirs. Nothing wrong with that.
