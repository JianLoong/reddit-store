There were plenty of ways to solve the problem of two kids speaking in English without banishing one from the party. You were clearly there, so why not ask you to gently pull your daughter aside and chat to her about making sure the birthday girl had a chance to interact with all of her guests?", "NTA but you failed to give your daughter a second language that could have given her enormous advantage, better understanding of her unique heritage as well as prevented such occurrences. For her you will be TA in the future as she will compare herself with bilingual kids whose parents have not missed this opportunity for their children.", "NTA", ">I have now cut contact with the family in question\n\nThis is the way.\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Poor litttle bubba... I hope she'll be ok.", "NTA you stuck by your child. theyre the assholes for isolating a child fro other kids at a birthday party.", "But she will, at some times in her life, have to tolerate situations that make her anxious or uncomfortable. Everyone does.\n\nMore to the point, in this case she was insulted and belittled by arrogant nobodies. *That* is something no one needs to tolerate, and OP was right to remove her from their proximity.", "INFO\n\nWhy were they mad that you left?   \nThey decided to remove your daughter from the party, you merely increased the distance.", "How could the party have been ruined by you leaving?  They sent you away from the party!\n\nThey need some way to feel less guilty about they passive-aggressive actions.  You brought up some great alternatives.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your vacation!!", "NTA - it\u2019s shockingly rude to isolate a kid like that just because of a language barrier.  Honestly good for you for teaching your daughter how to stand up for yourself", "NTA. Excellent response, both leaving and cutting the family in question.", "NTA  \nAnd no, you did not overreact - I would have reacted a lot stronger myself...", "NTA for leaving when your daughter wanted (assuming you didn\u2019t cause a scene on the way out.)\n\nWhile the family went about it the wrong way by sending your daughter away, why didn\u2019t you step in when you say your daughter excluding the other kids and monopolizing the birthday girl? Maybe the birthday girl was feeling upset and conflicted that she wanted to interact with everyone but instead felt obligated to \u201cbabysit\u201d your daughter.  They didn\u2019t handle it well, but neither did you.", "NTA - I saw you updated that you cut contact with the family, that was the correct response.", "Wait, does the birthday girl and your daughter speak Korean? Do you encourage her to speak Korean? What the parents did was bad, but like, you're in Korea at a Korean birthday, you should speak Korean and follow Korean culture.\n\nEsh", "NTA, the parents 'ruined' the party by isolating a child and sending her off to be alone", "Leaving early was the right move but all the adults here, including OP, seem to lack social skills. \n\nSounds like OP's daughter was monopolizing the bday girl and impeding her from fully enjoying her own party. The parents handled it very poorly but they were probably trying to extract bday girl from a difficult situation. It doesn't sound like these two are besties and bday girl actually wanted to be glued to OP's daughter.\n\nGoing to a party where you only know the host and don't really speak the language is going to be awkward. OP should have been checking in on her kid regularly and had an excuse ready to go as to why they needed to leave early if daughter looked to be having a bad time or was acting inappropriately (not allowing bday girl to socialize with others is inappropriate, though I don't' blame a nervous 10yo for not recognizing that)\n\nThe lesson here isn't to run from anything that makes you uncomfortable but to set yourself up for success and have a good exit strategy if things aren't working out. ESH except the kids.", "Why would itsuck for the birthday girl? birthday girls parent had olready removedOP's daughter from the party, OP just extended the distance a bit.", "They were mad because they supposedly only intended to keep her isolated for a little bit and also mad because they couldn\u2019t understand why my daughter was so upset.", "We immigrated to America when she was only 2 years old but we try to speak Korean at home and have her also enrolled in a Korean class. She can understand and speak the language just not as fluently. We are trying our best :)", "And how come they theught it was OK to punish your daughter, with you present, for speaking english?", "NTA\u2014Bullying under the guise of collectivism. Well done for swiftly removing your daughter from this rude situation of being othered. The other kiddos\u2019 parents were probably jealous of her English skills as well.", "NTA. They basically invited your daughter to a party to ground her. That\u2019s insane.", "NTA There are probably about a million ways they could have solved the problem. The most obvious of which would have been saying, \"Hey girls, let's play a game with everyone.\" \n\nBut it's excruciatingly apparent these people only cared about saving face and not at all about any of the children's feelings or their developing social skills, so their reaction is totally unsurprising. \n\nDon't take you kid around them anymore as they see her as more of a prop that can be put away when inconvenient than as a person.", "This is an example of how xenophobic/racist Asia can be. Source also from an Asian background", "You did the right thing. Well done Dad", "They removed your daughter from the party, so you removed your daughter from the situation. For them to be mad makes zero sense.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nThe bday girl's parents' actions were outrageous.\n\nHow did you ruin the party by taking home a child *who wasn't allowed at the party*? The bday girl wad probably upset when she realized your daughter wasn't there, and then her parents blamed you instead of admitting that they'd kicked her out.\n\nIt's unfortunate for the two girls, but it's all on bday girl's parents.", "They were embarrassed at having everyone notoce they were mean to a little girl and then had to try and explain away to their own kid why her friend was leaving. They wanted to be quietly cruel to save face with their other guests and instead were exposed as bad hosts in front of everyone.", "OP said his daughter is not very fluent in Korean so forcing her to speak only in Korean would likely have made his Daughter uncomfortable as well. The other kids might have even made fun of her for not speaking well. It\u2019s a lose-lose situation but I don\u2019t think exiling a child from the party is the best approach.", "[removed]", "This is how I interpret it as well. OPs daughter was in my opinion being rude. The parents I think were trying not to be rude to the other guests but really messed up on their method Ana ended up being rude to OPs daughter they should have done a quiet correction to their kid and drawn her away or spoken to OP since she wasn\u2019t stopping it. OP should have been a bit more attentive to the situation so that she could intervene. It\u2019s not ok to pull the birthday girl into a 1:1 conversation for an entire party while the other guests just get ignored. And I have a hard time blaming the birthday girl too much because she probably didn\u2019t know what to do.", "Ok but as the adult, you should have reminded your child that she is one guest and it\u2019s not right to monopolize her hosts attention", "??? She could only understand English and who says that OPs daughter started the convo\n\nOP, NTA", "Ya, exactly! I understood it as the bday girl really liked and wanted to hang out with OP's daughter, and the parents tried to stop it by sending OP's daughter away. So, why stay at a party you're not allowed to be at? And then why would they get angry they left when they weren't allowed to attend/be present? OP is NTA.", "Her only understanding English doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok to use up all the time and attention of the birthday girl. In a similar situation, where I visited family and they had a party, I gave my cousin some space to hang with her local friends too because they are guests as well, not just me. It would have been rude to keep up a conversation no one else could participate in.", "I get that but why are the hosts angry that OP left, then?", "Because that made things even more awkward because it drew the attention of the other guests. Everyone I know in seoul/incheon has a small house by NA standards. It's not really possible to keep something like this private in the moment. \n\nThe host parents behaved poorly here but yeah it's embarrassing for them.  Op didn't  do her part to stop daughter from monopolizing bdsy girl so she comes off poorly here too", "You seem totally over dramatic here. I get why this was hurtful but you should have just told your daughter to do her best with Korean. Cutting contact seems drastic based on this alone. ESH", "How can your daughter ruin the part by being there, and ruin the party by leaving, at the same time? Those people make no sense. NTA", "NTA and this doesn't make sense.\nThey wanted your daughter out. \nThey sent her out. \nWhat's the difference if she's out of the party by being upstairs or out of the party by going home? \nIf the party was ruined by your daughter leaving, then it was ruined by the people who made her leave, not the person who changed the location of the leaving.", "NTA they were pretty rude themselves, and mean to your daughter.", "NTA", "I don\u2019t even have kids so this is purely hypothetical, but I imagine I would\u2019ve got my daughter out of there the moment I learned she\u2019d been sent upstairs \u201calone\u201d in house full of kids and adults. (I\u2019m also imagining that whoever drove hours to get there stayed for the party.)\n\nAsking that everyone please speak Korean so that everyone can participate would\u2018ve been a simple and fair solution. Intentionally isolating a child in a house full of strangers is extremely problematic. How does anyone think that\u2019s okay?  (I\u2019ve been thru some things, so maybe it\u2019s just me, but\u2026.no.)\n\nNTA", "NTA. As you pointed out there were other options that did not involve isolating your daughter. And since the birthday girl was the only one she knew, she probably would have been interacting mainly with her whatever the language.", "I wonder if the parents wanted to wait until after their guests left to bring your daughter back out to entertain birthday girl for a while longer", "The other parents are right that if your daughter kept speaking in English it would ruin the party for the other kids. Also your daughter is only going to learn by practicing Korean including outside the classroom.\n\nWhen you take her to visit relatives or anyone you need to talk her through it in the car/beforehand and explain how much English she can use. \n\nIf it's exhausting her then plan shorter visits. She should also learn some card games/board games so she can feel like she's joining in without needing a lot of language skills. \n\nNote, I'm not agreeing with how they handled it or how they upset your kid, but your kid can't cling on to English and English speaking friends forever unless you are moving back to the US in the next few years. You can explain it in a gentler way than other parents.\n\nIs she speaking Korean at home or only listening.", "NTA.  Your job is to look out for your daughter.  Job well done.", "NTA.  They isolated your daughter.  Cut her out.  That is extremely rude.  And majorly disrespectful.  I would have left too.  And let them know.  In no uncertain terms.  How rude and disrespectful they were.   \n    \nHell.  Something like this.  I would tag them on social media.  Just to embarrass them more.", "NTA - you did what you had to do \" I have now cut contact with the family in question.\"", "NTA. How did it ruin the party for their daughter when she was with several friends from school? I am sure that somehow she swallowed her grief and still managed to have a good time.\n\nHow cruel to isolate your child.\n\nTeach your kid to speak fluent Korean. Learning other languages is always an asset.", "[removed]", "> Because that made things even more awkward because it drew the attention of the other guests.\n\nAwesome.
