{"id": 30830, "submission_id": "17thhxy", "title": "AITA for not serving my bf dinner?", "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I (21F) have been going through a bit of a situation with my boyfriend (21M) recently, and I'm not sure if I'm the one in the wrong here. I technically live on campus, but I've been staying at his apartment most of the time. Lately, I've been taking on most of the cooking duties, while he helps with cleaning.\n\nThe other day, I made dinner (quesadillas) and offered to make some for him. He declined and said he wasn't hungry. So, I went ahead and made my quesadilla and ate it. Later, around 12:30 AM, I went to the room and asked him again if he wanted dinner. He said he did, but he'd make it himself.\n\nAround 2 AM, he came into the room, mentioning that he was hungry. I told him to go ahead and eat something. He got upset with me for not going back to ask him to eat or making it for him. We ended up arguing, and in the heat of the moment, I called him annoying. He's blown this up into a big issue.\n\nHe claims that since I usually do most of the cooking, it's my responsibility to put the quesadillas together and serve them to him. I found this a bit frustrating and left the room. So, Reddit, AITA here?", "created_utc": 1699784639, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17thhxy/aita_for_not_serving_my_bf_dinner/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But stop spending most of your time at his appartment. He seems to think that he now has a live-in mother. As a student, you don't need that.", "NTA\n\nTypical escalating behavior from your BF.  He makes an unreasonable demand.  You decline.  He pushes the issue. You are honest and call him out and state he is being annoying.  He immediately makes you out to be the bad person and takes no responsibility for initiating the whole argument and blows it up into a big deal in an attempt to force you into apologizing when you did nothing wrong and to get you to give in to his unreasonable demand.\n\nWhere exactly is the love, empathy, support, and willingness to de escalate and resolve issues calmly?  \n\nIf boyfriend has a pattern of being controlling and abusive and is unwilling to accept your opinions and boundaries it may be time to re evaluate the relationship.", "NTA what we\u2019re supposed to do? Cook the food and let it go cold? Does he expect you to hand feed him too when he\u2019s acting like a fussy baby? Let this be a lesson to him: if you wait to eat at 2am, you\u2019re going to act like cranky baby and be called out for it", "NTA. You offered to cook for him twice. He rejected your offer. He can now make his own food.", "NTA!!!!\n\nYou offered multiple times to make him dinner at a reasonable time. Then when it's inconvenient for you he gets upset with you for not making him dinner. It is OK that you have this division of labour if that is what works for you, however, you had made it clear when you were happy to be doing your share and he didn't take you up on that offer. Big NTA", "NTA. \"The kitchen is closed.\"", "NTA. You offered him twice. Being responsible for the cooking does not mean you are responsible for dropping everything any time he feels peckish. BF overplayed his hand and owes you an apology.", "NTA. Last I checked he\u2019s got legs and arms. So.", "I don't see how you could possibly be the AH here. You talked to him about dinner plans, he said he didn't want anything so you made dinner for just yourself. \n\nThen you again ask him a few hours later if he wanted something and he again tells not to do it and that he'll make himself something.\n\nThen two hours later he's mad that you didn't make anything... when he specifically told you not to make him anything? WTF is that about? \n\nAsking him the second time was more than was necessary for you to do. How were you supposed to even know to make him something when he specifically told you not to? If I told someone not to make me food and then they come back a bit later with food made for me, I would be unhappy because they didn't listen to what I clearly stated. It's hard to believe that any reasonable person would take \"I'm hungry but I'm going to make myself something, don't make anything for me\" as an invitation to make food and bring it to the person. This seems like some weird power trip game type of thing. \n\nAlso, you saying you do the cooking and he \"helps with the cleaning\" makes me feel like you are doing most of the cleaning and he \"helps a bit\", which if that's the case is appalling since it's his apartment so he should be responsible for the cleaning in it's entirety and you could maybe \"help a bit\" since you are there so often. But if the bulk of the cleaning in addition to most of the cooking is on you to do, that's kind of concerning especially with the situation that you described. It seems like he's getting you to do more and more things while he's doing less and less things.", "NTA\nHe woke you up at 2 am, and expects you to make him dinner?", "You\u2019re too young for this BS. NTA", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve been married for 25 years and my wife would divorce me if I tried this shit on her. She\u2019d kill me first though. \n\nYou definitely need to find another boyfriend who respects you and your time. You aren\u2019t his live-in cook/maid.", "Tell him that the kitchen is closed and if he wants some food outside of kitchen hours, he has to get it himself.\n\nIt's not like you wake him up at 3am to ask him to do an emergency load of laundry or to clean the bathroom.\n\nYou really need to rethink this relationship and figure out if your boyfriend is mature enough for you.\n\nYou deserve an equal partner, not to be treated like a substitute mom.\n\nVerdict : NTA", "NTA and from now you take turns cooking.", "This is an important pattern to set early.  You\u2019re not his maid.  He can get his own food.\n\nIt sets a standard of subservience to have to serve him.\n\nThe pattern you want to establish is that you each help each other out of love, but you\u2019re both capable.\n\nOnce you start this crap it won\u2019t ever end.", "NTA.\n\nCooking for 2 ppl isn't really more work than for one, so it makes sense when one person in a relationship drifts into being \"the cook\". \n\nBut.\n\nIf you are cooking the same meal at 2 separate times, it is no longer \"as easy\" and becomes downright annoying.\n\nI am \"the cook\" in my relationship (hubby does the dishes). If I'm making dinner and he isn't hungry, I'll ask if he wants a plate for later (waiting in microwave or fridge) or if he's going to just scavenge. I do not cook again later, especially not past bedtime.", "You made dinner, offered to make him some, he declined. You later ask if he wants dinner and he says he does but he\u2019ll make it. Then later he is upset because he still hadn\u2019t followed through with what he said and is now upset you\u2019re his gf and not his chef, his mom, or a mind reader? Obviously NTA.", "NTA, but I think you got confused when writing his age? He's clearly 12, not 21.", "You initially asked out of courtesy it\u2019s not your responsibility to feed him especially after he has declined once and specified he would handle it himself if he did get hungry later on. NTA", "NTA and ew to your bf. Ya he should take on the cleaning, it\u2019s his apartment. Imo you can be a respectful house guest (maybe make the bed, clean your dishes once in a while, don\u2019t leave your stuff everywhere) but until you\u2019re living together it\u2019s still his apartment and his duties, including cooking! And him specially using the term \u201cserve him?\u201d ICK\n\nHow about from now on you do none of the cooking. You\u2019re a guest, guests don\u2019t do chores. And boohoo you called him annoying, well he was being annoying. It\u2019s not like you swore at him or were outrageously mean. \n\nId tell him you\u2019re concerned that at his age of 21 he can\u2019t figure out how to make a quesadilla. Even to make a crappy one you just put shredded cheese in a tortilla, fold it in half and microwave it for 30 seconds. That\u2019s a perfect 2 am meal.", "NTA but your boyfriend has given you a scary glimpse of what he'd be like as a long term partner. Take the warning and bail now.", "NTA \"I'll make it myself\" means just that. You can't get mad later that nobody cooked for you.", "Exactly. At 8, he needs to learn that there are meal times, not an all day buffet service.", "And he's too old for this BS. NTA", "And if the 8 year old can comprehend that, so can OPs bf"]}
