{"id": 30830, "submission_id": "17thhxy", "title": "AITA for not serving my bf dinner?", "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I (21F) have been going through a bit of a situation with my boyfriend (21M) recently, and I'm not sure if I'm the one in the wrong here. I technically live on campus, but I've been staying at his apartment most of the time. Lately, I've been taking on most of the cooking duties, while he helps with cleaning.\n\nThe other day, I made dinner (quesadillas) and offered to make some for him. He declined and said he wasn't hungry. So, I went ahead and made my quesadilla and ate it. Later, around 12:30 AM, I went to the room and asked him again if he wanted dinner. He said he did, but he'd make it himself.\n\nAround 2 AM, he came into the room, mentioning that he was hungry. I told him to go ahead and eat something. He got upset with me for not going back to ask him to eat or making it for him. We ended up arguing, and in the heat of the moment, I called him annoying. He's blown this up into a big issue.\n\nHe claims that since I usually do most of the cooking, it's my responsibility to put the quesadillas together and serve them to him. I found this a bit frustrating and left the room. So, Reddit, AITA here?", "created_utc": 1699784639, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17thhxy/aita_for_not_serving_my_bf_dinner/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But stop spending most of your time at his appartment. He seems to think that he now has a live-in mother. As a student, you don't need that.", "NTA\n\nTypical escalating behavior from your BF.  He makes an unreasonable demand.  You decline.  He pushes the issue. You are honest and call him out and state he is being annoying.  He immediately makes you out to be the bad person and takes no responsibility for initiating the whole argument and blows it up into a big deal in an attempt to force you into apologizing when you did nothing wrong and to get you to give in to his unreasonable demand.\n\nWhere exactly is the love, empathy, support, and willingness to de escalate and resolve issues calmly?  \n\nIf boyfriend has a pattern of being controlling and abusive and is unwilling to accept your opinions and boundaries it may be time to re evaluate the relationship.", "NTA what were you supposed to do? Cook the food and let it go cold? Does he expect you to hand feed him too when he\u2019s acting like a fussy baby? Let this be a lesson to him: if you wait to eat at 2am, you\u2019re going to act like cranky baby and be called out for it", "NTA. You offered to cook for him twice. He rejected your offer. He can now make his own food.", "NTA!!!!\n\nYou offered multiple times to make him dinner at a reasonable time. Then when it's inconvenient for you he gets upset with you for not making him dinner. It is OK that you have this division of labour if that is what works for you, however, you had made it clear when you were happy to be doing your share and he didn't take you up on that offer. Big NTA", "NTA. \"The kitchen is closed.\"", "NTA. You offered him twice. Being responsible for the cooking does not mean you are responsible for dropping everything any time he feels peckish. BF overplayed his hand and owes you an apology.", "NTA. Last I checked he\u2019s got legs and arms. So.", "I don't see how you could possibly be the AH here. You talked to him about dinner plans, he said he didn't want anything so you made dinner for just yourself. \n\nThen you again ask him a few hours later if he wanted something and he again tells not to do it and that he'll make himself something.\n\nThen two hours later he's mad that you didn't make anything... when he specifically told you not to make him anything? WTF is that about? \n\nAsking him the second time was more than was necessary for you to do. How were you supposed to even know to make him something when he specifically told you not to? If I told someone not to make me food and then they come back a bit later with food made for me, I would be unhappy because they didn't listen to what I clearly stated. It's hard to believe that any reasonable person would take \"I'm hungry but I'm going to make myself something, don't make anything for me\" as an invitation to make food and bring it to the person. This seems like some weird power trip game type of thing. \n\nAlso, you saying you do the cooking and he \"helps with the cleaning\" makes me feel like you are doing most of the cleaning and he \"helps a bit\", which if that's the case is appalling since it's his apartment so he should be responsible for the cleaning in it's entirety and you could maybe \"help a bit\" since you are there so often. But if the bulk of the cleaning in addition to most of the cooking is on you to do, that's kind of concerning especially with the situation that you described. It seems like he's getting you to do more and more things while he's doing less and less things.", "NTA\nHe woke you up at 2 am, and expects you to make him dinner?", "You\u2019re too young for this BS. NTA", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve been married for 25 years and my wife would divorce me if I tried this shit on her. She\u2019d kill me first though. \n\nYou definitely need to find another boyfriend who respects you and your time. You aren\u2019t his live-in cook/maid.", "Tell him that the kitchen is closed and if he wants some food outside of kitchen hours, he has to get it himself.\n\nIt's not like you wake him up at 3am to ask him to do an emergency load of laundry or to clean the bathroom.\n\nYou really need to rethink this relationship and figure out if your boyfriend is mature enough for you.\n\nYou deserve an equal partner, not to be treated like a substitute mom.\n\nVerdict : NTA", "NTA and from now you take turns cooking.", "This is an important pattern to set early.  You\u2019re not his maid.  He can get his own food.\n\nIt sets a standard of subservience to have to serve him.\n\nThe pattern you want to establish is that you each help each other out of love, but you\u2019re both capable.\n\nOnce you start this crap it won\u2019t ever end.", "NTA.\n\nCooking for 2 ppl isn't really more work than for one, so it makes sense when one person in a relationship drifts into being \"the cook\". \n\nBut.\n\nIf you are cooking the same meal at 2 separate times, it is no longer \"as easy\" and becomes downright annoying.\n\nI am \"the cook\" in my relationship (hubby does the dishes). If I'm making dinner and he isn't hungry, I'll ask if he wants a plate for later (waiting in microwave or fridge) or if he's going to just scavenge. I do not cook again later, especially not past bedtime.", "You made dinner, offered to make him some, he declined. You later ask if he wants dinner and he says he does but he\u2019ll make it. Then later he is upset because he still hadn\u2019t followed through with what he said and is now upset you\u2019re his gf and not his chef, his mom, or a mind reader? Obviously NTA.", "NTA, but I think you got confused when writing his age? He's clearly 12, not 21.", "You initially asked out of courtesy it\u2019s not your responsibility to feed him especially after he has declined once and specified he would handle it himself if he did get hungry later on. NTA", "NTA and ew to your bf. Ya he should take on the cleaning, it\u2019s his apartment. Imo you can be a respectful house guest (maybe make the bed, clean your dishes once in a while, don\u2019t leave your stuff everywhere) but until you\u2019re living together it\u2019s still his apartment and his duties, including cooking! And him specially using the term \u201cserve him?\u201d ICK\n\nHow about from now on you do none of the cooking. You\u2019re a guest, guests don\u2019t do chores. And boohoo you called him annoying, well he was being annoying. It\u2019s not like you swore at him or were outrageously mean. \n\nId tell him you\u2019re concerned that at his age of 21 he can\u2019t figure out how to make a quesadilla. Even to make a crappy one you just put shredded cheese in a tortilla, fold it in half and microwave it for 30 seconds. That\u2019s a perfect 2 am meal.", "NTA but your boyfriend has given you a scary glimpse of what he'd be like as a long term partner. Take the warning and bail now.", "NTA \"I'll make it myself\" means just that. You can't get mad later that nobody cooked for you.", "Exactly. At 8, he needs to learn that there are meal times, not an all day buffet service.", "And he's too old for this BS. NTA", "And if the 8 year old can comprehend that, so can OPs bf", "Slowly start distancing yourself from him and his apartment... red flags are starting to wave", "So you do most of the cooking and your boyfriend 'helps' with doing his own housework-I would move back to campus asap. You are NTA but your boyfriend is.", "NTA. You offered, he declined. It\u2019s his responsibility to feed himself.", "NTA.\n\nDude, run. There are 2837572829 partners out there that don't do shit like this.", "NTA. He is annoying. \n\n>I went to the room and asked him again if he wanted dinner. He said he did, but he'd make it himself.\n\n>He claims that since I usually do most of the cooking, it's my responsibility to put the quesadillas together and serve them to him.\n\nThat\u2019s worse than annoying, that insanity. How can you live like that?", "Dump this misogynist. You twice asked if he wanted dinner and he said no. You're not a short order cook and have no obligation to cook on demand. He's rude, lazy and entitled. This won't get better.", "Obviously NTA for dinner. But what stood out to me was that you said he helped with cleaning. He helps with cleaning his own place? Not your shared place, his place.", "He thinks you are his mom", "If *anyone* woke me up at 2am demanding food (except a baby I was breastfeeding) I'd tell them where to go shove it. The president could wake me up at 2am asking for food and I'd still tell him to fuck off.\n\nWhat home do people grow up in where they get this level of entitled? Did their moms seriously wake up at 2 to make them sandwiches? ...I kind of doubt it.", "He doesn't \"help\" clean his apartment - it's his apartment to clean, thus his responsibility.", "Yta.", "NTA. You asked more than once, and he declined. He's a grown ass man and should be able to make himself something to eat when he's hungry.", "You offered and he said \u201cI\u2019ll make it myself\u201d - end of story, all the rest is him just creating drama. NTA", "[removed]", "lol what?! NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell that sexist AH to find some other servant.", "NTA. But you set yourself up by staying over there all the time. Immature guys tend to think live in GF means live in maid, cook, and s*x slave.", "NTA, he is expecting you to serve him?  Are you a waitress?  His personal valet?  OR. . . .  Are you his mommy?", "NTA you asked him a couple of times if he wanted dinner and even offered his quesadillas. He communicated he could make something himself. It\u2019s not your job to continuously ask him, he\u2019s a grown man he can make his own food especially when he told you he was going to. He\u2019s treating you like a maid and it isn\u2019t okay.", "NTA\n\nNext time he demands food, pur\u00e9e it for him like the giant baby that he is", "[removed]", "NTA and I would move back to campus and seriously rethink the relationship. He wants a bang maid not an equal partner.", "Um, yea\u2026.\u201di left the room\u201d keep walking as far as you can!!!!", "NTA but ..... Welcome to your future.", ">I've been staying at his apartment most of the time. Lately, I've been taking on most of the cooking duties, while **he helps with cleaning**.\n\nWhoa, back up.  It's his apartment.  He shouldn't help with the cleaning.  He should be the one cleaning his apartment while you help him out.  The attitude that guys help with cleaning, as if they're being good if they do anything other than make their GFs do it all for them, is why your BF demands things like you drop everything to feed him at 2am.", "NTA what is this, the 1950s? Make your own damn food AT 2 AM and let the girl sleep.", "NTA. But you might be the AH if you ignore this field of red flags. It\u2019s HIS apartment, and he \u201cHELPS\u201d with the cleaning???????", "NTA, your boyfriend is the kind of man who gives all men a bad name.  He and they think of us women as mothers,  maids, chefs and sex slaves! I wouldn't be with someone like that,  tell him to get his head out of his a@@ or leave him cause it won't get better.", "NTA\n\nHe actually \"helps\" with the cleaning of his own apartment?  How very gracious of him.  \n\nYou offered twice.  This is a terrible pattern that is forming.", "NTA: Seriously? Really? After asking him multiple times and offering him food and him saying no thanks he\u2019ll get it?? You need to really think about this one; you are waaaaaay too young to be dealing with this.", "Don't forget that's after he said he'd make it... That's the real kicker here.  Not only does he expect her to be his short order chef at late hours, but is doing so after he explicitly said he would do it.", "How so? This isn't medieval times anymore, if you're a grown ass adult and you're hungry, get your own damn food", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
