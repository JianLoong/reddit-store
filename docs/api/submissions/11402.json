We have 4 kids (7M, 4F, 2F and 1mo M). Yes we were teen parents but that's not relevant to the story.\n\n8 years ago, when I first got pregnant I wasn't in a relationship with my husband so my family had no idea who he was. While my mom was supportive about us as a couple, my dad had an issue. He's always been a racist and I always fought with him over it as I'm the opposite of all his opinions. \n\nNow when he found out I was pregnant, he was mad enough but he was even more mad when he saw the father. He started calling him slurs and it was really awful so for the 9 months I didn't see him but stupidly wanted to give him a chance to meet his grandson.\n\nObviously my kids are mixed race, but at the newborn stage they are just a bit lighter in general.\n\nMy dad saw the light skin tone on my son and started to convince himself and other people that I didn't sleep with an (slur) and that my son isn't one too. This really pissed me off that I stormed out and sent him a text explaining unless he fully changes his outlook on my family, he won't see me or my kid. I blocked him on social media except I kept his number. My parents are divorced so until we could afford our own life we lived with my mom.\n\nWell it's been 8 years since then and I've never been happier with my family. I have the most gorgeous kids and the most loving husband. We make silly tiktoks every once in a while and one of our videos went slightly viral, it was me and my son singing a song. \n\n2 days after that tiktok was posted I get a message from my dad. A long one explaining that he saw my tiktok of me and my son and really misses me. He found out about my other kids then too because I made my brothers promise that they don't give any information on me to my dad when they saw him. I'm very bitter about the past but I know people change so I went back and forth over text for a week and they yesterday I decided to call him to figure things out.\n\nWe spoke things out and it seemed to be going well until he told me \"I may not like their color or smell but I deserve to meet my grandkids. They are cute which is shocking for kids of a (slur)\". I lost it and hung up the phone call immediately. No way am I letting such an awful man around my children, when they already will have to grow up in a world that doesn't always accept them. They deserve a better childhood then I had. I sent my dad a long message saying how disgusting of a human he was for saying that about his own grandchildren, how he would never see me or my kids.\n\nMy brothers are telling me I am over reacting and saying \"Its dad, you get what you can with him.\" Even from my mom she tells me that my dad will never be perfect but he's trying and he does love you. I refused all this and now they are all saying I am ruining my children's chances of having another grandparent, as to them my dad's words are an improvement.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677877599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hey8n/aita_for_not_letting_my_racist_dad_meet_my_kids/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father is especially cruel for saying those things to you about your husband - the man you chose to marry and the father of your children.

He\u2019s a racist. NTA keep your kids away from that bigot!", "NTA!!! Their smell? Crikey that is awful.

We live in a deeply racist society that is unforgiving to people of color. While you can't protect your family from every racist, you sure can protect them from this one. Also, if your siblings and your mom are glossing over the vile and disgusting things you father lives and breathes for the sake of familial duty, then they're siding with a loud and proud racist.

Your kids don't need to be exposed to that garbage.  \n\nAnd no, he's not trying despite what your mom says.  That's not trying - it's just regret over pushing you away.

People like that cling onto the hatred in their heart and it's gotta be so exhausting. I can tell you adore your little ones!", "Exactly. Sounds like you know your gut is right! I\u2019m so sorry for your son\u2019s experience. I hope he can see all the beautiful black and mixed race folk out there in the world as examples and recognise that he is incredible just the way he is!", "I'm so sorry for your situation, and can't possibly imagine how hard it has been to come to terms with. You're kids are very lucky to have a mother willing to protect them like you have though, no Grandparent \"deserves\" to meet their grandchildren regardless of how they behave.", "Yup, you are right to protect your kids from being in a toxic environment", "Ah, I see now. That's a messed-up mentality to have, for sure. And you're right; I've never encountered someone as bad as this guy, thankfully. The racism I've heard (in person, not online) was definitely not this severe. ~~Not that that makes it any more acceptable. Racism on any level is horrible.~~ I can't imagine having a person like that in the family.", "The \"they're cute\" was very much a \"I'm shocked they are cute because this is their skin color.\" Blatent racism hidden in a \"compliment\"", "I don't blame you! I honestly think it'd be *more* hurtful hearing something like that from their family than a stranger. An ignorant stranger you can write off. Family is supposed to provide love, so it's a double whammy when you hear that. \n\nYou're doing right by your kids.", "Yeah know they know exactly how bad the things the father says.\n\nYour family is not living in a cave.  \n\nThey have the internet. \n\nI am sure there are POC in their area that they have to interact with or see other people interact with\n\nYour family....on some level...agrees with your father\n\nThat is why none of them will stand up to him on your behalf", "Hows the inlaws? Get them on the account....", "Only GOD can change a man. Only then if he wants to be changed. Your children are surrounded by all the love they need. Best wishes!", "OP, you've done a great job of protecting your family by cutting off your dad but please remember the insidious nature of racism. Sometimes it's not an out right slur to your face but a whisper in your ear that \"it's not *that* bad\" or \"they don't mean it like *that*\" or even \"but they've got a good heart\" from people you may love and trust. Stay strong and don't waiver even if it's a friendly face telling you to just \"let it go\" and make peace. The people that will suffer most if you do are your kids and husband.", "If you truly love your children, you'll cut ties and never look back. They'll face things you can never understand. They don't need grandpa bigot around them.", "Burn that bridge.  If he make some miraculous hallmark channel after dark recover, so be it.  I wouldn't even honor him by calling him dad/father.  When your kids are old enough for the racism chat, don't let them refer to him as anything grandfatherly.. Just let him be known as \"Racist $FirstName\".\n\nGood luck!  Sorry that you and yours have to deal with this.", "Your mother and brother are wrong.  Period.  No discussion.  Do not let him around your children.  Protect them.  You don't owe dad anything, and he doesn't deserve it.\n\nPerhaps if you don't let him see your kids, he may see the error of his ways.  If there is no consequence (letting dad have a relationship with the grandchildren), he will never see what he is saying as wrong.\n\nNTA", "Disclosure- bw married to wm, 2 children.  Not around racists folks at all.  You can imagine your dad saying something like - never though I\u2019d be related to n*.  Or rubbing their hair for good luck.  As adults, your siblings can tolerate your dads\u2019 attitude, but do not damage your children by allowing them around him.  Watch out that your siblings don\u2019t take the kids behind your back to meet him. NTA", "I adore them so much. My favourite humans", "A lot of black content creators have helped him feel much more comfortable in his skin. I want him to be able to go around feeling proud that he is mixed", "My inlaws? Because in that case they are ready to fight for their babies", "Thank you", "I understand this and I'm still learning so thank you", "I love my kids more then anything but I still loved my dad. He is my father. After 8 years it is possible for change. But he just couldn't change but some people do. I now know he can't change and I'm at peace with that. \n\nBut I love my kids more then life, nobody can take that away from me. I went into this very carefully and made sure he made no contact with them until I was fully sure but then I never got the chance as he screwed it up", "I dont feel bad for me. I feel bad for my kids. They are babies themselves and deserve to have family who fully love and support them. But they have one whole side (my dad's side) who just doesn't do that. It's so sad", "Thanks for this info.", "You should feel bad for yourself.  I imagine he wasn't a peach other \"than that one thing\".  Everyone deserves to have decent parents, but when we don't, all that's left for us to do, is to be better than what we had.  Sounds like your kids are set in that aspect :)", "I feel like I'm doing a good job with them. Their dad and I actually had so much \"beef\" in school and it's crazy now what life is like for us. He's the best dad they could ask for and he's also the best husband"]}
