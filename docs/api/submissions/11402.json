We have 4 kids (7M, 4F, 2F and 1mo M).

While my mom was supportive about us as a couple, my dad had an issue. He's always been a racist and I always fought with him over it as I'm the opposite of all his opinions. \n\nNow when he found out I was pregnant, he was mad enough but he was even more mad when he saw the father. He started calling him slurs and it was really awful so for the 9 months I didn't see him but stupidly wanted to give him a chance to meet his grandson.\n\nObviously my kids are mixed race, but at the newborn stage they are just a bit lighter in general.\n\nMy dad saw the light skin tone on my son and started to convince himself and other people that I didn't sleep with an (slur) and that my son isn't one too. This really pissed me off that I stormed out and sent him a text explaining unless he fully changes his outlook on my family, he won't see me or my kid. I blocked him on social media except I kept his number. My parents are divorced so until we could afford our own life we lived with my mom.\n\nWell it's been 8 years since then and I've never been happier with my family. I have the most gorgeous kids and the most loving husband. We make silly tiktoks every once in a while and one of our videos went slightly viral, it was me and my son singing a song. \n\n2 days after that tiktok was posted I get a message from my dad. A long one explaining that he saw my tiktok of me and my son and really misses me. He found out about my other kids then too because I made my brothers promise that they don't give any information on me to my dad when they saw him. I'm very bitter about the past but I know people change so I went back and forth over text for a week and they yesterday I decided to call him to figure things out.\n\nWe spoke things out and it seemed to be going well until he told me \"I may not like their color or smell but I deserve to meet my grandkids. They are cute which is shocking for kids of a (slur)\". I lost it and hung up the phone call immediately. No way am I letting such an awful man around my children, when they already will have to grow up in a world that doesn't always accept them. They deserve a better childhood then I had. I sent my dad a long message saying how disgusting of a human he was for saying that about his own grandchildren, how he would never see me or my kids.\n\nMy brothers are telling me I am over reacting and saying \"Its dad, you get what you can with him.\" Even from my mom she tells me that my dad will never be perfect but he's trying and he does love you. I refused all this and now they are all saying I am ruining my children's chances of having another grandparent, as to them my dad's words are an improvement.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677877599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hey8n/aita_for_not_letting_my_racist_dad_meet_my_kids/", "score": 637, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father is especially cruel for saying those things to you about your husband - the man you chose to marry and the father of your children.

He\u2019s a racist. NTA keep your kids away from that bigot!", "NTA!!! Their smell? Crikey that is awful.

We live in a deeply racist society that is unforgiving to people of color. While you can't protect your family from every racist, you sure can protect them from this one. Also, if your siblings and your mom are glossing over the vile and disgusting things you father lives and breathes for the sake of familial duty, then they're siding with a loud and proud racist.

Your kids don't need to be exposed to that garbage.  \n\nAnd no, he's not trying despite what your mom says.  That's not trying - it's just regret over pushing you away.

Also, your dad knows the words he is using are the absolute worst things one can say, I don\u2019t care how old he is, or where he came from. If he\u2019s been on tictok, he KNOWS. \n\nHe\u2019s put his need to spew hatred over you (his own daughter) and your children (ALSO his own grandchildren).\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to semi tolerate the occasional bad or racist statement (that doesn\u2019t include any derogatory words, but is racist in nature) as a \u201che\u2019s old, he\u2019s from \u2014\u2014, he doesn\u2019t realize that isn\u2019t right\u2026) even though personally I think that is all a bunch of BS and a big excuse for a person to say horrible things; it\u2019s quite another thing to allow those things to be said to one\u2019s children, let alone, the actual derogatory and horrifying words. \n\nStay strong, and don\u2019t let your siblings pressure you into a compromise. There is no compromise here.", "He might not like how they smell and people are saying give him another chance? \n\nNTA. Protect your beautiful family.", "Mixed Black kid with racist white family here.\n\nAnyone who associates with your dad is not to be trusted. My white family bleached my skin as an adolescent without telling me what they were doing. Even the quiet racists are dangerous and will undercut every ounce of self love your children possess.", "NTA - tell them they better grow up or you won't let your kids be around someone who supports racism", "NTA I suggest \"My kids are more important to me than Dad. We may not live in a world where I can protect them from all racists, but I can absolutely teach them that racists don't get to be involved in their private lives and that attitudes like that should be an immediate cut off. This isn't about Dad any more. This is about me teaching my kids how to value themselves and that they are worth protecting and that is more important than any feelings Dad has and any love I have for him.\"", "If he was trying, he would stop calling your children a slur.

Anyone enabling his racist behaviour is an A H.", "Wow he's also just leaving himself wide open. Does he not know that white people smell like sour milk?", "As a Black person, I am always learning new crazy things that people believe. Dude what? I would say a lot of Black people are very hygiene obsessed. Black men are more likely to groom themselves. Even rappers get pedicures. Lol. \n\nIts so absurd its funny \ud83d\ude02.", "Its especially important to protect your children during their formative years. It makes a huge difference as racism or prejudice is way easier to process when you have a good sense of self esteem and worth.

Even if he\u2019d called saying he\u2019s changed his views, you still wouldn\u2019t be TA if you didn\u2019t want him in your life, but what he said is fucking vile. You\u2019ve got you family.

Keep being a great mom.", "NTA\n\nYou just don't want your kids around someone who has that kind of mind set.\n\nYou did the right things back then and even now.

(I\u2019m a mom) What a thing to say. \n\nThis is not a potential grandpa. This is a potential bully. I hated my ah grandma. Hated how she talked to me. Hated how she talked to my brothers. Hated her. Hated my parents more for knowing what she was like and letting her in the house. \n\nNta.", "Yes, I'm sure your children are just aching for Grandpa Racist to be a part of their lives! Nah, he can fornicate off...if the best he can give is racist comments, then it ain't worth it. You are NTA.", "NTA my father is not a good person either. He was not a good father but I gave him a chance to be a good grandfather. He threw the chance away by, well, being himself. I cut all contact. My mom is dead, my FIL is dead, my son has only my MIL at this point in terms of grandparents. He doesn't remember his grandfather, and we live in the same city. I do get sad sometimes but it's the right thing to do. I know for a fact that my dad will hurt him in one way or another. He won't be a good influence and I couldn't trust him to take care of my son.", "NTA. \n\nYour bothers say you are over reacting because they are not black. You are doing everything correct. Keep that away from your kids if you can. But I would tell them when they are old enough to have a sit down conversation about it, they deserve to know. \n\nBasically your fam can kick rocks if they side with your father. \n\nTime for this attitude and thought process to die.

There can be no chance of him saying something derogatory towards them, you, or their father. He wants this relationship and it seems to me that desire has softened some of his views already. Stand your ground and force him to come to you on your terms.", "Agree fully. And yes literally my favourite thing to do is cuddle my kids after a bath and then just smell their fresh smell and I just love how unique they are and they smell like my babies. They all smell different and are all beautiful and smell way way WAY better then my dad who doesn't use deodorant. The fact he categorised them as 1 type really hurt me. They are individuals.", "Thank you \ud83d\udc97", "Thank you, I will always protect them", "It's been 8 years since I first told him and 7 years since he's seen my son. You would think that's enough time to change but no.", "I'm sorry you have to tell your son that. Its really hard raising my kids knowing there is people in this world who don't view them as human. I cant protect them forever and that scares me", "The words to my then kind of boyfriend (we hadn't established a relationship properly) hurt me because I like the guy a lot. But if he said that stuff to him now it would be out for me. Like fuck off dad", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "My dad is very narcissistic.

It's good to hear black people's opinions as they truly know how they would feel themselves and its so sad that people are so cruel. Thank you", "That last sentence lmao thank you", "Ikr it absolutely made me sick. They are more beautiful and smell so much better then he ever has. They smell like roses and he smells like B.O", "He does talk about them behind my back and everything. My brother told me the second I declined the call he started talking about my family", "I agree. He won't change. He never does. Thank you", "FYI, after my dad found the account we went private. And I went through my following list and got rid of people we don't know.

I'm planning to sit down with my mom and brother and explain my feelings, despite this we a tight nit family and they do adore my children so much. My mom only wants me to have a relationship with my dad as we have always had a conflicted one since I was able to form opinions. My brother hated conflict and is scared of my dad so he wants there to be no tension. I'm going to chat and if need be I will cut them from my life", "My father definitely. My brothers don't give information on my family as I asked them not to. I know them as people and I know they love my kids. But I will sit down with my mom and brothers and let them fully understand why I am upset. My mom was upset at what my dad said and my brothers were aswell, but they all want to keep the peace. Its very complicated but we are a close little family besides this.

They don't need my dad or his side", "His comment about their smell infuriated me. He categorised them as a type. They are a type of smell to him which is disgusting. My kids each have their own individual and unique smell just like other human beings. Because shocker....THEY ARE HUMANS", "I am going to sit down and chat with them. I didn't go into detail here but I know why they defended him but they all were mad over the racist comments, my brother had a go at my dad. They more \"defended\" him for my sake in a sense about my relationship with him.\n\nIts still wrong but I will have a talk, and if they understand and agree I have a right not to want anything to do with him then it will be fine. They won't be left with my kids alone for a while but it's ok. If they don't understand then they are gone", "Knowing my kids is a privilege for everyone besides me and my husband.

If I explain that fully with no interruptions they will understand", "I agree. NO WAY. It's disgusting he has said that about innocent children and also just categorising them as one, no they are individuals", "Calling them cute was so backhanded, while they are the cutest thing in the world to me, he clearly didn't mean it. It was more of a \"they are cute considering....\"", "I'm going to talk to them and make a final judgement \ud83d\udc97", "No offense taken. He deserve every bad thing that has happened to him", "He won't ever meet them", "I'm sorry \"mutts\" my beautiful children are not mutts. They are beautiful, strong, kind, intelligent and amazing.

They don't need him", "Definitely having a chat with them", "I came to reddit because my family made me question things but now I know full well that I made the right call", "Good on you for standing up for them! We have to protect our kids as much as possible", "With my family it goes much deeper then that. They are pissed about what he said about my kids because to my mom that's her grandbabies and my brothers nieces and nephews. They love them so much. They more said this for me if that makes sense. It's too much to get into on reddit but I'm definitely speaking to them about this", "His tiktok feed probably is about people like him with his mindset. But random stuff does come up occasionally. Thank you for this, I will definitely not be pressured into forgiving him as that's not the mother thing to do", "Oh my, I'm so sorry that's awful. I definitely will look out for my kids.

I will talk with my family but if it looks like they won't accept my kids too then they are gone", "I fully understand that last part. And it sucks that my kids and husband have to and I cant do as much as I wish I could to help them feel better. But I definitely have had many convos with my husband about this. He's a very understanding man, and I would of never ever spoken to my dad again if he was not ok with it.", "Time to wonder if you can look at mom and bros the same after they tried to downplay and justify it.

I'm so sorry your dad is so disgusting", "I got my son a child\u2019s book called \u201cMixed Me\u201d when he   was curious about his ethnicity. It helped him gain some perspective and self awareness/acceptance as well.", "It's a common occurrence, unfortunately, that black children struggle with their blackness in a society that idealizes whiteness. It manifests in any of those ways. Hating parts of yourself or of other people. Especially when something you do is considered \"white\", like myself. I've been called white because I'm very book smart, I speak in a soft tone, I like anime, I studied Japanese, etc. A friend of mine was always told her interests were white, the music she liked and shows she watched. It's unfortunately a rite of passage I guess, to hear stuff like that. I personally have always liked to daydream myself in my favorite shows, and up until I was 16 I never imagined myself as black. I still daydream like this, but I never imagine myself nonblack anymore. And after many years, I finally was okay with the idea of having and wanting shorter hair after my entire childhood and teens I wanted straight long pink hair (the pink part just because I love pink). What my point is, is that these thoughts are common and hopefully you just grow out of your subconscious self hating thoughts. I hope that all of your kids can have that peace in themselves and their identities.", "I wish you all the very best.\n\nI cannot imagine that is going to be an easy conversation.\n\nGood luck!", "\ud83d\udcaf", "You are doing an amazing job, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Me and my husband are the only one who have a right to always see them and control who does what with them. Everybody else earns their spot", "My video went kinda viral and it wouldn't shock me that it's only my luck he found it. I have gone private since that situation and deleted followers I don't know. But despite my family's actions, I know from being around them all the time that they wouldn't ever do that. They are very different people to what many think, I understand their reasons for saying what they said to me but I just don't accept it.", "Thank you and I'm sorry, every kids deserves this much protection. I knew from the start that I would be willing to let go of family members who don't accept my baby because of their skin tone", "He's gonna make fun of my babies smell, who smell like strawberries and baby bath and newborn smell (I'm savouring that smell so bad). I should definitely make fun of his smell that my younger self could never stand", "Thank you", "Lmao true, they smell like roses and he smells like shit. No wonder he doesn't like their smell, because they actually smell clean \ud83d\ude02. They have loads of love, they have so many family members who love them, especially a ton of family on their daddy's side \ud83d\ude2d", "I semi agree. They do agree his comments about their race was disgusting but they have their reasons for defending him which I'm aware of.

People like him definitely smell like sour milk even worse.", "I'm planning to talk to them", "He's dead to me. My kids don't deserve to have a racist grandpa", "It breaks my heart as a parent and my husbands too. We know we can't do anything to stop those people but all we can do is raise nice respectful humans who know how much they are valued by the right members of society", "I was thankful that I had two homes. At my moms I was always told that people are people despite race or sexuality. When I was younger I didn't understand my dad's comments and sadly just went along with everything but when I got old enough to realise everything, I completely changed my mindset and became the opposite of my father.", "The reasoning for the smell thing is so sad. I was educated on it but I just hate how it is carried over still into today's society", "Right like my husband is the most hygiene obsessed man ever. Like this man has all the soaps and stuff, it's crazy. My kids get it from their daddy, they are obsessed with using these special soaps and nice smelling shampoo.

But I draw the line at my kids being insulted", "Yes. My kids see a lot of biracial kids in school now and it's nice for them as they don't feel alone.

My beautiful family are everything to me. All of them make my day.", "That's so heartbreaking you grew up like that. You're beautiful inside and out alone from the kind comment you left.
