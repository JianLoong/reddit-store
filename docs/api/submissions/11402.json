We have 4 kids (7M, 4F, 2F and 1mo M).

While my mom was supportive about us as a couple, my dad had an issue. He's always been a racist and I always fought with him over it as I'm the opposite of all his opinions. \n\nNow when he found out I was pregnant, he was mad enough but he was even more mad when he saw the father. He started calling him slurs and it was really awful so for the 9 months I didn't see him but stupidly wanted to give him a chance to meet his grandson.\n\nObviously my kids are mixed race, but at the newborn stage they are just a bit lighter in general.\n\nMy dad saw the light skin tone on my son and started to convince himself and other people that I didn't sleep with an (slur) and that my son isn't one too. This really pissed me off that I stormed out and sent him a text explaining unless he fully changes his outlook on my family, he won't see me or my kid. I blocked him on social media except I kept his number. My parents are divorced so until we could afford our own life we lived with my mom.\n\nWell it's been 8 years since then and I've never been happier with my family. I have the most gorgeous kids and the most loving husband. We make silly tiktoks every once in a while and one of our videos went slightly viral, it was me and my son singing a song. \n\n2 days after that tiktok was posted I get a message from my dad. A long one explaining that he saw my tiktok of me and my son and really misses me. He found out about my other kids then too because I made my brothers promise that they don't give any information on me to my dad when they saw him. I'm very bitter about the past but I know people change so I went back and forth over text for a week and they yesterday I decided to call him to figure things out.\n\nWe spoke things out and it seemed to be going well until he told me \"I may not like their color or smell but I deserve to meet my grandkids. They are cute which is shocking for kids of a (slur)\". I lost it and hung up the phone call immediately. No way am I letting such an awful man around my children, when they already will have to grow up in a world that doesn't always accept them. They deserve a better childhood then I had. I sent my dad a long message saying how disgusting of a human he was for saying that about his own grandchildren, how he would never see me or my kids.\n\nMy brothers are telling me I am over reacting and saying \"Its dad, you get what you can with him.\" Even from my mom she tells me that my dad will never be perfect but he's trying and he does love you. I refused all this and now they are all saying I am ruining my children's chances of having another grandparent, as to them my dad's words are an improvement.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677877599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hey8n/aita_for_not_letting_my_racist_dad_meet_my_kids/", "score": 464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're doing the right thing cutting him off from your kids - they don't need to be subjected to that BS.", "NTA - Short answer: Your father doesn't deserve grandchildren if he won't accept your husband.\n\nElaboration: The world is a cruel, hateful place, even more so for people of color. Your father is especially cruel for saying those things to you about your husband - the man you chose to marry and the father of your children.

He\u2019s a racist. NTA keep your kids away from that bigot!", "NTA!!! Their smell? Crikey that is awful.

Big big hugs!!", "NTA\n\nI think your brothers saying \u201cyou get what you get\u201d is your sign that this is just who your dad is.

We live in a deeply racist society that is unforgiving to people of color. While you can't protect your family from every racist, you sure can protect them from this one. Also, if your siblings and your mom are glossing over the vile and disgusting things you father lives and breathes for the sake of familial duty, then they're siding with a loud and proud racist.

Your kids don't need to be exposed to that garbage.  \n\nAnd no, he's not trying despite what your mom says.  That's not trying - it's just regret over pushing you away.
