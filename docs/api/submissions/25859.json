My husband (33M) played sports casually as a kid, then did a few seasons of HS football, and nothing in college. We met shortly after graduating college, and while we never tested it at the time, I think we both just \"knew\" that I was likely stronger than him. \n\nWe got married and started working full-time and both fell off on our fitness goals. My husband naturally took on the traditional male role as \"heavy lifter\" around the house. After our two children however, I began to workout again to lose baby weight, and I haven't stopped. Fast forward several years and it's back to being \"known\" in our relationship that I am stronger than my husband. So much so, that he will often wait for me to get home to move something heavy around the house for him. It's even been a joke around our longterm friends that I can kick his butt (We all had an arm wrestling contest recently, and only 1 of the guys out of the 5 couples was able to beat me). \n\nNow though to the subject at hand...Last night my hubby and I each had a few glasses of wine. We were watching some random show on TV where the main female fought several men at once, and won. My 6 year old son and 8 year old daughter began to debate the topic which led to a family discussion about gender roles and all of that stuff. Which eventually led to our kids talking us (me) into wrestling my husband. My hubby was weirdly all-in right away, but I had reservations. So, my husband gave me a look which I took to mean \"come on babe, it's okay this is a learning opportunity, let's see what you got\". But apparently he was trying to communicate \"Just let me win and be the \"alpha\" in the family, to our kids even though I know you're stronger\"... If you've stuck with me this far, you probably see where it is going...\n\nMy husband and I rolled around on the floor, fighting for position for 30, maybe 45 seconds before I was able to pin him down. Luckily for him, the kids thought that as soon as I got him pinned for even a second, I won. So he didn't have to struggle there for long. Our daughter started cheering and laughing, our son looked like he had seen a ghost. \n\nFor some dumb reason, my hubby's first words were: \"I let you win, lets have a rematch so I can show the kids how strong daddy is\"...I'll admit I maybe should have picked up on this one, but my adrenaline was pumping and my daughter and I were having a like \"girlpower\" moment. So on round two I got my legs around him and began to squeeze. The squeal/scream and frantic tapping-out that came from him was so loud and dramatic that it made his loss look rough. This time our son cheered for me too and gave me a high five. \n\nThat night in bed, my husband freaked out and said \"You emasculated me in front of my own son, you are such a bitch! I hope you didn't just screw him up by watching his daddy get beat up by his mom\"...AITA  \n  ", "created_utc": 1693402354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165evee/aita_for_beating_my_husband_at_wrestling_in_front/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can start working out instead of trying to make you \"become\" the \"weaker\" one.", "NTA, if his masculinity is so fragile it relies on you pretending to be something you're not/ weaker than you are that's his issue.

Was the gender talk about how women can be strong and that they don't have to hide their strength for the sake of men's egos? Or was it about how women should be submissive to men? If the former, your actions need to match your words and the fight should have been fair.  If the latter, that message is bull and you proved it.\n\nThere's nothing wrong in showing that, while men are usually stronger at things like wrestling, that's not always true. It's ok to show that a man is still a man even if he isn't physically able to dominate a woman. It's ok to show that a woman doesn't have to pretend she's weak in order to maintain the patriarchy. It's ok to show that working out makes a person strong. It would not have been ok to throw the match in order to teach your kids a fake message.", "NTA and I\u2019m super proud of you too!

Like, I dated men in college who 100% were the alpha, and they were so masculine that it overpowered some of my alpha female energy lol.

I'm probably full of shit, but its a funny line.", "It was presented as men and women have strengths and weaknesses that occur naturally, however if you work hard even women can beat men at physical things, and men can beat women at things women are traditionally better at.

If I begin to squeeze you with my legs, its over and just a matter of time before you start tapping out lol.", "That was my perspective on it too. From the comments i've gotten, it appears to be very divided between wives/moms/daughters and husbands/dads/sons...I guess obviously. But I didn't realize by how much. \n\nUs women are looking at if from the relationship between a mother and daughter, where my job is to tell her she can be a bad ass and do anything a man can do and all that girl power stuff.\n\nThe dads are looking at it as a relationship between a dad and son where the dad is supposed to be big and strong and teach the son to be a \"man\". \n\nAnd according to a lot of the men, it will now be impossible for my husband to have that relationship with our son because now our son sees me (mommy) as the alpha in the family. \n\nI worked out a shitload and earned my strength. I can outlift (and apparently out wrestle) most average men and until yesterday my husband seemed okay, and even proud of that. There is something about the wrestling specifically that has this \"primal\" reaction out of the men when their wives can over power them lol.", "HAHAHA ngl that thought 100% has gone through my head since this happened. I wanted to be able to show my granddaughter one day  that her grandma was a bad ass lol", "lol right! I didn't even hold him down and rub it in. I just let him go as soon as he tapped out. Could have been worse lol. But he doesn't see it that way...", "I wasn't doing that part on purpose...at least that hard.\n\nBut we were wrestling, and he was grunting and clearly trying as hard as he could, but I managed to slip my legs around him and started squeezing my thighs together. And in like literally 5-8 seconds he started like frantically tapping out and let out this insane sound that was like borderline a squeal. I didn't realize the power in my own legs lol. I don't just go around squeezing things with them, so had no idea he would submit so fast.", "What do you mean?", "Yea so from what i've gathered from the comments, men look at this scenario through the lens of a dad and son relationship where the son is supposed to see the man as big and strong and superman. But when the son's mommy is stronger than dad and can beat him up, the son loses the underlying respect he had for his dad...or something like that. \n\nWhere as I look at is as a bad ass example for my daughter that if she works hard, she can even be stronger than a man, much less smarter and better work ethic and all that.", "Yea, i'm sure it would be. In my experience, men do not like it when their GF/wife is able to lift more than them, and overpower them lol. \n\nWether it's emasculating, or a turn on seems to be up to different guys. And my hubby used to not mind my superior strength, and even uses it to his advantage when he can't move something heavy outside.

The only thing hurt here is his ego, if he wants to be stronger than his wife, he knows what to do", "I\u2019m 5\u20190\u201d and my husband is 6\u20196\u201d when we used to wrestle I\u2019d take him down lol idk now but I do know stamina is no longer the same lol so he wins in that department.", "He brought up how he specifically wanted your son to think he was stronger than mommy. However, I\u2019d argue that the stronger lesson to teach here would be that just because your son is a male does not mean he will always be physically superior to women. If anything your husband should be happy about the lesson that was taught", "Even once is once too often, I don\u2019t care HOW mad he is.", "In honesty. It's worse that he's done this Infront of your kids. \nLike, not ok for your son to grow up thinking that you have to be strong to be a 'man'. Also aye, your little girl being delighted that girls can do the same as boys. \nIMO anyways.", "Or maybe it\u2019s because he felt the kids won\u2019t respect him now that they\u2019ve seen him lose to mommy. He might feel he\u2019s lost their admiration and they won\u2019t listen to anything he says or want to play/spend time with him. That they might think he\u2019s an embarrassment. Seeing as your son looked like he saw a ghost this was a pivotal moment for him and while you and daughter get your girl power moment your son saw his primary male role model get thrashed.", "To be honest i would mind if anyone could overpower me, I know that alot of people can ( a few older muscler brothers ). so I wouldn't mind it specific cause it was a women, but simple cause I wouldn't like to be overpowered.\n\nBut my ego would be more hurt if a skinny man could take me down than a muscler woman.", "No, we didn't wrestle :D She is on the spectrum, so she would never go full on me. But I know for 100% sure she would beat me hard if we would fight.\n\nMy perspective is that if you take all men and all women worldwide that (just made up numbers, but probably more accurate than a lot of people think) that around 20% of the strongest women beat 50-60% of the weakest men. Just look it as height. On average men are longer, but still not all men are longer than all women.\n\nAnd why would it matter? She is stronger. Big deal. The whole gender thing is  often bs in my opinion. It takes averages (or cultural stuff) and makes it rules. Just be happy who you are and with your strengths no matter what others can or are.", "[deleted]", "Especially when you can just rewrite their last phrase too:\n\n*\"you want to teach your son/husband power then teach them how to work hard & be the best they can be without comparing themselves to the rest of the world.\"*\n\nBut of course a statement like that wouldn't completely let the husband off the hook for his hissyfit and name-calling and we can't have that. When men win, they're winners, when women win it's ooh how come you didn't play nice?? Mental gymnastics need to be played to somehow put the onus on \"girl power\" being the enemy concept in this situation started by the husband.", "She shouldn\u2019t pretend anything. This whole thing was foolish. \n\nGuess what it\u2019s possible for both Mom & Dad to win because they play on the same team!  There was way too much ego in this & it\u2019s ridiculous. Wrestling around on the floor. JFC what exactly was the lesson here ... how to be the biggest asshole? I\u2019m stronger than Dad. So what?\n\nBut you\u2019re right everyone sucks here", "Did you read the same post I did?", "i aM a sTrOnG wOmAn!!!", "Also if he challenges you to a rematch please decline. This wrestling-with-your-spouse stuff seems like not a great idea at this point.", "Right! He literally asked me to do it. He just didn't realize somehow that I was going to be able to over power him like that lol. \"mom strength\"!", "I dislike that apparently daddy beating mommy is fine but the other way is damaging to their psyches.  That is not a good look imo, NTA", "Thats bad ass girl! I love it!\n\nWait so 2 things. First, did you use your legs to overpower him too? lol gotta love thunder thighs. \n\nSecond, so what was his reaction the first time you legitimately beat him and he was actually trying? Was he all shaken up also?", "So it is \"primal\". For him he feels like his son just watched him lose his manhood because mommy is stronger than him? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd my son was giving me a high five like 4 min later when he had to tapout to me...?", "Oh, interesting. Even if the woman is your own wife? From other replies i've gotten it seems like men would not mind generally if a woman could outlift them, or even overpower them and beat them at wrestling. But the idea of their own GFs or wives doing that is where it begins to get emasculating for them. huh.", "So you just \"suspect\" that your wife is stronger than you? Or you two have tested it somehow in like the gym? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that was kind of confusing...I think I know what you mean. For example, when I was in my prime in college, our weight coach would give us our stats compared to national averages. By my senior year, my upper body was stronger than 68% of US adult men,  and my lower body was stronger than 91% of US adult men. These days i'm not that strong, but I wouldn't be surprised if I was still significantly over 50% of men.", "WTF? \n\nBro, I can squat 300+ lbs and do bicep curls with 25s, if you think trying to tickle me is going to prevent yourself from getting your ass kicked, you're mistaken. I played a D1 sport in college for 4 years, i'm not some sorority girl that giggles when you tickle her lol. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't even know what to do with the rest of that...", "This is just gross. Do better", "No .... when women compete against their partners they are just stupid. What\u2019s the prize here?\n\nBoth my husband & I played D1 level sports. We love to compete. He is a professional coach. He loves to win. We have also been married for 32 years, raised 4 kids & we don\u2019t compete against each other. Because we\u2019re on the same team!!", "Maybe I misinterpreted? Seemed liked the kids egged them into wrestling.", "Oh he already has, he wants to try again tonight. But after the kids go to bed this time. He claims he's going to be able to win and will actually try this time...", "Look, embarrassing your partner in front your kids is not a good thing to do even as a joke. \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter who laughed, who enjoyed it. You should taken the hint and let him win the next round. Then beat him in the third, then let him win again in the fourth and maybe had a few draws and so on. That\u2019s how you could shown the kids that men and woman are equal or whatever it was you were trying to convey to them. \n\nHis reaction was terrible and he shouldn\u2019t have lashed out calling you a b*tch. \n\nBut\u2026. Reading your replies I\u2019m beginning to wonder if you enjoy embarrassing him by proving you\u2019re stronger than him.", "Too be honest I never dated a girl that is muscular, so could technically be a turn on as well.\n\nBut if I know myself I would hate it if anyone could wrestle me into submission even if there was 2 against 1.", "When it is about things that requires strength, she will do it more easy then when i try to do it myself. I really do not need to test it, it is just a fact. It is not by a small margin. She is really stronger a lot.\n\nAnd yeah, that is what i mean. (Sorry English isn't my native language, and i am also not the best in explaining stuff.) We are often only looking to averages and not at the top of normal distribution at things like these. And then we put those averages in 'rules' what a man should be. Don't buy it.", "[deleted]", "There's nothing wrong with friendly competition. The only one who made this unfriendly was the husband who a) started the competition, b) went for round two, and c) threw a fit and resorted to calling names when he didn't win. If a couple chooses to not engage in competition that's their preference, but many couples do enjoy friendly competition. The ones who make it unfriendly and become sore losers are the assholes and shouldn't engage.", "It would seem the husband in this scenario pushed to not have teamwork but to be pitted against each other. Shame on that husband for pushing that.", "We were talking about how some women work really hard and can even be as strong as men, when my daughter brought up my muscles... My legs have always had some serious muscle mass. And she asked who could win between my husband and I which led to some more joking around before I finally agreed to do it. My husband and kids were all trying to talk me into it. The only thing I didn't do right apparently, was just let my husband beat me to save is male ego.", "This was all about ego. I\u2019m better than you. Personally, I don\u2019t want to be better than my husband. We are equals & we are on the same team. The team is only as good as it\u2019s weakest player. Parents don\u2019t make each other look weak in their kids eyes. That\u2019s not cool.", "No your comment is gross and weird", "\u201cFriendly\u201d .... when was the last time you wrestled with anyone? It\u2019s not about being friendly. This wasn\u2019t a game of Monopoly. \n\nMaybe next time they could just arm wrestle or go lift some weights or to pick up a refrigerator.", "Just out of curiosity .... what will your reaction be when your son or daughter start wrestling with each other & someone actually gets hurt?", "Yeah I agree. But she didn\u2019t make him look weak, they were just playing. Would an arm wrestle have been any different? Are a husband and wife never allowed to compete? I get your sentiment but I think you\u2019re making a bigger deal out of this than it is, and that\u2019s the whole point. Him losing the wrestle should not have been embarrassing or emasculating at all, but he sees it that way.", "JFC it's not like they were wrestling with knives and guns. And having a friendly competition just means don't act like an asshole and have bad sportsmanship. It doesn't mean don't try to compete to win.", "Well my son already wrestles around with his friends sometimes...he's a boy. It's sort of what they do... (maybe why men don't like when a woman beats them at it). And if it begins to get out of control, we can talk to him about it, or even better - get him into wrestling so he learns to control it. \n\nAnd as for my daughter, if she shows any signs of being interested in wrestling/fighting I would gladly get her into BJJ or organized wrestling. Having a teenage daughter who can beat up all the boys at her school would be a dream as a parent. \n\nBut, she's a girl and has never shown any overt aggression before. So, i'm not too concerned.", "The same reaction when they get hurt doing litteraly any of the other infinite potentially dangerous things on this earth."]}
