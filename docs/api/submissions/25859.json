My husband (33M) played sports casually as a kid, then did a few seasons of HS football, and nothing in college. We met shortly after graduating college, and while we never tested it at the time, I think we both just \"knew\" that I was likely stronger than him. \n\nWe got married and started working full-time and both fell off on our fitness goals. My husband naturally took on the traditional male role as \"heavy lifter\" around the house. After our two children however, I began to workout again to lose baby weight, and I haven't stopped. Fast forward several years and it's back to being \"known\" in our relationship that I am stronger than my husband. So much so, that he will often wait for me to get home to move something heavy around the house for him. It's even been a joke around our longterm friends that I can kick his butt (We all had an arm wrestling contest recently, and only 1 of the guys out of the 5 couples was able to beat me). \n\nNow though to the subject at hand...Last night my hubby and I each had a few glasses of wine. We were watching some random show on TV where the main female fought several men at once, and won. My 6 year old son and 8 year old daughter began to debate the topic which led to a family discussion about gender roles and all of that stuff. Which eventually led to our kids talking us (me) into wrestling my husband. My hubby was weirdly all-in right away, but I had reservations. So, my husband gave me a look which I took to mean \"come on babe, it's okay this is a learning opportunity, let's see what you got\". But apparently he was trying to communicate \"Just let me win and be the \"alpha\" in the family, to our kids even though I know you're stronger\"... If you've stuck with me this far, you probably see where it is going...\n\nMy husband and I rolled around on the floor, fighting for position for 30, maybe 45 seconds before I was able to pin him down. Luckily for him, the kids thought that as soon as I got him pinned for even a second, I won. So he didn't have to struggle there for long. Our daughter started cheering and laughing, our son looked like he had seen a ghost. \n\nFor some dumb reason, my hubby's first words were: \"I let you win, lets have a rematch so I can show the kids how strong daddy is\"...I'll admit I maybe should have picked up on this one, but my adrenaline was pumping and my daughter and I were having a like \"girlpower\" moment. So on round two I got my legs around him and began to squeeze. The squeal/scream and frantic tapping-out that came from him was so loud and dramatic that it made his loss look rough. This time our son cheered for me too and gave me a high five. \n\nThat night in bed, my husband freaked out and said \"You emasculated me in front of my own son, you are such a bitch! I hope you didn't just screw him up by watching his daddy get beat up by his mom\"...AITA  \n  ", "created_utc": 1693402354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165evee/aita_for_beating_my_husband_at_wrestling_in_front/", "score": 2537, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was the gender talk about how women can be strong and that they don't have to hide their strength for the sake of men's egos? Or was it about how women should be submissive to men? If the former, your actions need to match your words and the fight should have been fair.  If the latter, that message is bull and you proved it.\n\nThere's nothing wrong in showing that, while men are usually stronger at things like wrestling, that's not always true. It's ok to show that a man is still a man even if he isn't physically able to dominate a woman. It's ok to show that a woman doesn't have to pretend she's weak in order to maintain the patriarchy.

If I begin to squeeze you with my legs, its over and just a matter of time before you start tapping out lol.", "That was my perspective on it too. From the comments i've gotten, it appears to be very divided between wives/moms/daughters and husbands/dads/sons...I guess obviously. But I didn't realize by how much. \n\nUs women are looking at if from the relationship between a mother and daughter, where my job is to tell her she can be a bad ass and do anything a man can do and all that girl power stuff.\n\nThe dads are looking at it as a relationship between a dad and son where the dad is supposed to be big and strong and teach the son to be a \"man\". \n\nAnd according to a lot of the men, it will now be impossible for my husband to have that relationship with our son because now our son sees me (mommy) as the alpha in the family. \n\nI worked out a shitload and earned my strength. I can outlift (and apparently out wrestle) most average men and until yesterday my husband seemed okay, and even proud of that. There is something about the wrestling specifically that has this \"primal\" reaction out of the men when their wives can over power them lol.", "HAHAHA ngl that thought 100% has gone through my head since this happened.

Could have been worse lol. But he doesn't see it that way...", "I wasn't doing that part on purpose...at least that hard.\n\nBut we were wrestling, and he was grunting and clearly trying as hard as he could, but I managed to slip my legs around him and started squeezing my thighs together. And in like literally 5-8 seconds he started like frantically tapping out and let out this insane sound that was like borderline a squeal. I didn't realize the power in my own legs lol. I don't just go around squeezing things with them, so had no idea he would submit so fast.", "What do you mean?", "Yea so from what i've gathered from the comments, men look at this scenario through the lens of a dad and son relationship where the son is supposed to see the man as big and strong and superman. But when the son's mommy is stronger than dad and can beat him up, the son loses the underlying respect he had for his dad...or something like that. \n\nWhere as I look at is as a bad ass example for my daughter that if she works hard, she can even be stronger than a man, much less smarter and better work ethic and all that.", "Yea, i'm sure it would be. In my experience, men do not like it when their GF/wife is able to lift more than them, and overpower them lol. \n\nWether it's emasculating, or a turn on seems to be up to different guys.

Well rounded children need role models, all kinds of them.

Who has even taught them to be surprised that a man can lose to woman at anything this early? That's what surprised me early on, the fact that the kids were the ones having a gender debate in the first place. At there ages it's literally before the testosterone kicks in, and there is no significant strength difference across gender lines. Probably half the girls in each of their classes can beat half the boys in wrestling. I mean. I wonder who's been teaching them this.

Because if you don't you're going to lose no matter what's in your pants.\n\nHopefully he won't pass on his weakness to his son. And by that I don't mean his inability to beat up at wrestling. I mean his inability to **cope** with the fact of his kids knowing he can't beat OP at wrestling, even though he already knew that anyway, and we all **thought** he was better than needing to care about that when it came to him needing to move heavy shit.\n\nAnd for what it's worth none of this even coming from a hardcore feminist. I am a dude, on the weaker side myself. And while I agree with the principals of feminism, I have seen it pushing too far in certain areas. Here's a probably \"misogynist\" comment I made for evidence:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/work/s/HYywrouamL\n\nIn response to a comment where someone was claiming all women love getting old enough not be noticed by men sexually anymore because all women hate any and all male attention and no woman would ever want any man to be attracted to them, I shared this experience I had:\n\n\"I became good friends with a fairly militant feminist who once confided in me that it made her (f26) sad that men didn't stare at her like they did when she was in her mid-late teens. She was very aware of what this said about men, and outside this conversation she hated being stared at as much as any other woman.\n\nIt turns out, no amount, or intensity, or alignment of politics is actually immune to the amount of fucks people do give about fucking, and about being desirable (and therefore, being more likely to be more able to fuck when one finds someone they actually want to, as opposed to almost certainly not being able to).\"", "Buy him flowers tomorrow and apologize.", "NTA.

I'm a fan of that sport, and most look like natural, agile wrestlers w/ excellent core strength. I wouldn't have issued that challenge.", "Oh yes! Once with a younger guy, maybe mid 20s, white belt (he was only there maybe 2 weeks and had a bigger ego then anyone else) told an almost black belt woman to \"not feel bad if she can't throw him since he's bigger the her\"\n\nGranted he probably outweighed her a bit, he wasn't fat but definitely wider then her but only had maybe 3 inches height wise on her so it wasn't a drastic size difference.\n\nHe hit the ground with such a load thud, didn't say anything else to her the rest of the class. \n\nI'm not sure what was more embarrassing, that he was so easily thrown or that his partner also had the grace to throw him so he didn't hit his head or anything on the mat.", "And this is all completely believable because the first thing serious lifters do is...brag about how much they can leg press?", "Probably a reason people shouldn't wrestle after some drinks, easier to get carried away tho that's on both of you and not really the main point, just an aside that I'm guessing that's the reason", "At first I was totally saying NTA but seeing how many responses you've made and how much your reveling in this has kind of changed my stance. \n\nNow I feel bad for the guy.", "Right girl!\n\nHow much can you press?", "I kept saying no,  but he and the kids were pushing it.

We'd never wrestled, but he knew I was generally stronger than him. So, I kept saying no, but once we squared off, mommy had to teach daddy a lesson lol. \n\nAnd oh for sure, my teamates and I all had giant legs/lower halfs and yet most of us still had pretty legit 6-pack abs too lol. All we did was workout all day.", "So, in that scenario and most other i'm sure you see, a higher belt is beating a lower belt.

He will never walk right and will never chase a woman again. \n\nThe second is her thighs, strongest place on a woman, you grip your thighs around his stomach and keep on until you hear a pop.... you're safe to do whatever.

I am also a head coach for a large youth wrestling program. I have absolutely no doubt that my wife wouldn\u2019t stand a chance...most guys wouldn\u2019t.  But I would never put her through that. I also won\u2019t wrestle guys without a wrestling or other combat sport background for fun for exactly the same reason that anyone with a similar background like this knows\u2026 physically dominating someone is humiliating and traumatic for someone who has never been trained or competed in a combat sport and people react badly. \n\nYou\u2019re minimizing it, but let\u2019s put you in the same situation\u2026 if it was you and me rolling around, you\u2019d get wrecked and quickly put in a painful position or one that is impossible to breathe and you\u2019ll panic just like your husband did. Trust me, if you\u2019ve never trained extensively or competed, you\u2019re going to react emotionally and it is universally bad. This is why SA survivors have PTSD so bad\u2026 feeling physically helpless or dominated is extremely traumatic.  It also doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s just for fun\u2026 that\u2019s not the way your brain works. You\u2019re going to react in one of two ways\u2026 you\u2019re going to get emotionally upset and quit or you\u2019re going to get angry, try harder and then get injured.

Combat sports and competing in games are not the same thing", "Wrestling jokingly and wrestling seriously are two completely separate things. And from your comments in this thread you seem to take this competition stuff with your husband way too seriously. \"I beat him at this, I beat him at that.\" It's like you take some kind of pride in constantly reminding him that you're stronger than him. \n\nI'm better than my wife at a lot of stuff and she's better than me at equally as much. What is the point of me trying to lord it over her that I squat/bench/whatever more than her? What would be the point in her cajoling me about being able to beat me in a distance race? Who cares?

It didn't happen. \n\nUnless your husband has an illness or disability, or you're a high level strength sports athlete and/or wrestler, there's no way this is happening. \n\nAs someone who has done strength sports and grappling for years, I've seen the difference between men and women when it comes to strength. A guy can walk into a powerlifting gym, and with 3 months of regular training, they'll be stronger than women who have been training for *years.* I had a female strength coach at one point, she was a competitive powerlifter. I was one of the weakest males among the regulars, and could still lift more than her. Hell, I'm still not very good, but I can bench more than a world champion female powerlifter (though she would destroy me on squats and deadlifts). \n\nI've also grappled with more experienced and skilled women than me. I had to learn not just to use my strength to overpower them as it made training no fun for either party. And this was when I was just starting to do strength training, so I was not fit or strong. \n\nThe idea of you overpowering your husband because you've been going to the gym for a few years is laughable. Anyone with a little bit of experience in martial arts or strength sports could tell you that. \n\nIf you're talking about beating him via *skill*  though, that's a different matter. If you've trained a grappling sport such as BJJ or wrestling, I could believe that you'd beaten him. Not through a show of strength, but because you were more skilled at grappling. I once trained with a high level competitive black belt in BJJ who was a woman, and although I was stronger than her, she was so much more skilful that it was irrelevant. \n\nThat doesn't make the comment that \"he will often wait for me to get home to move something heavy around the house for him\" any less laughable. If this is actually true, he's trying to make you feel better. You're not actually stronger than him. Or else he needs to go see a doctor.", "Seriously, read some of OP's comments.
