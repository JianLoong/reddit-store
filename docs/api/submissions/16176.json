I think a fair way to split things is to ask him to split ALL utilities plus the HOA since this covers some of the utilities, at the very least. What I would do if I were you, is actually have him pay the majority of these things on a monthly basis, and divert the money you were paying towards these things towards the property taxes and maintenance of the house.

I think the idea of equity is lost on a lot of Redditors. You own an asset, and are going to benefit from the maintenance and care of this asset.
