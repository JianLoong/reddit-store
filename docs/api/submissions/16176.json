I think a fair way to split things is to ask him to split ALL utilities plus the HOA since this covers some of the utilities, at the very least. What I would do if I were you, is actually have him pay the majority of these things on a monthly basis, and divert the money you were paying towards these things towards the property taxes and maintenance of the house.

NTA", "you are correct. I assumed no prenup...", "If the house is held in trust, there wouldn't need to be a prenup to protect the asset. The trust in it's own right owns the house, she just happens to be the beneficiary of the trust.", "He can contribute to utilities and household expenses without paying for taxes and structural upgrades to a home that isn't his. Like I said, if he wasn't her spouse he would definitely owe her rent. I wouldn't be against him making a nominal monthly contribution towards expenses, but he shouldn't be expected to pay half on a new roof or a bathroom upgrade. He certainly shouldn't be paying more of his income towards such things than she is. She inherited a home and the equity that it will continue to build and has a trust fund to cover the costs associated with homeownership.", "My judgment is NTA. I think home owners expenses fall into the same category as other shared living expenses. If he was renting he\u2019d have to pay monthly expenses to live somewhere without gaining any actual equity in the property. \n\nMight be worth consulting with an estate attorney or real estate attorney to work out something fair to both you.", "Wanting your spouse to share the benefits of maintaining the house you share together isn't expecting much either.", "Is there no difference between bills and taxes?", "Did you skip over the fact that so is she?", "I think you are thinking about things in a really responsible way, and thinking of what will happen in the event of the worst case scenario. You seem more responsible than a lot of other people. \n\nSplitting everything evenly is usually fine if you stay married. But things CAN get messy if you ever split. You're not wrong or weird for thinking of this OP!", "Agreed. He would be paying SOMETHING if he was living anywhere else. While he doesn't own the house, he certainly benefits from living in it.  Also, well it's nice that he's helping his mom and his dad financially, that doesn't exclude him from being financially responsible for his own living arrangements.  Not expenses such as home repair, as those only benefit a home owner. But certainly household expenses such as utilities, HOA.. Still much cheaper than paying rent.", "Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but I don't think OP is paying any share of the cost either, is she?", "Why would he want to do that? If he can afford to own a home he's not going to want to be a tenant and lose out on building equity.\n\nWhat is OP's goal here? To have her husband move out and buy his own home?", "> Or he could live somewhere else\n\nThey should buy two houses? Very logical lol.\n\n> Why should OP have to sell the house when her husband won\u2019t contribute to it?\n\nBecause he wants to be a homeowner with OP.\n\nWhy does OP get to decide that her husband cannot be a homeowner? This is a bizarre marital dynamic and throws up red flags regarding controlling behaviour on OP's part.", "I also wonder if her does begin to pay property taxes and maintenance if he would be able to go after a cut in the event of a divorce? Not sure how inheritance assets work if there\u2019s outside help maintaining or building the asset. But I do think if he does start to pay in, a contract should be drawn up that he gets what he put in plus a percentage of whatever the value increase if any starting from the time he started helping. Not sure if that\u2019s even possible. But I agree it\u2019s not fair to have him pay in to an asset he won\u2019t benefit from if they divorce. He should be paying more of the utilities if not all if she will be paying for the property.", "Not talking about the house. That was in reference to his wealth. All they're finances are so separated its very possible there's a prenup in place.", "Did you fully read the post? She isn't asking for money toward renovations but asking for money to keep basic bills paid. No where is it stated she's asking for more money than she's paying.", "If it's a family inheritance, it's not unusual to keep it in only one partners name in case of divorce. She isn't asking for money to redo or add value to the home. She is only asking for property tax and HOA free money, both of which he'd have to pay elsewhere. \n\nPaying property tax and HOA fees are not maintaining or increasing the value of the home. it's only keeping the house paid for on the most basic levels. \n\nBy your logic, if he went and rented a home, he shouldn't have to pay those bills either since he's not benefitting from the cost of the home.", "Where does it say she isn\u2019t paying for the bills to the house?", "Also, HOA fees do nothing to add equity to the home, it's just the price you pay to live in the community and possibly benefit from services it provides. If the house is sold, the new owner pays the HOA as well, so it's a living expense that doesn't add equity/wealth to the trust.", "Kind of a big leap to assume he's not paying utilities, isn't it?", "Where did I say they should buy two houses? He already pays his dad's rent, he could live there\n\n>he wants to be a homeowner with OP.\n\nSo he wants to have everything a homeowner has besides paying towarda the bills? Yeah, that won\u2019t work with OP's house", "Where do you get that she wants for money to keep basic bills paid? She's saying 'home expenses'. Those are understood to be taxes, HOA fees, improvements and repairs, and so on. Otherwise, she would say 'utilities'.", "Not bills, taxes and hoa fees, right?", "If you are renting a home, you are told upfront what your part of the costs will be when you move in, not have it sprung on your years later.", "In some states by paying taxes and HOA fees he would in case of a divorce have some entitlement to the property or at least a pay out. If she writes up a little rent agreement this can be avoided.", "It reads to me like the trust pays for the taxes and HOA fees, if that's what you mean by bills.", "Isn't the whole point of an HOA to maintain and increase property values?", "It sounds like he's unhappy in general with the fact that OP has decided all on her own what their marital house is going to be and that he's not going to own any of it.\n\nAnd he has a right to be. If the genders were reversed the replies would be very different.\n\n> He is usually very generous so I wonder if I'm just being punitive\n\nOP needs to talk to her husband. Not about bills but about the living situation in general.", "She never said renovation but specifically stated about property tax and hoa fees. Those are basic expenses to owning the home and keeping it. If you don't generalize that as bills, that's fine.", "Those are basic expenses with a house. To keep the house, you have to pay the property tax. Pretty basic expense", "So rent and property tax never go up when you're renting? Lucky you.", "Yes. But the home already has the benefits of being in the HOA due to its location (assuming that it's not optional). Who pays the fees doesn't add or subtract that benefit to the value of the property. The next owner would also have to pay those fees on top of purchasing the home for a higher cost due to the neighborhood and HOA. Just like taxes, it's a cost of living in that specific home.", "It's OP's right because SHE inherited the house, he didn\u2019t. It's either he helps with some house payment or he gets treated like a tenant at this point", "Sure, but still, different than bills, right? Or no?", "> It's OP's right because SHE inherited the house, he didn\u2019t\n\nOk. Sell the house. Wife gets all the money from the sale. Then buy a house together. Or have the husband buy in to this house.\n\nIf the husband wants to be a homeowner, the wife cannot just ignore that. That's not fair and it's a very shaky foundation to build a marriage on top off.", "> It's either he helps with some house payment or he gets treated like a tenant at this point\n\nThis is 6 of one, half a dozen of the other. What does getting treated like a tenant look like, if it's not him making house payments without building equity?", "Bill is a general term for money you owe towards a good or service. Car notes, mortgages, hoa fees, utilities, and the taxes that come with them are all bills.", "Why should she have to sell HER house in order to get her husband to help with bills?", "She doesn't. She can have the husband buy in.\n\nHe's clearly unhappy with the living situation and your suggestion is what? Ignore him and plow ahead?"]}
