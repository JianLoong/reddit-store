The kid/s get up in the morning and have breakfast, and then it's off to daycare. They get home and it's dinner, bath, bed. They have A LOT less time to mess up the house.\n\nFactoring in the extra cost of craft supplies, toys, food, activities, and transport, how much does being a SAHM actually cost? And then you add up all the extra housework and all the extra time... Daycare is looking a lot more affordable", "The difference came out of her hubands salary????  No.  The kids are 50% his so both of them paid for the childcare.", "At the end of the day, what may seem like the most practical solution on paper isn't always the best course of action. Unless a family's situation is *dire*, strong-arming one partner into living a life that they don't want does not produce a good outcome. Finding a suitable *compromise* does. \n\nEven if OP does not care about the emotional impact this would have on her, people do not operate well this way and it will impact the quality of everything from the relationship to the children's overall happiness & development to her actual productivity. Things will not operate smoothly. \n\nIf he does care about her wellbeing, he needs to understand that expecting her to quit her job also means expecting her to sacrifice her passion, personal income, financial freedom, and overall mental health, things that make her who she is. We only have one life to live, so that isn't just a big ask, it's a *monumental* one. She will live a less fulfilled life, and we should not want that for our partners.", "Four kids by age 30. Fucking quiverfull shit.", "I\u2019m a dentist, and I would say the above comment is correct. I imagine it\u2019s because most dentists and physicians tend to be high earning, so the majority of them would be classified as upper middle class (or upper class depending on whose definition you are using) and this demographic I imagine would lean conservative fiscally. Traditionally, dentistry and medicine has also been an old white guys club so yeah\u2026\n\nFWIW, my wife and I are pretty liberal. We have two kids and I never would ask her to give up her career to be a SAHP unless that\u2019s what she wanted. We hired a nanny which costs even more than daycare but hey, it\u2019s the price we pay to accommodate the lifestyle we want. \n\nOP, YTA. I\u2019m the same age as you. It doesn\u2019t matter how much or little your wife earns. Either pay for daycare, or hire a nanny.", "My knee jerk was to say that it\u2019s a trade that\u2019s likely passed down through generations, but that also applies to doctors, so I\u2019m super curious as well.", "Especially as a hair and nail tech. What\u2019s she supposed to do, be doing someone\u2019s nails in her home while there\u2019s a baby crawling around? She\u2019s right that she wouldn\u2019t get many clients that way. Also sounds dangerous for the kids.", "My mom stayed home until my younger brother went to school (for context, she had 4 kids between June of 1981 and June of 1986). She was glad to go to work. She said when we were home, we drove her nuts, and when we were I school, she was bored and hated soap operas.", "Same! In fact, I get really offended when people insist that working moms do some kind of disservice to their kids. I don't think she feels this way anymore, but a friend of mine said to me once that she thought kids were ALWAYS better with a stay at home parent (not necessarily the mom, but if the family can make do with one income, they should). When my mom was a SAHM, she was miserable, it showed, a lot. And when she went back to work it meant I had to pick up a lot of slack around the house (it's not like my dad was much help) and with my sister, but she was clearly happier and more able to deal with us and spend time with us when she was home. Kids need happy parents who feel fulfilled and not resentful. And adults need partners who aren't constantly hounding them to change their minds.", "My mum got laid off when I was 12 and my brother 14 and now obviously this is a different situation because we were older and she had been laid off but I quickly realized my dream of a SAHM was wrong. I always saw all those mum\u2019s on tv spending so much time with their kids and the kids would come home to snacks and their friends could stop by. My mum didn\u2019t need to work so her being laid off financially was fine, but oh my gosh she was so miserable and bored. I was like nope nope nope I was wrong - I do not want a SAHM. I\u2019d rather spend less time with a happy mum than more time with a sad one.", "Very good point  plus she is working so that income would be gone  even if he makes MORE than enough money himself", "Does he still think this way? It\u2019s amazing how many assume women just want to stay at home and be surrounded by kids and have no outside interests/intellectual stimulation. \n\nBut no one says that to fathers.", "My coworker (not a parent) thinks being a SAHP must be great: you get to sleep in and watch shows all day!", "Hell, my wife works and I\u2019m the one that stays home. She makes way more then I did, and she would go crazy being stuck home. I on the other hand, love it. I take classes and watch my son grow up. It\u2019s amazing.", "I only babysat 2-4 hours a day, and everyday I was EXHAUSTED. I cant imagine doing that 24/7 WITHOUT getting paid too\u2026 Caring for kids is the hardest full time job in my opinion.", "This \ud83d\udcaf", "Keep popping those babies out though!", "He's not even making the right argument if he's being stingy though.  He's saying that they don't have to spend the money because he makes enough to provide for the family, but the actual money argument is that she makes less than the daycare would cost, otherwise they still come out ahead financially.", "I definitely never thought about it. I was laid off while on maternity leave and just kind of slid into staying home. You think it is for a short time but going back to work before the school years start for ALL your kids is a big lift so it's easy for it to stretch out into many years. I had to start my career over, and in the middle of my husband's biggest responsibility/earnings upswing. I went back part time because his earnings potential was on the line so he couldn't easily step up more when we were used to me handling all the home stuff. So all in all a huge hit to my lifetime $$$. Many valuable parenting experiences in there and the kids are now amazing adults but it was a lot of sacrifice that I didn't understand I would be making when I took that first step.", "My mom was a hairdresser when I was a kid, and I\u2019d either sit and play with the Lego table at the salon with the owner\u2019s kid who was also my age, or my grandma would watch me. \n\nWhen I was 4 and my brother was born, she did the hairdressing in our basement, before getting another out of house job when my brother was around 3 and it was only then we went to day homes.", "Lunch programs where I live are all optional and the parents have to pay for it.

She went back to work when my younger brother was old enough to stay home and was being begged by her work to keep going upward into management because she was what they wanted in a good manager, but she didn't want to.\n\nMy dad retired and became a SAHH while she isn't ready to retire.", "Other than that one period she was out (which was also when she was pregnant/having a kid), I've never had a SAH parent and don't feel any particular loss. Both of my parents went back to school in my childhood (while also working, in my mom's case) and I think that was an excellent way to grow up. We got really good role models in the rigors of life and academia with the low price of having to do out own laundry.\n\nIt is nice if one parent has a flexible enough schedule to pick kids up if they're sick, but it was really good for my development to go to daycare and see my parents working hard.", "\u201cIt must have been difficult to be a widow with young children\u201d \ud83d\udc80 \n\nYou beauty!

I'm not parent but I can't understand why some men think it's so easy to stay home and watch small children and babies all day.

I swear, these same men who want their wives to give up their careers then moan if they have to pay alimony if they get divorced.", "This is still short-sighted. What if her mother retires? Sells the salon? What if they get divorced? How much is OP going to whine about alimony?
