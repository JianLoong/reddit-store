Was cooking morning eggs for myself at 6. Helping my mom with chores and I am MUCH more resilient as an adult comparing to other women I see.  I can do Anything thanks to my upbringing. I mean, I don't know how old the kids are but 6 years old kid won't die from being alone for 4 hours if the kid has shown to be somewhat responsible. common people.
