Aside from the not asking how will that work with your current custody agreement? I am guessing you would t be able to move your kids half way across the country without your ex husbands concurrence.", "Making unilateral decisions is an AH move. NTA for saying you need to think about it and your kid.", "NTA\n\nAs a person that had to move during highschool, and had some big issues with the new one... nope! Not the AH. If he wants to move he can go. You had a reasonable boundary of after the 16 year old graduates (though I still feel bad for the younger ones as the 12 year old is going to be hurt by moving around 14-15). He has no reason to move other than HIS convenience. This doesn't bode well for the family long term.", "NTA good on you for having your children's best interests at heart.", "NTA. \n\nWhy does his sister know more of his plans than his spouse. Y\u2019all have some issues to address as a couple. The moving isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s a symptom.", "NTA - this should be a conversation with you, not something be decides on his own", "NTA, I don't understand why he thought that would work. Oklahoma is very different to New York, he didn't consult you. Why is he all set on moving all of a sudden when he's lived there for over 15 years?", "NTA - Your husband needs a bit of a reality check. First and foremost, the kids are more important. They have a right to be near their father (would moving that far away be a custody/visitation issue?) and to finish out school with all their friends. And why would you want to move to Oklahoma near his family when they've made no effort to visit you and you would have no other connections there? He seems to have made this decision without consulting you at all and that's not fair to you or your kids. I fully agree with what you told him, if he wants to go that badly, he can go himself without him dragging you or your kids down with him.", "NTA. \n\nI think the crucial part of all this is communication. It is so important that he talks to you about it, but it sounds like he hasn't even tried. Maybe that's because he already knows what your response will be? \n\nYou haven't completely ruled it out, just said that you do not feel like right now is the correct time, and that you would be happy to have a conversation about it in the near future. Which is fair on your part, in my opinion. \n\nHe has every right to want to explore options for moving, especially if his family are entirely elsewhere but he has to remember that he has a family in you and your children too that he has to talk to, consider and communicate with.", "NTA.  Your husband doesn't get to unilaterally decide to move you and your family across country.", "NTA what's his urgency? Does he understand how much goes into moving, let alone interstate and WITH KIDS. I'd suggest you all sit down as a family and discuss it with the kids. On the off chance that the kids are all keen to move, sure go for it. Otherwise, looks like hubby's moving to Oklahoma on his own.", "NTA.\n\nDear god, please do not give up New York for *Oklahoma*.", "NTA. Also, if you have a visitation agreement with your ex then you probably can't move without going to court. Has your cureent husband even considered you and the family he joined at all?", "NTA. He's deciding this for you without any of your input. \n\nHe can pound sand.", "NTA\n\nIf the father of your minor children goes to court, he could prevent the children from moving with you and force you into being the long distance parent in a long distance custody arrangement.", "NTA. It's absolutely not fair to take your children away from their father. I do understand that sometimes sacrifices need to be made, but this is a huge thing and he absolutely should be discussing a huge thing like this with you before deciding for the both of you. Not his sister or anyone else.", "NTA\n\nSomething smells fishey here, why is he pushing for a move so quickly all of a sudden when you had a time-line on having the discussion not moving.\nPeople don't typically make a move like that unless they are running towards or from something.\nMight not hurt to do some digging...", "NTA, but you may want to investigate why he's suddenly hell bent on moving and doing things behind your back.  Either he's hiding something or he's just an asshole.\n\nYou need to discuss this with him instead of just giving him 'looks'.  And be honest...are you really willing to consider moving to OK when your middle son graduates?  What if your ex files to keep the youngest two in NY?", "NTA. It sounds like you aren't going to be interested in moving to Oklahoma when your son graduates either. Your husband needs to respect your decision - it takes agreement to move across town, let alone across the country. This isn't some 40s America where society found it ok to allow the husband to dictate decisions like this. I'd reiterate that you will not entertain moving until the time you agreed on, and you are not promising you will do so at that time either.", "NTA\n\nHe can move by himself and hell, I'd even hire a moving company to do the heavy lifting for him.", "NTA. You have a blended family, and making a move across state lines when minor children are involved is not something one unilaterally decides. Not to mention, your ex could fight it.\n\nWould you move without your kids?", "NTA He just threw this at you? You have more to consider than just his wants.", "To answer the question about my children. I have full custody of them. Their father wasn\u2019t in their life\u2019s for a long time (two years) but, I have chosen to give him time with our children because he is their father and I don\u2019t want my children growing up without him in their lives. It was a family decision. (My children, husband and I all talked about it first)", "Nope. You have a connection to your community that he is trying to break. Seems like an abusive male move.NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Those are not unilateral decisions.", "NTA, its good how he went to the trouble of talking to all of these people, so he now has a list of people he can call and explain how only HE is moving.\n\nIs him moving without you going to causing housing issues mortgage or rent?  If so make that your highest priority to resolve and he can just go a F\\*\\*\\* right off.", "NTA! But you are a kick ass Mam (Welsh for Mom!)\n\nWhen my ex husband and I split up it was very amicable and we were both clear that we would always put our then 3 year old daughter's needs first. We also wanted to ensure that she had equal time with both of us so it's always been necessary to live close to each other to make that work. Regardless of who else we meet. \n\nMy ex husband met his now husband a year after we separated and while his new partner lived at the North of our City we all live in the South. Would it have been convenient for my ex to move in with or close to his new partner? Yes. But it wouldn't have worked so well for our daughter. I met my partner when my daughter was 8 and he had a 7 year old daughter who had lost her Mum. He lived, and still does, in a different city over 2 hours away. Would be have liked to move in together? Hell yes! However, I wasn't prepared to move my daughter away from her Dad and quite rightly didn't want to uproot his daughter from her home and friends when she had already lost her Mum. So our whole relationship of nearly 11 years has been travelling back and forth to make it work while ensuring we were doing the best for our kids. \n\nBoth our daughter's left for University a few months ago and we can finally live together somewhere we both choose. We're very excited! \n\nYour children's needs and wellbeing must always come first. No matter who you fall in love with.", "NTA and he must have been dropped on his head as a child. How TF did he even think he was going to get away with that?? I agree, tell him bye bye and don't let the door hit you when the good Lord split you.

But he is CLEARLY planning to.\n\nNowhere does she say it\u2019s only her family that matters. But he full well went in knowing they had an agreement that she wanted to wait for her son to graduate. Also it\u2019s not just her family. They are married, that is now his family too. And not only that, it\u2019s not like he uprooted his life to move to where she is.
