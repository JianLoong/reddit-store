The ex is mad because she can\u2019t keep selling the expensive clothes for her own profit.", "NTA. I am an attorney who has done custody. Send her in clean clothes. Shouldn't matter if they are Walmart or designer. You can keep the designer. She should send back the designer clothes though she LEGALLY doesn't have to do so.", "NTA. She's jealous of Emily and doesn't like that her daughter will associate you and Emily with good clothes. She's also probably selling them on Poshmark or a local consignment and pocketing the money.\n\nIf you and Emily stay together you're going to have to keep your daughter's stuff you buy separate. At least until she's old enough to stand up to her mom. Otherwise you will end up with a new problem where Emily's kids have better stuff than your daughter and she feels like she is second class.", "NTA - you are doing the right thing because mom is probably giving away clothes your daughter really loves. If you keep the clothes, at least your daughter knows her favourite items will be waiting for her. \n\nJust a bit off topic, but I think it is so cool your girlfriend is actively involving your daughter with her kids and makes sure she doesn't feel like the odd one out. She's treating your daughter as an equal and that is exceptionally heart-warming. I hope the girls grow closer as they age. Don't be surprised if pretty soon the girls will want for you all to live together.\n\nAs far as the ex goes, she's being a total hater. It would be best to get one of those parenting apps and communicate that way.", "NTA\n\nMom is bitter/uncomfortable. \nDon't send the expensive clothes over there. She's just trying to hurt you/Helen by weaponizing them.\n\nTry not to listen to her comments.  You can't win this petty fight.\n\nIf you asked her to send clothes, she'd probably bash you for not providing them for her. Expensive clothes get given away, cheaper clothes get made fun of.", "NTA I don't think this requires more explanation", "NTA \n\nAnyone here can see she is likely selling those clothes not donating them, or k\u00e4se she would be doing the same with her regular clothes. \n\nYou're just getting the salt thrown back inti your eyes because you're now messing with your ex's new business.", "NTA - she is selling the clothes not donating - what ever she is sent to u on wash and return I. The same outfit", "Eh, NTA. I have opinions about kids wearing designer bullshit but I\u2019ll keep that to myself. She was literally stealing though. She ain\u2019t robin-hood.", "NTA. Sounds like dealing with her is a catch 22. Tell her to just give the dirty clothes straight back to you if she\u2019s complaining about the laundry. You can wash them at your place. I doubt that\u2019s a real reason though. Sounds like she\u2019s just salty.", "NTA\n\nI have no idea what your ex is doing with all the clothes but see no reason why you would want to be involved. Send your daughter with clothes you don't mind losing.", "NTA. My ex husband always struggled with his ex wife about their kids\u2019 clothes - they split clothes cost 50/50 but she kept everything good and sent them to us in old ratty stuff. She couldn\u2019t get it through her head that her actions were only hurting their kids, as they were the ones who suffered from the embarrassment of wearing torn and too small clothing to school.", "MTA, your ex is a jealous harpy.", "NTA\n\nThe clothes are for your daughter. It'd be fine IMO if they sometimes stayed at her moms house. It's not fine her mom is giving them away. Send her in the clothes you don't care to ever see again.", "NTA. I went through this with my exes second wife. The solution was a designated outfit to wear for pick up. (We were one week on/one week off). That lasted about a year.", "NTA. I hate to be the cynical old person here but it's entirely possible that your daughters brand names clothes were getting hocked either online or through a consignment shop. That would explain why she is now complaining about you sending her over wearing cheap clothes.", "I believe you Ex was not donating the clothes but selling them.  She is mad that she has lost that income.\n\nHave your EX return all the branded clothing, if she wants Ilsa to wear those clothes at her house.\n\nYour re not going crazy.  You Ex is playing games with you.\n\nNTA", "She knows what she\u2019s doing and should stop playing games. NTA", "NTA, your ex is jealous and seems to be only trying to create problems. \n\nYou're playing her games when you let her actions to cause you to think you are going crazy. Figure out how to stop her actions. Example: not arguing over a phone. If she causes an argument on the phone, politely hand up, call her back in a day. Repeat and repeat, until she realizes shes not going to get the reaction she wants from you.", "Definately NTA and for what its worth i think you are handling the situation great. Do not feel bad for yourself.", "Super NTA. Ex is making a major mistake.", "NTA \n\nHang in there your doing a great job!", "NTA she is definitely playing a game. At a guess, she is re-selling the clothes.\n\nMy sister shares 2 daughters with her ex bf. They have completely different opinions about how to dress them and any clothes they wear when they go to their dad's place might never be seen again. So they both have completely different sets of clothings for their daughters in their homes. When the daughters go from one home to the other, they have only the clothes on their backs. Maybe not ideal but that's how it has to be. Same for you.", "Nta", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
