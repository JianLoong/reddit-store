The ex is mad because she can\u2019t keep selling the expensive clothes for her own profit.", "NTA. I am an attorney who has done custody. Send her in clean clothes. Shouldn't matter if they are Walmart or designer. You can keep the designer. She should send back the designer clothes though she LEGALLY doesn't have to do so.", "NTA. She's jealous of Emily and doesn't like that her daughter will associate you and Emily with good clothes. She's also probably selling them on Poshmark or a local consignment and pocketing the money.\n\nIf you and Emily stay together you're going to have to keep your daughter's stuff you buy separate.

Otherwise you will end up with a new problem where Emily's kids have better stuff than your daughter and she feels like she is second class.", "NTA - you are doing the right thing because mom is probably giving away clothes your daughter really loves. If you keep the clothes, at least your daughter knows her favourite items will be waiting for her. \n\nJust a bit off topic, but I think it is so cool your girlfriend is actively involving your daughter with her kids and makes sure she doesn't feel like the odd one out. She's treating your daughter as an equal and that is exceptionally heart-warming. I hope the girls grow closer as they age. Don't be surprised if pretty soon the girls will want for you all to live together.\n\nAs far as the ex goes, she's being a total hater.

At a guess, she is re-selling the clothes.\n\nMy sister shares 2 daughters with her ex bf. They have completely different opinions about how to dress them and any clothes they wear when they go to their dad's place might never be seen again. So they both have completely different sets of clothings for their daughters in their homes. When the daughters go from one home to the other, they have only the clothes on their backs.
