My roommate and I let someone stay with us a couple of months to try and help her, it backfired miserably on us. She ate our food like there was no tomorrow, didn't work, and stole my hygiene supplies and his medicine. After two months he'd had enough, and I woke up to him telling her \"get your s**t and GTFO NOW!!\" It was 2 a.m. and raining, but I felt zero guilt about handing her stuff out the door and locking it behind her. I was fed up way before that but didn't tell him because I was trying to keep the peace.", "Additional context: right up until last night i have been nothing but diplomatic and cordial with this person with very rare exception. When i initially informed them I wanted them to move out in June, they attacked my character and insulted me. I didn\u2019t respond at all. I merely said, if that\u2019s how you feel then this shouldn\u2019t be a problem. You should go live somewhere else if you don\u2019t like living with us, and that none of this was personal, this living arrangement was just no longer working for my partner and I and left it at that. I forgot to mention above that this person has also been extremely disrespectful with noise. Both having large groups of loud drunk people over waking my partner and I up when we have work early in the morning. The original final straw that caused me to tell them they needed to find somewhere else to live was being woken up from a nap I was taking before a late night shift by him having obnoxiously loud sex with his not actual girlfriend. (Literally everytime she came over it sounded like a women\u2019s tennis match was happening down the hall). Anyway end rant", "NTA I don't blame you at all for unloading the inconsiderate thief.

Some places have laws that can slow down eviction up 9 months. You aren't likely to have problems, but if you forcibly remove him without having gone through the correct legal process, he could end up suing you for loss of housing", "NTA. Get this person out of there, and also ask him not to contact you again for constantly betraying your trust in him and his actions.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him a warning, he kept going. Generally speaking, people tend to ignore messy roommates as long as they fulfill their financial obligations. But here behaviours are actual health hazards and you are doing the right thing by putting your health first. \n\nGranted, 2 weeks to find a new house isn't ideal. However it isn't your fault so don't let him make you feel bad about it. You've been quite generous, more than I'd have been, by giving him a pass so many times. \n\nYou handed this quite maturely too, so well done.

If anything I was maybe a little bit overly aggressive by essentially threatening to get a group of my union brothers to physically remove him if he didn\u2019t comply on his own, but honestly at this point with the brazen lack of respect and the audacity of him to continue to steal food from me after being very politely told he needed to find somewhere else to live I don\u2019t even feel bad. Dude has essentially stolen a couple hundred dollars worth of food and booze from my partner and I. If this were someone who was hypothetically a guest at my house at a party or something, or maybe crashing for a couple days, I wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about physically removing them the first time it happened. Just wanted some reassurance that I\u2019m not acting out of line I guess. Thanks for the response.", "Yah I might do that tomorrow. I tried doing a google search about what both parties rights are in the situation, and it was difficult to find anything specifically relating to someone who is essentially unofficially subletting a room in the house. Like I\u2019m not a landlord and he\u2019s not actually a tenant, so it\u2019s hard to find clear cut information about either of our legal rights since the terms of everything are super wishy washy.", "He\u2019s not actually on the lease so I\u2019m not sure he has any legal footing to sue. It was a handshake type arrangement so as far as I\u2019m concerned he\u2019s basically been a guest in the house for an extended period.I know he hasn\u2019t been living here long enough to invoke any type of squatter\u2019s rights but I\u2019ll definitely look into if there\u2019s any other relevant laws that could affect the situation.", "Oh I\u2019m not worried about them contacting me again. We don\u2019t even speak when passing each other in common areas or the hall and haven\u2019t for over a year. The only thing I can imagine he\u2019d bother to attempt to contact me over would be the security deposit, which I\u2019m not going to be returning at this point given the theft, and the labor that my partner and I have done, and will have to do when he leaves, to clean up after his mess.", "The two weeks thing is tough for sure. But I also told him on April 1st it was time for him to find somewhere else. And when that occurred I had given him until June 1 which is 60 days. Double what is legally required and considered standard notice basically everywhere. It only became two weeks because the disrespectful behavior and theft continued despite all of my attempts to be polite civil and diplomatic about it. Thanks for the reply", "Yah I really do feel like I\u2019ve been exceedingly patient, forgiving, and civil up until last night when I simply just had enough with the brazen disrespect", "It was both of our food that was getting stolen. The only thing that he was exclusively taking of my partners and not mine was the alchohol, and that actually stopped after only about 2 or 3 times and a stern warning. But fair enough. I actually did almost kick him out about a year ago but he managed to weasel his way into me feeling a bit sympathetic for him because of some ultimately empty apologies. I feel I was probably less an asshole for letting him stay than I was gullible. But point taken.", "Oh no, you're not out of line at all!! I think you handled it well, and even if the \"union brothers\" thing was an empty threat, you were making it very clear you were tired of the BS. And hey, he still had two weeks after that absolute final warning, which was WAY more than he could have gotten (like I said, 2 a.m. in the rain but IDGAF about that, I was glad to see her go lol).\n\nIncidentally, at one point I'd bought the girl who'd been staying with us a week's worth of groceries (she even came to the store with me and picked them out, but that was partly because I didn't trust her in the house by herself) to try to be nice, she ate them in 3 days and started in on our food again.", "If they've lived there for two years you absolutely would have to go through an eviction process. Anything after 30 days requires legal action. Being on the lease or not. The law would still see that as being their legal residence. I would get the paperwork started immediately. But also NTA because that behavior would piss me off to no end and they would need to leave lol.", "I get feeling sympathetic and being gullible, I just think you kind of let your partner take the short end of the stick. Like the mildew with the mold allergy alone should be enough to kick him out immediately. \n\nBut yes, now that you are kicking him out, check tenants rights laws. Even without a lease, if he can prove tenancy he might be a pain to get rid of.", "Oh the union brothers thing absolutely was not an empty threat. If I asked my brothers to, they would help me toss this dude out like a frisbee in the most literal sense lol. Like I texted a couple today and they were all like absolutely no doubt before I even got into why exactly I needed him gone. Their only question was when.", "Thanks for the info. I don\u2019t really feel like this guy has the means or will to legally challenge anything. And fwiw I think at this point he\u2019s also scared enough of me that he probably will just leave without issue anyway. Which tbh I don\u2019t feel great about. I don\u2019t really like to use intimidation as a means to compel someone to do something. But in this case I felt like I had to make it pretty clear that he\u2019s used up any good will or empathy I\u2019ve had for him, and so I made it clear he isn\u2019t going to be living here on may 1st wether or not we did things the easy way or the hard way. \n\nYou may not have the answer to this question but I\u2019m going to ask it anyway. If I forcibly remove this guy because he doesn\u2019t leave of his own volition, am I actually legally culpable here? Given that i am not actually the property owner, im just a tenant, and he is basically just paying rent to me, can I actually be sued? Or would he have to sue the landlord? Either situation is bad obviously, because if I get my landlord sued im sure my partner and I would also end up looking for a new place to live as a result. But wether or not I have actual legal culpability is pretty relevant with how I proceed from here. Also, does the fact that this person has repeatedly stolen from my partner and I play into their rights as a tenant? Like, it would seem pretty fucked up if I was legally required to continue living with someone who has repeatedly stolen from me.", "This being if they don't leave on their own. If they leave with no issue then cool, but if they decide not to then legal action definitely required.", "You\u2019re not wrong tbh. My partner did want me to kick him out for a while, but just for context I also wasn\u2019t expecting to still be living in this house at this point in the first place. The whole point of having a room mate was to allow us to save more money so we could purchase our own home and not have to deal with a landlord or room mates any longer. So my thought process was, hey we stick it out with this guy for another 6 months to a year(from about a year ago) to get enough capital together for a down payment on our own house, and we just both suck it up to make that happen. Unfortunately that didn\u2019t quite work out financially how we had planned, and now here we are a year later with the same shitty room mate. At least we\u2019re not gonna have to deal with the situation for a whole nother year I guess.", ">If I forcibly remove this guy because he doesn\u2019t leave of his own volition, am I actually legally culpable here? \n\nYes. Obviously. I'm not sure how that's even a question.", "Thanks so much for the explanation \ud83d\ude44", "Buddy, if you have to be told that using force on someone is illegal, there is no hope for you. I don't know how you survived into what I presume is adulthood.", "Where I live you must give a months notice if their receive mail at the house.", "I don't have specific knowledge on that question tbh. I just know that if you were to try to physically force him to leave and he called the cops, they'll tell you that you can't do that and that it would be considered a civil matter and you can't make him leave, and that you'll have to go file eviction papers and that will give him X amount of days to get out. After he's served those papers, if he's not out by that date then they can escort him out. That's one of the biggest problems with having roommates. It's a safety net for them to an extent. Even if it sucks for you.", "If you\u2019ve said where you are, I haven\u2019t caught it, but answers to legal questions on eviction almost certainly depend on where they occur.", "NTA I think you are a doormat for keeping them as a roommate for two years. I would have kicked them out a long time ago. Taking your stuff without permission and not cleaning is a dealbreaker. You should start being more of an asshole and not let people walk all over you.", "NTA. Kick him out now!", "Fair. I try and give people the benefit of the doubt that they\u2019re gonna try and do better but clearly that was foolish in this case", "If you live in the U.S you can try your courthouse, not the part where they have trials but where you renew your tags. I know mine has shitloads of pamphlets on tenants rights, there might even be someone there you could ask.", "PA", "Your going to jail if you forcibly remove him, and if he's got even half a brain he would go and get a restraining order while your waiting to see a judge, so when you do make bail you damn sure won't be able to go home."]}
