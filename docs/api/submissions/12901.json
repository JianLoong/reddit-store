Now according to my girlfriend, Dave is gay and she told me this before he came to our apartment (this will become important shortly).\n\nMy girlfriend invited Dave to our home and I met him at our apartment for the first time. In the beginning, he seemed like a swell guy. He told me stories about my girlfriend in highschool and you know, it was a fun time. We all went out for some ice-cream and I thought that would be the end of it.\n\nThen Dave and my girlfriend went shopping together the next weekend and when they came back, my girlfriend wanted to show me what she had bought. She had been struggling with this sundress she had gotten and just came out half naked. I think I audibly said \"What are you doing? Dave is here.\" She just said, \"he's gay\".\n\nIt was weird but I just went along with it (I thought maybe this was just normal). But it didn't just stop there, in the next couple of months, it just got weirder. He would constantly pinch her butt and all this weird shit that like straight friends just don't do to each other.\n\nBut you know what...I thought maybe its my conservative upbringing getting in my head and so I didn't say anything. Then, just last week, I came home early from my research-lab, and I saw Dave cuddling with my girlfriend in our bed, and I just snapped. I threw him out of the apartment and then got into a fight with my girlfriend.\n\nShe said, \"this wasn't a big deal, she cuddles with her girlfriends all the time\", to which I was like \"wtf, who else are you cuddling with?\". She said \"only with the girls and Dave, cause he's gay\". We fought for a while, her telling me I was being an awful person by kicking out her friend over absolutely nothing, and I just said that she were literally in our bed with him.\n\nAfter a while I just went to a friends house. He told me it was weird but it shouldn't be that big a deal because Dave is gay. I know he's gay, but even then this doesn't feel ok. Nevertheless, AITA for kicking out Dave?\n\n**Edit:** Dave's in long-distance relationship with a guy back in the city from where he moved. He facetimes him frequently and that's what confirmed he was gay for me.

If Dave was violating your boundaries, then you should have had a conversation with your girlfriend well below this bed incident - say, after the butt pinching moment.

I\u2019m sure Dave and your gf would respect a measured tone. \n\nAnd I also disagree with most of the people above - I\u2019m sure in many parts of the world this body language is unacceptable. But where I come from this kind of physical affection between gay men and women is commonplace. And indeed, men who refuse to \u201callow\u201d their women to have physical affection with others is seen as toxic. \n\nLook at it this way - you\u2019re not likely going to win this one. Getting angry like this, when in all likelihood Dave is not a threat to your relationship - will achieve nothing. She\u2019s not going to get rid of her friend, and now there will be a permanent awkwardness. According to them, they did nothing wrong. If you\u2019d spoken about this calmly to your gf, chances are she would\u2019ve respected your boundaries. Irrespective of the circumstance, \u201cI just snapped\u201d rarely results in N-T-A judgments. Don\u2019t allow yourself to get to a point where you snap.

Neither are claiming it is a valid boundary.", "I\u2019m not accusing anyone in the original post of victim blaming. I\u2019m accusing the commenter of victim blaming and being unable to acknowledge that communication is a two way street. If I got repeatedly shut down for bringing up something by my partner, I would probably gaslight myself that I\u2019m the problem till it\u2019s too late and they finally tip me over the edge BY CUDDLING WITH SOMEONE ELSE IN MY BED", "Yeah, and I'm telling you that you're using the term \"victim blaming\" incorrectly lol. You need to reread the post. Op never had a real conversation about this before the cuddling incident. They only ever had a discussion after, when emotions on both sides were high. Both op and gf were in the wrong. He doesn't get to blow up when they've not had a proper discussion about boundaries, so I can see why gf would kind of brush it off. To her. An issue hasn't been raised, so yeah she's thinking \"what's the problem, I cuddle with all my friends?\" But it was shitty of her to cuddle with friend in the bed she shares with op."]}
