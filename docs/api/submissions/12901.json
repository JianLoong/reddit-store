Almost 5 months back, my girlfriend reconnected with an old-friend from highschool (who I'll call Dave) as he was moving to our city. Now according to my girlfriend, Dave is gay and she told me this before he came to our apartment (this will become important shortly).\n\nMy girlfriend invited Dave to our home and I met him at our apartment for the first time. In the beginning, he seemed like a swell guy. He told me stories about my girlfriend in highschool and you know, it was a fun time. We all went out for some ice-cream and I thought that would be the end of it.\n\nThen Dave and my girlfriend went shopping together the next weekend and when they came back, my girlfriend wanted to show me what she had bought. She had been struggling with this sundress she had gotten and just came out half naked. I think I audibly said \"What are you doing? Dave is here.\" She just said, \"he's gay\".\n\nIt was weird but I just went along with it (I thought maybe this was just normal). But it didn't just stop there, in the next couple of months, it just got weirder. He would constantly pinch her butt and all this weird shit that like straight friends just don't do to each other.\n\nBut you know what...I thought maybe its my conservative upbringing getting in my head and so I didn't say anything. Then, just last week, I came home early from my research-lab, and I saw Dave cuddling with my girlfriend in our bed, and I just snapped. I threw him out of the apartment and then got into a fight with my girlfriend.\n\nShe said, \"this wasn't a big deal, she cuddles with her girlfriends all the time\", to which I was like \"wtf, who else are you cuddling with?\". She said \"only with the girls and Dave, cause he's gay\". We fought for a while, her telling me I was being an awful person by kicking out her friend over absolutely nothing, and I just said that she were literally in our bed with him.\n\nAfter a while I just went to a friends house. He told me it was weird but it shouldn't be that big a deal because Dave is gay. I know he's gay, but even then this doesn't feel ok. Nevertheless, AITA for kicking out Dave?\n\nEdit: Dave's in long-distance relationship with a guy back in the city from where he moved. He facetimes him frequently and that's what confirmed he was gay for me.

If Dave was violating your boundaries, then you should have had a conversation with your girlfriend well below this bed incident - say, after the butt pinching moment.

I\u2019m sure Dave and your gf would respect a measured tone. \n\nAnd I also disagree with most of the people above - I\u2019m sure in many parts of the world this body language is unacceptable. But where I come from this kind of physical affection between gay men and women is commonplace. And indeed, men who refuse to \u201callow\u201d their women to have physical affection with others is seen as toxic. \n\nLook at it this way - you\u2019re not likely going to win this one. Getting angry like this, when in all likelihood Dave is not a threat to your relationship - will achieve nothing. She\u2019s not going to get rid of her friend, and now there will be a permanent awkwardness. According to them, they did nothing wrong. If you\u2019d spoken about this calmly to your gf, chances are she would\u2019ve respected your boundaries. Irrespective of the circumstance, \u201cI just snapped\u201d rarely results in N-T-A judgments. Don\u2019t allow yourself to get to a point where you snap.

No. Im a straight woman, I don't go touching my girl friends butts. I might cuddle with my brother or my dad because you know, they are my brother and my dad, but I don't cuddle with no friend. NTA.", "Read the edit and YTA, it's not that you don't want her cuddling with another man it's that you don't want her cuddling with ANYONE except you and your dog. Trying to restrict her being physcially affectionate with anyone but you feels very insecure and controlling. Not wanting her to turn to others for physical comfort is shitty.", "NTA \n\nGay or not, his actions are making you uncomfortable. Also, pinching her ass and stuff is just a weird thing to do", "NTA - It doesn\u2019t matter if Dave is gay. That was your bed and bedroom. Super disrespectful. Gf and Dave should be apologizing for crossing your boundary instead of doubling down.", "YTA. HE'S GAY. YOU'RE INSECURE. Jealousy is not cute on you. Plenty of straight girls have this kind of relationship with their gay friends BECAUSE THEY'RE GAY SO IT'S NOT SEXUAL. YOU are the only one sexualizing it. If your girlfriend wants to cuddle with her friends that's her choice, not yours. FFS", "I'm big on platonic cuddling. So I found a partner who is OK with my cuddly nature. Yknow, the whole aligned values thing. NTA.", "NTA.\nI smell cheating.\nHe is most likely bi or he is lying about being gay.", "Nta. Your gf is cheating.", "NTA\n\nBull shit just because dude is gay. Shes out of line.", "Dave is Bi-", "Right, this is what I was thinking. I'm straight but have LGBT+ friends, and I wouldn't dare cuddle them in bed unless they or I were having a breakdown and needed a hug. Tbh, Dave is rather bi and into OPs gf, or he doesn't know social cues, though by the sounds of this OPs gf doesn't care gow he feels.", "Found Dave\n\nETA: I'm going with NTA because this was a boundaries issue and in my opinion OP should have talked since the moment he felt uncomfortable. However I agree with alleged Dave here, that saying that the guy is pretending is a harmful narrative. This should have been a calmed conversation.", "This is ridiculous. I hope you retain that judgement if the gf came home to her bf cuddling with his \u201cgay\u201d female friend in their bed. Come to think of it, that would be a great excuse if he ever decided to cheat !", "My guy you are not reacting strongly enough I would\u2019ve sent Dave to the hospital and your GF out the door", "They asked if the situation was reversed, not if his GF was cuddling with a girl.", "In high school, mom saw a photo of my best friend sitting on my lap with my arms around her.\n\nShe approached me with it and asked if I was gay. \n\nThat was the day I learned it wasn\u2019t just straight men who can\u2019t seem to fathom \u201cintimacy\u201d outside of romantic relationships.\n\nLet this woman cuddle with her friends. Let these people punch each other\u2019s butts. If OP\u2019s too jealous to handle platonic shows of intimacy and goofy friend behaviors, he should have an adult conversation about it. But he\u2019s also walking a very fine line of giving the impression that being her boyfriend means he owns the rights to her body. That only he gets to be in close physical proximity to her or see her in her bra.\n\nProhibiting her from cuddling with her friends or changing clothes in front of them (something she has definitely done for at least the last 5 years, if not longer) is policing how she\u2019s allowed to behave with her friends. It\u2019s controlling.", "You don\u2019t get to say whether it\u2019s okay for Dave to pinch his high school best friend\u2019s ass. You\u2019re not OP\u2019s girlfriend, it\u2019s her ass and only she gets to say whether she\u2019s okay with her friends pinching it.", "Oh, hmm. Not sure how I managed to misread that. My bad lol", "Right? I would have been OUTRAGED if anyone did that to me, gay, straight, bi, whatever. I'm a boomer so some workers had to tolerate a lot in the 70's and 80's but that's straight up SA", "Right? I would have been OUTRAGED if anyone did that to me, gay, straight, bi, whatever. I'm a boomer so some workers had to tolerate a lot in the 70's and 80's but that's straight up SA", "Oh dont get me wrong I was weirded out by it, but when everyone is laughing including the person who's boobs cupped it's hard to judge. They were all friends so I'd say it was they're dynamic, like friendly flirting. Not that it makes a difference but he wasn't they're boss, wasnt responsible for any of them. \n\nI'm not gonna make an excuse for him, not how I'd conduct myself with female employees.", "Then you try again with a more serious tone and thought out words fully explaining your feelings and boundaries outside of the moment it\u2019s happening. Especially when the friend isn\u2019t in the dang room. Ya know. How adults should address their issues.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 thanks man. I needed a good laugh. \n\nShe's definitely having an affair, or they're riding the line of it. \n\nBut I'm 100% certain dude is not gay or either is bisexual and likes your girl. Either way he's not 100% gay if he's picking and cuddling your gf.", "YTA for your chewing gum comment.", "But is it the tingly kind?!", "I feel people forget gay men can also be misogynistic lol", "Victim blaming kek"]}
