Almost 5 months back, my girlfriend reconnected with an old-friend from highschool (who I'll call Dave) as he was moving to our city. Now according to my girlfriend, Dave is gay and she told me this before he came to our apartment (this will become important shortly).\n\nMy girlfriend invited Dave to our home and I met him at our apartment for the first time. In the beginning, he seemed like a swell guy. He told me stories about my girlfriend in highschool and you know, it was a fun time. We all went out for some ice-cream and I thought that would be the end of it.\n\nThen Dave and my girlfriend went shopping together the next weekend and when they came back, my girlfriend wanted to show me what she had bought. She had been struggling with this sundress she had gotten and just came out half naked. I think I audibly said \"What are you doing? Dave is here.\" She just said, \"he's gay\".\n\nIt was weird but I just went along with it (I thought maybe this was just normal). But it didn't just stop there, in the next couple of months, it just got weirder. He would constantly pinch her butt and all this weird shit that like straight friends just don't do to each other.\n\nBut you know what...I thought maybe its my conservative upbringing getting in my head and so I didn't say anything. Then, just last week, I came home early from my research-lab, and I saw Dave cuddling with my girlfriend in our bed, and I just snapped. I threw him out of the apartment and then got into a fight with my girlfriend.\n\nShe said, \"this wasn't a big deal, she cuddles with her girlfriends all the time\", to which I was like \"wtf, who else are you cuddling with?\". She said \"only with the girls and Dave, cause he's gay\". We fought for a while, her telling me I was being an awful person by kicking out her friend over absolutely nothing, and I just said that she were literally in our bed with him.\n\nAfter a while I just went to a friends house. He told me it was weird but it shouldn't be that big a deal because Dave is gay. I know he's gay, but even then this doesn't feel ok. Nevertheless, AITA for kicking out Dave?\n\n**1st Edit:** Dave's in long-distance relationship with a guy back in the city from where he moved. He facetimes him frequently and that's what confirmed he was gay for me. But I guess he could have been bi-sexual, not that it matters because she shouldn't be cuddling with anyone like that, regardless of their hardware preference, but me and/or our dog.\n\n**2nd Edit:** So here's the action plan. I'll have a conversation with my girlfriend that her actions with dave (the cuddling, pinching, and her being half-naked infront of him) make me uncomfortable. I'll tell her its a dealbreaker for me and that she can't be doing those thing with any other man but me. Also no lesbians.\n\nIf she wants to keep doing it, good for her, but we can't be together.\n\nI'll talk to Dave, tell him that this stuff is inappropriate, and tell him to stop doing that sort of stuff. It ain't his place, and I don't want to have to put him in his place.", "created_utc": 1679472316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ybkou/aita_for_kicking_out_my_girlfriends_friend_out_of/", "score": 651, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ive got a feeling Dave is not gay, as ive never seen any gay friend do anymore than hug someone, which is just a way of greeting or saying goodbye.

The problem is your girlfriend, and who she is.", "YTA and you\u2019re all insane. If Dave was violating your boundaries, then you should have had a conversation with your girlfriend well below this bed incident - say, after the butt pinching moment. Biting your tongue and snapping never wins out over communication. Making demands is never a good look over expressing discomfort. I\u2019m sure Dave and your gf would respect a measured tone. \n\nAnd I also disagree with most of the people above - I\u2019m sure in many parts of the world this body language is unacceptable. But where I come from this kind of physical affection between gay men and women is commonplace. And indeed, men who refuse to \u201callow\u201d their women to have physical affection with others is seen as toxic. \n\nLook at it this way - you\u2019re not likely going to win this one. Getting angry like this, when in all likelihood Dave is not a threat to your relationship - will achieve nothing. She\u2019s not going to get rid of her friend, and now there will be a permanent awkwardness. According to them, they did nothing wrong. If you\u2019d spoken about this calmly to your gf, chances are she would\u2019ve respected your boundaries. Irrespective of the circumstance, \u201cI just snapped\u201d rarely results in N-T-A judgments. Don\u2019t allow yourself to get to a point where you snap.

You\u2019ve said you had a conservative upbringing, so i\u2019m betting you don\u2019t get to have affection and intimacy outside of your romantic relationships, which is pretty common but ultimately very sad. Humans need touch, not just sexual touch, and it is sorely lacking in our society. It is actively hurting us to have a mindset that physical affection and intimacy are only allowed within sexual context. \n\nThat said, I understand you\u2019re not comfortable, but again that is a you problem to solve.

Feels like she's trying to gaslight you into acceptance.\n\nYour feelings are valid. A discussion needs to be had regarding boundaries and expectations, as well as determining if there's something you've missed in regards to your partners emotional needs. \n\nI cannot imagine how much it must suck to realize you don't truly know someone after 4 years. \ud83e\udd15  Best of luck!", "Sounds like his door might swing both ways.

Many young women feel comfortable being flirty and sexual with a gay friend because there's little to no chance of him wanting to take things further.  So while she'd never allow an ass slap from a straight man, she would from a gay man.  That's fine, for her. But you are allowed to have different boundaries and what should happen here is that you discuss those boundaries and she either respects your boundaries or ends the relationship if she can't respect them. \n\nEventually I concluded that regardless of the sexualities of genders of the parties involved I was uncomfortable with my GF being sexual with anyone other than me.  I think that in large part came from being fairly close to the queer community, most people are not 100% gay or straight but rather sit somewhere on a spectrum.  I personally know a few guys who consider themselves straight but who have experimented and I know MANY girls who have done the same. I also know many gay men who have done sexual things with women, doesn't make them not gay just means the stars aligned and this experience happened.", "NTA.

He didn't and has to face the consequence of being ejected from your place.\n\nI'd be having a Frank conversation with your GF about what you feel is respectful in this situation and be open to an honest but fair dialogue. If you do this, keep your calm and avoid inflammatory language. Especially anything that could be misconstrued as homophobic.
