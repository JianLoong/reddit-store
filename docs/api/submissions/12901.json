Almost 5 months back, my girlfriend reconnected with an old-friend from highschool (who I'll call Dave) as he was moving to our city. Now according to my girlfriend, Dave is gay and she told me this before he came to our apartment (this will become important shortly).\n\nMy girlfriend invited Dave to our home and I met him at our apartment for the first time. In the beginning, he seemed like a swell guy. He told me stories about my girlfriend in highschool and you know, it was a fun time. We all went out for some ice-cream and I thought that would be the end of it.\n\nThen Dave and my girlfriend went shopping together the next weekend and when they came back, my girlfriend wanted to show me what she had bought. She had been struggling with this sundress she had gotten and just came out half naked. I think I audibly said \"What are you doing? Dave is here.\" She just said, \"he's gay\".\n\nIt was weird but I just went along with it (I thought maybe this was just normal). But it didn't just stop there, in the next couple of months, it just got weirder. He would constantly pinch her butt and all this weird shit that like straight friends just don't do to each other.\n\nBut you know what...I thought maybe its my conservative upbringing getting in my head and so I didn't say anything. Then, just last week, I came home early from my research-lab, and I saw Dave cuddling with my girlfriend in our bed, and I just snapped. I threw him out of the apartment and then got into a fight with my girlfriend.\n\nShe said, \"this wasn't a big deal, she cuddles with her girlfriends all the time\", to which I was like \"wtf, who else are you cuddling with?\". She said \"only with the girls and Dave, cause he's gay\". We fought for a while, her telling me I was being an awful person by kicking out her friend over absolutely nothing, and I just said that she were literally in our bed with him.\n\nAfter a while I just went to a friends house. He told me it was weird but it shouldn't be that big a deal because Dave is gay. I know he's gay, but even then this doesn't feel ok. Nevertheless, AITA for kicking out Dave?\n\nEdit: Dave's in long-distance relationship with a guy back in the city from where he moved. He facetimes him frequently and that's what confirmed he was gay for me. But I guess he could have been bi-sexual, not that it matters because she shouldn't be cuddling with anyone like that, regardless of their hardware preference, but me and/or our dog.", "created_utc": 1679472316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ybkou/aita_for_kicking_out_my_girlfriends_friend_out_of/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dave doesn\u2019t seem gay from what you\u2019ve explained here.

If her answer is \"it'd be just fine\" then I'd kind of wonder what her boundaries are, and ask her. Next thing you know, you could come home and she's naked and asleep in your bed with this guy. Or they're showering together. When does the \"oh he's gay\" excuse draw the line between what's acceptable and what's not, in her mind?", "NTA. Ive got a feeling Dave is not gay, as ive never seen any gay friend do anymore than hug someone, which is just a way of greeting or saying goodbye. Just because hes gay doesnt really make sense for him to do be doing things people in a relationship usually do. Like, pinching her butt is weird.", "Both of you are fixating on Dave's sexuality like his interior life is the deciding factor. It's not. The actions stand alone. \n\nESH. Her for cheating on you with this ridiculously flimsy excuse, Dave for repeatedly crossing your boundaries while living with you, your friend for excusing this with a stereotype, and you for making this a fight about Dave and who he is. The problem is your girlfriend, and who she is.", "YTA and you\u2019re all insane. If Dave was violating your boundaries, then you should have had a conversation with your girlfriend well below this bed incident - say, after the butt pinching moment. Biting your tongue and snapping never wins out over communication. Making demands is never a good look over expressing discomfort. I\u2019m sure Dave and your gf would respect a measured tone. \n\nAnd I also disagree with most of the people above - I\u2019m sure in many parts of the world this body language is unacceptable. But where I come from this kind of physical affection between gay men and women is commonplace. And indeed, men who refuse to \u201callow\u201d their women to have physical affection with others is seen as toxic. \n\nLook at it this way - you\u2019re not likely going to win this one. Getting angry like this, when in all likelihood Dave is not a threat to your relationship - will achieve nothing. She\u2019s not going to get rid of her friend, and now there will be a permanent awkwardness. According to them, they did nothing wrong. If you\u2019d spoken about this calmly to your gf, chances are she would\u2019ve respected your boundaries. Irrespective of the circumstance, \u201cI just snapped\u201d rarely results in N-T-A judgments. Don\u2019t allow yourself to get to a point where you snap.

If she doesn\u2019t care that a *gay* guy is pinching her ass, then that means it\u2019s part of their mutual body language. If he is uncomfortable with it, the. He should check-in with his girlfriend. The fact that he didn\u2019t bring that up with her before suggests either a) she was uncomfortable when he pinched her and he is neglectful or, more likely, b) he could tell she didn\u2019t care and it\u2019s only him that\u2019s bothered.

She needs to recognize that OP doesn't know Dave like she does and be more considerate about checking certain behaviors, at least in OP's presence until she has a chance to listen to and ease any of OP's concerns (within reason), and Dave (*maybe* because so far he's the only potential non-AH in this situation) needs to recognize that as his friend is now in a serious relationship, it might be time to chill on some old habits that might have been okay when they were kids together but girl now has someone else's feelings to take into consideration. \n\nAs for the butt-pinching making Dave \"secretly not gay and trying to move in on my girl\" \ud83d\ude44, my gay male friends and I regularly (and consentually!) greet/ed each other on a night out with two-handed boob grabs and butt slaps. Some mixed-sexuality friends/friend groups do have that dynamic, precisely *because* there's no \"you're faking your preferences to steal my partner\" bullshit. \n\nYou and your girl both missed the honest and open communication bus and need to hop aboard, and if neither one of you communicated OP's discomfort with the behavior or laid down some boundaries, then Dave's the only one in this situation who's not the AH.

So it sounds like he did try to establish boundaries or at the very least state his concerns. you cannot tell me that she did not know he was uncomfortable with all this. He did try to start the conversation and she blew him off. He might not have been good at trying to start that conversation but he did try to start the conversation. How much talking are you going to do if you bring up something that makes you uncomfortable and your concern is just brushed aside and given excuses for, and the dialogue is shut down by the other party?", "Tbh, it also reeks of misogyny to me. Like... Idc if the touch is sexual or not, no one gave you permission, we aren't that close, and you can't cop a feel just because it doesn't get you hard. It feels like an entitlement to women's bodies.", "I kinda think it's as much freedom from toxic (male) homophobia - boys get told (*a lot*) that all touch is sexual no touching friends evar!!1! Other men will think you're gay and women will think you're molesting them! No hugs for you!!!\n\nSince gay men kinda have to get over that one, they sometimes lose a sense of where the boundary is between \"casual affection\" and \"no, that is in fact a sex touch even if your dick doesn't agree\".", "If I saw my partner in intimate positions with someone else i would absolutely consider that cheating. You don't have to be fucking for it to be cheating.", "Agreed.. it's a lot different for a hug or a kiss on the cheek but pinging their butt and cuddles on the bed?
