{"id": 12901, "submission_id": "11ybkou", "title": "AITA for kicking out my girlfriend's friend out of the house?", "selftext": "My girlfriend (f23) and I (m23) started dating in summer after freshman-year and have been dating for just over 4 years. Almost 5 months back, my girlfriend reconnected with an old-friend from highschool (who I'll call Dave) as he was moving to our city. Now according to my girlfriend, Dave is gay and she told me this before he came to our apartment (this will become important shortly).\n\nMy girlfriend invited Dave to our home and I met him at our apartment for the first time. In the beginning, he seemed like a swell guy. He told me stories about my girlfriend in highschool and you know, it was a fun time. We all went out for some ice-cream and I thought that would be the end of it.\n\nThen Dave and my girlfriend went shopping together the next weekend and when they came back, my girlfriend wanted to show me what she had bought. She had been struggling with this sundress she had gotten and just came out half naked. I think I audibly said \"What are you doing? Dave is here.\" She just said, \"he's gay\".\n\nIt was weird but I just went along with it (I thought maybe this was just normal). But it didn't just stop there, in the next couple of months, it just got weirder. He would constantly pinch her butt and all this weird shit that like straight friends just don't do to each other.\n\nBut you know what...I thought maybe its my conservative upbringing getting in my head and so I didn't say anything. Then, just last week, I came home early from my research-lab, and I saw Dave cuddling with my girlfriend in our bed, and I just snapped. I threw him out of the apartment and then got into a fight with my girlfriend.\n\nShe said, \"this wasn't a big deal, she cuddles with her girlfriends all the time\", to which I was like \"wtf, who else are you cuddling with?\". She said \"only with the girls and Dave, cause he's gay\". We fought for a while, her telling me I was being an awful person by kicking out her friend over absolutely nothing, and I just said that she were literally in our bed with him.\n\nAfter a while I just went to a friends house. He told me it was weird but it shouldn't be that big a deal because Dave is gay. I know he's gay, but even then this doesn't feel ok. Nevertheless, AITA for kicking out Dave?\n\nEdit: Dave's in long-distance relationship with a guy back in the city from where he moved. He facetimes him frequently and that's what confirmed he was gay for me. But I guess he could have been bi-sexual, not that it matters because she shouldn't be cuddling with anyone like that, regardless of their hardware preference, but me and/or our dog.", "created_utc": 1679472316, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ybkou/aita_for_kicking_out_my_girlfriends_friend_out_of/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't care if it's a female friend, a male friend, or anything else under the sun. You just don't do that.

She let another man pinch her butt, see her half naked and cuddle with another man. Why does it matter if the other man is gay, bi or straight? She isn\u2019t. And i hate this \"Oh, he is gay, so he is like the girls\" Eh, no? Especially as if every gay men behave the same. And sexual preference is often not set in stone. \n\nHow often does her female friends pinch her in the butt? Never? Strange...", "I dunno man. Dave doesn\u2019t seem gay from what you\u2019ve explained here. But be that the case is neither here nor there (at least for the main point) if something makes you uncomfortable and it\u2019s a reasonable request, that really should have been the end of it. \n\nNTA, Dave is fishy.", "NTA\n\nYou felt uncomfortable with someone in your house, so you asked them to leave. Pretty simple.", "NTA - you have boundaries and your girlfriend violated it, plain and simple.", "NTA, his sexual orientation doesn\u2019t matter. Both him and your gf don\u2019t respect your relationship or boundaries", "NTA he is not gay you should throw your cheating girl out next", "NTA \n\nJust cause it\u2019s not gonna else to sex doesn\u2019t make it ok.", "NTA. I actually have experienced handsy gay guys like this. It is \"normal\" to some, but for your girlfriend to disregard your feelings on the matter is wrong. You have the right to dislike some other dude touching her, gay or not. It's disrespectful!", "Eh... highschool drama from a bad movie. I love it.  \n\nWhy dont you kick her out as well?  If she is not willing to talk about it\n\nNtA", "Ah, the typical he's gay so it's okay excuse. NTA", "NTA\n\nA big problem in this situation is your girlfriend's lack of respect for your boundaries and your home. It's your bed as well it's not a communal space", "nta\n\neven if he is gay there are personal boundaries you do not cross like pinching butts,\n\nalso with respect of a relationship i would not lay in bed with someone else or walk around half naked.", "Ask her one question and her reaction will tell you everything you need to know, moving forward:\n\nIf a lesbian friend lived with you, pinched your butt, saw you naked or half naked, and cuddled in bed with you...how would SHE feel about that?\n\nIf her answer was \"it'd be unacceptable\" then she has a choice: take her own advice and respect your relationship and the normal boundaries of one. If her answer is \"it'd be just fine\" then I'd kind of wonder what her boundaries are, and ask her. Next thing you know, you could come home and she's naked and asleep in your bed with this guy. Or they're showering together. When does the \"oh he's gay\" excuse draw the line between what's acceptable and what's not, in her mind?", "NTA. Ive got a feeling Dave is not gay, as ive never seen any gay friend do anymore than hug someone, which is just a way of greeting or saying goodbye. Just because hes gay doesnt really make sense for him to do be doing things people in a relationship usually do. Like, pinching her butt is weird.", "Both of you are fixating on Dave's sexuality like his interior life is the deciding factor. It's not. The actions stand alone. \n\nESH. Her for cheating on you with this ridiculously flimsy excuse, Dave for repeatedly crossing your boundaries while living with you, your friend for excusing this with a stereotype, and you for making this a fight about Dave and who he is. The problem is your girlfriend, and who she is.", "YTA and you\u2019re all insane. If Dave was violating your boundaries, then you should have had a conversation with your girlfriend well below this bed incident - say, after the butt pinching moment. Biting your tongue and snapping never wins out over communication. Making demands is never a good look over expressing discomfort. I\u2019m sure Dave and your gf would respect a measured tone. \n\nAnd I also disagree with most of the people above - I\u2019m sure in many parts of the world this body language is unacceptable. But where I come from this kind of physical affection between gay men and women is commonplace. And indeed, men who refuse to \u201callow\u201d their women to have physical affection with others is seen as toxic. \n\nLook at it this way - you\u2019re not likely going to win this one. Getting angry like this, when in all likelihood Dave is not a threat to your relationship - will achieve nothing. She\u2019s not going to get rid of her friend, and now there will be a permanent awkwardness. According to them, they did nothing wrong. If you\u2019d spoken about this calmly to your gf, chances are she would\u2019ve respected your boundaries. Irrespective of the circumstance, \u201cI just snapped\u201d rarely results in N-T-A judgments. Don\u2019t allow yourself to get to a point where you snap. Figure out the best way to communicate your feelings at the appropriate time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she doesn\u2019t care that a *gay* guy is pinching her ass, then that means it\u2019s part of their mutual body language. If he is uncomfortable with it, the. He should check-in with his girlfriend. The fact that he didn\u2019t bring that up with her before suggests either a) she was uncomfortable when he pinched her and he is neglectful or, more likely, b) he could tell she didn\u2019t care and it\u2019s only him that\u2019s bothered. And that\u2019s fine - establish boundaries. It might bother me too.

This was never mentioned in your post. Unless you consider the cuddling in bed part a form of cheating.
