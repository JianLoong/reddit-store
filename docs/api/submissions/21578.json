I just want to make that clear before people suggest I might be anything other than heterosexual. And obviously nothings wrong with being gay, but I\u2019m not.\n\nDespite this I haven\u2019t ever really been in a relationship or dated. I struggle a lot with women.  so it\u2019s not much a surprise to me, but it is to my family. My brothers both are in relationships. My oldest was already dating his wife when he was my age. My other older brother has never had issues finding women to like him. The difference is that I\u2019m a lot less physically attractive than they are and I\u2019m more introverted as a result of bullying throughout my entire life because of that. I have been told I\u2019m ugly throughout my entire life, even by random people in passing. I\u2019ve come to some level of peace with it so around \n\nMy family are constantly asking why I don\u2019t date and I always avoid just outright saying \u201cim ugly and girls don\u2019t like me\u201d.  One of the biggest suspicions they have about me is that I\u2019m gay. I don\u2019t know why but since I\u2019ve never dated in high school, that was always a question.\n\nI moved back in with my parents after graduating, I\u2019m planning on moving out soon, but my job in a different area isn\u2019t letting me start until November so I\u2019m working a different job until then and saving money. I haven\u2019t done much since graduation other than work and my parents are upset that I don\u2019t have a social life right now.\n\nSo my mom sat me down and tried to have a heart to heart with me about my situation. She told me that she feels like I\u2019m not making the most out of my life and said that she thinks that I\u2019m afraid to be myself around them and that\u2019s stifling my ability to live. She said that she really wants me to be happy and find friends and a partner. Then she said that it didn\u2019t matter which gender that the partner was as long as I was happy. \n\nThis came across as an accusation of me being gay. I asked what she meant by that and she said that she wants me to know that if I live a different lifestyle by myself i don\u2019t have to hide it and she\u2019d be happy as long as I brought someone home who I loved and who loved me. Again she\u2019s calling me gay. So I shut that down. \n\nI kinda snapped as I\u2019m so tired of it. I snapped at her that I\u2019m not gay and that I don\u2019t need her to monitor everything in my life. I said that it\u2019s none of her business why I\u2019m single, but if she really cares that much it\u2019s because I\u2019m too ugly for women to want to date me, and since there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it she needs to drop it.\n\nShe got very upset and apologized. That evening I got a call from my oldest brother demanding I apologize to my mom. He said she was trying to be supportive and I was a huge dick to her.

I get that you aren't feeling the accusation, but she's your mother, expressing concern and love for her child, saying she just wants you to be happy, also meaning as your mother, she knows you're unhappy. Yes, you owe her an apology for snapping at her, making her cry etc. You also need to get yourself into some sort of therapy to work on how you see yourself.

Look I get it, I didn't really date until I was 28 because I thought I was too ugly for girls/women to like. I imagine my family may have harbored thoughts that I was gay or at least anti-social. You don't bite the heads off those who love you when they express concern.

Im 31years old and my parents has never questioned me about dating or asked if I was gay because they don\u2019t see me dating .

Maybe what she did annoyed you, but that's more down to your own annoyance with yourself rather than what she did.\n\nI've been in a similar situation. Hadn't introduced a girl to my family once because I rarely had any relationships that lasted long enough to warrant introducing them, so from my family's point of view I was never involved with anyone. My mum invited me over one day, sat me down and told me how much she loved me and \"I'd love you if you were gay, too\". That was her way of trying to let me know that she would love me no matter what (my mum was born in the 50s and her generation aren't always the most accepting). I had a chuckle with her, let her know that I love her and really appreciate the sentiment. I also told her that I was straight and would introduce her to my next girlfriend.", "N T A\n\nWhen I was younger my family would insist, imply, infer, and damn near accuse me of being gay because I wasn't trying to f*ck everything in a skirt. \nIt gets frustrating trying to justify not doing what other expect regardless of the reasons. Your mother is terrible. She's not \"being supportive\". She's insistent that you pair up because it would make HER feel better about herself. You being single makes HER feel like a failure and she can't stand it so she hides behind fake encouragement.\n\nSorry you feel bad about your looks. You take the time you need to feel good about yourself before you put that on another person.\n\nBest wishes, buddy!", "Soft YTA. Sounds like your mom was genuinely concerned and was trying to provide a space where you could come out. While she was wrong, she is your mom and seems to love you. Sorry you are going through this.

Your mom was reaching out, out of concern for you. Instead of yelling at her, you could have just explained how you feel about your looks and that your history of being bullied has made you somewhat introverted and quiet. Or that you don't think your status as single should be a symptom of being unhappy or not being able to be who you are. Setting aside your sexual orientation specifically, there is nothing wrong with being gay, for anyone. And there is nothing wrong with telling a person that you love them no matter who they love.

Yet you're taking offense to any implication you are gay, instead of seeing what's really being conveyed: acceptance no matter what..\n\nInstead of snapping at her for the \"perceived insult of being called gay\", you could have more calmly explained your lack of self confidence.\n\nAlso, work on the whole \"gay is an insult\" mindset you have going on. \n\nI'd suggest a therapist, not for the whole \"gay thing\", but more for the self confidence issues you have.", "You\u2019re kind of the asshole, she was being supportive and I know that it can be annoying when people are so intense about something that isn\u2019t the reality but she meant well.\n\nI think you should talk to her and explain that you didn\u2019t meant to be rude but it\u2019s not nice to be called something that you aren\u2019t specifically if it\u2019s due to something that is hurtful. \n\nAs a girl, honestly most of us don\u2019t care about looks nowadays, you\u2019re damming yourself by thinking so much about it, maybe when you were in high school it was tough and girls were immature but if you have other strengths then looks don\u2019t mean anything. \n\nConfidence is key, try to work little by little on it and I say it as someone who is introverted too, it\u2019s difficult but the little things make a huge difference!", "YTA, your mom seems nice and supportive and you treated her like shit.", "YTA.

SHE is NOT insulting you, she is making sure you know SHE FUCKING LOVES YOU!!! You come off as homophobic dude and you need therapy, bad. You need to stop saying mean things to yourself.

But, then, as I continued to not bring a girl around or even talk about them, she kept asking, and it did become annoying (similar to when women get pissed at their mom about \"when are my grandbabies\").

It can be, but if it is you need to address it normally and not beat around the bush until someone explodes.\n\nEveryone is different and needs to deal with some things in their own way. I would not suggest that OP\u2019s mom was an asshole until I saw how they treated op before then. Actions speak louder than words sometimes, and that they did some wrong actions beforehand. Even the most heartfelt moments can be ruined by a bad action before hand, and if you think otherwise then you haven\u2019t experienced it yet, just wait.", "yeah having been there myself it\u2019s a weird mix of emotions. Not only is OP embarrassed and probably resentful of the fact that they can\u2019t find a partner, there\u2019s also this element of \u201cme being ugly and undateable is disappointing my mom\u201d", "feels like her whole speech was \u201cI don\u2019t care what gender they are, I just want you to have a partner\u201d when OP really needs to hear that he is enough and doesn\u2019t need a partner", "Exactly!!", "Or maybe he's sick of people assuming he's something he isn't?  If he has tried X amount to convince his mother of true fact Y **about himself** that she doesn't believe, it makes perfect sense to me that he would now try X+1.", "I don't know replace \"gay\" with anything else in this situation, and he'd probably try just as hard. People tend to overcompensate when they've had assumptions made about them, especially growing up or from parental figures.", "I am sorry but even if one has no problem with it one may have a problem of constantly being asked if one is gay. No need to accuse him of being a homophobe because of it. I think that there is nothing wrong with being a lawyer but if my family would be constantly asking me how my law degree is going I would snap as well at some point for them not accepting my answer that I don't have one.", "Lmao I completely agree - OP kept referring to it as an \u201caccusation\u201d\u2026 accusation is a term that refers to negative behaviors. OP needs to learn to use his words instead of biting the head off of people who actually walk the walk of support instead of just talking the talk, like he does.", "Who cares?", "It\u2019s because people have been suspecting that he\u2019s gay for years. It gets tiring especially when the reason they thing you\u2019re gay is because you\u2019ve never dated anyone. My mom constantly asked me if I was a lesbian because I never dated any boys in high school or for a good long while after and it got exhausting having to tell her that I wasn\u2019t a lesbian. I am bisexual, however, constantly being labeled as a potential lesbian, at some point, irritated me because of the frequency of the comment. I\u2019m not homophobic either just tired of people trying to label me as something that I\u2019m not when I\u2019ve stated something different many times before.", "She never accused OP or \"forced\" him to admit he was gay - she was concerned about her son's happiness, and she wanted to make it clear she was supportive of OP no matter his sexuality. OP is TA for snapping at her for no good reason", "Sometimes conversations like that can be difficult. Sometimes a bandaid just needs to be ripped off. Think about how this situation might have panned out if he was gay. That could have been the encouragement he needed to be true to himself.\n\nThe mom goes on about more than just his orientation and relationships. What she sees is a 22 year old who works, and then stays at home. The post also mentions her concern about his lack of friends and a social life at a time where most people (most, not all) are at their social peak. That can be a concerning sign and the mom was just trying to bring that all out in the open by having that conversation. If more parents checked in with their kids, we'd probably have a lot less issues.\n\nAs far as the \"why does he need a relationship to be happy?\" Thing, it's largely irrelevant to even discuss because it's not like OP is against a relationship, hell I'm almost willing to bet he'd be a lot happier if he could snap his fingers, make his self esteem issues disappear, and be with somebody. Humans are social creatures by nature and they want to be around people with similar interests, worldviews, etc. Not necessarily all the time, I genuinely love my alone time as well but anyone who says that they're \"happiest being 100% alone 100% of the time\" is lying. Besides, it's just a thing parents ask. Hell I'm 31, practically a forest dwelling hermit and my mom still asks me on a regular basis if I've started seeing someone. It's just what parents do. Those conversations can be tough but sometimes they need to happen. And look, now the mom is aware of the self esteem issues.", "The mom literally said \u201cidc the gender of the people you love, i will love you and want you to be your true self around me\u201d and you think shes in the wrong too?

She was trying to be supportive and let him know that it was okay IF he was gay.", "There was no accusation! She just told him that the most important thing for her was that he finds happiness in his life. That no matter what gender his partner is, she doesn't care as long as he's happy. She wanted to make sure he understood that under her roof, he would always be accepted.  \n\nThe only response to that is \"I love you too mom. Also, I'm not into guys, I just haven't met the right girl yet. But I appreciate knowing that you love and accept me for who I am\".", "> He's way too obsessed over being seen as gay to objectively understand.\n\nSince it sounds like this is a frequently-recurring thing, he's not the one obsessed, he's just frustrated.", "I don\u2019t consider what she said as an accusation of being gay. Nowadays people are more open about differing genders and lifestyles. He could date a a woman, man, a gender-fluid person or someone who identifies as neither gender.

Her whole \"I don't think you're making the most out of life\" comes off very differently to \"we love and support you regardless of who you date\". If she saw it as a mental health concern rather than a \"my son is abnormal\" concern, then she should address it as a mental health concern.\n\nPlus it hurts a lot to hear \"you'd be a lot happier with friends and a partner\" from your mum. No shit sherlock, of course he'd be happier in that situation, if it makes *you* that sad to see him in that situation, how do you think he feels?\n\nI don't think she had the wrong intentions, but I absolutely understand why OP snapped.

Maybe she should\u2019ve asked him what\u2019s going on I wanna be there for you and left it at that but she outright asked him if he was gay.", "The problem here its that its Op Family the ones that bullied him to have that mind set even maybe the mom allow it so i can completely understand why he snap at them after all that build up.\n\nYou don't get bullied for being ugly and them see that Ppls concerne with you being lonely as something rational like \"you told me i am ugly how do you want le to date?\" It is truly something to snap.", "at the same time if someone\u2019s been bullied and told they\u2019re ugly throughout their formative years, idk if the whole \u201cit\u2019s your fault because you don\u2019t love yourself\u201d thing is too fair", "I didn't see this as her making an assumption.

Just better to try to keep it in your head then say it aloud though. Just comes off as awkward and self-pitying. \n\nAlso, OP, as other said in this thread I see PLENTY of gorgeous women\nwith very ugly dudes. \n\nNo one\u2019s an asshole but I do think you should apologize for snapping at your mother. I know firsthand it\u2019s exhausting but I just try to find the humor in it. They\u2019ll find out you\u2019re not gay when you bring or a woman home for the holidays one day, or maybe they\u2019ll still think you are, idk. But it\u2019s just other peoples opinions it doesn\u2019t really matter, doesn\u2019t affect your reality. Your mother means well and is just trying to be supportive. Meddling in your personal life would be like setting you up with a neighborhood girl, sounds like she\u2019s just letting you know you have support if you need it. I\u2019ve received that talk like maybe 20 times by now and it\u2019s completely useless to me, but my actually gay friends with unsupportive parents think it\u2019s nice, so I just try to appreciate it!

Even with therapy and years of it may not even help but it\u2019s in the right direction It may take medication etc.. My point to all of that is that his mother missed The whole situation. Rather than going to the hole it\u2019s OK if you\u2019re gay thing she needed to take the route of I\u2019m concerned that you\u2019re turning into a hermit I\u2019m concerned that there\u2019s more going on and ask him if he wants to discuss it.", "Yeah like that\u2019s the vibe I got too.

He's NTA for firmly shutting it down.", "He says that he is being constantly asked why he isn't dating and that the main suspicion is that he is gay. Seems to me people try those nice conversations with him all the time and he is also tired of telling that he isn't gay. I think the family are AHs because they should just let him be instead of constantly asking and trying to help as well as suspecting him of being gay.

Take orientation out of it, and it's just family members who insist on bringing up topics you have clearly stated you don't want to discuss. It's insulting that she kept doing it and disregarded the person she claims she's trying to help.", "the unpleasant truth about this situation is that OP is, technically speaking, \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d, I know the term incel comes with a host of negative traits which I don\u2019t think OP has, but it\u2019s the classic tale of \u201cI would like to date women, but no women would like to date me\u201d.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re in that situation it\u2019s horrible to have people, parents especially, badger you about not dating.

The focus was on the romantic partner because she seems to think that being in the closet is causing social problems but I get the impression that the conversation wouldn\u2019t have happened (at least like that) if she thought that he was generally happy in his life.", "This is a very well-articulated point and I couldn't agree more. I actually received a very similar speech from my mom when I was *sixteen* and she thought it was more plausible that I was a lesbian and hiding a secret girlfriend from my family than that I was straight and just hadn't found the right guy yet. Of course it's a good thing that she was supportive and accepting and there are plenty of lgbt+ folks who don't get that from their parents, but it was *so uncomfortable* and she kept pushing the topic because she thought I was just being shy.\n\nIt does sound like OP was maybe a little aggressive in snapping back to his mom, there was a level on which she was well-intentioned and didn't deserve to be brought to tears over it. This is maybe in ESH territory for me. But there's an implicit \"something's wrong with you if you don't have a significant other yet\" inherent to that conversation, and I can't blame him for feeling put on the back foot because of it.", "I agree with you in general but I feel like OP is unhappy with not having a romantic partner and that may be what their mom is reacting to. \n\nThat being said, I totally empathize with the happily single people who are constantly questioned.", "Yup - that\u2019s amatonormativity, the assumption that everybody needs/wants/prioritises having a romantic/sexual partner to be happy. I still think OP is TA here, and I do still think his mum was well intentioned, but the social pressure to not be single isn\u2019t super helpful here.", "The mom wasn\u2019t telling him he is gay\u2026 she can see he is unhappy and thinks it would be better for him to have more of a social life (or that he might be hiding his social life from her, since she doesn\u2019t see him out having a social life)\u2026 There is a big difference between those 2 things", "Here, have some nuance.", "I think that\u2019s a very pushy reading of the situation. I agree that it\u2019d be frustrating if that\u2019s what they think the problem is, but OP is pretty clearly showing a situation where his mom just wants him to be happy above all.\n\nOP has decided he\u2019s ugly, he\u2019s introverted, and says his parents are concerned about his lack of a social life. I\u2019m not saying this man is an incel, but I do want to note the similarities in life? He sounds lonely and sad and I hope he\u2019s okay (and doesn\u2019t ACTUALLY fall down those creepy paths, because they prey on men who feel shit and it\u2019s wrong).\n\nI think, primarily, OP is frustrated and needs mental health support. And his mom has got the idea that maybe he\u2019s gay and that\u2019s why he\u2019s not branching out, which isn\u2019t correct. Defensiveness from a teenage boy, sadly, might\u2019ve looked like denial to her. The fundamental thing to take from that is that she seems to want a connection, or an explanation. She *wants* to understand and help her kid, who she can see isn\u2019t having a good time, but she can\u2019t work out why.\n\nEither way, it\u2019ll be more productive for OP to express to mom that you are thankful that she cares, but it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s due to other struggles. If OP confided that he struggles with confidence, he\u2019s faced bullying for his appearance, and he struggles with talking to girls because of it\u2026 he\u2019d be in a really good spot, because his mom CARES. \n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to spill, and it\u2019s bloody difficult. But if you sit in a depressed mindset unfortunately it\u2019s kind of pervasive. It never really ends until you make a conscious effort to try solutions to end it. And it\u2019s hard to get that energy, it really is - but a supportive family REALLY helps.\n\n@ OP - get yourself some mental health support! Your self esteem is down the drain, and it shouldn\u2019t be. Even if you\u2019re ugly there\u2019s women out there who don\u2019t give a damn. Perfect bodies, perfect chiselled faces\u2026 they\u2019re all crap if the personality is shite. Women like guys who make us laugh, show us they genuinely care, and have a bit of confidence and pride in themselves. \n\nBy that, I mean guys who *don\u2019t* constantly dwell on flaws and shortcomings, because negativity is negative!! Guys who can laugh at themselves when they look silly are great. Be a bit more positive and upbeat and you\u2019ll be more charismatic. And it doesn\u2019t matter if you look like you\u2019ve had your face punched in if you\u2019re the kind of person who people actually *like* spending time with.\n\nAnd by pride, I do mean pride in your appearance. You don\u2019t have to look like a male model - most women actually don\u2019t like that look anyway. We like men who like to look presentable, aka, not looking unkempt. \n\nShower regularly, use antiperspirant deodorants and maybe cologne if you like one. Make sure your hair is clean and presentable, same with your nails. Wash your face with an actual face wash! And wear clothes that are clean and \u201cnice\u201d when you go out - you don\u2019t need fancy shirts or anything, hoodies are fine, but like\u2026 ones that don\u2019t have spills or holes lmfao.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re actually a dirty person. But it\u2019s the little things that make a difference so I\u2019m just covering it all.  \n\nFinally, be nice! Some people who struggle mentally don\u2019t realise that they\u2019re kind of mean to other people. It\u2019s normally by accident because they are hurting and just want to express it - they\u2019ve been upset or are having a bad time, so\u2026 everyone\u2019s gotta know. But when people haven\u2019t done anything to hurt you, that puts people off. A fresh start away from the people who treated you like crap will be great, but try not to carry that baggage into future conversations. You know how nice you feel when a stranger does something kind for you? Try to be that guy. \n\nIt actually made such a difference to my life when I started *trying* to be nice and happy. I became a bit annoying, probably - but if I had a nice thought I\u2019d say it. A lady on the street had a nice jacket so I said that colour was lovely - and she thanked me and smiled, and it felt GREAT. It\u2019s the little things. \n\nI know this sounds stupid and obnoxious, teenage me would\u2019ve died inside, but it really, really makes a difference trying to be positive. (and anyone who reacts badly to a genuine respectful compliment sucks anyway, and that\u2019s reflective of THEM, not you.)\n\nAnyway. That\u2019s enough from me. And it\u2019s off topic. But I hope it helps a little.", "well it\u2019s not like she said \u201ci know you\u2019re gay you don\u2019t have to hide it\u201d she basically said \u201ci will always love you no matter if you\u2019re gay or straight or whatever and i want you to feel comfortable with talking to me\u201d. that\u2019s an appropriate thing to say to anyone.", "That's not what happened here anyways", "I think that\u2019s how he heard it because of the previous bullying.

Even as his mother. You just don\u2019t come out and accuse someone of being gay and telling him that you love them either way.\n\nThat would piss me off. I agree he shouldn\u2019t of snapped at her but I think they both need to sit down and calmly discuss all of this. She should\u2019ve been there to to try and find out where his depression is coming from. The I\u2019m ugly part is just denying he has depression and blaming it on physical appearance. There are some really ugly people that have been in happy relationships. And just because you\u2019re not in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad thing either.\n\nThere\u2019s more going on here with him. He needs therapy and his mother should be helping him in that direction of trying to make His self-esteem better. That would be the best thing she could do. But when someone has depression issues sometimes the best of intentions make it worse", ">There was no accusation!\n\nUse context clues please. OP states they have had this suspicion since high-school. You really think this is the first time she has brought it up? You're acting like it was a one off comment but OP probably has heard remarks about his orientation for years.", "The problem here is what\u2019s lying beneath all of this. He\u2019s depressed he needs help with that the low self-esteem is just a symptom.\n\nYou don\u2019t come to somebody and say well I love you and if you love whoever guys or girls I love you anyway that is accusing him of being gay. Again there\u2019s nothing wrong with that but why do you say that to somebody?\n\nIf she really cared about him she should\u2019ve asked him what\u2019s going on? She should\u2019ve said well I know you haven\u2019t been happy and I would really like to help you with that. I would be willing to go to therapy with you if that would help you or if you\u2019d rather go alone I would support that. You just don\u2019t have this kind of conversation with somebody who\u2019s depressed and just feel hurt because they\u2019re upset.

He\u2019s an adult he\u2019s been going through this all his life but unfortunately people brush it off to  hormones and just overlook the behavior.\n\nI always stayed out of my children\u2019s love life. However, I was supportive of their choices and let them figure it out on their own. I have also told my children that I would be there for them no matter what.  but I never ever said to them it\u2019s OK to be gay I love you anyway the heck who says that.\n\nHe needs to be steered toward some type of therapy that\u2019s where she needs to be involved if he wants her to. I would hope that they would be able to work this out, but just saying well if you\u2019re gay that\u2019s OK because you don\u2019t have any friends or you don\u2019t have a relationship thats no way to go about helping him.", "No they've asked if he's dating, but haven't asked if he was gay.

It just makes you feel worse.", "Again, you're missing the point where her conversation was about more than just romantic relationships. It also included his lack of friends and lack of a social life in general. Even a \"severe introvert\" such as yourself has friends and you use things like reddit and likely other online platforms to interact with people. Online interactions are still interactions. If someone was perfectly happy being 100% alone, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Romantic relationships aren't the focus here although OP hasn't said that he doesn't want a relationship, I'd say he even implies quite the opposite.\n\nThe mom likely didn't know about the self esteem issues because OP likely kept them hidden when he lived at home and then he went off to college. I'll use myself as an example again: I'm 31 and my mom didn't know about my depression until last year when she sat me down and asked me what was going on with me. I had been struggling with it alone for damn near 20 years at that point because I chose to mask up as best I could to keep it hidden. She finally caught on and asked me about it when due to life circumstances I had to move back home for a few months. In that time I didn't go anywhere and my drinking skyrocketed. She caught a whiff that something was wrong and chose to open that dialogue. Again, it sounds like the focal point of the moms conversation here was her concern about his lack of social nourishment in general and then tacked on the relationship/orientation piece as well. Would we have rathered the mom show absolutely no concern?", "She didn\u2019t deserve to be yelled at like shes talking to a teenager\u2026 thats probably why OP cant get a gf and claims he is a \u201cnice guy\u201d \n\nI can understand being annoyed with the fact that everyone in your family thinks you\u2019re gay when you arent.. but the way he phrases it sounds like he has some homophobic thoughts as he phrases this \u201ci will love you no matter the gender\u201d as an \u201caccusation\u201d. If he had communicated with his mom about his feelings more (which seems like something he very well can do based off the conversation/she is open minded and just wants to figure out why her son is so secluded/unhappy) then them thinking he could be gay for 8 years wouldn\u2019t have even happy. OP needs a therapist", "Did you miss the part where his mom already apologized?", ">One of the biggest suspicions they have about me is that I\u2019m gay. I don\u2019t know why but since I\u2019ve never dated in high school, that was always a question.\n\nHe doesn't say \"I think they think I'm gay,\" there's no uncertainty here. Do you think he's lying?", "Absolutely. An example I can give from my personal life is that I was going through a difficult time in my early 20s. I wasn't seeking any mental health support for it, even though it probably would've been helpful.\n\nMy Dad noticed something wasn't quite right, but coming from a time and culture that didn't really deal with mental health, approached a valid concern in the wrong way, making things worse. What he said to me was \"you've been really irritable to us recently, I think you should try cognitive behavioural therapy\". Because I already wasn't feeling good, what I heard was \"you're being overly emotional and annoying, go to therapy to fix yourself so you're more palatable to us\", even though that wasn't what he was saying. A slightly different approach and the message can come out much more positively.", "Agreed. I have a (manipulative, controlling) family member who has made this assumption about me, despite being told multiple times by myself and other family members that I\u2019m not a lesbian. It\u2019s a weird af hill to die on, especially when the motivating factor for this belief is \u201cwell you\u2019ve been single for so long\u201d (even though I haven\u2019t been for two years; she apparently dropped it when someone let it slip recently - I\u2019m no contact with her now). And it\u2019s even worse for me because this IS something I\u2019ve been exploring the last five or so years, and having it pressed constantly (directly or indirectly) is really invasive and distressing, especially considering I\u2019m not in a rush to label myself (or come out).", "Yeah we had a guy in our friend group that didn\u2019t have a relationship even after the age of 25. We never asked him about it that was his business. We did sometimes amongst ourselves when he wasn\u2019t there kind of questioned it but it was not a big deal so it never went anywhere.\n\nAt the age of 30 he did have a couple of relationships and was even engaged once but come to find out it wasn\u2019t because he was gay he was just an idiot. We still care about him we\u2019re still friends with him and just accept him the way he is.", "If my mother saw me struggling and \"took me to get a haircut\" instead of having a heart to heart talk with me where she told me that she would love me no matter what. I would have never come out to her and other family.\n\nThe fix to low self esteem is not to buy things, its to talk about the problem and learn how to over come it. Buying things to cover it up is just pushing it to the side and not fixing the problem, it will still be there eating at you that the haircut didn't look as good as you hoped, or you think it would look better on someone else.\n\nAs a parent she is looking out for him, she lives with him and can probably see him hurting, and she is trying to understand why. I think youre wrong that most people won't like this. Almost every single lgbt person would love this, and thats the point. She doesn't know why her son is feeling this way, and she just wants to show that she loves him as her son and nothing can change that.\n\nETA: If on the off chance her son was actually gay this talk is incredibly helpful, if he reacts in a way that is less defensive and more open to talk about his emotions its also incredibly helpful. Yelling at someone who is concerned and wanting to help is the opposite of helpful", "You and I will just have to disagree on this. It didn't come across to me like the mother was pushing, just worried. And if she did think he was gay, why is that a bad thing? I still say OP is TAH.", "Im referring to your comment that being gay is some sort of ideology that one pushes.", "Yep, this has def happened to us! It was actually his *family* who said it!\n\nOnce, we were at a bowling alley and I thought it was obvious we were together. This guy walked up to me, in front of my then-bf, and said you are absolutely gorgeous and proceeded to try to chat me up. I was flabbergasted. I forget what my bf said, but he sort of jokingly said, I know right, I have good taste. We all laughed it off but I thought it was really rude.", "YTA\n\nApologise to your mom for snapping at her, thank her for her concern but your issue is not \"being gay\".\n\nFind a counselor to help you work on your self esteem.

I loved that the Jane Fonda character was so upfront about the work she has had done, much like the actress herself.", "Lmao gratis. I've been calling him that for 5 years now", "Because being non-confrontational and avoiding the uncomfortable conversation worked so well the many times he did it in the past. He pretty clearly didn't want to talk to his family about it, thus the intervention style sit down (she knew she was pressing). \n\nHe could have handled it *better*, sure. I don't see him as an AH for expressing frustration and he didn't actually explode or curse or anything like that. Just shut it down firmly.", "I\u2019m aromantic myself and amatonormativity really grinds my gears. But it\u2019s not really a well known concept, and I don\u2019t blame OPs mum for not being aware of it, so I don\u2019t consider her an AH at all. She was still trying to be supportive. From what OP described, she didn\u2019t put direct pressure on him to get a partner, although her phrasing reflects amatonormative social standards.", "It was his mother that was more concerned about his lack of a relationship than his depression.\n\nI hate when people assume because I\u2019m still single after my divorce that there\u2019s something wrong with me. Quite the opposite actually I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship I hated it. I do have some close friends and that\u2019s the way I want to keep it.\n\nBut the way she went about it and especially when a person is severely depressed Only makes it worse. He has very low self-esteem and that is something he should be working on and she should be helping him towards that. Nobody should care if somebody\u2019s in a relationship or not I know it\u2019s very irritating when they try and push you into one. My friend is always trying to say oh well you should go out with this guy or that guy I don\u2019t want to I\u2019m perfectly happy with the way my life is now.\n\nBeing gay or not is not the issue here. As his mother she should be looking at why he is so depressed why doesn\u2019t he feel that he is feeling better about himself and that should be the focus not whether or not he should have a relationship", "Then why accuse them of being gay? She could\u2019ve just said look I see you\u2019re unhappy, I wish there was something I could do to help you. She didn\u2019t have to go into all the other stuff. He probably has been depressed all his life and he does need therapy. I know people say that all the time but at some point we all need therapy whether we accept that or not is another story.\n\nShe was concerned enough to notice he didn\u2019t have any friends or a relationship that it bothered her enough to question his orientation. But she did say it with \u201clove\u201d although I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t come across to him as that.\n\nThat should never be brought up in any conversation like this unless he brings it up. All she had to say was you seem unhappy to me. Would you like to discuss it. You don\u2019t go into the whole thing with the lack of friends and relationships. Depression is the real problem here and she obviously has never picked up on it. And saying things like that to him will make him shut up and will make him not want to discuss anything.\n\nAnd I still feel they both need to apologize. He for snapping at her and she for making assumptions. If they can sit down and calmly discuss her concerns and his feelings that would be the best thing to do. She really needs to find out if there\u2019s anything she can do to help him through his depression. Offer to pay for therapy, offer to go to therapy with him, offer to support him.\n\nYou just don\u2019t snap out of depression when somebody tells you to.  She also needs to understand his feelings. This is what they should be discussing. Why does he think he\u2019s \u201cugly\u201d? Is there anything she can do to help him with this. This is what they should be discussing not his relationships.", "Agree with the therapy part. This is all stemming from Severe depression therapy and maybe the medication would be an immense help but not helping him through this and just saying while you\u2019re not in a relationship so there\u2019s something wrong with you it\u2019s not something a mother should say", "Yes", "He also doesn't say \"they've asked if I'm gay.\" The only time we know it's been mentioned is during the convo with his mom. When he asked her to clarify what she meant by wanting him to be happy.", "That is true and I apologize for that that\u2019s not what I meant but I\u2019m sure it came across that way. I understand that being gay it\u2019s not a choice it\u2019s the way you are And nothing wrong with that we all are what we are.", "It is SO rude! Like... excuse you? You just insulted the man I love, to his face. In what world is that flattering to anyone?", "There are some men who are only interested in a woman who is already happy with someone else.  Like the \"contest\" to \"win\" her is what they actually enjoy.", "Why did you reply to a random commenter? \ud83d\ude02", "So im not basing the ESH just on the moment itself. If it was just the moment then OP is the obvious asshole here. But OP gave us some background beforehand and judging by the background OP\u2019s family didn\u2019t make him feel ok at all. OP needed reassurance back then and instead they talked amongst themselves and didn\u2019t say anything. There\u2019s such a thing as saying the right thing too late. The mom could have said this a long time ago when he was still suffering, but chose this moment when things relatively calmed down to address it.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that OP is suffering from depression from the bullying he received and never got help for, and it also developed a form of anxiety since his entire image of himself is destroyed. It\u2019s something that OP needs to address and for his parents to finally realize and help him out. It\u2019s clear that they compare him to his other brothers and are worried that he isn\u2019t anything like them. But he doesn\u2019t need to be like them, he just needs to be a better him.\n\nThat\u2019s why I say ESH because his family didn\u2019t make him feel at all like he was worth anything until it was too late. Their negative actions and treating him like something was wrong, even IF unintentional, is what led to the heartfelt moment being ruined. That\u2019s why I say ESH.", "Reread the post. Mom is concerned about him feeling free to be himself. About him having a social life (not just a romantic partner). About him getting the most out of life. That\u2019s exactly how a conversation about depression goes. She is concerned about his happiness. She may have guessed incorrectly about what\u2019s causing it, but she\u2019s opening a dialogue about what is making him unhappy.\n\nIf OP hadn\u2019t overreacted to the suggestion that he could be gay, maybe they could have gotten to the actual root of the problem: his trauma from bullying, his self esteem issues, his feeling that he\u2019s behind where his brothers were at his age.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your pushy friends, but stop projecting your experience onto OP. It\u2019s not the same. You can talk about depression without saying the magic word.", "She didn't accuse him of being gay. She just said that she hopes he finds friends and someone to be happy with, regardless of their gender. That's not an accusation. OP took it as such. \n\nA lot of what you're saying is kinda irrelevant to what actually happened. She tried to have a conversation, he immediately got defensive, flipped out on her and then stormed off. How was she supposed to get to the root of anything after that? I'm sure she would have tried to seek out the root causes of his self esteem and possible depression but he didn't give her that opportunity. That door isn't closed but OP is definitely in the wrong here for flipping out on someone who was concerned and trying to help. Also, I'm not sure why you mentioned the \"you don't just snap out of depression\" bit because the post makes literally no mention of his mom saying anything remotely close to that.\n\nAt the end of the day, mom was trying to help and being a concerned parent, OP bit her head off and then stormed off instead of actually having a conversation. He's TA and he should apologize. Maybe he'll recognize how lucky he is to have a parent that actually gives a shit.", "She literally didnt say that. She was worried he was hiding his life from her out of fear (being gay is kinda a sign in most places to get beat up/bullied etc unfortunately) \n\nI know all about depression and this really doesnt sound like major depressive disorder (im diagnosed). Thats just my input. Therapy would help with whatever is going on in his head.. if he allows the help.", "Ew! What an ugly goal!", "I feel there was no reason to bring any of that up. She can be concerned but my feeling is that it could\u2019ve gone better on both sides. He obviously is very sensitive about all of this. They both could\u2019ve done it better and hopefully they can move forward and have calm Heartful discussions.\n\nHe needs help with his self-esteem. He needs therapy to go through why he feels this way. Anyone who is in a deep depression is not going to have these kinds of discussions with almost anyone. My feeling is she should\u2019ve picked up on this a while back if she\u2019s so concerned about him not having a social life.\n\nI can see where he got upset about the conversation she should\u2019ve just left out all the orientation stuff And just said you know I\u2019m just concerned that you seem to be shutting yourself out. Is there something I can help you with, do you want to discuss it, etc.\n\nHe needs therapy and maybe medication but just coming out and saying well you\u2019re being a loner I\u2019m concerned about you are you gay blah blah blah no should never happen"]}
