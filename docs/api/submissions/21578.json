I just want to make that clear before people suggest I might be anything other than heterosexual. And obviously nothings wrong with being gay, but I\u2019m not.\n\nDespite this I haven\u2019t ever really been in a relationship or dated. I struggle a lot with women.  so it\u2019s not much a surprise to me, but it is to my family. My brothers both are in relationships. My oldest was already dating his wife when he was my age. My other older brother has never had issues finding women to like him. The difference is that I\u2019m a lot less physically attractive than they are and I\u2019m more introverted as a result of bullying throughout my entire life because of that. I have been told I\u2019m ugly throughout my entire life, even by random people in passing. I\u2019ve come to some level of peace with it so around \n\nMy family are constantly asking why I don\u2019t date and I always avoid just outright saying \u201cim ugly and girls don\u2019t like me\u201d.  One of the biggest suspicions they have about me is that I\u2019m gay. I don\u2019t know why but since I\u2019ve never dated in high school, that was always a question.\n\nI moved back in with my parents after graduating, I\u2019m planning on moving out soon, but my job in a different area isn\u2019t letting me start until November so I\u2019m working a different job until then and saving money. I haven\u2019t done much since graduation other than work and my parents are upset that I don\u2019t have a social life right now.\n\nSo my mom sat me down and tried to have a heart to heart with me about my situation. She told me that she feels like I\u2019m not making the most out of my life and said that she thinks that I\u2019m afraid to be myself around them and that\u2019s stifling my ability to live. She said that she really wants me to be happy and find friends and a partner. Then she said that it didn\u2019t matter which gender that the partner was as long as I was happy. \n\nThis came across as an accusation of me being gay. I asked what she meant by that and she said that she wants me to know that if I live a different lifestyle by myself i don\u2019t have to hide it and she\u2019d be happy as long as I brought someone home who I loved and who loved me. Again she\u2019s calling me gay. So I shut that down. \n\nI kinda snapped as I\u2019m so tired of it. I snapped at her that I\u2019m not gay and that I don\u2019t need her to monitor everything in my life. I said that it\u2019s none of her business why I\u2019m single, but if she really cares that much it\u2019s because I\u2019m too ugly for women to want to date me, and since there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it she needs to drop it.\n\nShe got very upset and apologized. That evening I got a call from my oldest brother demanding I apologize to my mom. He said she was trying to be supportive and I was a huge dick to her.

If it was your friends asking if you were gay for the millionth time in a dumbass way, snapping would be more appropriate. Your mom was just being your mom. Good parents are often worried that their children aren't happy in life so it sounds like she was doing a wellness check while also throwing it out there that if you were gay, she'd be supportive and you'd still be her son. Apologize to her. Explain why you got so heated about it and that it wasn't because of her.", "NAH. Sounds like a normal interaction to me. Normal as in, a normal tough conversation between parent and child. She was trying to be supportive but kept pushing something that bothered you, and you snapped at her about backing off. It happens. No one did anything extreme. An apology for snapping sounds appropriate but that\u2019s about all that seems necessary.

Ugly people date all the time. Honestly, it's more likely your attitude that puts women off. I wouldn't want to date someone as volatile as you and getting mad at someone for trying to be welcoming and encouraging. My husband would say he isn't handsome, but I disagree!! Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but besides that, my husband is kind, caring, funny, and would absolutely NOT snap at someone who was showing concern and acceptance.

I get that you aren't feeling the accusation, but she's your mother, expressing concern and love for her child, saying she just wants you to be happy, also meaning as your mother, she knows you're unhappy. Yes, you owe her an apology for snapping at her, making her cry etc. You also need to get yourself into some sort of therapy to work on how you see yourself.  Beauty is subjective, you put yourself down wayyy too much and that too can be creating your own self sabotage for a relationship.

Your mother was expressing concern for you and tried to be supportive in case you felt like you couldn't be yourself (ie gay). She was mistaken in her assumption but the thought is what counts here. Look I get it, I didn't really date until I was 28 because I thought I was too ugly for girls/women to like. I imagine my family may have harbored thoughts that I was gay or at least anti-social. You don't bite the heads off those who love you when they express concern. You could have calmly stated you weren't gay, but rather suffering from low self esteem or even just \"I haven't found the right person\".

It was wrong to snap at her even though she was trying to hurt you. You should really go to her and apologize. \n\nYour family (or only mom) only wants to help you, but I also believe it is wrong to assume things based on speculation. The way you explain it sounds like she sincerely believes you are gay. \n\nBut I have faith in all of you since you all seem to be caring and want each other\u2018s happiness. You would all go a long way of talking to esch other and explain things. Without snapping at each other", "Honestly I don\u2019t blame you for snapping . This narrative that people run with thinking that someone must be gay just because they don\u2019t see them out with women is tiring asf .just because someone doesn\u2019t date does not mean they\u2019re gay . Im 31years old and my parents has never questioned me about dating or asked if I was gay because they don\u2019t see me dating . They don\u2019t ask because they know it\u2019s not any of their business and if I wanted them to know I would tell them.

Maybe what she did annoyed you, but that's more down to your own annoyance with yourself rather than what she did.\n\nI've been in a similar situation. Hadn't introduced a girl to my family once because I rarely had any relationships that lasted long enough to warrant introducing them, so from my family's point of view I was never involved with anyone. My mum invited me over one day, sat me down and told me how much she loved me and \"I'd love you if you were gay, too\". That was her way of trying to let me know that she would love me no matter what (my mum was born in the 50s and her generation aren't always the most accepting). I had a chuckle with her, let her know that I love her and really appreciate the sentiment. I also told her that I was straight and would introduce her to my next girlfriend.", "N T A\n\nWhen I was younger my family would insist, imply, infer, and damn near accuse me of being gay because I wasn't trying to f*ck everything in a skirt. \nIt gets frustrating trying to justify not doing what other expect regardless of the reasons. Your mother is terrible. She's not \"being supportive\". She's insistent that you pair up because it would make HER feel better about herself. You being single makes HER feel like a failure and she can't stand it so she hides behind fake encouragement.\n\nSorry you feel bad about your looks. You take the time you need to feel good about yourself before you put that on another person.\n\nBest wishes, buddy!", "Soft YTA. Sounds like your mom was genuinely concerned and was trying to provide a space where you could come out. While she was wrong, she is your mom and seems to love you. Sorry you are going through this.

Setting aside your sexual orientation specifically, there is nothing wrong with being gay, for anyone. And there is nothing wrong with telling a person that you love them no matter who they love.

Not only is OP embarrassed and probably resentful of the fact that they can\u2019t find a partner, there\u2019s also this element of \u201cme being ugly and undateable is disappointing my mom\u201d", "feels like her whole speech was \u201cI don\u2019t care what gender they are, I just want you to have a partner\u201d when OP really needs to hear that he is enough and doesn\u2019t need a partner", "Exactly!!", "Or maybe he's sick of people assuming he's something he isn't?

People tend to overcompensate when they've had assumptions made about them, especially growing up or from parental figures.", "I am sorry but even if one has no problem with it one may have a problem of constantly being asked if one is gay. No need to accuse him of being a homophobe because of it.

It gets tiring especially when the reason they thing you\u2019re gay is because you\u2019ve never dated anyone. My mom constantly asked me if I was a lesbian because I never dated any boys in high school or for a good long while after and it got exhausting having to tell her that I wasn\u2019t a lesbian. I am bisexual, however, constantly being labeled as a potential lesbian, at some point, irritated me because of the frequency of the comment. I\u2019m not homophobic either just tired of people trying to label me as something that I\u2019m not when I\u2019ve stated something different many times before.", "She never accused OP or \"forced\" him to admit he was gay - she was concerned about her son's happiness, and she wanted to make it clear she was supportive of OP no matter his sexuality.

Think about how this situation might have panned out if he was gay. That could have been the encouragement he needed to be true to himself.\n\nThe mom goes on about more than just his orientation and relationships. What she sees is a 22 year old who works, and then stays at home. The post also mentions her concern about his lack of friends and a social life at a time where most people (most, not all) are at their social peak. That can be a concerning sign and the mom was just trying to bring that all out in the open by having that conversation. If more parents checked in with their kids, we'd probably have a lot less issues.\n\nAs far as the \"why does he need a relationship to be happy?\" Thing, it's largely irrelevant to even discuss because it's not like OP is against a relationship, hell I'm almost willing to bet he'd be a lot happier if he could snap his fingers, make his self esteem issues disappear, and be with somebody. Humans are social creatures by nature and they want to be around people with similar interests, worldviews, etc. Not necessarily all the time, I genuinely love my alone time as well but anyone who says that they're \"happiest being 100% alone 100% of the time\" is lying. Besides, it's just a thing parents ask. Hell I'm 31, practically a forest dwelling hermit and my mom still asks me on a regular basis if I've started seeing someone. It's just what parents do. Those conversations can be tough but sometimes they need to happen.

Nowadays people are more open about differing genders and lifestyles. He could date a a woman, man, a gender-fluid person or someone who identifies as neither gender.

Her whole \"I don't think you're making the most out of life\" comes off very differently to \"we love and support you regardless of who you date\". If she saw it as a mental health concern rather than a \"my son is abnormal\" concern, then she should address it as a mental health concern.\n\nPlus it hurts a lot to hear \"you'd be a lot happier with friends and a partner\" from your mum. No shit sherlock, of course he'd be happier in that situation, if it makes *you* that sad to see him in that situation, how do you think he feels?\n\nI don't think she had the wrong intentions, but I absolutely understand why OP snapped.

Just better to try to keep it in your head then say it aloud though. Just comes off as awkward and self-pitying. \n\nAlso, OP, as other said in this thread I see PLENTY of gorgeous women\nwith very ugly dudes. \n\nNo one\u2019s an asshole but I do think you should apologize for snapping at your mother. I know firsthand it\u2019s exhausting but I just try to find the humor in it. They\u2019ll find out you\u2019re not gay when you bring or a woman home for the holidays one day, or maybe they\u2019ll still think you are, idk. But it\u2019s just other peoples opinions it doesn\u2019t really matter, doesn\u2019t affect your reality. Your mother means well and is just trying to be supportive. Meddling in your personal life would be like setting you up with a neighborhood girl, sounds like she\u2019s just letting you know you have support if you need it. I\u2019ve received that talk like maybe 20 times by now and it\u2019s completely useless to me, but my actually gay friends with unsupportive parents think it\u2019s nice, so I just try to appreciate it!

Even with therapy and years of it may not even help but it\u2019s in the right direction It may take medication etc.. My point to all of that is that his mother missed The whole situation. Rather than going to the hole it\u2019s OK if you\u2019re gay thing she needed to take the route of I\u2019m concerned that you\u2019re turning into a hermit I\u2019m concerned that there\u2019s more going on and ask him if he wants to discuss it.", "Yeah like that\u2019s the vibe I got too.

He's NTA for firmly shutting it down.", "He says that he is being constantly asked why he isn't dating and that the main suspicion is that he is gay. Seems to me people try those nice conversations with him all the time and he is also tired of telling that he isn't gay. I think the family are AHs because they should just let him be instead of constantly asking and trying to help as well as suspecting him of being gay.

Take orientation out of it, and it's just family members who insist on bringing up topics you have clearly stated you don't want to discuss. It's insulting that she kept doing it and disregarded the person she claims she's trying to help.", "the unpleasant truth about this situation is that OP is, technically speaking, \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d, I know the term incel comes with a host of negative traits which I don\u2019t think OP has, but it\u2019s the classic tale of \u201cI would like to date women, but no women would like to date me\u201d.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re in that situation it\u2019s horrible to have people, parents especially, badger you about not dating.

The focus was on the romantic partner because she seems to think that being in the closet is causing social problems but I get the impression that the conversation wouldn\u2019t have happened (at least like that) if she thought that he was generally happy in his life.", "This is a very well-articulated point and I couldn't agree more. I actually received a very similar speech from my mom when I was *sixteen* and she thought it was more plausible that I was a lesbian and hiding a secret girlfriend from my family than that I was straight and just hadn't found the right guy yet. Of course it's a good thing that she was supportive and accepting and there are plenty of lgbt+ folks who don't get that from their parents, but it was *so uncomfortable* and she kept pushing the topic because she thought I was just being shy.\n\nIt does sound like OP was maybe a little aggressive in snapping back to his mom, there was a level on which she was well-intentioned and didn't deserve to be brought to tears over it. This is maybe in ESH territory for me. But there's an implicit \"something's wrong with you if you don't have a significant other yet\" inherent to that conversation, and I can't blame him for feeling put on the back foot because of it.", "I agree with you in general but I feel like OP is unhappy with not having a romantic partner and that may be what their mom is reacting to. \n\nThat being said, I totally empathize with the happily single people who are constantly questioned.", "Yup - that\u2019s amatonormativity, the assumption that everybody needs/wants/prioritises having a romantic/sexual partner to be happy. I still think OP is TA here, and I do still think his mum was well intentioned, but the social pressure to not be single isn\u2019t super helpful here.", "The mom wasn\u2019t telling him he is gay\u2026 she can see he is unhappy and thinks it would be better for him to have more of a social life (or that he might be hiding his social life from her, since she doesn\u2019t see him out having a social life)\u2026 There is a big difference between those 2 things", "Here, have some nuance.", "I think that\u2019s a very pushy reading of the situation. I agree that it\u2019d be frustrating if that\u2019s what they think the problem is, but OP is pretty clearly showing a situation where his mom just wants him to be happy above all.\n\nOP has decided he\u2019s ugly, he\u2019s introverted, and says his parents are concerned about his lack of a social life. I\u2019m not saying this man is an incel, but I do want to note the similarities in life? He sounds lonely and sad and I hope he\u2019s okay (and doesn\u2019t ACTUALLY fall down those creepy paths, because they prey on men who feel shit and it\u2019s wrong).\n\nI think, primarily, OP is frustrated and needs mental health support. And his mom has got the idea that maybe he\u2019s gay and that\u2019s why he\u2019s not branching out, which isn\u2019t correct. Defensiveness from a teenage boy, sadly, might\u2019ve looked like denial to her. The fundamental thing to take from that is that she seems to want a connection, or an explanation. She *wants* to understand and help her kid, who she can see isn\u2019t having a good time, but she can\u2019t work out why.\n\nEither way, it\u2019ll be more productive for OP to express to mom that you are thankful that she cares, but it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s due to other struggles. If OP confided that he struggles with confidence, he\u2019s faced bullying for his appearance, and he struggles with talking to girls because of it\u2026 he\u2019d be in a really good spot, because his mom CARES. \n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to spill, and it\u2019s bloody difficult. But if you sit in a depressed mindset unfortunately it\u2019s kind of pervasive. It never really ends until you make a conscious effort to try solutions to end it. And it\u2019s hard to get that energy, it really is - but a supportive family REALLY helps.\n\n@ OP - get yourself some mental health support! Your self esteem is down the drain, and it shouldn\u2019t be. Even if you\u2019re ugly there\u2019s women out there who don\u2019t give a damn. Perfect bodies, perfect chiselled faces\u2026 they\u2019re all crap if the personality is shite. Women like guys who make us laugh, show us they genuinely care, and have a bit of confidence and pride in themselves. \n\nBy that, I mean guys who *don\u2019t* constantly dwell on flaws and shortcomings, because negativity is negative!! Guys who can laugh at themselves when they look silly are great. Be a bit more positive and upbeat and you\u2019ll be more charismatic. And it doesn\u2019t matter if you look like you\u2019ve had your face punched in if you\u2019re the kind of person who people actually *like* spending time with.\n\nAnd by pride, I do mean pride in your appearance. You don\u2019t have to look like a male model - most women actually don\u2019t like that look anyway. We like men who like to look presentable, aka, not looking unkempt. \n\nShower regularly, use antiperspirant deodorants and maybe cologne if you like one. Make sure your hair is clean and presentable, same with your nails. Wash your face with an actual face wash! And wear clothes that are clean and \u201cnice\u201d when you go out - you don\u2019t need fancy shirts or anything, hoodies are fine, but like\u2026 ones that don\u2019t have spills or holes lmfao.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re actually a dirty person. But it\u2019s the little things that make a difference so I\u2019m just covering it all.  \n\nFinally, be nice! Some people who struggle mentally don\u2019t realise that they\u2019re kind of mean to other people. It\u2019s normally by accident because they are hurting and just want to express it - they\u2019ve been upset or are having a bad time, so\u2026 everyone\u2019s gotta know. But when people haven\u2019t done anything to hurt you, that puts people off. A fresh start away from the people who treated you like crap will be great, but try not to carry that baggage into future conversations. You know how nice you feel when a stranger does something kind for you? Try to be that guy. \n\nIt actually made such a difference to my life when I started *trying* to be nice and happy. I became a bit annoying, probably - but if I had a nice thought I\u2019d say it. A lady on the street had a nice jacket so I said that colour was lovely - and she thanked me and smiled, and it felt GREAT. It\u2019s the little things. \n\nI know this sounds stupid and obnoxious, teenage me would\u2019ve died inside, but it really, really makes a difference trying to be positive. (and anyone who reacts badly to a genuine respectful compliment sucks anyway, and that\u2019s reflective of THEM, not you.)\n\nAnyway. That\u2019s enough from me. And it\u2019s off topic. But I hope it helps a little.", "well it\u2019s not like she said \u201ci know you\u2019re gay you don\u2019t have to hide it\u201d she basically said \u201ci will always love you no matter if you\u2019re gay or straight or whatever and i want you to feel comfortable with talking to me\u201d. that\u2019s an appropriate thing to say to anyone.", "That's not what happened here anyways", "I think that\u2019s how he heard it because of the previous bullying.

She did accuse him of being gay. You can add I love you whatever but that is how it comes across. And I\u2019m not saying that being gay is a problem.\n\nHe has a very bad depression problem and if she hasn\u2019t figured that out by now then she doesn\u2019t know him at all. He has all the signs of depression. Self-esteem especially low self-esteem is a symptom of depression. \n\nYou also don\u2019t need to be in a relationship to be happy.

They both need to calmly sit down and express their feelings and she needs to listen to his too. \n\nShe also needs to say that she supports him if he wants to go to therapy. She wants to help him through this depression. You just don\u2019t go around saying oh well you must be gay cause you don\u2019t have any friends or you don\u2019t have a relationship.

His mother needs to help him move towards learning how to improve his self-esteem.", "I still stand on the fact they both need to apologize to each other.

Even as his mother. You just don\u2019t come out and accuse someone of being gay and telling him that you love them either way.\n\nThat would piss me off. I agree he shouldn\u2019t of snapped at her but I think they both need to sit down and calmly discuss all of this. She should\u2019ve been there to to try and find out where his depression is coming from. The I\u2019m ugly part is just denying he has depression and blaming it on physical appearance. There are some really ugly people that have been in happy relationships. And just because you\u2019re not in a relationship doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad thing either.\n\nThere\u2019s more going on here with him. He needs therapy and his mother should be helping him in that direction of trying to make His self-esteem better. That would be the best thing she could do. But when someone has depression issues sometimes the best of intentions make it worse", ">There was no accusation!\n\nUse context clues please. OP states they have had this suspicion since high-school. You really think this is the first time she has brought it up? You're acting like it was a one off comment but OP probably has heard remarks about his orientation for years.", "The problem here is what\u2019s lying beneath all of this. He\u2019s depressed he needs help with that the low self-esteem is just a symptom.\n\nYou don\u2019t come to somebody and say well I love you and if you love whoever guys or girls I love you anyway that is accusing him of being gay. Again there\u2019s nothing wrong with that but why do you say that to somebody?\n\nIf she really cared about him she should\u2019ve asked him what\u2019s going on? She should\u2019ve said well I know you haven\u2019t been happy and I would really like to help you with that. I would be willing to go to therapy with you if that would help you or if you\u2019d rather go alone I would support that. You just don\u2019t have this kind of conversation with somebody who\u2019s depressed and just feel hurt because they\u2019re upset. There\u2019s more going on here and as his mother she should realize that. He\u2019s an adult he\u2019s been going through this all his life but unfortunately people brush it off to  hormones and just overlook the behavior.\n\nI always stayed out of my children\u2019s love life. However, I was supportive of their choices and let them figure it out on their own. I have also told my children that I would be there for them no matter what.  but I never ever said to them it\u2019s OK to be gay I love you anyway the heck who says that.\n\nHe needs to be steered toward some type of therapy that\u2019s where she needs to be involved if he wants her to. I would hope that they would be able to work this out, but just saying well if you\u2019re gay that\u2019s OK because you don\u2019t have any friends or you don\u2019t have a relationship thats no way to go about helping him.", "No they've asked if he's dating, but haven't asked if he was gay.

It just makes you feel worse.", "Again, you're missing the point where her conversation was about more than just romantic relationships. It also included his lack of friends and lack of a social life in general. Even a \"severe introvert\" such as yourself has friends and you use things like reddit and likely other online platforms to interact with people. Online interactions are still interactions. If someone was perfectly happy being 100% alone, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Romantic relationships aren't the focus here although OP hasn't said that he doesn't want a relationship, I'd say he even implies quite the opposite.\n\nThe mom likely didn't know about the self esteem issues because OP likely kept them hidden when he lived at home and then he went off to college. I'll use myself as an example again: I'm 31 and my mom didn't know about my depression until last year when she sat me down and asked me what was going on with me. I had been struggling with it alone for damn near 20 years at that point because I chose to mask up as best I could to keep it hidden. She finally caught on and asked me about it when due to life circumstances I had to move back home for a few months. In that time I didn't go anywhere and my drinking skyrocketed. She caught a whiff that something was wrong and chose to open that dialogue. Again, it sounds like the focal point of the moms conversation here was her concern about his lack of social nourishment in general and then tacked on the relationship/orientation piece as well. Would we have rathered the mom show absolutely no concern?", "She didn\u2019t deserve to be yelled at like shes talking to a teenager\u2026 thats probably why OP cant get a gf and claims he is a \u201cnice guy\u201d \n\nI can understand being annoyed with the fact that everyone in your family thinks you\u2019re gay when you arent.. but the way he phrases it sounds like he has some homophobic thoughts as he phrases this \u201ci will love you no matter the gender\u201d as an \u201caccusation\u201d. If he had communicated with his mom about his feelings more (which seems like something he very well can do based off the conversation/she is open minded and just wants to figure out why her son is so secluded/unhappy) then them thinking he could be gay for 8 years wouldn\u2019t have even happy. OP needs a therapist", "Did you miss the part where his mom already apologized?", ">One of the biggest suspicions they have about me is that I\u2019m gay. I don\u2019t know why but since I\u2019ve never dated in high school, that was always a question.\n\nHe doesn't say \"I think they think I'm gay,\" there's no uncertainty here. Do you think he's lying?", "Absolutely. An example I can give from my personal life is that I was going through a difficult time in my early 20s. I wasn't seeking any mental health support for it, even though it probably would've been helpful.\n\nMy Dad noticed something wasn't quite right, but coming from a time and culture that didn't really deal with mental health, approached a valid concern in the wrong way, making things worse. What he said to me was \"you've been really irritable to us recently, I think you should try cognitive behavioural therapy\". Because I already wasn't feeling good, what I heard was \"you're being overly emotional and annoying, go to therapy to fix yourself so you're more palatable to us\", even though that wasn't what he was saying. A slightly different approach and the message can come out much more positively.", "Agreed. I have a (manipulative, controlling) family member who has made this assumption about me, despite being told multiple times by myself and other family members that I\u2019m not a lesbian. It\u2019s a weird af hill to die on, especially when the motivating factor for this belief is \u201cwell you\u2019ve been single for so long\u201d (even though I haven\u2019t been for two years; she apparently dropped it when someone let it slip recently - I\u2019m no contact with her now). And it\u2019s even worse for me because this IS something I\u2019ve been exploring the last five or so years, and having it pressed constantly (directly or indirectly) is really invasive and distressing, especially considering I\u2019m not in a rush to label myself (or come out).", "Yeah we had a guy in our friend group that didn\u2019t have a relationship even after the age of 25. We never asked him about it that was his business. We did sometimes amongst ourselves when he wasn\u2019t there kind of questioned it but it was not a big deal so it never went anywhere.\n\nAt the age of 30 he did have a couple of relationships and was even engaged once but come to find out it wasn\u2019t because he was gay he was just an idiot. We still care about him we\u2019re still friends with him and just accept him the way he is.", "If my mother saw me struggling and \"took me to get a haircut\" instead of having a heart to heart talk with me where she told me that she would love me no matter what. I would have never come out to her and other family.\n\nThe fix to low self esteem is not to buy things, its to talk about the problem and learn how to over come it. Buying things to cover it up is just pushing it to the side and not fixing the problem, it will still be there eating at you that the haircut didn't look as good as you hoped, or you think it would look better on someone else.\n\nAs a parent she is looking out for him, she lives with him and can probably see him hurting, and she is trying to understand why. I think youre wrong that most people won't like this. Almost every single lgbt person would love this, and thats the point. She doesn't know why her son is feeling this way, and she just wants to show that she loves him as her son and nothing can change that.\n\nETA: If on the off chance her son was actually gay this talk is incredibly helpful, if he reacts in a way that is less defensive and more open to talk about his emotions its also incredibly helpful. Yelling at someone who is concerned and wanting to help is the opposite of helpful", "You and I will just have to disagree on this. It didn't come across to me like the mother was pushing, just worried. And if she did think he was gay, why is that a bad thing? I still say OP is TAH.", "Im referring to your comment that being gay is some sort of ideology that one pushes.", "Yep, this has def happened to us! It was actually his *family* who said it!\n\nOnce, we were at a bowling alley and I thought it was obvious we were together. This guy walked up to me, in front of my then-bf, and said you are absolutely gorgeous and proceeded to try to chat me up. I was flabbergasted. I forget what my bf said, but he sort of jokingly said, I know right, I have good taste. We all laughed it off but I thought it was really rude.", "YTA\n\nApologise to your mom for snapping at her, thank her for her concern but your issue is not \"being gay\".\n\nFind a counselor to help you work on your self esteem.

I've been calling him that for 5 years now", "Because being non-confrontational and avoiding the uncomfortable conversation worked so well the many times he did it in the past. He pretty clearly didn't want to talk to his family about it, thus the intervention style sit down (she knew she was pressing). \n\nHe could have handled it *better*, sure. I don't see him as an AH for expressing frustration and he didn't actually explode or curse or anything like that.

From what OP described, she didn\u2019t put direct pressure on him to get a partner, although her phrasing reflects amatonormative social standards.", "It was his mother that was more concerned about his lack of a relationship than his depression.\n\nI hate when people assume because I\u2019m still single after my divorce that there\u2019s something wrong with me. Quite the opposite actually I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship I hated it. I do have some close friends and that\u2019s the way I want to keep it.\n\nBut the way she went about it and especially when a person is severely depressed Only makes it worse. He has very low self-esteem and that is something he should be working on and she should be helping him towards that. Nobody should care if somebody\u2019s in a relationship or not I know it\u2019s very irritating when they try and push you into one. My friend is always trying to say oh well you should go out with this guy or that guy I don\u2019t want to I\u2019m perfectly happy with the way my life is now.\n\nBeing gay or not is not the issue here. As his mother she should be looking at why he is so depressed why doesn\u2019t he feel that he is feeling better about himself and that should be the focus not whether or not he should have a relationship", "Then why accuse them of being gay? She could\u2019ve just said look I see you\u2019re unhappy, I wish there was something I could do to help you. She didn\u2019t have to go into all the other stuff. He probably has been depressed all his life and he does need therapy. I know people say that all the time but at some point we all need therapy whether we accept that or not is another story.\n\nShe was concerned enough to notice he didn\u2019t have any friends or a relationship that it bothered her enough to question his orientation. But she did say it with \u201clove\u201d although I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t come across to him as that.\n\nThat should never be brought up in any conversation like this unless he brings it up. All she had to say was you seem unhappy to me. Would you like to discuss it. You don\u2019t go into the whole thing with the lack of friends and relationships. Depression is the real problem here and she obviously has never picked up on it. And saying things like that to him will make him shut up and will make him not want to discuss anything.\n\nAnd I still feel they both need to apologize. He for snapping at her and she for making assumptions. If they can sit down and calmly discuss her concerns and his feelings that would be the best thing to do. She really needs to find out if there\u2019s anything she can do to help him through his depression. Offer to pay for therapy, offer to go to therapy with him, offer to support him.\n\nYou just don\u2019t snap out of depression when somebody tells you to.  She also needs to understand his feelings. This is what they should be discussing. Why does he think he\u2019s \u201cugly\u201d? Is there anything she can do to help him with this. This is what they should be discussing not his relationships.", "Agree with the therapy part. This is all stemming from Severe depression therapy and maybe the medication would be an immense help but not helping him through this and just saying while you\u2019re not in a relationship so there\u2019s something wrong with you it\u2019s not something a mother should say", "Yes", "He also doesn't say \"they've asked if I'm gay.\" The only time we know it's been mentioned is during the convo with his mom.

If it was just the moment then OP is the obvious asshole here. But OP gave us some background beforehand and judging by the background OP\u2019s family didn\u2019t make him feel ok at all. OP needed reassurance back then and instead they talked amongst themselves and didn\u2019t say anything. There\u2019s such a thing as saying the right thing too late. The mom could have said this a long time ago when he was still suffering, but chose this moment when things relatively calmed down to address it.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that OP is suffering from depression from the bullying he received and never got help for, and it also developed a form of anxiety since his entire image of himself is destroyed. It\u2019s something that OP needs to address and for his parents to finally realize and help him out. It\u2019s clear that they compare him to his other brothers and are worried that he isn\u2019t anything like them. But he doesn\u2019t need to be like them, he just needs to be a better him.\n\nThat\u2019s why I say ESH because his family didn\u2019t make him feel at all like he was worth anything until it was too late. Their negative actions and treating him like something was wrong, even IF unintentional, is what led to the heartfelt moment being ruined. That\u2019s why I say ESH.", "Reread the post. Mom is concerned about him feeling free to be himself. About him having a social life (not just a romantic partner). About him getting the most out of life.

She may have guessed incorrectly about what\u2019s causing it, but she\u2019s opening a dialogue about what is making him unhappy.\n\nIf OP hadn\u2019t overreacted to the suggestion that he could be gay, maybe they could have gotten to the actual root of the problem: his trauma from bullying, his self esteem issues, his feeling that he\u2019s behind where his brothers were at his age.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your pushy friends, but stop projecting your experience onto OP. It\u2019s not the same. You can talk about depression without saying the magic word.", "She didn't accuse him of being gay.

OP took it as such. \n\nA lot of what you're saying is kinda irrelevant to what actually happened. She tried to have a conversation, he immediately got defensive, flipped out on her and then stormed off. How was she supposed to get to the root of anything after that? I'm sure she would have tried to seek out the root causes of his self esteem and possible depression but he didn't give her that opportunity. That door isn't closed but OP is definitely in the wrong here for flipping out on someone who was concerned and trying to help. Also, I'm not sure why you mentioned the \"you don't just snap out of depression\" bit because the post makes literally no mention of his mom saying anything remotely close to that.\n\nAt the end of the day, mom was trying to help and being a concerned parent, OP bit her head off and then stormed off instead of actually having a conversation. He's TA and he should apologize. Maybe he'll recognize how lucky he is to have a parent that actually gives a shit.", "She literally didnt say that. She was worried he was hiding his life from her out of fear (being gay is kinda a sign in most places to get beat up/bullied etc unfortunately) \n\nI know all about depression and this really doesnt sound like major depressive disorder (im diagnosed).

He needs therapy to go through why he feels this way. Anyone who is in a deep depression is not going to have these kinds of discussions with almost anyone. My feeling is she should\u2019ve picked up on this a while back if she\u2019s so concerned about him not having a social life.\n\nI can see where he got upset about the conversation she should\u2019ve just left out all the orientation stuff And just said you know I\u2019m just concerned that you seem to be shutting yourself out. Is there something I can help you with, do you want to discuss it, etc.\n\nHe needs therapy and maybe medication but just coming out and saying well you\u2019re being a loner I\u2019m concerned about you are you gay blah blah blah no should never happen", "Just to let you know, the way you've laid out the situation your mum sounds like she really loves and cares about you.\n\nAsshole or not don't let this come between you, she's in your corner and just wants what is best fornyou", "Bro HATES gays lmao", "I get that its frustrating but if you lash out at your mother and make her cry when her only crime was trying to be supportive then no wonder you're not popular with women, cause a temper like that is *very* unattractive.\n\nYTA.", "Sorry, buddy, but YTA and maybe for more than just this post.

So you're right, in that he didn't say he told her he wasn't gay before that.  I would be a bit surprised if it hadn't come up before, given the way he describes things, but since he didn't put it in the post, we'll go with that being the first time he specifically said he wasn't gay.\n\nHowever:\n\n>Also, according to OP, all she said was that no matter who he loves she will be happy as long as they love him. That's not accusing him of being gay\n\nI mean, it's not a direct accusation of being gay, but it's the next best thing.  If she thought he was totally straight, if the question of him being gay or not never entered her mind, would she say that?  No, because it wouldn't be on point for her thoughts and concerns.  And at that point, **because** she is incorrect in her beliefs about him, it comes across as an accusation, rather than support.\n\nNow, rereading this post, it sounds to me like this has been an ongoing discussion rather than a one-time thing.  And I do think that if OP had openly talked with her earlier about why he doesn't date, things probably would not have gotten to this point, where his mother was trying to come up with reasons herself.", "Well he's commented this:\n\n>We\u2019ve been having this same conversation since I was 14.

In terms of how your boyfriend responded, he's right, too. It IS meant as a compliment to the guy (I'm more like your boyfriend than the guy who said it to him, my wife is out of my league). \n\nFor many people, they don't look at finding a partner as a search for someone who is compatible with you and makes you happy, they look at it as a search for \"the best\" person, however they define it. So the guy who pulled your boyfriend aside truly did mean it as a compliment to him to say \"you're not going to be able to land anybody 'better' than that, you should lock it down ASAP\"", "Kind of like monkeys", "My cousin is like this, as soon as she \"gets them\" she always loses interest in the guy.

I might add when people do these slight suggestions or almost allegations OP has been recieving a good chunk of his life they pick away at you until something like this happens. \n\nOP I wouldn't ho as far as calling you an AH but your behavior and how you handled this could have been better.

If this was the first time someone in his family assumed he was gay and he snapped at them then he would be TA, but sounds like it\u2019s something they\u2019ve wrongly been inferring about him for a while now. The guys already stressed and embarrassed over the fact he hasn\u2019t dated and doesn\u2019t have the confidence to try and date women, but then now moms here assuming he is gay because of it. I can totally see why that would irritate someone to the point of snapping, moms basically unknowingly adding insult to injury. But it also shows that she believes her son could find someone if he actually tried, so on the positive side at least it seems like she doesn\u2019t think her son is ugly or undateable. So definitely seems like a good intention by mom, just went about it the wrong way", "Totally agree--honestly from how I read this, it sounded like OP's mom was concern trolling, and that her intention was to \"subtly\" find out if OP is gay.\n\nEven if she had great intentions--maybe  OP's tone was harsh, but he was expressing his feelings after being asked about a very sensitive issue. That could cause anyone to sound angrier than they might otherwise. That's not the same as lashing out--he didn't insult his mom or anything, he just didn't cater to her feelings when being honest about his experience. \n\nAnd instead of then holding space for him and asking him more about how he's feeling, she made it about her and her feelings by crying, and then complaining to the older brother (who is attractive and cannot relate at all to OP's situation) about it, making OP the bad guy and mom the victim who just wanted to help \n\nI truly don't understand the YTA votes. Like ideally we will speak in a polite tone all the time but sometimes if something emotional comes up, people have feelings, and that's ok. \n\nMaybe OP can practice using \"I statements\" with his mom, i.e. \"I feel frustrated when you keep asking if I'm gay, and disrespected since I have already told you the answer many times, and it makes me feel even worse about my self image\" etc.", "Reminds me of that Everybody Loves Raymond episode where Marie REFUSES to believe that Robert is not gay because he keeps having bad luck with women.", "This is by far the most mature and well reasoned response I\u2019ve seen here.", "Couldn't have said it better myself.", "This is some strong projection my dude.

It's almost opposite of \"bad boys\". With them, women think they can fix him while society says, no, you can't. With insecure men, they say, just reassure him, compliment him often, and women are like no, it's not that easy, I can't fix him. Seriously. Guys like this are too much. It's oppressive having conversations with them. If you compliment, they argue back against it. If you tell them that they could find someone if they just would try doing a b and c, they will argue back about why a, b, and/or c won't work for them in particular or why they can't do a, b and/or c. Every conversation becomes about them and their insecurities. And it becomes clear that it doesn't really matter to them who is across the table from them, they would be having the same conversation, so you really don't matter to them at all. Even if you show interest, they'll deny it, or push you away. There is no space for you in that relationship, only their insecurities. And we really can't fix other people who don't want to fix themselves. They have to be willing to do that and put in the work. We can support, but we can't carry. And seriously, I want a partner, not a project.", "To be fair to the OP, being \"accused\" of being gay is equally as annoying for a straight guy as people telling me that being gay is \"just a phase\" or that I \"just haven't met the right woman yet\". I used to get that a lot from my parents when I first came out to them, and if they insisted on saying that to me now, I would snap at them too.\n\nObviously there's nothing wrong with being accused of being a closeted heterosexual, but it's not what I identify as.\n\nThe situation is exactly the same with the OP, only with the sexual orientations reversed.", "Honestly the pressure from his family to perform romantically gives him a pass from me, he very well could have had the same explosive moment if she was asking about a girlfriend, he's just fed up. Gives the same vibes as my grandmother constantly pestering me about if I have a boyfriend yet (I date girls). Asking if he was having any troubles connecting with people romantically or if he wasn't looking for that at the moment would have been a far more appropriate route, and I'd be less understanding of him bursting about not liking dudes like it was a crime to suggest they were an option.", "The same way a gay man would get irritated at being told \"you're not gay, you're straight, and this is just a phase\", OP is fed up with hearing the same thing.", "Agreed.

I mean, obviously, but it seems a lot of people miss the mark on that and focus on what OP and his mother said versus the reality of the whole situation, his struggles, his feelings. I don't know his exact age but have an idea through the context given and that gives me an idea of *when* he would've been in school, which makes a huge difference for bullying. With that said I can imagine that not only has he had his sexuality brought into question in this kind of way, but most likely had to hear it in slurs being bullied in school. \n\nI say NTA too, however he *does* owe his mother an apology and at least a brief explanation of why it triggered him, and I'll add that his brother needs to hear it and be told to chill out if you don't know both sides and maybe bring things up without being a dick about it... but that's just me. If you demand me to do something - it won't effect what I'm gonna do, short of telling you to get fucked and come at me right if you want a civilized conversation.", "Then why has she badgered him about his sexuality since he was 14?", "Why not try to date a nice girl who is also not very attractive? There\u2019s a lid for every pot as they say.", "My dude...I get it. Really, I do.\n\nFor context, I'm a woman. I just turned 32 this week.\n\nI date men. I have *always* dated men. I actively have crushes on men. I talk about how sexy men are all the time... In case you missed it, I am into men. Therefore I am straight. Like, you can calibrate a ruler to my sexuality, ya know?\n\nProbably once a month someone in my sphere implies I'm a lesbian. People who have known me for 10+ years. Family members. Childhood friends. Coworkers. Close friends.\n\nWhy? Honestly, I can't say for sure though I can guess... The very few relationships I've had that've gone anywhere never lasted long. Also, once I'm in a relationship, the actual content of it is private in my eyes, so I don't discuss it openly or often with people I know, even after the fact. So my people may know I was dating and it ended, but rarely why. Also, I've never been a deeply feminine woman. I played contact sports in my youth, I joined the military, I avoid makeup and fashion like the plague, the list goes on. So I probably don't scream, \"sexy single lady looking for my man\" when you see me, even if you know me well. And to top it all off, I don't much care. I am who I am, I know I'm a good person who cares about others and I lead a respectable, honorable life. I'm comfortable in my skin and I'm not going to change myself to fit expectations.\n\nI get the impression from my own experiences that the folks who make the implications feel one of four ways.\n1) The ones who genuinely don't know any better and don't honestly care, and simply want to ensure your comfort and happiness. They're the rarest group, but they do exist and they genuinely mean well. Those are the good ones.\n2) Then there's the folks who think that no one can lead a truly fulfilling life without being in a partnership, and they simply don't understand why your sole focus isn't on being one half of a whole. It's not so much that they think you're gay, it's just that they can't seem to comprehend you're single and not actively pursuing a relationship unless you're hiding something. The easiest thing they can think of that you'd be hiding is your sexuality. So they imply that's what you're doing so they can maintain their understanding of the world around them. Because if you're not gay, why wouldn't you be dating or actively trying to do so?!? This is the biggest group. They're annoying as all hell, but ultimately harmless. It's not so much that they feel one way or the other about it, but they just can't understand and are trying to make you fit into their mental framework. They're fine I guess. Annoying, but fine.\n3) Then there's the folks who actually think you're gay and want you to admit it. These then fall into two groups: the ones who don't really care and just want you to be happy, and the ones who feel like they'd be winning something if they were the first to get you to admit it. The first group is frustrating, but ultimately harmless. These are the ones who require a conversation to explain what's going on before they'll leave it be. A waste of time, and one I sometimes don't feel they are owed, but if they seem genuine it sometimes it is worth it just to give them an alternative perspective. They may genuinely not get it, and your conversation might keep them from doing the same thing to someone else down the road.\n4) The last group are the toxic outliers that give all the other categories a bad rap. These are the ones who actually think you're gay and want you to admit it but won't let it drop, who bring it up again and again. These are the ones who *just want to be right*. A discussion won't help. A kind brush off won't help. Witnessing a healthy, happy relationship between you and someone else won't help. They will never drop it, and it will never get better. This is sadly not the smallest group. I'd say probably 15-20% of the folks who bring it up are like this. I have no idea why. I have no idea what the point is, or what they get from it, or why they make it my problem when it's all in their own head. But they're really out there, and it really blows. I genuinely fucking hate these people. Because even after a lifetime of dealing with them, I don't know what to do about them.\n\nI bring these up because you'll probably always encounter these folks. I get the impression there are just some people who get profiled in this way, and I'm one of them. You probably are too. So yeah, it sucks like a mf, but it's your reality. It may be a good idea to figure out a way to become okay with it.\n\nIn any case, I would bet your mom is in the second group. She wants you to be happy, and she genuinely doesn't get that you can be even if you're single. But I understand why you acted like she's in the last group. Because after enough time, and enough encounters, you start thinking everyone is in that group.\n\nI won't call your mom an AH, because she's not. And I won't call you an AH, because I truly, deeply sympathize. But you do owe your mom an apology, because what you did was uncalled for and misdirected. But she also deserves a good long conversation so she knows she can't be bringing this up again. You both deserve that bit of closure.\n\nNo judgement my dude, but one last piece of advice. You're only as ugly as you think you are. Consider pursuing therapy to address your inner thoughts about your exterior appearance, yeah? Everyone deserves to think of themselves as worthwhile, and I think you might need to put in some work to get there. Best of luck homie.", " My husband is cute, he's just not a big guy.  Bigger guys will always attempt to step in front of him , or shoo him away like a kid. I have to be careful in how I respond.

Get some social hobbies that you (OP) enjoy. Make a few friends (even introverts need a few!) and acquaintances. D&D, if you are at all into it, is a particularly good one, as it teaches you how to be social, how to work with others, and if you give into the roleplay, can teach you more confidence and how be a bit more outgoing, but \"safely\" as another character, rather than being vulnerable and putting your true self out there. And it will show you how each member of a team brings something to a group that is of worth. You may not find a partner at the table, but you will find some friends. You can go to your local game store (tabletop games, not video games) or possibly comics store and find a local gaming group, or you can find one online if your town is too small/rural or you're not ready yet for in person games and would rather do it online, where it's usually over voice chat only (though some do use video chat as well). You can find online games right here at r/lfg. \n\nBut basically, work on yourself. Work on building up your confidence, work on having some fun, making some friends, learning to be social enough that you aren't alone so much, but without feeling uncomfortable due to your introvert tendencies. Work on some skills. As the commenter above noted, there are other hobbies you can explore, and sometimes, learning to make something with your own hands can really build up your confidence in yourself and you can learn useful life skills, like knitting/crocheting, woodworking, quilting/sewing, gardening, etc. Or get into something artistic that can also up your confidence, be a healthy emotional outlet and leave you with some nice artwork to display afterwards!

The background info leads you there. \n\nMom started with are you getting the most out of life\u2026I think Mom may POSSIBLY not been going toward \u201cfind a partner\u201d but maybe more toward \u201care you happy\u201d. Granted we don\u2019t know for sure, but based on OP\u2019s post, that\u2019s where I suspect things actually were. OP\u2019s own mind seems to be interpreting the rest.", "Unless she was afraid that he wasn\u2019t pursuing a relationship because he was afraid to come out. I didn\u2019t read it as she wanted him to date just that she was afraid maybe he didn\u2019t date because of that.", "I don't think they were referring to OP snapping at their mother; I think they were replying to the suggestion that OP gets therapy to work through their self image issues.", "First of all I am LGBT! It doesn't matter that it comes from good intention and that she is his mother. There are boundaries parents shouldn't cross. You can't corner someone into coming out. No! Never!\n\nWe regard parents way too highly. Being invasive is always always a no. Some things are private. Kids deserve their own share of privacy, unless they are harming themselves or someone else.", "I'm guessing it was toxic people at school that bullied him not his own family. It can have a lasting impact, my sister has had eating disorders and problems with mental health ever since she was bullied in school for being overweight. My brother was always getting into fights with bullies too, he's now been on antidepressants a while even though he recently graduated and got an engineering job and is doing better. I had my fair share of incidents with bullies too but had a large friendship group that always had my back so I didn't have it as bad as them.", "He says in a reply she\u2019s been doing this since he was 14 and he\u2019s repeatedly told her it\u2019s not the case so I think it\u2019s totally understandable he\u2019d be upset at having to constantly reiterate it", "If he decides to get therapy or hobbies to change his life that's his business. Maybe he isn't ready for that, maybe he doesn't want to or maybe has has tried and it just didn't work for him. Not having a relationship, for any reason, is a far cry from not being responsible for his life. You don't know what friends or interests he has. All we know is that his mom, his whole family, keeps rehashing a subject he wants closed down for his own reasons and he should have that right.", "This kind of thing has been said by bar dirtbags for forever.  Interestingly I've never seen a confident, attractive guy say it to someone else.  Always guys who just radiate that they're a-holes.", "When is this convention, and where?", "I have a friend that had trouble staying in a relationship. Somehow my husband and I got to talking about it, and I mentioned some things that happened in the past, because she looks better and I'm fat. His response was \"people are attracted to you because they can tell you're a good person\". Then it was just me going awwww....", "Look at Pierce Brosnan and his wife - she's a gorgeous big girl! Nothing wrong with that.", "\"Huge Cock and I'm Funnier than You! ....would have been my reply!", "As a ginger, I fuckin APPROVE of this. Also, I'm stealing it!", "Yes! Trying new things \u2014 not simply as a means to an end but because you think you might enjoy them \u2014 can be so rewarding. People are often attracted to people who are passionate about stuff. Cooking is a good example because it\u2019s a basic life skill, you can do it your whole life and still keep learning new things, *and* it\u2019s a great way to impress a date \ud83d\ude02", "Exactly. Compassion is what disadvantaged people need, not pity or abuse.", "This.\n\nI'm a happy single woman, however I'm also asexual (and somewhere on the aromantic spectrum). But even for me, the aromantic side of myself took longer to figure out than my asexuality. I knew I didn't want to have sex and was never sexually attracted to anyone. That, for me, was a whole lot easier to figure out.\n\nThe aromantic side is still a work in progress because for a while, I did also fall into a similar spiral where I thought I couldn't get into a relationship because of various reasons and it took me years to figure out I didn't want one, or need one, and I've been more content being single. And I also say this as someone who has never been in a relationship. \n\nIt took me a long time to go from \"I don't think anyone wants to date me...I'm fine with it, I guess, but I just am unattractive to people\" to \"I'm happier being single and I don't need/want to be in a relationship.\" Like, my mindset really shifted in the last couple of years and it really makes a difference. \n\nI do think societal pressure to \"be in a relationship\" and having a relationship as some sort of goal to be met doesn't help with the overall mindset, for sure. I have my own family members who also put the pressure on to be with someone, get married and even have kids as the endgoal. But it's also about finding peace within yourself that matters more. If you are fine with being single and happy, if you can accept that a relationship isn't an endgoal, even if it's more of a \"if it happens, it happens\", that shows off better than being self deprecating in many ways. I used to be self deprecating and put myself down a lot; now I just tell people \"I'm happy not being in a relationship.\" If it happens, it happens. But, where I am in my life, I have finally found peace with not being in a relationship and figuring out what that means for me going forward. But OP doesn't seem to be doing that; he wants a relationship and still has that mindset that that is what he needs to be happy. It's really easy to tell through his wording.", "Was it for years?  This sounds like it was the first conversation.  And why should anyone be upset about being \u201caccused\u201d\u2019of being gay?  There\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay.", "> OP went way beyond a negative vibe and skydove into self hatred.\n\nYour phrasing implies a high level of control and direction about his feelings about himself.", "This.  I have told my kids that I love them no matter what since they were born.  They have heard me tell them that I will love them if they are gay, I will love them if they are straight, I will love them if they are trans, I will love them if they get pregnant, I will love them if they get someone else pregnant, I will love them if they think they are unloveable, I will always love them.  I tell them that they can tell me if something is wrong.  I have had this conversation with them over and over and over again.  They  are probably tired of hearing it, but I never want them to think for a second that they are unloved.", "He specifically states he works, then comes home and doesn\u2019t really have a social life. The only way that will change is if his actions change. \n\nOf course it\u2019s his business whether he does it or not! I would never say otherwise.", "its everything you said but most importantly - it is the TIME to do all those things.\n\nyou have to be a special kind of rich to have that sort of free time on a daily basis to spend solely on your personal wellbeing.", "I was told that once! I just asked them what they meant, since I was obviously heavier than my husband. They got awkward and quiet and left quickly", "hey, as a guy, its kind of a compliment even if it was never meant to be one, lol.", "I think people underestimate how extremely sexy confidence can be", "If you have to ask, you're probably not welcome.", " Did you read the same post? this was his mom attempting a heart to heart and he snapped at her for no good reason. He's single because he's a snappy jerk, nothing else.", "She did the best with the information she has, I don't think she made an assumption that was out of left field. It was a sweet gesture for a kid she was worried about.", "You can be a happy single straight man. So yes, it would still apply.", "My grandma asked me why my boyfriend was dating me. . . As in he was out of my league and could do better.  Fuck, thanks grandma!!!!!\n\nI\u2019ve been with him for 22 years, happily married for 20 years and we have 3 beautiful children together.  \n\nI\u2019ve NEVER forgotten her comment.  Ugg", "It sounds so cliche but it's actually true. I am more concerned with a guy being able to show me a good time, be attentive and caring, be confident & social etc than I am with what he looks like. It's a bonus if he's conventionally attractive or whatever on top of that, but if a guy exudes confidence that's like, already the attractive part! (edit: I will say that this kind of thing is most obvious in person though. I haven't tried any kind of dating apps and I imagine it's more difficult to show that off there where you are making snap judgments on photos or whatever.)", "Eh, too old to care, so you're definitely right.", "I don't disagree but I want to point out that they're just answering the question you asked.", "I agree he's single because he's a snappy jersey but she's been bringing this up for 8 years. No matter how well intentioned it may be doesn't mean it needs to be entertained.", "You can, but it doesn't sound like OP IS a happy single straight man. He makes it clear several times that the reason why he's not in a relationship isn't because he doesn't really want one or need one, it's \"I'm ugly and girls don't like me.\"", "Yeah, this is the vibe I got as well. Mom sees he's unhappy and single and comes to the wrong conclusion that it's because he feels he can't be himself and date who he wants, rather than something else. She just wants him to be happy being himself, and if he could show he was happy being single, I'm guessing she'd be content with that.", "Yep, mom is likely picking up on the clear signs of depression this guy is giving and sought wisely to intervene in a loving manner.", "Yeah, I sympathize with the mom, yeah she\u2019s meddling but she clearly just wants her kid to be happy, and he\u2019s obviously not very happy with himself right now, just by how he talks about himself and his life. OP, don\u2019t take your anger out on your mom, or on other people, you have to try to like yourself before worrying about if other people like you or not.", "Yeah, all the language was \"I want you to be happy.\", \"You can tell me anything.\" \"I'll love you no matter what.\" \"I just want you to be able to be yourself.\" None of that was pressuring of any sort, it was trying to open a dialogue where he could feel safe talking to her about anything. Sure, the whole assumption that he would one day bring home a partner isn't something you should assume, but that's also a rather new-ish concept in our society and it's still not the automatic go-to for the average person, let alone someone raised in a previous generation, like Mom (I say as a Gen-X who is trying to keep up with all of these changes in the world since I first learned about it!). So while Mom maybe didn't do the best at this conversation and making OP feel comfortable enough opening up to her, she didn't deserve the vitriol either, in my opinion.", "I've experienced this. I had a girl who used every trick in the book to drive a wedge between me and my ex who was trying to win me back, and then I was cast aside a few months after she had \"won\".", "And women.", "I have also met a handful of women like this. Trash goes beyond gender!", "It was a rhetorical question but fair enough. I do think this guy thinks it's the best course of action, though, as he seems to be going other places in this thread and arguing that all the women here are lying and that the hole OP is going down is inevitable and the only course of action in life, to the point of *making a post about it* in another subreddit...", "I'll take your word for it, op must be in the thread commenting these things, as I don't see them in the post. \n\nI think if your mom isn't abusive and wants a heart to heart, that's the time to be open and tell her that you're not hiding anything, it's just that girls don't like you, and tell her about your pain and insecurity.\n\nIt's also the right time to tell her how it makes him feel to be asked about it all the time, and just lay down his trouble with their dynamic to her. \n\nHeart to hearts invoke white flag immunity to bring up anything as long as you do it kindly, in my book. Heart to heart = we're going to open up to each other with love and understanding and talk for a really long time.", "Yeah men do that to me too but me has permission :\u00b3", ">I'll take your word for it, op must be in the thread commenting these things, as I don't see them in the post. \n\nYea best way to see is go to OP's profile and look at comments. \n\nI guess I see it differently where a heart to heart has to be wanted by both people or it's just one person trying to make themselves feel better. The post comes off as OP is in a transitory position in his life and all the family cares about is how it looks to others. \n\nI also think it's crazy how many people in this sub think it's OK to badger someone about their sexuality for almost a decade and then go surprised Pikachu face when the person gets mad."]}
