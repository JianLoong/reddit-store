I just want to make that clear before people suggest I might be anything other than heterosexual. And obviously nothings wrong with being gay, but I\u2019m not.\n\nDespite this I haven\u2019t ever really been in a relationship or dated. I struggle a lot with women.  so it\u2019s not much a surprise to me, but it is to my family. My brothers both are in relationships. My oldest was already dating his wife when he was my age. My other older brother has never had issues finding women to like him. The difference is that I\u2019m a lot less physically attractive than they are and I\u2019m more introverted as a result of bullying throughout my entire life because of that. I have been told I\u2019m ugly throughout my entire life, even by random people in passing. I\u2019ve come to some level of peace with it so around \n\nMy family are constantly asking why I don\u2019t date and I always avoid just outright saying \u201cim ugly and girls don\u2019t like me\u201d.  One of the biggest suspicions they have about me is that I\u2019m gay. I don\u2019t know why but since I\u2019ve never dated in high school, that was always a question.\n\nI moved back in with my parents after graduating, I\u2019m planning on moving out soon, but my job in a different area isn\u2019t letting me start until November so I\u2019m working a different job until then and saving money. I haven\u2019t done much since graduation other than work and my parents are upset that I don\u2019t have a social life right now.\n\nSo my mom sat me down and tried to have a heart to heart with me about my situation. She told me that she feels like I\u2019m not making the most out of my life and said that she thinks that I\u2019m afraid to be myself around them and that\u2019s stifling my ability to live. She said that she really wants me to be happy and find friends and a partner. Then she said that it didn\u2019t matter which gender that the partner was as long as I was happy. \n\nThis came across as an accusation of me being gay. I asked what she meant by that and she said that she wants me to know that if I live a different lifestyle by myself i don\u2019t have to hide it and she\u2019d be happy as long as I brought someone home who I loved and who loved me. Again she\u2019s calling me gay. So I shut that down. \n\nI kinda snapped as I\u2019m so tired of it. I snapped at her that I\u2019m not gay and that I don\u2019t need her to monitor everything in my life. I said that it\u2019s none of her business why I\u2019m single, but if she really cares that much it\u2019s because I\u2019m too ugly for women to want to date me, and since there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it she needs to drop it.\n\nShe got very upset and apologized. That evening I got a call from my oldest brother demanding I apologize to my mom. He said she was trying to be supportive and I was a huge dick to her. I said she was in the setting for the constant accusations and prying.\n\nAITA?\n\nI kinda snapped", "created_utc": 1688741413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14t9f3e/aita_for_making_my_mom_cry_after_she_asked_me_if/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it was your friends asking if you were gay for the millionth time in a dumbass way, snapping would be more appropriate. Your mom was just being your mom. Good parents are often worried that their children aren't happy in life so it sounds like she was doing a wellness check while also throwing it out there that if you were gay, she'd be supportive and you'd still be her son. Apologize to her. Explain why you got so heated about it and that it wasn't because of her.", "NAH. Sounds like a normal interaction to me. Normal as in, a normal tough conversation between parent and child. She was trying to be supportive but kept pushing something that bothered you, and you snapped at her about backing off. It happens. No one did anything extreme. An apology for snapping sounds appropriate but that\u2019s about all that seems necessary. During that conversation you could also gently let her know that you\u2019d appreciate it if she backed off on the other stuff as well.", "YTA\n\nI can't tell you why your family think this but they did the correct thing if you were. \n\nYou aren't.\n\nYou bit your mums head off when they were trying to be supportive. You seem more concerned with being labelled as gay than your mum giving you some heart to heart moment.", "YTA\n\nApologise to your mom for snapping at her, thank her for her concern but your issue is not \"being gay\".\n\nFind a counselor to help you work on your self esteem. Even if you are \"too ugly\", ugly people have relationships all over the world.", "NTA. It's gets fucking annoying when people constantly bring up a lack of a partner. You've made a point of why you were single before. They should have left it at that. It's none of their business. There's been threads before where the OP is a woman, and there wasn't a Y T A to be seen.", "YTA, sounds like she just cares about you and wants you to know she loves you no matter what.", "YTA for snapping at your mum for being concerned for you. Ugly people date all the time. Honestly, it's more likely your attitude that puts women off. I wouldn't want to date someone as volatile as you and getting mad at someone for trying to be welcoming and encouraging. My husband would say he isn't handsome, but I disagree!! Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but besides that, my husband is kind, caring, funny, and would absolutely NOT snap at someone who was showing concern and acceptance. And we've been together almost 20 years.\n\n\\*Edited to add a few details.", "YTA! Your Mom was trying to let you know she supports you no matter what. I get that you aren't feeling the accusation, but she's your mother, expressing concern and love for her child, saying she just wants you to be happy, also meaning as your mother, she knows you're unhappy. Yes, you owe her an apology for snapping at her, making her cry etc. You also need to get yourself into some sort of therapy to work on how you see yourself.  Beauty is subjective, you put yourself down wayyy too much and that too can be creating your own self sabotage for a relationship. Work on yourself, your self-esteem and apologize to your mother for simply loving you and wanting you to be happy.", "yta and this personality is the real reason you're single", "YTA. Your mother was expressing concern for you and tried to be supportive in case you felt like you couldn't be yourself (ie gay). She was mistaken in her assumption but the thought is what counts here. Look I get it, I didn't really date until I was 28 because I thought I was too ugly for girls/women to like. I imagine my family may have harbored thoughts that I was gay or at least anti-social. You don't bite the heads off those who love you when they express concern. You could have calmly stated you weren't gay, but rather suffering from low self esteem or even just \"I haven't found the right person\". But you had to flip out over it which makes YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your mother really cares and has more concerns then just the gf thing but you\u2019re too focused on that to see her POV and see any truth.\n\nMight want to take a step back on this one and look for truth.", "YTA, yta million times over", "YTA but also a tendency of ESH.\n\nYour mom said these things out of care for you and you should be grateful she is so willing to support you no matter what. It was wrong to snap at her even though she was trying to hurt you. You should really go to her and apologize. \n\nYour family (or only mom) only wants to help you, but I also believe it is wrong to assume things based on speculation. The way you explain it sounds like she sincerely believes you are gay. \n\nBut I have faith in all of you since you all seem to be caring and want each other\u2018s happiness. You would all go a long way of talking to esch other and explain things. Without snapping at each other", "Honestly I don\u2019t blame you for snapping . This narrative that people run with thinking that someone must be gay just because they don\u2019t see them out with women is tiring asf .just because someone doesn\u2019t date does not mean they\u2019re gay . Im 31years old and my parents has never questioned me about dating or asked if I was gay because they don\u2019t see me dating . They don\u2019t ask because they know it\u2019s not any of their business and if I wanted them to know I would tell them. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThis is clearly an issue that has bothered you, and while your mom meant well, it's not her job to attempt to divine what your sexuality is. She also needs an education into what makes for healthy relationships, since she apparently doesn't think that adults can function without them.", "YTA - this comes across like your mom was concerned for you and you flipped out.", "YTA - Your mum was trying to let you know that she supports you no matter what. Maybe what she did annoyed you, but that's more down to your own annoyance with yourself rather than what she did.\n\nI've been in a similar situation. Hadn't introduced a girl to my family once because I rarely had any relationships that lasted long enough to warrant introducing them, so from my family's point of view I was never involved with anyone. My mum invited me over one day, sat me down and told me how much she loved me and \"I'd love you if you were gay, too\". That was her way of trying to let me know that she would love me no matter what (my mum was born in the 50s and her generation aren't always the most accepting). I had a chuckle with her, let her know that I love her and really appreciate the sentiment. I also told her that I was straight and would introduce her to my next girlfriend.", "N T A\n\nWhen I was younger my family would insist, imply, infer, and damn near accuse me of being gay because I wasn't trying to f*ck everything in a skirt. \nIt gets frustrating trying to justify not doing what other expect regardless of the reasons. Your mother is terrible. She's not \"being supportive\". She's insistent that you pair up because it would make HER feel better about herself. You being single makes HER feel like a failure and she can't stand it so she hides behind fake encouragement.\n\nSorry you feel bad about your looks. You take the time you need to feel good about yourself before you put that on another person.\n\nBest wishes, buddy!", "Soft YTA. Sounds like your mom was genuinely concerned and was trying to provide a space where you could come out. While she was wrong, she is your mom and seems to love you. Sorry you are going through this. There is someone for everyone, try hitting the gym. Getting in really good shape does wonders for confidence and mental health.

Watch how different your answers will be", "YTA, what is so hard about saying \"thanks for doing your best to be supportive mom, but I'm not actually gay.\"? Your mom was reaching out, out of concern for you. Instead of yelling at her, you could have just explained how you feel about your looks and that your history of being bullied has made you somewhat introverted and quiet. Or that you don't think your status as single should be a symptom of being unhappy or not being able to be who you are. Setting aside your sexual orientation specifically, there is nothing wrong with being gay, for anyone. And there is nothing wrong with telling a person that you love them no matter who they love. Why did you take this concern as an insult when it clearly wasn't meant as such? There are so many ways you could have handled it differently, you could have told her so many things, but you chose to yell and make your mother cry.", "YTA.

That being said, I think it's much better to have a good personality than being pretty (for men and women).

And if she cannot accept how he feels she is not being a good mother. She should have asked him why he is not pursuing other things in life. He may be should not have snapped at her, but they should\u2019ve sat down and said hey look this is how I\u2019m feeling about myself that is why I\u2019m not in a relationship and she should\u2019ve accepted that.\n\nHe needs therapy no doubt.

Do you things that will maybe help his self-esteem.\n\nI had a friend who amongst us sometimes had the conversation that he might be gay but we never got involved in that part of his life. He did have a few girlfriends was even engaged once but it turned out he was just an idiot. We are still friends with him and his personal life is none of our business.\n\nI think mom owes him an apology was making accusations instead of Staying out of that part of his life and just support him and his future.
