He was in the city we live in for a work event and thought he could use the opportunity to catch up with us as a family. His family includes his wife (Amy - 35) and their sons (9M and 7M)\n\nMy wife (Juliette - 34F) and I (32F) live with our twins (8F and 8M) in a spacious house so overall we were thrilled to have them over. Our kids were also very excited to see their cousins. \n\nJuliette is a physician, and is also very devoted to her profession. We have a room with several shelves in our house that we all use only for reading. Juliette still keeps many of her old textbooks and new books, journals, etc there, and gives them a read every other day (she prefers paper copies of most books). She adores her books and takes excellent care of them. \n\nOur kids often join her for these reading sessions, as do I. They bring their homework, I bring my laptop and Juliette opens a book and her laptop simultaneously. She leaves her books on the table sometimes. Even though we haven't even told them not to, our kids never touch her books or my laptop.\n\nWhile Aaron's family were with us, I was surprises by how uncobtrollable my nephews were. My brother and SIL also never told them not to do something which probably exacerbated the situation. The last day they were with us, they went as far as using markers and drawing over some pictures in Juliette's books. She asked our nephews if they had done it and they proudly announced that they had, also asked if they'd done a good job. \n\nJuliette was absolutely furious and disappointed but didn't say anything other than \"these aren't coloring books and you shouldn't touch other people's belongings without asking first\". She asked me to talk to my brother about this. I told Aaron about the incident and said it was clear his kids has no sense of discipline. \n\nHe accused me of raising my kids like they were in a military and said doing things like this were a part of normal childhood. The argument escalated from there and got very bad. We now still don't talk the way we used to. It has me thinking if we were overreacting.

Kids 9 and 7 years old attend school and MOST CERTAINLY KNOW BETTER than to mark up adult books with a marker.  Im certain the school nor parents allow them to destroy school textbooks or their parents' books, without any consequences.\n\nTherefore given the.ages of 9 and 7 it seems highly probable that they deliberately destroyed your wife's books, with full knowledge it was wrong -- either as a prank, or because they dont like your wife, or because they've heard their parents saying negative things about her reading room or her books and thought their parents would think it was funny.\n\nIn my opinion there is ZERO chance that they didnt deliberately choose to destroy her books knowing it was wrong.  That is quite simply just isnt something 9 and 7 year olds do unless they have some severe developmental issues.", "NTA.  Your brother is just another irresponsible AH who is afraid to act like a parent.  And put a lock on the book room door.", "NTA. Your brother is the asshole for raising disrespectful little gits. No, this is not normal childhood, this is unhealthy and boundary-lacking childhood. \n\nThe trouble is, once they grow up, they will still be disrespectful gits, just not tiny and cute anymore. Better to be raised like in military than end up in juvie. But what do I know\u2026", "NTA\n\nSo your brother is teaching his kids to be no more accountable for their actions than he is willing to be. \n\nYou're not overreacting, they damaged your property and faced no consequence, and your brother tried to deflect away from it with a boys will be boys argument. If I were in your shoes, I probably wouldn't allow them back until its addressed.\n\nGiven that your brother apparently takes the view that this is just something you should expect children to do, you have no reason to believe that your possessions will be safe and respected when they are present.", "NTA. \nDestroying property isn\u2019t a normal part of growing up. Using a book to color in while 3 is normal and that\u2019s why parents need to put that stuff away. 7&9 they know better. \nI would have kicked them out. \nMake the parents pay for the books. If it has consequences for the parents maybe they will figure out that there needs to be consequences for their brats.", "NTA.  Destroying others' property should not be a \"part of normal childhood.\"  If the nephews are acting like this, it's probably a parenting failure.  Your brother just doesn't want to accept his failure here.", "NTA. If they were 2 I might have forgiven them. They should know far better at 8.", "NTA\n\nDon't draw/color in books which aren't coloring books is a toddler era lesson. A 9 and 7 year old should be long past requiring the type of lessons which are learned by 2-3 year olds.", "NTA. Parenting his kids is your brother's business. Once they damaged your (wife's) property, it became your business. Honestly, I don't care what you do at home...but teach your kids to respect other people's stuff.", "I would expect a 3 yo to do what those children did, not a 7 and 9 yo. At those ages, they should DEFINITELY know better. This issue rests fully on your brother and SIL. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Those kids are far too old to be behaving that way.", "NTA- if kids that age did that to my books I would go crazy. And tell them. \nWhat is wrong with your brother??? He tried to turn it back on you- ask him what would happen if his kids did that to school books.", "NTA, your bother and his kids are.\n7 and 9 is too old for that sort of behaviour. They are heathens. Your children behave themselves, and your brother uses that to insult you and deflects from disciplining his heathens. I was a little terror when I was younger, but I also got disciplined, as that is a normal part of childhood.", "People do have different methods of bringing up children  and there is no one right way and indeed children themselves are different and I do think it was out of order to say his kids had no sense of discipline, but I understand your frustration. You should have told the parents about the damage and asked them to make it right by replacing the books. It is up to them how they then discipline the boys. If he went on to defend his kids and say they did nothing wrong, you would be justified in saying they had no discipline. What he said was judgemental too, but it seems like he was triggered by your judgements first, so I say ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Children of that age are old enough to know better than to draw in random books - they aren't toddlers.  While they were guests in your home, it was contingent on your brother and SIL to make sure their children behaved like proper guests and did not do damage to your home.\n\nYour brother and SIL are just as responsible for this as the kids - they are their kids, and they should have been keeping an eye on them to make sure they didn't get into any trouble.", "NTA. And you did not overreact. Those kids either did it on purpose, or they have quite severe developmental delays - and I presume its the former as you havent mentioned any difficulties. \n\nScribbling in books when you are NINE and SEVEN Is not part of a \"normal childhood\"", "\"She asked me to talk to my brother about this.\"\n\nI think that was a mistake. It was her or your responsibility to discipline or scold them.\n\nWhile your brother might be right about how normal the behavior is and your child rearing practices, it's more he's playing \"the best defense is a good offense\". But YTA for accusing him of failing to appropriately discipline his children when it was your and your wife's responsibility to do so. I believe the comment was of a type that is not far from passive aggressive in being a bit of a bait and switch. I would vote differently if you had done everything the same and merely given a demand for your brother to have a serious conversation with them.", "Unpopular opinion ehs \n\nKids do act like that and you low key sound uptight. Your brother and his wife suck because they made no effort throughout their stay to tell their kids to do anything. You need to chill out a tad and your brother needs to be less chill and do more parenting", "Absolutely. I wouldn't have dreamed of behaving this way at their age and I had a very lax upbringing. OP sounds like he's doing everything right. not their fault", "Yes toddlers 1, 2 maybe 3 year olds but older kids 9and 7 do not behave that way.  Do you think the school they attend allows them to destroy textbooks in school by marking in them with markers?  No, schools would not tolerate that and would make the parents pay for the books and the children would receive a discipline at school for such behavior \n\nThere is 100% liklihood the kids did this deliberately with malice knowing it was wrong."]}
