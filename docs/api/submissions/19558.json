We have a room with several shelves in our house that we all use only for reading. Juliette still keeps many of her old textbooks and new books, journals, etc there, and gives them a read every other day (she prefers paper copies of most books). She adores her books and takes excellent care of them. \n\nOur kids often join her for these reading sessions, as do I. They bring their homework, I bring my laptop and Juliette opens a book and her laptop simultaneously. She leaves her books on the table sometimes. Even though we haven't even told them not to, our kids never touch her books or my laptop.\n\nWhile Aaron's family were with us, I was surprises by how uncobtrollable my nephews were. My brother and SIL also never told them not to do something which probably exacerbated the situation. The last day they were with us, they went as far as using markers and drawing over some pictures in Juliette's books. She asked our nephews if they had done it and they proudly announced that they had, also asked if they'd done a good job. \n\nJuliette was absolutely furious and disappointed but didn't say anything other than \"these aren't coloring books and you shouldn't touch other people's belongings without asking first\". She asked me to talk to my brother about this. I told Aaron about the incident and said it was clear his kids has no sense of discipline. \n\nHe accused me of raising my kids like they were in a military and said doing things like this were a part of normal childhood.

We're charging you for a replacement.\"\n\n2) A book on dog training that came back in the book drop all chewed up. Guess it didn't take.\n\nBonus) Speaking of the book drop. We had a load of materials come back in the book drop once that, I don't know, must have been old and sitting in someone's basement for years. It was covered in mold. And not just a little bit of white fuzz. Like the edges of the pages were a thick carpet of these, like, huge black spore growth.
