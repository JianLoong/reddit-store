It's quite normal where I live to stay late with your parents, especially with the energy crisis now. I live with my bf in a collocation.\n\nSince I was a teenager my front teeth are very crooked, but the moment I should have put braces is when my parents split up and they were not taking care of us (I had to take care of my sister and half sister (3) when I was 12, oldest daughter privileges) they did got better a few years ago, but I was almost an adult and it would not be reimbursed anymore.\n\nSo last year I took it upon myself to see if I could do it now, I really struggle with my image now, never open my mouth more than I need to talk, etc... I just want to be able to smile. And I can do it, but it's going to cost me more than 5k, so I tried to save as much as I can but due to Covid then the energy crisis, the place where I worked went into bankruptcy and I had to dip a lot into my savings. My parents said they would help me with 1500\u20ac each, since it's their fault they didn't do it sooner, and they paid for my sisters braces, and I'd have to come up with the rest of it.\n\nThe issue is I learned that my sister, who's shopping addicted btw (if you have some advice on how to help her, that'd be great...) owes my mother more than 6k, so my mom can't help me right now, and my dad won't help me untill my mother can, but I don't know if she will see her money again one day tbh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell a few days ago my sister mocked me when I smiled, saying I really should fix that, that my bf is going to leave me and that I'm horrible, that she's ashamed to say I'm her sister.

At this point saving up is the only thing you could do, because holding them accountable for something that there's no going back to just seems to make yourself upset, especially since how tied up they seem to be about being able to help you (wtf with your dad, being able to help you now but choosing not to).\n\nYour sister was way out of hand and got the lashing she's been asking for, but that's almost a different issue.
