Or, they want an excuse to break the rules and sympathy from others for facing consequences.\n\nI'd bet you a donut that even if you tell him outright, all you're going to get are excuses in return. If you remind him he's not special, he's going to be angry that you don't agree with his excuses, and that you didn't reassure him that he's \"special\" and the rules shouldn't apply to him.\n\nYou're NTA but you are wasting your time with this person.", "You wouldn\u2019t be TA imo. Your friend screwed up and needs to know why or he\u2019s going to do it again. You can\u2019t just not show up to work and expect to have a job.", "NTA, but I would explain that the company only needs to state their expectations once, and in the future he will need to follow them, and give his bosses plenty of notice if something changes.", "If you don\u2019t know the full story, don\u2019t get in the middle of it. The best thing you can do is advise him to call HR for clarity on the company\u2019s decision.", "IF your friend asks why he got fired I would find a calm and respectful way to address it. If you tell him you\u2019re an idiot for not going to work and doing your job\u2026you would be. But otherwise: NTA", "All these YTA,,, man, I hope my friend is able to call me out on my shit and vise versa it makes us better people.", "NTA, but don\u2019t expect your friend to want to hear it. \n\n1) I would ask to see his contract, or if not available ask what it says.  Like, what does it say about the requirement for time worked in the machine shop?  \n2) Ask him to describe/rate his attendance.  Not the reasons for him missing work, the actual percentage he was where the contract says he needs to be. \n3) Ask him if he completed his work assignments on time. \n\nIf he gives the same kind of answers you described but doesn\u2019t get it, play devil\u2019s advocate.  Ask him to pretend that he is a boss in any company and is evaluating an employee.  This employee often isn\u2019t where you expect him to be, falls behind in his work and calls out with little advance notice.  What would *he* do with that employee?", "You wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the asshole, but you might want to think about how you\u2019re going about it. Two things I\u2019d consider:\n\n1) For a lot of people, immediately after something goes sideways is not a time when they\u2019re able/ready to take in constructive information. Even if he is saying \u201cI don\u2019t understand, why did they do that,\u201d he may not actually be asking for the information as much as wanting to vent/blow off steam. I think of it as whether their question really ends with ? Or if it is more a ?!?! If it\u2019s the latter, they\u2019re not really asking, they\u2019re just voicing their emotions. \n\n2) You say you don\u2019t really know the whole story. Obviously you know some of it, and what you know seems pretty clear cut. But maybe - when he\u2019s cooled down a degree or two and dropped at least one exclamation mark from his expressions of disbelief - you can ask questions to help him see it. Did his supervisor ever talk to him about the attendance requirement? Did they talk at all about how/when he needed to give notice of absences or get permission to work from home? Did other people work from home without getting clearance? He might get more from it if you help him work it through himself and figure out why he got the culture and expectations so wrong.", "I find it very hard to believe that your friend was able to suddenly wfh without being approved for it. But you can share your opinion. NAH", "NTA, but unless you\u2019ve spoken with his supervisor, you only *think* you know why your friend was fired. Yes, it\u2019s likely a good guess, but there may be even more at play you\u2019re not aware of like misuse of company time/resources. Framing the discussion around things you do know, e.g. \u201cWeren\u2019t you supposed to be in the office Monday \u2013 Friday?\u201d \u201cWhen you were late with the task(s), didn\u2019t that have a ripple effect and put your coworkers behind schedule?\u201d IOW, help him learn from the situation.", "NTA, BUT! It's not your place to explain it unless he asks sincerely. He just wants to vent to his friend, so listen, hit him with a \"that sucks\" or two, and try to cheer him up. Sounds like some things have broken against him lately, so he just needs your support, not a lecture. \n\nAs others have pointed out, he probably knows exactly why he got fired.", "Ywta,  there is no win in this for you.   If he explicitly asks you,  I would suggest you tell him to ask his supervisor for an exit interview or feedback.  If he insists you could tell him,  but it\u2019s a last resort", "YTA. Why would you do that ? Your friend already knows why : he just don't think it's fair. Support him instead of trying to pour salt on the wound.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
