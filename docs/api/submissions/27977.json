You have no responsibility over your stepsister. She dug her grave and since she is the golden child, she can go love with her mother. I feel for you that your father is acting this way with you.

No no no no please under no circumstances accept this. If they continue to push you on this, tell them exactly what you told us!

They probably won't, but you've lost nothing. Wishing you all the luck in the world!", "NTA at all, your parents can take her in if they're so concerned. They've enabled her shitty behavior for years and you shouldn't be punished for that. Do not let her move in. And I think this is your cue to go from LC to NC.

Zani's not a sister or friend to you, you didn't even know she had a baby so you aren't even really acquaintances anymore.  DO NOT let her stay with you, she will disrupt your life and dump her baby on you, and you will be stuck with them both.  \n\nMaybe your LC with your father and his wife needs to become NC.  If you do choose to talk to your father, let him know you only called to tell him you were doing well and had your own place.
