Hard pass.\n\nEta: I hope Mia doesn't actually know where you live.", "NTA\n\nAvoid this shit show and these low quality people.", "NTA go no contact. Block their numbers and if she ever turns up at your door call the police\n\nAlso so what she takes benzo's on prescription - she can put them in an actual safe in her bedroom.", "More like you're racist and insecure to attack OP. So maybe instead of call them an a.h. point that finger to yourself.", "Why can\u2019t I upvote this a thousand times?!", "Send this to him", "Great articulation, to the point without being malicious (when she has every right to be) and leaves the ball in his court.", "You worded that beautifully and I hope OP sees this and uses it. So well said.", "Wow. I think I love you \ud83d\ude02 please come do this for every person in my life", "Couldn\u2019t have worded it better!", "Well said.", "Facts.  This is the weirdest housing arrangement I\u2019ve ever seen a parent ask of their kid.", "Wow, what an asshole", "Mia can get a small safe for meds. Very inexpensive. And you go NC for a little while to reestablish the LC when and if you want to after they all settle down their entitlement", "**NTA** \n\nMia is just trying to bully you for a free place to park her thieving, cheating, drug addicted daughter and grandchild. \n\nIt is good that you are now in a situation where you can say no to her gaslighting.", "Yeah and it won\u2019t be for the \u201cfew days\u201d like she said.  Zani will move in and you won\u2019t be able to get her out. \n\nPlus Zani wouldn\u2019t have had this problem if she wouldn\u2019t have cheated.", "Listen to this OP, it's great advice.\n\nAlso wanted to give a sweet nod to this sweet phrasing:\n\n> These people will continue to take until they've taken the last shirt off your back and then they'll cry it's the wrong size.", "Dude/Dudette. Latte's are not the magical answer to money problems. I don't buy lattes and I have saving problems because of health issues. (Don't send me your uber link because I can't drive due to said health issues).", "\"a few days\" almost certainly means \"until you have to evict them\"", "Just because it always needs to be said AGAIN.   \n\n#DO NOT LET AN ADDICT MOVE INTO YOUR HOME.\n\n  If her own mother can't let her stay in the parents' house because of the addiction, no way should OP let Zani ever step foot in her house.    \n\nShe will lie.    \nShe will steal.   \nShe will destroy your home.    \nShe will destroy your SANITY.", "I think it\u2019s just step sister & her baby: she cheated and it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s with the husband coz if that. OP don\u2019t let her in your place!", "A locked wall mounted key box is available at any hardware stores. It\u2019s an excuse, both my brothers were addicts; I understand what you are going through but enabling her will not help her", "That is what I thought... she would!! steal from you.", "I would allow one conversation with your father on the condition he didn't say a word until you have said all you need to say to him including the fact that Zani might have lost her father but you not only lost your mother but HIM (your father too) to the moment he started to prioritise his stepdaughter over you, his child. Due to HIS CHOICES you were orphaned emotionally.\n\nIf your father does not handle YOUR reality well, then you will know how you need to proceed contact wise. Put your mental health first and at minimum go NC with your steps.", "That might be worth adding to the OP - she's had a history of stealing precious things from you. What does your fiance/husband think of having her move in? I can't imagine he'd want an addicted theif living with him? He has a right to feel safe in his home, as do you.\n\nI personally wouldn't let her over the threshhold - you don't get on and it doesn't sound like you ever did; you had to make your own way because your family wasn't very supportive.\n\nStepsister's situation is entirely of her own making; she and her mother can deal with it and leave you out of it. Enjoy your job and apartment.  NTA.", "Did you ever get your ring back? Did she pawn it for her substance issues? NTA", "You\u2019re no more obligated to her than I am, she has never treated you like family and this extra information confirms you are definitely NTA. What happens to Zani is not your problem to sort out.", "All the more reason not to let them in. NTA", "Did you get it back?  Is your dad aware that Z stole from you?", "Then she has a baby daddy", "Unless you mean literally in her pocket at all times, that ain\u2019t gonna help. 100% Zani is gonna just wait until Mom\u2019s purse is unattended and just snatch them. She needs a lockbox in a secure hiding place.", "As a recovering addict, I can tell you that lockbox would still be opened. Never underestimate what an addict will go through or do to get what they want. The only thing I couldn\u2019t get open was an actual heavy duty safe with an electronic keypad lock on it. But I still tried every chance I got.", "Going cold turkey on benzos is one of the rare circumstances where going cold turkey can be directly harmful (even fatal) not just unpleasant.\n\nShe could likely still work it out if both reducing/eliminating dependency *and* taking them them in were priorities, but going cold turkey on a physiological benzo dependency is not a good idea.", "No offense but if she\u2019s at that point of addiction still, is the baby even safe in her care? Even more the reason for the grandmother to have them under close eye.", "Absolutely. My mom and brother were/are (my mom passed from unrelated issues) recovered addicts. When they're here, I lock my medications and keep the key in my bra.", "100% this! Yeah Mia should put her child and grandchild as priorities but you can't just stop taking benzos. That's a big part of why doctors hate prescribing them. I need sleep aids and we are trying everything possible before those because I don't want to risk having yet another medication I can't just choose to stop taking. (I have one that's not \"addictive\" but if I miss a dose, about six hours later I start getting dizzy, sick, and get brain zaps. Not fun)"]}
