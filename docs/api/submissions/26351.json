We have a handful of beautiful children and for the most part have a very happy marriage and life together. We are about to move into our dream home, it has enough space for all of us to have our own bedrooms and I have asked that my husband and I move into separate bedrooms when we move there. My husband is very offended by this request but the thing is my husband is a snorer. A terrible terrible snorer. He also has sleep apnoea and I just do not get any sleep. It is so loud I honestly don\u2019t think I can go on like this anymore I\u2019m so tired it\u2019s been decades. I\u2019ve tried ear plugs I\u2019ve bought a headband with music playing headphones. He\u2019s even had surgery to try and fix it. But the nights I sleep the best are the nights he works and it\u2019s a huge noticeable difference when he\u2019s back. \n\nI don\u2019t want to upset him I just feel so much happier and healthier and less stressed when I get a good nights sleep and those nights are the nights when he\u2019s not in the bed. \n\nI don\u2019t want to upset him but I really really want my own space. He thinks this is me taking the first step of leaving him but it is genuinely me wanting regular consistent sleep patterns. \n\nSo AITA? Do married people really need to share a bed?\n\nEDIT: just to answer a couple of questions: \n\n1. He is in the process of sleep studies for the sleep apnoea. He previously had a polyp removal which helped for a short period of time and then a full UPPP surgery that also helped for a period of time. It tends to revert back though so we are now exploring possible revision of the polyps and getting sleep studies done for sleep apnoea. He has had sleep studies done in the past but those said he didn\u2019t have sleep apnoea so we went down surgical routes. But I\u2019m certain he has it so we are exploring that now again. Living fairly remotely means that getting in to see doctors and specialists takes time. He can\u2019t see an ENT until mid next year (it\u2019s crazy I know!). \n\n2. I have definitely explained to him the reasons behind wanting separate rooms. He is also a shift worker so our sleep schedules are often very different. He gets up at 3:30am to leave some mornings and other days he\u2019s returning home at 6am. The mornings he comes home at 6am I\u2019m expected to vacate the bedroom when he goes to bed so I don\u2019t disturb him as the children will often come in and out for cuddles and chats and whatnot. This is especially difficult on weekends as I do enjoy a good sleep in and the kids are old enough to let me do that. I am not a morning person so I don\u2019t care for this option! \n\nI hope that helps a bit!", "created_utc": 1694050871, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16c2sw3/aita_for_no_longer_wanting_to_share_a_bedroom/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was worse when we only had a one bedroom and she started sleeping on the couch. It made me feel like crap because I knew my snoring was the reason.

My partner snores and I have insomnia, and during the week we sleep separately. It doesn\u2019t mean we love each other less; it just means we have enough space in our home to both have sleep routines that work for us. \n\nThe key to sleeping separately though is to still have a routine together, so it doesn\u2019t feel like you are living separately.

That's messed up.", "Look, NAH, but while you\u2019re absolutely entitled to a good nights sleep, you can see this from his perspective right?

We have an air purifier in our bedroom that DH uses as white noise.  When we travel, we either take the small one with us, or if we stay in a hotel, he runs the fan all night as white noise.\n\n3.

However, if your husband continues to snore loudly, that\u2019s telling me he\u2019s not using his CPAP as directed. As you likely know, sleep apnea causes people to stop breathing. It\u2019s very dangerous if he is not using his CPAP every night. \n\nMy husband was diagnosed with sleep apnea years ago.

Neither one of us slept most of the night because every few minutes he made this horrible sound like he was gasping for air. I was terrified he would have a heart attack.\n\nHe was not allowed to use the CPAP until he had worn the testing equipment for six hours. As soon as the six hours was up, he put on the CPAP mask and we finally both slept. \n\nThe results showed he actually stopped breathing more than 60 times an hour.

He\u2019s had two surgical procedures to fix it and while it has done so it tends to revert. He definitely has sleep apnoea though I\u2019m sure of it so he\u2019s in the process of sleep studies. Being fairly remote it\u2019s hard to get into see our doctor and specialists are hard to get into as well. He has an ENT appointment mid 2024. He has a sleep study scheduled for the end of the month.", "Sleep depravation is one of the most painful thing, my husband had the same feeling when I started to be willing to sleep in the adjacent room, it took him sometime to realize my pain and how better I feel and I interact after a good night sleep. Hope you can give him enough proof of love to reassure him this is not the reason, willing a decent sleep is legitimate.", "My husband uses those nose bands that keep his nostrils wide.  No problems since then.  It was an easy fix for us.", "Yes we\u2019ve definitely talked about it. He\u2019s also a shift worker so him getting up at 3:30am some mornings and other mornings coming home at 6am and wanting a quiet bedroom adds to me wanting our own space.", "He is in the process of getting that done but we live fairly remotely so seeing a doctor and specialist takes time, and he has tried so many things I mean he has a UPPP surgery which was incredibly painful and a huge recovery and it did help for a number of years but lately it has gotten worse again. Im not offended by him not trying that option yet because I know he\u2019s in the process and he\u2019s tried other things. I want him to do that for his own health as well. In saying that he\u2019s a very fit healthy man so I know he\u2019s good health wise but the snoring and sleep apnoea is not good!", "The best advice is always communication. Personally, there's only 2 instances of couples I know that wanted to try sleeping separate and both ended up legally separated/divorced. Both cases involved the man being upset to not sleep with the wife and becoming irate. NTA but be careful", "I love that idea. Keeping routines the same (as much as you can with a shift worker. I am not going to bed at 8pm!).", "A happy marriage for him: he's entitled to have her lie in the same bed, sleepless due to his snoring, and clear out of the bedroom so he can sleep without interruptions from the kids. She doesn't get ininterrupted sleep so she's miserable.", "Care to elaborate? Getting enough sleep is very important.", "Yes definitely we are in the process of that. He has had sleep studies done in the past which said he didn\u2019t have sleep apnoea, so we went down surgical routes to fix it. He\u2019s had two surgical procedures to fix it and while it has done so it tends to eventually revert. He definitely has sleep apnoea though I\u2019m sure of it so he\u2019s in the process of sleep studies. Being fairly remote it\u2019s hard to get into see our doctor and specialists are hard to get into as well. He has an ENT appointment mid 2024. He has a sleep study scheduled for the end of the month. \n\nI did try to handle it as delicately as possible but every time we discuss it it ends up with him being not happy with the arrangement.", "Separate bedrooms for partners are totally underrated!", "Make sure when he does the study HE USES HIS PILLOWS, they could be throwing out the study. Also, maybe he should suggest he try different pillows at home. \n\nI'm just trying to think of ways the results might be different, think \"controlled lab environment\" vs. \"real life.\"\n\nI got used to my hubby's snoring, and life did get easier when he stopped working night shifts (im a light sleeper). Maybe try asking your hubby, how is it far that his sleep is more important than yours, you have to leave the room so he isn't disturbed but he is allowed to disturb you by snoring and getting in and out of bed at odd hours for work.\n\nMaybe try approaching this as a calm conversation about expectations regarding sleep and ask him how he would feel if he were in your shoes, if he says he wouldn't care then by all means, be petty and put him in your shoes.", "Of your husband really resists, I would point out to him that sleep deprivation is literally a form torture, and ask him why it is so important to him to continue subjecting you to torture. I would ask him why he doesn't want you to get enough sleep; what does he get out of it, and why is it more important than your health, happiness, and sanity.", "See, I\u2019m finding it a bit hypocritical of your husband to insist you vacate the bedroom on those 6am mornings so he can get undisturbed sleep but he seems unwilling to afford you the same courtesy when interrupting your sleep to either get up at 3am or with his snoring.\n\nHaving separate bedrooms because of her partner\u2019s incessant snoring and then sleep apnea machine is what saved the marriage of a good friend of mine. She was ready to leave after years of extremely poor sleep because of her partner\u2019s condition. Since they have separate bedrooms they\u2019re so much happier. They both sleep well and are rested and the resentment that builds up when you can\u2019t sleep because of your partner is gone. They are a lot closer now than they\u2019ve been for the ten years before.", "For sure.  And now you have your own rooms and the furniture for them.  He just has to use his.  If he\u2019s not going to do that he sflhould STFU.", "Ask him why he\u2019s so comfortable destroying your health by being the cause of your decades-long chronic sleep depravation. Sleep is the foundation of health - no exercise, diet, meditation, lifestyle choice will EVER make up for a lack of sleep. It is, frankly, unconscionable that you\u2019ve been subjected to this for two decades, (while also raising children!!). You shouldn\u2019t be asking if you can have separate bedrooms, you should be asking why you can\u2019t. Any answer that disregards your health is pure selfishness.", "That seems very promising! But if not, your husband is selfish.\nMy parents have been married over 40 years and around 10 years ago started sleeping in better rooms because one snores and the other has restles legs - they say they like each other much better now lol. Me & my dude have obviously been together much less time but even we sleep in different rooms now because he both keeps laying on my side and snores really loudly. He first whined when I wanted to sleep apart but when he saw the difference in me on days we slept together vs apart he's been the biggest advocate of it. Because he sees how much healthier happier and awake I am then.", "A friend of mine and her husband have separate bedrooms and their marriage is still going strong.", "It's surprising none of the top comments even remotely bring up his hypocrisy.", "Op literally says they\u2019ve had a \u201cvery happy marriage\u201d in the second sentence."]}
