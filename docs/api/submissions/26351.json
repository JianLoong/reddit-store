We have a handful of beautiful children and for the most part have a very happy marriage and life together. We are about to move into our dream home, it has enough space for all of us to have our own bedrooms and I have asked that my husband and I move into separate bedrooms when we move there. My husband is very offended by this request but the thing is my husband is a snorer. A terrible terrible snorer. He also has sleep apnoea and I just do not get any sleep. It is so loud I honestly don\u2019t think I can go on like this anymore I\u2019m so tired it\u2019s been decades. I\u2019ve tried ear plugs I\u2019ve bought a headband with music playing headphones. He\u2019s even had surgery to try and fix it. But the nights I sleep the best are the nights he works and it\u2019s a huge noticeable difference when he\u2019s back. \n\nI don\u2019t want to upset him I just feel so much happier and healthier and less stressed when I get a good nights sleep and those nights are the nights when he\u2019s not in the bed. \n\nI don\u2019t want to upset him but I really really want my own space. He thinks this is me taking the first step of leaving him but it is genuinely me wanting regular consistent sleep patterns. \n\nSo AITA? Do married people really need to share a bed?\n\nEDIT: just to answer a couple of questions: \n\n1. He is in the process of sleep studies for the sleep apnoea. He previously had a polyp removal which helped for a short period of time and then a full UPPP surgery that also helped for a period of time. It tends to revert back though so we are now exploring possible revision of the polyps and getting sleep studies done for sleep apnoea. He has had sleep studies done in the past but those said he didn\u2019t have sleep apnoea so we went down surgical routes. But I\u2019m certain he has it so we are exploring that now again. Living fairly remotely means that getting in to see doctors and specialists takes time. He can\u2019t see an ENT until mid next year (it\u2019s crazy I know!). \n\n2. I have definitely explained to him the reasons behind wanting separate rooms. He is also a shift worker so our sleep schedules are often very different. He gets up at 3:30am to leave some mornings and other days he\u2019s returning home at 6am. The mornings he comes home at 6am I\u2019m expected to vacate the bedroom when he goes to bed so I don\u2019t disturb him as the children will often come in and out for cuddles and chats and whatnot. This is especially difficult on weekends as I do enjoy a good sleep in and the kids are old enough to let me do that. I am not a morning person so I don\u2019t care for this option! \n\nI hope that helps a bit!", "created_utc": 1694050871, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16c2sw3/aita_for_no_longer_wanting_to_share_a_bedroom/", "score": 253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was worse when we only had a one bedroom and she started sleeping on the couch. It made me feel like crap because I knew my snoring was the reason.

My partner snores and I have insomnia, and during the week we sleep separately. It doesn\u2019t mean we love each other less; it just means we have enough space in our home to both have sleep routines that work for us. \n\nThe key to sleeping separately though is to still have a routine together, so it doesn\u2019t feel like you are living separately.

That's messed up.", "Look, NAH, but while you\u2019re absolutely entitled to a good nights sleep, you can see this from his perspective right?

We have an air purifier in our bedroom that DH uses as white noise.  When we travel, we either take the small one with us, or if we stay in a hotel, he runs the fan all night as white noise.\n\n3.

However, if your husband continues to snore loudly, that\u2019s telling me he\u2019s not using his CPAP as directed. As you likely know, sleep apnea causes people to stop breathing. It\u2019s very dangerous if he is not using his CPAP every night. \n\nMy husband was diagnosed with sleep apnea years ago.

Neither one of us slept most of the night because every few minutes he made this horrible sound like he was gasping for air. I was terrified he would have a heart attack.\n\nHe was not allowed to use the CPAP until he had worn the testing equipment for six hours. As soon as the six hours was up, he put on the CPAP mask and we finally both slept. \n\nThe results showed he actually stopped breathing more than 60 times an hour.

We still \"sleep together\" but one of us gets up after and lets the other keep the bed. Sometimes I'll sleep with her if she wants snuggles, but again, i typically leave once she is asleep.\n\nBonus point: I'm in Healthcare and on-call one week a month. I sleep in the basement so that my pager doesn't wake her when i get paged.", "Honestly, NAH.\n\nYour husband is obviously a bit offended as, even if he knows that it bothers you and cant sleep well, he has done a lot to try to make it work with all the surgeries and more, not wanting that to ruin a private time between the two of you, where you are alone and just enjoying the opportunity to just together.", "NTA. I have fa.ily members with sleep apnea and they got a breathing machine at night and the snoring is nonexistent now. Maybe that's an option to explore?", "I think maybe a compromise could be separate rooms then on the nights he leaves for work or gets home from work at odd hours? If it\u2019s not too bad on the other nights? But it would at least help you guys get adjusted to the change you want to bring to him and might help reassure his worries of leaving him", "NTA\n\n1. This is more common than your husband may realize. It is not a sign of an unhealthy marriage but of two people giving each other the sleep environment they need to be well rested and healthy.\n2. Your reasons are ALL about your health and well-being. You are likely to have a much shorter lifespan if you do not get the rest you need. Would he rather have you spend more time in the same room with him right now, only to not have you in his life at all in a few more years?\n3. He already makes you vacate the room for HIS sleep. But he's going to complain that you want a space where you can sleep undisturbed!!!! Um, selfish much?\n4. People who sleep in separate room can still have their 'together time' when and as often as they did in one room, probably more often/under better circumstances when both people are well rested.\n5. Offer to go to counseling with him about this - to help him express why he doesn't want you to have your own place to sleep well; why that matters more to him than your health and well-being. And for him to understand what this means to you; why you need it; what it doesn't mean about your marriage... And to hopefully put you back together on as partners looking out for each other's well-being.", "The fact that his sleep is sooo important to him she gets kicked out of the bedroom at 6am when he gets home from work - but he has absolutely no regard for her sleep shows that his modivations here are selfish.  He doesn't get to decide his sleep is important and hers is not.  He's probably worried he will get less sex, but if she is well rested then he will probably get more.", "Not everyone can tolerate a CPAP and I think only the rarer kind, central sleep apnea, can be fatal. He should definitely get on treatment though, and it sounds like that's in the works.", "Yes! I\u2019ve always hated it. It happens less often these days as my youngest will often come into my bed when he\u2019s not home so her bed is vacant in the mornings. He will go sleep there. But if that doesn\u2019t happen it\u2019s always been expected that I move on. Living with a shift worker definitely has its downsides.", "Living with a shift worker sucks! My life has been about protecting his sleep, making sure the kids are quiet when he\u2019s sleeping post night shift, making sure I get up when he comes home early so he can get sleep before he goes back to work. But there\u2019s no trade off really! When we have more space he will definitely be moving into his own room for after night shifts so I don\u2019t have to leave the bedroom when he gets home, especially on weekends!", "Totally! I think that\u2019s how we will do it. Or do it during the time he\u2019s working shifts so we aren\u2019t disturbing each others sleep as much. I guess reflecting on it all by writing it all out the issues definitely run deeper than just his snoring. His shift work plays a huge role in all of it as well. Not just the weird hours but he\u2019s much more tired after he\u2019s finished his rotation and he snores a lot during that time.", "Absolute rubbish. She can't sleep, she's said so in her OP, she's tried methods too and still can't sleep, telling her she's an asshole for not lying awake all night next to her husband is nasty as fuck. Did you by any chance read her update where she says her husband expects her to leave the room if his sleep is going to be disturbed? fuck me", "Yes! 100% feel this. I am definitely part of the problem too. He\u2019s done a lot to manage the problem. I\u2019ve also done a lot to manage the problem. It\u2019s just a problem that doesn\u2019t seem to have a resolution really. Maybe we have separate rooms during peak snoring periods (while he\u2019s on his shift rotation is particularly bad and the start of spring when his allergies flare up) and he can have a sleepover other times.", "Haha that\u2019s a hard pass. Mostly because he\u2019s the shift worker, I have young children who still like to wake up at night and I have a sleep walker who likes to try and leave the house in the middle of the night, so if I\u2019m not where they expect me to be that could create chaos. It\u2019s a lovely room he\u2019s getting. Has its own ensuite and everything!", "I\u2019m definitely open to being the AH but I\u2019d love some more info on why you think so.", "Oh I whack him so many times. He\u2019s unrousable!", "I\u2019m not in the USA \ud83d\ude0a", "How crazy! My husband has never had Covid. Even when I had Covid he somehow managed to avoid it.", "Me and my husband have slept apart for the majority of our time together. Reason being is once we had children I didn\u2019t want them to wake him so we slept in the livingroom mostly (for chair to nurse in) and then I slept in the kids\u2019 bedroom, we are at a point where I don\u2019t need to sleep with the children once they fall asleep, but we also have an elderly dog that wants to sleep with me, so mattress on the floor is safest for them. I will someday sleep in the same bed as him again, but I don\u2019t think it has created any problems. If anything it is nicer for both of us because we can each watch our own shows as we wind down for the night. (Granted I will often times fall asleep watching a kids show, but whatever).lol", "Best of luck to him", "I got a CPAP machine over the Internet. It's easy. \n\nYou go to one of the major sites, there's a few of them. They send you a test at home kit. You test, you get a prescription,  they sell you a machine. Easy peazy. \n\nMy wife was hitting a breaking point with my snoring, now she says I barely make a peep. I feel better too. He should try it.", "My husband got a CPAP because I suggested separate bedrooms. It helped enormously and he hardly snores at all now.\n\nHim knowing I was going to sleep elsewhere unless we got it sorted, motivated him to stick it out through the learning process of using the machine, which is genuinely a bit of a faff (they need a bit of emotional support though this process too). Now hubby can\u2019t sleep without his machine and likes how much better it makes him feel - we even take it camping!", "My dad was always a shift worker (and a grumpy ethnic man who would say things like \"cause i said so\" lol) and while we were considerate we were not slaves to his selfishness. He recognized we had to live and sleep. Something to think about.", "Oh no! The only solution is to not vacate when he comes back :(\n\nBut also there's nothing wrong with sleeping in separate rooms. I need to hog the sheets and sleep as a starfish for that comfort.", "Yeah, I have friends my age (mid 30s) who sleep in separate bedrooms because one partner snores. They seem totally happy with this arrangement and managed to have a baby girl this year so they're obviously doing fine relationship-wise!", "That\u2019s so good to know thank you! I\u2019ve been telling him he needs a new pillow for years now that you mention it.  I wonder if that\u2019s affecting his sleep.", "Also if he normally has a few drinks with dinner or  before bed, he needs to do that for her test too. My husband snores like a beast - so loud and impossible to sleep through - but he did a sleep study and didn't replicate his normal alcohol consumption and apparently didn't snore! I wish I'd gone there with him to make sure the test came close to replicating real life.", "I agree. I recorded my now-ex husband snoring and gasping. He did acknowledge that it was very loud, but did absolutely nothing about it. Lack of sleep has been used as a torture method, and causes a great risk of falling asleep at the wheel. NTA", "Any recommendations for these sites? I kinda need one but really don't like the idea of having to go do a sleep study in person", "I went a few nights w/o my CPAP and could hardly stay awake at work. Went back to CPAP and was noticeably less tired.", "That's still not someone I know.", "This is like me and my husband: mid 30s, kids, vastly different sleep needs. We appreciate each other more when we sleep in separate bedrooms and actually get restful sleep.", "In the meantime consider having him use an app called SnoreLab and its partner app SnoreGym. It records you overnight and, by comparing the snoring over different nights with different remedies, helps you figure out potential solutions. For me, I found out that drinking alcohol at night made it worse and taping my mouth shut made it almost go away. I also use SnoreGym which has mouth/palate strengthening exercises. It's SO much less invasive than surgery or a CPAP.", "My hubby has a memory foam one that is contoured like this\nhttps://www.canningvale.com/contour-memory-foam-pillow-twin-pack/?gclid=CjwKCAjw6eWnBhAKEiwADpnw9jMZLtBnuV8U9WUS3rAfICJDSWlS7Ps7hbn1EOA8nUuInegBF26VVBoCMEoQAvD_BwE\nAnd he has said it helps his neck when he is on his back but I have noticed it keeps his airways more open. Food for thought", "I got mine from https://cpapmyway.com and everything was easy. I bought a ResMed machine because A) It's one the most popular machines and B) My FIL had one and was very happy with it. It's the only CPAP I've ever had and I'm happy with it.", "Taping your mouth shut!?!", "It sounds weird but it's incredibly effective! I use half a band-aid. The book *Breath*  by James Nestor suggested it-- he argues for all the scientific evidence that it's better to breathe through your nose."]}
