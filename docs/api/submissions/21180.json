Not to sound mean; but you gotta finish school before people can take you seriously in something like medicine.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was a nurse and I would still rather hear from a doctor than a nurse.", "If anyone else had wanted to offer suggestions,  would you have cut them off?", "Even if she was a certified nurse already her opinion wouldn't beat that of your doctor as she is getting trained to assist a doctor instead of replacing him. I would ask her if she would be ok with it if someone dies because he relies on her medical advice instead of making a doctors appointment and getting diagnosed by someone who was trained for that task.\n\nSlight YTA for cutting her off, but it is at least understandable if she does this often.", "\"Hey sis. Sometimes I'm not in advice mode, so I can't take in what you want to tell me. It might be more helpful to me to talk with you about it after I've been to the doctor. Doctors know what doctors know, and your training might be really useful in helping me evaluate they they say and/or maybe explain it better. Let's wait til then.\"\n\nThat was too wordy, but you get the point. Maybe you don't want to hear her opinion at all, for emotional reasons, but that's another matter. In that case, you're going to have to tell her not to advise unless asked, and then not ask. That's a tougher thing to not be in conflict over. \n\nI'd say mild AH on your part, but mostly because you were abrupt, partly because you haven't figured out a strategy for this. Do that and you'll feel better. \n\nShe's the AH because she is a fucking nursing *student* and not a medical diagnostician. She's also intruding. No one should give advice on any subject without being asked. She's trying to impress you, I guess, and can't see that you're alienated by what she's doing.", "This sounds like a ESH situation. \n\nYou accuse your sister of sibling bias and say she doesn't listen to all the facts.\n\nOn the other hand, you are guilty of sibling bias and don't/won't ask your sister for help, knowing full well that she is training to be a nurse. Sure, she won't be a doctor at the end of her training, but she will still be learning a lot about symptoms and treatment.\n\nI do think you are the bigger TA, because you could ask for help and explain your symptoms. You could show her you sleep data. She could give advice and you could take it.\n\nYou basically have free medical advice on tap and you are refusing to use it because 'sisterly rivalry'.", "NTA. You are correct on making an appointment with your doctor. Becky is not even certificated to diagnose you with something if she thinks what you are going through without hearing your facts.", "\u201cSeek first to understand, then to be understood\u201d - Steven Covey\n\nA good medical professional probes and questions before giving a diagnosis.

It is infuriating.", "No, but she'd probably be different to other people. Let's say the neighbor asks for an opinion. Becky would probably take the time to understand the neighbor's situation first before giving an opinion. She'd probably remind the neighbor to also speak with a doctor since Becky isn't one herself.\n\nWith me, it's different since Becky thinks she already knows all the facts.", "Hm no I think it was okay to cut her off. Little harsh, but not too harsh for that situation. She does that all the time.\nAlso OP just told her to stop giving advice before she knows the facts. The sister didn't have any more information than that OP has headaches. You can't give advice with that little information. So why listen to unnecessary advice? Cutting her off was totally fine as she didn't know the situation anyways and always does this. It's good that OP told her.\n\nI understand the sisters excitement about using the new things she learned to help people. \nIt's still important to tell her to get all the facts first before \"helping\" :)", "No one likes a know-it-all.  That being said, having not directly observed the conversation,  it sounds like you didn't give her a chance to even speak, which I thought was a little rude. Clearly, you were questioning, too, since you posted on reddit. After careful consideration,  this redditors judgment is (pause for dramatic effect)...\n\nNTA, but you could have been more diplomatic. \n\nThe end.", "> You can't give advice with that little information. So why listen to unnecessary advice?\n\nYes, that's it. It's always been frustrating when she's done this in the past. So this time, I cut her off before she could share her uninformed opinion."]}
