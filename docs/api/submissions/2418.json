Not worth fighting or acknowledging", "NTA. Based on their response, you very clearly made the right decision. Cut contact with everyone except your dad, assuming he's still standing up for you", "NTA.\n\nFor all they know, you changed your mind at the last minute.  Block them.  Ignore them.  Thank them for their opinion and give it no mind.  Don't give them a reaction as then they will keep doing what they're doing.  No reaction generally leads to diminished attacks after they learn they won't get the response they want.", "NTA, the fact that your phone blew up tells you everything you need to know.\n\nAnd how exactly did they \"find out\" you didn't move to Atlanta?  Did they hire a private detective?", "Nope! Fly free, little birdie!", "Guys, thank you all so much, this has been a rough morning for me and all of this positive reinforcement has really helped me realize I made the right decision, I love all of you lovely internet people.", "NTA. Sounds like they confirmed you made the right decision when they belittled you about not being honest about it", "Nah you have a right to privacy I would just say cut them off", "NTA\n\nSend them a photo of you smiling in your happy life.\n\nYou haven't hurt them, quite the opposite. \n\nIf they can't be happy for you, then block them.", "NTA, live your life and don't worry about them. I haven't spoken with anyone in my family for years and it's been wonderful. Wish them all the happiness they wish on you and just let them talk. Cause they will. Best of luck to you.", "NTA - It\\`s your choice where you go and what you yell them. You\\`re an adult and capable of doing what\\`s in your best interests. Screw them.", "NTA\n\nGet a new phone number. Cut them out for good.", "NTA: I'm about to move out of my apartment and one of my current roommates is my covert narcissistic ex who I dated for a year and a half. \n\nI've lied to him about where I'm moving.  Why?  Because fuck him.  I don't want him to know.  I don't want his criticism, his input, any part of his energy to taint my safe space because I'm entitled to that.  You're entitled to that too.  \n\nEveryone is.", "NTA - he literally gave the reason why you moved away without telling them the correct place. He and the rest of your toxic family can f all way off. Block them all and live your life.", "NTA.  You moved and have been \"incredibly happy.\"  What more do you need to know? You laid down a false trail for a reason, so stay loyal to yourself.\n\nBlock those people and go find your life where you are.  Unfortunately, your biological family are not good people.  Go find your family where you are... people you vibe with, those folks you can talk to and appreciate - and they will appreciate you.\n\nGo where you are happy and extinguish any unhappiness behind you.", "NTA I was raised by incredibly toxic people and at 18 I made myself a promise to never deal with the stress and drama of it anymore, or allow more toxic people in to replace them. Unfortunately, my narcissistic mother completely sabotaged my college application and I had to conceal and hide everything from her to get in the following year, so I had to delay my escape until 19. But I never regretted getting away and forging my own life. Happiness should be pursued. Validation comes from the satisfaction you get from doing things yourself and not from recognition by family. Some people can never be pleased. Just block their numbers and give them no info.", "NTA  I divorced my family.  Best decision ever.  They tried to track me down, so I hid and moved to SoCal too.", "NTA\n\nYour choice.", "I don't understand. What is the difference between saying you moved to Atlanta or LA? They are both big cities in the USA", "NTA. Your family showed you who they were a long time ago.

Block them :)\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThough I think you should have just said you were moving and refused to disclose your new location, but that still doesn't make you an AH.  You did it to escape people you describe as \"incredibly toxic\" so you had your legitimate reasons for it. \n\nBut it doesn't seem it did much good.  Who spilled the beans?  Your dad?", "NTA. Hell no, you're not the asshole. Block them all.", "NTA, what are they disappointed about?", "NTA.  And you still wouldn't be the AH if you block every last one of their asses.", "NTA just go completely no contact. Then you can move on and forget this bullshit.", "NTA!!!!\n\nI've been living the secret place for almost a year now. Very few people know where I live, and I love it.

Toxic is toxic and needs to be removed, even if family.", "NTA.", "NTA. Blocking is the easy way, but it's smarter to change your phone number and then block their numbers just in case.

If your so certain of your choice to move it seems to unnecessarily invite drama to make up a story for absolutely no reason, then complain that they're upset that you lied!"]}
