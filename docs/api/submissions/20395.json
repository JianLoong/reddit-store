You made it clear that if you were going to do this child watching that you would be taking him along in the mornings to do errands.

They have the option to make other arrangements if they see fit.", "I grew up being taken along on errands with my mom.  She always said \"bring a book\".\n\nHe is 8, he can bring things to do.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you said you're getting paid but setting the terms of a job you're willing to take is fine. You had let them know this previously, and if it doesn't work for them they should find someone who is willing to stay at their house instead.", "NTA. \n\nKids have to learn some patience at some point. Life isn't a circus of entertainment. You have things to do. She can get someone else if it is not something she's willing to compromise on.", "NTA If they want a babysitter who will just play with him, then they need to find a different one who doesn't have errands to run Saturday morning.", "NTA\n\nIf they didn't like this they should make other arrangements. You are entitled to have a life and take care of your needs.", "Nta tell your sister if she doesn\u2019t like what you do with her kid when you\u2019re babysitting she can find someone else to watch him", "NTA. It's normal for kids to go out for errands with adults. If he nerd fun 24/7, then she needs to send him to summer camp instead.", "NTA. You're not being unreasonable at all. They know the situation. Your nephew may be bored running errands now but he'll get into routine with you and figure out how to occupy himself. Kids are pretty good at adjusting and figuring out how not to be bored when not given other options. I think it's pretty unreasonable for your sister to ask you to not run errands with her son so that he can sit in front of the television instead.", "NTA. My guess is they are paying a discounted rate for you to do this rather than paying a true babysitter. Perhaps not and they just don\u2019t feel comfortable with strangers, but if that\u2019s the case then she needs to understand even paid this is still a favor to her.", "NTA. If she has a problem, then she needs to find someone else to watch your nephew. Beggars can't be choosers.", "NTA if you are busy then they shouldn't expect you to take care of your nephew. They should just hire a babysitter", "NTA Your sister and brother in law have two choices, leave their son with you while they work on Saturdays and he tags along while you run your errands or hire a sitter. If they are unhappy with your son tagging along while you run your errands, they can hire a sitter.", "NTA. You have things to do and sitting home all day with a kid would be incredibly boring. They are happy with you being bored, but not their kid.", "NTA\n\nYou work 50 hours a week and most places are closed on Sunday. Saturday is literally your only day to do errands. If your town is anything like mine, a lot of places close early on Saturdays, so going after your nephew is picked up isn't an option. Tell your sister she's the one being unreasonable.", "NTA. \nKids need to learn how to be bored. Life isn\u2019t entertainment 24/7 and sometimes you have to do nothing or do boring things.", "NTA .", "NTA. You set the terms and they agreed to it. May I ask why rain would be so much of an issue that they are asking you to stay home? \n\nAlso bringing kids in what they perceive as boring helps them develop patience, as well as creativity. Its good training for the kid. The fact that you try to add other activities after running errands also shows that you also want your nephew to have fun while hanging out with you.", "NTA\n\nAssuming you've been clear with them as you've said about what your version of child care would be like, they have a choice to either continue to use you or find someone else. Continuing to use you knowing that and expecting you to modify your life regardless of being paid or not is an unreasonable ask.", "NTA. Can\u2019t they find another trustworthy, long-term babysitter though?", "My mom dragged me everywhere as a kid. It wasn't fun.

If they don\u2019t like it they can find another babysitter.", "NTA\nIf they are unhappy with your help, why don\u2019t they get another babysitter?", "NTA\n\nJust as a possible solution, maybe involve him in planning or executing the errands. He might be kid glued to screens but when I would watch some kids on the weekend they were excited to run around the store and pick up my groceries. They also helped plan my meals and make a grocery list. They were good kids though and happy to get out of the house. TBF though, their parents were hippies who didn't have a TV. \n\nKids just want to be part of our lives generally.", "You may want to get your nephew engaged in the errands if possible. Give him part of the shopping list and let him find items and pick out produce. He can learn to read use by dates etc.\n\nNTA by the way.", "NTA  It has actually been shown that some boredom is necessary for kids to develop creativity and the ability to entertain themselves.", "NTA\n\nAn 8 year old can come along on errands. His being safe and supervised is a reasonable expectation. His being catered to and constantly entertained is not necessary. I'm kind of surprised he can't find interesting sights and situations when he's out and about with you. \n\nYou are doing a favor including your nephew in your Saturday activities so his parents are free to work. He is safe and supervised. You're being paid for taking on their parental duty to supervise their child. That does not create an obligation that your normal life tasks be outside of that time frame. You have agreed to appropriately supervise your nephew, not sell your autonomy and independence. You are not his tutor or private nanny.", "NTA if she doesn\u2019t like it she can get another sitter. Good Lord the entitlement.", "NTA. This is your offer. If it is not good enough for them, they can hire a babysitter.", "NTA, but that means your sister and BIL probably need to find another sitter or maybe have him join a group on Saturdays like the Boy Scouts. That way you could run your errands while he's in the Boy Scouts/Karate Club or activity of his choice...", "Nta, he\u2019s 8, he can watch cartoons on his iPad, can\u2019t he?", "Wow! So NTA!\n\nI remember watching a friend\u2019s child. We went on errands together and they said, \u201cthis is boring.\u201d\n\nI said sometimes that\u2019s just how it is - lots of life is boring.", "NTA. In what universe is a kid watching TV more important than an adult taking care of important matters? You're babysitting, not running some sort of entertainment service.", "NTA  \n\nOne you made it known up front \n\nTwo it won't kill him\n\nThree you're doing them a favor it's not like you run a professional daycare and taking the kids on errands", "NTA, 8 is old enough that it shouldn't be a big deal.", "It's not hard to make grocery shopping interesting for an eight-year-old if they are enlisted to help and not just left to trail along behind you. Talking to them, sharing info, asking them to calculate, read aloud and search for things - even with an i-pad, all stimulates them. They like the interaction as they get some attention instead of plonking them in front of a TV. 8 years olds have thoughts and feelings, so talk about your nephew's thoughts and interests over the Burger King lunch -  it doesn't have to be a compromise for either of you.", "YTA\n\nIf you can't watch the kid, then you should just politely decline and they can find a different sitter. Lugging the kid around with you to do errands (and it seems you are pretty inflexible on this) is not really fair to the kid. It's a paid position, not a kindness of your heart position. This means that the child-attending to is the bulk of your responsibility, you don't run errands while working your primary job, so you shouldn't be running errands at your \"secondary\" job. It just seems like the line between family/employer is getting a bit muddied here. Just suggest they find somebody else.\n\nYour sister may also be the asshole if she refuses to look for anybody else, but the kid is the one that is suffering here. It's one thing if it's every so often you have to run a quick errand, but it sounds like that's the bulk of the experience any time he's with you.\n\nThe reason I see \"YTA\" is not necessarily in relation to the conduct with the Sister, but with the conduct to your nephew, who is getting a really raw deal. My guess here is the communication sucks, as it's not clear what \"your conditions\" as an independent contractor are versus your \"sister's conditions\" of employment. Sister sounds like she may be a bit of a pushover, who is willing to let you accept the job without you understanding her \"conditions of employment\" because you are family.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
