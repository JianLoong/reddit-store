So last year I started offering him a Reese's peanut butter cup or two if he'd help pack the produce--just to get him over the hump, because I wanted him to learn how to work and also how not to hate it. He's still reluctant sometimes--but that Reese's gets him over it--and invariably once he gets going he enjoys himself a lot and even says so.

It isn't fair to the boy, but you're not the one not being unfair. Sis and BIL aren't being fair to you, either.", "NTA. I take my daughter 6 out running errands all the time, yeah sometimes it's boring, but it's also when we really talk (as much as you can with a 6 yo), I find out her likes, she points out interesting things, she asks amazing questions, I also involve her in my errands and give her jobs to do for treats later.  Your nephew is 8, I am sure you could make this a great bonding/learning experience for both of you.", "NTA. You still have a life and stuff to do. Like you said, they can find different arrangements if they don\u2019t like it.", "Nta. He is 8, he should be able to a handle a few hours of running errands.  If they want him to just hangout and watch cartoons, they can make other arrangements.", "You can't let an 8 year old loose in a store anymore because of preditors.", "I like the grocery shopping participation. Especially if he starts learning about budgeting this way - ask him to keep a running total of the food costs, comment about prices of eggs, etc. \n\nNot teaching practical budgeting is a horrendous failure that sets up young adults for early failures.", "It's super normal here in the US as well, complete with kids shopping carts.", "THIS.\nI\u2019m 31 now, but I was homeschooled with my older sister all through school. We socialized by going places with our mom throughout the week. It also socialized us with adults more. So when we interacted with friends\u2019 parents, we knew how to be respectful and how to carry ourselves.", "I see. The second set is probably what you hear more about in the news. I live in a country where homeschooling is illegal, so I'm not familiar with the details. \nI think it has pros and cons. My kids actually loved the school lockdown. They got better grades and had more time to do creative things as well, but it also was a bit lonely. But that was mainly due to the lockdown.", "Yep. It\u2019s not for everyone - which is fine! It definitely has pros and cons. There\u2019s a lot of freedom but also a lot of responsibility. Assuming your goal is to raise functional adults, not obedient clones."]}
