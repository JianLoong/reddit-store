Honestly it sounds like it\u2019s so their kid some good to get away from technology and get outside.", "INFO: How long does it take you to run errands? I mean he is eight. If his parents leave at 8 and you would be finished and come in at 9:30 or 10 would that not be a good oportunity to teach him to stay home alone for one or two hours?", "NTA", "NTA - he's 8, he can deal with being bored for a couple of hours. You did fun stuff in the afternoon, too.", "NTA you told them the deal when they asked you to babysit. If they don\u2019t like it, they are free to make alternative arrangements.  If this was your own child he/she would be accompanying you doing your errands, it\u2019s no different with a nephew.", "10/10", "NTA. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with running your errands with thisnkid. Parents have to run errends with their kids all the time. I know i do. Yeh, kids dont enjoy it but... responsibilities are responsibilities!", "For real! We went to look at model homes", "Yeah, same. Looking back, I learned a lot about navigating grocery stores, checking produce, looking for sales, etc. Good life skills, but boring af. It's not going to hurt him regardless.", "Yeeeep. I was always reading or playing on my DS. Kids need to learn how to entertain themselves.", "also probably pay more :)", "Next time, read the article, sweetie. If you\u2019re going to be dismissive, be correct.\n\nOP took nephew to run errands last time and he was bored, sister wants OP to run her errands after watching the nephew, when most stores might be closed for the rest of the weekend.", "Get some glasses and read the post again.", "8 years old is old enough to tag along on boring errands. \n\nYou provided some entertainment and a meal, A safe place and company. Not every Saturday can be a lazy one. These days shows are streaming or can be saved in some way. Or if on cable, don\u2019t the shows repeat? \n\nI feel like being dragged along on errands is a good way to learn how to deal with the world outside of home. Would he be interested in \u201chelping\u201d you with anything? Is there a way he can be involved a little more? Maybe if he decides which errand to run first or pick a place for lunch?", "It shouldn\u2019t matter. Even if those places were open 24/7, you prefer to have things done in the morning. And he\u2019s 8. Does he not go with his parents to run errands? It\u2019s a great way for kids to spend time with parents, but also to learn about responsibility, to be more active in their household (helping choose foods for the week, etc), and even a little money management. Errands aren\u2019t going to kill him and neither will a little boredom. And as a bonus, he\u2019s learning that if chores are completed early, fun can happen for most of the rest of the day. NTA.", "You are working 50 hours a week. That's a lot. I find your sister extremely entitled - on top of this, you should drop everything for her son? No. You are being very reasonable. It's already nice that you are spending the afternoon with him. NTA. I would be super thankful to have a sister like you!", "Same. Like, yeah, it was always excruciatingly boring (though that was in part because it was in the days before smartphones) but doing excruciatingly boring stuff is just part of life and kids should count themselves lucky that we have handheld computers they can entertain themselves with now.", "OMG the flashbacks of looking at model homes!", "[removed]", "Having been in various living/shared cooking arrangements with people whose parents apparently didn\u2019t bring them alone for grocery shopping, it really is a critical life skill! Otherwise you end up with six zuchinnis to feed two people, and half of the other produce is going bad because they didn\u2019t know they should check. Taking kids along on errands sometimes is a really good idea.", "She is still doing a favor, and is allowed to have conditions. The sister needs to find someone else, if she doesn't like the conditions. \n\nNTA", "Still doing a favour even if she\u2019s getting paid, are you the sister?", "I highly doubt they're paying as much as a professional/non-relative would charge otherwise they'd simply do that. Maybe I'm wrong but this seems like a favour with a bit of cash to help mitigate inconvenience.", "By the time I was 8, my mom would give me my own shopping list at the supermarket. It was all stuff that didn't need a judgement call--milk and eggs and bread and butter and canned goods and things like that. She taught me how to load the shopping cart with the milk first, and the bread last, so it didn't get squished. \n\nEven if OP keeps her nephew with her, he can still run and retrieve things and help the shopping go faster, so he gets to relax faster.

I would go with my Mom or grandfather on all their errands when I was a tot. I made the best of it all, because things had to be done. I even spent time at their work and that was really exciting being quiet as a mouse. I've dragged my kid (now 20) on my errands and still sometimes do.\n\nSo, I'm not getting the issue. Is the kid supposed to be super protected where they never get exposed to others? Is every minute supposed to be planned so the kid doesn't get bored? Is life supposed to revolve around a kid? \n\nI wish I could have had lazy days where I didn't need to leave the house. My kid probably felt the same. However, we both grew up knowing that life doesn't always work that way. Sometimes you just have to deal with the boring stuff.", "My kids have gotten used to full days of errands because we live out of town. We have a 30+ minute drive each day and it sucks but they don't complain anymore(much, they're kids). The biggest thing that triggers the whining is not knowing where we're going/how many errands. So we tell them in advance each place we're going and roughly how long it'll take. Things change sometimes of course, but if they have  an idea of how many places we're going they feel better, as opposed to just saying \"we're going into town to run errands\"", "Hell, if you head over to r/Nanny (which is always in my feed for some reason, despite not being a nanny or employing one), some parents ask their nannies to take their kids on errands as a learning experience. Deal with new sights/sounds/people. Learn how the world works. Put some basic math and reading skills to use. Etc. It can genuinely be a pretty enriching experience. \n\nPlus, it\u2019s good for kids to be a little bored sometimes. They have to learn to self entertain, self motivate, and self soothe at some point.", "[removed]", "Entitled people raise entitled kids.", "I loved the kids rooms with the murals!", "Bad bot! Don\u2019t steal comments!", "Yes it's still a favour. They won't have to spend ages vetting babysitters and blah blah.

Give him something to do at each errand so he learns.\n\n At the grocery store his own list and include letting him pick out something for himself. \n\n If you take him to the bank, maybe have his parents open a savings account to start a college fund. \n\nMaybe let him do a few small chores around your home (with parental permission ofc) to earn money to put in the savings account.  \n\nI wish I'd done more things like this when I was that age.  \n\nNTA", "When I was 8 (grade 3),my teacher actually set up a \"store\" in the classroom using empty packaging for a math unit. We learned how to grocery shop, write cheques and fill out bank withdrawal slips to get fake cash if we wanted to pay that way, which also taught us how to count money and make change.\n\nThis was in 1992 so cheques and withdrawal slips are a bit outdated now but I still remember how much fun that was and then my mom let me help at the grocery store which made me feel so grown up.", "Bot", "Kinda funny another bot responded to this very comment XD", "We can infer from available information. Why involve a reluctant family member if a professional would cost the same? The only logical answer is a professional is either unavailable or costs more than they're willing to pay."]}
