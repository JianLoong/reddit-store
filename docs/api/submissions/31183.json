Ask your dad to please get you a GOOD lock for your door, if nothing else to keep her (and the kids) out while you may be changing or otherwise inappropriate. While the lock is the most surefire way to protect your things, making it harder to damage anything will be a plus. Frame your posters. Get shadow boxes/display boxes for figures or other trinkets. A bonus is that if you ever have to move things (decorating dorm room, etc.) it makes it easier to move things safely since they will already be in a protected medium. If you get the chance to get your BIL\u2019s important documents away from her to get them to him, do it. The more you can get to him  (clothing, other personal effects) the better. If he has the means to dress well for a good job to have a good place to live, etc. the more likely that he will get at least decent custody (such as 50/50) for the kids.
