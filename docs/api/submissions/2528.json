He was married before dating me, and they had a daughter. His wife tragically passed when his little girl (let's call her Olivia) was 5. Two years later, Adam decided to start dating again. He and I started dating shortly after. I fell for him, but I loved Olivia even more. She was 7 when I met her, and she was apprehensive of me at first, she didn't want a new Mom, understandably. However, Olivia and I grew close very quickly. She and I did everything together. Although it was hard to suddenly have a kid to watch over, I loved her. I stayed up with her when she was sick, took her out for ice cream, celebrated birthdays with her, everything. When she was 9, she asked if she could call me her Mom, and I said yes. I love that girl with my whole self. I quickly fell out of love with Adam. Sadly, Adam he was not a great father, or partner. He got angry a lot, and one time when Olivia was 12, I had to lock her and I in a closet to get away from him. He was explosive. He screamed at Olivia over the smallest things. I had to step in all the time to help her. I wanted to leave him, but if I did, I would lose Olivia. She begged me to stay with her. \n\nIt just got worse Adam got more angry, and I ended up needing to take Olivia to my parents home with me for a few days until he calmed down on several different occasions. One time, Adam went so far as to try and hurt Olivia. I stopped him, and I called the police. When they got there, Adam made some big scene about how I was overreacting. Olivia even told them what he tried to do, but nothing came of it.\n\nOnce she turned 14 I told her that I wanted to leave Adam and take her with me. She told me she would give anything to leave her Dad and stay with me. I never got to do that though, because Adam broke up with me a month later. He had been cheating on me and wanted to stay with the other woman. Olivia was crushed. I was kicked out of his home and got an apartment. I visited Olivia every chance I got. She is begging me to take her with me, she says that it is unbearable at home, and nobody defends her when her Dad gets explosive.\n\nAdam recently banned me from seeing Olivia, but we still text and call and try and sneak out to see each other.\n\nMy family is urging me to try and get custody of her, but Adam's family says that I would be an AH, that he had already lost his wife, and to take his daughter would just be cruel. They told me that I was just her Dad's ex-girlfriend, and there is no way that I can get custody, as I am in no way legally Olivia's mother.\n\nI want to get custody of Olivia so badly, but I don't even know where to begin. I am, after all, just the Dad's ex.\n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1668656656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxfkhv/wibta_for_trying_to_get_custody_of_my_exs_kid/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP, I just want to say that I was once an Olivia, it\u2019s actually it\u2019s crazy how similar our lives are.

I would contact a lawyer.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think you have a chance of winning unfortunately.", "NTA. Please seek custody. I think you have a good shot of at minimum visitation. . With her age, and how long you\u2019ve been in her life plus the mental abuse.", "NTA. Kudos to you for loving Olivia as your own, and trying to get her away from Adam! I wish you all the best of luck.", "NTA - I would also see if the police had any kind of report on that incident.", "NTA.  If there is any way legally possible to do it, do it.

I have no idea if you have a legal leg to stand on but I hope you succeed for both your sakes!!", "NTA but legally his family is most likely correct when they say an ex-girlfriend can\u2019t get custody. Best you can do is call CPS and report the abuse. She probably won\u2019t end up with you, but it\u2019ll get her away from him which is the more urgent issue.", "YWNBTA. Bro lost his wife and is about to lose even his daughter and he deserves it. He was the one who made himself lose Olivia, not you. Please fight for the child, you are her hope and family, tied by blood or not.", "YTA - he is the biological parent and you say he can get angry sometimes.  You would need to prove extraordinary circumstances.  Based on your post, I don\u2019t see it.  I don\u2019t know what you mean when you say he tried to hurt her, but a single police encounter without an arrest is nowhere near extraordinary circumstances.  Obviously contact a lawyer in your area but as a lawyer, I find it highly unlikely.  Given that it is unlikely, I find it extremely inappropriate that you have told his child about your custody plans, just to leave her feeling once again abandoned.", "NTA", "Definitely you will be NTA for trying. I agree with people saying call CPS and talk to a lawyer. Maybe you can become a foster parent and Olivia could be placed with you? I wish you luck and hopefully Olivia can be moved somewhere safe even if it can't be with you.", "Nta but you won't be able to you didn't adopt her your nothing more to her than her dad's ex girlfriend in the legal system meaning you have no legal rights to her", "NTA - You need to start getting a record of the abuse. I wonder if you could start by reporting the abuse to CPS (assuming that you\u2019re in the US). Olivia also might need to assist by calling the police when he gets violent. You would have a better chance of getting her if there was a documented history of the abuse", ">but Adam's family says that I would be an AH, that he had already lost his wife, and to take his daughter would just be cruel.\n\nAs opposed to leaving his daughter in an abusive situation - because that \"isn't\" cruel????  \n\n\nYou are NTA for wanting to help this girl get away from a horrific home life. I hope whatever course you take, she ends up with people who love and care for her properly. If that's you, even better.  \n\n\nBut you need to report this the authorities regardless. At her age, she has a very clear voice that any judge will consider when placing her - so you may very well find this in your favour.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nYou need to be talking to a lawyer and let them guide you. Asking for opinions here is pointless. \n\nYou have been serving as her parent for half of her life. You have documentation of abuse, not just that one time correct? \n\nTake all the documentation of abuse with you to the lawyer. \n\nYou will not get full custody of her for sure since you are not her legal parent. But it may get child services involved and they may grant you guardianship.", "NTA \n\nTalk to a lawyer and do what the law allows. You can also get CPS involved if the lawyer thinks that will help.", "NTA, at 14 she has a voice and should be heard. Obviously she's not old enough to take huge decisions alone, but it's important that someone fights for her.\n\nOne note though: her family is right, you're not legally her mother (even if the whole point is to eventually be), so if you two sneak out to see each other against the explicit will of her legal father this could have legal repercussions and jeopardize your claim. IANAL and laws varies between states but few places are ok with adults outside the family spending time with your kid against parent's approval.", "I don't know for sure, but if she got a good lawyer, they may be able to say since she has been her stepmother for seven years, it is in her best interest to stay with her former stepmother. Generally, relatives and family friends don't have to go through the same process to take the kids. I do agree that they would probably try to put her with blood relatives first, so the chances my be very low."]}
