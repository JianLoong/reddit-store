I am a 39 year old female and work as a nurse in the ER. My husband 40 male and I have been married for 16 years and have 3 children together. I have always completed the majority of the Christmas shopping since our oldest child (14 male) was born. This has been a non issue in the past as it makes more sense since I know majority of my children\u2019s likes and interests as I do a large amount of the household responsibilities, which is fine as my husband is very busy working in the marketing sector. This holiday season I have taken in an increase in shifts and have not had as much time as usual go complete holiday shopping. I have purchased and organised all the presents for my children, husband and each of our in laws etc. however have not bought stocking stuffers. My husband has decreased hours around the holidays and I asked if he could please go and buy the stocking gifts. These were all organised and he just needed to pick them up from their respective stores as I didn\u2019t want to risk them not arriving in time if I was to order online. I made time to go after a long shift to buy the gifts for my husbands stocking as to not spoil the surprise. It is also important to note that each year I have bought my own stocking stuffers otherwise it would be empty as it is not really my husband\u2019s thing. In the list I gave him I had my name written and a list of possible ideas for my gift. When I got home from work last night he told me that my joke was pretty funny. I asked what he was talking about and he said that it\u2019s not like I actually thought he would be filling my stocking as I am a grown woman and can get over myself and he\u2019s never done it before so why should he do it now. I was extremely tired and fractious after a very long shift and admittedly blew up at him to which he was in tears laughing. He asked how I could be serious about this and truly thought this was some big elaborate joke. I know that I could easily just buy my own things but honestly I\u2019m quite fed up so I think this is the hill that I will die on. When I expressed this frustration and disappointment to him this morning he said I was an asshole from asking that much from him and it was unreasonable and I was being childish. So am I the asshole because I completely understand that my blowing up at him was an overreaction but still think the actual situation was valid.", "created_utc": 1702728861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jq06b/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_fill_my_christmas/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, don\u2019t fill his stocking. Buy whatever you\u2019d like for yourself and fill yours. You are carrying more than your fair share of labor (emotional and physical) in your household. He got mad because you called him out, not because you were wrong. Instead of listening, he chose to minimize your feelings. For Christmas, you will no longer be questioning what your gut is saying. Your husband is doing just fine giving you the bare minimum. Instead, this Christmas, TREAT YO\u2019 SELF! Spend the budget for his gifts on yourself! Don\u2019t spend a dime on him.

If not, then don't bother doing one of those for him either.  \nHe won't be upset, he's a \"grown\" man, and Christmas is evidently just for the kids.\n\nNTA\n\nYou deserve better.

For the record, he is an asshole, and OP is not- but if he\u2019s like me then he will be perfectly happy not getting anything for Christmas because that means he doesn\u2019t have to pretend to like it, and doesn\u2019t have to feel bad for not getting her anything.  I\u2019m not saying that he should be therefore entitled to a gift, stocking stuffers, etc.  I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the \u2018gotcha\u2019 you might think it is.", "NTA. I would be so angry at him. So mean.", "Rather than blowing up at him, I would explain to him how much this custom means to me. \n\nIn my home, stockings are the best part of Christmas and we pick up items all year round to fill them. Some are joke items, some are practical, some are luxury items, some are edible treats, some are things we would never want anyone else to see.  I am always up early to start the turkey and really enjoy my private time digging into my stocking by the Christmas tree lights long before anyone else is up. \n\nIt would not be Chrismtas without a stocking!", "NTA. Stop buying his stocking presents. And maybe all other presents for him.", "NTA.\n\nOP, please take a moment to step back and evaluate your situation.\n\nYour husband finds the idea of helping by you so ludicrous that your requests could only be a joke.\n\nHow did things get to this point? Have you always believed that you, an *ER nurse*, really has more time and flexibility than someone in \u201cmarketing\u201d? \n\nIt strongly sounds like the division of labor for your household isn\u2019t fair, especially if you are taking on more shifts. It also sounds like your choice to do the majority of the homemaking isn\u2019t appreciated.\n\nSomehow, somewhere, things got so unbalanced that it\u2019s unsustainable. Perhaps it was that way from the start.\n\nYour husband shouldn\u2019t be angry  at you for asking for help. \n\nI think it\u2019s time to have some serious conversations with your husband.", ">  I do a large amount of the household responsibilities, which is fine as my husband is very busy working in the marketing sector.\n\nRight. Because you're not busy working as an _ER nurse_.\n\nYour issues run way deeper than a Christmas stocking... But you're NTA here; don't stuff his ever again.", "NTA.  First off, ER nurses are the shit- so thank you and please just know I think you\u2019re awesome.  Secondly, my wife and I have this same conflict because I hate Christmas and all the extra shit that comes along with it.  If you ask me, we make so big a deal out of all the special foods, trees, decorations, gifts, etc. that it\u2019s not a holiday at all- its just a money and energy blackhole that I wish I could circumvent with every passing year.  Believe me when I say that I sympathize with your husband in that I wish I could just be left alone on the holiday, enjoy my god damn time off, and not have to worry about whether I got the right presents or whether I\u2019m reacting well enough for the people that got me something.  All of that being said, you literally just asked your husband to go and pick some things from a list to put in your stocking- you made it as easy as possible.  That is not too much for a wife to ask of her husband once a year.  He\u2019s an asshole for thinking it is.", "NTA- stop buying his stuff and your in-laws. Honestly, though the fact that he won\u2019t because \u201cit\u2019s not his thing\u201d and laughs when you express your frustration just shows that he doesn\u2019t care or respect you.", "NTA- but your husband is.\n\nKill him with kindness fill his and leave yours empty do not bring it up again ( you are too busy).\n\nCome Christmas morning when you forgot to do your own and are the only one with a empty stocking - if he has a heart he will realise what a AH he is.\n\nEdit:  A similar situation happened with my dad to my mom when I was a kid (not out of malice but he was very busy and forgot).   30+ years later that Christmas still haunts him- All of us still like to bring it up \ud83e\udd37.", " Nta and like others say don't do it for him", "NTA\n\nStuff your own. He can go without from now on. He just told you that it is unreasonable and childish.....bet that tune changes when he is the only one without.", "NTA. Let the stocking stay empty. \n\nBuy yourself whatever you want, when you want it but stop making him look good by filling your own stocking. In fact I\u2019d probably just remove the parents stockings all together to avoid future problems.", "Well, your husband is tone deaf and an ass.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nGet your own stocking stuffers.  Don't fill your husband's stocking.  He's just told you that adults fill their own stockings.  \n\nAlso, your husband should be the one choosing, buying, and wrapping gifts for your ILs.  Those are his family members and his responsibility.", "NTA and I hope you return every single gift you got for him. \u201cNot his thing\u201d??? It\u2019s not about the gifts, it\u2019s about the effort. You deserve better than that.", "NTA but your husband definitely is. How come you are the only one that knows what the kids like? Does he realise the small ppl living in your house are his kids?", "NTA, the lazy guy you married is the ass, and should get a stocking full of coal.", "He doesn\u2019t buy me a present for under the tree as he\u2019s never sure of what to get me and when I give him ideas he claims that there\u2019s no thought and it\u2019s the thought that counts. It has been something  I haven\u2019t loved in the past but have made my peace with it as my children are now old enough to get me presents on their own accord with thought behind it.", "Going with his belief that \"it's the thought that counts\" - he has shown that he has no \"thoughts\" for you. Laughing at you when you were upset offends me even more than the gift issue. In that case, it is the basic \"respect\" that counts. He doesn't sound like he was a lot of that for you either. Very concerning.", "You don't get any presents from him at all at Christmas and you are asking if you're the AH, you definitely aren't and deserve a lot more respect and kindness from your husband. \nNext year drop the rope, leave him to get the presents for his family and just sort your family, children and something for yourself. \nNTA", "I just worry that I\u2019m not being fair to him by getting upset over this because gift giving isn\u2019t his love language or anything like that and yet I still except it from him.", "That's a bullshit excuse. \n\nIt doesn't matter what his love language is. If he wants to show his love for you, he should express it in whatever *your* love language is.\n\nBesides, I bet he loves receiving gifts just fine. He just doesn't want to give them, because he's a grifter.", "Who cares whether it's his love language or not, it's Christmas and he should be buying gifts for you. He is treating you really badly and gaslighting you into blaming yourself when you ask for the bare minimum. He laughed at you when you were upset, no partner should be doing that to the person they are supposed to love more than anyone else in the world.", "I understand the idea of love languages has helped a ton of people but I need to point out that they aren\u2019t literal languages. \n\nYou aren\u2019t asking him to speak french when he only knows mandarin. You asked him to buy things with a very detailed list in a common store.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if gifts are his \u201clove language.\u201d How many things have you done for him were only for his benefit? How many times have you made choice with only him in mind?\n\nYou are an ER nurse. Your job is far more demanding and far less flexible than a job in marketing. What does your husband do, ever, to help make your life a little bit easier?"]}
