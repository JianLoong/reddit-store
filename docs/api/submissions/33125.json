If you ask me, we make so big a deal out of all the special foods, trees, decorations, gifts, etc. that it\u2019s not a holiday at all- its just a money and energy blackhole that I wish I could circumvent with every passing year.  Believe me when I say that I sympathize with your husband in that I wish I could just be left alone on the holiday, enjoy my god damn time off, and not have to worry about whether I got the right presents or whether I\u2019m reacting well enough for the people that got me something.  All of that being said, you literally just asked your husband to go and pick some things from a list to put in your stocking- you made it as easy as possible.  That is not too much for a wife to ask of her husband once a year.  He\u2019s an asshole for thinking it is.", "NTA- stop buying his stuff and your in-laws.

Very concerning.", "You don't get any presents from him at all at Christmas and you are asking if you're the AH, you definitely aren't and deserve a lot more respect and kindness from your husband. \nNext year drop the rope, leave him to get the presents for his family and just sort your family, children and something for yourself. \nNTA", "I just worry that I\u2019m not being fair to him by getting upset over this because gift giving isn\u2019t his love language or anything like that and yet I still except it from him.", "That's a bullshit excuse. \n\nIt doesn't matter what his love language is.

You asked him to buy things with a very detailed list in a common store.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if gifts are his \u201clove language.\u201d How many things have you done for him were only for his benefit? How many times have you made choice with only him in mind?\n\nYou are an ER nurse. Your job is far more demanding and far less flexible than a job in marketing.

Return EVERYTHING for his stocking and his  present. What an AH.  he laughed at you because you want him to do something nice for you!? WHY would  you do anything nice for   \nhim? I would treat him like a roommate or child going forward. No more adult anything if he can't act like a caring partner.", "Oh my goodness! You could not have made it any easier for him. Definitely NTA, but I have concerns about your husband!\n\nAs another poster suggested, don't give him any gifts or put things in his stocking this year - even though you already have them. Return all of the items and treat yourself to something nice in the Christmas sales.\n\nAfter the holidays, I encourage you to sit down with him and try to have a mature conversation about this issue and let him know your boundaries on gift buying going forward.\n\nSome suggestions:\n- You will no longer undertake all of the gift organising for everyone. He is expected to contribute.\n- He is responsible for getting any gifts his family receives\n- You will not be buying him any gifts, including stocking stuffers, unless he is reciprocating and doing the same for you\n- You will continue to organise gifts for the children, but expect him to go with you to do the shopping.\n\nHe clearly doesn't appreciate all the time and effort you invest to get it all organised in advance, especially around a demanding job.\n\nSeems to me, getting gifts for your stocking would be an excellent way of demonstrating his appreciation and is a small thing that matters a lot to you.\n\nI hope you and your family have a wonderful Christmas \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf81", "NTA!! \n\nListen, I'm a 35yo woman.

He needs to respect you instead of taking you for granted.", "NTA !!!!\n\nI often tell my husband NOT to buy me a Christmas gift because I don\u2019t need anything and money gets tight this time of year.

Not even registering that you\u2019ve been doing your own stocking because you are the only one to worry about your needs.\n\nWhat does he do to show he loves you, by the way house chores and watching the children are bare minimum since that\u2019s called living in a home and parenting.\n\nWhat does he do for your birthdays, Mothers Day, anniversaries, valentines? Does he take you on random date nights? Does he know what your order is without asking at your regular takeout spots?  What does he do that shows he cares about you?", "He thinks it\u2019s \u201cthe thought that counts\u201d but also refuses to spend a single solitary second thinking of a gift for her. Bonkers.", "I do, and have met plenty. They're the type of people who think it's normal to hate your spouse, and for men to hate women and vice versa. Having contempt for your spouse is inevitable if you have contempt for all women.", "Right! I can't imagine straight up laughing at your spouse with they ask for help, tell you something is important to them, and even gift your a list of things to help you help them. Straight up rude and disrespectful.\n\nFor you, that's something you have discussed and agree on.  My spouse and I aren't big gift people either. I bought a foot massager during black Friday, they bought headphones during black Friday. We're good. We actually just talked about Christmas gifts....or the lack of them yesterday. \n\nBut if my spouse said they wanted a stocking of knicknak gifts, AND provided a list of stuff to pick from. That stocking would be stuffed.", "Right, but OP's situation is completely different.  My mister and I have started buying \"gifts for the house\" that we're slowly fixing up, but that's what we discussed and both wanted to do.  You and your mister both wanted to give each other experiences. \n\nOP's husband wants to do exactly nothing, and still have everything magically benefit. All the emotional labor, all the literal labor, while he contributes nothing, zilch, nada.  NOPE!", "Right? We agree we have a lot of stuff and for birthdays, we do a nice dinner and homemade cake plus a few small things we think would please the other. It doesn\u2019t even have to be expensive; I got my wife a quarter she hadn\u2019t been able to find for her collection due to the change shortage. Cost: $0.25 plus hours of me going back and forth to banks trading tubes of quarters to find the elusive coin.", "Agree \ud83d\udcaf. For us, it\u2019s tours when we travel. We don\u2019t just sit in the room. So on the special day we might exchange handwritten cards but on our next trip see an international soccer game or ride an inflatable boat into some (mild!) rapids.", "Agreed, OP, your NTA and I am so dang annoyed FOR you. I work in an ER too, I know what you do. I can't believe you can get all that stuff done while your husband is persona non grata. GRRRR.", "Yes!  That\u2019s a good kid. \nMy advice would be to return anything you bought your husband. Get yourself some nice things for your stocking. Enjoy watching his reaction to zero presents this year while you pull things you absolutely love out of your own stocking.", "I am beyond proud of him. He\u2019s well on his way to being an amazing and compassionate man. But the fact that he recognized it, and felt the need to make up for something I\u2019ve long since gone numb to, feels like a parenting fail. Adults like to pretend that kids don\u2019t pick up on the \u201cgrown up\u201d nonsense, but they do.", "Especially one that laughs at you when you\u2019re upset.", "Right??  Stabby, stabby, stabby.  Why do people put up with this garbage treatment?  (that's rhetorical, there are reasons, I just feel bad for so many women.)\n\nI've said it in this sub before, but when I randomly look over at my husband and say, \"You know, you're pretty awesome,\" or \"I really appreciate you.\" He always says, \"You're reading AITA again, aren't you?\"", "Punished for having the temerity to ask your partner to do the bare fucking minimum. Coal is too valuable for OP's hubby, tbh.", "This should be the top comment.", "And if that failed, he's do the errand but he would 'improvise'  and not get anything on the list.", "This stuck out to me too. My partner might have his faults but he knows what our kids are into. He suggested getting my daughter a piano keyboard for Christmas because she asked for piano lessons a couple months back. He's the one who picked out the Dragon Ball action figure my son wanted. I know he likes it but I didn't know Bardock was his favorite and my bf jumped at the chance to get it for him. \n\nNow getting me gifts is where he struggles. It's not for a lack of trying. I have a lot of hyperfixations that wane in interest from time to time so I know I'm hard to buy for. I just make a cute little list with links to make it easy for him lol. The stocking is something that has been an issue in the past but he realized what an ass he was when our kids were confused as to why Santa didn't fill up moms stocking but he did dad's lol. The shame was enough punishment I think.", "She should warp up divorce papers for him under the tree he clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit about her", "I'm not sure it's the best idea to cause upset on the day, even if justified. There's no need to upset the kids.\n\nOP definitely needs a conversation to set expectations, could be for this and future years, still time before the 25th!\n\nCould also get the kids involved - \"Dad isn't really into choosing gifts, how about you pick up stocking fillers for each other from now on\"", "For real. My gf and I will occasionally send a text while the other is out and about, asking for a surprise. It started as a joke so there's never any obligation, but we almost always get each other something fun just to make the other happy", "Hamilton. Lol", "If I were you I'd make my gift to me from him a relaxing spa weekend.", "Not to mention, a large portion of the entire idea of \"languages\" is to learn to \"speak\" to your partner. It may not be YOUR language, but if receiving gifts is someone's love language, a good partner would put in real effort to find something meaningful.\n\nThis husband is just a dick. As a mediocre husband myself, this guy offends me.\n\nNTA.", "THIS!!!!\n\nIt\u2019s a tool to help you understand how things that don\u2019t matter to you can make the other people\nfeel loved so you can be seen as more loving. \n\nIt\u2019s not a pass to only do things according to YOUR love language. It\u2019s intended to better enable you to speak live in a way the other person will hear.", "I would also send his parents and whatnots gifts back too, his family his responsibility. Fk it.", ">a subterranean level of expectations for anyone who celebrates.\n\nRight! That bar isn't just low, someone needed a Shovel to get it down that far!", "I mean, that line alone paints the whole picture. \"it's the thought that counts,\" his words. OP does not count in his mind. \n\nEven if someone is hard to buy for, you get something ridiculous. But OP has told him what she would like, provided him with a list. If you can't think of something, you can always fall back on the list. But husband has zero consideration for OP.", "Not disagreeing about OP\u2019s situation being different; my comment was a poorly written attempt at saying that if the husband doesn\u2019t want to do gifts, it\u2019s entirely reasonable/possible to do so, but it requires communication (long before the holidays) and both people being on board with it. Hence the \u201chusband is a straight up AH\u201d comment.", "It wasn't your fail, and let me tell you something *right now*, the lesson he learnt? He saw you doing your best, handling your business and doing all that you could. He was raised by a strong mama. *You* did that. He learned to be this incredible young man from *you*. He had a crappy father who didn't cherish his mother, and he rejected that lesson. He learned from *you* x", "Awwwww what a sweet caring kid!", "He deserves no gifts for the rest of his life", "OMG yes! This.", "I love this", "I do exactly the same thing, he always knows what I've been reading! Saying that, the bar is set SO low by the men posted about on here.", "For real. Sometimes I just can\u2019t believe these people exist in life.", "I wasn\u2019t really serious about doing this but it\u2019s fun to imagine. \n\nThat said, I don\u2019t think she needs to make excuses for this sorry excuse of a husband and father either. Especially for her son, she ought to be making it very clear that his behavior is NOT normal and NOT okay - otherwise she\u2019s going to raise sons who do the same shit to their wives and think it\u2019s fine to \u201cnot really be into choosing gifts\u201d as an excuse to be a terrible husband.", "Love gifts! Try surprising her without a text sometime - sounds like gifts might be a love language. \u2764\ufe0f", "EXACTLY! \n\nIn this context \"love languages\" is utter bullshit. Absolute unequivocal bullshit. It's a nonsense excuse that allows him to treat OP with disrespect and disregard. \n\nFirst of all, there is exactly zero science or any type of study behind the love languages. It's something a pastor, or something similar, made up to help congregants that blew up. \n\nSecond, the whole point of his book was that maybe you \"receive\" love most effectively in the form of gifts, but your partner is more about time together. So YOU find the compromise and figure out how to \"speak\" their language so that they are receiving the love you're trying to give them. In my example that means you figure out a schedule and spend intentional time with them, not that you go \"here's another thing you don't want or care about, because this is how I prefer to receive and show love. So suck it up buttercup!\"\n\nSo, op, what is YOUR love language? Because if he's gonna go down that road, that's the question he should be asking. \n\nWhich, again, is really just across the board bullshit..... BECAUSE IT'S CHRISTMAS! HALF THE FUN, IF NOT MORE, IS THE FREAKING GIFTS!!!", "Exactly. My SO is not really a natural little gift giver. It just didn\u2019t occur to him. But I really appreciate it so he makes an effort to remember now and then. That\u2019s the whole point of the idea.", "BINGO! My husband knows how much Christmas means to me and how hard I  work. Gifts are not his love language either, but he knows it's mine.", "You and I think the same ;-). Let his ungrateful ass figure it out.", "They needed an excavator and mine workings, never mind a shovel.", "How right you are.  I realize now it sounded like I was arguing with you, which wasn't my intent.  :)", "Thank you. From one internet stranger to another, thank you for saying something I didn\u2019t know I needed to hear. Wishing you and your family a safe and happy holiday season!", "From OP or their kids. The only gift he deserves are the ones from the dog in his shoe.", "Take back the gift that's already been purchased and if he's upset tell him to get over himself", "He deserves to be alone for the rest of his life.

But only some. Like, some people, the first thing they do, when they hear someone is seriously ill, is make them food.  Me? When a request to sign up to make food, I NEVER sign up.  I will, however, happily make them a quilt.  \n\nAt my synagogue, the people that run stuff know to know even bother asking me to bring snacks for the snacks after.  I won\u2019t.  But if a Tallis on the rack needs mending, or the table cloths need sewing, or we need a new Torah cover?  They call me!  \n\nHow do you like to show someone you care?  What does your partner like to have done for them?  You both have to cooperate to make sure that all these needs are met.  \n\nBut, OP\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t sound like he is doing *anything*.  No presents for him!", "Well, now you know. And whenever you feel down, I want you to remember that. Whatever you've gone through, whenever lies ahead, look at what you've achieved.
