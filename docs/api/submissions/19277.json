She left you.

You guys were together for a year and a half. Calling the ex that you dumped thinking they would do something for you is not going to work out.

The sentence, \"It's over,\" is all-inclusive.", "NTA\n\nTechnically, she\u2019s not your fianc\u00e9e anymore so you shouldn\u2019t exactly be expected to cut your vacation time. You also did ask if there was anything you can do to help, so it\u2019s not like you cut off contact and are acting like she\u2019s a total stranger now. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve done anything that was over the line and you shouldn\u2019t be obligated to attend the funeral if she broke it off with you. I could see you being the AH if you were a short drive away and had the time to attend just as a courtesy but you\u2019re in another country.

ETA: also, when she gave you back the ring, I assume it was a clean break up? Or was there any discussion of getting back together when she\u2019s in a better headspace?", "NTA.\n\nI'm sure you felt terrible for her... if she wanted you to help, she could've waited for you to get back so you could be there to support her. That is, if it still felt comfortable for you. These days, people often have the service later, especially with cremation, so that more people can come to pay their respects. \n\nShe's the one who ended it, for whatever reason, but she basically took out some angst on you inappropriately. Maybe it felt good to unleash. But you had zero ownership in this.", "NAH.\n\nYou are not wrong for taking the trip or missing her father\u2019s funeral. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t take her reaction personal. Her father passed away. She is in a very emotional space.", "INFO: It seems like she had a lot going on, and used that as a reason to give you your ring back. Was it done-done, or was there some sort of hope/expectation that you\u2019d revisit each other? How close are/were you after the breakup, and what type of relationship did you envision with her going forward?", "INFO This really does depend on how long you were together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
