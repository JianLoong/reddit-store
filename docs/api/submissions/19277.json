Regardless, she gave you back the ring *because of her family situation* and you haven't indicated that she left the door open to additional discussion or consideration further down the road.\n\nMaybe she realized, just a little too late, how good it would be to have you in her life *because of her family situation,* but you don't get to have it both ways.\n\nSounds like a shitty situation for her to deal with, but you're NTA.", "NTA\n\n She is your ex.

NTA, she broke up with you. That's the end of your future interactions. I understand if you were close to the man when he was alive. If you had that kind of a relationship with him, maybe it's an AH move to not go to the funeral, but you're not her boyfriend or fiance anymore. She was just looking for someone to dump on because she's feeling bad.", "NTA. \n\nI think it would have been extraordinarily kind of you if you could have made it, but you\u2019re entitled not to change your vacation plans to attend your ex\u2019s dad\u2019s funeral.

Having said that, if you have hopes of working things out with her, there is no way that is going to happen unless you show up for her. Often times relationships end during times of life transitions or great external stress, but if the two of you had a good relationship otherwise and would consider a re-do once her life settles down and she is able to think about a relationship again, then you might consider postponing the trip and supporting her in her grief.", "Life isn't a hollywood movie, where you break up with someone the the guy lingers on for you attention... people move on.\n\n\nNTA", "INFO did you interact with her dad after the breakup? Have you and your ex been in touch?

But in this case the logistics weren't possible.", "NTA exactly. she needs help but had let you know, you were not the one for her. she ended it and then to expect you to step up?

NAH.", "I don't understand people calling her TA. She called and informed OP of her dad's passing. He said they were on good terms, and it seems as if her father and OP had a decent relationship.

Did she also break up with you??\n\nSecond sentence of the post says they broke up.", "Gonna disagree there. The funeral is for the living. The living in this case hurt him really bad. No one needs to open their own wounds to pay respects.", "Well. If it there was talks about a reconciliation or if it wasn\u2019t a clean break then it is a bit insensitive given how OP knew about the effect this has on her.
