Regardless, she gave you back the ring *because of her family situation* and you haven't indicated that she left the door open to additional discussion or consideration further down the road.\n\nMaybe she realized, just a little too late, how good it would be to have you in her life *because of her family situation,* but you don't get to have it both ways.\n\nSounds like a shitty situation for her to deal with, but you're NTA.", "NTA\n\n She is your ex.

NTA, she broke up with you. That's the end of your future interactions. I understand if you were close to the man when he was alive. If you had that kind of a relationship with him, maybe it's an AH move to not go to the funeral, but you're not her boyfriend or fiance anymore.

Having said that, if you have hopes of working things out with her, there is no way that is going to happen unless you show up for her. Often times relationships end during times of life transitions or great external stress, but if the two of you had a good relationship otherwise and would consider a re-do once her life settles down and she is able to think about a relationship again, then you might consider postponing the trip and supporting her in her grief.", "Life isn't a hollywood movie, where you break up with someone the the guy lingers on for you attention... people move on.\n\n\nNTA", "INFO did you interact with her dad after the breakup?

You took it a different way and decided to continue with the trip, and you\u2019re entitled to, but that doesn\u2019t make her an AH for viewing things differently and hoping for support in her grief.

I mean as long as they didn't plan to marry in a few weeks or in a few days then I don't see a good reason to end an engagement just because your father is ill.
