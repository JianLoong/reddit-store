We have a good relationship as siblings and friends, and I also get along well with her husband, despite not knowing him too well. \n\nOne morning, my sister and I were playing with her son on my bed, and I noticed how calm he became when she hugged him. We had a lighthearted conversation about cuddling, where she mentioned her husband's concern about cuddling the baby too much would make him soft. I expressed my belief that cuddles make kids feel secure and happy and to not let her husband dictate cuddle rules. However, my sister unexpectedly snapped at me, feeling that I had insinuated something negative about her husband. I was taken aback because I thought we were having some banter. I knew her husband wasn\u2019t serious about his comment! She then said she wishes she hadn\u2019t discussed the topic with me. This is the third time she\u2019s snapped at me during her visit for context. I normally apologise but this time I could tell she was triggered by my words and told me off?\n\nI decided to take some time alone to think things through. Later, my sister confronted me about crossing a boundary by making that comment. I explained that I never intended to insult her husband or be rude, but rather, I wanted my nephew to feel loved. However, she insisted that I had crossed a line and accused me of not respecting other people's boundaries while enforcing my own. She went as far as saying \u201cyou have no right to tell me what to do\u201d. This made me so angry so in order to regain composure I simply said okay and asked her to leave my room. \n\nOur conversation ended abruptly, and we didn't speak for the rest of the day. The next day, I offered her a cup of coffee as a peace offering, as I believed she had misunderstood my intentions and reacted strongly. However, she expressed discomfort being at our house and left to house sit for a relative which made my mom cry. I don't believe my comment was that offensive, and it seems like the situation has been blown out of proportion. I'm unsure if I am the one at fault here.

Perhaps this is a subject that she has dealt with before with others and you're getting the brunt of her response?  That's unclear, but what is clear is that she is over-reacting to what you said.  I would probably tell her that she misunderstood where you were coming from but you will keep your opinions to yourself in the future.  NTA", "NTA .

She probably wants her husband to be more affectionate with her son, and has concerns about it.", "NTA... red flags all over....\"I think thous does protest too much\".\n\nDont defualt to \"sorry\"... ask exactly how it is offensive ? What does she think you are insinuating. Demand she apologize for snaoping at you for talking about hugs and cuddles for her son.", "NTA. Could your sister be experiencing postpartum depression?

Possibly with her husband or her living situation.", "NTA- how long ago did she give birth? The lack of sleep and out of whack hormones could be the culprit. I was out of sorts, to put it nicely, for the first 10 months or so.", "Since OP has mentioned her sister is very religious, I can hazard a guess, which may be completely wrong. Maybe the husband 100% does believe in stereotypical gender BS like cuddling boys will make them weak. And sister perhaps believes a good wife obeys her husband\u2019s views/instructions about child rearing, even though she also believes he may be wrong. That could lead to her lashing out in this way. Maybe?", "NTA \n\nYour sister's husband is the asshole. Infants do need to feel loved and secure. They can't manipulate. They don't have wants. They have NEEDS. His concerns about making an infant soft are toxic masculinity at its finest.

Im not sure if i agree with all the flags people are posting in the comments but i do agree the hormonal stuff may be a cause of the overreaction.

I'm sure I'm just going to sound like a cranky old person, but, what I've noticed withall this boundary talk within the last several years, people always say you're crossing my boundary or pushing my boundary when they're never clear as to what the boundary is, just that there is one.", "Obviously she is upset about something that is much more than your comment. It sounded like you were an outlet for that abrupt shift on your sister\u2019s part. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s her husband that caused it by his comment, or she may have a touch of postpartum. I don\u2019t know. Give her a couple of days and cool off, and she will come around. You said what you needed to say about not meaning anything by the comment, and she took it to the next level. I sincerely hope she doesn\u2019t make this a reason to go limited contact or no contact. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nSomething else is going on, especially since she was on edge the whole trip. Could be anything: her realizing she needs better boundaries and figuring out that line, her having a harder time with the religious and lifestyles differences between her and the rest your family, to something far more minor or innocuous.\n\nAsk if she would like to talk about what happened and make clear your intention is to listen and understand.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s not angry at your comment about her husband.

Do you have a habit being bossy?", ">This is the third time she\u2019s snapped at me during her visit for context.\n\n\nI think there's a lot at play here.   She's a new mom so likely sleep deprived, stressed out, dealing with insane life and physical changes.  And let's not discount the emotional and cognitive toll.\n\nThe antiquated \"cuddling makes soft kids\" theory is just that, antiquated.  And disproven.  Men who still subscribe to that line of thought tend to hold more traditional values regarding gender roles and division of labor.  Meaning your sister may not be getting much help at home.  \n\nThat is, of course, an assumption.  Hopefully you are correct in believing her husband was just joking about cuddling and none of the above is true.\n\n\nNTA.  All things said and done, you didn't intentionally overstep her boundaries or intentionally insult her husband.  Just continue to be supportive.", "You are NTA, but some perspective here... My family hates my brother in law (for good reason) . Therefore I am always feeling protective of my husband, and would probably become defensive in this situation as well. Couple that with new mom hormones....you can't win here. Your sister is objectively TA, but I think she's just extra sensitive, and needs some space to calm down from all the tension.", "NTA. She knows the husband is a toxic asshat and she feels bad about it. As well she should. Shitty situation to bring a kid into, doubly so since he's a boy.", "NTA. She thinks that her husband\u2019s comment was wrong as well. She got defensive because she\u2019s not doing anything about it and someone else saying it makes it real for her.

I'm wondering if she is feeling uneasy about his patriarchal attitude.  Perhaps take some time off from her? She's being mean. \n\nNTA", "No abuse. She's an excellent mother and I think her husband is a sweetheart. I agree. I can't really do anything without grovelling and I don't want to apologise to her every single time she gets her knickers in a twist.", "Yeah! It was just an exchange of perspectives!", "Thank you for this advice. I know she has felt like people walk all over her in the past or meddle in her business. We talk about this and support each other. I never ask her anything personal about her marriage and I have said to that I will only ask \"How is the marriage going?\" once a month and wait for to be like \"It's going good!\" and leave it there. I will definitely keep my opinions to myself in the future. It is clear it is a touchy subject. I'm just annoyed that she left because now I can't even work towards a solution with her. It feels so weird.", "Literally. I felt like that was obvious from reading this. The mom deep down knows her husbands relationship with their son is not a healthy one (very little affection) and OP's comment hit a little too close to home.", "Maybe! She has never shared this concern with me, so I honestly couldn't tell you. I hope she resolves it. Her husband seems very affectionate towards his son from what I've seen....", "Maybe, thank you for pointing this out. She had the baby almost 8 months ago. I'm going to do some research to see what I can do. I feel like I should give her space right now though.", "So we've had a few disagreements because we both have very different lifestyles and views on things. She is very religious and I am not. We have worked really hard to find a no man's land where we can still have a good bond without getting into arguments. \n\nOccasionally, I'll slip up and say something inappropriate or she will say something that I'm just not cool consigning and we'll get into disagreements. Last time, I said something jokingly (I have the dumb sense of humour) \"it smells weird like a coochie or something...omg is it me?!\" and she got angry at me for using the word \"coochie\" because it's rude I guess. I didn't say this in front of my nephew but I said it in front of her and my mother. She had a go at me and snapped again. I again stonewalled her and just put on my earphones, didn't speak to her for the rest of the evening. We made up the next day and both apologised for being shitty. \n\nRegarding other people's boundaries-I'm not entirely sure what this is about either. I felt like she was just attacking me. I don't think I cross people's boundaries. When she arrived I had gotten into a tiff with my little brothers because I was upset that I had cooked and cleaned and no one really appreciated it. I said something like \"you guys don't do anything around here!\" which made them angry because honestly, I was out of line because they help out a lot. I felt a little sad because they were being cold with me and I explained to her what happened. I assume she was referring to this moment?", "I think he was kidding probably. He is a proper joker. I knew that when I made the comment. It was honestly such a light-hearted conversation.", "I'm seeing a few comments like this which is making me worried. I haven't seen a single indication of this...they seem so happy. I feel like I should ask but I also don't want to cross her boundary again...", "No she lives in a different city but she's visiting.", "This is a good point but I'm really struggling to see my sister going along with the no-hugging nonsense. Gender roles and obeying your husband, I know she follows these things to a certain extent. She's a strong woman so I don't think she would lash out just because I disagreed with her man...it's not like her. But some other people have mentioned that postpartum makes you feel a bit unlike yourself so maybe this is the reason.", "Yeah, I thought we were grown enough to have conversations about stuff like this. I think I should've not walked off maybe and asked her to explain why she was upset at me but at the same time, I was feeling really sore about some other stuff and she had already snapped a few times that week. I was over it tbh.", "I don't think she's more protective of her husband. I've seen how she's with that kid. He is the most precious thing in the world to her like you can feel the love for him radiating off her. It's so sweet. I think she's trying to control the perception of her married life and maybe felt I was overstepping with my opinion but I don't know how we're meant to communicate if I can't say anything without her feeling triggered. I wish I knew all her triggers so I could steer clear but I don't know them.", "Agree. I think this is the most likely explanation. I will give some space and follow up.", "Yes, this honestly didn't cross my mind initially. She had the baby almost 8 months ago. I don't know much about postpartum but I will research it now.", "Oh you wise person! So I went on the glorious internet and I asked dr google \"boundary vs trigger\" turns out they are very different things and people are always confusing triggers with a boundary. \n\nShe was triggered by my comment because it implied something about her parenting style and the boundary was please don't make remarks about my family and how I do things as a mother especially because we've had an unstable childhood and I worry for my son.\n\nNow, I don't ever expect people to have the right words, especially when they are in crisis but I think we're old enough to do some inside work before we go down the confrontation route. I also think she could've led with this is my boundary etc rather than \"you've crossed my boundary because you always cross boundaries because you're the sort of person who doesn't respect boundaries\" which is utterly untrue. \n\nHowever, I think I could've definitely asked more questions instead of shutting her down. I was just too emotional to speak anymore without getting angry at her. \n\nI spend hours online reading about boundaries and triggers to understand what went wrong. I don't mind doing this but I honestly kept racking my brain because I felt really emotional and like I was the villain as I'm kind of the black sheep of the family which is why I came here to get a second opinion. \n\nThank you for your comment.", "Yes, this is a very wise thing to do. I'll give her some time and then we can talk about it. \n\nJust to clarify the religious thing. Everyone in my family is religious except for me and my older brother. She's got a very welcoming and open space when it comes to her faith in our home.", "Okay, I agree. I don't want her to ruin my relationship with her over this so I'll give her space. I suppose I haven't really been trying to imagine what she's going through much. I guess it's harder when you've shared a room with someone for the first 18 years of your life. I just see her as my sister but I get she's a mother and a wife-a lot to handle on ya own!", "She's a new mom, her hormones are all over the place and she's probably hardly slept. She's defensive of everything, because her body is running on pure adrenaline. I remember those early months. If she's not usually like this, try to let moments of irrational upset go if you can. But up to a point, because anger, sometimes blinding rage, is actually one of the first and strongest symptoms of PPD in many women. Your sister might need help from a doctor. Keep an eye on her, give her grace, and remind her of your patience when you have your own \ud83d\ude02", "She is a new mom. You could consider it part of the whole not sleeping marathon...", "Another thing to think about is new parents are dealing with unsolicited advice from all sources (parents, friends, facebook etc) that might be part of the reaction coupled with sleep deprivation. I'm still tired and my son is 8 months old thought he is our second so I mostly ignore comments I don't agree with. I don't think you did anything wrong and you're doing what you can to help them.", "PPD can last a long time especially if sleep deprived. One of my children didn\u2019t start sleeping through the night until over a year old.", "This was my first thought. Maybe she\u2019s just a sleep deprived new mom who is tired of hearing everyone\u2019s opinions and needed some space \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So you dismiss her boundaries about language, dismissed her husband's POV, dismiss your brother's contribution.\n\n>she will say something that I'm just not cool consigning\n\nWhat does she do to instigate you?\n\nThere's a lot of missing context here and don't think her anger was really about one comment on cuddling", "My reading of this is that your sis may not believe her husband is joking and is likely feeling insecure about how they are going to parent together and whether there is going to be conflict about how to raise their son.", "Maybe. Possibly also if she DOESN\u2019T want to go along with her husband on no cuddling, and she\u2019s fighting a big internal struggle of her mothering instinct being at odds with her desire to obey her husband, that would exactly result in her lashing out at YOU. She knows he\u2019s wrong. You know he\u2019s wrong. You saying he\u2019s wrong forced her to acknowledge that to herself, and it\u2019s making her doubt her beliefs.", "Oooh this totally makes sense!! I think perhaps it\u2019s time for you and your sister to learn how to communicate rather than reacting/using emotions to express feelings. Over time, I\u2019ve had to learn how to articulate why I feel the way I do, and what I need/what I don\u2019t want from my husband. It has helped us so much, and I find that we fight less because both he and I know how to navigate these situations better.", "My sibling and I are very different too, but were extremely close growing up, so I have all the sympathy for both of you. I think I am more like your sister, and you would be more like my sibling. I am just having my first child (this month) and am more conservative. My sibling is very liberal and can sometimes offend me with their language and choices.\nIf it were me who offended my sibling, and I thought they were overreacting, I'd probably still send a text along the lines of \"I'm sorry I upset you, I'll try not to overstep like that in the future, I love you and want us to get along, so do you want me to leave you alone for a few days, or would you like me to send you funny memes until you're not mad at me anymore?\" \n\nI'm not quite so uptight as to get offended by the word coochie though, so idk.  Relationships are tough. I'll always love my sibling though, even if they do make me upset sometimes!", "To be fair, if you come to my house, you\u2019re getting the real me. I\u2019m not walking on egg shells to appease anyone. Go stay somewhere else if you\u2019re that easily offended.", "Well, she wants me to listen to her views on religion which I'm more than happy to do. She preaches to me often, I do not protest, I listen and ask questions. \n\nWhen I tell her about a concert I went to or an interesting cocktail I had a cool bar, a date I went on or even when I shaved the sides of my head, she'll tell me outright she doesn't want to hear anything about it because she believes listening to sinful things is being complicit. If something cool has happened and she doesn't approve, she won't share in my joy. I'm also an artist so when I paint stuff like nude bodies-she won't come near it. I basically can't talk about any aspect of my life with her because it isn't allowed in our religion and I've made my peace with this, I keep my stuff to myself. \n\nI do occasionally slip up but like I said, we've worked towards a no mans land space where we don't bring in politics, culture, religion or anything polarising. I accept that she wants to talk about religion though because sharing religious stories is also part of practising and I don't want to stop her from practising in any way. \n\nI do respect her boundaries. I don't think I have suggested that I am perfect throughout this threat. A slip-up is not the same as outright dismissing in my opinion. I guess I did dismiss her husband's POV.  Dismiss my brothers contribution-yeah I suppose I did in a way because I felt unappreciated in that moment but it wasn't right for me to say it the way I did. I can admit that and talked it out. \n\nI think you're right about it being about something more but she didn't communicate that clearly."]}
