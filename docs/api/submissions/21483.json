We have a good relationship as siblings and friends, and I also get along well with her husband, despite not knowing him too well. \n\nOne morning, my sister and I were playing with her son on my bed, and I noticed how calm he became when she hugged him. We had a lighthearted conversation about cuddling, where she mentioned her husband's concern about cuddling the baby too much would make him soft. I expressed my belief that cuddles make kids feel secure and happy and to not let her husband dictate cuddle rules. However, my sister unexpectedly snapped at me, feeling that I had insinuated something negative about her husband. I was taken aback because I thought we were having some banter. I knew her husband wasn\u2019t serious about his comment! She then said she wishes she hadn\u2019t discussed the topic with me. This is the third time she\u2019s snapped at me during her visit for context. I normally apologise but this time I could tell she was triggered by my words and told me off?\n\nI decided to take some time alone to think things through. Later, my sister confronted me about crossing a boundary by making that comment. I explained that I never intended to insult her husband or be rude, but rather, I wanted my nephew to feel loved. However, she insisted that I had crossed a line and accused me of not respecting other people's boundaries while enforcing my own. She went as far as saying \u201cyou have no right to tell me what to do\u201d. This made me so angry so in order to regain composure I simply said okay and asked her to leave my room. \n\nOur conversation ended abruptly, and we didn't speak for the rest of the day. The next day, I offered her a cup of coffee as a peace offering, as I believed she had misunderstood my intentions and reacted strongly. However, she expressed discomfort being at our house and left to house sit for a relative which made my mom cry. I don't believe my comment was that offensive, and it seems like the situation has been blown out of proportion. I'm unsure if I am the one at fault here.

Perhaps this is a subject that she has dealt with before with others and you're getting the brunt of her response?  That's unclear, but what is clear is that she is over-reacting to what you said.  I would probably tell her that she misunderstood where you were coming from but you will keep your opinions to yourself in the future.  NTA", "NTA .

Possibly with her husband or her living situation.", "NTA- how long ago did she give birth? The lack of sleep and out of whack hormones could be the culprit. I was out of sorts, to put it nicely, for the first 10 months or so.", "Since OP has mentioned her sister is very religious, I can hazard a guess, which may be completely wrong. Maybe the husband 100% does believe in stereotypical gender BS like cuddling boys will make them weak. And sister perhaps believes a good wife obeys her husband\u2019s views/instructions about child rearing, even though she also believes he may be wrong. That could lead to her lashing out in this way. Maybe?", "NTA \n\nYour sister's husband is the asshole. Infants do need to feel loved and secure. They can't manipulate. They don't have wants. They have NEEDS. His concerns about making an infant soft are toxic masculinity at its finest.

It sounded like you were an outlet for that abrupt shift on your sister\u2019s part. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s her husband that caused it by his comment, or she may have a touch of postpartum. I don\u2019t know. Give her a couple of days and cool off, and she will come around. You said what you needed to say about not meaning anything by the comment, and she took it to the next level. I sincerely hope she doesn\u2019t make this a reason to go limited contact or no contact. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nSomething else is going on, especially since she was on edge the whole trip. Could be anything: her realizing she needs better boundaries and figuring out that line, her having a harder time with the religious and lifestyles differences between her and the rest your family, to something far more minor or innocuous.\n\nAsk if she would like to talk about what happened and make clear your intention is to listen and understand.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s not angry at your comment about her husband.

Do you have a habit being bossy?", ">This is the third time she\u2019s snapped at me during her visit for context.\n\n\nI think there's a lot at play here.   She's a new mom so likely sleep deprived, stressed out, dealing with insane life and physical changes.  And let's not discount the emotional and cognitive toll.\n\nThe antiquated \"cuddling makes soft kids\" theory is just that, antiquated.  And disproven.  Men who still subscribe to that line of thought tend to hold more traditional values regarding gender roles and division of labor.  Meaning your sister may not be getting much help at home.  \n\nThat is, of course, an assumption.  Hopefully you are correct in believing her husband was just joking about cuddling and none of the above is true.\n\n\nNTA.  All things said and done, you didn't intentionally overstep her boundaries or intentionally insult her husband.  Just continue to be supportive.", "You are NTA, but some perspective here... My family hates my brother in law (for good reason) . Therefore I am always feeling protective of my husband, and would probably become defensive in this situation as well.

She knows the husband is a toxic asshat and she feels bad about it. As well she should. Shitty situation to bring a kid into, doubly so since he's a boy.", "NTA. She thinks that her husband\u2019s comment was wrong as well. She got defensive because she\u2019s not doing anything about it and someone else saying it makes it real for her.

I'm wondering if she is feeling uneasy about his patriarchal attitude.  Perhaps take some time off from her? She's being mean. \n\nNTA", "No abuse. She's an excellent mother and I think her husband is a sweetheart. I agree. I can't really do anything without grovelling and I don't want to apologise to her every single time she gets her knickers in a twist.", "Yeah! It was just an exchange of perspectives!", "Thank you for this advice. I know she has felt like people walk all over her in the past or meddle in her business. We talk about this and support each other. I never ask her anything personal about her marriage and I have said to that I will only ask \"How is the marriage going?\" once a month and wait for to be like \"It's going good!\" and leave it there. I will definitely keep my opinions to myself in the future. It is clear it is a touchy subject. I'm just annoyed that she left because now I can't even work towards a solution with her. It feels so weird.", "Literally. I felt like that was obvious from reading this. The mom deep down knows her husbands relationship with their son is not a healthy one (very little affection) and OP's comment hit a little too close to home.", "Maybe! She has never shared this concern with me, so I honestly couldn't tell you. I hope she resolves it. Her husband seems very affectionate towards his son from what I've seen....", "Maybe, thank you for pointing this out. She had the baby almost 8 months ago. I'm going to do some research to see what I can do. I feel like I should give her space right now though.", "So we've had a few disagreements because we both have very different lifestyles and views on things. She is very religious and I am not. We have worked really hard to find a no man's land where we can still have a good bond without getting into arguments. \n\nOccasionally, I'll slip up and say something inappropriate or she will say something that I'm just not cool consigning and we'll get into disagreements. Last time, I said something jokingly (I have the dumb sense of humour) \"it smells weird like a coochie or something...omg is it me?!\" and she got angry at me for using the word \"coochie\" because it's rude I guess. I didn't say this in front of my nephew but I said it in front of her and my mother. She had a go at me and snapped again. I again stonewalled her and just put on my earphones, didn't speak to her for the rest of the evening. We made up the next day and both apologised for being shitty. \n\nRegarding other people's boundaries-I'm not entirely sure what this is about either. I felt like she was just attacking me. I don't think I cross people's boundaries. When she arrived I had gotten into a tiff with my little brothers because I was upset that I had cooked and cleaned and no one really appreciated it. I said something like \"you guys don't do anything around here!\" which made them angry because honestly, I was out of line because they help out a lot. I felt a little sad because they were being cold with me and I explained to her what happened. I assume she was referring to this moment?", "I think he was kidding probably. He is a proper joker. I knew that when I made the comment. It was honestly such a light-hearted conversation.", "I'm seeing a few comments like this which is making me worried. I haven't seen a single indication of this...they seem so happy. I feel like I should ask but I also don't want to cross her boundary again...", "No she lives in a different city but she's visiting.", "This is a good point but I'm really struggling to see my sister going along with the no-hugging nonsense. Gender roles and obeying your husband, I know she follows these things to a certain extent. She's a strong woman so I don't think she would lash out just because I disagreed with her man...it's not like her. But some other people have mentioned that postpartum makes you feel a bit unlike yourself so maybe this is the reason.", "Yeah, I thought we were grown enough to have conversations about stuff like this. I think I should've not walked off maybe and asked her to explain why she was upset at me but at the same time, I was feeling really sore about some other stuff and she had already snapped a few times that week. I was over it tbh.", "I don't think she's more protective of her husband. I've seen how she's with that kid. He is the most precious thing in the world to her like you can feel the love for him radiating off her. It's so sweet. I think she's trying to control the perception of her married life and maybe felt I was overstepping with my opinion but I don't know how we're meant to communicate if I can't say anything without her feeling triggered. I wish I knew all her triggers so I could steer clear but I don't know them.", "Agree. I think this is the most likely explanation. I will give some space and follow up.", "Yes, this honestly didn't cross my mind initially. She had the baby almost 8 months ago. I don't know much about postpartum but I will research it now.", "Oh you wise person! So I went on the glorious internet and I asked dr google \"boundary vs trigger\" turns out they are very different things and people are always confusing triggers with a boundary. \n\nShe was triggered by my comment because it implied something about her parenting style and the boundary was please don't make remarks about my family and how I do things as a mother especially because we've had an unstable childhood and I worry for my son.\n\nNow, I don't ever expect people to have the right words, especially when they are in crisis but I think we're old enough to do some inside work before we go down the confrontation route. I also think she could've led with this is my boundary etc rather than \"you've crossed my boundary because you always cross boundaries because you're the sort of person who doesn't respect boundaries\" which is utterly untrue. \n\nHowever, I think I could've definitely asked more questions instead of shutting her down. I was just too emotional to speak anymore without getting angry at her. \n\nI spend hours online reading about boundaries and triggers to understand what went wrong. I don't mind doing this but I honestly kept racking my brain because I felt really emotional and like I was the villain as I'm kind of the black sheep of the family which is why I came here to get a second opinion. \n\nThank you for your comment.", "Yes, this is a very wise thing to do. I'll give her some time and then we can talk about it. \n\nJust to clarify the religious thing. Everyone in my family is religious except for me and my older brother. She's got a very welcoming and open space when it comes to her faith in our home.", "Okay, I agree. I don't want her to ruin my relationship with her over this so I'll give her space. I suppose I haven't really been trying to imagine what she's going through much. I guess it's harder when you've shared a room with someone for the first 18 years of your life. I just see her as my sister but I get she's a mother and a wife-a lot to handle on ya own!", "She's a new mom, her hormones are all over the place and she's probably hardly slept. She's defensive of everything, because her body is running on pure adrenaline. I remember those early months. If she's not usually like this, try to let moments of irrational upset go if you can. But up to a point, because anger, sometimes blinding rage, is actually one of the first and strongest symptoms of PPD in many women. Your sister might need help from a doctor. Keep an eye on her, give her grace, and remind her of your patience when you have your own \ud83d\ude02", "She is a new mom. You could consider it part of the whole not sleeping marathon...", "Another thing to think about is new parents are dealing with unsolicited advice from all sources (parents, friends, facebook etc) that might be part of the reaction coupled with sleep deprivation. I'm still tired and my son is 8 months old thought he is our second so I mostly ignore comments I don't agree with. I don't think you did anything wrong and you're doing what you can to help them.", "PPD can last a long time especially if sleep deprived. One of my children didn\u2019t start sleeping through the night until over a year old.", "This was my first thought. Maybe she\u2019s just a sleep deprived new mom who is tired of hearing everyone\u2019s opinions and needed some space \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So you dismiss her boundaries about language, dismissed her husband's POV, dismiss your brother's contribution.\n\n>she will say something that I'm just not cool consigning\n\nWhat does she do to instigate you?\n\nThere's a lot of missing context here and don't think her anger was really about one comment on cuddling", "My reading of this is that your sis may not believe her husband is joking and is likely feeling insecure about how they are going to parent together and whether there is going to be conflict about how to raise their son.", "Maybe. Possibly also if she DOESN\u2019T want to go along with her husband on no cuddling, and she\u2019s fighting a big internal struggle of her mothering instinct being at odds with her desire to obey her husband, that would exactly result in her lashing out at YOU. She knows he\u2019s wrong. You know he\u2019s wrong. You saying he\u2019s wrong forced her to acknowledge that to herself, and it\u2019s making her doubt her beliefs.", "Oooh this totally makes sense!! I think perhaps it\u2019s time for you and your sister to learn how to communicate rather than reacting/using emotions to express feelings. Over time, I\u2019ve had to learn how to articulate why I feel the way I do, and what I need/what I don\u2019t want from my husband. It has helped us so much, and I find that we fight less because both he and I know how to navigate these situations better.", "My sibling and I are very different too, but were extremely close growing up, so I have all the sympathy for both of you. I think I am more like your sister, and you would be more like my sibling. I am just having my first child (this month) and am more conservative. My sibling is very liberal and can sometimes offend me with their language and choices.\nIf it were me who offended my sibling, and I thought they were overreacting, I'd probably still send a text along the lines of \"I'm sorry I upset you, I'll try not to overstep like that in the future, I love you and want us to get along, so do you want me to leave you alone for a few days, or would you like me to send you funny memes until you're not mad at me anymore?\" \n\nI'm not quite so uptight as to get offended by the word coochie though, so idk.  Relationships are tough. I'll always love my sibling though, even if they do make me upset sometimes!", "To be fair, if you come to my house, you\u2019re getting the real me. I\u2019m not walking on egg shells to appease anyone. Go stay somewhere else if you\u2019re that easily offended.", "Well, she wants me to listen to her views on religion which I'm more than happy to do. She preaches to me often, I do not protest, I listen and ask questions. \n\nWhen I tell her about a concert I went to or an interesting cocktail I had a cool bar, a date I went on or even when I shaved the sides of my head, she'll tell me outright she doesn't want to hear anything about it because she believes listening to sinful things is being complicit. If something cool has happened and she doesn't approve, she won't share in my joy. I'm also an artist so when I paint stuff like nude bodies-she won't come near it. I basically can't talk about any aspect of my life with her because it isn't allowed in our religion and I've made my peace with this, I keep my stuff to myself. \n\nI do occasionally slip up but like I said, we've worked towards a no mans land space where we don't bring in politics, culture, religion or anything polarising. I accept that she wants to talk about religion though because sharing religious stories is also part of practising and I don't want to stop her from practising in any way. \n\nI do respect her boundaries. I don't think I have suggested that I am perfect throughout this threat. A slip-up is not the same as outright dismissing in my opinion. I guess I did dismiss her husband's POV.  Dismiss my brothers contribution-yeah I suppose I did in a way because I felt unappreciated in that moment but it wasn't right for me to say it the way I did. I can admit that and talked it out. \n\nI think you're right about it being about something more but she didn't communicate that clearly.", "Sounds like someone else already hounded her about it and you got the brunt of what was already brewing.", "NAH... You said recently she became a new mom- that comes with a flood of post-partum hormones on top of sleep deprivation. I think you should give her a pass on her reaction and acknowledge that she may not be in her most rational state right now and she may feel triggered by receiving \"parenting advice\" as a brand new mom.", "She just had a baby and might be a little sensitive. I would have just said I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to insult either of you or cross any boundaries. Then going forward keep your opinions about her, her husband and their children to yourself.", "NTA\n\nBabies need holding and cuddling.  It is healthy for their development.", "I think your sister acted defensively because you and she both know that the husband\u2019s comment \u201ctoo soft\u201d is code for \u201cgay\u201d. Your sister  doesn\u2019t want to admit her husband is homophobic, and if she goes along with his way of thinking, perhaps she is too.", "If she is reacting this strongly, it sounds like she may be scared he was serious on some level.\n\nShe may be insecure about their not seeing eye to eye on how to soothe their son. If she is, she\u2019s lashing out at the easiest person.\n\nGive her some breathing room. NTA", "NTA - her husband is a crappy dad and you are absolutely correct.  Her husband needs to learn about the kids that were in orphanages and got minimal human contact and how that worked out.\n\nWhen your sister gets over this \"slight\", the next time something like this comes up, instead of countering the \"advice from the useless father\", softly question it?  Not \"WHY WOULD HE THINK THAT?\", rather, \"I've never heard that before and I'm confused, what does it mean to \"be soft\"? and if that goes well, continue with the gentle probing - \"if too much cuddling is bad, then how do you show a child that they are loved and safe?\"  \"Why is it important to restricting children's emotions?\"    Keep your tone gentle and inquisitive such that you are only seeking the oh so great wisdom that your sister has.  But in reality, your questions are meant to get your sister thinking on her own understand how her husbands toxic behavior is going to cause problems for her sweet baby.", "Yeah your sister acts like how my sister, who is in an abusive relationship acts. My sister will share something about her kids Dad, and even if you respond something intending it to be a compliment, if she feels even slightly judged she'll go off on you. It's projection because deep down they know something isn't right and they want that validation and fear it at the same time. \n\nIn this case she knows it's weird for a parent to suggest, however jokingly, that you deprive a baby from love so they don't \"turn out soft\". She felt like your response validated her gut feeling that's not cool for a parent to say, so she went off on you. Because if the situation is that you're too judgemental, then she doesn't have to deal with it. NTA but I would leave your sister to it and practise greyrock or non-committal responses. If she's being secretive with her marriage - they have a kid together and you still barely know her husband - then there's a reason behind it but it might  be best to stay out of it for now. When she's ready to open up she will.", "NTA. This could very well be hormones and sleep deprivation, or you're getting the aftereffects of perhaps a conversation she had with husband about this earlier that got ugly.\n\nFor the record, you are correct for what it's worth (not much here I'm afraid) hugging your child doesn't make them \"soft\", it just makes it so they know their dad loves them. It's good for bonding and many cases, improves an infant's physical health. I wouldn't call it a \"red flag\" exactly, but it is kind of a flag.

She likely may have been fighting with her hubby, and you hit a nerve. Doesn't make her right.

Hopefully, she'll open up, and you can be there to help if and when she needs it.", "NTA. However some understanding could be helpful here. New parents, especially new moms, are often self-conscious about their parenting as they\u2019re still finding their footing and there\u2019s a lot of unwanted advice and pressure coming from family, friends, social media, the internet in general, etc. I think this causes them to get a little defensive and I think maybe that\u2019s what happened here. I sometimes have to catch myself and stop myself from being overly sensitive when someone makes a joke about something parenting-related to me.\n\nMaybe try to reassure her that you weren\u2019t commenting on her and her husbands parenting and that you think they\u2019re great parents. I\u2019m sure that would be very appreciated!", "Nta, don\u2019t give her the grovelling apology she\u2019s looking for. It\u2019s not fair to feel like you have to constantly be walking on eggshells, don\u2019t let it be a cycle.

You didn't know you were crossing a boundary. She probably didn't realize it was a boundary for her until after the fact. Hormones and erratic sleep schedules can really take a toll (esp if she's breastfeeding too). \n\nSibling relationships are so interesting. My older brother only blows up at my immediate family. And it took me a while to realize that sometimes, we lose our tempers/filters around people who we feel secure around - the people we believe love us unconditionally. It sucks to be on the receiving end and doesn't justify her behavior, but with that idea in mind, it's made it easier for me to not take things too personally, even in the moment. Watched a really interesting talk on psychology of sibling relationships and can share if it's of any interest", "NTA because it was meant in jest and you had no reason to expect it would be received otherwise.  The fallout is strange and I\u2019m not gonna make assumptions but based on my experience, hormones can make new mamas react in ways even they may not expect.  She\u2019s probably questioning every move right now and her mind read this wrong. Maybe a comment about how strong she is and how proud you are could make her feel more supported and give her a boost any sane new mom needs.", "NTA, but first-time mothers of newborns are clinically insane from sleep deprivation and stress.

You\u2019ve touched a nerve, but it\u2019s her issue. \n\nSomeone once said to me that the things we react strongest to, are often truths. Like, if someone calls you a liar but you know that you aren\u2019t one, then you\u2019ll probably be able to shake it off. But if someone calls you a liar and you kind of are one, it will probably hurt you. Maybe deep down, your sister knows that there was some truth to your comment and so went into defence mode. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you were bitching or judging\u2026 you were just making sure that your nephew has access to hugs.", "NTA.

Giving a child love doesn\u2019t make them soft. And it\u2019s really weird your sister got upset about that.", "NTA\n\nNot a lot to work with, but from what you wrote, I'm guessing this has been a long-standing issue with them. Maybe not even this particular thing but parenting in general. She seems to sensitive and quick to resort to aggression in defending him, as if she's been dealing with internal and external struggles for a while. It doesn't help that the husband's comment was iffy... if it were a window to his character, some reflection and therapy might help them. Or... nuclear option, if stubborn.", "NTA, but I won\u2019t so quickly jump to say that she is, either. Perhaps she feels the same way you do about her husband\u2019s comment, maybe she even resents or feels angry with him about it, but she\u2019s taking it out on you because that\u2019s easier than causing potential problems in her marriage. Is it right for her to do this? No, but she may feel like she can\u2019t raise these concerns with her husband, whether it be out of fear of his reaction or out of efforts to not rock the boat.", "I\u2019m with you in seeing it all as a miscommunication. She did take things way out of proportion. You\u2019re NTA for that. A simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and moving forward should fix this issue. If it doesn\u2019t, then ignore it and move on. She\u2019ll eventually get over it, especially because said your peace.", "NTA. New parents, especially for their first are so annoying lol. Let her have her fit and get over it.

I'm sure your sister will come back around", "NTA. \n\nPregnancy and motherhood is hard, and your sister may be sensitive to what \\*feels\\* like criticism of her husband or their family, even if it was just an innocent comment. \n\nAn additional thought to consider: \"You have no right to tell me what to do\" usually means someone is already trying to tell her what to do. If not the husband, my guess is in-laws. What your sister said about boundaries and her choice to suddenly leave the house sounds similar to strategies shared in communities like JustNoMIL, RaisedByNarcissists, etc. If this is the case, your sister may feel like her boundaries aren't being respected as a mom elsewhere in her life and lashed out at you to reassert herself and vent that frustration.\n\nWhatever is going on, I hope you two are able to patch things up and enjoy the baby cuddles!", "I just see her as my sister but I get she's a mother and a wife-a lot to handle on ya own!", "I wouldn't call it a \"red flag\" exactly, but it is kind of a flag.

Dont be \"soft,\" but be the strong stoic emotionless pillar that most men are depicted as.\nI get where her husband is coming from. Its nowhere near abusive and i have no clue where you got that idea. Husbands thought process is probably rooted in the idea that men should provide  and protect their family at all times and this cant be \"soft:", "Yupp, her husband, was probably raised with the idea that men must be \"strong\" so as to provide for his family. Too much cuddling would be seen as making him too soft and affecting his ability be the protector men have been seen as for hundreds or thousands of years.", "Sister def fears judgement about something/is feeling insecure about something.", "Yeah I think this is wise.

She probably wanted to say something more to her husband about the comment but didn't so the frustration came out with me.", "I sometimes act like my POV is the better one or my opinion is more sound than hers. I think I have really pissed her off by speaking over her when she's tried to talk about something in the past.\n\nI guess she was trying to assert herself but it went left because she asserted herself in a situation that didn't really call for assertiveness and then just confused the hell of me. My mom is also a big OTT grandma that tells her what to do a lot and we've all taken turns to tell my mom to back off. I guess spending so much time with us all has been overwhelming for her.", "This is really helpful, thank you.

I've moved back to our home town now. \n\nThere is also the whole religious aspect-men and women's separate thingy and because I dress however I please, I keep my distance out of respect for her and him. I know they appreciate it but it means I cannot get to know him unless we chat through a door or curtain which I'm very much up for if it means I know who this dude raising my nephew is. So far he has been very kind to me. He's always trying to make us laugh. He seems like a good human but like someone else mentioned, I don't know what is happening behind closed doors. I really hope all is well.", "If that's the case, I hope she'll talk to me about it. I would do pretty much anything for her.", "Ahhh it didn't feel gaslight-y. I've been gaslit before and that wasn't it.", "But its not this generation. Or the one before!! I'm Gen X and all my friends' hub are involved and cuddly.

But I could be reading into things too much.", " I'm going to play devil's advocate a little here. But something is off. She may be feeling insecure and reacting to everybody giving her unsolicited advice but at the same time never take somebody at face failure. You know what this guy shows you. Not what he's doing behind closed doors. He does not have to be  physically aggressive or assault her to be abusive. It could just be how he's speaking to her.  If your absolutely sure he's not abusive and she keeps doing that, personally I'd ask him what's up. She might be doing the same with him and it's very possible she could have postpartum depression or anxiety. Tread lightly. But NTA\n\nEdit: after going through a little bit more of this thread and reading some of your responses to other comments it also is possible that she views your opinion as worldly and a challenge to her very religious lifestyle. But I still stand by the possibility that a things could not be great in her marriage as it seems which makes sense now that she would hide that and or she has some ppd/ ppa thing going on.   This may just be a mix of stuff. But if I were you I wouldn't walk on eggshells with her. That's not fair to you. I would let her know you love her you respect her personal choices and views but you don't feel that she's doing the same for you. And that instead of snapping at you whenever she is upset by a comment she should instead take a moment and explain why the common bothers her.  And you should also take a moment to have some retrospect on how you respond.

It was sometimes hard to tell what statements would upset her, but just like your sister she is an excellent mother and my brother is amazing. It really was the overwhelming feeling of new motherhood coupled with PPD and the feeling of EVERYONE having a comment all the time. \n\nI supported her (and avoided the wrath lol) by just being patient and careful about what I said. I never gave suggestions about what she should do or talked about how I used to do things. If she directly asked for advice I would give it but not otherwise.

Answer me this would you want her son to turn out like her husband or do you on some level think her husband is controlling and wish her son was different. Your comment crossed the boundary of how she views her husband and it may be that it reflects poorly on the type of person he actually is.

So your sister and her spouse do not have to worry about making the baby soft. If the baby is soft it is already inside him. I have a softy stepson and it is just how he is (he is the best).

What happens if he is an introvert? If he wants to drink a cosmo instead of a beer? If he is worried now about CUDDLING AN INFANT... that is a huge massive red flag. People who think things like that do not possess unconditional love for their child.

I know some of you advised me not to do that but I didn\u2019t want to fall out over something as small as this. I also commented on her being a good mum and that I proud her and her husband have done such a great job which I honestly believe is true. My nephew is such a smiley baby. \n\nShe mentioned that she didn\u2019t like that I talked about her parenting style and that her husband can do whatever he wants which made me roll my eyes not going to lie\u2026I personally feel that is a slippery slope but it\u2019s not my marriage. \n\nShe added that at times my tone can come off very shitty and that I should watch how I say things to people. I do think she\u2019s on to something there, I have been told by a few people before the way I say things makes them feel some type of way. I asked my mum about it and she said I project my voice and I\u2019m quick witted. I know why I am like that but I guess I need to monitor how I talk to people as I\u2019ve had this feedback a few times. \n\nI did kind of regret apologising again because I felt she was being a little self-righteous about it. She said that I should spend some time talking to other people in my family about their boundaries and get to know them because I\u2019ve just moved back home and I have been away for a while. This way I could avoid this happening again. \n\nI do think all of this happened because she is hormonal, exhausted and is sensitive. I don\u2019t really know what to make of the comments on my personality other than just be a bit more self aware. I\u2019m trying to keep my ego in check here but damn it\u2019s hard. \n\nShe did add that she thinks I have the best intentions and she loves me. For added context my older brother who also lives at home does not get a long with her. They don\u2019t acknowledge each other in the house at all which is toxic af. My brother will only come and hold my nephew when my sister has gone to shower or make his food or something. And as soon as she returns he\u2019ll hand the baby back to me and walk away. My sister expressed that she found this to be unacceptable because her son is at a stage where he is learning social cues and picking up on vibes. She doesn\u2019t want him to be exposed to that kind of vibe. This part of the reason why she left the house. I got to say I wholeheartedly agree with her on this one. I don\u2019t know much about babies but protecting her son from bad vibes is definitely a green flag in my book. Kids are impressionable. Unfortunately, she\u2019s said she won\u2019t be coming back to visit for a while and if she does it will be for a much shorter period of time but she\u2019s not sure yet. \n\nI haven\u2019t replied yet as I\u2019m still working out how I feel about what she said. I\u2019m not mad or hurt though and I understand where she is coming from. She has given me a lot to think about but it\u2019s just A LOT. \n\nThank you all for your thoughtful, insightful comments. I appreciate it because I have never really asked for second opinion on my relationship with my sister and I can see now there are some massive issues that need to be resolved. I do think some of y\u2019all are maybe jumping to the worst case scenario a little too eagerly e.g. abuse. However, I will keep it in mind and look out for signs.

Her husband sounds pretty hard core.", "When I see \"religious lifestyle\" and \"be strict with your child to not make it soft\", all the alarm sirens and red blinking lights start playing in my head.  \nI remember this \"christian\" book for parents, which teached the parents how to beat their children. I read fragments in the internet. It was awful og disgusting sadistic stuff. Something like:  \n\"show your baby the attractive toy in some distance and say \"no\", forbidding the baby to reach for it. When the baby happily starts to crawl in this direction, you beat it with a thin rod and say \"no\" again.

It\u2019s definitely a yellow-orange flag at least.", "Wow. I really respect what your saying about yourself. You\u2019re very honest about not giving your brothers proper credit. You\u2019re honest about your screw ups.  You\u2019re thoughtful. You\u2019re considerate. But you\u2019re also strong and know your worth and won\u2019t take crap. \n\nThis is actually what religion should have us aspire to be.  True. Honest. To have clarity of mind and peace in the heart.  \n\nBut it sounds like your sister is part of an organized religion almost identical in significant ways to one I grew up in. \n\nI\u2019m an odd case because my mom was religious and made me go to a very strict Southern Baptist church and youth program, but then I would go home and my \u201cheathen\u201d dad with his completely inappropriate sense of humor would deprogram me to an extent.  And my mom also couldn\u2019t ever really shake her Asian Pacific tribal style spirituality that taught even the rocks and trees had something akin to a soul.  That resonates with me but it was anathema to my Sunday school teachers. \n\nGetting back to my dad for a minute, I actually thought he was an atheist because he had to be dragged to attend our church once or twice a year.  But over the years I got to know he was Christian in all the ways that counted. Later my mom saw all the hypocrisy and the way her church was twisting her and after I got sexually harassed by a youth minister and quit, she quit with me. That was a little over 40 years ago. \n\nI still have faith but it\u2019s more grounded in treating people in my life like I really love them instead of constantly measuring them up against some standard nobody can attain, least of all myself, even if I do believe in Jesus and all that.  \n\nMy best \u201cfellowship\u201d is with a Hindu friend. We have so much common ground in our different faiths and we are also absolutely honest about the foibles and dangers and harm in blind adherence to the dogma.  I shudder to think how I would have missed out on this friendship if I were still strictly adhered to my old church\u2019s rules. \n\nThis is the second post on this sub today that I\u2019ve seen where a religious person absolutely puts their non religious \u201csignificant person\u201d (that one was about best friends) in no win situations. It saddens me. \n\nI think, this isn\u2019t about the cuddles or the baby, per se. I think it\u2019s about your sister\u2019s overwhelming need to overwhelm you.  This isn\u2019t the first fight she\u2019s picked with you where she\u2019s trying to get some form of capitulation from you.  This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s maneuvered herself onto higher ground over you. I think she\u2019s been boiling the frog slowly for a long time.  And now, probably due to sleep deprivation and hormones, she\u2019s slipped up and turned the heat up too intensely and her little frog finally noticed.  \n\nThat\u2019s not to say that other people are wrong or misguided in what they\u2019re conjecturing.  Many things can be true at once about this situation.  But it sticks out to me that your sister keeps finding the effective words to silence you.  \n\nYou\u2019re NOT an AH. And you\u2019re not TA.  You\u2019re a vibrant, funny good sister.  As a Christian who gets so much out of my faith, it deeply pains me to see the damage adherence to dogma does to relationships with people who are worth knowing and worth loving just as they are.  Lol and I think your comments about \u201ccoochie\u201d are hilarious!  I\u2019m an only child but if I could have had a sister I\u2019d want her to be like you.  I hope your sister wakes up to what she has in you. She\u2019s freaking lucky to have you.  The real sin would be to judge you away.", "Self awareness is key.

I'm sure you can find videos on YouTube. \n\nIn the future, rather than make a personal statement (\"don't let your husband dictate your actions\"), try \"wasn't there a study done on that? Pretty sure I read about them and they proved pretty conclusively that withholding affection is detrimental.\"\n\nNothing that can be seen as a personal attack or a critique of her marriage, her husband or their parenting skills. Just passing on information. \n\nBut yeah, postpartum is a minefield. The more often you can just be positive and reassuring, the better, especially with first time parents. So another response could have been \"pfffft, go ahead and cuddle the baby! You're doing a great job.\" and leave it at that.\n\nNo AH here, just some stress, sleep deprivation and hormones.
