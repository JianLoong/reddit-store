I was also born on Christmas Day, and for the first full year of my life I had medical problems. I spent my first weeks in an incubator and, several months later was re-hospitalized for weeks because of an infection and a severe allergic reaction to antibiotics.All of this was really hard on my sister (34f). She struggled during those years to get the attention she needed and my parents/ family doted on me because I was everyone's \"miracle baby.\" She developed some serious behavioral issues because of it, which my parents tried to address.\n\nHowever. To me, the course correction was extreme. We stopped celebrating my birthday altogether when I was around 9 or 10, because it was \"too hard\" for my sister to share Christmas with my birthday. From elementary school through high school, my parents never attended soccer games or school plays. They even missed my high school award ceremony where I won 2 awards. The reasons were usually things like \"Your sister has a therapy appointment\" or \"your sister isn't feeling well.\" When I graduated high school, everyone went out to my sister's favorite restaurant (that I didn't like) to celebrate that my sister was home for the occasion.\n\nParing down for word count, but one more example: when my sis graduated college, my whole family had a blowout party and my wealthy cousins paid off her student loans as a graduation gift. When I graduated, no one even attended the ceremony except my mom and dad, even though I graduated with dual majors, a 4.0, and 4 academic awards.\n\nRecently, I was at a family gathering, and the conversation came around to children. My sister has 4 kids, whereas I'm childfree. My BIL made a comment about how hard it is for the older siblings to adjust to the new kids, and my sister got really teary-eyed and emotional. She talked about how \"traumatic\" it was for her that I was born on Christmas and she had to miss that \"milestone\" with her parents and spend it with her aunt instead, and how hard it was to be the \"forgotten child\" and to have a sibling that was obviously the \"favorite\" and the \"Golden Child.\"My mom also got teary-eyed and apologized, saying she was so sorry for how hard it was for her, etc. Then my sister looked at me with this angry, disgusted look, and said something like \"and never expect the Golden Child to apologize for it.\" \n\nI honestly f\\*cking lost it. I said (yelled) that my entire family has basically ignored my existence for my entire life and that I hated every single person in the room.Since my outburst, literally no one is on my side, and my parents think I'm being insensitive to what my sister went through.

It appears that they do not settle in a happy medium but are constantly trying to \u201cover correct\u201d to an extreme.  There is not a single reason to not celebrate your birthday\u2014even a day or two later or earlier if they want to preserve Christmas.  There is not a single reason that one couldn\u2019t attend your important events while the other went to your sister\u2019s.  There isn\u2019t a single reason not to give you both graduation parties.  There isn\u2019t a single reason that they couldn\u2019t divide stuff up to make it more even\u2014i.e. come to see you for Christmas and her for New Year\u2019s\u2014or to make separate times special.\n\nYour parents are triangulating.  They are ***DELIBERATELY*** setting up the situation so that you and sis ***CANNOT*** form a bond.  First one kid is the favorite.  Then the second kid, while making sure the first know that they aren\u2019t the favorite.  Then reverse so that second kid can\u2019t get a break and fawn all over the first one.  Reverse.  Rinse and repeat.  I\u2019m going to bet that when the \u201cgrandkids\u201d are no longer interested in knowing them, suddenly they will remember you and how you needed them.  So they will come running to you, all apologize and \u201cwe realize we weren\u2019t there for you\u201d and then you will be expected to just open your arms and let them into your life.

I will equally predict that if you suddenly had grandchildren, there would be a sudden reversal there as well.\n\nYou will notice that they have already brought in flying monkeys who will not offer a differing opinion.  That your whole family went along with whatever they wanted.  That no one tried to offer you a Christmas cake or came by with a birthday cupcake.  That NO ONE came by when you had a 4.0 (congrats) and awards.  Why wasn\u2019t there an aunt or cousin or grandparent there?

I've always been really academic, and my parents missed the award ceremonies during my 5th grade graduation (from elementary school to middle school), 8th grade graduation, and 12th grade graduation - and I won awards at each of those ceremonies. They also missed 2 college award ceremonies. And my sister got to go abroad twice in high school for school trips, but I was told we couldn't afford it. \n\nI did not have birthday parties at all beyond childhood. There were 2 attempts to have a party for me in the summer, but that stopped by age 11-12. In fact, between ages 17-22 I went through a phase where I would buy myself a cake at Christmas and passive-aggressively eat it by myself and everyone would just act like it wasn't happening. Once after my niece was born my dad tried to go get a birthday cake on Christmas for me and my sister had a meltdown and insisted he didn't so that we didn't \"spoil\" Christmas for my niece by \"making it about me.\"", "Also, I may not have made it clear in the post - it's not about a \"missed graduation\" 20 years ago. This is still the relationship that I have with my family. After my parents retired, they moved across the country to live closer to my sister, so I only see the family once or twice a year. When I call them, they just talk at me for an hour about everything new with my sister, and barely even ask me about my life. They've never met my partner even though we've been together for 5 years and live together. And I'm really career-focused and have a great job, but the last time I went to visit my mom, she literally forgot what my job was and said something like \"it's hard to keep up with current events,\" even though I've been in that field for almost a decade. For me, this isn't about some childhood injustice.

The entire situation sucked for everyone involved, but no one is to blame. The problem now is that your parents and sister are carrying that trauma with them in their everyday life as it happened to them - your sister is still hurting as a 2yo (or whatever tf cause I call BS on this) who felt neglected while your parents cared for you.

They were devastated and tried fertility treatments for 15 years. Finally, around \\~40, my dad had surgery and they were able to have my sister. They were told not to have any more kids, but they wanted to try again because they'd always wanted a big family. They had a bad miscarriage and my mom almost died, but despite that they tried once more time and had me. I was premature and almost didn't make it, and it was a difficult pregnancy for my mom, so it was \"miraculous\" that I was born. Sorry if all of that was misleading in the post", "I guess that's true. I'm not trying to argue about the status of \"rainbow baby,\" just reporting on what the narrative is in my family haha. I was the miraculous baby because they didn't think they could have another kid after my sister, and because I almost didn't make it after birth. That's the family story, and I'm just repeating it, if that makes sense", "Rainbow baby is a baby born after miscarriage/loss. It doesn't matter (for the sake of being a rainbow baby or not) how much trouble the parents had conceiving the sister nor for how many years. If they didn't have a miscarriage before giving birth to sister. Than sister is NOT a rainbow baby. (Btw a simple Google search of rainbow baby could have told you this as well, but there you go). Anyway NTA OP", "I think there are some mischaracterizations here, unintentional ones.\n\nI don't think you were ever the rainbow baby, though every baby is a miracle. Your sister was the one they had after 15 years of struggling with infertility. She is the rainbow baby, which I think would predispose her to be the \"golden child\" in the family, not you. She's just calling you that because you are both dealing with trauma over not having enough parental attention and fighting to get it.\n\nAnd as for who is the \"golden child\" I think to me it sounds less like there was a Golden Child and more like when you were young, you had a lot of serious medical issues. That wasn't your fault. But a consequence of this was that your parents had to divert attention from your sister to care for you. As a result, this caused trauma to your sister and mental health issues--which manifested when she was older. \n\nSo fast forward a few years later when YOU were physically healthy and your parents were probably like phew, we can get our lives back on track, it was like not so fast, because your sister now had mental health issues due to their neglect (not their fault, but it is what it is.) So they had to do a huge course correct and suddenly just like they were devoting all their attention to you when you were sick when you were young, they were devoting all their attention to her at that phase in her life, trying to fix her issues. But of course, that then turned around and caused trauma and mental health problems for you as an adult.\n\nI don't know what to tell you as for a solution. I would think the question of whether a solution is possible really lies with whether your mom and sister are interested in changing their behavior. Do they care that it hurts you that mom has never met your partner in 5 years? Have you told your mom not to drone on about your sister for an hour and to ask about your life sometimes and she still talks about your sister? If she truly doesn't care, then painful as it is, I might go low/no contact. If they are interested in doing better, I would try to clearly explain what you need from them in the present (I would love for you to meet partner) without dragging the past into it.)", "I'm not trying to argue that your birth was wonderful and they were lucky to have another child at their ages and after a miscarriage... but I think you should rethink the term rainbow baby for two reasons... it usually refers to a baby that has been conceived after a hard struggle with infertility... and this baby is often turned into the golden child--which your sister has been as the adult. Your sister is the rainbow baby in your family of origin, not you (She is the one it took them 15 years to conceive), and as an adult, she is their golden child.", "A rainbow baby is specifically a term for a baby born after a miscarriage or stillbirth. So yes, she was a rainbow baby. They could both be rainbow babies if there were miscarriages as a part of their fertility journey but just because they did fertility treatments to conceive the older one doesn't make her a rainbow baby.", "It's a specific term for having a baby after miscarriage. OP says she was born after a miscarriage, so hence that. Fertility isusses (or not) have no bearing on being a rainbow baby. It's having another baby after a previous pregnancy loss that makes someone a rainbow baby (but obviously not neccessarily the golden child)"]}
