I was also born on Christmas Day, and for the first full year of my life I had medical problems. I spent my first weeks in an incubator and, several months later was re-hospitalized for weeks because of an infection and a severe allergic reaction to antibiotics.All of this was really hard on my sister (34f). She struggled during those years to get the attention she needed and my parents/ family doted on me because I was everyone's \"miracle baby.\" She developed some serious behavioral issues because of it, which my parents tried to address.\n\nHowever. To me, the course correction was extreme. We stopped celebrating my birthday altogether when I was around 9 or 10, because it was \"too hard\" for my sister to share Christmas with my birthday. From elementary school through high school, my parents never attended soccer games or school plays. They even missed my high school award ceremony where I won 2 awards. The reasons were usually things like \"Your sister has a therapy appointment\" or \"your sister isn't feeling well.\" When I graduated high school, everyone went out to my sister's favorite restaurant (that I didn't like) to celebrate that my sister was home for the occasion.\n\nParing down for word count, but one more example: when my sis graduated college, my whole family had a blowout party and my wealthy cousins paid off her student loans as a graduation gift. When I graduated, no one even attended the ceremony except my mom and dad, even though I graduated with dual majors, a 4.0, and 4 academic awards.\n\nRecently, I was at a family gathering, and the conversation came around to children. My sister has 4 kids, whereas I'm childfree. My BIL made a comment about how hard it is for the older siblings to adjust to the new kids, and my sister got really teary-eyed and emotional. She talked about how \"traumatic\" it was for her that I was born on Christmas and she had to miss that \"milestone\" with her parents and spend it with her aunt instead, and how hard it was to be the \"forgotten child\" and to have a sibling that was obviously the \"favorite\" and the \"Golden Child.\"My mom also got teary-eyed and apologized, saying she was so sorry for how hard it was for her, etc. Then my sister looked at me with this angry, disgusted look, and said something like \"and never expect the Golden Child to apologize for it.\" \n\nI honestly f\\*cking lost it. I said (yelled) that my entire family has basically ignored my existence for my entire life and that I hated every single person in the room.Since my outburst, literally no one is on my side, and my parents think I'm being insensitive to what my sister went through.

It appears that they do not settle in a happy medium but are constantly trying to \u201cover correct\u201d to an extreme.  There is not a single reason to not celebrate your birthday\u2014even a day or two later or earlier if they want to preserve Christmas.  There is not a single reason that one couldn\u2019t attend your important events while the other went to your sister\u2019s.

There isn\u2019t a single reason that they couldn\u2019t divide stuff up to make it more even\u2014i.e. come to see you for Christmas and her for New Year\u2019s\u2014or to make separate times special.\n\nYour parents are triangulating.  They are ***DELIBERATELY*** setting up the situation so that you and sis ***CANNOT*** form a bond.  First one kid is the favorite.  Then the second kid, while making sure the first know that they aren\u2019t the favorite.  Then reverse so that second kid can\u2019t get a break and fawn all over the first one.  Reverse.  Rinse and repeat.  I\u2019m going to bet that when the \u201cgrandkids\u201d are no longer interested in knowing them, suddenly they will remember you and how you needed them.  So they will come running to you, all apologize and \u201cwe realize we weren\u2019t there for you\u201d and then you will be expected to just open your arms and let them into your life.  If sis decides to go against them\u2014i.e. don\u2019t pay for something for them, don\u2019t let them move in, not let them into holiday plans\u2014it will trigger them to come to you.  I will equally predict that if you suddenly had grandchildren, there would be a sudden reversal there as well.\n\nYou will notice that they have already brought in flying monkeys who will not offer a differing opinion.  That your whole family went along with whatever they wanted.  That no one tried to offer you a Christmas cake or came by with a birthday cupcake.  That NO ONE came by when you had a 4.0 (congrats) and awards.  Why wasn\u2019t there an aunt or cousin or grandparent there?

They also missed 2 college award ceremonies. And my sister got to go abroad twice in high school for school trips, but I was told we couldn't afford it. \n\nI did not have birthday parties at all beyond childhood. There were 2 attempts to have a party for me in the summer, but that stopped by age 11-12. In fact, between ages 17-22 I went through a phase where I would buy myself a cake at Christmas and passive-aggressively eat it by myself and everyone would just act like it wasn't happening. Once after my niece was born my dad tried to go get a birthday cake on Christmas for me and my sister had a meltdown and insisted he didn't so that we didn't \"spoil\" Christmas for my niece by \"making it about me.\"", "Also, I may not have made it clear in the post - it's not about a \"missed graduation\" 20 years ago. This is still the relationship that I have with my family. After my parents retired, they moved across the country to live closer to my sister, so I only see the family once or twice a year. When I call them, they just talk at me for an hour about everything new with my sister, and barely even ask me about my life. They've never met my partner even though we've been together for 5 years and live together. And I'm really career-focused and have a great job, but the last time I went to visit my mom, she literally forgot what my job was and said something like \"it's hard to keep up with current events,\" even though I've been in that field for almost a decade.

The problem now is that your parents and sister are carrying that trauma with them in their everyday life as it happened to them - your sister is still hurting as a 2yo (or whatever tf cause I call BS on this) who felt neglected while your parents cared for you.

They were devastated and tried fertility treatments for 15 years. Finally, around \\~40, my dad had surgery and they were able to have my sister. They were told not to have any more kids, but they wanted to try again because they'd always wanted a big family. They had a bad miscarriage and my mom almost died, but despite that they tried once more time and had me. I was premature and almost didn't make it, and it was a difficult pregnancy for my mom, so it was \"miraculous\" that I was born.

It doesn't matter (for the sake of being a rainbow baby or not) how much trouble the parents had conceiving the sister nor for how many years. If they didn't have a miscarriage before giving birth to sister. Than sister is NOT a rainbow baby. (Btw a simple Google search of rainbow baby could have told you this as well, but there you go). Anyway NTA OP", "I think there are some mischaracterizations here, unintentional ones.\n\nI don't think you were ever the rainbow baby, though every baby is a miracle. Your sister was the one they had after 15 years of struggling with infertility. She is the rainbow baby, which I think would predispose her to be the \"golden child\" in the family, not you. She's just calling you that because you are both dealing with trauma over not having enough parental attention and fighting to get it.\n\nAnd as for who is the \"golden child\" I think to me it sounds less like there was a Golden Child and more like when you were young, you had a lot of serious medical issues. That wasn't your fault. But a consequence of this was that your parents had to divert attention from your sister to care for you. As a result, this caused trauma to your sister and mental health issues--which manifested when she was older. \n\nSo fast forward a few years later when YOU were physically healthy and your parents were probably like phew, we can get our lives back on track, it was like not so fast, because your sister now had mental health issues due to their neglect (not their fault, but it is what it is.) So they had to do a huge course correct and suddenly just like they were devoting all their attention to you when you were sick when you were young, they were devoting all their attention to her at that phase in her life, trying to fix her issues. But of course, that then turned around and caused trauma and mental health problems for you as an adult.\n\nI don't know what to tell you as for a solution. I would think the question of whether a solution is possible really lies with whether your mom and sister are interested in changing their behavior. Do they care that it hurts you that mom has never met your partner in 5 years? Have you told your mom not to drone on about your sister for an hour and to ask about your life sometimes and she still talks about your sister? If she truly doesn't care, then painful as it is, I might go low/no contact. If they are interested in doing better, I would try to clearly explain what you need from them in the present (I would love for you to meet partner) without dragging the past into it.)", "I'm not trying to argue that your birth was wonderful and they were lucky to have another child at their ages and after a miscarriage... but I think you should rethink the term rainbow baby for two reasons... it usually refers to a baby that has been conceived after a hard struggle with infertility... and this baby is often turned into the golden child--which your sister has been as the adult.

No one forced you to interact with them", "NTA. I'm so sorry. It doesn't sound like you were the \"golden child\" at all. It sounds like you got more attention when you were sick - which is COMPLETELY NORMAL AND NECESSARY - and your sister couldn't handle it or have any empathy for the situation, so they turned you into the black sheep. Your sister sounds like a huge manipulator.\n\nIt might be worth laying out all the examples you've given in your post in a letter or email to them - a format in which you can say your piece without interruption - and see how they respond. Maybe they'll understand and you can start working towards a healthier family structure. Maybe they won't, and in that case it would be fully understandable for you to cut contact to none/minimal with these people and focus on moving forward with your own life.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if you have some abandonment issues, and if that's the case I hope you find the love and support you need. You sound like an intelligent, contributory member of society and I wish you all the best for your future.", "NTA Go full no contact.", "Talk about gaslighting. The actual golden child putting that responsibility on the one who clearly had to play seconds every second of her life. Huge NTA.", "OP, you were not the golden child. Your sister was the golden child. She literally got your parents to stop celebrating your birthday because it was hard on her.  \n\nNTA", "Girl go no contact with your family.", "This may be unpopular but I feel like this is an ESH. With the order of suckiness, in decreasing order, being: your parents, you, and then your sister. \n\nYour parents suck for calling their third child, you, a rainbow baby, even though you were born technically after a miscarriage, because they already had one living child, so it wasn\u2019t as if they had none. And, in doing so, they suck for creating conflict between their kids. \n\nYou suck because this whole thing seems to much like \u201cMe, Me, Me\u201d. And while to a certain extent it is justified, it is also to a certain extent not. What I am mainly referring to is one of your main comments when you are talking about Christmas and having to spend time with your aunt, instead of your parents and sister. News flash. That is one day a year. Your sister most likely had to spend so many days (maybe even most of the year) without her parents, or at least neglected by them, while they were looking after you, and in her formative years (3-5), which is a crucial time from a psychological stand point for children to come out secure and without issues. And you don\u2019t seem to have any sympathy for that whatsoever in here.\nAnd Christmas now a days is mostly materialistic, don\u2019t act like it isn\u2019t, so if this is all about not getting presents because it is \u201cher day\u201d, then drop it. Everyone is entitled to a single day a year which is all about them. If you still get your day, then she is entitled to hers even if it is Christmas.\n\nYour sister sucks though for making you feel as if you couldn\u2019t be there on Christmas, not to mention making your parents pick her health over your other life events\u2026.though, that is also partially on your parents to because they should have had your events in the calendar to and should have not scheduled each child\u2019s event in conflict of one of the others. How much knowledge your sister had of that going on those is unknown\u2026Maybe she was ignorant of it?", "'t go to your soccer games? Boo hoo. Not celebrating your birthday how you think it should? Stop Whining. Old news. You're an adult now. Move on. You got the absolute best of your parents when you were sick. You're not sick anymore.  Your sister has 4 kids. If one of them got sick, wouldn't she move heaven and earth to see that that child got the care they needed? I guess that would make that child a \"goden child{. You got your student loans paid off. Who's the golden child now? Next time she calls you the golden child, smile, say, \"yes I was\" But, I'm an adult now, nobody\\[s child. Nothing to apologize for. I got the love when I needed it and you got the love when you needed it.", " YTA You hate all of these people, why not call it a day and leave them alone? What is the point really?", "I was thinking the same thing if anything the parents probably wanted to spend the holiday with her and her younger sister or with younger sister waiting to be born/not causing the mom to go into labor", "Most children who are second fiddle to the golden child make good grades to compensate and to force some small attention back their way. And yet again, most kids that I grew up with got a small acknowledgement on their \"Christmas birthday\" and a party over the weekend before Christmas because that's when most parents would want to celebrate with the children's friends. (Being the following weekend is NYE)", "This. In technical terms, it sounds like you are more the black sheep than the GC, and that your family has gaslighted you about it.", "That's exactly what I was thinking, it's so surprising how nobody had picked up on this evern after she pointed it out. Sister just loves the attention", "Golden Child =/= kid who got more help\n\nA golden child is the kid who messed up the least. The kid who needs the least help. \n\nOPs sister sounds like the first born. Lots of trouble and lots of effort.", "\u201cLet me play ye a song on the world\u2019s tiniest violin!\u201d", "His GC status lasted until he was 9 or 10, with his sister complaining bitterly.  Then all caring stopped and was given to his sister instead.", "My brother was born on Christmas and it was the best Christmas! Sure my mom and dad had to leave but when they came back, I had a little brother! At the time, I had no idea that we were opening presents at 3am but my mom went into labour and wanted to make sure she was there to see us open gifts. \n\nIt's definitely on the parents for ruining it", "Nah this all sounds made up!  They\u2019re two years apart, meaning sister would have been 2yo when OP was born.  That kid didn\u2019t know her sister was born on Christmas or care.  They could have celebrated it a month later and the 2yo wouldn\u2019t have known.\n\nOP\u2019s parents tried to conceive for \u201cyears\u201d?  They are two years apart.  At most they tried for a year.  It\u2019s not recommended to ttc until at least 12 months post-partum.  Sure they could have ignored that, but mom definitely wasn\u2019t ttc until at least two months pp because her vagina had been ripped apart.  Then pregnancy is 9 months\u2026\n\nAll kids perceive their sibling is the favorite. Just none of this sounds real.  OP both thinks they\u2019re the \u201cgolden child\u201d and that the parents are overcompensating with the sister because they like OP best?  Then mom and sister cried and OP had a tantrum like a ten year old?  Nah", "Exactly. They triangulated them against each other.", "OP you are not at fault for your parents behaviour. They neglected your sister at your birth and for a few years and abused you ever since. They are 100% to blame and are shitty parents. I would send out a group text explaining this clearly to every relative and then go LC or NC with anyone supportive of the ongoing abuse.", "Oh honey, stop spending all holidays with them, especially Christmas/your birthday. Please. \n\nThere's a spoiled golden child here, and it isn't you. This is a toxic environment you have spent far too long in, and it's time to withdraw.\n\nI also was not a golden child -- my sister had a miracle birth & was the wanted, magical, God-given delight and I was the unwanted accident. She had a similar story to yours, but my parents never switched horses mid-race. The most healing thing I\"ve done is start my own healthier family, with no golden child in it.", "Your entirely family, ESPECIALLY your sister sound unbearable. And I disagree with the other comments saying it's not your sister's fault: it is. She is now a grown ass adult and a mother of four; she should have at least a modicum of self-awareness and emotional capacity to be able to think of the relationship she has with you and compare it to how her kids might feel, then correct based off of that. \n\nBut playing the victim after being coddled her whole life is never cute, but especially not cute at 34 with 4 kids. \n\nCut your family off. I have never met a person who has come to regret the decision when their family is this level of toxic, selfish, and holier-than-though. \n\nI'm so sorry you're dealing with all this. It isn't right and it isn't far, but it a failure on all of them, NOT you.", "Your mom is awesome", "That sounds cute", "Don't listen to the prick you're responding to.\n\nYour parents sucked as parents. And your sister is a p.o.s for digging up old wounds.\n\nGo NC with all of them until they apologize. Make it clear to them that if they don't, they won't even be allowed at your funeral one day.", "You should solve cold cases!", "Rainbow babies don\u2019t count if they have an older sibling. They aren\u2019t that special. Miscarriages happen all the damn time. It\u2019s when you\u2019ve had multiple miscarriages and then are somehow able to have one child.", "Yes we do, Debbie Downer.\n\n/s", "Any baby born after a miscarriage is a rainbow baby"]}
