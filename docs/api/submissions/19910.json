I was also born on Christmas Day, and for the first full year of my life I had medical problems. I spent my first weeks in an incubator and, several months later was re-hospitalized for weeks because of an infection and a severe allergic reaction to antibiotics.All of this was really hard on my sister (34f). She struggled during those years to get the attention she needed and my parents/ family doted on me because I was everyone's \"miracle baby.\" She developed some serious behavioral issues because of it, which my parents tried to address.\n\nHowever. To me, the course correction was extreme. We stopped celebrating my birthday altogether when I was around 9 or 10, because it was \"too hard\" for my sister to share Christmas with my birthday. From elementary school through high school, my parents never attended soccer games or school plays. They even missed my high school award ceremony where I won 2 awards. The reasons were usually things like \"Your sister has a therapy appointment\" or \"your sister isn't feeling well.\" When I graduated high school, everyone went out to my sister's favorite restaurant (that I didn't like) to celebrate that my sister was home for the occasion.\n\nParing down for word count, but one more example: when my sis graduated college, my whole family had a blowout party and my wealthy cousins paid off her student loans as a graduation gift. When I graduated, no one even attended the ceremony except my mom and dad, even though I graduated with dual majors, a 4.0, and 4 academic awards.\n\nRecently, I was at a family gathering, and the conversation came around to children. My sister has 4 kids, whereas I'm childfree. My BIL made a comment about how hard it is for the older siblings to adjust to the new kids, and my sister got really teary-eyed and emotional. She talked about how \"traumatic\" it was for her that I was born on Christmas and she had to miss that \"milestone\" with her parents and spend it with her aunt instead, and how hard it was to be the \"forgotten child\" and to have a sibling that was obviously the \"favorite\" and the \"Golden Child.\"My mom also got teary-eyed and apologized, saying she was so sorry for how hard it was for her, etc. Then my sister looked at me with this angry, disgusted look, and said something like \"and never expect the Golden Child to apologize for it.\" \n\nI honestly f\\*cking lost it.

It appears that they do not settle in a happy medium but are constantly trying to \u201cover correct\u201d to an extreme.  There is not a single reason to not celebrate your birthday\u2014even a day or two later or earlier if they want to preserve Christmas.  There is not a single reason that one couldn\u2019t attend your important events while the other went to your sister\u2019s.

There isn\u2019t a single reason that they couldn\u2019t divide stuff up to make it more even\u2014i.e. come to see you for Christmas and her for New Year\u2019s\u2014or to make separate times special.\n\nYour parents are triangulating.  They are ***DELIBERATELY*** setting up the situation so that you and sis ***CANNOT*** form a bond.  First one kid is the favorite.  Then the second kid, while making sure the first know that they aren\u2019t the favorite.  Then reverse so that second kid can\u2019t get a break and fawn all over the first one.  Reverse.  Rinse and repeat.  I\u2019m going to bet that when the \u201cgrandkids\u201d are no longer interested in knowing them, suddenly they will remember you and how you needed them.  So they will come running to you, all apologize and \u201cwe realize we weren\u2019t there for you\u201d and then you will be expected to just open your arms and let them into your life.

I will equally predict that if you suddenly had grandchildren, there would be a sudden reversal there as well.\n\nYou will notice that they have already brought in flying monkeys who will not offer a differing opinion.  That your whole family went along with whatever they wanted.  That no one tried to offer you a Christmas cake or came by with a birthday cupcake.  That NO ONE came by when you had a 4.0 (congrats) and awards.  Why wasn\u2019t there an aunt or cousin or grandparent there?

They also missed 2 college award ceremonies. And my sister got to go abroad twice in high school for school trips, but I was told we couldn't afford it. \n\nI did not have birthday parties at all beyond childhood. There were 2 attempts to have a party for me in the summer, but that stopped by age 11-12. In fact, between ages 17-22 I went through a phase where I would buy myself a cake at Christmas and passive-aggressively eat it by myself and everyone would just act like it wasn't happening. Once after my niece was born my dad tried to go get a birthday cake on Christmas for me and my sister had a meltdown and insisted he didn't so that we didn't \"spoil\" Christmas for my niece by \"making it about me.\"", "Also, I may not have made it clear in the post - it's not about a \"missed graduation\" 20 years ago. This is still the relationship that I have with my family. After my parents retired, they moved across the country to live closer to my sister, so I only see the family once or twice a year. When I call them, they just talk at me for an hour about everything new with my sister, and barely even ask me about my life. They've never met my partner even though we've been together for 5 years and live together. And I'm really career-focused and have a great job, but the last time I went to visit my mom, she literally forgot what my job was and said something like \"it's hard to keep up with current events,\" even though I've been in that field for almost a decade.

The problem now is that your parents and sister are carrying that trauma with them in their everyday life as it happened to them - your sister is still hurting as a 2yo (or whatever tf cause I call BS on this) who felt neglected while your parents cared for you.

They were devastated and tried fertility treatments for 15 years. Finally, around \\~40, my dad had surgery and they were able to have my sister. They were told not to have any more kids, but they wanted to try again because they'd always wanted a big family. They had a bad miscarriage and my mom almost died, but despite that they tried once more time and had me. I was premature and almost didn't make it, and it was a difficult pregnancy for my mom, so it was \"miraculous\" that I was born.

It doesn't matter (for the sake of being a rainbow baby or not) how much trouble the parents had conceiving the sister nor for how many years. If they didn't have a miscarriage before giving birth to sister. Than sister is NOT a rainbow baby. (Btw a simple Google search of rainbow baby could have told you this as well, but there you go). Anyway NTA OP", "I think there are some mischaracterizations here, unintentional ones.\n\nI don't think you were ever the rainbow baby, though every baby is a miracle. Your sister was the one they had after 15 years of struggling with infertility. She is the rainbow baby, which I think would predispose her to be the \"golden child\" in the family, not you. She's just calling you that because you are both dealing with trauma over not having enough parental attention and fighting to get it.\n\nAnd as for who is the \"golden child\" I think to me it sounds less like there was a Golden Child and more like when you were young, you had a lot of serious medical issues. That wasn't your fault. But a consequence of this was that your parents had to divert attention from your sister to care for you. As a result, this caused trauma to your sister and mental health issues--which manifested when she was older. \n\nSo fast forward a few years later when YOU were physically healthy and your parents were probably like phew, we can get our lives back on track, it was like not so fast, because your sister now had mental health issues due to their neglect (not their fault, but it is what it is.) So they had to do a huge course correct and suddenly just like they were devoting all their attention to you when you were sick when you were young, they were devoting all their attention to her at that phase in her life, trying to fix her issues. But of course, that then turned around and caused trauma and mental health problems for you as an adult.\n\nI don't know what to tell you as for a solution. I would think the question of whether a solution is possible really lies with whether your mom and sister are interested in changing their behavior. Do they care that it hurts you that mom has never met your partner in 5 years? Have you told your mom not to drone on about your sister for an hour and to ask about your life sometimes and she still talks about your sister? If she truly doesn't care, then painful as it is, I might go low/no contact. If they are interested in doing better, I would try to clearly explain what you need from them in the present (I would love for you to meet partner) without dragging the past into it.)", "I'm not trying to argue that your birth was wonderful and they were lucky to have another child at their ages and after a miscarriage... but I think you should rethink the term rainbow baby for two reasons... it usually refers to a baby that has been conceived after a hard struggle with infertility... and this baby is often turned into the golden child--which your sister has been as the adult.

So even IF that was a factor, sis still had preferential treatment during the most of those years, and OP's ability to have Anything special utterly eliminated shortly after. It has still been a Very long time since, where she's so triggered her own child might have Xmas ruined by a simple birthday cake, that I still agree she's using whatever leverage she can find to keep OP down and ignored. If anything, the science of development proves more strongly that she's making mountains out of molehills. Even if a couple formative years were an issue, the bulk of them were not.", "Most parents who have favorites won\u2019t admit it. My mother for example. She always claimed to love us the same but she didn\u2019t. We were fighting over a toy. We both knew better but I was the only one in trouble. I bought candy with my allowance. My sister didn\u2019t have any. My parents knew I had it because they had just given it to me. My sister stole her candy. It was discovered right away. They took mine back into the store as well and gave it back along with hers. The lady told them mine was paid for. It didn\u2019t matter and I couldn\u2019t have my money back either. We got Hostess pies once every two weeks. Once my sister ate both hers and mine. I got in trouble for not eating it right away. So I started inhaling all of my treats, I got into trouble for that, but I didn\u2019t stop doing it. Most unfavored children have similar types of stories I am sure.", "I must be related to your sister in the memory department. I remember a great deal of being 3 and a few of being 2(not many though).", "And my dumbass thought Rainbow baby is a lgbtq baby.", "\ud83d\ude04\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Apparently this term has been used for more than 46 years so it\u2019s not really in the new generations set of words for stuff.", "Just because miscarriages happen all the time doesn\u2019t mean people are allowed to grieve. People die everyday. Would you really downplay someone\u2019s parents dying because people die all the time?", "I only had one miscarriage but like you I didn\u2019t treat one any different. I never even knew of the term until Reddit so almost 45 years old. And you\u2019re right about the term because while I was crushed, I didn\u2019t have any difficulty dealing with it. Technically my second child shouldn\u2019t have been when she was born because I didn\u2019t intend to get pregnant at that time because I had just suffered the miscarriage. I didn\u2019t know an egg would be released that soon. That\u2019s one thing the doctors never tell you."]}
