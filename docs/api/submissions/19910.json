I was also born on Christmas Day, and for the first full year of my life I had medical problems. I spent my first weeks in an incubator and, several months later was re-hospitalized for weeks because of an infection and a severe allergic reaction to antibiotics.All of this was really hard on my sister (34f). She struggled during those years to get the attention she needed and my parents/ family doted on me because I was everyone's \"miracle baby.\" She developed some serious behavioral issues because of it, which my parents tried to address.\n\nHowever. To me, the course correction was extreme. We stopped celebrating my birthday altogether when I was around 9 or 10, because it was \"too hard\" for my sister to share Christmas with my birthday. From elementary school through high school, my parents never attended soccer games or school plays. They even missed my high school award ceremony where I won 2 awards. The reasons were usually things like \"Your sister has a therapy appointment\" or \"your sister isn't feeling well.\" When I graduated high school, everyone went out to my sister's favorite restaurant (that I didn't like) to celebrate that my sister was home for the occasion.\n\nParing down for word count, but one more example: when my sis graduated college, my whole family had a blowout party and my wealthy cousins paid off her student loans as a graduation gift. When I graduated, no one even attended the ceremony except my mom and dad, even though I graduated with dual majors, a 4.0, and 4 academic awards.\n\nRecently, I was at a family gathering, and the conversation came around to children. My sister has 4 kids, whereas I'm childfree. My BIL made a comment about how hard it is for the older siblings to adjust to the new kids, and my sister got really teary-eyed and emotional. She talked about how \"traumatic\" it was for her that I was born on Christmas and she had to miss that \"milestone\" with her parents and spend it with her aunt instead, and how hard it was to be the \"forgotten child\" and to have a sibling that was obviously the \"favorite\" and the \"Golden Child.\"My mom also got teary-eyed and apologized, saying she was so sorry for how hard it was for her, etc. Then my sister looked at me with this angry, disgusted look, and said something like \"and never expect the Golden Child to apologize for it.\" \n\nI honestly f\\*cking lost it. I said (yelled) that my entire family has basically ignored my existence for my entire life and that I hated every single person in the room.Since my outburst, literally no one is on my side, and my parents think I'm being insensitive to what my sister went through.

It appears that they do not settle in a happy medium but are constantly trying to \u201cover correct\u201d to an extreme.  There is not a single reason to not celebrate your birthday\u2014even a day or two later or earlier if they want to preserve Christmas.  There is not a single reason that one couldn\u2019t attend your important events while the other went to your sister\u2019s.

There isn\u2019t a single reason that they couldn\u2019t divide stuff up to make it more even\u2014i.e. come to see you for Christmas and her for New Year\u2019s\u2014or to make separate times special.\n\nYour parents are triangulating.  They are ***DELIBERATELY*** setting up the situation so that you and sis ***CANNOT*** form a bond.  First one kid is the favorite.  Then the second kid, while making sure the first know that they aren\u2019t the favorite.  Then reverse so that second kid can\u2019t get a break and fawn all over the first one.  Reverse.  Rinse and repeat.  I\u2019m going to bet that when the \u201cgrandkids\u201d are no longer interested in knowing them, suddenly they will remember you and how you needed them.  So they will come running to you, all apologize and \u201cwe realize we weren\u2019t there for you\u201d and then you will be expected to just open your arms and let them into your life.  If sis decides to go against them\u2014i.e. don\u2019t pay for something for them, don\u2019t let them move in, not let them into holiday plans\u2014it will trigger them to come to you.  I will equally predict that if you suddenly had grandchildren, there would be a sudden reversal there as well.\n\nYou will notice that they have already brought in flying monkeys who will not offer a differing opinion.  That your whole family went along with whatever they wanted.  That no one tried to offer you a Christmas cake or came by with a birthday cupcake.  That NO ONE came by when you had a 4.0 (congrats) and awards.  Why wasn\u2019t there an aunt or cousin or grandparent there?

They also missed 2 college award ceremonies. And my sister got to go abroad twice in high school for school trips, but I was told we couldn't afford it. \n\nI did not have birthday parties at all beyond childhood. There were 2 attempts to have a party for me in the summer, but that stopped by age 11-12. In fact, between ages 17-22 I went through a phase where I would buy myself a cake at Christmas and passive-aggressively eat it by myself and everyone would just act like it wasn't happening. Once after my niece was born my dad tried to go get a birthday cake on Christmas for me and my sister had a meltdown and insisted he didn't so that we didn't \"spoil\" Christmas for my niece by \"making it about me.\"", "Also, I may not have made it clear in the post - it's not about a \"missed graduation\" 20 years ago. This is still the relationship that I have with my family. After my parents retired, they moved across the country to live closer to my sister, so I only see the family once or twice a year. When I call them, they just talk at me for an hour about everything new with my sister, and barely even ask me about my life. They've never met my partner even though we've been together for 5 years and live together. And I'm really career-focused and have a great job, but the last time I went to visit my mom, she literally forgot what my job was and said something like \"it's hard to keep up with current events,\" even though I've been in that field for almost a decade.

The problem now is that your parents and sister are carrying that trauma with them in their everyday life as it happened to them - your sister is still hurting as a 2yo (or whatever tf cause I call BS on this) who felt neglected while your parents cared for you.

They were devastated and tried fertility treatments for 15 years. Finally, around \\~40, my dad had surgery and they were able to have my sister. They were told not to have any more kids, but they wanted to try again because they'd always wanted a big family. They had a bad miscarriage and my mom almost died, but despite that they tried once more time and had me. I was premature and almost didn't make it, and it was a difficult pregnancy for my mom, so it was \"miraculous\" that I was born.

It doesn't matter (for the sake of being a rainbow baby or not) how much trouble the parents had conceiving the sister nor for how many years. If they didn't have a miscarriage before giving birth to sister. Than sister is NOT a rainbow baby. (Btw a simple Google search of rainbow baby could have told you this as well, but there you go). Anyway NTA OP", "I think there are some mischaracterizations here, unintentional ones.\n\nI don't think you were ever the rainbow baby, though every baby is a miracle. Your sister was the one they had after 15 years of struggling with infertility. She is the rainbow baby, which I think would predispose her to be the \"golden child\" in the family, not you. She's just calling you that because you are both dealing with trauma over not having enough parental attention and fighting to get it.\n\nAnd as for who is the \"golden child\" I think to me it sounds less like there was a Golden Child and more like when you were young, you had a lot of serious medical issues. That wasn't your fault. But a consequence of this was that your parents had to divert attention from your sister to care for you. As a result, this caused trauma to your sister and mental health issues--which manifested when she was older. \n\nSo fast forward a few years later when YOU were physically healthy and your parents were probably like phew, we can get our lives back on track, it was like not so fast, because your sister now had mental health issues due to their neglect (not their fault, but it is what it is.) So they had to do a huge course correct and suddenly just like they were devoting all their attention to you when you were sick when you were young, they were devoting all their attention to her at that phase in her life, trying to fix her issues. But of course, that then turned around and caused trauma and mental health problems for you as an adult.\n\nI don't know what to tell you as for a solution. I would think the question of whether a solution is possible really lies with whether your mom and sister are interested in changing their behavior. Do they care that it hurts you that mom has never met your partner in 5 years? Have you told your mom not to drone on about your sister for an hour and to ask about your life sometimes and she still talks about your sister? If she truly doesn't care, then painful as it is, I might go low/no contact. If they are interested in doing better, I would try to clearly explain what you need from them in the present (I would love for you to meet partner) without dragging the past into it.)", "I'm not trying to argue that your birth was wonderful and they were lucky to have another child at their ages and after a miscarriage... but I think you should rethink the term rainbow baby for two reasons... it usually refers to a baby that has been conceived after a hard struggle with infertility... and this baby is often turned into the golden child--which your sister has been as the adult.

Your parents did a shit job of helping her adapt in a healthy way to your traumatic birth and really your existence in general.\n\nOp, just in case nobody has ever told you I want you to know you are absolutely amazing! I would be so incredibly proud if one of my daughters turns out like you. I don't know if you've had the opportunity to do any counseling regarding your family's blatant disregard for your emotional well-being but please don't let their behavior stop you from having an amazing life that you so richly deserve. \n\nI hope that you make a family that loves you and supports you and honor you for the amazing person you are. And when I say family I just mean people who are there for you no matter what. It doesn't have to be a spouse or children. I have some amazing friends that are my family to me then certain blood relatives have ever been or will ever be. You deserve all the good things that this life has to offer. Good luck!", "NTA.

Not remotely your fault; there\u2019s nothing for you to apologize for.", "My mom used to tell this story about my childhood that I always just accepted, I'd heard it my whole life. But when I was about 13, my mom told it again to some set of new friends and this one lady asked this question:\n\n\"Wait, am I understanding you right? You are asking us to praise you for being a great mom because you got out of bed when you had a cold to take your child to the hospital? Your child with <checks notes> an arterial cut that was spurting blood? That makes you a great mom? What was the alternative? Let her bleed out in front of you? You literally did the least amount of effort possible, woman?\"  and everyone, including me, all had this \"oh yeah, hey wait a minute!\" look on our faces. Because she told it well and she caught you up, etc.\n\nI feel like the you need something like that with your sister and mom/dad. \"Hey wait. Do I understand you correctly to be saying that you were devastated as a <checks notes> two year old that your sister was born on Christmas? How did you even know what Christmas was? Per your own story, by the time YOU were five, you got the attention to \"make up for\" ... So for the last 27 years you got all the attention to make up for the first three years of your sister's life, who had a medical condition she in no way was responsible for and you <checks notes again> want to her *apologize* for ... being born with a medical condition?

Good luck.\n\nTry and get some therapy, it might be time to go low contact until you get your abandonment issues untangled.", "WTF is this toxic mess I just read. NTA. If it were me I would stop going to family events and just not deal with them any more. What is the point.

Who needs that in their life?", "NTA\n\nPersonally, I'd cut them all off. They sound toxic AF, especially your sister.

You were a child that needed serious medical help, and that wasn't your fault. As a result, your parents felt guilty over not giving her attention to the point of ignoring you. That is not ok. Your sister seems to take any attention  on you as an attack on her. Honestly, the differences in the graduations alone is glaring. Your sister seems to have gotten a lot of support you haven't.\n\n\nHonestly, at this point, your family will not admit this is happening because it means they would have to admit they messed up and are messing up. Focus on your family of choice- people you chose to have in your life. Maybe avoid large gatherings whenever possible in your family, especially when your sister is present. She seems to want to turn it it a you vs her situation \n\nAlso, most people will argue it absolutely sucks to be born on Xmas because you never really get a bday, so your sister is delusional. Make sure to make your excuses whenever your sister has birthday plans and avoid", "NTA, your whole family sucks.", "NTA . You were never the golden child, you were a baby that had a lot of needs.

Your sister was two when you were born and it was \u201ctraumatic\u201d for your sister to spend that day with your aunt\u2026when she was too young to form memories? How does she have 4 kids and not realize how much BS this is? No two year old understands Christmas. You could do Christmas in July and the kid wouldn\u2019t know the difference. \n\nShe\u2019s used that as an excuse and your parents have let her. Most people don\u2019t like having their birthday on or near a holiday because there\u2019s usually not a separate celebration or kids get short changed on gifts. You\u2019ve been made to feel guilty about being born in a holiday. Please get some therapy for yourself.

Your sister was TWO when you were born and she had to miss one Christmas with your parents that I guarantee you she doesn't even remember.  And if you had health problems for a year, then she was still only three by the time you didn't require extra attention, which is still too young to really remember and be traumatized.  I was 5 and my middle sister was 3 when our youngest sister was born and had similar medical issues for roughly a year, and we BARELY remember it.\n\nYour sister is not traumatized.  She's jealous, and she's extremely manipulative.  She picked up on the fact that your parents felt guilty and realized that she if she cried \"trauma\" any time it was your turn in the spotlight, she could get them to turn that spotlight off.  Your sister definitely needs therapy, but it sure as hell isn't for trauma.", "NTA\n\nI mean it sounds like... you WEREN'T the golden child.

You should remember that your sister is a product of this abuse as well, and it sounds like they have been pitting you against each other since birth.

That makes much more sense- by the way your sister is acting I thought she was much older than you and had her teen years eclipsed by your health issues but her being bitter about something I bet she barely remembers seems sooo weird to me. Like, how could it have been that traumatic for you (sister)? Dang does she know how to milk a situation- NTA at all she needs to grow tf up. And as someone who had a sibling with a developmental disability, they got all of the attention, all of the resources, and I was left behind and became an overachiever to try and win my parents love and attention. So, I know how that goes but at the end of the day, my sibling didn\u2019t choose that life, they aren\u2019t responsible for my parents shortfalls, and frankly, my parents are human and one has acknowledged that they should have done a better job handling their time and attention. I keep boundaries with my other parent, because I just don\u2019t enjoy the martyr act and find it hurtful.

We don't consider our first any more or less special than our second and haven't given them any special moniker.", "A lot of the time, people don't even know when they've miscarried. The only reason I knew was that I'd been trying to conceive and therefore tested early; if I hadn't tested a week previously, it would have simply felt like a heavy, slightly late period. As it was, yes, it made me sad, but I dealt with it, knowing that I was always rolling the dice with a one in three or four chance of an early miscarriage, like everyone else. When my next child was born, he wasn't given any special moniker either. They're both just my kids. \n\nI haven't forgotten the existence of the miscarriage, but I don't think about it much anymore, either. If I had successfully carried that baby (which would've been impossible, since its genes were scrambled anyhow, but let's stipulate for a moment) I wouldn't have the son I actually raised, as those pregnancies would've overlapped. And I would ten thousand times rather have the living, specific, marvelous son I've loved and known as an individual for seventeen years now, than a hypothetical baby I never got the chance to meet.", "I am sorry to hear about your MC and glad to hear you went on to have a successful pregnancy. 2 of our 3 required clinical intervention and were very much planned and wanted. With one we had started setting up the nursery. Taking stuff down was as unpleasant as you would imagine.\n\nI do tend to be annoyed at the whole \u201crainbow baby\u201d thing more than I should, but the term wouldn\u2019t exist if people (but specifically women) talked about it.\n\nHaving a miscarriage does not make a woman any less of a woman (I have heard that said and I, man, shut that shit down real quick). That stigma continues to exist and until it goes the conversations will not happen. I suspect it has a lot to do with older and cultural mindsets continuing to carry on.\n\nReally, when you think about it, it\u2019s amazing life manages to continue beyond simple multi-celled organisms anyway. So, so many things need to line up, from biology to nutrition to cells dividing correctly to wombs being arranged correctly (that was a new one to me when we were getting evaluated) to, well, everything.\n\nLastly, and I always get shit for this, the concept that a miscarriage is any less painful for a man than the carrying woman needs to go. Some of us get really, really attached."]}
