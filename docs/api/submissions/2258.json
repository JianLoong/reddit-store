They are not your family.", "NTA\n\nThe ppl that should know you better than anyone in the world believed a stranger over you. And not only did they believe them, they actively made life harder for you. They deserve literally nothing.", "Play nice, as for your college fund plus interest and fees in cash as the entry fee to start playing the game to earn their way back. Make them get I am sorry tattoos, make them post on all social media what they did, make them write a god damn letter to the editor in your local paper that says what they did. Make them add you as an irrevocable person in their will. Have them plan a welcome home dinner at the most expensive place close to them, show up only to say fuck you to their fucking face, flip a table on your way out.", "YTA. They did a terrible, really truly terrible thing to you. So now you are doing something similar to them. They hurt you, so you are going to hurt them back. This is a normal, human reaction. But this makes you the same as them. They were acting based on false information. You are acting on revenge. \n\nI know it feels like the most difficult thing in the world to do. I know that it feels like you are betraying that younger version of yourself that had to walk through the cold in the middle of the night. I also know that if you are able to do this, then all of the hurt, anger and grief will melt away. Forgiving those who have truly harmed us helps us much more than it helps them. Holding onto past hurts is like drinking poison and hoping it will kill the other person.  It never, ever ends in a happy result. Think about it, pray about it. I strongly advise you to go see a professional counselor or therapist about this and get their perspective. It will be the best money you ever spent. Peace be with you.", "Your parents treated you horribly and even went as far as threatening to kill you. All over a lie. They let your grandmother die thinking you hadn't bothered to respond to her. Their actiong are monstrous even if they believed you had done what you were accused of. I wouldn't want to bother with them either. Your mother should be crying. NTA.", "Nah. They don\u2019t deserve anything from OP. Dead silence. They don\u2019t deserve a god damn thing", "This is the best answer! They need to know exactly how their actions affected you and actually PROVE to you that they feel remorse and want to make it up to you.", "NTA for sure. Even if the accusation was true, you don't just throw someone out in the snow and you don't lie to dying people that they don't want to see them.", "Grandma died though...", "The condition should be that they arrange a visit for him with grandma. Oh, it\u2019s not possible? Well, then neither is reconciliation.", "The ex doesn\u2019t care. I\u2019d be surprised that she even expected it to go this far. But seriously? As shitty as what she did, his family is 1000% responsible for their actions. She told a lie, yes, but they were cruel enough to deny him his grandma.", "NTA", "Don't do this. But if you do this, videotape it and post it on r/publicfreakout", "Where does it says that OP throwed them naked on the snow? I missed that part.", "NTA at all! Loyalty? Your brother wasn\u2019t loyal to his girlfriend and that\u2019s what started this whole thing!", "Just tell them you are upholding thecfamily tradition of loyalty. They showed none so you're following their lead", "In my family we get shunned for stupid stuff lol.\n\nI would completely understand everyone being upset and angry with the detail the ex knew about you, but they showed no loyalty to you at all.", "But didn\u2019t they do something against you?", "NTA. They threatened to send you for a long sleep. Their lack of loyalty deserves a restraining order. They may get the message then. Or, use the same lawyer who let you know about your grandmother\u2019s passing. Have them deliver a cease and desist order. Love and cherish the family you have created. Good luck to you and your family.", "So, you\u2019re upholding the family tradition. They did something against you, a member of the family, and the consequence is permanent shunning.", "It\u2019s a sign of your compassion that your mother\u2019s cry touched your heart. How sad that your cries never touched hers.\n\nKeep those vile people away from the family and life that you built. They are abusive and evil.", "Exactly, they never bothered to tell op. They\u2019ll think he thinks she\u2019s still alive. It has a double edge that can\u2019t contact grandma, she\u2019s gone", "That is my point. This will also have the added benefit of doubling down on the guilt trip his parents are currently on. They will remember that they lied to grandma about him and that he did not get to see her before she died.", "Exactly", "Be that as it is, they still chose to believe some bitter ex girlfriend of your brothers over you, their son.  What if your brother hadn't run into her - you would still be frozen out right?  They made their choice, now you are making yours.  Do what is best for you and your kids, and trust your gut on this one.  You aren't doing anything wrong.", "I'm really sorry this happened to you. My brother fired me when I worked for him for something I didn't even do. He never bothered to ask me about it, just decided I'd harmed his business.\n\nETA: I messaged him about it a few years back and told him what really happened and he responded that I was a tortured person and he felt sorry for me. Haven't talked to him in many years.\n\nWhen someone shows you they don't have your back, there's a good chance they will do it again. I'm glad you found a new life and new family, OP.  I've had to do much the same.", "on this vain. they were not loyal to you. they took the word of an angry ex over you so the next time they call remind them.", "YES! This", "Excellent point.", "Honestly, congratulations.I hope you love your life amazingly, and just know that your family will spend the rest of their lives regretting what they did to you."]}
