The idea you mentioned in another comment of her trying to get a job at a place that pays better doing the same work, is certainly a good recommendation.  She has the experience and skills so a better establishment could mean more money and better self esteem.\n\nMaybe you could give her some encouragement, you may have already, but help her to see her value and make the effort to move on to a place with better benefits.  Beyond that, there is not much you can do.  Her trying to make you feel guilty for what you have accomplished is not going to do her any good, point that out to her.

From the way you described it, it definitely sounds like she's the A for potentially dismissing the hard work you put in to getting your job. But at the same time, it sounds like maybe you haven't considered other aspects that could have contributed to her current situation beyond her \"not working hard\"\n\nWhat someone considers lucky is often influenced by their own experiences. I'm not referring to you specifically and not making any assumptions, but from my perspective, I consider someone lucky if they don't have mental health issues that impact their daily life, or if they have family who can help during financial struggles. I know that those people still work hard to get where they want to be, but I consider them 'lucky' because they have advantages that I don't (or rather, they don't have disadvantages that I do, if that wording sounds better, lol)\n\nIf your ex-SIL has mental health issues, or works too much to be able to do schooling alongside work, or has tried to applied for better jobs but gets rejected over and over, I can see why she may consider you lucky based on her personal experiences. And I can see why someone considering you lucky for getting to where you are when you put in a lot of hard work to get there would bother you. \n\nOverall, unless more context is given that changes it, imma say ESH, because to me it sounds like both of you may be dismissing each others' experiences that led to your differing situations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was at a point in my life where I literally walked into businesses to see if they were hiring. I never gave up. And that\u2019s the difference. It\u2019s too easy to rely on welfare and unemployment so people don\u2019t even try to rise above.", "I agree with all of this except the idea that they have the unfettered right to complain to anybody they wish and even belittle them in the process. It was stupid for SIL to put herself in the line of fire and she found out.", "Look, I\u2019m not a fan of the words that were used either but if we\u2019re going to seriously pretend her staying, a waitress for a decade is the appropriate path to get out of poverty I\u2019m going to have to laugh at that because we both know that\u2019s never going to be true for that profession", "Enabler is more like it", "Pssst \u2026 the people going to parties while you were disassembling your mom\u2019s bread machine to find out how it knew when to stop kneading were born with different natural talents than yours.", "So interesting that you recognize people are born with different natural athletic talents but discount the talents required to be an engineer. \n\nIf you were a theater kid who sang and made costumes and just decided engineering paid better even though you never had any curiosity about how things work or innate analytical and mathematical abilities and never truly felt aIive unless you heard applause, but you worked really hard, how successful would you be as an engineer?\n\nAcknowledging that you\u2019re lucky your innate talents happen to be those more valued in high paying careers doesn\u2019t discount the hard work it takes to apply those talents to get those degrees and those jobs.", "Because this NEVER happens, right? You downvoters are SO predictable.", "This woman has a child dipshit.", "So you had the good **luck** to be physically capable of working a manual labour job, you had a car, experienced no meaningful accidents, illness or injury, weren't arrested as an indigent even though you were one, presumably had access to shower and laundry facilities... Wow, that's really a lot of good luck actually.", "You're really harping on the semantics, my friend. It's very clear from OP's post and replies what the ex meant, and the ex meant to denigrate OP.\n\nHave you never met whiny complainers? Are *you* a whiny complainer?", "Why not a whiny enabler of whiny enablers?", "Hard disagree.", "I recognize that there is a world of difference between having the genetic traits required to be a successful professional athlete and the SKILLsets (emphasis on the word \"skill\") required to be an engineer. If someone has two short parents and only grows to be 5'5\", no amount of practice and hard work is going to get them into the NBA. Doesn't matter if they're fast, they can shoot, they can dribble...they can be incredibly skilled (skills acquired through repetition, hard work and endless practice) but they can't and won't make it in the NBA. The skillsets required to be an engineer are skillsets. Yeah, there are people who are naturally good at math and physics...but I'd say a large portion of engineers (myself in particular) got good at math and physics by spending thousands of hours in the fucking library working thousands of math and physics problems. Malcom Gladwell famously says that, and I'm paraphrasing here that \"the key to achieving true expertise in any skill is simply a matter of practicing, albeit in the correct way, for at least 10000 hours.\" I'll grant that there are a select few people who have learning disabilities that make it incredibly difficult to get good enough at math and physics to be an engineer, but I'd also argue that those people are much fewer and farther between than your typical redditor would think. \n\nTo your point, if you're a theater kid who's passions lie with that sort of thing, cool, more power to you. But I stand by my assessment that through hard work and putting in the hours, said theater kid could become an engineer if they did the research and decided that they wanted to follow a financially lucrative career. They're probably not going to end up at JPL...but most engineering isn't rocket science, it's just an analytical way to apply math and science to solve problems (problems that can be as mundane as designing cardboard packaging for some sort of unimportant widget) and they could probably have a boring but comfortable career. \n\nWhat gets me so heated about this topic is the implication that engineering is just too hard for normal people and that all the stars have to line up (genetically \ngifted, nerd parents, special/expensive schooling, \"privilege\", ect)  in order for someone to be an engineer. I'm a normal fucking guy who went to mediocre (at best) K-12 public schools, went to the \"prestigious\" CSU Chico and worked my ASS off to become an engineer (including remedial math classes). And the same MFrs who bitch and moan about how \"lucky\" I was to land a well paying job out of college were the chuckleheads who I watched walk by the engineering building at 3am on their way back from partying while my friends and I bulled our way through problem sets every week. Go to any university library during a non-finals week period...it's going to be predominantly engineers and pre-med in there. The skillsets that you attribute to being genetically lucky have fuck all to do with genetics and everything to do with putting in THOUSANDS of hours of studying and work and it's degrading to boil all that down to just \"luck\".", "Literally they are though? Go to an in state college for engineering and get hired at a good company straight away, if you have the grades and the internships on your resume. Working hard will absolutely get you 100k at 24. Source: I did this, and many of my colleagues are new grads making 90-110k.", "To add to this, when did OP graduate?   I graduated college in the mid 2000s and ten years later when my youngest brother was looking to go to the same school the tuition was more than double the already outrageous $32k a year I paid.   \n\nThere\u2019s no way you can pay your way through college with prices like that working a night job.   Admittedly, there are a lot cheaper schools out there, but it\u2019s a significant amount of money even for state schools or lower tier private schools."]}
