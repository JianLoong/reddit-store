The idea you mentioned in another comment of her trying to get a job at a place that pays better doing the same work, is certainly a good recommendation.  She has the experience and skills so a better establishment could mean more money and better self esteem.\n\nMaybe you could give her some encouragement, you may have already, but help her to see her value and make the effort to move on to a place with better benefits.  Beyond that, there is not much you can do.  Her trying to make you feel guilty for what you have accomplished is not going to do her any good, point that out to her.

From the way you described it, it definitely sounds like she's the A for potentially dismissing the hard work you put in to getting your job. But at the same time, it sounds like maybe you haven't considered other aspects that could have contributed to her current situation beyond her \"not working hard\"\n\nWhat someone considers lucky is often influenced by their own experiences. I'm not referring to you specifically and not making any assumptions, but from my perspective, I consider someone lucky if they don't have mental health issues that impact their daily life, or if they have family who can help during financial struggles. I know that those people still work hard to get where they want to be, but I consider them 'lucky' because they have advantages that I don't (or rather, they don't have disadvantages that I do, if that wording sounds better, lol)\n\nIf your ex-SIL has mental health issues, or works too much to be able to do schooling alongside work, or has tried to applied for better jobs but gets rejected over and over, I can see why she may consider you lucky based on her personal experiences. And I can see why someone considering you lucky for getting to where you are when you put in a lot of hard work to get there would bother you. \n\nOverall, unless more context is given that changes it, imma say ESH, because to me it sounds like both of you may be dismissing each others' experiences that led to your differing situations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
