(She was tangled in some brush in a ditch next to his yard). A neighbor with a flyer - who happened to be passing by called me, and I went and picked up my puppy. I was so happy to be reunited with her! And grateful for the man who found her.\n\nI asked the man if I could come back with the reward, as I did not have it on me. The man said he wasn't worried about the reward, he was just happy and surprised to find her. And glad that she was safe.\n\nSeveral hours after picking up my puppy, the man's mother texted me and said they want the reward. I text her back and told her what her son had told me, when I picked up my pup.\n\nShe then texted me back and said her son has a brain injury and doesn't always know what he is saying. And that she would be in contact again, to get the reward money.\n\nEdit, to add: I feel like the man was being a good Samaritan and knew what he was saying he didn't want any reward money. I feel like the man's mother is seeing this as an easy way to score some money. \n\nI'm thinking I may be the AH if I ignore the woman, since I did post a reward, even though her adult son said he didn't want the money. I am conflicted as to whether or not to give the reward to her (the man's mother who contacted me), as she is not the one who found my pup.\n\nEdit: I feel it is important to add here that I have zero problem with delivering on my reward offer, but only to the man who did free my pup and return her to me. I just feel like the mom is being shady and wants the money for herself. So I refuse to give it to her.

No you can\u2019t take the puppy unless you bring me the money?  Come on. \n\nAlso, you can\u2019t tell just by looking at him if he has a brain injury. All the people saying \u201cwell he declined\u201d, would you be saying that if you knew for sure he hard a brain injury?  It was mentally challenged?  No. \n\nOp don\u2019t be a jerk. Go back and give the money to the man directly and insist he take it.", "You know, all of this depends on whether or not the son actually has a brain injury. If he does, it would suit you to reward him, whether or not he himself wants it, as he may not understand what it entails to take care of him. If he doesnt, then NTA. \n\nBut right now NAH", "YTA.\n\nFor all you know the mom could be telling the truth. I have no idea and really neither do you. I would probably send her the money strictly for the sake of appreciating her for bringing a child into the world who grew up and happened to help me with something significant (like finding a pet I love). \n\nThe fact you didint bring the reward with you and etc makes me think you were hoping that the guy would say no so as not to cause you the trouble. Which is pretty much what happened. \n\nIn the future when you promise a reward you make good on it. Don\u2019t be a liar. You show up cash or check or Venmo on hand and you pay the reward you promised because that\u2019s the right thing to do. And if the person refuses you insist.", "YTA.

However, the right thing to do is text her back, tell her you would be glad to give her son the reward, you want to thank him again, when is a good time to meet him?\n\nIf she gets squirrelly, just tell her you will give to son, she can be there, when is a good time?\n\nEdit, NTA in refusing to give the money to the MOTHER.

I would have had the reward money ready just in case.  Then you could have handed it to man and nothing that came after would have happened.\n\nHaving said that, since you didn't have it with you, why not just go back and give it to the man?  I don't get why this is such a difficult situation.\n\nAs for what the mother said, that is entirely possible.  I was staying with the husband of my cousin once while she did some shopping.  He was in an accident and was brain damaged and was much like a small child.  One of those people selling meat out of the back of his truck drove up and tried to sell him some.  I explained that he had no money and was not capable of making decisions and the meat seller STILL tried to sell him meat.  The man who found your dog might be in the same shape.\n\nI would take the reward back to them and if the man is there, give it to him.  If he's not, give it to the mother.  You made the offer and got your dog back.  The reward should be paid.", "NTA. I don't get a lot of the responses here, the person who helped you find your dog refused the reward. As far as I am concerned that is the end of the discussion. Sounds like the mother just wants free money to me.", "NTA she didn't find the puppy. That's it, anything else is irrelevant. He found d the puppy and denied the reward. She didn't find the puppy and therefore deserves nothing.", "NTA the only person who can claim the reward is the man who found your pup. \n\nHe probably doesn't have a brain injury and the mother just wants the money.", "NTA but my observation is you used a lot of words to tell us the man who found your pup didn\u2019t put forth a ton of effort. Not the point. \n\nIf you posted about a reward I would offer it to him again, with it in hand, and give him the option to accept or decline.\n\nI can see why his mom rubbed you the wrong way but don\u2019t let her effect what you do.", "You don't understand each other. It was the son's job to say no and your job to insist. If the son refuses three times then he really doesn't want the money. Go back with the reward and offer it to the son.

If I say no thanks, I mean what I said -- I'm not trying to do some kind of performative humility dance and it is insulting that there's no way to make that clear.\n\nThat guy did a good thing by finding your dog for you and then he doubled down by refusing the reward.  That should be the end of any such conversation.  Don't let some unrelated third party bother you any further about it.", "NTA\n\nWhat the mother said seems just like an excuse.

End of story.", "INFO - Are you sure that the ~~woman~~ person who texted you is really the finder's mom?\n\nBest solution would be to take the cash, return to the man who found the dog and offer it to him, if he declines it again, donate to local ASPCA or such.\n\nYWNBTA if you didn't give this woman anything.", "If you read what OP wrote, the man never actually declined the reward.

No need to give it to his mother.

But you don't have to do it", "NTA. The man, whether he actually has a brain injury or not 1) found the puppy himself, not his mom and 2) he did refuse the reward, after all. The mother basically isn\u2019t part of this situation other than being related to him.

You were rightly upset, but you simply didn't handle this right. Please go fix it.", "You should have gone back regardless. You had to rush away, fine but you left it so that he would have to call you, tell you who he was and that he was calling for his reward. Most people when left in that situation would be almost forced to say no out of politness. Dont give it to the mother, go back and insist and give it to him.", "Neither would i and i hope no one i know would ever expect reward money for finding a lost pet. I would definitely look at them much differently after that. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s offered, it\u2019s just one of those things that can showcase people\u2019s character.", "Neither would I, especially if the animal had to go to the vet because it was injuried. I'd tell the owner to use the reward money on the vet bill.", "Same here, I'd say donate to a rescue or something if they wanted to.\n\nBut OP should just go deliver the reward and be done with it.", "It's not being stingy. It's being cautious. Anyone could be contacting her since her number was passed all over on the flyers. The mom can also be going behind the sons back to do this as well. It's weird she's contacting op at all when the son should be doing it.", "Block her number.  He said no.  You are done.", "Depending where you are, if you text her and tell her to stop contacting you, by law she must. Otherwise it is harassment, and you can file a report with the police.", "Got it. But still, the right thing to do is pay the reward to that man. Do it, and make sure to send his mother a video of the delivery", "It isn't pestering.", "If my friend forgot their wallet and I needed to pay and they said they\u2019d pay me back and I said I wasn\u2019t worried about that  glad I could help you\u2019d assume I was treating and my intent was merely to say I wasn\u2019t concerned that they wouldn\u2019t pay me back.  It\u2019s not as clear as you think, at least not for me.  Yes I wouldn\u2019t take a reward unless of course it was Lady Gaga but that\u2019s not the point here.", "I work with people with brain injuries. It doesn\u2019t work like that. Some people are capable of doing almost everything by themselves but if you ask them to \u201cplease come with me I\u2019m going to need to take your spleen\u201d they would be \u201cok sure\u201d and come with you. Others are fine 99% of the time but then get really upset and hurl abuse over the smallest random thing. \n\nWhen I was little, there was a man in our village that all the kids knew that if you asked him for money he would give it to you. My parents told me very sternly that it was really wrong to ask him for money because he couldn\u2019t refuse and it was taking advantage. \n\nIt is entirely possible that this man lives with his mom, he might be quite capable physically but she looks out for him and she feels like he is owed this reward and that OP should not take advantage of his kindness.", "That's exactly what I was thinking lol...\n\nAlthough I do know a man who is special needs that exclusively mows lawns for a living, another man who has some cognitive limitations, but is exceptionally skilled when it comes to machinery.  Neither of those men have any sort of brain damage though.", "Or word got around that the puppy was found, and someone else is trying to score the reward.", "Yea I could understand if that person had to drive somewhere to meet or if they were late for work or something, but just finding a dog & calling the owner, nah.  He did what most people would do, no worries, I'm just glad the puppy's ok.", "Why would a totally random person call asking for this reward? That's not the simplest explanation here. You think the rescuer has been going around saying he saved a dog and rejected the reward... and now some rando that heard this is tracking you down?\n\nMakes no sense.", "Ahh yes, the first instance of someone lying for financial gain in all of recorded history. Truly unprecedented. \n\n\nUnrelated, I've got a bridge for sale. The price is so good you could *almost* call it a steal. I'm very trustworthy, all traveling bridge merchants are.", "Edit with example...\n\nIf I'm going out of town and need a dog sitter and a friend of mine asks if she can help with the dog, I would immediately say no. That is to protect both of us. It protects her against making promises she doesn't want to keep and protects me from imposing on someone. If she then says that she would really like to watch my fur baby I would say I can't ask that of you. If she asks me a third time and I do indeed need a dog sitter I might say yes. If I do need a dog sitter but don't want her to watch my dog I might say no thanks one again and that is the final answer.\n\nThat is probably how half of the country communicates. The other half communicate with directness. Would you like me to watch your dog? Absolutely... thanks.\n\nI am not putting judgment on either of these conversational styles and I'm just mentioning that between the two of them it was different. He expected to be asked two more times and she took his first answer as a direct denial.\n\nNo one is an asshole. She should offer him the reward again. His mother is not part of the conversation.", "If you show up at my door asking me a question I've already answered ....THAT would be HELLA ANYOING to me.", "That's apples to oranges... In that scenario your friend had the intention to pay and you covered for her, because you had no other option that didn't involve public humiliation.  Too, you wouldn't say that to your friend bc it would be confusing and likely lead them to believe you were treating them.  I would get how it could come off as a grey area, if all he said was don't worry about it, but that's not all he said.  When he told her that, it was in response to her asking if she could come back to give him the reward, then added he was just surprised and happy to find her, and glad she was ok.  OP then told him to contact her for the reward, which he didn't do.  So in your scenario, if you said no worries to your friend and they then said, well contact me when you want me to pay you back, & you never do, it would be clear you didn't expect them to.", "Ask if they will meet (both the man and the mom) in a public place to get the reward money. Chances are she could drop the request if she isn't really his mom.", "His mum will take every penny. Is there a way you can put it on a store card for something she's unlikely to use?", "Why are we assuming they are the same?", "I lived with my in laws, of a very different culture, and was cooking myself an egg, as a late breakfast. I was under the impression that everyone had eaten.  My BIL was talking to me in the kitchen, & when I put my egg on my plate, he passive aggressively said \"That's ok, I didn't want any...\".  I asked if he wanted me to make him one since the skillet was still hot, but he again responded in the same sarcastic tone that no, that's ok he didn't want an egg, and added that I was rude for not asking. I was confused, & asked why he didn't say anything earlier, & he said it's because he didn't want to be rude.  I said, by that logic, aren't you being rude now?  He said no because I should've asked.  How dare I not be a mind reader.", "You are right in that if the person who found the pet had to use a lot of gas or something similar and was very hard up for money, like many folks are these days unfortunately, that would definitely be an exception to the situation.", "It could be one of the bystanders on the sidewalk who heard the man refuse the reward and thought they could claim it for themselves. OP stated they will still happily give the reward to the man, and if this is really his mom he can then give it to her if he wants. If it's not, they won't be able to get their hands on the money that way.", "I might try to address what the \"mother\" is saying, in case she's not his mother or she's lying about the brain injury or whatever... he has a right to know this. \n\nBut saying it to him directly will be embarrassing for him if it's not true, and possibly confusing/hurtful if it is.\n\nMy solution would be to get a thank you card.\n\nI'd write something in the card along the lines of like\n\n>Thank you so much for finding and saving my dog. It means so much to me. I know you said you didn't want a reward, but I felt you deserved one anyway. Especially after your mother contacted me and shared about your own struggles! Wishing you all the best!\n\nPut the money in the card, seal it up, make sure you place it in his hands \"wanted to give you a thank you card!\" and then let him open/process it on his own.\n\nI do disagree with one point, I *don't* think you should have his \"mother\" there. If it's a woman related to/with power over him she might just take the reward and maybe even harm him. She sounds unhinged.\n\nI wouldn't go too much into detail. If he wants to know more, he obviously knows how to contact you.\n\nI would 100% block the mother. You don't owe her anything, legally or ethically, and she's harassing you. Not okay.", "Look at my example. And yes, being polite can be very annoying.", "Yeah. When my cat got out I put out a lost pet alert on Facebook neighborhood page and I started getting scam texts saying they found my cat but must click a link then sent me to \u201cverify\u201d I am the owner. I got several of them from different numbers all because the lost pet alert displayed my number.", "If I say no, no means no. There's no polite social dance, no interpretations necessary, not an invite to a relationship, or permission to be on my property. It's just no.   \n\n\nBeing polite is being considerate.  I would find it considerate to have to only answer a question ONE TIME. I would consider it IMPOLITE to be bothered more.", "I feel like something has been lost here. No one is an asshole. The puppy owner and the puppy finder have two different sets of rules governing their interaction. The puppy finder seems like a nice man and should probably get a reward. If the puppy owner doesn't give him a reward she is not going to end up in court. It's a goddamn reward for finding a puppy.", "She posted on Facebook as well as put up fliers. Obviously she put contact info on the fliers.", "That falls under the heading of maybe.  OP made flyers, so many people had access to the phone number.  Another neighbor actually produced the flyer with the phone #.  The man mowing his lawn gave op the dog, and declined the reward.  OP has no idea who this person texting is, & has only the messages to go off of, nor does OP know if they are any relation to the man, since the \"mother\" is insisting OP only communicate with & give money to her, then continues to harass OP.  Those points are fact.  As a parent of a child who was oxygen deprived, if it were my child, I would respect their decision to decline the reward, but if I felt like they shouldn't have, I would call that person and set up a meeting to collect with my child so that they could accept, & I would never make a claim that it was also my reward.  This person texted telling op she needed to give them \"their\" reward, indicating they were also involved in finding the dog, which they weren't.  That is false.  So you have a rando texting and falsely claiming they are somehow jointly entitled to the money.  That is the only factual evidence anyone knows about this person.", "Thank you. I would never accept a reward either. If anyone insisted I would tell them to contribute to their local humane society instead.", "Okay, so OP entered in to a \"unilateral contract\" that states that they will pay a reward to whomever found and returned their lost dog. \n\nThe person who found and returned the pup refused to accept the reward.\n\nSoooooo... case closed, OP is still in the right?", "We live in a pretty dark world if someone could get sued for \"breach of contract\" over a fucking missing dog poster.\n\nAssuming this is a \"contract\", the terms were that whomever finds and returns OPs dog will be rewarded.\n\nThe person who found and returned the dog refused to accept the reward. OP cannot force them to do anything, even accepting money.\n\nSo case closed, contract fulfilled.", "So you\u2019re saying OP is the AH for not giving the money to some woman claiming to be his mom?", "So you\u2019ve willingly turned everyone who accepted those lost dogs into assholes?\n\nAfter all, he said he wouldn\u2019t accept the reward. Just like you have. And she\u2019s listened to him, just like those you\u2019ve dealt with have. You seem to think this makes OP an asshole, so it follows to reason that you think everyone you\u2019ve returned dogs to are also assholes.", "How is anyone to know though?  The man gave no indication that he was cognitively disabled.  That was a claim made by a random person via text who has indicated that they are also entitled to the reward money, and is insisting that the money be given only to them, in spite of having nothing to do with the situation.   Their approach is that OP needs to give the \"mother\" *their* money, as in hers & her son's.  If this is true, she's taking advantage of her son & not respecting his wishes.", "That comment is in direct response to your \u201cyou make it sound like a contract\u201d comment. \n\nWhich it is. That is all.\n\nAnything else, you can argue about with someone else.", "Yea, a lot of people where I live don't even know what that is..."]}
