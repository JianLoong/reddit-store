(She was tangled in some brush in a ditch next to his yard). A neighbor with a flyer - who happened to be passing by called me, and I went and picked up my puppy. I was so happy to be reunited with her! And grateful for the man who found her.\n\nI asked the man if I could come back with the reward, as I did not have it on me. The man said he wasn't worried about the reward, he was just happy and surprised to find her. And glad that she was safe.\n\nSeveral hours after picking up my puppy, the man's mother texted me and said they want the reward. I text her back and told her what her son had told me, when I picked up my pup.\n\nShe then texted me back and said her son has a brain injury and doesn't always know what he is saying. And that she would be in contact again, to get the reward money.\n\nEdit, to add: I feel like the man was being a good Samaritan and knew what he was saying he didn't want any reward money. I feel like the man's mother is seeing this as an easy way to score some money. \n\nI'm thinking I may be the AH if I ignore the woman, since I did post a reward, even though her adult son said he didn't want the money. I am conflicted as to whether or not to give the reward to her (the man's mother who contacted me), as she is not the one who found my pup.\n\nEdit: I feel it is important to add here that I have zero problem with delivering on my reward offer, but only to the man who did free my pup and return her to me. I just feel like the mom is being shady and wants the money for herself. So I refuse to give it to her.

Give the reward money.\n\nETA to the man, not the mother.", "INFO: why didn't you bring the reward money with you when you went to pick up the dog?", "YTA It\u2019s called courtesy when sme does something nice and in this case finding your puppy the least you can do is giving a small token for your appreciation", "Yta. \n\nYou offered a reward, you should pay the reward. When you were called, instead of going over with the reward, you went empty handed. Were you hoping he would decline?  Seems odd you wouldn\u2019t bring it over. What is the guy supposed to say?  No you can\u2019t take the puppy unless you bring me the money?  Come on. \n\nAlso, you can\u2019t tell just by looking at him if he has a brain injury. All the people saying \u201cwell he declined\u201d, would you be saying that if you knew for sure he hard a brain injury?  It was mentally challenged?  No. \n\nOp don\u2019t be a jerk. Go back and give the money to the man directly and insist he take it.", "You know, all of this depends on whether or not the son actually has a brain injury. If he does, it would suit you to reward him, whether or not he himself wants it, as he may not understand what it entails to take care of him. If he doesnt, then NTA. \n\nBut right now NAH", "YTA.\n\nFor all you know the mom could be telling the truth. I have no idea and really neither do you. I would probably send her the money strictly for the sake of appreciating her for bringing a child into the world who grew up and happened to help me with something significant (like finding a pet I love). \n\nThe fact you didint bring the reward with you and etc makes me think you were hoping that the guy would say no so as not to cause you the trouble. Which is pretty much what happened. \n\nIn the future when you promise a reward you make good on it. Don\u2019t be a liar. You show up cash or check or Venmo on hand and you pay the reward you promised because that\u2019s the right thing to do. And if the person refuses you insist.", "YTA.

If he declines taking it, then at least you keep your word. I however, would not give it to his mom. She didn\u2019t do anything to deserve it. Glad you got your puppy back!!", "YTA.

Go talk to the man again and offer him the money again.", "Hmmm, is the woman claiming to be the mother, even the mother?  Sounds a little fishy.  However, the right thing to do is text her back, tell her you would be glad to give her son the reward, you want to thank him again, when is a good time to meet him?\n\nIf she gets squirrelly, just tell her you will give to son, she can be there, when is a good time?\n\nEdit, NTA in refusing to give the money to the MOTHER.

You\u2019re just being cheap and fooling yourself into thinking this has something to do with principles. \n\nIf his mother had called and said \u201cthey would like you to take the money back\u201d would you refuse?

I would have had the reward money ready just in case.  Then you could have handed it to man and nothing that came after would have happened.\n\nHaving said that, since you didn't have it with you, why not just go back and give it to the man?  I don't get why this is such a difficult situation.\n\nAs for what the mother said, that is entirely possible.  I was staying with the husband of my cousin once while she did some shopping.  He was in an accident and was brain damaged and was much like a small child.  One of those people selling meat out of the back of his truck drove up and tried to sell him some.  I explained that he had no money and was not capable of making decisions and the meat seller STILL tried to sell him meat.  The man who found your dog might be in the same shape.\n\nI would take the reward back to them and if the man is there, give it to him.  If he's not, give it to the mother.  You made the offer and got your dog back.  The reward should be paid.", "NTA. I don't get a lot of the responses here, the person who helped you find your dog refused the reward. As far as I am concerned that is the end of the discussion. Sounds like the mother just wants free money to me.", "NTA she didn't find the puppy. That's it, anything else is irrelevant. He found d the puppy and denied the reward. She didn't find the puppy and therefore deserves nothing.", "NTA the only person who can claim the reward is the man who found your pup. \n\nHe probably doesn't have a brain injury and the mother just wants the money.", "NTA but my observation is you used a lot of words to tell us the man who found your pup didn\u2019t put forth a ton of effort. Not the point. \n\nIf you posted about a reward I would offer it to him again, with it in hand, and give him the option to accept or decline.\n\nI can see why his mom rubbed you the wrong way but don\u2019t let her effect what you do.", "You don't understand each other. It was the son's job to say no and your job to insist. If the son refuses three times then he really doesn't want the money. Go back with the reward and offer it to the son.

That should be the end of any such conversation.  Don't let some unrelated third party bother you any further about it.", "NTA\n\nWhat the mother said seems just like an excuse. And tbh why would you need a reward for only finding a puppy in your yard. \n\nHas niceness left the room lately ?\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA\n\nYou offered the reward and he declined it. End of story.", "INFO - Are you sure that the ~~woman~~ person who texted you is really the finder's mom?\n\nBest solution would be to take the cash, return to the man who found the dog and offer it to him, if he declines it again, donate to local ASPCA or such.\n\nYWNBTA if you didn't give this woman anything.", "If you read what OP wrote, the man never actually declined the reward.

No need to give it to his mother. But if her story is true and he might didn't mean it, when he said, he doesn't want the money - than it would be nice, to ask again and might give him the money if he wants it. But you don't have to do it", "NTA. The man, whether he actually has a brain injury or not 1) found the puppy himself, not his mom and 2) he did refuse the reward, after all. The mother basically isn\u2019t part of this situation other than being related to him.

You don't owe her anything and the guy declined.\n\nYou could pop by on your next walk with doggo to say thanks again- are you sure you don't want the reward money my guy, I have it right here? The danger is that the mother answers the door and gives you an earful, so it's up to you if you give a fuck about if she does or not.", "YTA\nYou offered a reward.\nPAY THE REWARD", "NTA, the mother is probably making it up.

I'm curious about the amount . \n\nI doubt she would ask reddit what to do if Op had the money and the reward was small like $50 and I doubt the mom would pressure OP if the amount was small. so if it's $500 it may be diffrent.", "That's why I wonder how high the reward was or what exactly was written as a reward. I mean if it is $50 its a nice gesture to pay if she wrote $500 it may be a different story \n\nWhen you are desprarte of course you promise something .you want your dog back", "OP didn\u2019t want to pay this person to begin with. \n\n\nThat\u2019s why they didn\u2019t bring the reward and instead asked if man wanted them to bring it back. And then instead of insisting he take it, OP banked on him not wanting to be an inconvenience. \n\nHell one of OPs comments says \u201cnot every act of kindness needs a price tag\u201d. If that\u2019s not a red waving flag in the context of this post- idk what is. \n\nOp asked this person to jump through hoops to collect their reward. Let\u2019s be real, most people aren\u2019t willing to call some stranger and be like \u201cyeah can I have my money\u201d, and op isn\u2019t an idiot, so op knows that.  \n\nIf someone found a lost pet of mine they would have gotten the money no matter what. I wouldn\u2019t ask them if they want it. Of course they WANT it it\u2019s FREE money in this economy. You knew he wanted it OP, but socially it\u2019s uncomfortable to say \u201cyes\u201d in that scenario. Ffs.", "I\u2019m guessing OP would know if that was customary in their culture.", "And you don\u2019t know how rewards for lost pets work. \n\nWhen you post a reward you pay that reward at the time of collection. With cash or one of the other multiple easy ways to get someone money.", "Then why is she trying to find an excuse not to pay it now? \n\n\"I will only hand over the money if the brain damaged man calls and asks me directly, not his own mother who is clearly explaining the situation and her son's disability. That just means I'm keeping it.\"", "I WAS so excited at the THOUGHT of this being my missing pup! All I could think was to rush there to see if it was, but I had also prepared myself in case it wasn't. I had already received many false leads. It was disheartening to get my hopes up and be let down. \n\nI don't carry that much cash on me... Ever...  \n\nWhat some commenters are choosing to overlook is my post is talking about not being comfortable with giving the reward money to the woman claiming to be the man's mother. I have repeated over again that I do want to give the reward money to the man, but I cannot force him, if he doesn't want it. (I intend on going to see him today, as I don't have a way to contact him directly)... I don't know all about zenmo. I am an elderly woman", "Which was a shit thing for you to do. \n\nYou agreed on a reward and then you asked this person to jump through hoops to get it. \n\nNext time you either come cash in hand OR you immediately ask for a venmo or etc. Most people aren\u2019t going to feel comfortable chasing you down for the reward they are owed. And unless you\u2019re an asshole, you shouldn\u2019t be comfortable making someone have to chase you down.", "But you're trying to wiggle out of paying it now because a disabled man's mother called to explain the situation. I guess you figured you can take advantage of his disability to pocket the money you promised for yourself?", "According to OP, and only after she made a comment about not having the money. It was a common courtesy response, and didn\u2019t mean that this man didn\u2019t need the money also. She broke her word, and then makes the guy and his mother the bad guy.", "This is my plan. Thank you for your reply", "Why did you ask him instead of insisting though?\n\nForget that you didint have the money. The fact you even asked, instead of outright insisting is an AH move in itself. \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d have been asking for *his* number and where *he\u2019s* gonna be later in the day so I can please bring him his reward. \n\nYou created a social situation where most people would say no.", "No, of course not. Just go back with the reward and insist the puppy rescuer take it. If he continues to refuse just get him a gift card.", "That is just not true. I just did not have the cash when I picked up my pup. I asked him to contact me so we could make arrangements. I was rushing to get my injured lup to the Vet.", "I never said I didn't want to give the reward money to the man. Just something doesn't feel right about this woman, who says he is the man's mother, texting me nonstop throughout the night. Even after I told her I will deal directly with her son, to deliver the reward money, and not her. My first response to the woman's text was that I was so grateful to her son for finding and saving my pup, and I would get with her son today regarding the reward money (since it was late last night when she began texting me). But that didn't suffice. She text me all through the night, which made me uncomfortable to even respond to her anymore.", "I think that's why they want to deal directly with the man who found their dog, and give him the reward, rather than give it to the mother of the man.", "You do realise most people don\u2019t carry cash now a days right? Or if they do they might have \u00a320 on them, which I expect was significantly less than the reward.", "That's an inaccurate conclusion, if not also uncharitable. Perhaps OP wasn't home at the time of notification that the neighbour had found the dog? Perhaps it was cash amount large enough that they weren't carrying it around on them for the multiple days that the dog had now been missing? Call me a glass half full, but the issue isn't that OP didn't want to pay, but that the son declined an offer to receive the reward, and the mother is being greedy.", "Who said, not everyone carries money on their person 24/7. Either just say give or not", ">And you don\u2019t know how rewards for lost pets work.\n\nYou make it sound like a contract.", "Wtf?  Is there a step by step handbook on how to administer rewards for lost animals?  Are you supposed to carry the reward money around with you 24-7 in case someone calls to say they've found your pet?", "I haven't broken my word. I said I only want to deal with the man, not his mother. I don't want for her to use this for her own benefit. I want to reward only the man who found my pup and freed her from the brush. He's a hero and deserves the reward I promised. I feel people are judging, without taking this into consideration.", "Update us on how that goes lol", "In the comment you deleted you said \u201cnot every good deed requires price tag\u201d. \n\nTo me, that sounds like the words of someone who doesn\u2019t *actually* feel good about giving the reward. Makes it seem like you aren\u2019t being genuine in your post.", "I\u2019m not even talking about the mom. \n\nYour pet went missing. You offered a reward. Someone found your pet and let you know. You showed up to pick up your pet. You did not bring the reward money with you. If you were offering reward money, why didn\u2019t you have the reward money?", "If the man has a brain injury and cannot fully comprehend what\u2019s going on and mom is who looks after him, then moms going to be involved since OP has already shown themselves to be less than honest", "You do realize venmo is a thing, right?", "I'm thinking, what if it was a setup? Not bringing the money until confirming the dog was actually theirs, present and unharmed, was a fairly smart choice imo.", "I fully agree with this!!!! In my opinion, I wouldn't take it cause what if they was just saying they have my dog with no proof! What if they say they found it and oh it's a trap to rob you, we don't know what people are like these days, I don't carry money on me at all, and if amount was big I'd definitely not! So op could have been genuine, how ever he is not the asshole! Mum gets nothing cause she didn't find it, and she could have made up that her son has a brain problem to get the money?!", "What if she brought the reward, there was no dog (or a different dog), and OP was robbed of the reward money? I would not have brought it until after I confirmed the dog was mine.", "No. \n\nWhen you make a reward for something like this you go and bring the reward with you. That\u2019s how it works. \n\nOP didn\u2019t insist he take it, OP knew he would likely say no because that\u2019s what most would do. \n\nGo ahead and read some of OPs comments. Me thinks you\u2019ll change your view :)", "But if OP did want to pay they wouldn't care about whether they're  handing the reward money to the brain damaged man or his mother.", "Right but if you post a reward to find your dog and someone finds your dog, you should go GET the reward BEFORE you collect the dog. \n\nOP knew the man would decline. That\u2019s what most ppl would do in that situation. They were banking on it.", "If you're offering a reward, you should have the cash ahead of time ready to go. What if this guy had been an ass and said you're not getting your dog until i get my reward? I would sure want to have it on me.", "Op made a *written agreement* and posted it around town- so yeah.", "Look up what a unilateral contract is.   \n\n\nPeople who offer rewards but then don't pay them are asking to be brought to small claims court at minimum.", "This is by definition a contract.", "No, you\u2019re supposed to pay the reward at the time of collection. Do you think we need a handbook? Has society really deteriorated to the point where something like this isn\u2019t basic common sense?\n\nOP could have easily used Venmo or something similar.", ">Exactly! Where has humanity gone. Every act of kindness shouldn't have a price tag.\n\nYour other comment as quoted here is a big reason why a lot of people here are starting to doubt your original intentions.\n\nEdit: Lol now you've deleted it, but you still can't hide other people's replies to it. Why even bother coming here for a judgement if you're gonna backtrack and try to hide relevant info just to make yourself look good? YTA just for that.", "OP can still give the reward money directly to the man. If he then gives it to his mom to deal with for him, that's fine.", "I honestly have no idea what that is. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nBut your comment said that OP not bringing the reward meant OP banked on him not taking it, but using any form of bank transfer would not be \u201cbringing the reward\u201d. My point was just that not bringing the money does not indicate that OP did not intend to pay, if the rescuer had agreed to accept the money, as OP could have bank transferred the money.", "That\u2019s a great way to get set up and robbed.", "If my dog was lost, I'm not running an errand before getting to her, I'd offer PayPal or venmo on the spot, tho.", "I understand what you mean but sometimes it is also apparent that people may say they found your dog but they don't actually have the exact dog or try to pawn something off of you besides she was going to do so hopefully before the man changed his mind", "The fact OP even phrased it as a question is something I find issue with.", "Right. The point is you make it happen at the time of collecting the dog. That\u2019s how rewards work. \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t be going to get cash so I get it. But my point is OP put in very little effort to getting this person their reward.", "That's an excellent idea.", "So then you Venmo the guy money. \n\nAgain there\u2019s literally no excuse for not having a way to give the reward AT the time of collection. This is how found pet rewards have always worked, people.", "It's difficult to PayPal a stranger that doesn't wish to be paid.", "Of course he said no. Most ppl would if they are asked \u201cdo you want the reward\u201d. Op chose not to insist. She should have. To then immediately assume the alleged mother of this person is lying just makes it even worse.\n\nOp also made a comment that \u201cnot every good deed needs a price tag\u201d- which I agree with, but in this context there is obviously *some* kind of resistance against paying the reward."]}
