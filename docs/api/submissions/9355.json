(She was tangled in some brush in a ditch next to his yard). A neighbor with a flyer - who happened to be passing by called me, and I went and picked up my puppy. I was so happy to be reunited with her! And grateful for the man who found her.\n\nI asked the man if I could come back with the reward, as I did not have it on me. The man said he wasn't worried about the reward, he was just happy and surprised to find her. And glad that she was safe.\n\nSeveral hours after picking up my puppy, the man's mother texted me and said they want the reward. I text her back and told her what her son had told me, when I picked up my pup.\n\nShe then texted me back and said her son has a brain injury and doesn't always know what he is saying. And that she would be in contact again, to get the reward money.\n\nEdit, to add: I feel like the man was being a good Samaritan and knew what he was saying he didn't want any reward money. I feel like the man's mother is seeing this as an easy way to score some money. \n\nI'm thinking I may be the AH if I ignore the woman, since I did post a reward, even though her adult son said he didn't want the money. I am conflicted as to whether or not to give the reward to her (the man's mother who contacted me), as she is not the one who found my pup.\n\nEdit: I feel it is important to add here that I have zero problem with delivering on my reward offer, but only to the man who did free my pup and return her to me. I just feel like the mom is being shady and wants the money for herself. So I refuse to give it to her.

Give the reward money.\n\nETA to the man, not the mother.", "INFO: why didn't you bring the reward money with you when you went to pick up the dog?", "YTA It\u2019s called courtesy when sme does something nice and in this case finding your puppy the least you can do is giving a small token for your appreciation", "Yta. \n\nYou offered a reward, you should pay the reward.

No you can\u2019t take the puppy unless you bring me the money?  Come on. \n\nAlso, you can\u2019t tell just by looking at him if he has a brain injury. All the people saying \u201cwell he declined\u201d, would you be saying that if you knew for sure he hard a brain injury?  It was mentally challenged?  No. \n\nOp don\u2019t be a jerk. Go back and give the money to the man directly and insist he take it.", "You know, all of this depends on whether or not the son actually has a brain injury. If he does, it would suit you to reward him, whether or not he himself wants it, as he may not understand what it entails to take care of him. If he doesnt, then NTA. \n\nBut right now NAH", "YTA.\n\nFor all you know the mom could be telling the truth. I have no idea and really neither do you. I would probably send her the money strictly for the sake of appreciating her for bringing a child into the world who grew up and happened to help me with something significant (like finding a pet I love). \n\nThe fact you didint bring the reward with you and etc makes me think you were hoping that the guy would say no so as not to cause you the trouble. Which is pretty much what happened. \n\nIn the future when you promise a reward you make good on it. Don\u2019t be a liar. You show up cash or check or Venmo on hand and you pay the reward you promised because that\u2019s the right thing to do. And if the person refuses you insist.", "YTA.

However, the right thing to do is text her back, tell her you would be glad to give her son the reward, you want to thank him again, when is a good time to meet him?\n\nIf she gets squirrelly, just tell her you will give to son, she can be there, when is a good time?\n\nEdit, NTA in refusing to give the money to the MOTHER.

I would have had the reward money ready just in case.  Then you could have handed it to man and nothing that came after would have happened.\n\nHaving said that, since you didn't have it with you, why not just go back and give it to the man?  I don't get why this is such a difficult situation.\n\nAs for what the mother said, that is entirely possible.  I was staying with the husband of my cousin once while she did some shopping.  He was in an accident and was brain damaged and was much like a small child.  One of those people selling meat out of the back of his truck drove up and tried to sell him some.  I explained that he had no money and was not capable of making decisions and the meat seller STILL tried to sell him meat.  The man who found your dog might be in the same shape.\n\nI would take the reward back to them and if the man is there, give it to him.  If he's not, give it to the mother.  You made the offer and got your dog back.  The reward should be paid.", "NTA. I don't get a lot of the responses here, the person who helped you find your dog refused the reward. As far as I am concerned that is the end of the discussion. Sounds like the mother just wants free money to me.", "NTA she didn't find the puppy. That's it, anything else is irrelevant. He found d the puppy and denied the reward. She didn't find the puppy and therefore deserves nothing.", "NTA the only person who can claim the reward is the man who found your pup. \n\nHe probably doesn't have a brain injury and the mother just wants the money.", "NTA but my observation is you used a lot of words to tell us the man who found your pup didn\u2019t put forth a ton of effort. Not the point. \n\nIf you posted about a reward I would offer it to him again, with it in hand, and give him the option to accept or decline.\n\nI can see why his mom rubbed you the wrong way but don\u2019t let her effect what you do.", "You don't understand each other. It was the son's job to say no and your job to insist. If the son refuses three times then he really doesn't want the money. Go back with the reward and offer it to the son.

That should be the end of any such conversation.  Don't let some unrelated third party bother you any further about it.", "NTA\n\nWhat the mother said seems just like an excuse.

End of story.", "INFO - Are you sure that the ~~woman~~ person who texted you is really the finder's mom?\n\nBest solution would be to take the cash, return to the man who found the dog and offer it to him, if he declines it again, donate to local ASPCA or such.\n\nYWNBTA if you didn't give this woman anything.", "If you read what OP wrote, the man never actually declined the reward.

No need to give it to his mother.

But you don't have to do it", "NTA. The man, whether he actually has a brain injury or not 1) found the puppy himself, not his mom and 2) he did refuse the reward, after all. The mother basically isn\u2019t part of this situation other than being related to him.

You don't owe her anything and the guy declined.\n\nYou could pop by on your next walk with doggo to say thanks again- are you sure you don't want the reward money my guy, I have it right here?

I asked if he wanted me to make him one since the skillet was still hot, but he again responded in the same sarcastic tone that no, that's ok he didn't want an egg, and added that I was rude for not asking. I was confused, & asked why he didn't say anything earlier, & he said it's because he didn't want to be rude.  I said, by that logic, aren't you being rude now?  He said no because I should've asked.

Wishing you all the best!\n\nPut the money in the card, seal it up, make sure you place it in his hands \"wanted to give you a thank you card!\" and then let him open/process it on his own.\n\nI do disagree with one point, I *don't* think you should have his \"mother\" there. If it's a woman related to/with power over him she might just take the reward and maybe even harm him. She sounds unhinged.\n\nI wouldn't go too much into detail.

Those points are fact.  As a parent of a child who was oxygen deprived, if it were my child, I would respect their decision to decline the reward, but if I felt like they shouldn't have, I would call that person and set up a meeting to collect with my child so that they could accept, & I would never make a claim that it was also my reward.  This person texted telling op she needed to give them \"their\" reward, indicating they were also involved in finding the dog, which they weren't.  That is false.

The best way one ever handled this was saying something like \"I know you said we didn't need to pay you, but I'd really like to thank you for your help, can we compromise?\". It acknowledged my discomfort with the situation AND theirs so it felt... level, maybe? That's what I'd suggest trying with getting this man the reward money.

It would be pretty odd to say, \"aw thank you!\" and you'd be seen as conceited. \n\nWhen I moved to North America at 18, it took me a while to change these ingrained responses.
