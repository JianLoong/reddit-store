Our FSIL will be in some of the family shots, and she usually wears very large noise-cancelling headphones when she leaves the house because she can sometimes find noise quite overstimulating. (AFAIK she has not been diagnosed with autism, she has FND).\n\nI'm worried that the headphones would stand out too much in the posed family photos, so I floated the idea to my fiance of asking if she would be able to remove them for that short period of time (I'm not sure how long it would take but I'm guessing aproximately 5 minutes). He said he would feel very uncomfortable asking her to remove them as they are a disability aid - I replied to say I would be happy to facilitate this discussion with her and ask if she could maybe use earplugs, or if we could find smaller headphones that maybe aren't so noticable. After this he was more clear and said it's a 'no' from him on asking her.\n\nMy argument is that it would only be for the posed photos after the ceremony (again, there wont be many that she would be in), and I would be happy for her to keep them on for the ceremony and rest of the day. If we got the headphones edited out, it would be \u00a340 an hour for additional touch ups and editing done by the photographer.\n\nWIBTA?\n\nEDIT: To be clear FSIL is not my fiances sister, she is his brother's girlfriend (who will probably marry at some point)\n\nEDIT2: Fiance came back into the room and said he'd be open to talking about it with her next year in advance of the wedding.At the same time, I hear the response from you all! IWBTA. I really liked some of the other ideas presented here, maybe doing a private photoshoot so that its quieter for her, or offering to customise her headphones a bit so she can feel more festive - we havent picked out our colours yet, but what if she wants to wear a flower crown (as an example)? The possibilities are endless.Thank you everyone for your feedback.\n\nEDIT3: Just making it clear I'm not going to ask her anything or say anything to her until fiance and I are aligned.

Ywbta if you push it.", "YWBTA if you handle it as you've said here, asking her to remove them specifically for the photo. This *could* be a N A H situation *if you handle it correctly,* though. \n\nConsider the noise-canceling headphones to be a necessary piece of removable medical equipment, like glasses. \n\nSome people with glasses prefer to take the glasses off for photos. Others, like me, prefer to keep them on because they're part of my face and I feel like I look very strange without them. They make my nose look a LOT smaller lol, and like it actually fits on my face. I have anti-glare coating to make photos with my glasses easier so as to not cause glare problems. I always wear my glasses every day, so I feel like \"not me\" when I go without them-- like my face just doesn't *look right* to me. I still take them off if requested simply because even with the anti-glare coating, there can still be physical issues with lighting of glasses in photos; but I prefer not to. \n\nIf your FSIL wears the headphones *all the time,* she may consider them part of what she normally looks like. In this case, asking her to take them off would be asking her to *change herself* for your photos-- meaning you don't want HER to be in the photos, but you want someone who looks good according to your standards. Do you want photos with your family and loved ones, or photos with attractive people who meet your visual standards? If someone had a hair color you don't like, would you make that person wear a wig for photos? Would you make someone cover up a meaningful, non-obscene tattoo for photos? \n\nOn the other hand, if she *herself* prefers to take photos with the headphones off, then it's fine to ask her, because they're not part of her visual identity. \n\nDisabled people often consider our disabilities to be part of our identities. If you ask us to \"cover up\" those disabilities for a photo, it feels to us like you're rejecting *who we are* and preferring some version of us who doesn't actually exist.\n\nFor this reason, the way you need to ask the question is this: \"Do you prefer to wear your headphones for photos, or do you prefer to take them off? Either way is fine with me; I want you to feel most comfortable.\" If she wants to wear them, then you can ask clarifying questions about if she'd like a flower crown or other decorations in wedding party colors etc., or if she'd like to wear them as-is.\n\nBut if she prefers to keep them on, and if she prefers not to decorate or hide them, then *let her keep them.* In this case, it would probably be unacceptably rude to photoshop them out, too-- like you're rejecting who she is. Would you photoshop out a wheelchair user's wheelchair, or a prosthetic-wearer's prosthetic, and expect them to be okay with it? \n\nThe key part here is to *respect her preferences.* \n\nTl;dr It's fine to *ask her preferences* when it comes to wearing headphones for photos. It's NOT okay to *request* that she remove them if she doesn't want to.", "I think bedazzling or creating a flower crow is a great idea.\n\nPeople of Reddit please don't jump all over but I would like to ask an honest question because I truly don't know.

Noise canceling headphones filter out the sound of the dripping, and dampen the sound of the fan, and I think they also filter out the sound of the refrigerator humming to me (the refrigerator humming is less of a sound and more of a tangible sensation to me, like, oh, there is something Big and Electronic working away in the background)  \n\n\nSo they do filter out background noise, but whether or not the average person even notices the background noise that they filter out in the first place is up to the individual user. Some people can tune out the noises I described above much better than I can, to the point that they do not perceive hearing it-- or maybe they do not hear these noises at all. Noise canceling headphones probably do not offer much protection. Other people can hear these noises, and it can be as overwhelming for them as something like... the sound you hear inside a moving airplane, for example. While a room might be quiet to you, they might be able to hear all sorts of noises you can't (air flowing through vents, the humming of the HVAC system, the sounds that fluorescent light bulbs can make, even someone else chewing or breathing, even if these are all sounds you cannot hear, or can tune out more easily than they can). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of the time, I don't mind these noises, but when I am very stressed or ill, these noises can add to the other overwhelming physical sensations and cause upset. Even though these noises don't hurt me (some people experience physical pain as a result of too much background noise, even if it is low decibel, as a result of hearing sensitivity), it does take energy from me. Wearing headphones even on days when I am not overwhelmed makes it easier to navigate the world and conserves energy for things that truly matter, like cooking food or brushing my teeth before bed or even help me to fall asleep in my bed instead of on my couch (I work full time and am exhausted by the time I get home, so any scraps of energy I can save can go a long way!) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is just my experience- other people have very different experiences, but I hope this information helps you.", "That was my immediate thought\u2026\n\nIf FSIL is getting dressed up for the day, would she prefer to have minimum ear protection showing in the \u201cofficial photos\u201d? \n\nDoes she go out and about with friends and choose to have them on or off, if they take photos or she takes a selfie? \n\nIt sounds as if you\u2019re thinking ahead and considering her comfort\u2026 hopefully you can find a compromise based on her requirements. \n\nAnd maybe tell the photographer closer to the time, to minimise noise and fuss?

Also, in my experience, headphones can provide comfort because of the feeling of them on your head. It can go beyond overstimulation with her hearing and the feeling of not having them on could also cause discomfort for her. Also, to be more blunt, it is not be your business what her limits are, because she has probably been dealing with sensory issues her whole life and has likely already gone through multiple options to cope and aid her in her disability. Think of it like this: let\u2019s say a guest wears glasses, and you ask them to wear contacts instead because you don\u2019t want glasses in your wedding photo. They probably have already tried wearing contacts at some point and don\u2019t like the feeling of them, feel uncomfortable, etc. I wear glasses and tried contacts once - I felt very self conscious without my glasses and did not like the feeling of contacts. Plus, why would you want the photos to have a version of her that doesn\u2019t really look like her? If she always has the headphones on, that\u2019s her. It\u2019s just a few pictures, and likely not the ones you are going to be displaying in your home.

Also, if the brother\u2019s gf is in them, that means that other people may expect their girlfriends/boyfriends to be in them and then wonder why they aren\u2019t. If you just don\u2019t include boyfriends and girlfriends of family in the pictures, everything is solved. You don\u2019t need to think about the situation anymore, nobody will get offended, and people will not question that decision.\n\nI don\u2019t think discussing it with her is honestly a good option. It\u2019s just going to make her feel self conscious about her headphones, which is something that currently brings her a lot of comfort and helps her get through overstimulating situations. Weddings can be extremely loud and overstimulating.", "Doesn't matter who she is.\n\nWhat you are describing is a coping mechanism for someone who is neuro-atypical. Ableist AH always feel that they have the right to take these things away so that they can maintain the illusion of normalcy.

It can even help form a bond.", "And the thing is, about wedding pictures.  You look at them  *occasionally*.
