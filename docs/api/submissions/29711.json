Our FSIL will be in some of the family shots, and she usually wears very large noise-cancelling headphones when she leaves the house because she can sometimes find noise quite overstimulating. (AFAIK she has not been diagnosed with autism, she has FND).\n\nI'm worried that the headphones would stand out too much in the posed family photos, so I floated the idea to my fiance of asking if she would be able to remove them for that short period of time (I'm not sure how long it would take but I'm guessing aproximately 5 minutes). He said he would feel very uncomfortable asking her to remove them as they are a disability aid - I replied to say I would be happy to facilitate this discussion with her and ask if she could maybe use earplugs, or if we could find smaller headphones that maybe aren't so noticable. After this he was more clear and said it's a 'no' from him on asking her.\n\nMy argument is that it would only be for the posed photos after the ceremony (again, there wont be many that she would be in), and I would be happy for her to keep them on for the ceremony and rest of the day. If we got the headphones edited out, it would be \u00a340 an hour for additional touch ups and editing done by the photographer.\n\nWIBTA?\n\nEDIT: To be clear FSIL is not my fiances sister, she is his brother's girlfriend (who will probably marry at some point)\n\nEDIT2: Fiance came back into the room and said he'd be open to talking about it with her next year in advance of the wedding.At the same time, I hear the response from you all! IWBTA. I really liked some of the other ideas presented here, maybe doing a private photoshoot so that its quieter for her, or offering to customise her headphones a bit so she can feel more festive - we havent picked out our colours yet, but what if she wants to wear a flower crown (as an example)? The possibilities are endless.Thank you everyone for your feedback.\n\nEDIT3: Just making it clear I'm not going to ask her anything or say anything to her until fiance and I are aligned.

Ywbta if you push it.", "YWBTA if you handle it as you've said here, asking her to remove them specifically for the photo. This *could* be a N A H situation *if you handle it correctly,* though. \n\nConsider the noise-canceling headphones to be a necessary piece of removable medical equipment, like glasses. \n\nSome people with glasses prefer to take the glasses off for photos. Others, like me, prefer to keep them on because they're part of my face and I feel like I look very strange without them. They make my nose look a LOT smaller lol, and like it actually fits on my face. I have anti-glare coating to make photos with my glasses easier so as to not cause glare problems. I always wear my glasses every day, so I feel like \"not me\" when I go without them-- like my face just doesn't *look right* to me. I still take them off if requested simply because even with the anti-glare coating, there can still be physical issues with lighting of glasses in photos; but I prefer not to. \n\nIf your FSIL wears the headphones *all the time,* she may consider them part of what she normally looks like. In this case, asking her to take them off would be asking her to *change herself* for your photos-- meaning you don't want HER to be in the photos, but you want someone who looks good according to your standards. Do you want photos with your family and loved ones, or photos with attractive people who meet your visual standards? If someone had a hair color you don't like, would you make that person wear a wig for photos? Would you make someone cover up a meaningful, non-obscene tattoo for photos? \n\nOn the other hand, if she *herself* prefers to take photos with the headphones off, then it's fine to ask her, because they're not part of her visual identity. \n\nDisabled people often consider our disabilities to be part of our identities. If you ask us to \"cover up\" those disabilities for a photo, it feels to us like you're rejecting *who we are* and preferring some version of us who doesn't actually exist.\n\nFor this reason, the way you need to ask the question is this: \"Do you prefer to wear your headphones for photos, or do you prefer to take them off? Either way is fine with me; I want you to feel most comfortable.\" If she wants to wear them, then you can ask clarifying questions about if she'd like a flower crown or other decorations in wedding party colors etc., or if she'd like to wear them as-is.\n\nBut if she prefers to keep them on, and if she prefers not to decorate or hide them, then *let her keep them.* In this case, it would probably be unacceptably rude to photoshop them out, too-- like you're rejecting who she is. Would you photoshop out a wheelchair user's wheelchair, or a prosthetic-wearer's prosthetic, and expect them to be okay with it? \n\nThe key part here is to *respect her preferences.* \n\nTl;dr It's fine to *ask her preferences* when it comes to wearing headphones for photos. It's NOT okay to *request* that she remove them if she doesn't want to.", "I think bedazzling or creating a flower crow is a great idea.\n\nPeople of Reddit please don't jump all over but I would like to ask an honest question because I truly don't know.

Noise canceling headphones filter out the sound of the dripping, and dampen the sound of the fan, and I think they also filter out the sound of the refrigerator humming to me (the refrigerator humming is less of a sound and more of a tangible sensation to me, like, oh, there is something Big and Electronic working away in the background)  \n\n\nSo they do filter out background noise, but whether or not the average person even notices the background noise that they filter out in the first place is up to the individual user. Some people can tune out the noises I described above much better than I can, to the point that they do not perceive hearing it-- or maybe they do not hear these noises at all. Noise canceling headphones probably do not offer much protection. Other people can hear these noises, and it can be as overwhelming for them as something like... the sound you hear inside a moving airplane, for example. While a room might be quiet to you, they might be able to hear all sorts of noises you can't (air flowing through vents, the humming of the HVAC system, the sounds that fluorescent light bulbs can make, even someone else chewing or breathing, even if these are all sounds you cannot hear, or can tune out more easily than they can). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of the time, I don't mind these noises, but when I am very stressed or ill, these noises can add to the other overwhelming physical sensations and cause upset. Even though these noises don't hurt me (some people experience physical pain as a result of too much background noise, even if it is low decibel, as a result of hearing sensitivity), it does take energy from me. Wearing headphones even on days when I am not overwhelmed makes it easier to navigate the world and conserves energy for things that truly matter, like cooking food or brushing my teeth before bed or even help me to fall asleep in my bed instead of on my couch (I work full time and am exhausted by the time I get home, so any scraps of energy I can save can go a long way!) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is just my experience- other people have very different experiences, but I hope this information helps you.", "That was my immediate thought\u2026\n\nIf FSIL is getting dressed up for the day, would she prefer to have minimum ear protection showing in the \u201cofficial photos\u201d? \n\nDoes she go out and about with friends and choose to have them on or off, if they take photos or she takes a selfie? \n\nIt sounds as if you\u2019re thinking ahead and considering her comfort\u2026 hopefully you can find a compromise based on her requirements. \n\nAnd maybe tell the photographer closer to the time, to minimise noise and fuss?

Also, in my experience, headphones can provide comfort because of the feeling of them on your head. It can go beyond overstimulation with her hearing and the feeling of not having them on could also cause discomfort for her. Also, to be more blunt, it is not be your business what her limits are, because she has probably been dealing with sensory issues her whole life and has likely already gone through multiple options to cope and aid her in her disability. Think of it like this: let\u2019s say a guest wears glasses, and you ask them to wear contacts instead because you don\u2019t want glasses in your wedding photo. They probably have already tried wearing contacts at some point and don\u2019t like the feeling of them, feel uncomfortable, etc. I wear glasses and tried contacts once - I felt very self conscious without my glasses and did not like the feeling of contacts. Plus, why would you want the photos to have a version of her that doesn\u2019t really look like her? If she always has the headphones on, that\u2019s her. It\u2019s just a few pictures, and likely not the ones you are going to be displaying in your home.

Also, if the brother\u2019s gf is in them, that means that other people may expect their girlfriends/boyfriends to be in them and then wonder why they aren\u2019t. If you just don\u2019t include boyfriends and girlfriends of family in the pictures, everything is solved. You don\u2019t need to think about the situation anymore, nobody will get offended, and people will not question that decision.\n\nI don\u2019t think discussing it with her is honestly a good option. It\u2019s just going to make her feel self conscious about her headphones, which is something that currently brings her a lot of comfort and helps her get through overstimulating situations.

These are drastically different things. Also, the woman may be perfectly okay with doing it, if asked with kindness. It's not fair for others to decide FOR her.\n\nDisability aids are like seeing eye dogs, hearing aids, canes, and wheelchairs. Comfort aids are like purse dogs and noise canceling headphones, meaning they can make things EASIER and less stressful, and someone can get really used to relying on their comfort aids, but aren't really NECESSARY in the way an oxygen mask is necessary.\n\nA comfort horse may calm someone's anxiety, but they can't bring it with them on a plane. A comfort cat may calm one person's anxiety while triggering allergies in others. There's eventually a line to where a single person's comfort infringes on other people.\n\nThe concept of sensory overload has basically two levels: social anxiety and true brain disorder. Yes, a wedding is stressful and noisy and can definitely trigger anxiety. \n\nA true brain disorder is shown either in early life or after a brain injury; it's where the brain has too many neorons firing and the person struggles to focus. It CAN be part of autism, or it can exist alone or with similar issues like fibromyalgia.\n\nI have the actual brain disorder (and fibromyalgia), but I prefer to avoid all but necessary large gatherings, shop from home when I can, work in a profession that's mostly quiet, and to find quiet sanctuaries when I do feel overwhelmed (like at Thanksgiving). I don't find headphones or earplugs helpful, since they just make my own body's sounds much louder in my ears.\n\nGranted,  I only go to weddings of people I'm extremely close to, and the picture parts are stressful, but then I go find a quiet place to decompress alone or maybe with one person.\n\nIf she's approached with you saying how you definitely want to include her and would it possibly be okay to take the headphones off just for a couple of minutes, she may be agreeable, especially if you can get the other wedding guests to be quiet for those poses and the photographer to not be loudly demanding (like some of them can get).\n\nHonestly, her using the headphones every second isn't healthy anyway. I wonder how often she uses them when just around her boyfriend. My point is that making her feel comfortable with your family may calm her anxiety enough that they're less necessary for her.\n\nThere's a difference between yanking them off her ears and just politely asking if it might be okay, just for a few minutes, and how you could accommodate her to make that happen. (Even a blind person could be far enough away from their seeing eye dog for long enough to take a picture, so I don't see it hurting this girl just to ask.)\n\nThat being said, your approach towards those protecting her from your request is another thing altogether. You might say something like, \"If I'm perfectly clear that no is an acceptable answer, could I possibly ask her how she feels about taking them off for just a minute and whether there's anything I can do to help her that would make it work?\"\n\nOr yeah, give her a headpiece that covers them up. Or use editing software yourself on those photos. But no, you're NTA. This is different than taking away someone's walker, although you'd keep that out of photos, too. \n\nBut wheelchairs would stay in, so you need to politely determine the girl's reliance on the headphones. But they're usually an anxiety aid, so try to focus on calming her anxiety.\n\nYou could also approach her as saying it's what you'd like for your wedding gift, since you know it's asking something difficult of her.\n\nIn my family, people know my pushing through my various health problems is often quite difficult, so I'm asked just to show up, not bring gifts.", "YWNBTA if you asked politely  and she said no and left it at that.

It easy for able-bodied people to say why don't you do x because it would be easier for everyone else.

It's not really blocking background noise - it's dampening all sound, including conversation.

And I will still be aware of the ambient background noise - it's just at a lower volume than normal. Honestly, I hate the experience a little bit - it's just plain _weird_.\n\nWith the more expensive ones, I can't hear normal conversations in the background, unless they're louder/more high pitched than average. I can however hear people speaking _to_ me/talking very near me - though it feels like someone put the TV at sleeping volume, and I have to strain to hear it.

Some might object to it as potentially tiptoeing around too much, which can be infantilizing (although I would argue that providing a polite way to ask for someone's preferences tends to *reduce* tiptoeing behavior by enabling them to ask more directly than they otherwise might). Everything I said should be taken as tendencies or possibilities, and I would recommend running it by other disabled people before distributing it. \n\nMy own disability is largely invisible and so I have mostly written this based on what I have read and learned from others whose disabilities are more visible (and from the observation that many able-bodied/neurotypical people just happen to be very attached to their visual identities in non-disability-related ways, too; the issue only becomes more fraught when it is related to marginalized groups).

The point I'm trying to make is one about kindness and politeness-- it's not about whether someone can *handle* a request, but more that it shouldn't be an issue of whether they can handle it anyways. I could handle someone walking up to me and telling me \"You're a stupid idiot and I hate you,\" and would be baffled rather than offended; but it's still not a nice thing to do, and I would advise someone against doing it. It doesn't say anything about my or anyone else's ability to handle things for me to say \"maybe don't do that.\" \n\nI also personally wouldn't be *offended* to be asked to remove glasses, even though it's not my preference and I do consider myself more \"me\" with them on. I tend to offer so as not to put someone in the position of having to ask, even. But it's worth noting that some people WOULD.\n\nBut some people really DO see their disability aids as part of their visual identity and, separately, many people also dislike perceived implications that their visual identity is not good or decent enough for formal photos. There is a real historical issue of disabilities being considered unfit for \"polite company,\" too, which might cause some to object on that basis. If you ask someone to change part of themselves for only photos, and not anything else, then does that mean that part of themselves is somehow too impolite or unworthy of being recorded and remembered? And since one can't know beforehand whether or not someone has that perception, it's only decent to ask their preferences first. \n\nWe have plenty of posts in this very subreddit of people being offended at being asked to cover up non-obscene tattoos for wedding photos, and those aren't related to disability at all. So the observation that people tend not to like it when you ask them to change part of their visual identity for photos is just that-- an observation. \n\nOf course, someone might not see things that way at all, or might *prefer* to have permanent records of themselves without reference to their disability.

If they are comparable, obviously airpods would be a nice gift for a similar effect.", "That's the thing, I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying but I also don't think the way OP wanted to approach the situation is wrong either. OP stated that she wears them when she leaves the house, not all the time so I doubt it's a part of their identity. But I also wouldn't have a problem if my friend asked me to be in her wedding and then requested to remove glasses, cover tattoos, take out piercings, or change my hair color to a more traditional color.
