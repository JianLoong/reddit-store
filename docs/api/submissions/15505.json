I have used this time to advance significantly in my career and save up as much money as possible, because I couldn't imagine ever wanting to be in a relationship again. Since I had nothing else going on I was able to work stupid amounts of hours which gave me many kinds of advantages in getting ahead. Since I reached a new level recently which counterintuitively is less stressful, and am now on track to retire by 45, I thought about dipping my toe into dating again.   \n\n\nI have been dating \"Brad\" for a few months, and we recently became official. We spend most of our time together out doing things, rather than at home, and tend to eat out. Recently Brad brought up how we should become more frugal. I actually am EXTREMELY frugal and live well below my means, so I already thought it was a bit weird to be included in that statement. (Although I do eat out often because I spend most of my time at work, it's cheap simple food mostly). However, I wanted to support Brad in becoming more frugal. I have cooked for Brad a few times before. So Brad suggested that this time, he cook dinner for us one night and \"in exchange,\" I would clean up.   \n\n\nI did not ask him to clean up when I cooked for him, but I thought this was fine, and agreed to it.   \n\n\nI arrived. Brad had cooked a pot roast and made a salad. This was fine by me, it was simple, tasted good, etc. He then said he would relax and watch TV while I cleaned up. This was my first surprise because he had made an absolute mess around his plate, and expected me to clear the whole table by myself. Okay fine, I loaded everything up and entered the kitchen. The kitchen looked like a tornado struck it. It seemed like every bowl, dish, plate, utensil, that he owned had been used, and there was spilled food, crumbs, and sauce everywhere, on the countertop, the over, and on the floor. I've never known him to be a slob before so I was shocked. I stood in the doorway and said \"REALLY???\" He seemed not to hear. I walked over and said, \"I wasn't expecting this level of mess.\" He got upset and said passive aggressively, \"well, I'm pretty exhausted after cooking for us while you did your own thing, but if you don't want to help clean, I guess I'll do that too.\"  \n\n\nI had never known him to be passive aggressive before either which is my number 1 turn off. I turned and went back to the kitchen and began cleaning. After 35 minutes of cleaning I felt as if I had not even made a dent. This would have taken hours to clean. All of a sudden I was over it, and I walked out, picked up my bag and just left. I messaged Brad that it was clear we were not compatible and I wished him the best of luck in the future. I expected that to be the end of it, but he's been blowing up my phone with how much of an asshole I am and the messages are only getting worse.", "created_utc": 1682264436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wff9j/aita_because_i_let_someone_cook_for_me_then_went/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was also thinking that is where it would go but it didn\u2019t.", "She said she\u2019d clean up.  She didn\u2019t.  She shouldn\u2019t have agreed to it if she didn\u2019t know him well enough to know he\u2019s a slob.  She\u2019s TA.", "Def more than the pot roast. Even if did literally nothing but make the food, it ain't more than 30 min of cleaning AFTER eating even", "Something just isn't adding up in the story for me.", "So you think she should have scoured his kitchen from top to bottom and not complained because she agreed to clean up after dinner? Even if he had several days worth of mess? And that she should just accept his AH behavior or else she's the AH? Nah dude.", "You are assuming it was several days\u2019 mess.  There is nothing that says that.  You and she are also assuming that her definition of clean and his are the same.  If there was several days mess then it would be obvious and she could have cleaned up just the mess from that night and not the rest.  Adults do what they say they are going to do.  This has nothing to do with his being a slob which he is for sure.  It also doesn\u2019t have anything to do with his being dishonest about the state of the kitchen and what \u201ccleaning up\u201d might entail.  It has to do 100% with her agreeing to do something without getting all of the facts and then being pissed that she didn\u2019t and blaming him for that.  She should have taken responsibility for her own actions.  After that if she decided to not date this guy then she would not be TA.", "You don't have to follow through with every agreement as an adult if there are conditional changes or if there are unanticipated expectations. She took responsibility, realized she didn't want to continue with the relationship and dipped. He then harassed her repeatedly. He is TA and she's well within her rights to say she's done.", "If you make pot roast and a salad it should be minimal mess. If she cleaned for so long and still had more then it\u2019s obvious to infer it\u2019s several days mess he is trying to \u201ctrick\u201d her into cleaning."]}
