Married 8 months, together for over 9 years. \n\n5 years ago I started a business. My wife signed on to help me and she has been a part of it the entire time on the board of directors. Fast forward, not to brag but we\u2019re quite successful. In 5 years we\u2019ve made about 1.5 million total, profitable every year we\u2019ve been open. I pay myself a monthly salary that pays for both of our living expenses and bills. We still have bills etc like anyone else. She had a lot of debt prior to our marriage. She does not work a day job and we both just work on this. \n\nEvery year, my wife has gotten increasingly irritable about the business to the point she has told me multiple times she wanted to quit, at which times I always told her I would be fine with that if we sat down and talked about it and had a game plan to replace her, I would never hold it against her or anything\u2026 but that I can\u2019t make that decision for her. Every time she chose to stay. Last night, was one of those nights she was arguing with me about the business. The team is proposing adding some things that will require additional planning and time commitment and this stressed her out. We argued about it because the things being added wouldn\u2019t take any additional effort from her or her team. During this argument she got so upset she left the room and slammed the door, then sent a message to her team group chat saying I was now in charge and then she left all business communications without any further word and told me she quits. \n\nNot gonna lie, it made me mad and I\u2019m still mad. I\u2019ve seen her give 2 weeks notice followed by months of additional work for companies and bosses she HATED but it feels like she\u2019s purposely putting me in a rock and a hard place because she can. It feels disrespectful. We spent all of last night talking about it and basically she feels like she isn\u2019t a good fit for the role due to her dislike of the work, but she doesn\u2019t really see what the problem is with the way she left things. She says she always imagined it would be this way. She keeps saying the business is bullshit and when I reminded her she benefits from that \u201cbullshit\u201d she just said she would either way since we\u2019re married. \n\nI\u2019m considering significantly reducing my salary to afford our living expenses and MY personal bills and telling her she needs to get a job to pay for her share of things. I don\u2019t see why I should have to pay her debt with my business for her to sit around doing nothing all day especially after she left things this way.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674761819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m0dog/aita_for_reducing_household_income_from_my/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you saying you want to reduce your income to force her to work because you don't want to be solely financially responsible?", "INFO: I read your comments that you both a get defined salary and now that she no longer works there you would no longer pay out her part of the salary. So far so good. Makes sense, she doesn\u2019t work so she doesn\u2019t get a salary. \n\nBut then you say that if she left in an orderly fashion you would be okay with it.

One is a business issue and the other a personal issue.\n\nYou started your business 5 years ago.  You don't say how long ago she became involved with the business.  You chose to marry 8 months ago.  You've both been working this business for a while, from the sound of it. \n\nIt is VERY unprofessional of her to decide to suddenly drop her tasks in the business.  She benefits from the business, and I'm guessing those tasks need to be completed, but what would you do if she were suddenly hit by a bus?  Always have a \"hit by a bus plan\".\n\nAt the same time, I totally understand you not wanting to fully support her and her poor economic choices if she is choosing not to work.  She can't bring in debt and expect you to cover it while she does nothing. \n\nIt sounds like you both need counseling, both of a financial type and partnership type.

It is even more stressful when it is your only source if family income, and when one of the parties doesn't like the business.", "I'm going with YTA.\n\nIt's sketch af that after you got married you folded her salary into yours instead of continuing to pay her.

She can\u2019t quit and still expect a salary. Considering she brought that debt into the marriage, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable that you expect her to pay for it. I do think you should have listened to her earlier when she said that she wanted to quit, but it\u2019s pretty convenient timing that in < year of getting married she wants to quit working. If you imagined your marriage / household as a dual income you need to discuss that now. \n\nThe place where you sound like an ah is when you say you\u2019re cutting the salary to punish her/ force her to work. You\u2019re stopping her salary bc she no longer works there. It sounds like you would be okay with lowkey fraud/ a shadow employee and care less about the company financials than proving a point. \n\nFor now NTA bc this seems theoretical, but you\u2019re in pretty thin ice.", " She supported and helped you start your business, but she's not obligated to forever be a part of it. If she finds it stressful and frustrating to be there let her leave without punishing her. If she expected you to keep \"paying her salary\" that's different, but from what you describe, only your salary provided the income, why wasn't your wife on the payroll?\n\nShe's only the ass-hole if she just decided on her own to be a housewife without coming to an agreement with you, but even then punishing her would be childish and wildly unhelpfull.\n\nETA", "You would be TA if you do like you say and reduce your salary just to force her to get another job. I get it, she is definitely TA in the way she handled quitting, but it's not like you didn't know how bad she hated the job. If you want to avoid being TA, sit and have a talk with her and explain that you feel disrespected and that you do expect her to work in some capacity. Work something out. But don't hold finances over her. That's not what a partner should do. If she isn't willing to work something out with you, then you split up if you can't deal with how she wants things, and same with her. But no partner, no matter which, should ever hold finances hostage as a way to try to force the other into doing something. For now, ESH until you either work out a solution or split up.\n\nETA: I'm not sure if I understood right or not, but if you weren't paying her, you're TA. She was an employee, not your wife, doing work. If you didn't pay her, you get absolutely NO say in how she quits or how much/little she wants to work.", "ESH. \"I would never hold it against her\" but you're so pissed at her that you're going to withhold financial security? From what I can parse from your comments throughout the thread, it sounds like before you got married you paid her a salary like a regular employee but after you got married you *stopped paying her* and instead just combined her salary and yours into (hopefully) a joint account? Is that right? YTA for that alone, if she had less than 100% access and control over her own salary. Why not just continue to pay her what she earned? Can you see how it seems controlling of you to not only not pay her separately, but also cut her off the minute you have a disagreement? She's not just an employee, she's your *wife.* She handled quitting badly, but you're retaliating out of anger.\n\nWhen a couple is in a position for one of them to stay home because the other can provide for both of them, that's a conversation both partners have together. It's not a unilateral decision either of you gets to make. You need to sit down together and talk about how your relationship and finances are going to work going forward.", "[deleted]", "SO you pay yourself twice the amount into ONE account.  that right there is a big red flag. Not only for tax reasons but also due to your wife never got paid.  Money was always in joint account, to go on joint things.  Unlike most people who get paid and can choose to have money put in a separate account.\n\nI get the feeling that creative book keeping is going on here.  YTA.  I bet the many times you talked to her and got her to stay she just agreed to shut you up rather then wanting to do the job.  Maybe stop and think, after the first 2 times she wanted out you could have come up with an exit plan for her.", "I'm leaning YTA. \n\n1) You say you were paying yourself a salary enough to cover both your bills.  Was she getting a separate salary?  If not, YTA.\n\n2) You say \"She does not work a day job, but we both work on this.\" YTA. Yes, yes she did have a day job, sounds like she was a manager for your business. \n\n3) She's been telling you for a while she's unhappy and planning on leaving. YTA for not finding out what her root cause for dissatisfaction was, actually LISTENING to her issues, and then trying to find a solution to those issues (bad personnel management, irrespective of her being your wife, I think you need some management and communication training). \n\nYes, she was unprofessional in leaving the way she did....but think of this....would you still be in punishment mode (and you are) if she had left a job that way that wasn't related to you and your business? \n\nYep, I'm sticking with YTA.", "Honestly, NTA. You kept giving her an out, she kept not taking it. Then, she finally got too stressed and acted on her want to leave. However, she wasn't entirely wrong about still benefiting from the business, depending on if you guys have a prenup, separate accounts, etc. But, none of that excuses her quitting without notice. I actually agree she should get a job too continue contributing financially to the household. That being said, I think you should wait a day or two for the emotions to level out, and then calmly discuss with her how she wishes to go forward. She's done with the buisness, there's no point in discussing that. This is all about her, and how she wants to go forward.", "YTA.  You never once mention paying her a salary so she worked to help build up your business and saved you the cost of an employee.", "So you have a successful business that your wife helped you build and now she isn\u2019t conforming you are going to resort to financial abuse? My ball I\u2019m off home type mentality. I\u2019m currently the breadwinner in my home as my husband sets up his own business and I would never dream of making him feel worthless and trapped like that. YTA", "NTA OP and let's stick with the point in hand...I'm not going to go down the salary hole that EVERYBODY seems to be doing.  You should be going to your wife and tell her that while she'll be missed because she was such a great asset to the company, that she's going to need to start working somewhere to help with the bills and her debt.  I wish you the best.", "YTA, possibly in the early pole position for the end of year roundup. You\u2019re a nightmare of a boss, and an even worse partner. I can only imagine the amount of labour she does that you just gloss over. Then you stick the dismount by trying to muscle her into regretting being overwhelmed, you really are a prize aren\u2019t you?", "NTA - She did this very unprofessionally. However now you know why going into business with family is not always a great idea. Not only can you have issues like this, but you also put all of your eggs into one basket and if the business fails, you both lose your income.\n\nProbably better she gets a day job doing something else and you replace her. Sure it will be a busy/hectic period while you find a replacement, but that's just business. Don't let this ruin a marriage.", "Nta. Both of you were working for business to get 2 paychecks.

Should she have given notice yes. Does she deserve a salary for doing nothing no. But if you\u2019re make 1.5 million in profit and she\u2019s been working the business since you started it. The family is making a lot of money in profit separately from the salary or your fucking the federal government on taxes.

I think it's totally valid to not want to have a relationship where your wife is a dependent, because that influences your family life.  It impacts a lot of small and big things in a relationship and is not just something she can dictate without input from a partner.  However, I think it's irrelevant and distracting to frame it as something you can't afford.  I think it crosses sane boundaries for work/life balance to use your new power over your partner as a dependent to lash out for her bad behavior as an employee with the company.

Now she's using this against you, and I don't really blame her. It feels like a punishment, whether you mean it to be or not, where it wouldn't have if you'd had her salaried separately.
