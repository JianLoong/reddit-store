She was raised in a city so has little exposure, likes cats (we have one), but not big dogs. She's not crazy about it nor does she make a fuss if dogs are present: she's just a bit nervous/jokes about them eating her. I'm apathetic to dogs so I think thats funny, but I guess dog lovers may disagree?\n\nJenny and James had one, a sleepy greyhound. Last year they got 2 more, big mixes (technically one of these XL bulldogs). [XL Bully](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bully)\n\nThey brought all 3,  and the two new ones were kind of stressed (since it's a new place). My parents werent too happy as they had to lock away their cats, but it was for 1 day so they didn't complain.\n\nJames gave us treats to give to introduce ourselves. Lara made the \"don't eat me\" joke as always when she gave the treat, and Jenny rolled her eyes. Our son Marc wanted to try, but Lara and said no and told him to go give a treat to the greyhound. I agreed, the other two were tense and the greyhound was used to kids. Jenny shook her head, scoffing \"townies\".\n\nWe're having a good time in the sitting room, dogs are in the attached lounge. Soon, Marc falls asleep and Lara had him on her lap for a bit then gave him to me. My mother offered some earmuffs for him and Lara accepted but said to not to go to more trouble.\n\nJenny said we can just put him in the next room (lounge) and the dogs can watch over him, and Lara laughed a bit and said no, Marc is fine here. I agreed, said he's a sound sleeper.\n\nJenny changed her mood, and accused Lara of \"stigma\" against the dogs. Lara said it's not stigma but that Marc is quite naughty and can walk, so he may get up and annoy the dogs... which he WOULD, we only just got him to stop thinking pulling the cats tail is hilarious. Jenny got angrier, told us the stigma comes from parents who \"don't train their brats but expect us to send dogs to military school\"\n\nI said that's bullshit, she's overreacting, when she called Lara a townie. My dad agreed with us, said a 2y/o should be supervised. Lara added Marc grew up with our cat, so even though we tell him not to annoy animals, he may still do it when unsupervised since a) he's 2 and b) he's used to our cat's reaction (nothing) and assume dogs will react the same. \n\nJenny cried, said she feels ganged up on, and we're adding to breed stigma. She left early, writing threads on FB all day (on Christmas!) about people who believe misinfo about \"evil\" dogs. James is chill, but asked us to apologise and let Marc play with the dogs next time as she was giving him hell. We are OK to apologise but DONT want to let Marc play unsupervised and feel thats not fair to ask.\n\nAITA? We'd love \"dog peoples\" opinion too, as we aren't. But we didn't criticise dogs, we said our sons age is the issue! Did we get it wrong?\n\nEdit: Hey, thanks all, but I can't seem to reply to any comments due to POO mode. I just wanted to answer here about \"training our son\": yes we are obviously teaching him how to be gentle, but \"pulling cats tail is funny\" is pretty normal behaviour that any 2 year old needs to be taught not to do, especially when the cat in question doesn't actually react to him - its not a sign of being spoiled, I know many children between 2-4 who need to be corrected about being gentle. Which is why we ALWAYS will supervise any child of that age around animals, but we don't think a 2 year old needing to be corrected is a sign of bad parenting. My dad was even sharing stories about how James used to try and put our old cat in the bathtub when he was 3 to \"give it baths\". We aren't going to put our son through boot camp just so that Jenny gets to see him interacting with her dogs, we will be correcting him and making sure he learns to be gentle with animals at a speed all children learn this - so that we can avoid any big accidental \"learning of the lesson\" that causes a lifelong injury to the animal or the child. \n\nAlso yes, we are in the UK. My family live in the country, Lara is from London, which is why the \"townie\" thing irritated me as most of these dog attacks happen in the city anyway...", "created_utc": 1703611545, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18rd5zu/aita_for_telling_my_sil_she_was_overreacting_over/", "score": 548, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He doesn\u2019t know how to read their body language, they don\u2019t know how to treat small human who may tug and pull on them. And a new environment where they aren\u2019t comfortable is not the place to have a dog be an ambassador for their breed.", "NTA. It's just smart not to leave a toddler or any small child unattended around dogs regardless of size or breed. It seems like you have a good handle on reading the dogs body language and can tell which ones are safe for your son to interact with and which ones aren't - nervous, tense dogs in a new environment are NOT ones you want to let your toddler wander up to or offers treats to. Your SIL is absolutely overreacting. You are under no obligation to allow your small child to play with the dogs, even supervised, to pacify your SIL. \n\nI will say, however, that the \"don't eat me\" joke sounds like it's gotten a bit old and tired. Your wife might want to get some new schtick. It doesn't make either of you an asshole in any way, but at a certain point stuff like that gets repetitive and not funny anymore.", "NTA. Jenny doesn't sound like a good pet owner. She imposed 2 new nervous animals to a family party and expects that a toddler be left alone with them. She's both overly sensitive and sounds like she's irrational. Don't ever leave your son alone with these pups as they are unlikely to be trained.", "NTA. At all. From someone who was in the same room as my mother when I was VICIOUSLY attacked and almost kille by a dog, do not ever leave your children unsupervised with a dog. Even if it's the family dog. Because it takes one wrong move from the child and it could be life changing. \n\nYour SIL is crazy. 2 years old alone with a dog, is not good parenting. Or good dog ownership. Do not apologize to her. She cried because her dogs were bullied. Please. She needs a reality check if she thinks that is an appropriate reaction.", "NTA at all. Not sure what your sil is expecting you to do here to \"apologise\": lock your toddler in a room with two bulldogs to \"prove\" that they're gentle? Does she want you to film the damn thing for UFC? I don't understand why she seems to think telling you to put your kid in the same room unsupervised is in any way a non-deranged thing to ask. I wouldn't let a 2 year old unsupervised with 99.9% of humans, let alone dogs. \n\nAlso, an opinion from the UK where I assume you are due to dog terminology: I don't have many informative opinions about that dog breed, but the one factual opinion I do have after almost a year of coverage of said breed is that it is objectively *not* a breed to leave alone with a child, let alone a toddler who would, as you say, definitely try to piss it off.\n\nEdit: re the breed, what I'm saying is that I'd not leave a child (especially one in its terrible twos!) alone with any dog, but especially not with strange dogs who have never met it + are objectively responsible for several attacks and injuries in the UK, many on children.", "I have a greyhound mix, and have grown up with \u201ceasy going\u201d dogs.

It\u2019s about knowing that every dog has a breaking point (especially with children) and knowing the consequences of letting the dog go past that breaking point. A greyhound will probably not do much harm, but a bully that (maybe rightfully) tries to get the child to stop pulling the tail, could possibly kill that child. The fact that your SIL thinks that the bully should get the same treatment (and probably training) as a greyhound, would be reason enough for me to keep any children away from her dogs.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you never EVER leave children ESPECIALLY such a young child alone with a dog. That is how children get bit; your sister is doing her dogs injustice with her \u201coh dogs are dogs,\u201d attitude that is what gets dog in trouble.

She was a rescue, so she has weird reactions due to her past that we have no clue about,  one of which was that children scared her.  My parents had to put alot of time and energy into getting her and the nieces/cousins to work towards being friendly, since little kids act irrational most of the time,  the erratic movement and noise would confuse the dog. Nta, unless you raised the dog from birth, you don't know it's trauma or how it will react to new stimuli,  and even if you have,  they're animals and might react differently than expected.

However, your response/request was entirely reasonable. Your son is two so too young to fully understand how to behave around the dogs, who were naturally nervous being in a new environment surrounded by lots of people they didn\u2019t know and the smell of cats.

I've known a dozen small breed dogs that would bite at any given chance. The problem is, if a chihuahua decides its going to bite, you might have a puncture wound and at most will need a few stitches. If a bully breed bites, especially a child, you're looking at potentially catastrophic injuries requiring extensive reconstructive surgery or even death.

Of the five worst bites injuries I've seen in that time, 4 were from pit bulls or pit bull mixes (the 5th was a Belgian Malinois, fwiw). \n\nYour SIL is getting up in arms over nothing.

She needs to understand that for a dog pack, killing smaller animals is the most natural thing in the world.

A child could easily hurt an old, fragile dog. Its the reverse situation from the OP's since, in his case, the threat is towards his child. But a 2 year old wouldn't completely understand how to handle any pet properly and safely when left to their own devices. It's great that the OP and his wife are teaching him but he's definitely not ready to be around pets -- especially big ones -- alone.", "You've obviously never worked in the veterinary industry if you think a chihuahua can't do damage.

We give people who commit horrible crimes second chances. Hell, we let people who commit horrible crimes off scott free and allow them to be in society. \n\nIf you are a good owner who knows your dogs limits and takes care of them, a reactive dog can have an amazing and fulfilling life. Bad owners make bad dogs.\nYou've been on banpitbulls too much and I know I won't change your mind and honestly don't care to.

They are super affectionate & playful, especially the 6 yr old Bully - he seems to think his 100 lb self is a 5 lb lap dog. Even though we know the way they are with us, our kids & extended family and friends, we're ALWAYS super cautious about introducing them to others and especially other dogs. The 6 yr old is rather protective, especially of me - even with my husband. We've never had any issue with either of them meeting new people, but they have almost always been leashed/vested and held by husband, at the time. We would never assume that everything will be just 'fine' just because they're 'good boys' with us. SIL is backwards in her thinking concerning her dogs. You NEVER can be sure how the dogs will react, even to someone they know...because they are ANIMALS. SIL absolutely needs to be educated and realize her feelings about her dogs don't trump the necessary safety precautions that should be taken in their presence.  \n\n\nWhen my daughter was 3/4 she was 'attacked' by our female Blue-tick Beagle (passed away 5 years ago). She was a very gentle, affectionate,  playful dog, but reacted as any normal dog wouldd in the situation. The dog was laying at the opposite end of the couch from me, head at edge of seat cushion. Daughter was sittiing on the floor in front of her, petting and talking to her. She started getting right up in the dog's face, which after a few minutes began irritating the dog. I had my daughter move away and told her stop and that she was bothering the dog. Being almost 4 yrs old, daughter came back a few minutes later wanting to sit by the dog. I was fine with it as long as she wasn't bothering her, and at first they were both content with daughter occasionally petting her, she even rolled a bit wanting belly rubs. I got up after a few minutes and walked into the kitchen to grab a drink, and daughter apparently started getting up in the dogs face talking to her again. I heard her low growl, and immediately told daughter to get up and walk away, as I was walking back into the room. She stood up to move away, but just as I sat down she bent down to kiss the dog's head and that's when it happened.  The dog instantly went at her, nipping her on her face and head. She did not fully bite her, but did cut her under the eye as she swung her paw. The dog never moved out of the spot she was laying in. It was literally a few seconds, incredibly scary, and totally my daughter's fault. Though, we weren't happy about it, the dog was only reacting as she knew how to when being provoked.\nTook daughter to the ER for the cut since we couldn't get it to stop bleeding and it looked deep. It was  just an inch across and only needed one stitch and she was perfectly fine, otherwise. Out of the several places we saw her get nipped , only two had barely broken the skin,  were cleaned to be safe and we went on our way. \n\n\nA report on our dog had to be made by the hospital and someone had to come out and observe our dog.  They determined, after interviewing everyone who was present ( myself, husband, my sister, and daughter) that the dog was just being a dog, and wasn't a 'threat'. Daughter & dog never had another issue. Neither was afraid of or nervous around the other, acted completely normal as if nothing had ever happened. Daughter understood that doing certain things she thinks are fun, or sweet, or were just 'playing' to her, didn't mean the dog felt the same way. We had already been teaching her warning signs from the dogs, but after this happened we thought maybe we weren't hitting all the marks, so we had a trainer who works with integrating adopted animals into new families come and work with us and the dogs. The trainer explained that what happened was a warning and that animals don't always give one. My daughter was extremely lucky that what happened wasn't much worse. We know that it absolutely could've been. \n\n\nYou & wife absolutely did the right thing and don't owe any kind of apology. Despite what your SIL thinks or feels, the safety of the humans in the presence of her dogs ALWAYS needs to come first. If she can't handle people not wanting to interact with her dogs, she needs to keep them at home or board them if she doesn't want to/can't leave them alone.", "NTA.

Bully breed advocates do like to bring out the statistics and say things like 'well technically, labradors bit more people in 202x', which may be true, maybe more people had to get treatment for bites from labradors (One of the most common breeds to own), but of FATAL dog attacks, Labs don't even come close.", "I'm so sorry to hear this. It's something I worry about every time I see a dog off leash, esp without its owner. And I love dogs, have had dogs my whole life!", "THIS. I am a dog owner and lover, and I'm still frustrated many of us don't understand that dogs will be put down if they hurt other people - and yet many owners put the dogs in situation where they fail and lose their lives in the process.", "For kilograms to pounds multiply by 2.2 - so 25 kgs is 55 lbs.", "They\u2019re pit bull adjacent dogs, they\u2019ll eat the walls, couch and front door.", "Let me clarify. \n\nI rescued this dog. When I say she was a nanny dog, I mean she was left by crackheads to take care of kids and did her job as well as a dog could, including saving the toddler that left after his mom died and it was just the 3 of them.\n\nEdit: but on a further note hard eye roll at you cause she\u2019s a fuckin queen and deserves credit even if her masters were shit.", "What would the safety profile be of a retired greyhound versus an XL Bully?\n\nI don't know much about dogs but read that XL Bullys are part terrier and their attack is designed to snap the neck, similar to how small terriers are used for killing rats.\n\nI've seen videos of terriers used for clearing out rat nests and it's insane how efficient they are. The thoughts of a much bigger, much stronger version of that dog anywhere near a small kid who it decides needs to be eliminated is terrifying, the kid would not have a chance.", "Please show me a death from a chihuahua that was caused solely from a mauling. You can\u2019t.\n\nPitbulls and the majority of bully breeds are the dogs which cause the most catastrophic injuries and deaths.", "Our Kelpie X nipped my foot last month when my toddler accidentally fell on his arthritic shoulder (he was at my feet, and she was trying to climb up onto my lap for cuddles). We were lucky it was me and not the toddler, but he panicked when he realised what he had done then went and hid for an hour when he realised who he did it to. When he came back out (he put himself to bed instead of laying at my feet) he came and licked my foot to say sorry and I gave him some love and attention so he knew I was ok but that is the exact reason why we never leave our dogs and kids unsupervised together. Accidents can happen, and it's the dog owners responsibility to try and minimise the risks.", "US, I think it\u2019s pretty normal here to own bullies Where are you? I\u2019ve never heard of bullies being illegal except in some European countries", "The bullies are bred for muscle over everything else.  That means that when they bite they bite a lot harder than most dogs.\n\nPersonally, I find them really hard to read.  They have small ears that don't move much, *short* fur, and in the USA they also have cropped tails.  How do you tell in the ears are laid back or relaxed? If the tail is wagging or tucked? They don't look much different when angry vs relaxed, and OP says they were obviously agitated at the new environment.\n\nI don't care if they were beagles or golden retrievers.  Don't leave a toddler alone with dogs   If dogs are visibly distressed, *definitely* don't leave a toddler alone with them.", "Well, when it comes down to it, any dog can be dangerous if he\u2019s a mind to. Greyhounds have very big mouths and the usual complement of teeth and they can move pretty fast. I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to tangle with one. \n\nBully breeds are tough. They are very stigmatized here in the US and our group wouldn\u2019t place a greyhound in a home with one. One of our adoption coordinators had her very first greyhound get badly attacked by one while out on a walk. It just busted through the neighbor\u2019s screen door and was on her. That being said, I\u2019ve met some very sweet bullies and chatted with folks dedicated to bully breed rescue. I\u2019m pretty much of the opinion that there are no bad dogs, just bad owners,  but bully breeds can be a lot to handle and they\u2019re not a learner dog. \n\nOP\u2019s sister is a horror show of a dog owner. Your job is to keep your animal safe and the people around your animal safe and she is failing that on all accounts.", "Honestly my dog is a 40lb, 15 year old sweetheart. He's just a sweet old man. \n\nOld dogs are even more dangerous around children because they're old. \n\nEverything has an instinctive pain response. Everything. And old dogs have a lot of sensitive spots. People who let their toddlers clamber over dogs are just asking that dog to snap instinctively at the source of pain. And for a small child this can be a devastating injury.", "Just checked and German Shepherds are actually the breed that has the most severe bites, followed by pit bulls, which has been consistent from 1970s-2018. After pit bulls, it's Labradors, Collies, then rottweilers. But that's only for dogs where breed is identified. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33136964/\n\nA second study showed that fatal bite incidents were most likely to be German shepherds and pit bulls; another source said pit bulls and Rottweilers. A third source said pit bulls were the cats of most fatalities in the mid-00s-late 2010s (this one was not published as a paper or peer reviewed). Another study showed shih tzus as most likely to bite children 0-3 years of age, then pit bulls. \n\n Multiple studies did mark pit bulls as having more severe bites (again, all this is just for incidences where breed can be identified, and there's data collection issues with how breeds are identified in the studies, usually well-documented in the studies. See https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26403955/ for visual identification issues ) The data showing increased dog aggression in pit bulls is a lot stronger than data supporting increased human aggression. \n\nFar more strikingly, is the association of dog bite related fatalities with poor ownership - one study found that 80% of fatal dog bites had at least 4 markers of poor ownership: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24299544/ \n\nIn comparison, a study on breed bans in Denmark shows very minimal effect on bite-related hospitalizations: \nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208393\n\nWhich is to say - the important thing here really isn't the breed of the dog. It's that children shouldn't be left unsupervised with any dogs AND should be kept away from interacting at all with dogs that look uncomfortable, particularly unknown dogs that look uncomfortable. \n\nThe OP made the right decision, but it was the right decision regardless of breed. Supervised interactions with known, relaxed dogs, and no interaction for unknown dogs that are uncomfortable.", "Sure, inbreeding in other breeds leads to a host of horrible problems. XL bullies, though? They're on a whole other level.", "Plus, dogs are more likely to see small children as prey than humans. They just don't register children as humans a lot of the time.", "Exactly! I don't see a single bit where he or his wife had actually blamed the dogs, they were very clear that their son was at a \"naughty\" age and would definitely mess with the dogs the minute he woke up, because he was being taught at home not to piss animals off so, like any toddler, would immediately do that exact thing if he sees his parents aren't there. I have no clue what the SIL is so pissed off at, it's not like the guy and his wife started crusading about bully breeds.\n\nAlso OP's family seems to own a very placid cat who tolerates prodding, same with the old greyhound, so the child would have absolutely no idea what an angry animal would do, all he knows is that mum and dad said no - it honestly makes me shudder to think of the worst case scenario."]}
