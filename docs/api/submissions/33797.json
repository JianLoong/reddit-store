My parents werent too happy as they had to lock away their cats, but it was for 1 day so they didn't complain.\n\nJames gave us treats to give to introduce ourselves. Lara made the \"don't eat me\" joke as always when she gave the treat, and Jenny rolled her eyes. Our son Marc wanted to try, but Lara and said no and told him to go give a treat to the greyhound. I agreed, the other two were tense and the greyhound was used to kids. Jenny shook her head, scoffing \"townies\".\n\nWe're having a good time in the sitting room, dogs are in the attached lounge. Soon, Marc falls asleep and Lara had him on her lap for a bit then gave him to me. My mother offered some earmuffs for him and Lara accepted but said to not to go to more trouble.\n\nJenny said we can just put him in the next room (lounge) and the dogs can watch over him, and Lara laughed a bit and said no, Marc is fine here. I agreed, said he's a sound sleeper.\n\nJenny changed her mood, and accused Lara of \"stigma\" against the dogs. Lara said it's not stigma but that Marc is quite naughty and can walk, so he may get up and annoy the dogs... which he WOULD, we only just got him to stop thinking pulling the cats tail is hilarious. Jenny got angrier, told us the stigma comes from parents who \"don't train their brats but expect us to send dogs to military school\"\n\nI said that's bullshit, she's overreacting, when she called Lara a townie. My dad agreed with us, said a 2y/o should be supervised. Lara added Marc grew up with our cat, so even though we tell him not to annoy animals, he may still do it when unsupervised since a) he's 2 and b) he's used to our cat's reaction (nothing) and assume dogs will react the same. \n\nJenny cried, said she feels ganged up on, and we're adding to breed stigma. She left early, writing threads on FB all day (on Christmas!) about people who believe misinfo about \"evil\" dogs. James is chill, but asked us to apologise and let Marc play with the dogs next time as she was giving him hell. We are OK to apologise but DONT want to let Marc play unsupervised and feel thats not fair to ask.\n\nAITA? We'd love \"dog peoples\" opinion too, as we aren't.

This nonsense from your SIL is the kind of ignorant attitude and behavior from dog owners that gets children and other pets killed, not to mention the dogs they supposedly love put down. You and your wife are right not to let your child around any dog unsupervised, but especially not big bully breeds who are nervous and don\u2019t know the kid.

Most certainly don't let your kid play with the dogs. If you are OK with apologizing, make sure your wife apologizes for her \"don't eat me!\" \"joke,\" as it's not funny, it seems she repeats it a lot, and it's annoying.

It doesn't matter what their relationship is, at the end of the day it's still an animal. And in this case, you only just met in laws' dogs, and they were stressed. SIL is delusional. I'm na huge animal lover, but I don't ever let my dogs alone near my grandson. They aren't used to kids and they are far bigger than he is.

A 2-year-old who's only just stopped pulling the cat's tail shouldn't be unsupervised around a turtle or a rabbit, much less two large dogs who could literally bite his face off if he provoked/scared them enough. \n\n(There are a lot of dog attacks where I am, often involving children.)\n\nYou're NTA and your sister has issues. You and your wife and your parents were all reasonable and handled everything perfectly.", "NTA.

Stay home if you can\u2019t leave your pets at home.", "NTA Hi huge dog lover, said out loud \u201coh, it\u2019s a baby\u201d when I saw the picture on the linked Wikipedia page. \nA small child who is unused to dogs should not be left alone with two stressed out dogs. He doesn\u2019t know how to read their body language, they don\u2019t know how to treat small human who may tug and pull on them. And a new environment where they aren\u2019t comfortable is not the place to have a dog be an ambassador for their breed.", "NTA. It's just smart not to leave a toddler or any small child unattended around dogs regardless of size or breed. It seems like you have a good handle on reading the dogs body language and can tell which ones are safe for your son to interact with and which ones aren't - nervous, tense dogs in a new environment are NOT ones you want to let your toddler wander up to or offers treats to. Your SIL is absolutely overreacting. You are under no obligation to allow your small child to play with the dogs, even supervised, to pacify your SIL. \n\nI will say, however, that the \"don't eat me\" joke sounds like it's gotten a bit old and tired. Your wife might want to get some new schtick. It doesn't make either of you an asshole in any way, but at a certain point stuff like that gets repetitive and not funny anymore.", "NTA. Jenny doesn't sound like a good pet owner. She imposed 2 new nervous animals to a family party and expects that a toddler be left alone with them. She's both overly sensitive and sounds like she's irrational. Don't ever leave your son alone with these pups as they are unlikely to be trained.", "NTA. At all. From someone who was in the same room as my mother when I was VICIOUSLY attacked and almost kille by a dog, do not ever leave your children unsupervised with a dog. Even if it's the family dog. Because it takes one wrong move from the child and it could be life changing. \n\nYour SIL is crazy. 2 years old alone with a dog, is not good parenting. Or good dog ownership. Do not apologize to her. She cried because her dogs were bullied. Please. She needs a reality check if she thinks that is an appropriate reaction.", "NTA at all. Not sure what your sil is expecting you to do here to \"apologise\": lock your toddler in a room with two bulldogs to \"prove\" that they're gentle? Does she want you to film the damn thing for UFC? I don't understand why she seems to think telling you to put your kid in the same room unsupervised is in any way a non-deranged thing to ask. I wouldn't let a 2 year old unsupervised with 99.9% of humans, let alone dogs. \n\nAlso, an opinion from the UK where I assume you are due to dog terminology: I don't have many informative opinions about that dog breed, but the one factual opinion I do have after almost a year of coverage of said breed is that it is objectively *not* a breed to leave alone with a child, let alone a toddler who would, as you say, definitely try to piss it off.", "I have a greyhound mix, and have grown up with \u201ceasy going\u201d dogs. My parents wouldn\u2019t even let a two year old be alone with a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and I would never let my dog be alone with any child under the age of, say 12? \n\nThis is not about if XL bullys are considered dangerous in general. It\u2019s about knowing that every dog has a breaking point (especially with children) and knowing the consequences of letting the dog go past that breaking point. A greyhound will probably not do much harm, but a bully that (maybe rightfully) tries to get the child to stop pulling the tail, could possibly kill that child. The fact that your SIL thinks that the bully should get the same treatment (and probably training) as a greyhound, would be reason enough for me to keep any children away from her dogs.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you never EVER leave children ESPECIALLY such a young child alone with a dog. That is how children get bit; your sister is doing her dogs injustice with her \u201coh dogs are dogs,\u201d attitude that is what gets dog in trouble.

I trust both of my dogs with kids but would still never put them in a position where something could happen.", "My family has always had dogs,  my mother has a 75lb pit mix currently.  She was a rescue, so she has weird reactions due to her past that we have no clue about,  one of which was that children scared her.  My parents had to put alot of time and energy into getting her and the nieces/cousins to work towards being friendly, since little kids act irrational most of the time,  the erratic movement and noise would confuse the dog. Nta, unless you raised the dog from birth, you don't know it's trauma or how it will react to new stimuli,  and even if you have,  they're animals and might react differently than expected. I'd  mention to SIL that your apprehension was as much about the dog as your son,  no one wants a dog put down because it bit a child.", "NTA.

Jenny is talking from a place of hurt. There is a stigma against XL bullies, as some are owned by irresponsible owners who choose the dogs because they look \u2018hard\u2019 and don\u2019t train them, but that is not the fault of the dogs. However, your response/request was entirely reasonable. Your son is two so too young to fully understand how to behave around the dogs, who were naturally nervous being in a new environment surrounded by lots of people they didn\u2019t know and the smell of cats. Jenny is probably used to people unfairly judging her for her dogs, but she has gotten to the point that she is seeing judgement when it isn\u2019t there.", "Apologizing for what?!

Don\u2019t let them pressure you to apologize or that your little one plays alone with this unfamiliar dogs. That\u2019s ridiculous. Your child is your responsibility.

You have nothing to apologize for and shouldn't do so just so your brother can appease his insecure asshole of a wife.

Its clueless owners like these that give these breeds a bad name", "I have no experience with young kids, but is it normal for toddlers to pull cats\u2019 tails?", "Sounds like none of what you both decided as parents had to do with breed at all. She\u2019s the one who made it a breed stigma issue- you both had a lot of great points and concerns and frankly weren\u2019t making it her or anyone\u2019s problem so I don\u2019t see the issue here NTA", "This is not breed stigma, this is common sense. These dogs don\u2019t live with little kids and have only recently come into the home. I wouldn\u2019t trust them at all either and I have dogs. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, I have a dog who is just a giant snuggle bug and I would still never leave him alone with any child under 12, and older than that would fully depend on how good the child is with dogs. Dogs can get nervous and even the most well trained one can snap. Your SIL is delusional and is going to get a child really hurt with that kind of attitude.", "NT-  Dog lover here and you should never trust a toddler alone with dogs.  That\u2019s bad pet ownership and parenting.  I wouldn\u2019t leave my son alone with my miniature poodle at that age.", "NTA.  I have to admit, I was ready to crucify you about tearing a specific breed... but I digress.  My boys are 11 & 8 and grew up in a house with 2 dogs who were well trained & adored them.  I would never leave a young child unsupervised with any dog regardless of breed.  Especially, if they are not extremely close to the animal.  Children's behavior can be unpredictable at the best of times and things can go sideways in an instant where they do something an animal can perceive as a threat and they will instinctively move to protect themselves.\n\nMy own dog who worships my oldest (he is hers, and has been since he came home from the hospital, I just feed him). Was wandering around at 2 with a blanket on his head and stepped on her while she was sleeping, despite being repeatedly told to stop and intervening, he stepped on her and she leapt up and started to snap.  Now, she realized it within the moment and pulled her bite, but he still ended up with a gouge in his forehead that required stitches.  But a dog pulling their bite is unusual to say the least and it could have gone so much worse.", "Why the hell would someone bring 3 big dogs to someone elses house?  Thats rude in itself.. they could have put the dogs in a pay kennel for the weekend.. God these dog people irritate me! and NTA.. tell her some more about herself! Like how rude she is to assume that everyone just loves dogs! I dont mind them, but I too am afraid of big dogs and I dont have dogs.. they arent my thing. Famous last words of a dog lover is.. \"He wont bite\".. then someone ends up in the ER and the one that got bit gets blamed.", "NTA. It\u2019s not up to you to train Jenny\u2019s dogs at a family party. Everything she asked of you, especially offering to have her dogs watch over your toddler, was ridiculous. Jenny\u2019s insult about children being untrained brats was uncalled for. I love dogs, but any animal can be unpredictable, especially two new dogs who are in a different environment. It sounds like poor Jenny sees her dogs as an extension of herself, and when everyone didn\u2019t swoon over her new pets, her feelings were hurt.", "NTA. I don't think children should be left alone with animals in most cases. I grew up with the sweetest, teddy bear of a Labrador who would never ever have hurt anyone. That was until a family friends kid poured sand straight into his face. He bit the heck out of that kids face and it all happened so fast. This was with a whole group of people there and it was lit too fast for anyone to react fast enough. I had stood up to intervene when he poured sand on the dog but the dog bit before I could reach them. I was shocked because I was honestly just going to save my dog from the kid. It's not really about personal feelings towards dogs. Animals sometimes just have to communicate with their teeth, claws, hooves and kids are not able to avoid these situations at times.", "NTA.  I have kids and dogs.  You child isn't used to dogs and you don't know these dogs and how they react around kids.  Your SIL is getting offended for no reason.  Should an apology be made? Yes, but from her, not you.  She sounds ridiculous.  If you apologize and placate her it will only justify her inappropriate position even more.", "NTA Children under five should never be allowed near any breed of dog unsupervised, even five might push it for some children. I love dogs to bits, and because of that, I know they can be unsafe around very young children. Not because the dog is being mean, but accidents happen and even a little wobbly fall can hurt a kid so young.  \n\n\nYou do need to be harder on him for pulling at your cat's tail. This isn't okay and it's not harmless even if your cat doesn't react. A cat's tail is part of their spine and is filled with very important nerves.", ">regardless of size or breed\n\nya sure, but the risk of your child getting severely injured or killed when left alone with two bloodsport dogs like XL bullies is significantly higher than if you left them alone with two chihuahuas, or two poodles, or two beagles, or two golden retrievers..", "Breed or not, it's irresponsible to leave your child with any dog. UK resident here, someone who graduated from a dog grooming academy and worked with a variety of dog while learning the biology and behaviour of dogs along their breed purposes and history. Your SIL doesn't realise that with any dog, you wouldn't keep it with any dog, I witnessed dogs such as cocker poos go from friendly dog to once annoyed they will bite a grown adult.\n\nAlso, using a child to prove a point ensures she hasn't considered the danger of any animal being understandably upset with a 2 year old grabbing them and gripping whatever. It's better for the dogs and child to be likely introduced slowly, carefully as dogs can be unpredictable a wagging tail isn't always a sign of a happy dog as I have learned (been bit by dogs who get anxious and aggressive, not calling the breed in the post that for clarification).", "Toddlers will try anything a few times. A tail is fun, it moves and it's soft to touch etc. It's normal for them to attempt it ahe have to be told off\n\nThey don't realise it hurts the cats \n\nIt's similar to how you have to teach toddlers not to bite, or touch hot things or run out into the road"]}
