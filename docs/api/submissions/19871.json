The pandemic was very difficult for a lot of people, and I don\u2019t know how if may come across as I type this, but I can confidently say my parents were never in any financial danger.

It sounds like they do have a slight preference towards him, but I also wonder if they are not considering your needs because you're 18 while bro is still a 'minor'.\n\nAs others have said, your brother isn't at fault here and it's good to hear you get that. \n\nIn the end your parent's will do what they want and they aren't legally required to take care of you anymore. \n\nI'd consider telling brother what's going on and see what he thinks about it. If he also thinks it's unfair, he can help pressure your parents. But a caution - your parents may cut off his insurance/financial support if they don't like him standing up for you (punishing you by punishing him) or if they agree but can't afford to support both of you - so no one gets it.", "Is there anyone else in outside of you family that can teach you to drive?

The pandemic is over. If they say no ask them why not.", "I don\u2019t mean to mock them, but maybe they took it that way. I think them offering up insurance and lessons so easily to my brother just ticked me to wrong way because they aren\u2019t the type of people to offer if they can\u2019t deliver. Which gets me thinking, if they could\u2019ve afforded to put me on insurance, why wouldn\u2019t they tell me? I would\u2019ve gotten my permit again earlier, and maybe it would\u2019ve helped me get a job", "They asked me about that, and apparently in california the limit is one year, unfortunately for me i\u2019m a couple months too late, so I have to retake the test", "I don\u2019t have any family nearby who I could rely on unfortunately. The only person who would come to mind to help would be a family friend who I\u2019m close with, but she\u2019s so busy with work that If I could get her to teach me it would be inconsistent and short (she\u2019s also a little\u2026 controlling, it would be stressful) I\u2019m willing to do it though, if the conversation I need to have with my parents goes like this one did", "Maybe you should talk to them about it."]}
