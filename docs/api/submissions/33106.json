My supply has been dropping due to my stress at work so I\u2019ve been discouraged from pumping. \n\nToday I went to speak with my husband about the topic. I stated that I was struggling and I was considering stopping. He got progressively angrier as the conversation went on.

It sounds like there's a lot going on contributing to your stress and feeling down, and maybe a qualified professional could help you work through that in a way that allows you some personal agency.\n\nYour wellbeing matters, along with that of your child's, and at the point where breast feeding (pumping) is impacting your wellbeing, you need people on your team to help you brainstorm solutions, not guilt you, shame you, or threaten you.\n\nI'm so sorry this is how your husband reacted. \n\nCould you consult with your dr to see if they can help provide recommendations for you (what formulas on the market are good, etc) and help provide literature so you can come into this conversation with your husband in a way that is factual and informed so he can't simply fly off the handle and make rogue accusations like he did?", "Nta and he's red flags", "W T F.

My pediatrician told me there is a diminishing rate of return on breastfeeding after 6 months anyway Your husband really doesn't get a say when he isn't the one doing it.", "So your husband is an obstetrician?  One that can't be reasoned with?  One who doesn't give a hot buttered shit about your emotional well being?

Breastfeeding is taxing on the body, physically and emotionally, and having to constantly pump sucks. It\u2019s your body and your choice. If he wants to divorce you for that (though I presume that\u2019s a bluff / scare tactic) let him. If you need to talk feel free to reach out to me, as someone who dealt with a controlling husband for nearly a decade.

He can have an opinion but until he grows, nurtures and produces sustenance for a child he does not get to judge. His hostility here and his derision - there is NO place for that kind of an attitude. He owes you a MASSIVE apology and he needs a serious reality check. Breast feeding and pumping takes a lot of energy. It takes time. Two things he will never understand but he can at least try to empathize. His total and complete lack of empathy is truly concerning here and it makes me worried about whether he is manipulative and threatening in other situations with you. \n\nThird, formula is expensive. Before you quit pumping all together, calculate out how much formula will cost over the next 6 months. Can you pump some and supplement with formula as opposed to wholly switching over?  Just something to think about since you guys are so young and I'm guessing neither of you are high wage earners.\n\nNo matter what, you need to do what is best for your health and wellbeing.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants the baby breastfed, he can take Prolactin\u00a0and nurse the baby himself.\n\nDivorce over this?

Is he going to let your baby starve because you can't produce more?", "NTA but baaaabbyyyyy the divorce papers should be printed and handed to him tomorrow. Your child is close to transitioning to solid foods, what is he gonna ask you to grow the fruits and veggies exclusively to make baby food next?\n\nFormula is made as a substitute for those who can\u2019t breastfeed/don\u2019t produce enough.

I did it with my twins for 6 months and then I went crazy! lol!", "NTA I hated breastfeeding so much, it is very difficult physically and psychologically. Do what is right for your health and sanity.

I am saying this entirely from experience. \n\nI switched to formula around 5 months as well, and I have a happy and healthy 4 year old. \n\nMy biggest concern is your husband\u2019s horrible response to this situation\u2026 others have chimed in enough about this but I\u2019ll just say \u2026 a less stressed mom is far more beneficial than the breastmilk. \n\n(Also get your husband to read cribsheet - and educate himself about breastmilk vs formula.
