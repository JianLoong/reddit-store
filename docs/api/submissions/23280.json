The contradictions are enormous! The Ten Commandments? Different story. Gods rules as far as we know\u2026 ? That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to think anyway.\nBut as for the bible saying that being gay is a sin.. it also says wearing more than one type of material is a sin.. and owning slaves from your own town is a sin - but slaves from neighbouring towns is fine? Eating shellfish? SIN oh and god is a loving God, we are all his children, loves us all equally etc\u2026 BUT God is a wrathful, jealous and vengeful God too? It stands to reason that many things in the \u201cword of God\u201d was subbed out for the opinion of the author.  Majority of the lgbtq community would\u2019ve preferred to be attracted to the opposite sex, when they first realised.. it CANT be wrong when so many are born with a proclivity to desire the same sex.  You can still love God without following the bible relentlessly! \nI will say this to those who are anti God, (how could he let kids die etc) I had the same exact feelings about blindly following someone who allowed such suffering.  I gave Him some slack after someone said to me that God doesn\u2019t have the ability to stop all the evil works of the DEVIL. It\u2019s him making these children suffer and all these awful things happen. Not God.
