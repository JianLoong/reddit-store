It\u2019s black, with the name Barbie in pink with a fancy font.\n\nMy son loves it. He\u2019s only 3 and doesn\u2019t know what it says. He only likes it because we were looking through the basement in my parents house and came across the hat and a photo of me wearing it when I was younger. He got super excited when he saw the picture and has been in love with the hat ever since. \n\nHe calls it the \u201cmama hat,\u201d everyone thinks it\u2019s cute. \n\nWe were having dinner with my SIL and her family. My SIL has an 8 year old daughter who I love. She really likes Barbie and everything she owns is Barbie themed.\n\nI had a feeling that maybe it wouldn\u2019t be best for my son to wear the Barbie hat while we were there but he really wanted to show his uncle (aka his best buddy) and my husband said it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal so I allowed it. \n\nThe night went pretty well but I noticed my SIL was a little quiet. Right before we left, she pulled me aside and asked if I could do her a big favour. \n\nShe asked if I could sell her the Barbie hat. I asked her why she wanted the hat and she said that her daughter\u2019s been eyeing it all night and asked for one. I told her to just buy one online or something but she said that she feels like that would be a waste.\n\nI said I was sorry but I wasn\u2019t giving her the hat. She argued that my son is a boy and once he realizes it\u2018s Barbie themed, he\u2019ll throw it away. I explained to her that she can ask for it again when the time comes and I\u2019ll think about it.\n\nI thought that was it but she went to my son directly and starting telling him how Barbie\u2019s for girls and that the hat is Barbie. He got upset because to him it\u2019s not Barbie hat, it\u2019s mama hat. \n\nI was over it though and told her that she definitely wasn\u2019t getting it ever now. That if he decides he doesn\u2019t want it anymore, it\u2019s going straight to the garbage or my mom\u2019s basement again. She got all frustrated and said that I\u2019m being absolutely ridiculous. She accused me of being a childish asshole and said that I just broke her daughter\u2019s heart. AITA? I\u2019m starting to feel a little bad. I think I might be doing a little too much over a silly old hat.", "created_utc": 1676318551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111igiz/aita_for_refusing_to_ever_sell_a_barbie_baseball/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your SIL asked you, which is reasonable, then tried to use outdated gender stereotypes to get her way, which is not cool, then openly tried to manipulate your THREE YEAR OLD SON, both introducing toxic gender ideas and upsetting him needlessly, which is either dreadful.

Her behavior** about all of this was totally unacceptable.  **She wanted something that belonged to someone else, and tried to get it by being a cruel bully to a child.**  Then she tried to manipulate you, the parent, again, by blaming you, falsely accusing you and trying to get her wants again.  She refused to accept your decision when you first gave it to her.   **This is a very selfish person, who doesn't see that what she did to your child was nasty and cruel.**  She just broke any trust you might have had with her, by doing this to your child.

That's what really got me. She purposefully upset a small child AND tried to then guilt you. You didn't break your niece's heart. I'm sure by the time she got home she found something else she wanted. \n\nThat hat has more meaning for you and your son then it will ever have for your niece because I'd guess in another couple of years she's not going to even like Barbie since it's won't be \"cool\" anymore, but you'll have your hat and your son, even if he doesn't want to wear the hat, will have those memories.", "NTA at all.

And, no, she didn\u2019t \u201ctalk\u201d to your son, she bullied him. NTA", "NTA. Fuck that. I'd go no contact altogether after she pulled that stunt.", "She upset your son just so her daughter can have the hat. No. Hell, no. You tell your sweet boy to wear the Mama Hat with pride and sometimes adults are wrong and this time his auntie was.\n\nNTA do not feel bad. she was manipulating a child because she's too cheap to buy her own kid a hat.", "NTA - just Google \"black barbie hat\" and you can buy them online so SIL needs to figure out how to use her resources over trying to take away from a literal child", "NTA. Exactly as you said, he'll stop wearing it when he wants to. I'm also at a point in my life where I don't like the idea of Gender stereotypes, especially at such a young age where kids don't know any better, so for her to say that he can't wear the hat cuz \"Barbie is for girls\" is just stupid", "NTA - silly hat?  It wasn't too silly for the SIL to try and exert pressure on a 3 year old boy to get it, was it?  OP, teach your son to make sure he never wears it to their house again, so that it won't get disappeared.", "NTA. A kids heart doesn't break when they see something, want it but don't get it. they may get mad especially if they are spoiled but that's hardly a reason to \"break their heart\". If I ever said that I would feel extremely stupid.\n\nI just don't understand parents these days. Just because your kid wants something doesn't mean they should get it. Looks like she's gonna raise your niece to be extremely entitled.", "NTA. If it was just a \"silly old hat\", she wouldn't have tried to coerce a 3 year old into giving to her. She can buy one for her kid. The world doesn't revolve around her kid. And pushing gender roles on a 3 year old is disgusting.", "So u not giving your entitled SIL the hat for her daughter has broken said daughters heart(emotional  blackmail much) . What the hell does she think taking it off your son is gonna do to his little heart. Some people don't half boil my piss. Absolutely NTA tell her to jog on.", "F her daughters heart.", "NTA but if your son ever grows out it and doesn't want it anymore I'd send it in an envelope cut up in pieces", "NTA, and this isn\u2019t really about a hat.  It was a power play on her part to bully your son when you said no.  THAT\u2019S the hill you die on.", "Literally just Googled \"barbie baseball cap\" and there are easy options out there. If this was really about SIL wanting a similar hat for her daughter, it's easy enough to get her own.", "Trying to confuse a toddler into giving up something he loves!!! And making it about gender, too. The poor little guy has probably never even heard of Barbie. He obviously just loves the hat because it's his mom's.\n\nSexist AH all day long.", "Not only that, but why is Barbie a \"girl\" toy in this day and age? I didn't realize one needed a vagina to play with Barbie. \n\nOP's right, the hat isn't a Barbie hat, it's a hat she wore that *her* child wants to wear.", "She tried to manipulate a three year old, so she could steal from him. TF?!!", "Save the hat and the picture. And one of son wearing it also. For next generation. Priceless", ">Wait, she tried to guilt your 3 year old son in giving up the hat because it is for girls. \n\nAnd then she even had the audacity to say OP broke her daughter's heart!", "Yep - she just didn't want to pay for one.\n\nNTA", "\"You broke my daughter's heart.\" Yeah, well, you crushed my sons heart. I guess we're even? SIL sounds like a selfish (and, you're right, sexist) jerk.", "You should see what happens when SIL finds a baby with candy.", "OP you should absolutely do this, it\u2019s a new family heirloom!", "Also, please don\u2019t let anyone tell your son that Barbie is only for girls.", "She didn\u2019t give the SIL permission and she didn\u2019t know the SIL was going to do that."]}
