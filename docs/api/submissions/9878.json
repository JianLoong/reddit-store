It\u2019s black, with the name Barbie in pink with a fancy font.\n\nMy son loves it. He\u2019s only 3 and doesn\u2019t know what it says. He only likes it because we were looking through the basement in my parents house and came across the hat and a photo of me wearing it when I was younger. He got super excited when he saw the picture and has been in love with the hat ever since. \n\nHe calls it the \u201cmama hat,\u201d everyone thinks it\u2019s cute. \n\nWe were having dinner with my SIL and her family. My SIL has an 8 year old daughter who I love. She really likes Barbie and everything she owns is Barbie themed.\n\nI had a feeling that maybe it wouldn\u2019t be best for my son to wear the Barbie hat while we were there but he really wanted to show his uncle (aka his best buddy) and my husband said it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal so I allowed it. \n\nThe night went pretty well but I noticed my SIL was a little quiet. Right before we left, she pulled me aside and asked if I could do her a big favour. \n\nShe asked if I could sell her the Barbie hat. I asked her why she wanted the hat and she said that her daughter\u2019s been eyeing it all night and asked for one. I told her to just buy one online or something but she said that she feels like that would be a waste.\n\nI said I was sorry but I wasn\u2019t giving her the hat. She argued that my son is a boy and once he realizes it\u2018s Barbie themed, he\u2019ll throw it away. I explained to her that she can ask for it again when the time comes and I\u2019ll think about it.\n\nI thought that was it but she went to my son directly and starting telling him how Barbie\u2019s for girls and that the hat is Barbie. He got upset because to him it\u2019s not Barbie hat, it\u2019s mama hat. \n\nI was over it though and told her that she definitely wasn\u2019t getting it ever now. That if he decides he doesn\u2019t want it anymore, it\u2019s going straight to the garbage or my mom\u2019s basement again. She got all frustrated and said that I\u2019m being absolutely ridiculous. She accused me of being a childish asshole and said that I just broke her daughter\u2019s heart. AITA? I\u2019m starting to feel a little bad.

Your SIL asked you, which is reasonable, then tried to use outdated gender stereotypes to get her way, which is not cool, then openly tried to manipulate your THREE YEAR OLD SON, both introducing toxic gender ideas and upsetting him needlessly, which is dreadful.

Her behavior** about all of this was totally unacceptable.  **She wanted something that belonged to someone else, and tried to get it by being a cruel bully to a child.**  Then she tried to manipulate you, the parent, again, by blaming you, falsely accusing you and trying to get her wants again.  She refused to accept your decision when you first gave it to her.   **This is a very selfish person, who doesn't see that what she did to your child was nasty and cruel.**  She just broke any trust you might have had with her, by doing this to your child.

That's what really got me. She purposefully upset a small child AND tried to then guilt you. You didn't break your niece's heart. I'm sure by the time she got home she found something else she wanted. \n\nThat hat has more meaning for you and your son then it will ever have for your niece because I'd guess in another couple of years she's not going to even like Barbie since it's won't be \"cool\" anymore, but you'll have your hat and your son, even if he doesn't want to wear the hat, will have those memories.", "NTA at all.

On the other hand there is a respected Japanese customer that if someone admires something of yours that you clean it up and present it to them as a gift, noting that you knew they wanted it.  It is a gift of self sacrifice and a demonstration of good character.  Now this is all very good for adults and older children.
