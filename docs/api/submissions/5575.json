I can't say I like this group and therefore, do not want to get kicked out! Also, never said being pagan isn't a type of \"religion\" however, our life style doesn't intrude onto others and we don't go to a Christan party and start preaching about our pagan ways \ud83d\ude0f also, paganism is barely a religion it's literally a \"religion\" based off multiple religions meaning it itself isn't a religion only small parts so it's quite a loose term religion as most of us do this completely and udderly different from each other and none of us practice the same way! We also don't head to every Christan party preaching about what our beliefs nor do we try to force others to do the same thing! I am also not just pagan but I also practice Satanism more so than pagan \ud83d\ude18 (and funny thing I actually have a place of worship satanism \ud83d\ude0f I also have multiple gods and goddesses! I also believe in all Hawaiian gods/goddesses I do not have just one religion I have multiple \ud83d\ude33 \ud83d\ude31", "I truly hope we have the same understanding of things, but I think it is pretty clear that you're still misunderstanding what Christmas means to non-Christians who attend Christmas events with their Christian friends, which is \"nothing at all - but it's entertaining to watch Christians do it and they want to be supportive!\"\n\nYou used non-Christian kids' attendance at your Christmas event as evidence that Christmas is part of their secular culture - which is willfully misunderstanding the meaning of their attendance.\n\nChristmas is very much a holiday of a foreign religion to non-Christians of all stripes, including those who live in diaspora communities in majority Christian areas.  There is no such thing for them as only observing a supposed \"secular\" part of Christmas!  The entirety of the event is religious and foreign, and they are enjoying it as spectators with that framework.\n\nReligious tolerance and a feeling of interfaith brotherhood does not mean that anyone sees your holiday as anything less than a religious occasion specific to your faith - certainly not a secular or merely cultural celebration.", "Wdym stalking? I read the thread and saw your comments in their order. That is why I edited my first reply. If I stalked every religious missionary I saw online I would be very busy and yet accomplishing nothing.\n\nYou do you, but maybe stop doing the same stuff you are judging others for."]}
