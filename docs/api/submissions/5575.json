So I do have some understanding of their nuttery. I also had many friends who were Christian. Who would joke about this, and people who were from the main branches and espoused this idiocy. You're going to have a range of nuttery to just the average Christian  who thinks it's real, and tries to be a good person, and the one mental masturbating about brimstone and fire.", "What in the everloving fuck does \"Tell that to the Jesuits\" mean?", "Preaching one's beliefs is already impolite.", "That's not what I said. I said it's ridiculous to claim that the nationalised festival season in most western nations that is now mostly about presents and Santa solely belongs to Christianity when the numbers of actual practicising Christians in that nation is dwindling. Especially in not America. \n\nHaving been raised in it, having deeply read it's history, I don't think the ownership of tradition has as solid a foundation as people think. People can like and believe in the Jesus story, or not. None of it really matters as long as you're not a dick about it. I live in Australia when if Jesus was actually born on Dec 25 it's the middle of summer yet we still put fake snow everywhere, sing snow themed Christmas songs. It's ridiculous and I love it.", "I don't worship anything at Christmas time actually and I think by 'compromise' you actually mean 'realise they couldn't murder *everybody*'. Look I get what you're saying but capitalism has bow co-opted Christmas and I'd argue that capitalism is the new national religion of most western countries, especially those which large sects of prosperity doctrine Christians.", "I'll stay in the lane of the religion I know most about but will say that people who wish to believe in any of them really need to read the histories of their own faiths and realise how many of the traditions are stolen.", "Then why isn\u2019t he throwing a Saturnalia party? Why a party named after Christ?", "So you've celebrated your birthday ummm MONTHS after? I don't think so!

I get that there are jews who do that and I don't judge- I understand, as a Muslim, how hard it is to see kids especially feel let down that their friends have more excitement (and gifts) around the holidays than they do, and I know some Jewish families embrace Jewish Christmas hannukah as a way to combat that. But i know way more Jewish families who find that an erasure of their culture and traditions, so I would never advocate for it. \n\nAnd yes, my family gets a tree and exchanges gifts around the holidays but that's mostly just convenience and we try very hard not to do it on Christmas day itself. And when people tell me it's not a Christian holiday, I roll my eyes and say yes it is- I grew up agnostic and we didn't do anything religious on our holidays but that didn't make them less a Muslim holiday.", "Y\u2019know, I\u2019ll stack my social science and history credentials against yours any time.

Or was that 40 days?", "Some Christians in the US get really *angry* that non-Christians celebrate Christmas.  They should lobby Congress to change the status of Christmas from a national holiday to just another ordinary work day, because national holidays are for everyone in the nation, to celebrate or not however they wish.", "Contra to the points I made above, I will say that in the former Soviet Union it is common for Jews and Muslims to put up a \u201cNew Year\u2019s Tree.\u201d The custom originated because the Soviet authorities wanted New Years to replace Christmas as the focal point of holiday celebrations. \n\nEven there, though, it\u2019s a New Year\u2019s Tree. They don\u2019t put on ridiculous airs that Muslims and Jews are celebrating Christmas. (I have, in fairness, known some religiously mixed families to celebrate both holidays. But, mixed marriages are, by definition, theologically complicated!)", "Ah, true- good point.", "I know this and apart from being queer it's one of the reasons I left the church. The arrogance is overwhelming.", "Dude Christmas is celebrated in Japan a Shintoist nation and China an state atheist nation both countries view it as a fun novelty holiday and It's fully secular to them.

As the host it\u2019s on you to be the bigger person - she wasn\u2019t being anything but the person you already knew she would be - I get that you don\u2019t like her but you invited her knowing that.

I'm gonna remember that phrase. you made my evening!", "Yep I was also a bit like this, though pretty mild on the spectrum of pushy christians. Everything you said is correct.

Confronting her and standing up for what\u2019s right took courage - OP is NTA.", "Thank you. It seems like most of these people feel like she was less than human, because of her beliefs, and undeserving of kindness. I get that no one wanted to hear what she was talking about, but humiliating her was unnecessary.", "Just who the hell do you think he is!", "It means that Jesuits run a lot of the Catholic universities in America, and trust me, they\u2019re not teaching literal creationism at the Georgetown University biology department.", "So, it\u2019s alright for Christians to laugh at atheists and tell them they are going to hell? No, its not. You can talk to people without laughing or making fun", "The Jesuits are also derided by almost every other Christian sect, including almost all Catholic orders, as being anywhere from misguided to Satanic.", "If an atheist attempted to start converting Christian out of the blue like gf was doing by proselytizing, then yes I would have no problem with the Christians saying to the atheist that they are wrong, going to hell, etc. This is why we don\u2019t discuss religion in polite society. Whoever brings up the subject and shares their beliefs unprompted should expect to be challenged by people who don\u2019t agree with them.", "Yeah the Roman Empire was already a multicultural government that accepted many different religions.

He died of a spear wound. There have been allegations as early as 364 AD that he was assassinated by a christian.   \n\n\nOne of the things Julian did was allow the Jews to rebuild their temple because that would be a direct refutation of J's prophecy about its destruction.

OP went in with preconceived notions of his cousins gf. They call her insane which is unkind.

The amount of Christan friends I have would never behave this way in my home the most they would do is pray at dinner and I completely accept that and I'll still listen quietly without eating in my own house for them! I also would never go to their house and disrespect them either. I'll actually bow my head and say aman and listen to them read from the Bible. Usually, they thank me for respecting their traditions and there really isn't any thanks to give as I respect those who respect me and they know I think it's stupid, but I'll never disrespect them even in my own home as long as they don't me ya know", "It's also and was first a pagan holiday so there's that! And no I know many people under 30 including my own family and my friends kids who believe in the Christan god and I don't think I caught that actually", "I agree with you \ud83d\udcaf. A huge part of the onus falls back onto the gf\u2019s parents for not teaching her more patiences and respectful of others beliefs.", "Definitely! I wish more Christians were like the Christians I am friends with because I would never hate religion if this was the case! It's people who make other disrespect religions not the religion itself!"]}
