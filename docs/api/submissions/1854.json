Are you being asked to help?", "NTA - but this isn\u2019t just about yard work.  This is about your 29 yr old partner prioritizing his family of origin over his partner and himself. When you become an adult, and move out on your own, the remaining adult family members are responsible for maintaining their house.  The now adult, moved out on his own son, is responsible for his own place.\n\nHe is acting like a sonsband to his mother.  Even though he has moved out on his own, he is doing the work that a husband would do.  But he is not their husband and father.  If they are going to live on their own, they need to be self sufficient without his help.  He can advise, like if there is a problem with their cars, recommend a mechanic\u2026\n\nHis hostile reaction to your legitimate comment that the 25 yr olds can do yard work, is very telling.  It means that he is emotionally invested in being a sonsband and father to his family of origin.\n\nIt\u2019s means that he was not ready to move out on his own because he is too invested in being the man of the house at their house.\n\nThe questions that you need to ask him are\u2026\nDoes he do these things because he wants to take care of them? Or does he do these things because he thinks he has to?\nWhy does he object to his sisters doing work at their house that you do at yours?\nDoes he want to get them more self sufficient so that he doesn\u2019t have to go?  If he doesn\u2019t, is he planning to do this forever?  Does he realize how that would affect him being with you? What if you have kids?? He wouldn\u2019t have time to manage both households, has he thought about that?\n\nThe answers to these questions should give you food for thought on where you think this relationship is going\u2026", "info:\n\nWhy you dont take your baby and run?\n\nSounds like for him his sister is more important for him than you. \nI think it will crash anyway.", "NTA I don't think it's rude to expect able bodied people to help around the house if they are there. Seems like there might be something else going on that may have triggered him to lash out. Is he also expected to do chores for your brother and that's what bothered him? Or are we missing something?", "NTA\n\nHe needs to take a stand. If there are people that are fully capable of completing the tasks who actually live there, they need to be stepping up to do it. My parents shared a 2 family with my father's brother and family. Growing up, I was forced... FORCED to go out and help shovel snow (we had two snow blowers) while all the females (including teen girls) were permitted to stay inside. I finally took a stand when I moved out and my aunt had the balls to call me and ask me when I'd be over to \"help the guys clear snow\".  The idea was that \"yard work is for men\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBottom line, if his sisters are able to rake, then they had better be out there helping if your husband, who doesn't live there, is over helping.", "Idk, I have steadfastly refused to do yard work at every age. I guess technically I\u2019m fully capable lol but it ain\u2019t gonna happen. The leaves can bury my goddamn house idgaf you will never catch me with a rake \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. It sounds to me that your husband is valuing his sisters and mom above you. You did not deserve to be berated for suggesting his sisters help, and obviously your brother has nothing to do with HIS family.", "Nta, but he has some serious issues.   Are you sure you want to sign up for a lifetime of this?", "NTA\n\nHe is gaslighting you. Most people would have a problem with his relatives.", "NTA but the real question is what are you going to do with him? He seems manipulative to me and willing to emotionally browbeat you into letting him have his way. He doesn't sound like a partner and I think you're going to have a very serious talk with him and potentially get into counseling because this sounds like an unhealthy relationship as it is.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t suggesting they do it themselves, I\u2019m not sure why he took offense at the idea that they assist? The only thing that I can think of is there has been some weird conditioning in his upbringing that there a \u201cboy chores\u201d and \u201cgirl chores\u201d - but that doesn\u2019t explain why he\u2019s happy to let you do those chores at home, or he has been conditioned that his sister\u2019s wants/needs/convenience comes first. Final possibility is he just really has skewed priorities, but lashing out at you is way out of line based on what you\u2019ve described. \n\nAre his sister\u2019s favored by his parents/is there a chance that he\u2019s the scape goat? What happens when he does say no to them (if he ever has)? Those two questions will be really telling if this is exclusively a relationship/him problem, or a conditioned problem which is affecting your relationship. If it\u2019s the latter individual therapy can help him learn to set healthy boundaries with them, manage their expectation etc, but if the former couples therapy might be the only chance of changing/getting to the root of the issue. \n\nEither way though, both situations are both negatively impacting you and aren\u2019t fair to you or your child. This issue isn\u2019t going to resolve itself, and arguing/disagreeing with him hasn\u2019t made any impact/changes. You need to take a critical look at your relationship and try to view your relationship through the eye of it happening to your child or best friend, as happening to someone you care deeply about. Then there\u2019s two really hard questions - would you be okay/comfortable with hearing about it happening to them (and yes, every relationship has issues, but would you worry if what\u2019s happening in your relationship was happening in theirs), and if you would be worried, angry, disgusted, or any other strong negative reaction, why have you been okay in your relationship but wouldn\u2019t be okay with it in your child/best friends relationship? \n\nIt\u2019s can be really confronting and painful sometimes, and to be clear it doesn\u2019t mean a relationship is over, it just highlights problems that need fixing, and hopefully motivates action to be taken to change those things. Sometimes they can and are fixed, sometimes they can\u2019t, which then prompts the last question - am I prepared to spend the rest of my life with this status quo and have it be an example to my child/ren?", "NTA. OP look up DARVO. He's being manipulative. He knows that you're not trying to keep his family from your baby, your brother had nothing to do with the situation, and being reactive means that you're put on the defensive and the heat is off of his actions. If he has an issue, it can be discussed after the current issue you're discussing. \n\n\"His family\" are you and your child *and* his mother and sisters, but when you grow up and move out and settle down, your other half and children become your main priority. Ditching family and responsibilities to save his sisters from doing yard work is bs.\n\nFind a counselor who understands abusive relationships. Not saying that you're necessarily in one, but the tactics he's using are a special kind of manipulative and regular counselors and therapists aren't actually trained to recognize and handle those kinds of tactics. Those trained in abusive relationships will see through it and help you navigate it in a healthy way. And they can do all the stuff regular counselors can. You don't want to be in a session where they're focused on why you made him angry instead of how he's handling his emotions and communicating them and checking his entitlement. He can disagree and still be respectful, and you shouldn't have to feel like you're walking on eggshells.", "NTA you are absolutely correct to tell him that his family members are fully capable of doing thier own yard work. Gasps they are even capable of taking thier own cars to a mechanic( something your partner isn't) to look it over.", "NTA.\n\nUnless they have disabilities they haven't told you about out of embarrassment or something, his reaction seems like a massive overreaction to two words and is either a sign that there is something you don't know about so he is being protective... or it is a red flag and he is flying off the handle over something innocent just to knock you off balance (abusers do this to create confusion).\n\nYou need to talk with him and he needs to clear up **now** why he reacted like you were insulting his sisters by thinking them to be adults that can do stuff on their own.\n\nAnd honestly, why he keeps going there to do things they should be able to do on their own. If they don't know how to set up mouse traps, they can learn - internet tutorials exist for a lot of stuff. His sisters are old enough they shouldn't be depending on him to drive 20 minutes to do basic small chores that they can do themselves if they want to.\n\nDoes he want them to be dependent on him? Does he get validation from this? Because none of these sound like big tasks (like moving or a whole house clean) where family outside the home would typically help (except the car one, but he knows nothing about cars, so it is useless to really ask him to do this instead of a mechanic or someone else that does know cars).", "YTA. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t your place to say anything. He didn\u2019t even ask for your help and you still felt the need to comment on his family \n\nMy partner doesn\u2019t comment on my family dynamics and I don\u2019t comment on theirs. Whatever dysfunctional stuff goes on\u2026.. not my place to say something about a dynamic that has been going on for 20 + years\n\nIf he is shirking his responsibilities at home then that\u2019s the correct convo to have. Not bringing his sisters into the conversation. That\u2019s for him to figure out how to manage time both places.", "Gotta be way more history behind this if he's just snapped over that one part. INFO: What's the deal here with his family?", "NTA\n\nHe suggested your brother should work for his sister so she can do nothing?", "YTA  A mild one. It **may** be that females are not expected to do these type of chores in his family. This is his family, and his business. He is an adult, and fully capable of requesting that they assist, or he could refuse to do these things. His choosing to do these things is not terrible, there are a lot worse things he could be doing in his free time.\n\nI don't know why he got so angry, unless you harp on this issue frequently? Perhaps you could ask how exactly you disrespected his family that it certainly wasn't your intention.", "You\u2019re both TA. His feelings of his family being disrespected is totally valid. Whether you meant to or not, your tone probably came off as snarky to him. Even if it\u2019s true, it was offhanded. However, it was just as disrespectful for him to bring your brother up as a retort.\n\nMaybe he just enjoys doing these tasks for his mom, whether or not his sisters help.", "NTA\n\nYour partner is wrong.   You're right.   His sisters are fully capable of doing the things he's going over to do.   The fact your brother is also lazy for whatever reason has nothing to do with it.", "You sound like a INLTOG. Maybe he likes to do nice things for his family.

He may be a push-over but that's what he wants to be. You have to decide if you can live with that because I'm guessing it's not going to change. You're resenting the time he spends over there but that's a waste of time because it's going to keep happening. His view of you having a problem with his family is probably based on previous conversations where you've told him he doesn't need to do everything for them. I think he needs to be more aware of how his going over there all the time affects you. It's frustrating to think your family together is not his priority.  There's a lack of respect on both sides.

So don't do that in the future?", "You have an SO problem.\n\nHe seems to forget he promised to 'leave' his family and 'cleave' to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "LOL if I told my brothers to come over and help me do yard work, they'd be like, are you paying us? No? Then why don't you hire someone to do it for you if you're too lazy to do it yourself?\n\nNote: I hire someone to do it for me, I don't call my brothers to help me with stuff that I can either do myself or afford to pay someone to come do for me.", "You don't have a problem with his family. The problem is with your husband.", ">There are literally no boundaries. He spreads himself thin and then lashes out on me.\n\nJust pointing out that the most likely time for **domestic violence** to start is during pregnancy.\n\nThe second most likely time is just after the baby is born.\n\nStay safe OP.", "Are you sure is a person you want to be with forever? He seems to have. Erm. Interesting views on genders.", "INFO: Where is their father? If he's not in the picture, what were the circumstances of him leaving? How old was your husband when he became the man of (his mom's) house?\n\nI actually think your 15 year old brother being brought up is a relevant clue towards better understanding what's really going on, for multiple reasons. Knowing the answers to my questions could help me see an underlying cause.", "You have a partner  problem  and you need to solve it asap. \n\n1. To get it it out of the way : your brother  while lazy is still  a teen and your parents  (I assume) don't ask you to come  rake the leaves, right? If that's  the case your brother's  laziness  is irrelevant  in this case \n\n2.  Counseling  urgently  to get your  partner  to understand  that the priority  is his family  =now you and the baby are that, mom and sisters  take 2nd place  unless  it's  an emergency. \n\n3. The lashing  out needs to stop : anger management  or something  as it's  not ok to traumatize you over nothing. \n\nIf needed  to get 2 &3  go live with your parents  for a while  and if nothing  works  then the last solution  is to break  up  for your  mental health. \nThe lashing  out is verbal  abuse. \n\n\nNta\n\nBTW  I agree  that the sisters  are able to do the raking  alone , it's  not  that complicated.", "NTA- my m.i.l use to make my hubby do d.i.y whilst having 3 capable men in her home. (We lived in a different city and our short stays wer overtaken by her list of demands) It doesn't bother me now but at the time I use hate it. I can't see why his sisters can't help clean their own garden up. Also your husband needs to realise that you can't drop all your plans to please his sister. I think your being reasonable when you said his sister could come the day after. In my experience the only thing that works is when they experience the same thing first hand. Like him having to drop his plans last minute.", "Your husband is the problem. Not his siblings. Take your baby and run. This wont end well.", "So he goes to his family\u2019s home to do tasks he deems his adult sisters incapable of while you complete the exact same things in your own home? Nta. Tell him to stop coddling his sisters or they\u2019ll never grow up and learn to do for themselves.", "Idk sounds like there may be a deeper problem, he either has resentment for you for some reason or he's smashing one of his sisters (weird, I know but ppl be weird out here). Or his sister has health problems.", "Info, please\u2026. Is his father in the picture?  Because it sounds to me as though he\u2019s been branded as \u2018the man of the house\u2019 for his mom & sisters and it seems to be deeply a part of his identity.", "Is it that this guy sees you as just a breeder for his family or what\ud83d\ude2d Like damn, Vin Deisel  You're NTA btw", "you are his side family lol, NTA", "Your edit screams red flags \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "You know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions!", "NTA. But you buried the lead. His mom's lack of boundaries indicate that there's probably a lot more going on. I've literally never encountered someone who had a lack of boundaries and zero other issues.", "Maybe you should start having him does everything as well at your home and see him spouting the double standard", "Support him. Not his family, not his mistake in not prioritizing his wife and child, but him as a person. He is probably kind and generous and helpful, he needs for the first time to realize he has to redirect his energies away from his family of origin. Tell him you\u2019re on his side, it\u2019s difficult, he\u2019s going through a process and you know he\u2019ll manage, but you\u2019re not the enemy. Ask for some time to talk about it calmly, and approach it as \u201cso many hours in a day\u201d. Remind him of real examples of your care and concern for his family, but you can\u2019t and won\u2019t have your time dictated to by them. Set up regular time to visit with them (on your schedule, both at home and out of your home), ask him what he thinks is reasonable. Let him know he\u2019s making you, his wife and partner, feel badly about things that you are innocent of. He\u2019s probably feeling a lot of guilt (unfair: Guilt is for bad things we do on purpose) from them, they\u2019re probably spoiled by his attention and don\u2019t want to give it up - so give him positive reinforcement and verbalize compliments on his good attentive husband and father qualities. He\u2019s making it seem like you\u2019re trying to control him, when in fact THEY are. He needs time to see this for himself.\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t help after a few weeks def try counseling, on your own or with him - don\u2019t insist immediately on couples counseling it\u2019ll be seen as a control issue.", "I wonder if given the dad isn't mentioned there is some trauma background. Maybe OP's husband feels that he is the man of the house and needs to protect them?", "This sounds like a make or break for you. Is it? Because you need to decide what happens next.. are you going to tolerate him abandoning his wife and child at the whim of people who clearly don't like you (he's projecting you don't like them probably because he hears stuff you haven't yet) and have no respect for you and your husband as a family unit? \n\nMy brother is out there somewhere living his life and I sure as hell wouldn't stop to interrupt that so he could rake my damn leaves."]}
