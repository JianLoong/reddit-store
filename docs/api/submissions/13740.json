I would not stay in the relationship.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. You're helping her as much as you can. Unfortunately if someone is unwilling to get help for their situation when it is available to them, there comes a point where you have to do what's best for you. You shouldn't feel guilty for that. If she has your help and support, access to therapy or other forms of support - the ball is in her court. It's not just one person in the relationship.", "NTA. Ditch her.

It's not your responsibility to babysit her every second of the day and make sure she feeds herself. If she won't take any steps to help herself, there's only so much you can do, and you've done it, and more.", "Nta\n\nI have depression and it went untreated for a long time. It placed a huge burden on the people around me. Now that I'm on meds, I see how difficult I was, and feel really bad for the people around me. You can only do so much for someone that doesn't want to help themself.", "NTA\n\nbc you are young and it is not your job to treat her. she needs help and that's clear. you do need to prioritize your own mental health. \n\nit is hard to be with someone with depression but harder if she will not do anything to help herself at all. consider taking space. it's not necessarily a bad thing, sometimes you need to let go a little to just let something even out itself. your support may make her think she is coping when it is clear she is not. \n\ncould you stay with a friend for a while?", "As someone who has diagnosed depression and a partner who has diagnosed depression, no one gets better until they want to. I'm not going to pass judgement, but if you've encouraged her to get help and she won't there is nothing you can individually do to fix it.", "So decide if you want to live like this.\nThen tell herif she won't get therapy it's over.", "NAH\nMy only concern at this point is that you may be inadvertently enabling her. When she's in such a dark place she can't see that she's capable of doing anything for herself,  so you do it for her. For short periods,  this is incredibly sweet and helpful.  But then it becomes an unhealthy pattern where they don't even try to do basic things for themselves because even those around them have accepted they can't.  \nI have no suggestions since each situation is different,  but it may be time to get her to take some responsibility for herself.  She may actually feel good about herself for accomplishing something on her own. This has been my experience.  It seems counterintuitive,  but eventually it's necessary.  \nAbove all, I would suggest that you find yourself support and a counselor to talk these things through with.  You can't make her get help, but a counselor could help you more than you could imagine.  It's the only way I survived and was able to actually be helpful to my depressed loved ones. \nTake care and be kind to yourself!", "A long time ago I had a partner say it to me like this: *I love you so much, but I have run out of ideas on how to support you and help you be happier with yourself and in life, and I think we should enlist professional help.

It'd be above most people's. \n\nI'm sorry she has depression, but it's her job to address it, not yours. If she won't, you are not obligated to stay with her. I know it's difficult to leave someone when they're in bad shape, whatever the reason, but you don't owe her this. She owes herself the attempt to get diagnosis and treatment.", "NTA You can't help her until she helps herself.", "I\u2019ve had depression and other MH issues too so I understand her pain but if she refuses to do anything about it, that\u2019s not fair on you.

Right now, you are a full time baby sitter because she won't work on her shit. NTA, and it's time for you to set some boundaries.", "You are wasting your time and your life", "NTA.  You ARE wasting your time trying to be in a relationship with someone who isn't available to be in one because of her untreated depression.", "I'm kind of missing info, like what is it exactly what you feel like you're an AH for? \nFrom what I interpreted, you try to help her, but it's hard. Mental illnesses and other disorders are hard for both the person who has them and their loved ones, as tgey hate to see them that way.\nThe pandemic got lots of people down, many people's mental health worsened. Therebare two thing that could help with situations like these : therapy and going out, like not working/studying from home, at least going to a library or smth like that to do the work. Sadly, it's hard for most people to even start doing these, it's terrifying and exhausting. \nYou could try to like get her to do her schoolwork with you in a library at weekends, but it's no guarantee it would work or she would even try. Sadly, you have to wait until she realizes she needs help or when she has enough energy to try.\nBut you should definitely should try soeaking about this with her a lot, try to helo her through words. \nTge pandemic made my mental health worse by a lot (it was bad before, but then was when I hit rock bottom) My parents and bf only got through to me by talking, and then was when I started trying.", "NAH. Depression isn't easy for the person who has it, nor for the people who care about them. It sounds like you're both trying your best. I wish your gf would see a therapist, but sometimes self-care, such as getting outside help, can feel overwhelming for someone who's in a bad mental state.", "NTA.

Until she herself wants to seek treatment this will continue. I suggest you give each other some space", "NTA. If she is depressed, it is her responsibility to get help for it. \n\nYou are clearly burnt out and building resentment towards her, which is completely understandable. You have your own needs and wants which are being neglected, that is not healthy or sustainable. \n\nIt may be in your best interest to end the relationship, or at the very least get some space. Otherwise you\u2019ll continue to suffocate.", "As much as I have sympathy for people with depression, I\u2019m just so over seeing everyone use their mental health as excuses to be jerks or lazy. I agree, NTA, ditch the girlfriend, the pandemic started three years ago and the world has been living fairly normal for two years. She\u2019s just being lazy and hopes you\u2019ll be her meal ticket so she can stay home. She refuses help, stop catering to her.", "The pandemic really shattered a lot people's mental health. Most are still recovering from that, there is no reason it could be funny.", "It\u2019s really not funny. The pandemic truly affected millions of people in different ways to different extremes. People lost loved ones, their ability to leave their homes and feel safe for a number of reasons, it caused a lot of people to rethink life and priorities and their purpose, extraverts lost their ability to recharge from in person social events, some people don\u2019t learn as well outside a classroom\u2026 I could keep going but I was a BIG deal. \n\nDepression also isn\u2019t something you can just snap out of no matter how much you wish it were the case. Unfortunately, if she\u2019s not willing to get professional help, you\u2019re not going to be able to convince her to. She has to be ready on her own terms to get better and change. It might be worth asking her to get help for your sake though\u2026 sometimes we\u2019re willing to do things for our partner that we\u2019re not willing to do for ourself if that makes sense. Like I don\u2019t feel worthy of help, but my husband deserves a wife who isn\u2019t depressed", "Pathetic.  People who are in touch with reality moved on from the \"pandemic\" in like August 2020", "You can move on from the pandemic easily, but not from the depression or other mental illnesses it caused."]}
