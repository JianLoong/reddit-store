No matter what you wear, there will always be insecure people like her, ready to judge you for simply existing with your body type. Do NOT let that woman plant a seed of doubt, or shame, within you. A tank top is not scandalous just because you have breasts.\n\nDon't let her insecurities dimish your shine \ud83d\udc9c", "Honestly? Don't you dare. Don't change what you normally wear to bed in your own home simply because someone can't handle it and wants to project instead of taking responsibility for their issues.", "You don't have to confirm this one way or the other it's mostly rhetorical,  but I'd be willing to bet she has little boobs and you do not. You were so much nicer just letting it go. She would have gotten a big \"fuck right off\" from me. Unless she was honest and was like \"I'm sorry but I have this insecurity with this\" then I would have been compassionate and nice. Zero patience for holier than thou condescending bullshit tho."]}
