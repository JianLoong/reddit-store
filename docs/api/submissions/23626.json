As your niece is taking a business class, she needs to learn about appropriate pricing and upping her game.", "NTA. It\u2019s a harsh business lesson for a child, but the reality is, competition is also relevant to prices. They must not have got to that yet in business class. New businesses regularly go into the red to begin with/start with capital due to the costs of entry, gambling that eventually they\u2019ll turn a profit to recoup those entry costs and then start actually making money. They\u2019re often not even making any wage, let alone way above minimum wage at that stage either. \n\nIf you can get better for less, then that is what the rational customer will do. To compete, she needs to either charge less or make a superior product. And yes, the name of the game is that in economies of scale, larger more established businesses are able to charge less and run off emergent competitors that don\u2019t bring anything special to the product.\n\nYou\u2019re also not obligated to fund her college, which appears to be the only marketing strategy she has.", "Nta  she can't rely only on family for business", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t pay top prices for less than perfect. I get she\u2019s learning but that\u2019s why she should have her prices reasonable. Charging an arm and a leg for something that doesn\u2019t also look pretty is super hard to justify. If she wants your support for things like this she should lower her prices or practice more.\n\nI\u2019m a crocheter and all for paying someone what they\u2019re worth but niece is over valuing herself and I\u2019m sure she knows it already which is why SIL is upset you \u201cstopped supporting niece\u201d aka paid a professional a decent price for well decorated and likely delicious cupcakes.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe has learned hwo to calculate. Now she has to learn about competition, quality control, and how pricing impacts demand.", "NTA if she's learning about business then this is a lesson about pricing her product accordingly. She shouldn't be charging more than a professional baker but delivering a lower quality product. An important part of running a business is sometimes lowering your costs on one transaction to entice a return customer, but she sounds to be focused on a 1-time sale and maximising the money on that sale with no thought to a repeat income. \nIt's a tough lesson, but you shouldn't be guilted into buying a product that is below par.", "NTA\u2026it is a business for your niece and as such, she has to learn how business works.  Who is going to pay more for cupcakes that look way less than someone else\u2019s who look better and have the same taste?  If your nieces cupcakes are good, people will buy them.  If not, they will not.", "NTA, if she is also going to charge more than bakeries her product should rival theirs.  Plus technically her selling cupcakes can be deemed illegal because she doesn\u2019t have proper permits from the health department guaranteeing food safety.", "NTA.  You are allowed to put your custom wherever you see fit at any given time.  Its not like you haven't supported your niece in the past, but quite honestly (as you say) her finished product isn't quite up to the standard you are looking for for this event and she's charging way to much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Free of charge, so your SIL should be thankful and offer some complimentary cupcakes when she trying to up her game in baking.", "Give your sis the short version of what you wrote here. Tell her also,  that you would be happy to support your neice going to school by gifting her the cupcake amount on a gift card when she heads out in the fall. But for this shower, your 'friend has a very specific anesthetic she requires ' and you are going to have to get that elsewhere.", "NTA I\u2019m no way is she a professional. Does she have a food handlers card? Is she using a clean kitchen are there pets? So many things go into this not just money and decorating.", "High prices should have high quality. Business lesson learned. NTA.", " NTA. But how is your niece going to improve if you don't provide feedback. Gently, but still feedback. You can couch it in terms of comments from the batch you bought for the office. Note the delicious flavour, but comments about piping etc. She will only improve with practice.", "NTA - you can support her in ways besides buying cupcakes. Giving her advice to improve her business is support even.", "Top dollar, top product. She isn\u2019t delivering. NTA.", "People are always telling me that I should start my own business baking for people and I'm so good at it - but I know there is a big leap between 'nice looking homemade' and 'professional' baked goods and while I am good at the first I fall very short of the second.  You need to be self aware with thus stuff.", "Absolutely, and this is where the niece is going wrong. \nSomeone raised a very valid point about whether the niece has the required health permits.\n\nIn the UK, you have to register with the local authority, as well as keeping records for income tax (if income will be greater than \u00a31,000).\n\nIt\u2019s also recommended that people do food safety certification.  Then there is the knowledge around food allergies. Running a food related business carries a lot of responsibilities.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA\n\nApprentices charge less than journeymen.  Your niece's skills aren't up to the price she's charging yet.\n\nAs to ingredients, your niece is probably paying retail, not wholesale prices.  The ingredients aren't better, they're just more expensive.", "NTA. This is an event you're planning for someone who is not a member of the family, and who therefore won't care who did the baking. They'll care about taste and appearance. Your SIL is being unreasonable and your niece is old enough to research her competitors in the field.", "NTA and your SIL has no business expecting you to buy solely from your niece. If it\u2019s for work or a party you want the food to look well presented. If this is not the case and she\u2019s overcharging then buying elsewhere is perfectly acceptable.", "NTA.  You want the cake & cupcakes to look profressional & if hers don't, why would you want them?  And if she is overpriced, why would you buy them?  I get they want you to support her, but if she isn't doing a good job, & her prices are too high, it doesn't make sense to get them from her.  She's only 15 & has a lot to learn.  She shouldn't be charging such high prices as she is just starting out.", "NTA it\u2019s one thing to support her privately. But when you host a gathering the quality of the food and cake is judged and reflects on you and the person who\u2019s event it is.", "NTA. You need to order food for work from a commercial kitchen, not a relative. Too much opportunity for repercussions due to food borne illness. The baby shower? You could always order some cookies from your niece as well as the professional cupcakes if you want to support her.", "NTA\n\nWould tempted to say, \u201cIf you cared so much about her saving up for college, you should take on that financial responsibility yourself. Seeing as *you\u2019re* her parent. It\u2019s not up to me to pick up your slack.\u201d\n\nBut for real, the quality has to match the price.\n\nThese people aren\u2019t entitled to your money. You\u2019ve already shown support.", "Nta, she has to be aware that she has competition and if she stays expensive, there will always people who buy with the cheaper ones. If your niece wants to do it as a job one day, mommy can't save her there, too.", "This 100 percent! Plus it\u2019s one thing to buy a dozen cupcakes for a small event. Is your neice capable of doing a big order a shower would require.\n\nThat is a bit ambitious to take on. She may think she can but in reality you could be without the proper amount of food for your event.", "I get the idea about giving the amount of the cupcakes on a gift card but that would be a hard no for me.\n\nI would not start this habit. Every time op buys from another baker this will be the new expectation. They already think they are entitled to overcharge and that op should suck it up because it\u2019s family. If op does this then the neice will think she is entitled to get paid for others work.", "NTA - she is over pricing for the quality provided - and not doing that is a fundamental part of business and you should not be embarrassed by the appearance of the cupcakes you take to somone else's special event.", "Niece wants to be strictly business with family, ok! You found a better product for a better price. Just good business sense, right?", "NTA-She is only 15. You can\u2019t be great at something right away. Knowing this, what if you suggest that your niece take a pastry class/course. There probably is something local to get her started. If she brings up watching stuff on YouTube or ticktock, shoot it down, fast! She will do better with in person teaching. If she has a real business, I bet she could write it up as a \u201cbusiness expense\u201d. Either way, if she is serious about this, real class is the way to go. (Otherwise there wouldn\u2019t be J&W or CIA)", "\"For what she charged me, I could have gotten more and much better looking cupcakes at a well-known bakery in town.\"\n\nNothing else matters, you get to spend your hard earned money wherever you want, if you want a certain quality at a certain price go for it. That's how the market works, people buy things with expectations of quality depending on the price they are paying for, if niece's product is so pricey that a local bakery can make better at the same price, then she needs to find another strategy (not being too greedy for example)\n\nNTA", "NTA. But SIL is a bully. Self-righteous, too.\n\nI swear, nothing like this ever happened in my small town when I was growing up. If someone ordered cupcakes from A, no one phoned to berate the buyer from not ordering from B.\n\nIf people stopped getting into convos with termagants like SIL and instead tore her apart for her stupid anger, there would be less of it.\n\nAnd don't ever order from your niece again. Let SIL stew in her juices.", "\\^ This! If I order filet mignon and get a hamburger instead for the price. It wouldn't be worth going back to that restaurant.", "I wasn't thinking of a forever deal... I was more thinking mom would get the hint that her daughter needed to work on her presentation skills in reference to the 'anesthetic' comment. I was trying for a nicer way to say 'tastes like heaven, looks like hell' for OP", "Yeah, this is a concern I\u2019d have too in any situation where I\u2019m serving the items I purchased to anyone outside closer family/friends. In my (US) state, you have to have a license and use a commercial kitchen for publicly sold food. It\u2019s one thing if it\u2019s a family party, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for getting acquaintances sick because of cross-contamination or poor food handling.", "I know what you where thinking. But unfortunately the entitlement the sil has already showed this would open a whole new can of worms op doesn\u2019t want to deal with.\n\nYour suggestion was sweet especially since the niece is suppose to be using it as college money. But they may come to expect it every time op orders from someone else.", "Some states in the US have cottage food licenses and laws, so it could be legal.", "NTA - You can order from wherever you please and your sister doesn't get a say in that. However, being a home baker it's often difficult to price out your products. I do take home baking orders, and while I charge less than a bakery, you do get people bitching about pricing sometimes and it's tiring. I don't have the luxury of ordering things in bulk, having a ton of specialized equipment, or having a team behind me to make things go more smoothly and maximize my time. I don't get upset if people don't order from me, but I do get irritated when people complain when I charge $30 for a fully decorated cake and they tell me that a box mix is only a dollar.\n\nI would highly encourage your niece to see if there are community college or continuing education classes aimed towards home baking businesses. The Philosophy of Yum blog and the Better Baking Club are also great resources when it comes to pricing your home goods, and there are a couple subreddits dedicated to home baking. Find other ways to support your niece if you feel about about not doing it monetarily.", "NTA. She's selling on the open market and needs tp learn that if her sales in part depend on how she stacks up against the competition and right now her technical skills are substandard and prices are high. \n\nYou don't exist to subsidize her college", "NTA.  You are entitled to have professional work done for a professional price.  Your niece has not supplied that.", "NTA but give honest feedback to your niece directly about the pricing and decoration. That will help her in business.", "One of my coworkers sells her stuff based out of her kitchen but she still had to get like licenses and stuff for it. Tbh my coworkers buy a bunch of shit from her so if it's applicable in your zone it's not a bad idea. She mostly sells cookies and pies and some brownies. Nothing crazy.", "I'm happy with baking being my stress relief, not the cause of my stress.", "NTA - a family member starting a business doesn't mean you HAVE to always use their business and that expectation is unfair and selfish.", "NTA", "Yeah good idea to keep money and hobbies separate I think \ud83d\udc4d"]}
