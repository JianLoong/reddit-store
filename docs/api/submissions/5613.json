I\u2019m sure having the kid there with the drama wasn\u2019t any better.", "You seem to know what OP is thinking better than OP does.  Do you do parties?", "I think it's a little ridiculous to expect just the child to show up. At the very least, a parent would be walking into the house to make sure the child is received and safe before leaving. And I can only imagine how it would be used against OP if she simply dropped him off and left as quickly as possible. We don't know how old the child is, and anything under 8, I'm not leaving my son alone with a hostile woman who's too immature to blame the right person around.", "That is the point of view of OP who is minimising the relationship that the fianc\u00e9e and ex had at that time by calling it just sleeping together. But from the fianc\u00e9e's point of view that would be considered an affair, and would make the whole situation delicate and needs to be treated appropriately (aka call before visiting)", "Eh, suprises are a thing.\n\nIt\u2019s just if you stop by uninvited, you have to be ready and willing to accept being turned away. (And if you have been explicitly instructed to always call first, that would be rude.)", "I mean OP was kinda cheated on since she didn't know he was in a relationship when they were together.", "I think it's a little more complicated than \"OP is the affair partner\". They were together, broke up, and were talking about getting back together when she got pregnant and found out that he was already with his new gf(stb-fiancee). \n\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv2wac/aita_for_ruining_christmas_eve_for_my_exs_fianc\u00e9e/j1mrlu1?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\nIt's honestly crazy that his new gf agreed to become his fianc\u00e9e after he was essentially caught playing both women.", "Edit for clarification: when I said the anger should be directed at the ex for being unfaithful I was not meaning to imply that you were angry at OP, I meant that the fianc\u00e9 should be angry at the man she is engaged to and not the mother of his child.\n\nBut the child is a child and a parent comes as part of a package deal. Why should the OP give up time with her son during the holidays just because the ex\u2019s fianc\u00e9 gets upset? And realistically if the ex\u2019s fianc\u00e9 gets this angry and aggressive just by seeing OP, how could you even think OP could trust that her son would be safe around them in her absence?\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is an adult, she should be able to behave like one. No matter what she wishes, If she continues her relationship with the OPs ex, OP will forever be in her life because OP is the mother of the ex\u2019s son and already has an established relationship with her son\u2019s grandparents.\n\nRealistically all OP did was not give prior warning, but she already established that based on prior patterns of behavior she assumed ex and his fianc\u00e9 would not be there on time so that she could bring her son to the grandparents without disruption.\n\nSo there is no reason to think op is an AH.", "We don\u2019t know the legal custody agreement and we can assume that if OP has the son for Christmas, she either has primary custody or had him this year for the holidays. OP already stated they dated for years. If they wanted to see the son, OP was coming too. \u201cDropping by\u201d is also a max of 1 hour. As someone who said earlier, if the child is under 8, the parent is coming with because that\u2019s to be expected.", "Oh, I'm not saying she should have dropped off her son by himself. She should have simply called the family to see when a good time would be for them to stop by for a visit together instead of just showing up without any notice. To just drop in unannounced to someone else's Christmas Eve gathering is pretty rude, especially when you don't get along with everyone there and there is a high potential for conflict.", "Don\u2019t cheat on people then. Ex is still the problem", "They were \"talking about getting back together\" while he was with his now fianc\u00e9e. OP's friends are the ones that told her he had been sleeping with the now fianc\u00e9e since they broke up, so if I had to guess, I'd say OP ended the idea of getting back together when she found out. Both women were cheated (imo). I think fianc\u00e9e should be mad at the cheater, not the victim or innocent child.", "yea, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it an affair. It sounds more like ex played both of them because ex and OP were talking about getting back together. Plus OP didn\u2019t specify if ex and fianc\u00e9e were dating, just that they were sleeping together. We don\u2019t know if it was an actual official relationship.", "Euh, we are not here speaking of his cheating. While that is despicable. We are speaking of op who showed up unannounced knowing there is this delicate situation (even though she was invited before she made it clear she wasn't going, then showed up without prior notice) and when things escalated as they would she refused to leave and the fianc\u00e9e left. And to me in this ESH."]}
