Your son is your ex's child, without any clarification on point 2, presuming you got invited in, why did you need to even be there in the first place? Why not say no thanks and go about your way and get back to your family? It's not like these are some random strangers, this is your son's family on his Dad's side, surely his biological mother doesn't need to be the one to take him there let alone be there with him for any extended time. \n\n4. Why did you not check in advance to see if the ex and his fiance were there? Cheating aside and whether or not you were aware of your ex's infidelity towards his now fiance, your statement seems to imply that you are very much aware that there are bad feelings and emotional trauma there on her part from potentially seeing you and common sense would dictate that maybe it's not the most emotionally healthy thing for you to show up to a party where your ex lover and his fiance are present, the ex with whom you had an unknowing affair with.

I mean, if I were OP I would be super angry for some random on the internet to tell me that they know my mind better than I do.\n\n> I don't drag my kid to parties without confirming we are invited and will be fed.\n\nOP and kid were invited, by the kid's grandparents, so why are you bringing up your party virtue here?\n\n> I also don't bring my kid to a place where their presence could create conflict\n\nAgain, OP and kid were invited.  Grandparents were actively complaining about not seeing kid on Christmas.  There's conflict here regardless - OP gets to choose the conflict with the grandparents for withholding the kid during Christmas, or the possibility of conflict with grown-ass adults who are perfectly capable of acting civil about not liking another grown-ass adult for the sake of children being with their grandparents.\n\nI know which one I would choose - the one that prioritized my kid's relationship with apparently-perfectly-pleasant grandparents.  Obviously you would choose the other conflict, the one that put you at odds with the grandparents for the sake of maintaining the feelings of (let's say it again) grown-ass adults who are perfectly capable of being civil if they want to, or who can throw temper tantrums instead.  I mean, it's a choice.\n\n> I don't know why she did it, but I sure don't buy her story.\n\nYour weird conflict-avoidance is not what everyone chooses and is not the objectively correct course of action.  But none of this is relevant to telling OP \"I think I know what you were REALLY after\" like a teenager with a Tarot deck.  Which is objectively rude, 'splainy, and very likely to be wrong.", "Yeah I don\u2019t buy it either.", "I completely agree. All of the N T A votes make zero sense to me. This woman was looking for drama 100% and she found it.

It would have taken five seconds to send a text or make a phone call if she wanted to stop by. It\u2019s unthinkable to show up to someone\u2019s holiday gathering without notice.

Both of my grandmothers always had all day open houses on Christmas. Both never knew who might drop by \u2014 exes with their new families, old friends from high school, neighbors who\u2019d moved away. It was the way they liked it, and if a new fianc\u00e9 got pissed because an ex showed up (with or without a kid) the new fianc\u00e9 would have been the one in the wrong. There was absolutely no expectation that anyone call or give a warning before dropping by. \n\nIf her exes family has this type of gathering I can completely see how it would not occur to her to call first.\n\nOne of grandmothers would say, \u201cyou chose to break up with the person, not the rest of us.\u201d Pretty much the only way to get uninvited was abuse. Not everyone likes it but it certainly set the tone for all children being welcome no matter what was going on with the adults.", "OP's comments suggest that she knew the family for quite a while.

Some people actually like people dropping by. I'm not one of them but It used to be a thing people did on Christmas.  \n\n\nBaby Daddy is the asshole. He should've set up a visit between the child and their grandparents. He also shouldn't marry his fiance until she accepts his baby and their mama will always be in their lives.

And good luck to that kid with these three as parental figures.
