We brought out 2 kids (4 & 7). When we got to dinner my husbands sister immediately ordered a martini. I reminded her that our kids where here and I would applicate it if she didn't drink in front of them my husband and I think it is inappropriate. \n\nMy husband and I enjoy a drink every now and again too but we do not drink when are children are present only when we have a night out without them. FIL and MIL respected our wishes and didn't order any drinks even though they would usually order a few bottles of wine. his sister is notorious for getting tipsy at family dinners and we don't want our children seeing that. I pointed out to her that she was the only one at the table who ordered a drink and that it was a little embarrassing that she was the only one who was drinking.\n\nMIL told me to drop it so I did and SIL ended up ordering 2 more martinis and of course was tipsy. The rest of the dinner was awkward because of SIL's drinking and everyone left as soon as the meal was over no dessert or coffee when usually we would stay and mingle over coffee or go back to one of our homes. SIL husband has to drive them home because he was tipsy. My Husband has been quiet and finally this morning as he was getting ready for work he told me he wished I wouldn't have said anything and I was the one who ruined things. I told him it was his sisters drinking that made everyone uncomfortable. \n\nI know she is young and has no kids but I really don't feel a family dinner where kids are in attendance is the place to drink and get tipsy. I don't think not drinking in front of children is too much to ask she can do that at home or when she is with her friends. I'm just trying to be a good mom and look out for my kids.", "created_utc": 1675870801, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x11os/aita_for_asking_my_sil_not_to_drink_at_dinner/", "score": 1133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was it your birthday party? If not, then it wasn't your dinner to make the rules about who drinks. Everyone came to that dinner expecting to celebrate your FIL the way he would like to celebrate (with a few glasses of wine), and your entitlement squashed the whole evening and you made it about yourself.\n\nYour values about drinking are your own and people the world over drink in front of their kids.

It is up to them to decide what is acceptable behavior, not you.  There are plenty of families who serve alcohol at family events, even at home.  You are the only one who was \"uncomfortable\" with her drinking; but they all were uncomfortable with you picking a fight about it.\n\nYour children are not going to be harmed in any way by \"witnessing\" someone being \"tipsy.\"", "She doesn't have kids of her own. She had her husband there as a DD, as responsible drinkers do. She got tipsy, not wasted. She doesn't have to abstain from alcohol because *your* kids are present.

Your own husband says you were wrong. **YTA.**", "YTA yes, she is an adult and can make her own choices.

You cannot control the actions of other people. Had you not said anything SIL might\u2019ve only had one drink. I\u2019m sure the family is used to her drinking. Willing to bet you calling her out made the dinner awkward.", "YTA. It's a *party.* \n\nStop policing the behavior of others. If you don't want people drinking around your kids, don't bring your kids to restaurants. You are the one that made it awkward. Your SIL did nothing wrong.", "YTA. \n\nIf you think drinking infront of children is inappropriate, that\u2019s fine for you to decide for yourselves. You cannot dictate to other people that they not drink at a dinner out because your kids are there and you think it\u2019s inappropriate. \n\nI drink in front of my kid, and other people\u2019s kids. Other people drink in front of my kids. It isn\u2019t inappropriate to everyone.", "YTA. You don't want to drink in front of your kids then don't drink in front of your kids. You don't want people that you invite over to drink in front of your kids, then don't serve alcohol. If the legal and socially acceptable activities that occur at a venue violate what you think your kids should be exposed to the solution is to not go there, not to go and try to police other people's bechavior. I'm actually far more upset that you prevented your FIL from having wine that you knew he would have enjoyed having when this was ostensibly his birthday you were celebrating than your inappropriate and obnoxious comments to/about your SIL.  \n\n\nNot only are you in the wrong here in general, but I'm sure your efforts were the reason your SIL ordered a 3rd drink.  \n\n\nPS Do you think anyone actually believes that you did this to be a good mom and look out for \\[your\\] kids?", "yta\n\nher drinking made you uncomfortable no one else\n\nyou sound insane\n\nits a birthday dinner\n\ndont like it take your kids and leave\n\njust because you dont drink around your kids do not mean they cant\n\nunless its your house any rules you have dont have to be followed\n\nyou made everyone uncomfortable by being a female kevin", "YTA. Sounds like it was awkward cause others wanted to drink but you were shaming anyone who dared order one.", "YTA.  You don't get to set rules for other adults in public.  If you don't want your kids to witness the heinous sight of an adult having a martini, they should probably stay home sheltered from the world.\n\nIf you are seriously looking out for your kids, you will let them witness this sort of thing and explain that when adults drink to much, they do silly things and can make bad decisions.    Hiding them from it isn't doing them any good.", "YTA.  You can't force your rules on other adults.  Many people drink.  Some don't (I don't happen to drink).  Your kids see people drinking at other tables in restaurants.  They see people drinking on TV and in movies.  You don't have the right to police other people's choices.  You owe everyone an apology.  You ruined the evening.", "YTA... it sounds like the only person who has a problem with SIL's drinking is you.", "I am fast forwarding to when your kids are in college. They will likely be the ones black out drunk every weekend because they never saw adults model healthy behavior towards alcohol. YTA. You don't get to police the very normal beverage choices of other adults.", "YTA. As a matter of fact, it's not really harmful to a child if they occasionally see someone drinking alcohol even to the point of being tipsy. It would be different if your kids were exposed to it every single day, but they're not.", "You can\u2019t police the behavior of adults that isn\u2019t dangerous.

If you don\u2019t want to drink in front of your children, that\u2019s perfectly fine. But it\u2019s not your place to tell other people of legal drinking age when and how they can consume alcohol.

For one, it's totally unrealistic to shield your kids from alcohol like that, unless you want to be a hermit. For two, this was not your event, it's not your place to set the rules. If you DID want to have an absurd rule like that, you needed to bring it up to everyone ahead of time and get their agreement.", "YTA. Next time leave your kids with a sitter if you are uncomfortable with people ordering drinks. Your feelings of entitlement are unnecessary & annoying.", "YTA and it\u2019s pretty sad that you ruined someone else\u2019s birthday dinner. You owe everyone there an apology most of all your FIL.", "YTA. The world doesn't revolve around you and your kids. The dinner almost certainly ended early because of *you*. Did you ever think maybe your FIL wanted to enjoy a drink on his birthday, but didn't want to deal with your drama? Don't be surprised when you stop getting invited to events.", "YTA. The dinner wasn't awkward \"because of SIL's drinking\", it was awkward because you thought it was any of your business policing whether a grown woman can enjoy a drink with dinner.

Leave your children at home if they cannot handle going to a public restaurant that serves alcohol. How do you justify other tables having drinks?", "Sounds like you should\u2019ve stayed home with your kids instead of judging and ruining the dinner for everyone.

You can live your life the way you want, but don\u2019t force your ideologies on others. Your overuse of the word tipsy says a lot about your hate for alcohol.

Birthdays are a time for celebration and it sounds like you should start staying home if you can\u2019t change your attitude.

They're 4 and 7. If SIL or anyone wants to drink, that's on them. If you host a party, you can make the rules but anywhere else suck it up or stay home.

The only one making things awkward was you trying to impose your Puritanical views on other adults. Grow up.", "YTA. I don\u2019t drink and I think YTA. You were at a restaurant.

FIL and MIL would have usually ordered wine and this was his birthday and they didn\u2019t because YOU stipulated no one should drink around your children.\nDid you align everyone on this beforehand?

FIL and MIL respected our wishes and didn't order any drinks even though they would usually order a few bottles of wine. his sister is notorious for getting tipsy at family dinners and we don't want our children seeing that. I pointed out to her that she was the only one at the table who ordered a drink and that it was a little embarrassing that she was the only one who was drinking.\n\nMIL told me to drop it so I did and SIL ended up ordering 2 more martinis and of course was tipsy. The rest of the dinner was awkward because of SIL's drinking and everyone left as soon as the meal was over no dessert or coffee when usually we would stay and mingle over coffee or go back to one of our homes. SIL husband has to drive them home because he was tipsy. My Husband has been quiet and finally this morning as he was getting ready for work he told me he wished I wouldn't have said anything and I was the one who ruined things. I told him it was his sisters drinking that made everyone uncomfortable. \n\nI know she is young and has no kids but I really don't feel a family dinner where kids are in attendance is the place to drink and get tipsy. I don't think not drinking in front of children is too much to ask she can do that at home or when she is with her friends. I'm just trying to be a good mom and look out for my kids.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because I can pretty much guarantee they do mind not drinking, they just know how OP is and aren\u2019t willing to do anything rock the boat as OP seems like she\u2019d be more than willing to withhold access to the grandkids if they don\u2019t follow her every command.", "yeah the solution if its that important to you is not to make everyone else alter their behavior but to alter yours and oh i don't know get a sitter when you go to a dinner for an adults birthday where you know the adults will want to have a drink or two.", "Imagine if OP tried to pull that at a baseball game or similar.  \"No one can drink around my children!!\"  She's the Fun Police.\n\nOP, I feel sorry for your husband and kids.", "They drink but not in front of the kids. The lessons taught: only drink with other adults, it is such a bad thing to do that it can't be done around kids, be sneaky when you drink, you can't enjoy A drink with dinner, or during the day because drinking alcohol is so bad, you only drink to be drunk, etc.", "I'm sure OP was huffy the whole night because she doesn't get to control everyone at the table with her puritanism.", "I don\u2019t really drink but I would probably also need 3 martinis to get through dinner with the controlling op", "I was thinking this. I don\u2019t think OP realizes that creating a taboo around things like alcohol is what often leads to an unhealthy relationship with them in the future.", "Yes!! To this!!!!! once i was maybe 16 on summer vacations i was allowed to drink alcohol (and by that i mean the hard mike lemonades LMAOOO) in a very controlled family environment. My husband was never allowed even around alcohol, and no family was allowed to drink with kids around. I bet you can guess who had the unhealthy relationship with alcohol in college.", "Yeah the American attitude about children and drinking is deeply stupid. Basically prohibiting kids and adolescents from ever seeing healthy social drinking in multigenerational gatherings with people they trust, not allowing teens and young adults to drink, not having any concept of social spaces for teens/young adults that *don\u2019t* involve drinking, forcing teens to keep their drinking secret which is that much more dangerous when they have no experience doing it in moderation with family, mass-arresting teens for drinking in private homes, and by the way most of the country\u2019s transit infrastructure is so fucked that drunk driving is far more normalized than anyone cares to admit? (Doubt OP\u2019s kids will be calling her for a ride home in ten years.)\n\nOP is an asshole whose attitudes could put her kids in real danger, and her SIL did her kids a favor by modeling this behavior for them.", "My parents were super weird about alcohol. No one in my family drank at all, ever, no matter the occasion and man, it left me ill-prepared for the world. I very much overindulged in college because I had absolutely no idea what moderate drinking looked like, and now I'm extremely uncomfortable around alcohol. It really has made parts of my life weird, awkward and occasionally dangerous.", "When I was growing up (1960s) in some states it was legal for kids to consume alcohol if they were with their parents.  We traveled a lot and I can remember 7 year old me quite confidently ordering a mixed drink called a Golden Cadillac; my sister\u2019s drink of choice was a Grasshopper.  The attraction was both were made with ice cream.\n\nSister and I would sip for a while and then parents would finish them off.  As a result, alcohol was never a forbidden mystery to me so I never found it of interest when I grew up.  Might have a glass of wine a couple times a year, but that\u2019s it.", "This has big \u201cwon\u2019t someone PLEASE think of the children?!\u201d vibes. OP\u2019s kids are 4 and 7. I guarantee they are not concerned with who looks \u201ctipsy\u201d at dinner.", "I don't even drink alcohol and I would have been tempted to order something just to piss OP off", "Or before college.", "Can confirm. There was a girl in my dorm my freshman year whose parents strictly forbid drinking, very similar to OP, it was essentially \"alcoholis non grata\" in her family.   \n\n\nShe got alcohol poisoning within her first month because it was new, fun, exciting and very much the forbidden fruit for her.   \n\n\nI'm not saying thats the same for EVERYBODY. But I've seen similar and validating your comment.", "The word insufferable popped into my head. \n\nThose kids will be a nightmare when they're older because everything is taboo and they'll prob go hog wild.", "Ha! Same!", "A Peroni with a better personi", "Right! Euphemisms\u2026the mature subject workaround. \n\nIt\u2019s a good thing Aunt Flow came to visit because I had too much Jesus Juice last week and the last thing I need is another visit from the stork!", "I have family members like this 100% this is not just limited to alcohol. There\u2019s also other stuff people aren\u2019t allowed to do in front of her kids. Talk about PG-13 movies since her kids can\u2019t watch them (eyeing my one aunt), eat an extra helping of dinner since cousins are only allowed to eat once, weird rules to control everyone.", "At that point I\u2019d be making sure I left drunk if I was SIL", "\u201cOh, it\u2019s a dry party? Perfect. Two dry martinis, please.\u201d", "Oh SIL 100% ordered drinks 2 and 3 to make a point to OP. Petty? Sure. Justified? Also, yes.", "SO much THIS.  Look at the US vs Europe when it comes to minors and alcohol.  If something is forbidden it tends to make it more desirable.", "I was the only person I knew growing up whose parents would openly drink in front of my sister and me. Now, my sister and I tend to be the most controlled in our own alcohol consumption and rarely end up getting too drunk or stupid as a result. Likewise, we both have friends from dry households who can't seem to understand how to drink without getting absolutely hammered.\n\nI think it's a great idea to drink (casually, in a safe manner) around children. It removes the taboo of alcohol so they don't develop bad drinking habits as adults.", "I'm a lucky American then cuz my folks were very laid back about alcohol, were not alcoholics, and (shock and awe) neither my sister nor I have any alcohol problems at all. OP is definitely the one who ruined the vibe.", "Seriously. If drinking is a forbidden adult thing that only adults are ever allowed to even see, it's so taboo you can't even imagine your parents doing it--- it's suddenly the very coolest thing a teenager can do.", "With respecco", "Shit that woman deserves a medal for having the restraint to stop at 3, I would've needed a 4th to get past OP's attitude.", "With relatives like this, petty is survival!!!"]}
