{"id": 34616, "submission_id": "191s11s", "title": "AITA for not letting my mom move in with me?", "selftext": "For context: we're not from the US.\n\nMy (23F) parents' marriage (52F & 62M) have always been utterly toxic. She married him because she was homeless and wanted a family. Previous to my birth, he was total piece of crap to her and my siblings, and I know for sure some crimes were commited on his behalf during that time. After I was born, he got better.\n\nMy mother is very much toxic with me and my siblings. She calls us names, heavily criticizes our friends and relationships, tells we're \"cursed to be a failure\" because of dad, says that nobody likes her because \"people can't handle her showing them the truth about themselves\" and simply cannot addmit she's done anything wrong, unless it was somehow somebody else's fault. Today all of us are at universities halfway throught the major or almost finishing it. None of us is really close to our dad.\n\nTheir relationship is insufferable nowadays, beyond saving. They're living alone in our hometown ever since I moved. She has panick attacks everyday. They fight daily. They plan on getting a divorce as soon as the money lets, which would be when I graduate in 2026. My dad will move out then. I have no reason to not believe him, althought my mother doesn't.\n\nMy mother wants my dad to leave, but we can't afford another rent. The only option is for her to move into my small apartment in another state where I'm studying until I graduate. I reluctantly agreed, thinking it would help her, but it will be a burden for me. When she stayed with me before, it was tough. It also strained my 2-year long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (21M). She interrupted our calls and criticized us, which made me fight with her often.\n\nMy boyfriend lives in my hometown, and I stay with him every weekend. He's used to seeing his partner daily from past relationships, and our limited calls are tough for him. He despises my mother for her mistreatment of me. He feels foolish for sympathizing with her treatment towards me, only for me to let her interfere in our lives. He's upset, and I fear letting my mother move in would lead to a breakup. Friends agree, saying my parents are adults, and I can't save them.\n\nI decided to prioritize my life, studies and relationship. Told my mother I thought it would best if she didn't move in with me. She got upset, said how \"every time parents get divorced the the children choose one to forsake\". I feel guilty because she's suffering and she's my mom, but I think she can improve her own life without disrupting mine. She said if she does anything to my dad, it'll be my fault. College is already difficult for me and I value my relationship too much to let it end this way. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My abusive mom is having panick attacks everyday because of my abusive dad, she wants to move in with me, that would make my life hell and probably end my relationship with my boyfriend, so I refused and now she's upset.", "created_utc": 1704738398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191s11s/aita_for_not_letting_my_mom_move_in_with_me/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How that person treats people is the value that person should have. Having similar DNA has no value.", "You're NTA. If she's so confident that it would be your fault if she does something to your father. Please allow her to test that legal theory in the court of law. I'm sure your countries legal system would hold her accountable for any wrongdoing she might attempt, and bonus give her a place to stay.", "NTA \u2013 your parents both sound reeeeeeal shitty. Sorry about that; don't let them ruin your life.", "I told my mother many years ago that she better be nicer to my youngest sibling (half-sib) if she wanted anyone to help take care of her in her old age because I wasn't going to deal with it and I doubted my full sib would either. Spoiler alert, she wasn't any nicer, but she did double-down on guilt tripping.\n\nSome parents just suck as human beings and you need to prioritize your own mental health. NTA and stick to your decision. They are grownups and will just have to figure it out.", "NTA. Your mother is an adult and should be able to take care of herself. Not only that, but you are an adult as well and are supposed to be starting your own life on your own. And you are right - she can improve her own life without disrupting yours. \n\nAnd, if her kids wind up \u201cforsaking\u201d her, it\u2019s her own fault for her own behavior. Don\u2019t let her turn this around and make you the villain.", "Good for you for not letting your mom live with you. It would be a living hell. NTA", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to fix your parents' relationship or be the solution to their problems. You're setting boundaries, and that's crucial for your own personal growth and happiness. It's not selfish to prioritize your needs over someone else's demands, especially when those demands could negatively impact your life.", "Nope, NTA at all. I don't care what she needs or is going through. You don't deserve help from a child you have been abusive to. \n\nMy advice is to block her. Go to therapy for the guilt because you have nothing to feel guilty for and it's not serving you. You are a good person and you're being smart about your mental health and boundaries.", "NTA. Be strong and keep your distance.", "NTA - your mom has already proven to not respect your boundaries or relationships in the past. She is currently guilting you now. How do you imagine her living with you would be. She\u2019s manipulating you and pushing your buttons to get a reaction. My mom does the exact same thing. \n\nYou are prioritizing your mental health and relationship over your already established manipulative mother.", "NTA.  I know it's hard because you feel guilty, but ask yourself if you'd do the same things to your daughter that your mom has done to you.  \n\nCut them out of your life ASAP, they will only drag you down with them.  Speaking from experience.", "NTA \n\nYour mother is actively harsh, hostile and berating and belittling towards you. \n\nWhy would you actively want to invite someone like that into your life?! \n\nSo ya: it's totally natural to fight back and resist against that force in your daily life. \n\nThat said: sure: you're a kind and caring person, so you still care for her even if she wants to work against your best interest. So hopefully you can find a 3rd party to help take care of her. But other than that: \n\nNEVER-EVER let her into your home and life. \n\nOtherwise you will be inviting the devil directly into your home! And what unfolds afterwards is NOT going to be good for you.", "NTA...Your mother's constant physical presence has nothing positive to offer your life.  Move out, move on, and plan your own life.  Your parents can take of their own drama themselves.", "NTA. You deserve a break from the dysfunction and the chance to do things differently. You can\u2019t do that when you want better for yourself but your parent does not. Your Mom\u2019s bad choices are not your responsibility. You have no obligation to house someone who is a detriment to your wellbeing, Mother, or not.", "NTA.\n\nShe is a big girl, she can take care of herself.", ">My mother is very much toxic with me \n\nThat's all that needs to be said. NTA", "NTA, and to be honest, I would go no contact with both of your parents. You don't owe them anything, focus on your studies and relationship. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life.", "**NTA**. \n\nYour mom's toxic vibes are off the charts, and it's not fair for her to expect you to be her savior. You're juggling college, a relationship, and your own life \u2013 adding her drama to the mix is a recipe for disaster. It's tough, but you gotta prioritize yourself, especially when it comes to your mental well-being and relationship. Your friends are spot on; your parents are adults, and you can't fix their mess. Stay strong, focus on your studies, and keep that relationship drama-free. You're not responsible for your mom's choices or your dad's actions. Solid move standing your ground!", "NTA. your mother is insanely toxic and letting her live with you might ruin your life.\n\n>She said if she does anything to my dad, it'll be my fault. \n\nshe's guilt-tripping you to make you feel bad for not letting her move in with you.\n\nif you care about your sanity, stay away from her and focus on your own wellbeing. there is absolutely nothing wrong with being selfish and prioritizing yourself in this situation."]}
