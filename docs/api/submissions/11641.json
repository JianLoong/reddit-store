Rather than going non contact try boundaries instead such as not leaving the child alone with the grandparents and such.", "NTA- x 1000!    NO NO NO! Any father that 'does things' to their daughter needs to be cut out like the cancer they are.   You do everything you can to protect your son from even thinking its ok to do that.   Yes your MIL should be punished for staying with someone like that. Your husband needs to be told what's what!  So its ok for SILs to be hurt and have to deal with it her whole life but not dear Dad? Your husband needs to a get a big clue!", "NTA. Cut contact and have nothing to do with those awful people", "Yikes.... NTA and stand your ground. Do what you have to in order to protect your child not only from that abusive person, but also that toxic mind set. You have a husband problem too if that's what he thinks as well.", "NTA, but you have a **much** bigger problem here given that your husband doesn't agree with you - to the point that I question your decision to get pregnant in this marriage, knowing what you know. \n\nBut that ship has sailed, I know, so all you can do is move forward. \n\nMake it CLEAR to your husband that this is not up for debate. \n\nHowever, I think you may have to prepare yourself for the idea that your marriage is not likely to last. Your husband's sympathies are with his predator of a father, and apparently impending fatherhood of his own is not enough to move him off that stance. \n\nIt is my hope that seeing his baby born shakes something loose in your husband that causes him to see the light and help you in protecting your child. But what I think is sadly much more likely is that he'll dig in on his stance and possibly even sneak your child to see his parents when you're not around.", "You have one TRUE job in life.  Protect & raise your child to be a healthy adult. Period. Everything else is now secondary.  \n\nOne job. NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour main responsibility is to protect your children. This means kerping them away from people who do horrible things to children.\n\nIf your MIL is unhappy about it, she should disassociate herself from people doing horrible things to people. \n\nMIL is correct in her statement that she is being punished for staying married to FIL. She is wrong in believing that she does not 100% deserve this punishment.", "NTA, and i would very greatly question someone who wants my little baby around a sexual predator of kids.", "NTA. As a mother it's your job to protect and provide for your children and it sounds like your in laws wouldn't do either of those. Why does you husband want the kid to meet his father when that's the one who's done bad things to children before? It seems like your husband doesn't really care for the safety of his child or for your feelings in this situation. He just wants to make daddy proud and that concerns me, what kind of father will let his kid be around someone that's sexua\u0142ly abused one of his own kids? I'm worried your husband might do the same", "NTA", "Nta. Protect that baby. But you might not be able to stop your husband from seeing his parents with the baby without you being with them 24/7 so you need to get on the same page about this.", "NTA at all. You certainly can't leave the child with a pedophile (I'm assuming)!  You could do supervised visits though. \n\nI would talk to your SIL and find out her side of the story, not your husband's version.  If you really think this happens, you have to seriously consider your husband's role in covering it up. It doesn't sound like your in-laws OR your husband are trustworthy, tbh.  If you husband really believes that abuse should be swept under the rug, he probably won't honor your wishes to keep the baby away from his father.", "I assume what you're not revealing because of this subreddit's rules is that your father in law did something criminal in some way in a manner that was either depraved or out of control. If that is the case, and you have no way of knowing if he is probably rehabilitated, then NTA.\n\n\\[Judging from the comments, yeah.\\]", "\n\nIf I'm reading this correctly and the person you decided to co-parent with wants your child to have a relationship with a sexual predator, that's so much bigger than reddit. This is the sort of thing you need to be agreed on before deciding to have kids with someone.", "You are NTA for wanting this. But why did you have a child with someone who didn\u2019t condemn his father for abusing his sister? At the very least, why did you not have this conversation before you got pregnant?\n\nI don\u2019t mean to scare you, but unless your partner agrees, I don\u2019t see how you can enforce it. You\u2019d have to be with your child 24/7/365, and not only is that not realistic, it wouldn\u2019t be psychologically healthy for you or your child. If you spend an afternoon with friends/family, or if you go back to work, your partner could take the child to see his parents then. \n\nIf your partner isn\u2019t willing to cut off all contact, please negotiate other conditions (e.g. that you have to be there as well). \n\nGood luck.", "You\u2019re definitely reading it correctly. I thought we were on the same page many times but he changes his mind a lot. He doesn\u2019t want our son to have a relationship with his dad but at least meet him", "I agree, the FIL situation is manageable, the husband is the real concern here.", "NTA. Anyone who thinks it's OK for a sexual predator to come close to his child should not be a parent. MIL is as bad, so is your babies father if he wants his parents to see your baby.", "NTA. \n\nTo protect your child, no contact with his paternal grandfather, limited supervised contact with paternal grandmother, which ends the first time she brings him up. \n\nDo not hide his existence from your child. if you\u2019re not sure how to explain it in an age appropriate way, there are lots of resources for that. \n\nIt\u2019s due to my work, but I know too many families where grandparents who abused their children went on to abuse thrive grandchildren. \n\nIf his mom wants to stay married to the predator who sexually abused their child, she\u2019s a rotten person also and she deserves to be scorned and isolated.", "You're gonna need a custody order or something legal to prevent it from happening.", "You're definitely not the asshole for not wanting your kid near this guy.", "Absolutely not!  This is a hill to die on, OP, and honestly - how can your husband justify being in contact with them at all?  If ever there is a NC, completely-cut-out-of-your-life reason, this is it.  FIL should be dead to you.   No contact, not ever, under any circumstance.  \ud83d\ude21", "Would not trust her for even a moment alone with my child. Shame on her."]}
