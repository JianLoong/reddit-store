{"id": 32406, "submission_id": "18be0rr", "title": "AITA for speaking my mother tongue?", "selftext": "I (f23) am German with russian roots, so I grew up speaking both languages. I also have a lot of Slavic and Balkan friends and when I was 15y.o. I learned Bulgarian (out of fun) and given that I grew up with those languages it's very easy to connect with other Slavic or Balkan people because the languages are kind of similar and you always manage to understand eachother even though you might not speak the same language. Now to my question...My best friend Anna (f23) started dating Sandro (m22) around 7 months ago. She is German and only speaks German and English, Sandro is from Serbia. Once he found out that I speak russian he instantly started to joke around with me in Serbian and I often respond in Russian because it just doesn't really translate that well in another language. We both try to include Anna in these jokes and try to translate but while doing that the jokes usually aren't that funny anymore or she can't relate cause it's about growing up with immigrant parents. But lately Anna doesn't want Sandro and I speaking our mother tongues anymore and if we meet friends of his she usually tells me 'Don't tell them you have russian roots or show that you understand them.' if I ask why she always says that they would end up liking me more than her and that Sandro might lose interest in her to get to know me better. To me it doesn't make sense cause Sandro is CLEARLY head over heels in love with her and doesn't skip a chance to talk about her and how happy he is with her and that he feels like he won the lottery with her. Plus I am married and have a little daughter. So am I the A.Hole?", "created_utc": 1701789141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18be0rr/aita_for_speaking_my_mother_tongue/", "score": 27, "replies": ["nta - if she\u2019s bothered about other people being able to talk to sandro in his mother tongue maybe she should make an effort to learn it and not be left out. and that final sentence?? doubly nta she sounds weirdly jealous", "NTA for knowing enough to share a few jokes and give you both a chance to use your home languages.\n\nBut you will be TA if you continue to exclude your friend and have inside jokes without her after she has told you it hurts her feelings.  If you continue to have conversations that exclude her, even the most secure person will eventually assume you are talking about her, and either laughing at her or flirting with her bf.", "NOT THE AHOLE. Just because you two have a common interest in language doesn\u2019t mean you two are going to run off into the sunset together. This might be something the three of you need to talk about so no wires get crossed. In reality it\u2019s shitty of your friend to say \u201cdon\u2019t tell them you understand them\u201d", "NTA if she\u2019s feeling left out she needs to have a conversation with her bf about her insecurities. She can\u2019t dictate what either of you do, though I can easily see if it\u2019s just the 3 of you and you\u2019re joking around in a language she doesn\u2019t know she probably feels very bored, jealous and lonely.\n\nEdit \u270d\ud83c\udffb to everyone saying \u2018just learn the language\u2019 - dude, sometimes it\u2019s just not that easy. I used to work in a restaurant where I was the only one that spoke English. Did I learn? Yes, I studied, and I could get my needs across, but did I feel included? Lol NO. I wasn\u2019t fluent, I still couldn\u2019t participate. And Serbian? Not exactly easy.", "NTA. But you and I have a very different idea of \u201cfun\u201d. Mine does not include learning Serbian \ud83d\ude02", "I did an exchange year at an university with a lot of international students and as rule of thumb, we only spoke the language everyone understood in that room so we didn't exclude anyone or have them feel excluded, even if they didn't actively take part in that conversation. It was just a thing of kindness.\n\nSo, from my point of view, it's YTA - but only a little. Just imagine how she feels having a conversation going on right next to her and being actively excluded? You might not mean anything by it but how would she know?", "You are an asshole for speaking in front of your friend in a language which they don't understand. You are making Anna feel like a third wheel when she is with you and Sandro, Save the jokes for when she is not present.  Also, I hope that you are teaching your daughter your languages.\n\nYou don't need to hide your roots or the fact that you speak multiple languages. This is something to be proud of, but don't be rude and speak them in front of people in your company.", "soft YTA. I've been in your position, and in general it is polite to talk in a language that everyone in the group can understand. If its just you and Sandro and a bunch of other Slavs, speak Russian. If you want Anna to be a part of that group, speak whatever language everyone can understand.", "NTA. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0438 \u0435 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0430. \u041e\u0449\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e \u0438 \u0449\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u044a\u0431\u0441\u043a\u0438. \u0410\u043a\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0443 \u0441\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0438 \u0435\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u0443.", "NTA.\n\nAnna is certainly an insecure AH.", "NTA but I think it would be a great and compassionate response to offer to help her learn some Serbian/Russian. I know languages are hard and she might be initially resistant, but I think a good starting point would be offer to teach her some simple phrases she could surprise Sandro with. Even if she never achieves fluency, having some basics down + your translations would probably help her appreciate the jokes much better.", "Actually I think it is crazy because you have husband and daughter and you look loyal and not interesting in any romantic relationship with him. Your friend is just jealous. \nDon't worry about it. You are absolutely right and you are NOT the Asshole.", "What do you think how fast that goes and how long it takes to be fluent enough to understand jokes?\n\nAs someone who speaks 5 languages: a year with extensive training and daily use minimum!\n\nThey speak other languages that she understands. It would just be nice to not exclude her while she's right next to them.", "I've tried to have a conversation with both of them but as soon as I bring it up she shuts me down cause she doesn't want Sandro to know that she thinks that way and she always says that she isn't jealous, she just doesn't want to feel left out which I GET!!! And she never says things like that Infront of him just when it's only me and her.", "Yes I get that but we do translate it and it's not always or constantly. But I do get that it kinda sucks for her in those moments.", "Yes I know it's weird but I love the look people get when they hear how many languages I am fluent in\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02 and since learning languages comes easy to me I thought why not use that to my advantage since I'm talentless otherwise.\ud83d\ude02", "And when would I be alone with him?

You can throw in a word here or there, but to exclude someone from conversations is extremely rude. \n\nMy mother speaks 9 languages.
