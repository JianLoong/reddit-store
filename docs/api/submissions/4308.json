The second you were knocked off of it you heard his true feelings hidden behind separating languages by blaming other imaginary men for his feelings. He is a gentleman as long as you fit the perfect image of what he thinks a woman should be. He has yo-yoed you once before now you are so turned around you are second guessing your very real and fair feelings about his bullshit attitude. Don\u2019t lose yourself trying to pretzel yourself into a pleasing shape for him.", "Gentlemen slut shame their partner?", "[removed]", "Your bf sucks.

Free stuff?  Fun?  Clout?", "You make a good point. No one would know unless he says something. Which comes his point he said \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell anyone this.

But the fact is that you have a whole thread of people telling you that this isn't okay, him saying it at ALL isn't okay. And I will once again say that the fact he brought it up and is trying to change what you do, something you like doing, because he's \"so concerned\" is a GIANT red fucking flag to me.", "Also OP, I wanted to say - being a celebrity doesn't make someone 'high class'. The language you use really feels like you think your BF is standing up for you, and that 'high class' people wouldn't usually hang out with someone like you.

I am female and was never approached for parties, hearing the way the girls who were invited by some of the acts were talked about there were\u2026 expectations.\n\nIs it appropriate for him to say what he did? No. And i firmly believe you can hang out and have nothing physical happen, however there\u2019s definitely a reputation and an expectation attached to the girls who are invited to those things whether or not it\u2019s true and whether or not you deserve it it\u2019s attached to you too.

Who are these supposed fictional men who are thinking this about you? And why should you care about their nonexistent feelings?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> But doesn\u2019t want anyone knowing what I did because he would have to explain it\u2019s not what it looks like, and I\u2019m not this person others might think I am.\n\nThis is entirely a problem of his own making based on the opinions of people who don't actually exist - I'm gonna be honest OP, it sounds like he's projecting his own feelings onto an acceptable and nonexistent party to avoid telling you to your face what he's really thinking. This feels like a form of negging, and a really gross form of it to boot.\n\nHis entire argument is based on 'what-if's' that nobody worth having in your life would think - it's manipulative, and it's meant to put doubt in you - and it has. It's done it's job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He stated \u201cif any random female said they entertained, went to shows, dinner, and back to their tour bus to hang out and smoke, that female would be deemed a gross individual and maybe even a slut,\n\nLiterally nobody but a deeply misogynistic asshole who sees women as property would think this OP. I would think this was neat, most people probably would. No man worth knowing or even sharing oxygen with thinks these things, and if your boyfriend knows people like this it's probably an indicator of who he is and what opinions he holds.\n\nNote, for instance, how he used the term 'female' instead of 'woman' - this is very common among incels and similarly thinking men who use it to dehumanize and generalize women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Even if they weren\u2019t directly towards me. I feel offended and attacked by his words.\n\nAs you should, because while he didn't directly say these things about you, he heavily implied them with the scapegoat of some random, made-up 3rd party so as to not put himself in the line of fire while also being able to 'tell it as it is' or whatever nonsense I'm sure he's defending this as.\n\nHe is manufacturing a situation so that he can insult and degrade you and get out of it because 'but I'm just saying I would never let anyone say such horrible things about you!'\n\nThe only one saying those things to begin with is him. The only one who ever would say those things? You guessed it - him.\n\nThrow his ass out, you weren't even dating when this happened - he doesn't own exclusive rights to you, you were single at the time.

That is some puritan shit. Notice how your bf is implying the girl with such a behavior could be seen as a slut, but not the guys from the band entertaining this behavior?\nThis is double-standard.

His words is pure manipulation tactic, nothing more.", "He was shaming you.", "He either thinks these things or is more concerned about what judgmental guys think than your autonomy.

Bonus for the act of pretending to care about you while telling you what to do.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Also... if He's so worried about what other guys think and defending you to other guys, maybe he shouldn't tell them? For anyone who's never been on or had the opportunity or known someone who's chilled on a tour bus with musicians, it's REALLY not the talk of the town.
