Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n \n\nHey, Reddit, I (30F) am in desperate need of your judgment because my family is making me feel like a monster.\n\nSo, a few months ago, my sister (27F) and her husband (30M) had some major relationship issues. They were constantly fighting and on the verge of divorce. It got so bad that my sister reached out to me for help. Being the supportive sister that I am, I offered her a place to stay until they figured things out.\n\nNow, here's where things get tricky. Shortly after moving in, my sister dropped a bomb on me: she's pregnant. I was shocked because it seemed like the worst possible time to bring a child into their already tumultuous relationship. Nevertheless, I supported her decision and continued to let her stay in my house.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, and my sister's husband decided to reconcile with her. They decided to give their marriage another shot, which I thought was great. However, here's where the real issue began.\n\nMy sister and her husband started behaving like they owned the place. They would constantly argue and disturb the peace of my home. They would leave their belongings strewn everywhere, make a mess in the kitchen, and never clean up after themselves. It was like I was living with two teenagers.\n\nOn top of that, they completely disregarded my rules. I asked them to contribute to the household expenses, considering they were living there and eating the food I provided. But they refused, claiming they had enough financial strain with the baby on the way. I felt used and taken advantage of.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, they also started throwing parties in my house without my permission. Can you imagine coming home after a long day to find your house filled with strangers, loud music, and alcohol? It was a complete violation of my privacy and personal space.\n\nFeeling overwhelmed and unappreciated, I finally snapped. I confronted my sister and her husband about their behavior, telling them they needed to respect my rules and contribute to the household. But they laughed it off and brushed me aside, saying I was overreacting.\n\nUnable to handle the constant chaos and disrespect, I made a tough decision. I told them they had one week to find a new place to stay and that I no longer wanted them in my house. It was a shock to them, but I felt it was the only way to protect my own sanity.\n\nWell, Reddit, ever since I kicked them out, my family has been bombarding me with messages, calling me heartless and selfish. They claim I should have been more understanding since my sister is pregnant and that I've ruined their chances of a happy family. But I can't help but feel like I did the right thing.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for kicking my pregnant sister out of my house? Did I overreact to the situation, or was this a necessary step to protect my own well-being?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You gave them a chance to contribute and act reasonable but they just disrespected that. If your family has a problem with it, they should let them move into their own houses.

How did her husband come to live with you? It sounds like they lived somewhere else before and your sister moved in and not her husband.
