What if things don't go well and you end up with a high risk pregnancy requiring weeks or months of bedrest? Sometimes things go really really wrong and your newborn requires a long stay in the hospital and intensive medical treatments and supports in the home that would suddenly bring your nursing career to your living room.

There is no great time to have a baby, you'll always be able to come up with legitimate reasons to wait. However, once the baby arrives, the love and joy you feel us unmatched and it's a lot easier to figure out a schedule that works than you might think. Also, she said she's 30 now, which obviously means she'll be 35 in 5 years. It's not impossible by any means, but it starts to become increasingly difficult for a woman to get pregnant every year she gets older, and some find that by the time they've reached 35 they have unfortunately aged out. Studies are being done about the long-term effects of birth control and its role in this problem, but even if she never took birth control, she's already past her prime child bearing age now at 30. There's a reason pregnancies after 35 are called geriatric pregnancies. Just a couple things to think about.", "Plus clinical placements. OP is doing anywhere from 1-3 days in a clinical placement each week, plus whatever courses they have.", "As her dad getting custody he needs to be the one looking for childcare to fit HIS schedule and maybe O.P.\u2019s.

I was actually way busier that day than on my class and work days.", "I tell my graduate students that thinking is work!", "Agreed. As someone who is in nursing, I was definitely busier in school.

Between courses and homework, I have much less available time than I do now.", "Oh god grad school for counseling psychology caused me to have a mental breakdown for two reasons 1) it was so much all at once all the time and 2) I realized that if I went into the field I would hate my life, hate my job, and dread waking up every morning.

It took me awhile to find the correct birth control pills that worked for me, but allll of the pill packs had aluminum.

Plus you still have assignments to complete at the same time.", "That is exactly why some people will spend the entire day in a library.", "And when she is on a hospital placement, she can just get her sick patients to hold the baby.

It's scary what people will do to trap someone!", "I'm not sure exactly how long they do it for, but exposing bc to high temperatures makes them significantly less effective. I looked it up because I thought it would be dumb of people to blow up their microwave by being garbage, but it turns out it's not guaranteed the pills will damage the microwave and it doesn't need too long of an exposure to heat.", "Thank you!

Not to mention that it'll be at least a year before new baby is born, what with the trying and then the pregnancy itself.", "As a parent, those are all things you should want to do, not feel obligated to do. You shouldn't have children at all if you are going to view and treat them as an inconvenience, or just as work. As far as the bills are concerned, she's not working now, so I would have to assume her fiance is paying them. Also, let me add, I'm not trying to convince anybody to do anything. I'm only speaking from experience by saying that a lot of the things you worry about become less important or a lot easier to solve than you first thought just by virtue of how much you love your new child and how happy that child makes you.", "You understand what I'm trying to say, then.", "And when that first job is third shift in a hospital (that is where most nurses start out) it will be on the significant other to care for both children so hopefully he is aware of that.", " Nah, the 11 year old can skip school to watch the baby... good practice, right?\n\n/s", "He just got custody. Kids need time to feel comfortable in a new home. Anyone would. Also, it's very easy for the guy who wouldn't be dealing with most of it to say that its doable.

It\u2019s extremely hard, takes counseling, and kids still struggle feeling \u201cstuff\u201d. I\u2019ve blended,  and my 25 yo still sometimes thinks his SD only loves his own blood son. Not for any legit reason. My DH raised all the kids with the same rules, same love. But my sons feelings are valid, and something we devote attention to helping him work through and assuring him via words and actions we love him equally. It\u2019s a tad naive to say an 11 yo won\u2019t be impacted by the birth of a half sibling. In hind site, I would have raised my first set before remarrying. Blending is hard. Disable, but very hard.", "Imagine reading the context provided", "Where did I say literally anything about wanting to or feeling obligated - or really, feeling any way at all - about those things? Where did I say literally anything about the child being an inconvenience or work? You're straight up making things up at this point. \n\nSpecifically, you're still acting like the emotion of the situation is all that matters. As though as long as you're happy about staying home from work when the kid is sick, it doesn't matter that you're losing out on your income for those days. As though as long as you're happy about staying up all night with the baby, your body won't need sleep and your mind will be capable of studying whether you slept or not.\n\nThe emotion, how someone feels about their kid, is beside the point here. There are pragmatic realities that come with having a kid, and being happy and loving your child doesn't magically make those go away. So advising someone \"don't worry about whether you can afford a kid or can handle parenting rn, as long as you love the kid it'll all just work itself out\" is, as previously stated, useless advice. That's how you wind up with parents who weren't ready and can't give their kid the attention or support the kid needs, bc they let themselves get swept up by the emotions and didn't consider the practicalities.", "I am certain that he will believe his eleven year old daughter should be a mini mom rather than him lift a finger.", "Did I slip into a Duggar family thread?", "My wife and I both come from broken homes and have made a vow of no step parents for our boys to one another. Fortunately her and I are very happily married, which makes the vow significantly easier to adhere to. I understand the difficulties of blended families, but it does sound as though they were always planning to have a child together at some point, and my perspective is now better than later. I didn't say an 11 year old wouldn't be impacted, only that the impact can and most likely will be positive.", "I mean, a year-ish to be pregnant and then maternity leave..... his daughter will probably be 13! The perfect age to step up and watch her baby sibling when she isn't in school. \n\nBoth of these females can just handle it! No need for ol' boy to lift a finger", "Doubt that the impact would be positive at all.\n\nWhat happened in the home with the kid's mother that led to custody being changed? Abuse? Death? Neglect? Did mother just decide she wasn't primary caregiver anymore? All of those will leave a kid with mental scarring and feelings of abandonment. \n\nShe's just moved into a new house, with new rules, new parent figures, and now her father is talking about (in her eyes) replacing her with a newer model and dumping them both with a step mother who is already busy with studying a nursing degree.\n\nI've known several nurses at university, that degree isn't a joke. She isn't sitting around twiddling her thumbs to wait on children hand and foot. She's busy with long classes, multiple assignments, hospital placements, exams, and so much more.\n\nEven if it's a year before the baby arrived, it's not the physical crying baby that will instil the resentments and feelings of replacement. The child is 11, and absolutely understands enough about pregnancy to know what will be happening during that year.\n\nIf her father already wants to palm off the raising onto his fiance, what makes you think he'll try to foster a good relationship with his 11 year old child so they don't feel abandoned and unloved? He has a very cavalier attitude towards people's feelings already, I wouldn't trust his judgement in thus situation."]}
