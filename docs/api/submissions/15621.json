It\u2019s what has made me as a woman want to date outside of my culture because I am so afraid of falling into the exact same dynamic. \n\nThis is entirely cultural - we are *expected* to serve our elders even when they\u2019re wrong. And if we don\u2019t, then we get further grief. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to tell you, but from my experience this dynamic will never change. Your options are either to divorce him and move on with your life or continue to put up with the constant abuse until it breaks you down (all of the women I know in this situation are unfortunately so broken down after many years of this). \n\nPlease don\u2019t get me wrong, there are such beautiful aspects of the culture too and it\u2019s not all bad, nor is every family like this.

Time to schedule a lunch with your husband away from the house and talk this through. Calmly let him know this needs fixing before the baby comes. Lastly, take a weekend for yourself at a hotel in town. Unplug, relax and have some good sleep.", "Try setting up a nanny cam.

Tell your husband if he values you and his children then he must move her out to a small apartment or somewhere.  this situation is just awful to be so young and stuck with a MIL from hell.
