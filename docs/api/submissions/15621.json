He\u2019s seeing his mother acting as slave to MIL, he\u2019s seeing his mother be abused and by his fathr refusing to get involved, he is seeing his father condone the abuse of his mother. How do you think Son will behave to you, to your girls or to his future family if this is allowed to continue? \n\nHow much worse shall it be as your family ages and you aren\u2019t just outnumber 2:1, but 5:1? How will that work out for you or your children\u2019s future happiness? \n\nYou are being abused. Your husband is condoning that abuse. MIL will step it up. She\u2019s already escalating. She will continue to escalate once you\u2019ve given birth. So leave. Get your stuff together, get your boy and leave. Before you give birth. Before your vulnerability as a mother to newborn twins and toddler further traps you in this abusive environment. Leave\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA! \n\nGet that rat out of your house- grieving or not tell her to sod off. Don't care if her husband died- you're pregnant with twins so that's more important.\n\nYour husband also needs a kick up the arse for being so disrespectful to the mother of his kids buy letting his wench of a mother order you around and berate you like she does.", "NTA, but you have a husband problem more than you have a MIL problem. Your husband will always put her first. If you can't live with that, then you have a bigger problem than whether you're doing her laundry.", "NTA.\n\nNext time she is awful to you, leave. Go to a friends house, and tell your husband that you will come home when you are treated with respect by both him and his mother in your own home. If he can't make that happen, then he has to choose between being a mommas boy or being a married man.", "NTA. This stress can't be good for the babies. Unless your husband starts standing up for you his mother is never going to change. You are not married to just him. You are married to him and his mother. Do you have family you can go to? I don't see this ending in a good way and you will need to decide if you love him more than yourself. Your  physical and mental health are important and his mother is just constantly taking a hammer to them. Good luck.", "I'm thinking you need to be told by a solid western doctor that you need to be on bedrest and cannot lift more than ten pounds for the duration of your pregnancy.\n\nAlso, watching 'crazy rich Asians' constantly may help.", "You have a husband problem. NTA. If your MIL doesn\u2019t like the way you do anything, point to the cleaning supplies and tell her she is welcome to do it herself if she doesn\u2019t like how you do it. Same with cooking, laundry. In fact, I\u2019d tell your husband to get his mother to stop being such an AH to you, or he will find himself doing everything for himself too(laundry, meals, etc.). That this will be the last step before you dump him and his mother. You don\u2019t have one child with two futures on the way, you have three children and two future kids. Drop the excess weight", "NTA. Listen, you're young, and pregnant, and so I know what I'm going to say is going to sound scary to you:\n\nDivorce.\n\nYour husband is always going to be a momma's boy. He is always going to take her side over yours. You will cling on, trying to convince yourself he will eventually get better and see sense, but he never, never will. As long as you're married to this man, his mother will be living with you and mentally and emotionally torturing you. Leave now, while you are young and have the energy. When you are forty and your kids are teenagers or grown or you have more kids, things will be even harder. It will never get better.\n\nGood luck to you. I hope you listen.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband sure is.", "your husband is a dckhead and he got it from his mom\n\nNTA, do you have family nearby? go there until your husband remembers that you're pregnant with twins and have a toddler to take care off.. The mom can eat it!", "NTA but YTA to yourself. Leave your husband and let him live with his mother as that is what he wants. Until you have your husband respect you, you will never have your MIL respect you. You do not deserve any of this and if your husband loves you like he should he will come around real quick. I am so sorry you are dealing with this while pregnant but MIL has to go.", "NTA. Also, it\u2019s partly a cultural thing I\u2019m afraid - south Asian mother in laws have a reputation for treating their daughter in laws really badly. The whole point is to make you feel less than and not worthy for their precious son.", "NTA. When she berates you for anything, remind her that one day she\u2019ll be with her husband again and you\u2019ll both be happy.", "NTA And honestly you deserve someone who has your back", "YTA for not kicking this woman out of your house! This is your house and you have every right to have only the people living in it that you both agree to. Somebody living in your house is a two-yes situation and she clearly has a no from you! Tonight when your husband gets home from work, sit down and tell him mother-in-law has got to go.\n\nOh and info... How old is this woman?", "Honestly OP, I would leave. Let your husband deal with mommy dearest. You need to take care of yourself and those babies. \nYou\u2019re NTA.", "He is letting his mother mentally abuse his very pregnant wife and treat her like a slave. Husband is bad news. He , doesn't respect OP at all. And I know this is such a reddit cliche, but the age difference? Mind you, if a couple meet at 21 and 27 it would be one thing, but considering he got her pregnant at 18 when he was 24, I wonder how young she was when they met. And he is clearly taking advantage of the power balance by forcing OP to take in his mother and be their live-in maid.", "He will never want to upset his mother and you and the children will suffer for it. My Mom lived that for 40 years, she's still bitter.", ">He's upsets and thinks I should be putting more effort in mending the relationship with his mom especially because she is still grieving.  \n>  \n>My husband (27) insisted that we have his mom move in with us due to her losing her husband (6 month prior) and older age.  \n>  \n>I'm from another culture than her and grew up in the west while she is south Asian.\n\nNTA but you need to divorce immediately OP because I am telling you right now that she is never leaving that house **EVER.**", "Don\u2019t give your life away to this ok. Cut yourself loose. Let him and the old girl raise those kids \n\nDon\u2019t bend over backwards for her. She doesn\u2019t get special meals. Laugh when she says it and be like - I hear a lot of complaints and not a lot of anything else. \n\nWould you like my husband to yourself? You can raise these kids with him if you keep yappin", "Don\u2019t leave. Just start harnessing all the pregnancy hormones into a focused beam of brimstone and fire and let it rain down upon her.", "If you have family in the area, go stay with them. This is not the ideal situation for you while pregnant.", "Is there a way to move out and stay with supportive friends or family? Otherwise, this will be your life forever. No support from your husband or MIL, and constant denigration from both. They will teach your children to dishonor and disrespect you. Your life is miserable and will only get worse.\n\nYour husband has shown you that he doesn\u2019t care about you, only his mother. Please believe him.", "Why\u2019d you marry into this culture before making sure your husband was going to respect you and have boundaries with his parents?     \n\nYou have a husband and MIL who are SE Asian stereotypes.    There\u2019s a million stories of them treating daughters in law this way, even if they are from their own culture!    \n\nWhat a mess!    Your husband is the problem, and until he learns to stand up to his own mother, nothing will get better for you.   \n\nYou should do some more research and understand what you\u2019re dealing with.    Have you been to /r/desis or /r/JustNoMIL ?", "That\u2019s it. Stage a strike.", "I absolutely agree with this \n\nIt will truly show the husband how bad things are, the consequences, and show how much he actually cares for OP.\n\nSome people really do need something big to have sense slapped into them, but if that doesn't happen, at least it will give OP an answer, which is better to have sooner rather than later\n\nI'd also advise to keep MILs toxicity away from the kids so they don't learn anything TBH"]}
