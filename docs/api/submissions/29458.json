They both work very long hours 7 days a week, as they're both workaholics (we're talking 80+ hours each) and they've been like this for the 7 years they've been together. \n\nWhen I asked who is going to work less, my friend said they're going to hire a live-in nanny to take care of their child while they work all day. They make around $200k-$250k a year together, and could easily spend less time working given how much money they have saved. When I asked how much time they expected to spend with their child, he said he'd probably get around 1-2 hours a day, and that neither of them liked the idea of changing diapers or waking up at night to take care of the baby, so they'd be happy to pay the nanny to essentially be the 24/7 caregiver.\n\nAs a father, I was taken aback. Part of being a parent is quite literally taking care of your child. Poopy diapers, tantrums, BEING THERE. I asked how his child would feel growing up without his/her parents, and he asked what I meant. I told him he's not a really a parent if he rarely ever sees his child and never actually does anything a parent does. Just because your wife gave birth and you happened to be the reason she had a baby doesn't make you parents, it's the act of being a parent that makes you a parent.\n\nHe got really upset with me and hasn't talked to me much all week, and his wife has been posting passive aggressively on Facebook since the day I said it, but I really dont feel like I'm in the wrong. They act like they want to be parents but would rather pay someone else to do all the work?

My parents both worked full-time when I was a kid. They were usually gone like 11-12 hours a day. We had an extra basement bedroom so their childcare solution was live-in babysitters who got a smaller paycheck and room and board (which wound up being cheaper than other options). \n\nMy parents 100% raised us. We spent a couple hours together on weeknights, but always had dinner together. We spent weekends together. Our family is super close. The babysitters were like fun bonus adults. \n\nDon\u2019t judge other people\u2019s parenting decisions. You make the ones you want. Other people can make the ones they want.

There is a lot of you out there.", "YTA.\n\nI disagree with you. I think it is possible to be a good parent even with a live-in nanny. It is certainly *possible* to check-out as a parent when you have a full-time nanny, but think of it as a risk rather than a certainty.\n\nBut where I think you really blew it is in how you described your friend's idea. Using phrases like the child \"growing up without his/her parents\" and \"not really a parent\" and \"never actually does anything a parent does\" \u2014 those are all crazy over the top! You sound as if your friend was planning to send the infant to boarding school at age zero. Bullshit. This is where you crossed the line.\n\nIn addition, many people use fantasies of \"nanny forever\" to get over their fear and uncertainty about having a child. *Maybe* they would end up having a full-time nanny forever. Equally likely that one of them would decide to stay home. Or maybe when the kid is in school they'll have a part-time Nanny to over that awkward time when school is done but work isn't yet done. (What a horrible system we have in the US.)\n\nNext time mind your own business, or at least be much more gentle in your language. You might consider asking questions rather than insulting your friend.", "NTA", "NTA OP.

You have no idea what's going to happen, how they'll react  once the baby arrives, the potential if they'll retire early so they can raise their child full-time, etc.  It's no different if someone commented on you being a bad parent before you even actually had a child - I doubt seriously that you would have appreciated it whatsoever.", "I worked with a woman who only saw her child in the evening since she and her husband both worked crazy hours (they had a nanny).  \n\nOne day she had a funny story for me! She was hanging out with the munchkin who asked her \"Where does Daddy live?\"   She thought it was hilarious. I thought it was heartbreaking.\n\nI agree with your viewpoint, but it wasn't really your place to say it.", "NTA it doesn't sound like these people actually want to be parents so much as they're just checking something off on their \"successful people have..\" list.

We were her family, her parents barely knew her.", "Yta", "That baby will love the nanny more unless specifically taught to look down on the help.", "YTA. Not your family. This kind of thing is less common now but used to be almost universal. My mother's parents had a live in for her and her two siblings, and were absolutely still fully involved in their lives. It's fine to disagree but if they're making sure the kids have everything they need you have no place to cast that kind of judgement.", "YTA. I know people who have nannies even though it costs almost one of their salaries to pay for. Thing is nanny is for a short time - 2 to 3 years and then child in nursery  etc. If both parents have careers and are progressing well, then they might have enough income for one to stay home but the income foregone is not just the current income but promotions they lose by being out the workforce. That higher income pays for child's schooling, education and holidays. They are parents who are considering child longterm as well as being there in the moment.\n\nAnd a lot of parents have children in childcare because they need both incomes to survive. It doesn't make them less valid as parents. Your situation is unusual in that you have four intensive days on and three days off. So some else is parenting your child the other days - your spouse? Do you ever feel less good as a partner because all your time is devoted to your child and never to each other?", "Yta so people are not parents when their kids go to school?   Or when their kids go to daycare?  \n\nAre you a SAHP?  Why not? Don't you love your child? Don't you want to be a *real* parent?  Clearly, you're a lesser parent bc you're gone for 40 hours a week.  See how that sounds?", "YTA. Quit judging people. For all you know, having a full time nanny might make them BETTER parents because they don't have to deal with all the drudgery.\n\nEveryone is raised differently, but you had to be the  sanctimonious jerk who thinks only their way is acceptable. And not only think it, but scold your friend for having a different view.", "ESH most people just have to work full time now and can\u2019t afford a stay at home parent. Even if they earn a lot, their mortgage etc might also be very high. They\u2019re AH\u2019s for thinking they only need to see their child an hour a day.", "YTA. Gatekeeping parenthood is obnoxious. \n\nDid you know that mothers who give birth by C-section are still mothers? Same thing. \n\nBy your definition how are \"parents\" who are away as active military are parents at all?

They will learn the hard way, many times over", "For me, I'm going to go with ESH for this reason.... I agree with you on the issue and think you are completely correct. However, it is none of your business. That is where YTA. It's not your place to comment on how they raise their child. As long as that child is well cared for, fed, loved, etc.. then stay out of it. You came across as very judgemental. There are a lot of different family dynamics out there.

Employing a 3rd party to raise your kid (I have nothing against nannies or childcare, I used childcare myself) to the extent they don't even want to be parents at all, even in their off time is concerning. The child will bond more with the caregiver and once the caregiver is eventually replaced, will have abandonment/trust issues. Children aren't trophies are require tons of attention, love, and work.", "YTA. If you're a parent then you know that unsolicited opinions aren't welcome when it comes to parenting.

A live in nanny doesn't mean your friend won't be a good parent.", "YTA. You are waaay to judgemental.  Everyone parents differently", "YTA. I am shocked by the N T As. You said a totally assholish thing to a person you claim to care about, who, in no discernible way, prompted you, insulted you, or forced you to give your opinion here. You told him he will be a bad parent, completely unprompted. YTA. Perhaps that is your opinion, but giving unsolicited opinions and judgments to people sometimes makes you an asshole. So here we are. \n\nMore so, you're already clearly judging him for working too much, (and possibly you're jealous at how much money they make) so sure, why not judge him for his completely hypothetical plans that might not even come to fruition to boot. You should also know that for many working parents it's not about the money -- many families end up spending more than an entire salary on childcare but it's worth it because taking any time off is a massive career hit. If I took even a year off in my field, I can pretty much kiss my entire career goodbye. \n\nThis is the problem with how people see parenting these days, it's a complete overcorrection from parents being super uninvolved back in the day, to absolutely *everything* is about your kids. Parents are not their own independent human beings anymore, they exist as nothing but caregivers to children. Stop judging parents who do things differently. If someone wants to hire around the clock nannies (it will have to be a nannies plural) to change poopy diapers, so they can spend the time they have actually playing and bonding with their children, there's nothing wrong with that. I assume that if they had no interest in spending time with their children, they wouldn't be considering having any. You're just upset/jealous/judgmental, pick your favorite, that they actually allow themselves the option of choosing how to spend their time with their kids. \n\nYou don't like the idea of being the kind of parent who pays someone else to change diapers while you play and bond with the baby. Cool, you don't have to be that parent. I'm sure a lot of people don't like the idea of being the kind of parent who is tired and struggling because they're up all night dealing with feedings, never have time to themselves, and possibly also having that take a toll on their marriage.", "YTA for judging them.\n\nIf they intended to neglect the child, then you might have a point, but just because they don't want to change shitty diapers doesn't make them lesser people.", "YTA.

They both work very long hours 7 days a week, as they're both workaholics (we're talking 80+ hours each) and they've been like this for the 7 years they've been together. \n\nWhen I asked who is going to work less, my friend said they're going to hire a live-in nanny to take care of their child while they work all day. They make around $200k-$250k a year together, and could easily spend less time working given how much money they have saved. When I asked how much time they expected to spend with their child, he said he'd probably get around 1-2 hours a day, and that neither of them liked the idea of changing diapers or waking up at night to take care of the baby, so they'd be happy to pay the nanny to essentially be the 24/7 caregiver.\n\nAs a father, I was taken aback. Part of being a parent is quite literally taking care of your child. Poopy diapers, tantrums, BEING THERE. I asked how his child would feel growing up without his/her parents, and he asked what I meant. I told him he's not a really a parent if he rarely ever sees his child and never actually does anything a parent does.

You're basically the babysitter at that point so the actual parent, the nanny, can go get rest/do things. \n\nIt sounds to me like they're in love with the idea of a child but don't want any of the \"messy parts\", and if you can't handle being there for the hard parts of having a child, you shouldn't be planning to have one. \n\nWhat if one of them loses their job, becomes injured/ill, or even ends up in a lethal accident? What if something happens that causes them to lose their money? How do they plan on caring for a child they have no intention of learning how to care for in the first place? It's just irresponsible.

It sounds like they don\u2019t really want to parent so what is exactly the point?", "I\u2019m surprised they aren\u2019t using a surrogate too,  so wifey doesn\u2019t have all the unpleasant things that can go on during a pregnancy or have to take maternity leave cause I \u2018m pretty she\u2019s not going to feel like going back to work right away after birth.", "Yeah there\u2019s a huge difference between working 40 hours per week and having a nanny help out vs working 80 hours per week and having a nanny actually raise your child.", "I came to say the same thing. Having a nanny is a parenting decision and is ok but to say you will only speen 1 to 2 hours a day with your child is insane.", "This is how parenting worked in rich families 3-4 generations ago. Everyone seems to have turned out fine (if rather arrogant and supremely confident of their place at the top of the world)", "I spend 2 hours a day with her mon-wed, then have about 8 hours thursday through saturday, and I spend all day sunday with her where I take her on daddy daughter dates, on adventures, and teach her whatever I can that coincides with her current learning level. \n\nI am as involved as possible, and while I dont expect that from every parent in the world, I would expect a parent to want to spend time with their child especially if they have ample opportunity to do so.", "The criticized friend didn't want to do overnight painting either. Especially with a newborn, many of the hours spent with a child are overnight hours.", "Exactly, what\u2019s the point?", "He\u2019s not planning on spending the weekends together, he\u2019s planning on working", "It's almost like you didn't read the post where both parents work 80 hours a week and only planning on spending 1-2 hours a day with the child.\n\nThey're also not planning on doing any of the actual parenting activities involved in caring for a child.", "Nah, spending 2 hours max per day with your kid, not handling tantrums, late nights, or diapers is not parenting. You\u2019re just roommates with you kid at that point.", "My parents were the same way, and for the most part my grandma watched us until we were older. But my parents were still active participants in my life, who didn\u2019t avoid changing my diapers and doing other \u201cinconvenient\u201d things. A live-in nanny is a good idea for two working parents, but it sounds like OP\u2019s friends plan to barely be there. Some nannies end up doing *everything*. My grandmother was raised by her nanny; her mother did nothing, just saw her occasionally, but wasn\u2019t really there. A parent should be there for the good and the bad, not just the good.", "Dude, back off. This guy isn't talking about your parents, which you seem to think he is. He's talking about his friend, who literally \\*ADMITTED\\* he only wanted to spend 1-2 hours a day with his potential child. It's very clear that this guy isn't looking for a \"bonus adult\", he is, at best, going to BE a \"bonus\" to his child.", "Having a nanny isn\u2019t the issue, these people seem entirely disinterested in being parents in general. Sure your kids are in daycare while you\u2019re at work but I\u2019m assuming you and your partner take care of your kids once you\u2019re all home together. You get more than 1-2 hours a day with them, especially when you consider weekends. OP said his friend and wife don\u2019t even plan to change diapers.", "Having a nanny isn't the problem. Not wanting to do any parenting and just wanting to be a fun parent/basically roommate with your child is. Only wanting to see your own child for 1-2hrs/day and not wanting to do the actual parenting has nothing to do with being a parent, it's just producing an offspring.", "He did ask what I thought as I'm the only parent he knows other than his brother whom he doesn't speak with, and I told him my exact opinion on it. \n\nHe's a very stubborn person and hasn't changed since I've met him several years ago, and as I've said, he's very addicted to work. Openly talks about how dumb it was I took time off work to go to ultrasound appointments when my fiance was pregnant, how I should spend more time working rather than raising my daughter since I'm the man of the house, etc. \n\nI hope his opinion changes, but the fact he's giving me the cold shoulder over this seems ridiculous since he's the once that asked my opinion.", "The friend actively asked for OP's opinion as he's the only parent the friend knows...", "\"I'm only gonna spend 1 to 2 hours a day 7 days a week with my kid\"  so between 7 and 14 hours out of each week however Absolutely makes you not a parent, at best you're a babysitter.  Hell many babysitters spend more time with their regular kids/clients then that.", "I love taking care of my daughter and spending time with her, she knows me as her father and we've spent countless hours on weekdays and weekends bonding and doing things together. I'm extremely patient and unbothered by tantrums, poopy diapers, and common mishaps that come along with having a young child, and helping my daughter through tough times only strengthens our bond.\n\nI feel as if their child is going to be closer to their nanny than them, and they're choosing to spend less time with their child for money they don't need. They both love to work, and it's almost all they do. They can afford to buy their child anything he/she wants, but is that what a child would choose if given the chance to spend time with their parents?", "Read the whole ting friend asked OP what his thoughts were on this arrangement. He gave an honest answer.", "He was asked his opinion though...", "In my experience it made more sense financially for me to stay home with our baby. Daycare is ridiculously expensive, it cost more than I\u2019d make in a month. I didn\u2019t see a point in working just to pay for daycare.", "He was asked his opinion...", "But it wasn't unsolicited if you read OP's comments.  This friend asked his opinion since OP and his brother are the only men he knew with kids and he wasn't speaking to his brother.", "They did ask", "So he\u2019d probably get her 1-2hrs a day and you spend 2hrs a day with her and you\u2019re judging him. And if you\u2019re getting 8hrs a day during the week then they\u2019re not school aged. Is gonna be even less if they\u2019re doing extracurricular activities after school.\n\nIt still seems hypocritical.", "and his plan for when his wife is pregnant is to what? hope she doesn't divorce him when he's unwilling to do Anything for her because \"well you could do it yourself.\"  Your friend seems to have failed to recognize that kids aren't instant there is kind of the actual pregnancy to deal with as well.", "I missed the part where he said the friend asked.", "Look, all of that *may* become true, but right now you're treating a purely hypothetical situation as if it as reality and judging them for something that hasn't even happened. The non-AH way of talking about this is to talk about what makes parenthood special *in your experience,* and pointing out that if they decide to use a nanny, it'll take care to find the right balance.", "YTA. Some people aren\u2019t good with babies and are better with teenagers.\n\nWho the fuck are you to call someone less of a parent bc they want something different for their family than you do?! \n\nOh and currently, you\u2019re a hypocrite bc you\u2019re not \u201chome\u201d and spending twenty million hours with your kid either since you work and are in school. \n\nNot to mention, people fucking change once they meet their kid. Just bc they say that now, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll stick. He could end up being a better dad than YOU. And for THAT, YOU are an asshole friend and what you said to him absolutely shitty. Go apologize.", "Yes that\u2019s a factor too. Especially if you have multiple kids too small for school.", "Op only does three days a week with only 1-2 hours. Then 8 hours for three and a whole day for one. You want to compare that to 1-2 hours everyday a week? Thats insane. Op spends 30 hours a week with his child not including sunday. While the friend would spend 14 tops for the whole.", "Did you even read OP'S response?", "He is only seeing he for two hours twice a week and it\u2019s only until he is out of school himself so probably before the child starts school or not long after she starts. I\u2019m sure he would love to spend more time with her but he is doing it to better their lives, the friend only wants to see their child two hours a day EVERYDAY and it\u2019s not to better the child\u2019s life it\u2019s just because they don\u2019t want to give up work hours even tho he makes more than enough money and the dude doesn\u2019t even want to do anything a parent does he wants to say he is a parent but do none of the work that comes with being one. He is incredibly selfish and it\u2019s disgusting. The fact that you think these situations are in anyway similar is beyond crazy.", "No he does not get 2 hours a day.  Thats only for 3 days a week. Then 8 hours a day another 3 days and then all day the last day. That is much more than 1-2 hours for all 7 days.", "Everyone pointed out the obvious that OP only does that a few days a week, but you're missing the point that OP isn't doing this by choice and their friends absolutely would be. OP does this out of necessity, and you're an asshole to compare these", "They skimmed it then doubled down."]}
