They make around $200k-$250k a year together, and could easily spend less time working given how much money they have saved. When I asked how much time they expected to spend with their child, he said he'd probably get around 1-2 hours a day, and that neither of them liked the idea of changing diapers or waking up at night to take care of the baby, so they'd be happy to pay the nanny to essentially be the 24/7 caregiver.\n\nAs a father, I was taken aback. Part of being a parent is quite literally taking care of your child. Poopy diapers, tantrums, BEING THERE. I asked how his child would feel growing up without his/her parents, and he asked what I meant. I told him he's not a really a parent if he rarely ever sees his child and never actually does anything a parent does. Just because your wife gave birth and you happened to be the reason she had a baby doesn't make you parents, it's the act of being a parent that makes you a parent.\n\nHe got really upset with me and hasn't talked to me much all week, and his wife has been posting passive aggressively on Facebook since the day I said it, but I really dont feel like I'm in the wrong. They act like they want to be parents but would rather pay someone else to do all the work?

My parents both worked full-time when I was a kid. They were usually gone like 11-12 hours a day. We had an extra basement bedroom so their childcare solution was live-in babysitters who got a smaller paycheck and room and board (which wound up being cheaper than other options). \n\nMy parents 100% raised us. We spent a couple hours together on weeknights, but always had dinner together. We spent weekends together. Our family is super close. The babysitters were like fun bonus adults. \n\nDon\u2019t judge other people\u2019s parenting decisions. You make the ones you want. Other people can make the ones they want.

There is a lot of you out there.", "YTA.\n\nI disagree with you. I think it is possible to be a good parent even with a live-in nanny. It is certainly *possible* to check-out as a parent when you have a full-time nanny, but think of it as a risk rather than a certainty.\n\nBut where I think you really blew it is in how you described your friend's idea. Using phrases like the child \"growing up without his/her parents\" and \"not really a parent\" and \"never actually does anything a parent does\" \u2014 those are all crazy over the top! You sound as if your friend was planning to send the infant to boarding school at age zero. Bullshit. This is where you crossed the line.\n\nIn addition, many people use fantasies of \"nanny forever\" to get over their fear and uncertainty about having a child. *Maybe* they would end up having a full-time nanny forever. Equally likely that one of them would decide to stay home. Or maybe when the kid is in school they'll have a part-time Nanny to over that awkward time when school is done but work isn't yet done. (What a horrible system we have in the US.)\n\nNext time mind your own business, or at least be much more gentle in your language. You might consider asking questions rather than insulting your friend.", "NTA", "NTA OP.

You have no idea what's going to happen, how they'll react  once the baby arrives, the potential if they'll retire early so they can raise their child full-time, etc.  It's no different if someone commented on you being a bad parent before you even actually had a child - I doubt seriously that you would have appreciated it whatsoever.", "I worked with a woman who only saw her child in the evening since she and her husband both worked crazy hours (they had a nanny).  \n\nOne day she had a funny story for me! She was hanging out with the munchkin who asked her \"Where does Daddy live?\"   She thought it was hilarious. I thought it was heartbreaking.\n\nI agree with your viewpoint, but it wasn't really your place to say it.", "NTA it doesn't sound like these people actually want to be parents so much as they're just checking something off on their \"successful people have..\" list.

We were her family, her parents barely knew her.", "Yta", "That baby will love the nanny more unless specifically taught to look down on the help.", "YTA. Not your family. This kind of thing is less common now but used to be almost universal. My mother's parents had a live in for her and her two siblings, and were absolutely still fully involved in their lives. It's fine to disagree but if they're making sure the kids have everything they need you have no place to cast that kind of judgement.", "YTA. I know people who have nannies even though it costs almost one of their salaries to pay for. Thing is nanny is for a short time - 2 to 3 years and then child in nursery  etc. If both parents have careers and are progressing well, then they might have enough income for one to stay home but the income foregone is not just the current income but promotions they lose by being out the workforce. That higher income pays for child's schooling, education and holidays. They are parents who are considering child longterm as well as being there in the moment.\n\nAnd a lot of parents have children in childcare because they need both incomes to survive. It doesn't make them less valid as parents. Your situation is unusual in that you have four intensive days on and three days off. So some else is parenting your child the other days - your spouse? Do you ever feel less good as a partner because all your time is devoted to your child and never to each other?", "Yta so people are not parents when their kids go to school?   Or when their kids go to daycare?  \n\nAre you a SAHP?  Why not? Don't you love your child? Don't you want to be a *real* parent?  Clearly, you're a lesser parent bc you're gone for 40 hours a week.  See how that sounds?", "YTA. Quit judging people. For all you know, having a full time nanny might make them BETTER parents because they don't have to deal with all the drudgery.\n\nEveryone is raised differently, but you had to be the  sanctimonious jerk who thinks only their way is acceptable. And not only think it, but scold your friend for having a different view.", "ESH most people just have to work full time now and can\u2019t afford a stay at home parent. Even if they earn a lot, their mortgage etc might also be very high. They\u2019re AH\u2019s for thinking they only need to see their child an hour a day.", "YTA. Gatekeeping parenthood is obnoxious. \n\nDid you know that mothers who give birth by C-section are still mothers? Same thing. \n\nBy your definition how are \"parents\" who are away as active military are parents at all? These people would be far more directly involved than them. \n\nWhat they're doing isn't abuse. It isn't (necessarily) neglect. It's just different than you. But this made you feel important, huh?", "Info: Why are you a part of his parenting plan?  \n\n\nI'm getting a lot of downvotes but no one is disagreeing with what I say.", "They can't even afford that amount of care, nor will.they find someone to work that many hours. They'll need two nannies, and they're going to be paying 120k give or take.", "YTA. People parent differently, according to their circumstances. This is one time when saying less may have been a better call", "ESH.  Mind your own business, but yeah your friends sound like idiots.", "YTA--and a rude, judgmental one, at that.", "NTA.  They will learn the hard way, many times over", "[deleted]", "YTA. my mom had a live in nanny cause she had 4 kids and my dad was an international business man. sometimes you just need help. and this is a hypothetical. they could absolutely change their minds once they actually have the kid. no one asked for your opinion either", "YTA.

It isn't your place to tell your friends how to parent despite your concerns. Celebrities and other people in high-profile, high-demand jobs parent this way. I'm not saying I approve of it, but it isn't your decision to make. On the other hand, your friend and his wife are selfish and unrealistic. Employing a 3rd party to raise your kid (I have nothing against nannies or childcare, I used childcare myself) to the extent they don't even want to be parents at all, even in their off time is concerning. The child will bond more with the caregiver and once the caregiver is eventually replaced, will have abandonment/trust issues. Children aren't trophies are require tons of attention, love, and work.", "YTA. If you're a parent then you know that unsolicited opinions aren't welcome when it comes to parenting.

And finally, if you're a parent you know 90% of plans you make/expectations you have before being a parent change once the kiddo is here.\n\nNot your circus, not your monkeys. Back off.", "YTA and MYOFB,  I don\u2019t know that I believe this is real. But if it is \u2026 Did he ask for your opinion?", "Yta. Myob. A live in nanny doesn't mean your friend won't be a good parent.", "YTA. You are waaay to judgemental.  Everyone parents differently", "YTA. I am shocked by the N T As. You said a totally assholish thing to a person you claim to care about, who, in no discernible way, prompted you, insulted you, or forced you to give your opinion here. You told him he will be a bad parent, completely unprompted. YTA. Perhaps that is your opinion, but giving unsolicited opinions and judgments to people sometimes makes you an asshole. So here we are. \n\nMore so, you're already clearly judging him for working too much, (and possibly you're jealous at how much money they make) so sure, why not judge him for his completely hypothetical plans that might not even come to fruition to boot. You should also know that for many working parents it's not about the money -- many families end up spending more than an entire salary on childcare but it's worth it because taking any time off is a massive career hit. If I took even a year off in my field, I can pretty much kiss my entire career goodbye. \n\nThis is the problem with how people see parenting these days, it's a complete overcorrection from parents being super uninvolved back in the day, to absolutely *everything* is about your kids. Parents are not their own independent human beings anymore, they exist as nothing but caregivers to children. Stop judging parents who do things differently. If someone wants to hire around the clock nannies (it will have to be a nannies plural) to change poopy diapers, so they can spend the time they have actually playing and bonding with their children, there's nothing wrong with that. I assume that if they had no interest in spending time with their children, they wouldn't be considering having any. You're just upset/jealous/judgmental, pick your favorite, that they actually allow themselves the option of choosing how to spend their time with their kids. \n\nYou don't like the idea of being the kind of parent who pays someone else to change diapers while you play and bond with the baby. Cool, you don't have to be that parent. I'm sure a lot of people don't like the idea of being the kind of parent who is tired and struggling because they're up all night dealing with feedings, never have time to themselves, and possibly also having that take a toll on their marriage.", "YTA for judging them.\n\nIf they intended to neglect the child, then you might have a point, but just because they don't want to change shitty diapers doesn't make them lesser people.", "YTA.

That would be lovely right now.", "Exactly this", "its fucking ridiculous people are asking for sources on... parents wanting to parent?? on... its better for children to have a parent that actually wants them??? the people thinking op is an ah are... ill just say i got some popcorn ready reading those ridiculous things\ud83d\ude0b\ud83c\udf7f", "Domestic tasks like cooking and cleaning bring me little joy. I feel this is a fairly normal outlook. You do them because you have to. \n\nParenting brings me immense joy. What I am saying is that you have a narrow definition of what parenting is. \n\nUnfortunately it is very common among parents to rate their approach and dump on the approach of others.  It\u2019s almost a sport.", "Unfortunately, there is also quite a bit of that out there...", "Doctors are notoriously bad parents and partners so maybe that's not a good thing", "You know multiple people that have had kids saying that they won't even change a diaper?", "Yep, wouldn\u2019t be the first wealthy idiots who thought that\u2019s be appropriate to expect of one person.", "I know plenty of wonderful parents who are doctors. Kind of ridiculous to imply that that doctors shouldn\u2019t be parents", "Not that specific statement but yes that they plan to have full time childcare. I know several people that paid for night nurses, etc. so they didn\u2019t have to wake up at night or do feedings. Almost universally those plans changed almost immediately after their kids were born and they grew attached.", "Lol when did I say that? Just because they on average are terrible people with God complexes who don't spend time with their kids doesn't mean they should be parents /s", "That is different. Like I said no problem having a live in nanny. That is a parenting choice. But op said that they don't plan on changing 1 diaper. So I'm guessing during that 1 to 2 hours they are with their kids the nanny takes care of them while they are In the room. When I read the title I was inclined to disagree with op till I read it"]}
