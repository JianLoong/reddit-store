I mean, it\u2019s relevant, but if I got a bonus for preventing my coworkers from getting fair pay and benefits, I might keep that part to myself. It\u2019s like OP wants everyone to think he is TA. \n\nAlso, what kind of consulting does a former principal do? Do you get paid good money to tell other principals how to do their jobs? Do you mention the union busting?", "Nta. The coffee machine is his. It has nothing to do with the union thing", "We have a principal that is chasing teachers away. I did a hiring fair for our district recently... Our school had NO ONE while the other ones had tons of OUR teachers talking to hiring admins. Weird.  WEIRD.", "I meant for letting people use the machine.. But now that you mention it........ yeah. That little bit of detail slipped my mind. Switching my judgment.", "They would have gotten MORE than that through a union contract.", "Maybe they could all pitch in a little bit, it doesn't have to be a fancy machine. It was just a suggestion. Everyone could also bring their own from home.", "Not a gift. Just said they can use it. It\u2019s his.", "The people above the principal organized to prevent the \u201clower\u201d staff from doing the same and gaining any leverage.", "I agree good coffee machines are expensive but we have no idea what his definition of \"nice\" is, and based off how he stopped teachers from organizing I highly doubt he spent 5-10k for their benefit", "Meanwhile us broke teachers would definitely consider the $200 coffee maker to be the VERY nice option", "Agreeing that $200 sounded a little lowball, but damn, $10k, for coffee?   Get a barista too?", "I\u2019ll agree that $200 was probably far less than what he spent but I find it difficult to believe someone who worked to stop teachers from organizing was willing to spend $5,000 for a coffee machine for said teachers. This isn\u2019t someone who values his teachers. And if he did spend that much on a coffee machine, it\u2019s still a piss poor consolation prize.", "My husband would consider a Mr. Coffee from Goodwill a \u201cnice\u201d coffee machine.", "I\u2019m guessing he bought a Nespresso since he mentioned stocking it.  If it were a Keurig that thing wouldn\u2019t have lasted this long.", "Yeaaaah, you just made a huge assumption about the quality of the coffee machine\u2026\n\nAnd the cost of robbing those teachers of the ability to get paid for their work far outweighs a 50k coffee machine.", "How long ago did he buy the machine if it's been there for a long time. \n\n$200 for a machine may not be that high at the time that he purchased it. But yeah he's YTA  \n\nI wonder if his teachers know that he used money he got Union busting to provide them their coffee. \n\nThey may not want it anymore if they find out. In fact they may feel sickened if they find out.", "Not a consolation prize for the better quality of life he robbed his peers of.", "He's leaving for higher pay, and bought it with a work bonus. He should leave it for the folks he screwed over. YTA", "Me too! Jesus I feel horrible now for letting that simple detail slip through my stupid brain.", "He also \u201cdidn\u2019t need the money\u201d\u2026 then what was the point of preventing others from excercising their rights?!?!?", "A HUGE kickback. That's what he got as VP. Assuming others were paid, it seems likely that a teacher's full yearly salary was doled out", "I don\u2019t think anyone is thinking he\u2019s a rockstar when he was union busting. Asshole at both probably.", ">I don\u2019t see why he included that fact\n\nOn par for the same lack of awareness it takes to think that union busting is at all helpful or good. \n\nDude literally screwed his colleagues over and has the audacity to brag about it.", "It actually does", "Well, he bought the machine with money he got for the Union thing, so it isn\u2019t completely disconnected.", "No one wants to work any more, I tell ya.\n\nNo, seriously, I actually hear that line when it comes to taking *another* job.", "Exactly! But hey, he bought coffee!!!", "I'm inclined to believe it's more than likely an expensive coffee machine for two reasons: \n\n-He makes a thing of stipulating the amount of the bonus ($15,000) as if it's somehow relevant to the story. This would make sense since this context segues directly into him buying a 'nice' coffee machine. \n\n-It's crazy to me that someone would be wasting time on Reddit over a $200 coffee machine. I'm sure there are people who would do this... But it suddenly starts to make a lot more sense if you consider that it's a $5,000 coffee machine he's fighting over.", "Oh and yeah, dude, YTA here.", "I have a 200$ coffee machine. 17.99 from value village. 200$ coffee machines get turned in all the time. At the same time, I don't think 2g was spent on a machine for a break room.", "My mum's was $5,000 but there were dual pumps that went up to $10,000 and perhaps more. \n\nOne of the owners of a caf\u00e9 I was speaking to recently I think told me his were around $7,000.", "I'm not making that argument. I offered up some information on 'good' coffee machines. \n\nBut anything's possible and I'm shocked the dude's arguing on here about it is it's only $200.", "That's not my point though. \n\nI left another comment down below going through why it's likely an expensive coffee machine.", "Nespresso is cheap and makes OP's story that much more ridiculous that he's arguing over it on here. \n\nI remember buying a Nespresso machine years ago. And when I broke up with my girlfriend I just left it with her without even thinking about it.", "Mine was $700 and that was the price when I got it 10 years ago.\n\nBut still, leave the damn machine.  OP is a heartless admin.", "Yeaaaah, didn't make an assumption at all. Just stated a fact. \n\nYour attitude is lovely though.", "Don't feel bad, friend. It was intentionally phrased so that it *would* slip by people", "So there IS money for teachers. If they\u2019d only given the bonus money to the teachers in the first place, they might not have tried organizing.", "And OP is clear that they don\u2019t need the money.", "Yea, that\u2019s true.", "Nope.  The union thing is separate and not what\u2019s to be judged.", "Regardless that\u2019s not what we are judging it\u2019s completely separated from what hes asking.", "lol. Glad you said it. Its not the persuasive fact OP thinks it is.  I don\u2019t know what would be worse, if OP took the coffee and the coffee machine that everyone thought was there\u2019s or if OP MADE SURE that everyone knew that he bought and stocked the machine.", "He's an union buster. He saw other people gathering in an attempt to collectively bargain for their rights and did what he could to *stop them.*\n\nNever underestimate how petty someone like that can be.", "Yeah I was hoping I misinterpreted it", "There's money for *administrators* and main district office people.", "Yep. Most of the posts on this sub arent \"Is this legal\" its \"Am I morally the asshole\" and the answer here is a resounding yes. He mentioned squashing a teachers union *in* the post, and its what led to all of this, so its part of the context and therefore relevant to the situation. The machine is his, however as he was a massive AH by squashing the union attempt and got the coffee machine (which he states he bought for everyone btw) as a direct result, the least he could do is leave the machine. Taking it would make him an even bigger AH.", "So it was mentioned it\u2019s not important to be judged. He\u2019s an ass for it but that\u2019s not what this post is about. It\u2019s only about a coffee machine he was letting the school use for the time being. \n\nThough I\u2019m still a little iffy on unions considering my wife who works for a school tells me nothing but horror stories of absolutely terrible teachers being kept in their job due to the union.", "And the question is would he be an asshole for taking said coffee machine. Much like many of these posts, its not as black and white as \"the machine is his\". Pretty much all these posts give context and background so you can make a decision with what is hopefully a full picture from the posters pov. The context is important and the context here is that he bought the machine (by his own words, for everyone) with the money he got from crushing a teachers union. Its part of the story and therefore acceptable as part of the decision making irt to judgement, thats what context *does*.", "This is a black and white issue. It\u2019s his nta it\u2019s ok to be wrong."]}
