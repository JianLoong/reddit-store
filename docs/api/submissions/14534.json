{"id": 14534, "submission_id": "12ikoco", "title": "AITA for asking my neighbour to control her kid?", "selftext": "My (27 M) neighbour has a toddler of around 3-4 years. Whenever they head out of the house with him, he has got a tendency to walk towards our door and start banging his fist on it. Like, he'd just ram  at it while his parents ask him to stop. The issue is that he never listens to what they say, though.\n\nI'd been ignoring it for quite a while now, but today he started going at it again. It was even somewhat louder than before, and it finally started grating on my nerves. I opened the door to check what the matter was, but the boy then just left his parents to literally rush into my apartment. His mother had to take him out of the living room, while her husband was outside the house. They didn't apologise or anything, however, and were about to just walk away as if nothing had happened (they just gave me a smile as if he had pulled an innocent prank of sorts).\n\nI requested them to stop, and told his mother: \"I'm sorry, but please control your child. I don't want him ramming my door.\" They looked rather affronted, but his mother made excuses by saying that he never listens to them. But she promised to not let it happen again, and was about to move away when her husband forestalled her.\n\nHe was like \"I apologise for what he did, but couldn't you have saved that for later?\" I asked him what he meant, and he explained that it was insensitive of me to make such a comment when the child was present in front of us. He claimed that I could've talked to them about it in private, and that it was nothing urgent anyway. He argued that it's not as if he'd destroyed my property or anything. He then asked his child to apologise to me, which he did. The guy asked him to promise to not do that again, and he agreed to that too. All of that happened in front of me.\n\nIt sounded as if he were attempting to get the moral high-ground, and after that they went out as they were initially going to. It's left me in bad spirits as it wasn't my intention to hurt the child, I was just tired of how long it'd been going on. I asked my wife about it, and she seems to agree with what they claimed too. That I could've talked to them later. She also said I've got to be a little accommodating given his age.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681221420, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ikoco/aita_for_asking_my_neighbour_to_control_her_kid/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If this kid is a toddler and is already running the show, what will he be like as a teen?", "Wait, what do they think will happen if you speak to them without the kid present? At least this way, the child sees the consequences of his actions. I know 3 year olds can be nuts, but that\u2019s how they learn, by getting \u201cin trouble\u201d for their unacceptable behaviours.

It is completely unacceptable to allow your toddler to bang on peoples' doors, and run into their houses. You were completely in the right and there's nothing wrong with asking the parents in front of the kid to keep him from doing that. Parents like that give other parents a bad rep.\n\nIf it happens again, though, time to go to the property manager and file a formal complaint as you've addressed it with them already.", "NTA.\n\nThe child \"doesn't listen\" *probably* due to lack of discipline. You didn't \"hurt\" the child. If anything, saying it in front of the kid should make your request even more effective, because the kid is sensing your frustration. And if you did hurt the child's feelings, tough shit. That's life kid, get used to it. Coddling children does no favors to anyone. Now, unless you were yelling or physically acting out when speaking then yes, YTA, and your neighbor's are right.\n\nWith that being said, if this issue or another issue happens, the parents will be more receptive to you if you address them in private.

Kids that age are 100% capable of learning not to do something like that, and running into a strangers house without his parents is so dangerous!

NTA. \n\ni don't even think it was bad for you to say it in front of the child. children are smarter than people give them credit for, and they don't have to be shielded from when other adults don't think their behavior is okay. especially when it's about something simple, like manners that need to be taught when they're young.", "NTA.

What if you yourself were a violent person? \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to track them down later to talk to them privately because _you should not need to track them down at all._ They are adults, and _they_ know banging on strangers doors is not acceptable behavior.
