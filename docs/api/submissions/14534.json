Whenever they head out of the house with him, he has got a tendency to walk towards our door and start banging his fist on it. Like, he'd just ram  at it while his parents ask him to stop. The issue is that he never listens to what they say, though.\n\nI'd been ignoring it for quite a while now, but today he started going at it again. It was even somewhat louder than before, and it finally started grating on my nerves. I opened the door to check what the matter was, but the boy then just left his parents to literally rush into my apartment. His mother had to take him out of the living room, while her husband was outside the house. They didn't apologise or anything, however, and were about to just walk away as if nothing had happened (they just gave me a smile as if he had pulled an innocent prank of sorts).\n\nI requested them to stop, and told his mother: \"I'm sorry, but please control your child. I don't want him ramming my door.\" They looked rather affronted, but his mother made excuses by saying that he never listens to them. But she promised to not let it happen again, and was about to move away when her husband forestalled her.\n\nHe was like \"I apologise for what he did, but couldn't you have saved that for later?\" I asked him what he meant, and he explained that it was insensitive of me to make such a comment when the child was present in front of us. He claimed that I could've talked to them about it in private, and that it was nothing urgent anyway. He argued that it's not as if he'd destroyed my property or anything. He then asked his child to apologise to me, which he did. The guy asked him to promise to not do that again, and he agreed to that too. All of that happened in front of me.\n\nIt sounded as if he were attempting to get the moral high-ground, and after that they went out as they were initially going to. It's left me in bad spirits as it wasn't my intention to hurt the child, I was just tired of how long it'd been going on. I asked my wife about it, and she seems to agree with what they claimed too.
