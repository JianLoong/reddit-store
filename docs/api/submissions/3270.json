Most comments then somehow come back around and defend him in the end and you KNOW this because you reply to people. I understand life isn't as easy as dropping someone but are you doing anything to make your situation better. As of this post, did you end up apologizing to him for locking him out or did something else happen. I feel for you, I do, but I'm sorry, you need a backbone. Reddit is only a temporary fix for a pity party where you KNOW. AGAIN. That is isnt okay. Would you let someone treat your kids like this in the future?", "NTA. Your husband is entitled and can't respect one wish you had on YOUR BIRTHDAY. He was warned, he went ahead and did it. Also, why would it be weird for you TO GO OUT ON YOUR BIRTHDAY with friends, and him stay home? Because he doesn't feel like being a parent, or he hasn't grown up and still wants to hang with the 20 something's?", "NTA. But your husband is. Your friends are. Are any of them actually your friends? You need to find people who really care about you.", "NTA this is awful. I hope you don\u2019t do shit for his birthday and see how he likes it. Or maybe Saturday night get your friends together and leave without his permission to see how you like it. Except definitely none of these friends, they do not care about you as much as you thought", "Yikes, I'm so sorry your husband is so selfish.  you are not the asshole... but it sounds like you are married to one.  May want to rethink that part of your life.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband neither cares about nor respects you. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI can\u2019t believe not one of your so-called friends spoke up in the moment to say it\u2019s ridiculous to leave the birthday girl at home.", "After reading your post history your husband doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s getting any better. You are not the AH but he definitely is. What does he bring to the table?", "NTA it was your birthday. It was extremely selfish on his part. He needs to grow up.", "Your husband left you aline with your baby on your birthday? Wow. NTA. Your husbands selfishness is relationship destroying. He is failing you as a partner and is having you do all the heavy lifting in the care of the baby  even on your birthday. You have been doing this alone like a single mother. Sounds like your husband doesn\u2019t care about you and the baby", "Why are you with him? You deserve so much better. He sounds like he doesn't give a crap about you.", "Damn...you are married to a giant AH. NTA and wow...I'm just still shocked. Like, this doesn't require nuance. His behavior was just...textbook definition of a jerk.", "Well it would be weird for him to stay and actually look after the baby because this is clearly something he doesn't do much and it would be weird for him to be considerate because he doesn't do that either, exactly what did he do for your birthday? He should get up at least twice a week at night to look after the baby assuming you are at home all day at the moment. You guys need counselling so that he can work out how to be a decent partner and parent, otherwise you need to ask yourself whether single parenting would actually be worse. NTA", "NTA. Your husband and your friends sound like big pieces of sh**\u2026you deserve better than that especially on your birthday!!", "Then he should have stayed with you, cleaned up himself so you could sleep early...\nNot continued to celebrate YOUR BIRTHDAY, WITHOUT YOU!!!\n\nNTA", "And he cant be up for the baby either. Wife's duty huh? That's insane!", ">If thay is my friends birthday, I would at least organize a pot lock for her, she just had a baby and cook her own birthday dinner and cake? \n\nThis! Or, in the event that everyone's culinary skills are a little under-developed (as mine are), it would have been just as good to call in a food order for delivery, and insist on paper plates for everyone, to minimize the amount of cleanup... which everyone would tell OP, \"Go sit down and we will straighten up\" once the meal is through.\n\nWhat kind of GROUP of people makes the birthday person make all the food, bake their own flipping cake, and do all the cleanup? Four months after giving birth to a baby who doesn't sleep well, no less? A bunch of people who can all go scratch, that's who.", "even if I was a stranger invited to this sad party i wouldve loudly exclaimed \"WHAT? ARE WE JUST GOING TO ABANDON THE BIRTHDAY GIRL ON **HER** DAY?!?\" \n\nwhat a bunch of twisted, self-absorbed AH led by King AH himself.", "They all need to go take a flying feck at a rolling donut, is what they need.\n\nOP would be well rid of all of them, if this is how they regard her birthday. They couldn't even pool their money to call Uber Eats and a bakery, to spare OP all the cleanup? WTH?", "With friends and family like them who needs enemies..."]}
