It was your birthday. Of all days, he should be taking care of the baby so you could celebrate.", "NTA   \n\n\nHe already gets the side eye from me for not pulling his weight with the baby at night, but to coopt your birthday party, that he couldn't even be bothered to get you a cake for, and take your guests out to the bar while leaving you behind with the baby?  I would be livid in your place.  Locking the door behind him was literally the least you could do in that situation.", "NTA. His fault for being an ass and trying to dump the baby on you. He doesn\u2019t want any parental responsibilities. This is going to be a pattern op.", "NTA - WOW. Sorry you didn't realize what an ass your spouse is until after a baby was in the mix.", "NTA - your husband isn't helping you coparent, isn't respecting your feelings, and doesn't even do thoughtful things for you on your birthday. Why are you with him? There are red flags here, and he isn't going to change. Do you want your daughter to grow up feeling like you do now? When he takes her out for her \"birthday\" to do whatever he wants to do? It's a recipe for disaster and a lot of therapy.", "NTA he shouldn\u2019t be neglecting his parenting duties especially on your birthday.", "NTA your husband and friends are though", "GET ON BIRTH CONTROL, OP, or abstain from sex completely. \n\nIt\u2019s easier to be the single mom of 1 baby than it is 2. If it comes down to that.", "NTA. He's not fulfilling the bare minimum of his duties as a father and he's exploiting you by making you do all the childcare.", "Dude. I misread at first and thought it was HIS birthday you were celebrating and was still livid on your behalf. Then I realized it was actually YOUR birthday--! He couldn't prioritize you over a bar crawl with the boys -- and gals -- on the one day a year intended for only you???\n\nYou deserve a better husband and better friends, since not one of them spoke up on your behalf. Lock them ALL out.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. He should have either stayed home with you or made arrangements for a babysitter so you could go out too. He's full AH and totally self centered; there's nothing he can say to justify what he did. Any attempts to defend himself or be angry with you for locking him out, should be added to his list of crimes.  As of right now, he can explain himself to the judge in divorce court because he is not husband material.", "NTA.  They show up at 8 for dinner and appear already drunk.  You then have to cook your own birthday dinner and bake a cake. Then they all leave you to go to the bar?   At what point are the celebrating you?", "NTA. You need better friends and a better husband.", "Red flags on your husband", "NTA. I\u2019m shocked that you are still in this very one-sided relationship.", "NTA, it was your birthday and how would it be weird if you went out for drinks. You had already told your husband that you would like everyone to stay at your place and yet he still proposed the idea. His behavior was very rude towards you.", "Nta.", "NTA.

And WTF? \"I asked my husband if I could go and he stays home with the baby. But he says it would be weird.\"\n\nWhy would it be weird? You, getting to go out, with your friends, on your birthday? Why would that be weird? That sounds pretty normal to me.\n\nI mean, I suspect I know the answer. It's because it's your job, as the woman, to stay home like a good little wife and take care of baby. It's his job, as the man, to have fun and not do any childcare because that's women's work. Birthday or not. Is that why it would be weird?", "NTA. He seems a bit selfish. Best of luck.", "So his idea of celebrating his wife's birthday was to leave you alone to clean up while he went out with the boys?
