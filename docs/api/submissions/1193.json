That\u2019s some passive aggressive nonsense that\u2019s not helping anything. How about you just use your mouth and tell them it bothers you? If that doesn\u2019t work, get yourself a basket and put yourself one of everything in there and wash up your own things and they can deal with their own.

And you definitely don\u2019t need to clean up after them. You\u2019re all adults, and adults should be expected to keep up after ourselves and respect common living spaces at the very least. Plus, you didn\u2019t know which roommate(s) made the mess, so you couldn\u2019t have handled it privately, so I get it. I think throwing it in the group chat is the best option \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Sure, people could see it as passive-aggressive, but I\u2019d rather do that than be aggressive and confrontational, or passive and just clean the mess up myself or wait for it to be cleaned up (and I know how long that can take sometimes \ud83d\ude44).
