Wife and I were scheduled to leave town on Friday for a 6-day visit with family out of state. We asked our family friend, Jenna (15f), to help out with our dog and two cats while we're away. We love Jenna. She has babysat our kids for us and taken care of our cats while out of town before. This was to be a bigger job however, because we adopted a dog last year and now in addition to the checking on our cats, she would need to walk the dog a couple times a day and ostensibly give her some loving attention. Jenna asked for $150 for the week, which we happily agreed to - compared to a professional service, I acknowledge this is a total steal. Also, I like paying kids in the neighborhood versus hiring out to a company, just feels better in my opinion.\n\nHere's the issue: our youngest daughter, just tonight (Wednesday), claimed to be feeling ill, and when we checked her out she had a temperature of 102(!). Our vacation plan was to visit my wife's family, which includes a whole clan of adults and their young kids, so bringing our sick kid would basically be a total dick move. As of right now, we have put the vacation on hold until we see how this illness shakes out.\n\nRegardless, we have to tell Jenna that we don't need a pet sitter anymore. I feel bad canceling on her so I told my wife that we should still kick her $25 (the equivalent of one day's work) for the burden of our cancellation, as a way to let her know that we take her work seriously and value her time.\n\nMy wife thinks that we should give Jenna $75, half her proposed pay, because Jenna likely has already made plans for the cash and losing so much would be hard for a kid.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that it sucks to lose a job because of forces outside of your control, my take is that we are cancelling within a reasonable amount of time for a valid reason, and 1-day worth of pay is a reasonable compensation. I might be showing my ass here a little bit but oh well - when I was a young person, if I took a babysitting job or whatnot and it fell through, I could expect absolute jack shit from the cancelling party. Getting anything as a means of saying sorry for your time would have blown my mind.\n\nThat said! That was then and this is now. So I'm asking the good people of reddit to tell me, is $25 for not doing a $150 job fair? Or should buck the fuck up and pitch Jenna $75 for her trouble?\n\nI'm not really invested in this emotionally, my wife and I just disagreed and thought that the internet would be an objective third party. Also, if you guys are going to come at me for only paying $150 for the pet sitting (A price that fully recognize is very very good), all I really have to say is that that was her price, she knows what pet sitters cost, and she is just kinda a cool kid who likes our animals. We're friends with her mom, who is a veterinarian, and odd jobs like this are a way for her to earn spending cash.\n\nAll right, I think that's it.

But how about a compromise? Instead of pet sitting, could you change the arrangement to just taking your dog for a walk every day?

You sound financially able to and its the holidays (not coming at you for the pricing), as you said its her spending money.

You never know when an emergency might come up and she remembers what you did for her :)", "YTA for taking advantage of your neighbor in the first place.  $150 for a week of pet care is criminally low.  At 15 she likely does not fully understand the market and $150 may seem like a lot, but you know better.", "NTA. As a former pet sitter in high school, I\u2019d have loved to have gotten anything for compensation for a job I didn\u2019t have to do. Whether you give her $25 or $75 is up to you and your spouse, but the gift of either amount is a considerate thing do give her :)", "Hmm.  Gotta disagree with some of these answers.   I do petsitting and regardless of late cancelling I would never expect payment for doing no work.  ANY amount you give her would be just fine.   Oh, and if she pet sits for you again, a little gift at the end is cool to receive.  Like a tip but not a tip. Probably half my clients do this.

So in comparison 75 seems light.", "YTA.\n\nBut not a massive arsehole cos everything here seems quite reasonable, it's not on of those where it's like, 'am I the arsehole for leaving my wife and 6 kids for a ferret' type things.\n\nI'd give her 50% because you cancelled very very late and she was probably banking on that money and planned what she'll do with it, she's only 15 after all - who knows she may have rearranged some commitments too already to do it. But 24 hours notice... it doesn't sit right with me that you only give ger $25. Should be half I think.\n\nI hope Jenna sees this post though and decides in future to get non refundable deposits for pet and baby sitting! Never too early to start protecting your worth as a freelancer.", "Idk why people are saying $75 - that amount only exists because of your wife\u2019s suggestion. I\u2019ve never heard of a HALF cancellation fee. $25 is generous", "NTA. Am I the only one who thinks it\u2019s unusual to pay for canceled services you\u2019re not going to need? Seems crazy to me. \n\nIf you cancel a hair appointment, you don\u2019t pay. If you cancel a doctor\u2019s appointment, you don\u2019t pay. If you cancel a dinner reservation, you don\u2019t pay. You\u2019re canceling well in advance. And even if you canceled last minute, it\u2019s not unreasonable to not pay for services you don\u2019t end up needing.", "NTA. $25 seems reasonable given that you canceled with over a day's notice. $0 would have also been reasonable. I don't think 15 year olds typically plan out their budget in advance, so you probably don't need to worry that she's already made plans for the cash. \n\nYou could also just ask Jenna what she thinks is fair and pay her that amount. Think of it as an investment for securing her future services.", "NAH.\n\nWith the facts as stated, were it me, I\u2019d pay $75, especially if I\u2019m thinking to hire her again in the future. \n\nI would also, as a family friend, help her out by explaining what a cancellation policy is and proactively negotiate one next time.", "YTA.

Think of it as an investment in your future happiness.", "NTA $25 is a good cancellation fee. You are right $75 is a bit much for a cancellation fee under normal circumstances. If you want to give more thats being generous since it is Christmas. People complain all the time about not getting refunds for cancelling or getting hit with high cancellation fees yet are saying you should be giving her $75 because she's a kid and its Christmas. If nothing else give her the $75 and tell her its part for cancelling and part for a  Christmas bonus. This way there's no expectation to get paid half if this situation happens again not around the holidays.", "FFS blow the dust off of your wallet and pay the girl.

That seems generous pay for a neighbor's pet sitting services.

Just pay the girl, OP. It's the nice thing to do and presumably won't impact your finances at all. What is technically fair or not isn't really an issue in my opinion. This is more about being generous around the holidays and maintaining a good relationship with her.", "I'd give her the whole $150. \n\nHaving her willing to sit for you in the future will save you at least that much the very next time you need her since, and I know you think we should all ignore this, you're more or less ripping her off. Your next six day trip will recoup your $150.\n\nBut, if I'm her, and I know I'm already cutting you a massive break, I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to reorganize plans to make it happen in the future, since the money wasn't reliable.\n\n\nThere is a teenager in my neighborhood who does yard mowing who I hire every summer. He is a better deal than a typical company, but not nearly as ridiculous as the one you are getting for pet sitting. We had some work done on our house last fall and wouldn't need him for the last month of summer. I just paid him anyway so that I could stay on his list for next year. Maintaining good relationships with people who do service for you, especially when they do it exceptionally well or cut you a great rate should always be a priority when possible. Being a stickler about $50 with someone you trust with your animals, who is willing to work for more than half off, is just dumb.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't call anyone TA.

Good luck.", "YTA  \nTo be honest, I would still pay the 150, because that is a lot to a 15yo and she will be counting on the money, especially just before Christmas.
