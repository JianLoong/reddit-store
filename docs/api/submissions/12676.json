My fiance and I are in a fortunate position that the wedding is being paid for by her parents, my parents and ourselves.\n\nIt's important to us that we only have people there that we are close with + their partners and cap it at 90 during the day time (ourselves included) but we sat our parents down as we were assembling the guest list to ask them if there was anyone that they would like to be at the ceremony. My dad asked for his brother and his brother's two sons, his niece, and his best friend and his wife. My mum asked for one of her sisters and her husband, and her dad and wife. I dislike my granddad for a variety of personal reasons but I agreed as I knew it meant a lot to her. My fiance's parents asked for similar things. We then built our guestlist around the remaining space we had left after our parents requested guests.\n\nWe informed caterers, venue, etc of our guest numbers. Since then we've had a few people ask to attend the ceremony that we didn't really consider but have added them to the night time party as there is still room for guests on that list.\n\nHowever, about a week ago, my dad pulled me aside and insisted that we must invite my mum's aunt and uncle to the ceremony. I haven't seen these people in over a decade in any meaningful way and said unfortunately that there wasn't space during the day but they can come to the night time party. My dad stressed it would mean a lot to my mum so I said that if someone pulls out of the ceremony, they can have their spots. Fast forward to today, and they brought it up again. I explained that they were asked ages ago who they wanted there so we could build our guest list around that and they never once brought up my mum's aunt and uncle. I stood my ground and apologised but was adamant that the best we were willing to do was invite them to the evening and bump them up a day invitation if some people pulled out. My dad threatened us and said \"you had better hope someone pulls out of the wedding\"... I laughed in disbelief and an argument broke out. I said we had met my mum in the middle by giving them an opportunity early on to invite whoever they wanted, even inviting a family member I dislike (my grandad) as I knew it meant a lot to my mum. I asked him \"when did this stop being our choice?\" and he said \"I'm not arguing with you about this.\" I said \"that's exactly what you're doing.\" and he said \"I'm the d\\*\\*\\*head who's paying for this wedding\". That was enough for me. I knew at some point that he would hold his portion of the money over our heads if he wasn't getting his way. I told him as much, grabbed my coat and left as he told me to \"f\\*\\*\\* off\". \n\nMy mum obviously said I was out of order and selfish. My sister and fiance believe we are in the right as it's our wedding but I would like the all knowing internet to decide.

The original guest list they insisted on was ridiculous and I would have said no then. If that's the trade for them paying imo it's not worth it. It's not their wedding. If they want to throw a party, they can throw a party. If these people care so much to see the wedding then they can hire a videographer I guess. They are just using your wedding as an excuse to have a family reunion it seems. And not like you didn't say they were welcome at the night party. All of those things aside you also can't just change the number of guests when things have been planned.", "NTA, if you and your fianc\u00e9 can pay for all of it yourselves, do so.

Unfortunately many people act like this.\n\n>we sat our parents down as we were assembling the guest list to ask them if there was anyone that they would like to be at the ceremony.\n\nThat should have been the end of it but sometimes they just can't resist the temptation to make things unpleasant. Give them their money back and tell them to have a party with the people who matter to them instead of going to your wedding.", "INFO:  what is the reason the guest list can\u2019t expand by two, if someone else is paying?

The window for adding even *more* people has closed. \n\nYour dad holding over your  head who is paying for the wedding\u2026 well F that. \n\nMaybe your parents can pay through the nose to add the your moms aunt and uncle or suck it up that *there will be no wedding*.

You gave them the opportunity to say who they wanted. \n\nI had a similar problem with my parents. Where I got to was they gave us money towards our wedding as a gift, not to have say over everything. I\u2019d already invited my AH aunt and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable inviting friends of theirs I didn\u2019t know over people I knew very well. We said if we\u2019d misunderstood why they\u2019d given us money towards our wedding, we\u2019d hand the money back. They backed down after that.", "Let's just be honest here. If you want to decide a full 100% who is coming to the wedding, you should pay yourself.", "This right here is why I think everybody should pay for their own damn wedding. ESH.", "Since your father is being a complete AH, how about you cancel the wedding he is paying for and just get married by a justice of the peace (or whatever the UK equivalent of that is?) You can have the big ceremony at a later date on your own dime and with whatever guests you want to invite. If it is that important to you, give your dad the ultimatum: \u201cIf the guest list changes, there won\u2019t be any wedding, at least not one that you are invited to.\u201d\n\nBut is this really the hill you want to die on? You told your dad that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t space during the day,\u201d which actually isn\u2019t true since you have acknowledged that the venue \u201ccaps at 100.\u201d Obviously, your parents made a mistake by forgetting a couple of people they wanted to invite when they gave you their initial list. It sounds like it won\u2019t cost you anything to add two more names to the list. Your unwillingness to give your parents a little slack (at least for the sake of your mom) is puzzling to me. Are you on solid moral ground to be totally inflexible at this point? Yes. Is this a fight I would want to pick while I\u2019m getting ready to be wed? Nope.", "NTA. You gave them the chance to invite who they wanted. They should not be trying to add people late. \n\nHowever, in the grand scheme of things, inviting two extra people to the wedding should be more of an, eye roll and acquiesced, not a hill to die on. Wedding are expensive for one, and no wedding ever goes off without some unexpected problem or issue. So if inviting two extra guests is the worst issue you encounter for your big day, count yourself lucky. \n\nUnless you have the funds to cover your dad's part. In which case just say \"no worries you don't have to pay for it at all\" and then distinctive all their chosen guests. \n\nBut if you're relying on their money, just let them have the small victories so you can have a peaceful and easy day.\n\nCongrats on the marriage btw!!!!", "YTA. If there still some space available, and he pays for them, what do you care?", "Nah, totally not TA, your wedding, your list.\n\nYour family have given you a gift of financial support for the wedding, in no other scenario does a gift come with strings attached and I don't believe it should be the same with a wedding.\n\nThe issue is that there's a long-standing history of parents pushing their guest lists onto their children and most of the time it's cool but sometimes they over reach. Your dad sounds like he's not used to being told know, but you rationalized it and came up with a compromise. Not much more you can do at this point.", "Yta- if you want to stomp your feet and make drama well then pay for your own wedding. They are family not some randoms you don\u2019t know. You\u2019re the one power tripping. Apple does fall far from the tree. Have some grace a reach out the olive branch.", "Yta it\u2019s two extra people your parents are paying for a significant portion of the wedding, enough to cover those two people for sure.  You\u2019re being selfish and stubborn, it doesn\u2019t matter about your grandad or giving them a chance to invite people earlier.  \n\n2 extra people on top of 90 literally doesn\u2019t matter when it\u2019s an ask from people contributing money to the wedding.  Lmao at the \u201cI knew at some point they\u2019d hold the money over my head\u201d line too when this is again, over two people. Relatives at that.  You should see some of the shit people post about that are real examples of having the money held over their head.  Like actual demands about the way the wedding goes, attire, food venue etc.  \n\n Yta you even said in a comment that the venue caps at 100 people so this literally is just stubbornness.  Your parents would be right to pull out their money", "ESH. I think you've been very naive about your wedding planning and made some incorrect assumptions, namely that the guest list is your choice. Traditionally, if parents are contributing towards the wedding, each set of parents chooses 1/3 of the guests and the couple get to choose the other 1/3. Your parents think they have a right to choose some of the guests, but you don't seem to believe this is the case and that they should be contributing out of 'love'. It doesn't work that way. You did give them the opportunity to name who they wanted, but this wasn't a great act of generosity - it's what they're entitled to. When did it stop being your choice? When your parents contributed. You are indeed being selfish, maybe not intentionally, but there it is. If you want 100% control over your wedding, you need to pay for 100% of it yourself. Your dad, however, did not handle this well. They should have told you much earlier that they wanted to invite these people and he shouldn't be threatening you. I hope you can sort this out but you may need to have a wedding that you and your fiance can afford.", "NTA. You gave them the opportunity to invite who they want. They can\u2019t keep adding people.", "ESH. Lack of communication from everyone. OP expected that dad contributed to pay no strings attached. Dad expected to help pay with strings attached.\n\nIf Dad\u2019s helping pay, then he has the right to pull out. OP also has the right to call him an AH. Not unless it\u2019s discussed in the beginning that all financial help for the wedding comes with no strings attached, then it\u2019d be a different story.

Not once were the aunt and uncle mentioned.\n\nI am also now preparing paying for my dad's gift towards our wedding.", "That is my view on this too. While a part of me does think \"hey wouldn't it be so much easier to just give them what they want and rearrange a few things with the seating, caterers, etc\" I do think that giving them an inch may turn into giving them a mile down the line (my mum has already stressed her disapproval of certain aspects of our wedding so...) \n\nMy dad can be a very *very* unpleasant person when things don't go his way. But ultimately he is my dad and I do want him to have a great day at the wedding too.", "Exactly! I haven't seen these people at any of my mum's important dates AND they forgot them when we asked. \n\nOur thinking is that this is their kid and they would like to share the day with as many people as possible. I get that but it's our wedding. Not theirs.", "Because to some people a wedding is more than just a big party, it is a way to welcome a new person into a family (and their larger community) and to join two families together.", "I think after reading all these comments. I think the thing that crops up the most is that yeah it's just two people... It's what they symbolise that I have an issue with which is that even though the money was only accepted as it was stressed to be a gift with no strings attached, they can add strings as and when it suits them... which could lead to other issues down the line you know?\n\nAnd giving back the money will cause a lot of arguments with my dad who will see it as disrespectful.", "First off, thanks so much for the congrats and well wishes! It's going to be a blast!\n\nSecondly, that's my thinking. They're stressing the point that these people mean so much to my mum but 1. I haven't seen them at my mum's birthdays, anniversaries... no big events for over 20 years now really. And 2. as you said, they forgot them when we asked if there was anyone they would like at the ceremony. They surely can't be that important haha!", "Thanks for the advice, I'll be sure to have my mom's aunt and uncle do the ChaCha slide at the after-ceremony event.", "Part of me did want to argue with my grandfather and certain other guests being at the ceremony but ultimately, at the time, it was easier to say yes and I do truly want my parents to have the people that mean a lot to them there on the day which is why we extended that opportunity to have them let us know who that would be. The two people that they are arguing about were not brought up once and we have had our guestlist finalised for a long time now.", "That seems to be the direction we are heading but I know that us rejecting the gift will come with a MUCH bigger set of arguments...", "That is our stance. That should have been the end of it but we hoped that any additions could be invited to the evening and that would be good enough... apparently not.", "The venue caps at 100 during the day but it's more that we didn't want \"random\" people at our wedding. We asked our parents who would mean a lot to them to be invited and then built the remaining guestlist around that. We have sorted everything with caterers etc but that main reason is, these are two people that we have no connection with AND on top of that, my fiances parents have since asked for extra guests to be invited which we said yes to but only the night time and her parents have bee completely respectful of that.", "The argument some people are making is that it even though it's not our fault, it would just be simpler to give him what they want but I think that kind of misses a huge chunk of what I said in the post about how we wanted our day to be and the compromises we've made.", "This is where I don't want to push back on them. I know those people being there will make my dad happy and I do truly want that which is why, before we started any of the guestlist, we made sure our parents had first pick of the slots for the ceremony, whether we were close with them or not. It's just now after everything has been arranged that they are trying to add two people i haven't interacted with in literal decades. I don't want my dad to have to cancel invitations to people he's already invited because I want him to have a great day, but I also think he shouldn't be doing what he's doing at the moment.", "Funny you should mention that! I did actually want to elope. Get on a cruise and marry just us two then have a small party with close family and friends when we were home. But my fiance wanted a more \"wedding-ish\" wedding and I was more than happy to go along with what she wanted!\n\nI just wish they wouldn't have stressed that the money was a gift with no strings attached. Had I known they didn't mean it, I'd have turned the gift down. What hurts the most is the weird threat though \"You'd both better hope someone pulls out of the ceremony\"... or what? Seems awful for a parent to say that to their kid about their wedding.\n\nThank you for taking the time to respond though! Really appreciate it!", "If I could pick any option, consequence free, it would be this one haha", "Thank you for the kind words!", "How long did they push the issue for if you don't mind me asking?", "This is something I am now considering. However, the money from our parents for our wedding should just come from love. Not for leverage/power.", "Even when it's a gift? My fiance's parents have been helpful and respectful of our choices and wishes every step of the way. Why can't my parents do the same especially when I feel we've made a fair compromise to their last minute add on of two people I haven't seen in 20+ years?", "We are debating asking him to withdraw his gift which I can cover. The issue with that is it will cause much more of an issue as they will see that as us cutting them out of the wedding which is not what we want. We want them to be apart of OUR wedding. I think we've made some fair compromises. The space at the actual venue isn't the issue. It's that we only wanted people at the wedding who we were close with (besides the people we allowed our parents to invite obviously). \n\nI think it's totally unfair to say we haven't given them a little slack when our only goal was to have a wedding consisting of people that we were close to but still invited people our parents wanted there when asked - before we added anyone else to the guest list. That was our first priority: make sure they had who they wanted on the list before we invited our guests. But to then add on two extra guests is a bit of a pisstake. The sole reason for that is that these are two people I haven't seen in 20 years?\n\nIs this a fight I want? Obviously not. Is it a fight I think is worth having considering what we were told initially (the money was a gift and that the wedding was to be the way we wanted it - my dads words, not mine)? I think so, but that's why I posted here.", "I totally get your \"grand scheme of things\" perspective. It's why I made this post really! But from day one my fiance and I have said we only want people we are close to at the ceremony so while it would be easier to say \"fine. we'll rearrange some things and accommodate them\" it would sort of be going back on what we wanted from our day to begin with which I'm sure you understand. We aren't relying on the money as such, it was just a very generous gift from both her parents and mine but we were told, repeatedly, that it was a gift and that the most important thing was that we get the wedding we want. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much on the congrats! Despite this hiccup, it's shaping up to be a great day!", "As stated, we only want people we are close to at the ceremony. We have allowed some wiggle room when we asked our parents if there were people they wanted there (most of whom are people we aren't close to). We added them to the list and organised everything and now my parents are wanting to add two people I haven't seen or spoken to in 20 years or so? Even then I have said they are welcome to attend the evening party AND if someone who is invited to the ceremony pulls out, they are top of the list to have their spots. Hope that's answered why I care.", "You're definitely right about him not being used to being told no. I had feared that something like this would happen but I wasn't expecting it to go as far as veiled threats you know? The whole thing got me thinking maybe we were being \"bridezilla\" and whatever the groom version of that is by putting our foot down but I think we've been fair since the start.", "Just because you\u2019re related to someone by blood doesnt give them the right to be at your wedding", "But they essentially are some randoms I don't know? I haven't seen those people in 20 years or so and I stressed that we didn't want the ceremony clustered with people we weren't close with...", "Appreciate your take on this but find it a bit strange that you think I'm being selfish and stubborn for saying no after we made sure the people our parents wanted there were on the guestlist before anyone else AND assured them that the two people they are trying to get added on to the ceremony are now top of the list to be invited to the ceremony should anyone be unable to attend, yet you don't think its selfish and stubborn the way my parents are behaving trying to invite two people I haven't seen in 20 years and haven't attended any of my mums important dates? I think you're way off on this one. I have said, the venue cap isn't the issue - we only want people we are close to at the wedding. Some people in here have said \"hey, your parents seem to be the assholes here but maybe just let them have this one for the sake of things\" which is fair enough, I get that stance from the outside but your comment isn't realistic at all.", "I appreciate your comment but think you're totally off on the \"if parents are contributing towards the wedding, each set of parents chooses 1/3 of the guests\". Of every wedding I have attended or been a part of, this has not been the case. Also seems that a fair few people here agree that the money comes with no strings attached usually as it is a gift. Something that was stressed to us before we accepted the money. That it was a gift and that it was our wedding to plan.\n\nI do believe our parents should have guests there that mean a lot to them, thus we asked them who they wanted there despite our guestlist goal being just people we were close to. This was to make them happy as we do want them to has a great day too. However, considering that the two people they are now trying to add on are people I haven't seen or spoken to in 20 years, and they have not been at any of my mum's important dates in all that time and were not mentioned once when we asked them who they would like at the ceremony, I question how important these people actually are to my mum you know? I think adding them to the night list and bumping them up ahead of anyone else should people pull out is more than fair no? Out of genuine interest, how would you proceed?", "Thanks for your perspective on this! Really appreciate it!", "Sorry, I perhaps should have stated (had to shave it down to be within the 3000 character limit) that when we accepted this gift, he explained that it was just that - a gift, and that the most important thing was that we have the wedding we want.", "Sorry I did have this next point in the original version of this post but had to shave it down to be within the character limit:\n\nWe only took the money as it was stressed to us that it was a gift. Nothing more. And that the sole focus for our day was that we have the wedding we want. We are aware we are super fortunate, but I don't think adding strings on later when it suits you, contradicting what you said when the money was accepted, is fair.\n\nI'm prepared to give the gift back but trust me, knowing my dad, that will come with it's own set of arguments", "Reasonable enough, I do not see anything you could have done differently. Sorry you are in that situation, that sucks.", "OP, if you have to pay for the part of the wedding your dad was going to contribute- keep in mind that you may now disinvite anybody he had on his list. \n\nIt\u2019s too late, probably, but dropping people off the guest list *might* even save you some money! :)", "You are completely in the right here but I have to ask you, given all this, why on earth did you take money from them?", "Of course! Yes, also it's not that simple just to add two people, so I get that and I would also maybe? If it even makes sense explain it to your parents. Otherwise just go through with it and have a great day. Just focus on you and your partner. ;)", "Your dad is definitely being an AH here, to insist and get verbally nasty about it.  However, I don\u2019t really get this \u2018no random family members\u2019 rule - maybe it\u2019s a cultural difference?  If I were marrying and having a formal reception, I would expect to need to invite the whole extended family and any near relations who wanted to be there, or it would be seen as very rude.  Have other weddings in your family been inclusive of aunts/uncles/cousins/etc?  \n\nYes it\u2019s your wedding and technically you can invite or not invite whoever you want - but once the day is over, you have to deal with the fallout if you\u2019ve offended people.

People should pay for their own weddings for reasons just like this.", "I'm glad you're not letting this ruin your day. I completely agree if this is paramount to making your day special then it's up to you if it's a hill worth dying on.

Either choice is valid, which is why you're NTA \ud83d\ude01", "Someone will pull out for sure. So they will get the spots. So someone you don't care about will be there anyway.

Yes, they\u2019re the bride and groom\u2019s big day, but we\u2019ve lost the idea that they\u2019re also about families coming together to celebrate together.

I hope your parents pull their money out if you do.", "You didn't mention in your original post that your parents originally stressed that the money was a gift. The 1/3 rule is traditional, but so is the bride being a virgin. It may not be what people do now, but it is a tradition whether you've heard of it or not. I mentioned it to explain why you and your dad may have different expectations of what his contribution entitles him to. I do think your plan of adding them to the night list and then inviting them if anyone pulls out is the best compromise. But your dad may still decide he wants his gift back.", "he obviously changed his mind on it being just a gift or he told you it was just a gift either way I'm on yourside", "Happens I suppose! People say \"this gift has no strings attached\" but what they actually mean is \"this gift has no strings attached... until I want something\"", "I disagree, uninviting those people would be very rude, as they did not wrong op in any way.

We just want people we are close to and spend the ceremony part of the day with them, then in the night have more extended family and friends join us.\n\nThe is it worth it question is tough because they stated this gift had no strings attached and that the wedding was to be however we wanted it. Prior to this my mum has expressed her disapproval of certain things about the wedding... if they're willing to go back on the \"no strings\" attached aspect of the gift and we back down... will they then look to change some parts of the wedding they don't like? It's just a fear we both have now.\n\nAnd if we give the gift back, it'll cause more arguments as my dad will see it as us disrespecting him...\n\nBit of a rock and a hard place situation.", "I did don\u2019t worry! Haha", "I guess I hoped? He has always, in my eyes done this. I have expressed this fear to siblings/my mum who assured me that he wouldn't do that so I believed that he wouldn't do it this time... I guess  we were wrong", "It certainly did but we were given reassurances that the money was to allow us to focus on having the wedding we wanted. No strings. But some people do say one thing and then go back on it when convenient for them which I do understand but it just sucks when that person is your dad you know?\n\nI am totally prepared to give the gift back. The thought crossed my mind the moment I left but, believe me knowing my dad, giving the gift back will come with it's own set of arguments. MUCH bigger than this one I would expect.\n\nAlso, thank you for responding to this post! The whole thing has been really helpful", "I think I want to just say they can come BUT ask them to please never do this (hold the money over our heads, especially as it was intended as a gift with no strings and then idly threaten us) again. \n\nThank you so much for taking the time to reply though! It's genuinely been really helpful! Even the people who think I'm TA", "You've kind of made my point for me? We've made a decent compromise by bumping them to the top of the list so that if anyone does pull out then hey! they get the spots before anyone else. The compromise from their side has to be to allow that to happen. Our chosen guests may all RSVP as attending, we're asking for our chosen guests to be given the chance first.

Would have made an effort with her son (me) in the last 20 years? I dunno... doesn't sound very close to me.\n\nI have no ill will against those people at all! They're just distant relatives which were a group of people we didn't really want at the wedding. In my opinion, they have been invited as my mum is *very* close with my grandad (which is why I did not fight her when she asked he be invited despite my dislike of the man) and the aunt in question is my grandad's sister and they are close... I believe my grandad may have asked my mum if his sister could come and that is what has started this all. I'm sure you can see where I'm coming from? The money was a gift.

Totally willing to do that. \n\nYour points however may be a bit moot as (and I apologise as I didn't have space to state this in the post) the money was given to us as a gift.

They're my mums. I haven't seen or spoken to them in 20+ years? I haven't been invited to a single thing of theirs and why would I be? We're estranged relatives?

We're being stubborn on a point we made clear from day one? \n\nOur concern is if we give them an inch, they'll take a mile as my mum has expressed some other changes she would have liked to make...\n\nBut if we don't and we return the gift, it will cause a string of other arguments (my dad will see it as disrespectful and will see it as us cutting him out of the wedding).", "I'm not sure you've read the full post. The venue cap isn't the issue. We want the ceremony to only be people we are close to (besides the guests we allowed our parents to invite). The two extra people are not close to us. At all.

They haven't even been at any important dates that involve my mum. \n\nBefore we even accepted their contribution, we were told it was a gift and that the only thing we were to focus on was to have the wedding the way we wanted it.\n\nSorry but I think you're way off on this one still.", "I know, that's my bad but I had to keep it within the 3000 limit.\n\nI think you've kind of made my next point for me there, it's a tradition like the bride being a virgin... I think those traditions died out some time ago. At least in my experience. So it isn't something at any point was discussed, the opposite was stressed actually as I said this was told to be a gift and that the focus was to make sure the wedding was the way we wanted it.\n\nI think you're right about the compromise but apparently that isn't good enough. I feel a little stuck between a rock and a hard place. We either give him what he wants and have the money held over our head again any time him or my mum wish to make alterations (I mentioned in another comment that my mum has expressed distaste on a few things for the wedding) OR we give him the gift back which, believe me, will come with a bunch more arguments (he'll see it as disrespectful and us cutting him out of the wedding).", "Appreciate it", "This is not a wedding specific question but why do you care if he thinks it\u2019s disrespectful?

Skip the inevitable argument over \u201ctelling us what to do with our money\u201d and simply decline all further financial gifts from them.\n\nAs for the extra guests, you mentioned in another comment that your in-laws have asked for guests to be added to the day event, but accepted the compromise of adding them to the night event instead.  For that reason, I\u2019d hold firm on doing the same with the random aunt and uncle, if it were me.
