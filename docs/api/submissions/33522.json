U r even free to dump it in the trash cos it's your property now. \n\nBut if u put yourself in the gifter's shoes, you would like the other party to treasure the stuffs u gift them. How would u feel if your husband threw the stuffs u gave him around. \n\nYour husband knows you that you doesn't show him respect, yet he chose to gift u expensive stuffs and get mad with it.", "kinda ahish cuz why wouldn\u2019t you want your nice things protected but if i bought you an i phone id buy you a protector", "I'm clumsy too. Not just gonna say to get protective cases and screen protectors for your stuff because its been pretty well-covered by everyone.\n\nDo want to say that its a pretty large waste of money to not get a $20 case and $20 screen protector. Amazon even has packs of cases and screen protectors that you can buy to keep your devices from breaking. And you can get cases that are reflective of your personal style.", "After a good few cracked screens in my early 20s i decided to start getting screen protectors/cases for my phones because im a clumsy shit \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 u fortunately at work with glass vials/bottles theres no protection for them \ud83d\ude48", "ESH stop buying apple products, they break if you sneeze on them", "I'm not sure I'd call you an AH but I would say you're careless when it comes to your personal belongings.  You're an adult and need to learn how to take better care of your things.  I don't blame your husband for being upset with you.  Electronics are expensive and anybody would expect an adult to take better care of them.  You need to figure out what you can do to better care for your things like getting protective covers for them, etc.  Don't leave them laying around when you're finished using them.  Put them in a safe place when not in use.", "YTA for not getting protection for all the electronics.\n\nBut have you been tested for any neurological disorder that may cause the clumsiness?  I remember one Ask A Manager where the poster was always getting bruised and breaking  toes, getting black eyes from her clumsiness and it turned out to be a perception disorder that was treatable.\n\nOr maybe an executive function disorder, which is why you didn't get protection in the first place?", "Otterbox for the win! I got bumped into while getting off a commuter train and my Ipad hit the metal ramp. Not a \\*scratch\\*", "It\u2019s a values thing. Some people have different values and there is a mismatch here.  I don\u2019t think anyone is an asshole but I do hold a balue that is against waste and that respects the hard work put into getting a nice life", "How is she an ah, it was a gift, at that point its hers to do with as she pleases. Why isnt he the ah, he knows shes clumsy but buys her these things without any protection, almost as if hes trying to find a reason to put her down", "Yeah that\u2019s fair and definitely part of my problem. Not only am I aware that I\u2019m clumsy, but haven\u2019t done much to prevent damage. There are may areas in my life where I just can\u2019t get my shit together and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. I have a job, I study and am productive, but still make careless mistakes in those parts of my life often too. Maybe I need to find a way to figure out what that\u2019s all about", "Right?! I was reading along nodding as I too can be clumsy until I got to the \u201cI don\u2019t buy protective gear\u201d WHAT? OP knowing she\u2019s clumsy chooses not to. It\u2019s an YTA move. All my electronics have protection cause I drop that shit by accident all the time.", "I literally go for cases that are known for good durability over how aesthetically pleasing they are bc I'm too clumsy.", "I\u2019m even terrified to take my phone out of the case to clean, so I make sure I do it over a towel on the floor so I won\u2019t accidentally break it", "The protective gear thing was mentioned only as a tool to push away responsibility", "I don't have any issues with anything you said, except that if he's that concerned about it, protective gear could've been purchased as a gift as well. They're married, he should know about her habits. He's as much to blame for this as OP.", "I was thinking this, too.  \nI was diagnosed young, and I've spilt countless drinks, broken a fuckton of things, and it's all unintentional (and most of the time unavoidable).  \n\n\nI wouldn't say there's 'bad things going on neurologically', just that dyspraxics aren't neurotypical and our brains are wired different, so it can be a bit of a challenge for us to get to grips with normal tasks (such as doing up buttons on out clothes, tying shoelaces, using cutlery, processing issues, memory issues, ect), but the symptoms are different for everyone in different levels of effecting the person.", "Yeah this. Otter boxes and screen protectors exist, make it part of the gift or don't use it till you get one. He also has the choice of not buying you expensive gifts if it's going to trigger him? You guys might like to sit down and just talk this through and work out strategies going forward to prevent this situation happening again.", "The phone is also a few years old. It's not like she's breaking them instantly", "Or buy cheaper items, second hand older phones, or maybe android\u2026.", "Lol electronics are absolutely not investments, they depreciate the instant you open the box. They are tools.", "I second pop sockets. I don't know how I managed to hold my phone without them before", "I have OCD, but this for sure isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been asked that. My brother has adhd though", "It\u2019s a matter of respect. It\u2019s showing your loved one that you don\u2019t appreciate or care about the gifts", "Yeah I totally agree", "So my brother breaks just about everything that has ever been given to him, but has always been careful with the things he buys.  \nIf this is the case with you, then it leans towards not respecting gifts.  \nIf you are this way with everything gift or not, well, not sure what to say.  \nBut, as you know this about yourself, I'm going to have to go with YTA.", "I hate to armchair diagnose, but I have ADHD, and all of the issues you\u2019ve mentioned (clumsiness, inattentiveness, executive dysfunction etc) sound like traits to me. Maybe something to look into.", "ever been tested for ADHD?", "Just buy protective cases for what you own. What do you need to figure out?", "ADHD check would be worth looking into. It affects all those areas you mention, and it goes undetected quite a lot in childhood, more commonly for women or people who can mask it well. I am similar to what you described, trying really hard to hold it together but stuff just kept slipping through the cracks no matter what I did, lots of silly/careless mistakes.", "No, you ARE the problem. You don't care enough about the things you have been gifted to put the effort into protecting them. Cases and screen protectors exist for good reason. If you cared about your possessions then you'd make the effort to get things to keep them safe.", "Have you been screened for ADHD? (I say this as an ADHD person who has to buy heavy-duty everything to protect my nice stuff.)", "The amount of time you spent writing that paragraph about how you\u2019re trying to gain sympathy here you could have ordered a case and a screen protector.", "Yep. I can't tell you the amount of times I've dropped my phone, but you can bet it's still running bc I make sure it's got a good case and protector. I learned my lesson once w hile ago and haven't needed to pearn it again.", "Durability and ease to find it. My pink camo Otterbox back in the day, my shop foreman teased me until he drove over his phone one day", "Might as well blame him for marrying such a clumsy person in the first place at this point?", "OP, you probably have ADHD, it typically presents itself differently in women and it might do you some good to go get tested.\n\nSo I'm gonna go NTA on this but you would be YTA if you don't look deeper into these issues.\n\n[ADHD](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/add-adhd/adhd-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-women.htm)", "That was my guess too", "I was always making mistakes  at work, I felt awful, but no matter how careful I was( meaning I'd work an hour on something that should take a couple minutes.", "I dropped my phone once and it hit the sweet spot on the screen cracking it right where you\u2019d slide it. I couldn\u2019t open it. I had just gotten home from vacation and hadn\u2019t uploaded my pics \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude2b Only thing that saved me was my tech friend who was able to hack my phone to retrieve them. Hard lesson learned and never ever again!"]}
