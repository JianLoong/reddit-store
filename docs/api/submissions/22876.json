People are responsible for their own behavior, not other people's.

A friend I met at a support group for survivors of SA where both our work histories were occasionally relevant to how we regarded our trauma and so did others pointed out the other women used to ask the most invasive questions of me but never asked her the same as a female undertaker. None of the grossest dead body she\u2019d seen or if she had attended a murder scene stuff. \n\nShe also pointed out that statistically in our country and at a fucking support group for SA a female undertaker is pretty rare and sex workers sadly aren\u2019t so how come they all instinctively knew not to pry at the truly unusual job? She was also currently in said job and I had been \u2018retired\u2019 for a decade.\n\nThe absolute squirming silence from all the service users and the therapist was endless. It only broke when she said \u2018ok, good to know. You are actually fucking ghouls then. Always useful to check in my profession.\u2019 Neither of us went back to the group after that night.\n\nSadly I find women far more personally judgy about sex work than men. Men tend if they react to take more general madonna/whore vibe but not once has one asked me what my weirdest client was. Some have said \u2018like full service or phone sex?\u2019 Or \u2018oh so BDSM sex work, wow\u2019. Women will often start trying to debate sex work, BDSM etc while using me as an prop to whichever side they take.\n\nI usually now remind them often clients hired me to talk like this and it didn\u2019t even end in sex and I still billed my hourly rate since I didn\u2019t offer any more info than \u2018I was a sex worker.\u2019 Screening is included in the fee and if I don\u2019t offer further info unsolicited, we aren\u2019t close enough and it\u2019s work so I can give my fee?\n\nI also used to be a make up artist and if you are respectful of my skilled work there I might share some stories of what kinds of work I did and where. If people immediately want full on make up lessons and skilled work, I also remind them that has a fee. I\u2019m not on the clock as an MLM promoting sex toys or mascara, I\u2019m socialising.\n\nI get called stuck up way more than the undertaker. No one wants to ask her why funerals are so expensive and how to save on coffins. They do worry about her mental health in such a stressful job though. It\u2019s always fascinating comparing to me especially I try not to disclose either former career too much while she is currently working in the funeral industry.", "AITA becoming exhausting with all the bots... Maybe it's for the best if it helps me quit tahe ita addiction.", "I agree with your friends that this was a teachable moment. To me, it sounds like they were just curious\u2026you might be the first sex worker any of them have ever meant.", "I mean sex workers usually do come from trauma, specifically sa, it's rare that they don't. It's not a personal slight to point that out. I agree you shouldn't shame somebody for being a sex worker and that being a female undertaker might have had something to do with trauma too.", "Just because OP brought the subject up does not mean she has to entertain creepy ass questions.", ">You took everything as a personal attack.\n\n\nMaybe she took it that way because she wasn't there in the role of a teacher or as an ambassador of her former work. \n\n\n>You could\u2019ve just said from the beginning you don\u2019t want to talk about it\n\n\nOr their parents could have taught them proper table manners. Game time is not for dissecting someone's sex life.", "Are you saying her statement about the Guinness book of records wasn't clear I'm saying she doesn't want to talk about her past work? I'm also not sure which point you mean about the subject changing...", "Sarcasm is not the same as saying \"I don't want to answer that\" or \"I am uncomfortable with this question\" or \"I find that rude and too personal, let's move on.\"\n\nPlenty of people are sarcastic without it meaning discomfort; I myself am one of them. If I said that, I would expect people to laugh, not to take it as a signal that I'm uncomfy. I'm a big girl, I can tell people plainly if I don't like what they're saying. Similarly, plenty of people do not understand sarcasm, therefore it is not an effective tool to communicate serious concerns. It absolutely was not clear. \n\nAfter OP starts getting noticeably angry, one of the roommates immediately starts talking about a fantasy. This is a normal thing for girls to talk about together, and sure, possibly inspired by talk about sex work. But it was an end to the questioning, which is what OP's problem was with. That's a subject change, a step away from the questions, and possibly one done because the person saw her get agitated - we don't know.", "\"I see that you are uncomfortable about talking about your sex life so let me tell all about my sexual fanatsies\"... thats a great subject change.", "Ehhh..I feel like it sarcasm entirely depends on A) the subject and B) the person - here sex work is still something we know isn't as comfortable to talk about as favorite ice cream flavor and this is a complete stranger, so assuming \"sarcasm = you want to keep talking about it\" seems a bit premature.\n\nAs for sexual fantasies - I'm not female but other females have commented it's *not* something they talk about, so your experience may not be uniform. Also, bringing it right after asking a person about their sex work isn't changing the subject - more like talking about something that is related, hence OP being irritated. If I share that a friend miscarried, I'd be a bit irritated at someone immediately bringing up how they can't wait to close on their new house that has room for a nursery."]}
