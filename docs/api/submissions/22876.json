People are responsible for their own behavior, not other people's.

She was also currently in said job and I had been \u2018retired\u2019 for a decade.\n\nThe absolute squirming silence from all the service users and the therapist was endless. It only broke when she said \u2018ok, good to know. You are actually fucking ghouls then. Always useful to check in my profession.\u2019 Neither of us went back to the group after that night.\n\nSadly I find women far more personally judgy about sex work than men.

You had the opportunity to say you were uncomfortable talking about it and wanted to change the subject but instead you got more and more agitated, continued not to use your words and let your anger build up until you exploded and kind of caused a scene. \n\nSure these women couldn't take the hint but frankly they didn't know you well enough to be able to read your hints anyway.\n\nI think you sound kind of immature and emotionally volatile, and these girls sound immature and sheltered. I think the person who suffers the most in this scenario is the friend you came to see. In all likelihood she probably will not remain close friends with you after this as you've exposed yourself for being kind of a loose cannon. \n\nNext time you don't want to talk about subject matter that is very fascinating to a lot of people and pretty edgy and controversial, Don't bring it up or after you bring it up and people start asking about it use your words and make it clear you are uncomfortable continuing the conversation and no longer want to talk about it.", "NTA. I can see how it would be tempting to have a discussion with a sex worker. That's not a common occurrence for most people, and they probably found your life fascinating. However, good manners dictate that they should have stopped asking questions once you expressed your discomfort.", "NTA\n\nThe people calling you an asshole are probably the same people who see a gay colleague's photo of his husband on his desk and ask 'are you the man or woman in the relationship?' or 'isn't anal sex painful?' Then they claim that he made himself available to being asked intrusive questions merely by existing out of the closet.", "Yes! So glad this is a highly upvoted comment! \n\nIt is _not_ the job of a minority to educate the majority. That idea, of \u201cyou could teach us about yourself\u201d, is the embodiment of lazy, ignorant, unreflective privilege. Ugh it makes me so mad", "People just behave this way about anything to do with sexuality, I find. It\u2019s bizarre. It\u2019s like\u2026 sort of a generally private thing, but when someone \u201ccomes out\u201d as something that they associate with sex publically, for some reason they think it\u2019s fair game.\n\nSame with coming out as gay or trans. The amount of people who think this gives them full license to ask intimate questions about someone\u2019s sex life or genitals is insane. My mom struggled with this when my sister came out because everyone would ask her \u201chas she had the surgery?\u201d \u201cWhen is she going to?\u201d And I had to just tell her it was not an appropriate question for her to answer, and that it was okay to tell her friends that\u2019s not an appropriate question to ask. Or even just something like \u201chow did your parents react when you came out?\u201d Like.. what?!? How is that your business? If you\u2019re asking, it\u2019s because on some level you know it\u2019s possible the reaction was bad. Why are you asking them to potentially relive a personal trauma to a stranger?\n\nIt\u2019s like the person becomes a zoo animal.", "Yeah, I can somewhat excuse strangers who might not have been able to tell they were making you uncomfortable, but your bestie should have been able to tell. It was her place to step in and she didn't.", "I think that a lot people think that it's equivalent of asking someone with a traditional job \" what's the worst customer you've ever had?\" Sorry, thats the only explanation i can come up with. You can tell me to get back in my ace corner if you think I'm wrong.", "I'm so glad I found this reply because this is exactly what I was thinking as well. I honestly think that if someone told me that this was their previous job then they would be open to questions about it. People are naturally curious about things of which they have no knowledge. If you're uncomfortable answering questions that's also completely up to you, but maybe let someone know before you snap?\n\nIt seems like OP wants being an escort to be no big deal but also resents talking about it? Now, not that I think all of those questions are/were appropriate but some people just don't realise what they are \\*actually\\* asking when they ask \"what is the worst...\" etc.\n\nSo honestly, same as Lilcya, unless you said \"Actually, I would rather not talk about this\" before you snapped then YTA.", "Exactly what I was thinking. Just say to them you would really like to change the subject and not answer questions anymore. Normal people will stop if you ask nicely. I mean, they are just questions out of curiosity. You don't have to teach them manners, just to be clear about your boundaries.", "Or my favorite is when they think you hit your shelf after 25, that all clients want barely legals which is definitely not true. \n\nMy retiring was not because im \"now too old\" its because i personally outgrew it(i know many older women who make bank and did way better than i ever did. Plus they get better clients alot of the time, younger ladies have to be more careful bc creeps go after the younger ones bc they think they can take advantage )  .", "Ahhh madonna-whore complex much? My guess is youll want to hook up with \"slutty\" women, marry a virgin or near virgin, then when she only does lights off  quiet (to not wake the baby) missionary only when she wants to get pregnant  you'll go back to \"slutty\" women and be the type to say \"boohoo my wife wont fuck me anymore boohoo my wife is a prude boohoo wife wont do *insert fetish*\" then have a pichahu face wondering why. Men with the madonna whore complex are always baffled why their asexual wives dont become sex goddesses after signing the dotted line on the wedding certificate  \n\nMen like you were my bread and butter in college,  so i cant hate on you too much \n\n1.. Im already in a relationship \n\n2. Being a sex worker doesnt mean you want hook-ups (not that theres anything wrong with them ofcourse). Work is work, personal is personal. \n\nStay off tinder and maybe try christianmingles instead?", "Former sex worker here- their reactions are exactly why I choose not to disclose a lot of the time. It\u2019s easier now that I\u2019m old- people shudder to think of the details now that I\u2019m not the spank material I apparently was at 25 but I\u2019ve never been ashamed of how I paid for my education- but the being \u201cothered\u201d this way is just so irritating and gross. You did the correct thing BTW - I wish I\u2019d been this clever the times it\u2019s happened to me. \n\nNTA", "Whether or not something is a teaching moment is the decision of the potential teacher, no one else\u2019s. It\u2019s a nice thing to do for people, but absolutely not an obligation. NTA", "Lol. Never drew that parallel, you could be right!", "Yeah I assume they're just being naive and are expecting a funny story about a client with smelly feet or bad breath or who said something weird during sex.\n\nWould it be better to ask what your funniest experience was, instead? If they're trying to fish for interesting stories (and as with all customer-facing jobs I'm assuming you have some!) then they need to be much more polite and understanding about it. And it should be an opportunity for you to share something you enjoyed, not a traumatic experience.", ">Who\u2019s the worst person you slept with?\n\nBold of you to assume they have ever had the secks.", "Lol explains a lot"]}
