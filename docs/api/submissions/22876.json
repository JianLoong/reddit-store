She said im like an \"ambassador \" for people in my trade and taught them better. \n\nI told her \"first off it was their parents job to teach them manners, not mine.

YTA.\n\nImportant to keep in mind too, the current societal rhetoric is that sex work is literally just a job like any other. So asking relevant questions is something they're being taught is ok.

Don't passive aggressively answer the question, and then a few more, and then get mad about it.\n\nThere are plenty of current and ex sex workers that would find these questions tame.

You don't answer them anyway and then get mad that they were asked. Have some autonomy. \n\nI've had \"girls nights\" where questions like these (just change \"client\" to \"ex\") and even more specific ones were asked, and I didn't think it was rude. Everyone has different comfort levels, and that's where it's your responsibility to be clear about your expectations. You brought it up, you answered some questions. Those are both indicators that you were ok with it, and from what you wrote, the got less tame after you were already answering them. So that implies they thought you were ok with it based on your actions. \n\nIn one of your other comments you say that asking wage for ANY job is rude. There are actually studies that show being transparent about wage is a positive thing that could improve lives.

OP isn't even an escort anymore, its more than likely something they didn't enjoy doing, it was out of necessity. \n\nThere is a difference between giving a polite response in a conversation and pestering someone with a million questions.  There's obviously some things about OP's past career that they are ok with talking about, so it's not as easy as just saying \"this makes me uncomfortable, lets not talk about it.\" It should have been obvious to them that OP was getting agitated. A big part of conversing with people is picking up on subtle social cues, I'm sure you can find a lot of info about that in etiquette manuals as well. I wouldn't say OP was passive aggressive as all, it seemed pretty obvious she didn't want to have this conversation.", "What OP did was respectfully humor people stomping her boundaries because she didn't want to make waves in a new social circle. People are responsible for their own behavior, not other people's. It's not polite to ask someone you don't know about the details of their sexual history, and the fact that no one took the hint things were getting personal when she rebuffed the question about getting hurt is indicative of the entire issue.", "Doesnt matter whom you have sex with (under consensual adult circumstances), its not okay to ask a stranger such intrusive questions, period.", "Guys, we found one of the roomates.", "And that\u2019s fine but it was an intimate setting with a group of girls talking it\u2019s not like they just walked up to her at Walmart.

Say so. Change the subject. Move on. \n\nContinuing to have a conversation that you don't want to have while stewing in your brain about it *is* passive aggressive. \n\nSome people are on the spectrum, have other cognitive or learning challenges, or simply aren't as observant - being subtle about a boundary (and by subtle, I mean not communicating it at ALL) is a surefire way to ensure people cross said boundary. She's ok with some questions but not others - how on earth are they supposed to know which ones unless she says \"oh, that question is uncomfortable for me.\" \n\nNevermind that OP lashed out AFTER the subject had actually been changed, so there was no reason to continue being defensive.", "Answering questions implies you're ok with the questions.\n\nIt's not \"details of your sexual history\" it's details of a job.
