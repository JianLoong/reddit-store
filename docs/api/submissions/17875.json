I (19F) and him (20M), we\u2019ll call him John, dated for only six months about three months ago. Our relationship was rocky to say the least, misunderstandings of boundaries and goals from the start.

I could go further into detail about the situations but they\u2019re not super important to the story right now. \n\nNeither of us were the best and to say it was toxic is an understatement, so after the breakup I tried desperately to go no contact. This was followed by months and months of what I believe to be harassment, situations such as calling me on a blocked number hundreds of times, circling my neighborhood and home for hours, showing up to my work three times, and receiving unprovoked threats from his \u201cfriends,\u201d as well as him sending messages to mine. It eventually got to a point where my mom got involved and threatened to take action if John did not stop. So clearly we are not on speaking terms and I have spoken numerous times on how I would like to be left alone. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure how the calls go through or why, some people have said maybe it\u2019s a call now number or something, but they always show up as an unknown number. The past week I received two voicemails from him stating that he was in the hospital after a motorcycle accident. Despite sounding fine, he basically tried to make it seem like he was on his death bed in both voicemails. He wasn\u2019t. He punctured his lung but was otherwise okay and took the surgery well. But he practically threw a pity party upon himself and begged that I visit him, that he just needed to see me.\n\nAfter the months of uncomfortable situations being forced on me by this man, I declined respectfully VIA Instagram and blocked him shortly after, saying something along the lines of, \u201cI am sorry that happened to you but it is no excuse to weasel me into it. We are not friends and I have asked to be left alone. Hope you feel better. \n\nI got some passive aggressive response as if I was for some reason in the wrong for not visiting him on his \u201cdeath bed.\u201d Just by the way he was out partying a day or so after he got out, so I feel as if it was safe to assume he was alright. \n\nAITA for not going?

This was a three month relationship which is long over. This man was never your friend. This guy has a completely screwed over view on life and relationships.", "NTA. But please block him on everything. If he contacts you again, tell him you will get a restraining order. Document everything.", "NTA. You owe him nothing, not even an explanation. To paraphrase something I read on Tumblr once - If you can\u2019t rationalize something someone did to you, it\u2019s because you\u2019re not like them and that should be your closure.", "NTA.  You both are young, you dated, it did not work out, you split, but he could not let it go.  Change your phone number, e-mail address, social media accounts.  If then you still get harassing contact, go to the police (and keep your mother in the loop for your own good).", "NTA. Narcissists will use any means to contact you after you decide to break it off completely. Don\u2019t engage in ANY communication whatsoever; eventually it\u2019ll stop.", "NTA for not going. The relationship is over. He's playing the sympathy card trying to keep in contact with you. Don't fall for it.", "NTA.  He is a stalker. Do not respond in any way, even through friends except through an attorney\nEy.", "NTA\n\nThe relationship was bad, you broke up on bad terms and you want nothing to do with him. He's since begun stalking and harassing you. What he just did to you was trying to guilt trip you into seeing him, and he is probably hoping you feel bad enough that you'll get back with him.\n\nMy advice, if possible get a restraining order against him. If you can't, you need to report to the police every time he shows up and pulls his stalking crap. Even if the police just tell him off, they will have to write up a report about it. To which you can use against him later on to get a restraining order.", "People get stupid after a break up, particularly when you're young. There's no reason why you would need to visit an ex.\n\nBlock his texts and calls, ignore him, move on.", "NTA.  None of this was your fault.  Just keep blocking him and live your life.  Great job recognizing how toxic this relationship was so early on and not getting sucked in.", "NTA. He's your ex. Even if he were on his death bed, you have no obligation to visit him.\n\nHe doesn't \"feel this way\". He's trying everything he can to force you back to being with him. Document everything (by date and time), and save any texts. You may need police intervention if this continues. This sounds like stalking.", "NTA. Sounds like he is trying to manipulate you, and even if he wasn't and was literally dying, still NTA.", "NTA and look at getting an order of protection or restraining order. He is stalking you and if not addressed quickly and stopped it could be dangerous for you. Get some pepper spray and if you are comfortable a stun gun. \n\nYou don't owe him anything, his life is for him to live your life is for you.", "NTA.\n\nYou were this close to needing a restraining order before his accident. Opening that door even as much as you have is only going to lead to him barging back in.", "NTA\n\nHe's trying to suck you back in. Stay strong! Don't fall for it!", "NTA. As you said, it was toxic , unhealthy and you all are not friends. He doesn't really feel that way- he is simply trying to manipulate you and get in your head.", "Omg. Not only are you NTA, you were super smart not to fall for this.  He may very well have been significantly injured, however, you are not his person.  You are not his girlfriend, his friend, or his family.  You can care what happens to him without actually being a part of his life.  Given the history you have with him, you absolutely, 100% made the right decision.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Things will escalate and he might get physical. You already have records of the escalation, that alone will grant you an order. Also, use the friends' comments and conversations so the system has a record of them being violent with words. Just in case it gets worse and one of them goes full on mercenary. Please take care of yourself."]}
