I was the one who found my mother\u2019s body after her extremely bloody death, so I\u2019m very sensitive to gore in general but especially blood. Just wanted to rip the bandaid off early.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve know \u2018Miranda\u2019 (17f) since the start of the school year, but we got pretty close in the last few months. She invited me to her birthday party last weekend, and told me in advance that the theme was \u2018murder mystery\u2019. I asked her for more specifics since I wasn\u2019t sure if I could handle it. She knows that I have issues with gore and blood, but not the extent of my trauma. She \u201cdidn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise\u201d but assured me that it would be pretty mild and not to worry about it. I decided to trust her.\n\nWell, I got dropped off at her house and chatted with the other guests on the patio while we waited for the last person to show up. When he did, we were all escorted together into the house by Miranda\u2019s sister, who said some rehearsed line about how she was \u201cso glad you detectives are here because there has been a murder\u201d. She escorted us to Miranda\u2019s room where Miranda was laying on her bed all done up in fake blood with a fake knife sticking out of her chest.\n\nI knew it was fake, obviously, but in that moment my brain short circuited. It was like I was thirteen years old again and had just lost a person who meant the world to me. I wanted to scream and cry and run away, but instead I excused myself and fast walked out of the room. I hyperventilated on her patio as I texted my dad and waited for him to get there. A few of my friends came out to see what was wrong, and I tried to play it off. I told them I was fine and that they should go back to the party, but they insisted on sitting with me until my dad arrived.\n\nAll this week at school Miranda gave me the cold shoulder, and she\u2019s been \u2018venting\u2019 to our other friends about how I caused a scene and took people away from the party and basically took fifteen minutes away from her party to make it all about me. According to her, \u201cthe makeup wasn\u2019t that gory, and [my name] was just being a drama queen.\u201d\n\nMy close friends (mostly the ones who know about my trauma) don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, but I still feel bad for disrupting her party.

It makes perfect sense that you couldn't think in the moment.  The fact that you walked out and just texted for a ride says just how far you've come in your recovery. \n\nYour REAL friends understand what you went through.  Miranda isn't a real friend and you were NOT being a drama queen.", "NTA. The fact that she wanted it to be a surprise means she knew what she was going to do was wrong. She is not your friend. She wanted a reaction out of you, and you left instead of making a scene. I hope no one ever does that to you again.", "absolutely NTA. I'm so sorry this happened to you. You did everything you could to make sure you could handle it and she lied. She needed to give you those specifics instead of worrying about spoiling it. You guys are young and I can understand her ignorance of your situation. Please don't be hard on yourself. PTSD is hard to manage especially in a scenario like this where you've prepared yourself for something mild, then you see that. Your friend needs to be a little more understanding but unfortunately it's hard for a lot of people to understand when they haven't been through something first hand. Look out for number one first and foremost-- that's you. Flashbacks are intense. I found when I have one I was more prone to them in days that followed. I hope you have some people you can lean on if you need it.", "NTA OP.  MIRANDA, however, is.  She apparently doesn\u2019t understand PTSD and triggers, and yet she subjected you to a murder mystery, with her as the victim?  I\u2019d recommend getting her out of your life.", "NTA. It sounds like Miranda set you up on purpose. She is not a real friend.", "NTA- you asked questions to see if this event would be gore-filled and were assured it would be tame and you had nothing to worry about. It did have gore and gave you a panic attack. You excused yourself politely, and tried to go home without causing a scene. Your real friends were legitimately concerned about leaving you alone while you were in this state (which was a valid, compassionate response). \n\nI want to be very clear. You did not cause a scene. You removed yourself from a situation that was too much for you. 15 mins of attention is more important to Miranda than your well being. If I did something that accidentally triggered one of my friends, the whole party would've stopped until I was sure they were okay, because a friend is more important than a party theme. I would be the one calling their emergency contact and making sure they got home safe. Id call again after the party to check in and make sure they're okay. I would feel apologetic, even though some triggers are just a part of living that we have to learn to deal with (unfortunately, we cannot rid the world of all blood, you'll encounter this trigger from time to time).\n\nI wouldn't be calling her your friend anymore.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI have PTSD too and know how horrifying it feels when I get triggered. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that, and how you were treated by her later. \n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty. You tried your best. Maybe she needs to learn empathy though.", "NTA. That would disturb me and I don't have any kind of trauma. I wouldn't have a reaction like yours, which wasn't even extreme given your circumstances, but I wouldn't be thrilled. Miranda was thoughtless to spring that on you and is vicious to make your trauma response all about her.", "NTA. Source: I'm a trauma therapist.\n\nIs this person usually a good friend or is this behavior par for the course? It sounds like she doesn't know anything about how PTSD and triggers work. I'm trying to understand how much of her behavior is ignorance and how much of it is selfish cruelty. Either way, you did absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nI hope you are doing alright this week and have a good support system. It's normal to have some after effects in the 1 or 2 weeks following a bad flashback, so please be gentle with yourself. It can be hard to hold boundaries around triggers, but I hope this incident helps you feel a little more comfortable advocating for yourself in the future, to make sure you have all the info you need to make an informed decision about whether a situation is safe for you.", "mild YTA  Next time you're invited to a murder mystery themed party, don't go.", "I'm also upset with the friends that stayed with her - personally someone watching me fall apart makes it much worse and if I told someone to go back to the party and they insisted on sitting with me it would make my anxiety skyrocket- being alone would help me calm down so much more.  Can't people just listen to what the person experiencing the issue actually wants?  Knowing everyone at the party knows you are freaking out isn't going to help anyone.", "And your friends are on your side. They probably knew as soon as they saw the scene that it was going to be a trigger for you, and they knew Miranda was being a jerk by putting you in that situation. You behaved VERY calmly: you weren\u2019t dramatic at all. And if the party was ruined, it was because your friends were pissed at your inconsiderate host, not because of anything you did.", "That would be ideal, but these are teenagers. They know their friend was triggered, and they were trying to support her until her dad got there. They are still children who are learning how to help others through their emotions, and even if their response isn\u2019t perfect, they\u2019re clearly coming from a place of love.", "It\u2019s so hard though. Teen girls and women are hardwired to be supportive and gently push past your walls to help. Good or bad, that\u2019s sort of a common personality type. And then you have men, whose friends\u2019 respect boundaries, but who also have an objectively observable deficit of support systems and a hesitancy to seek out help.", "I think it depends on OP's body language and responses afterwards. OP clearly didn't want to detract from the party, but I think it's very reasonable from the perspective of their friends to be more concerned about their friend having a panic attack than a birthday party. I find this situation very tricky because of course you should respect people's boundaries and their requests, but depending on how OP is and how well their friends know them, it could be an act of care. \n\nMy boyfriend (I also do this sometimes) for example will absolutely tell me to not worry about him and enjoy myself if we're out or seeing friends, but I know he'd actually feel better if I told him I'd rather be with him and get him out of his head a bit or validate his feelings.\n\nHopefully this is the case, but if OP felt worse and their friends ignored it or were oblivious I'm very sorry they had to go through that.", "NTA\n\nIn general I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to ambush people with a game like this; they don\u2019t need to know all the details, but \u201cmy party we\u2019re going to pretend someone was murdered and solve who did it\u201d would have been appropriate.\n\nSaying a party has a theme is not the same thing as expecting people to participate in a kind of live action role play experience. \n\nYou told Miranda you weren\u2019t sure you were going to be able to handle it - she clearly doesn\u2019t take your issues with blood seriously.\n\nNot telling you what the party actually was going to be was certainly a misstep, but her behavior after is what puts her firmly in the asshole camp.\n\nInstead of recognizing that she was wrong, that her assessment that it would be mild didn\u2019t take into account your tolerance is MUCH different than hers, that her staging triggered what sounds like a flashback (and from an outsiders perspective, at least a panic attack) and apologizing\u2026\n\nShe insults you and is smearing you to her friends.\n\nAnd in my opinion even if your trauma wasn\u2019t related to finding your mother\u2019s body, Miranda would STILL be an asshole.\n\nBecause you told her you couldn\u2019t handle blood and you tried to get more information to decide if it was something you could do - and she hid that information.\n\nI know it\u2019s years past, but I am so sorry for what happened to you OP. No one should experience that let alone a child.", "You did nothing wrong NTA", "NTA. You were as polite about having to leave the room as you could be. And I can\u2019t imagine how you did that, so kudos to you for your strength.", "NAH\n\nPTSD is not a choice.\n\nYou aren\u2019t T A for leaving an event that triggered your PTSD. But neither is your friend for being upset about you making a scene (which you and your friends did - even though it wasn\u2019t by choice) at their birthday. Remember - your friend does not know you have PTSD. They do not know the background. You haven\u2019t chosen to share that information. So what they have - is you running out and others leaving with you. And they don\u2019t have an explanation for this that makes sense. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a matter of fault or being T A but - you could have made a more sensible decision to limit the chance of being triggered. Murder-Mystery events sounds like a poor choice for someone with PTSD linked to a violent death. That\u2019s information to keep in mind for the future for you. This is an event you probably should have opted out of. \n\nI acknowledge that you thought you were careful by asking about gore. But your friend doesn\u2019t know that you have PTSD and doesn\u2019t know it is linked to a violent death. They answered your questions honestly and sincerely. To them this likely wasn\u2019t much gore (to me it isn\u2019t either*). \n\nI think you need to have an honest discussion with your friend. I recommend apologising for the impact on their party. Not because you did anything wrong - but because you did have an impact. It\u2019s like - if I got sick at a friend\u2019s party I\u2019d be sorry I interrupted things. But I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty for being sick. \n\nI\u2019d recommend more openness about your situation as well. You could give part of the information. My mother died violently - I didn\u2019t expect it to happen but when I saw you even though I knew it was pretend it felt too real - I never wanted to disrupt your party so I didn\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t tell people because I don\u2019t want people to see me as the daughter of a media headline.  An honest explanation but without having to go through everything. \n\nHow much your share would depend on how close a friend this person is and how much your trust them to respect your privacy. I\u2019m working on the assumption this person is a friend. \n\nIf your friend is a decent person they will understand. But right now - what they can see from the information available - is you ran out - and a bunch of people (not just 1 by the sound if it) focused on you instead of the birthday person.  And from what they could tell - you were ok or just a little upset (probably because you were working hard not to disrupt their party! But they doing know that) It can be hard being the new person in a group of existing friends - and it can be easy to feel that you aren\u2019t important.\n\n* through my work I very occasionally deal with crime scenes (most of which are completely mundane) - I learnt the hard way not to answer curious questions from people honestly - as stuff that to me was low level could be really confronting for others.", "NTA", "NTA!

I commend you for how you handle yourself\u2026I know from experience how hard and painful it can be dealing with the triggers that come with PTSD.

Anyone who got explained to them OP's concerns, then went ahead with this plan intending to see Miranda in the bedroom tableau is a shit person, and being a teenager doesn't excuse anything.\n\nMy guess is that fewer people than expected found Miranda's stunt entertaining, and she's trying to get people \"on her side\" about what she did.  \n\nI hope OP is doing okay, and that people (classmates, etc.) become aware of Miranda's crappy behavior.", "eh, agreeing to go to a murder party was probably not the best idea.

All she has to do now is shut up about it and move on. 15 minutes of her party, in fact, did not take away from her party. \n\nLose this dead weight. You don't need the drama or the lack of support.", "NTA, but cut your friend some slack. She's a child, and we all went through a self\u2010centered stage at that age.\n\nMaybe call her and apologize that it had a negative effect on the party, but give her a better explanation of your reaction.", "NTA", "Nta\n\nMiranda clearly doesn\u2019t get the situation, you could have someone gently tell her there\u2019s more to it and please stop.", "Ok, but the thing is that even though it was a murder mystery party it didn\u2019t have to be gory at all, that was a choice Miranda made alongside her choice to keep the extent secret from OP. I\u2019ve been to these kinds of parties before, and they\u2019ve been set up more like an escape room, with clues and puzzles scattered throughout the house. And Miranda *did* know that OP doesn\u2019t like gore, she doesn\u2019t have to know everything; if she really wanted to be a good friend she would have told OP this party probably wasn\u2019t for her and they\u2019d hang out another time. With respect, you\u2019re coming at this as an adult who deals with gore regularly. I had a friend with arachnophobia as a teen (I know it\u2019s different), and regularly pre-screened movies/killed the buggers at sleepovers. Teen girls will move mountains for their friends, Miranda just doesn\u2019t seem to value OP that way. NTA, and I hope you are ok going forward OP. PS also if you haven\u2019t told an adult yet you might want to do that. Your dad, a trusted teacher. You had a major triggering event, and she\u2019s calling you a drama queen. You don\u2019t have to handle everything alone if it gets to be too much.", "Holy shit NTA!!!!!!!\n\nI hadn\u2019t seen what you did by 16 and that would have traumatized me simply because I have never liked horror sort of stuff. \n\nShe knew you had ptsd and your history. \n\nMiranda is a massive cruel self centred asshole. \n\nShe is not your friend. She needs it to be all about her", "NTA... sorry", "NTA, but I'm not sure she is either, PTSD is a serious condition, so I will NEVER shame you for getting triggered like this, if anything you managed it quite well.  Whether she is TA in this situation depends on how much she knows about your specific trauma, if she didn't know the circumstances of your mother's death and your involvement in it at such a tender age (which IS possible since you've only known each other for a year according to this post) then this was an honest mistake and a proper explanation SHOULD sort everything out.  If she DID know about what happened to your mother, OR if she learns about it and is still angry at you afterword, then she would be TA for sure.", "Tbf it doesn't sound like Miranda knows OP *has* PTSD or actual triggers. There's a huge difference in expectations for reactions between \"I have a friend who doesn't like blood\" and \"I have a friend who found her mom's bloody corpse.\" In her mind, the murder setup WAS mild and obviously fake, AND she gave fair warning so OP had time to prepare herself, and so OP's reaction to it was fully unexpected.\n\nAlso, like ... she's a teenager. She's still learning how to deal with other people in general, much less people with diagnosable problems.\n\nThat being said, OP doesn't owe anyone an explanation of her trauma, and even if it was a simple case of \"I don't like blood and this is too much for me\" she 100% has the right to quietly peace out, so Miranda is definitely overreacting even with what little information she was working with.\n\nSo NTA but this is a potential learning moment for both of them: OP for managing her own triggers (ie not trusting what *someone else* thinks is mild, especially if that person doesn't know the extent of her issues) and Miranda for believing someone who says they can't handle stuff and extending grace to someone who is overwhelmed for whatever reason.", "Hope op is doing OK now. Sending virtual hugs", "This is the best response I have read to this so far. Woefully underrated. \n\nThe person who threw the party has her priorities all out of whack, which can be expected for some teenage girls, I guess.\n\nIn this day and age, attention is like a currency that gives us all these feelings of validation and serotonin boosts and for 15 minutes she perceives you robbed from her the attention that was rightfully hers that she expected, planned and worked for.\n\nThis is of course a complete selfish and self-centered view of things and totally lacking in compassion and thinking of others.\n\nThis person is not a good friend to anyone. \n\nNTA", "Idk. A 16 year old who was told OP had seen their mother after a bloody death should be able to understand that OP wouldn\u2019t cope with walking to a room seeing a body covered in blood.", "I would want to be sure my friend was safe if they were hyperventilating and eating for their dad.", "I get that. But also some people want to stay and make sure you\u2019re OK and think someone freaking out shouldn\u2019t be alone. I\u2019m not sure I could leave someone totally alone that was freaking out. I would expect one person to stay with that person", "I\u2019m like the guy above. When I panic I want to be safe and alone and know I have not ruined anyone else\u2019s night. \n\nBut I\u2019m also an adult who has done lots of therapy, meds, courses to manage my ptsd and can communicate that clearly. \n\nI  honestly would feel uncomfortable leaving someone feeling out totally alone. I would want one person to be with them", "Dude I loved how my awkward AF brother handled my worst depression, he would awkwardly follow me around and be like \"did you eat yet?\"      \n\n\nThe following was constant. Sometimes we spoke. Sometimes he just awkwardly sat there as a comforting presence I guess?", "Some people are also conditioned to not make waves. There have definitely been times in my life when I\u2019ve needed support and been offered it, but declined because I felt bad about bothering other people with my issues. It can be hard to tell if a person is declining support because they really do want to be left alone or because they don\u2019t want to bother other people.", ">Especially when you know that someone attending is triggered by bloody violence.\n\nShe didn't, though. OP says Miranda doesn't know about her trauma. \n\nMiranda is definitely in the wrong for the way she's acting now, but that doesn't mean that she, a teenager who doesn't know her friend's history, understands yet that *her* version of \"mild\" is not OP's version of \"mild\".", "NTA You warned Miranda and she lied to you and now she is dissing you instead of being genuinely concerned about your panic attack. She is not your friend.", "N t a", "Sweetheart, you cannot be blamed for flashing back to a trauma like that. It hasn't even been that long.\n\nI'm so sorry you lost your mother so horribly, and also that someone you thought was a friend doesn't understand that pain. \n\nNTA. May your heart and mind find peace.", "NTA. This person is not your friend", "INFO: you said she doesn't know the extent to your trauma during the incident. When she was giving you the cold shoulder did she know?", "NTA. Miranda sucks and you don't need them in your life.", "This 100%. I'm sure that this entire conflict stemmed from a misunderstanding, one because Miranda actually didn't know the true reason behind OP's nausea with blood, and two because OP and Miranda had different ideas of what \"too gory\" was.", "Either way you are NTA btw, but resolving this conflict and getting a verdict on your friends ass meter really depends on this point.\n\nYou said she knew you weren't good with gore and blood, but for all we know she could be thinking that it's the common type of discomfort that makes you woozy. This is completely different from your actual case of having PTSD from seeing your mother in such a horrific state.", "I wouldn't go as far as jumping to the conclusion that Miranda isn't her friend because she doesn't understand the gravity of a mental health condition at the age of 17. Maybe Miranda isn't a great friend, but we can't villanize a teenager for this lack of ability. \n\nI have PTSd, and some of my friends understand trauma, but only some can really grasp PTSd. It's not an easy task to describe what an episode can truly feel like, especially since ptsd isn't a mind so much as a CNS/body issue, and sometimes the empathy isn't there. \n\nAs time has gone on, more friends and family understand, but we can't expect an immature teenager to have these abilities.", "Yes, how *dare* teenagers show concern and care for a friend in a way that **might** be slightly inappropriate because you would hate that.\n\n/s", "You missed the point. From what OP wrote, it seems like her friend doesn\u2019t know about finding her mom. The friend only knows she doesn\u2019t like blood and gore. I think what the friend did is still in bad taste considering what she did know, but it\u2019s not as egregious as you make it out to be.", "I\u2019m just wondering when murder party started meaning you find someone acting as an actual dead body. When I was younger I went to a couple murder parties and they were all pre scripted things about dressing up and playing characters, but the actual murder occurred off screen.", "Yeah OK. Fair point. She didn\u2019t know the extend of her trauma. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s not as bad or mean as I thought. \n\nSo the set up wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought. Sort of. \n\nBut the doubling down and being mean at school is bad. \n\nOP didn\u2019t spoil her party. She tried to leave quietly. Others knew her trauma though.", "Yeah, Miranda is being a jerk after. But she\u2019s also a teenager and probably doesn\u2019t understand exactly what she did. I imagine when she\u2019s older and reflects on this experience she will cringe hard.", "Yeah you\u2019re right. \n\nI think based on my ptsd I got so upset for OP\n\nTeenagers have asshole and selfish mode built in. Hopefully Miranda has a sensible adult who can explain where she went wrong and that no one is really an asshole. It was just very unfortunate choices.", "NTA, but not that smart, either. Why on earth would you go to an event YOU KNOW is a murder mystery without more details? Describing what would you see as \"pretty mild\" is COMPLETELY subjective. If your friend wasn't willing to give you more details, you should've politely declined and made your excuses/lies or told her the truth.\n\nIn the future, don't RSVP yes to events with \"murder\" or other associated words in the title.\n\nHere's a list: https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/murder", "Let me tell you something I wish I had figured out a long time ago - stop playing it off. It\u2019s good that your friends followed you and checked that you were okay. You weren\u2019t and you needed support and care. You deserve support and care. You can not push through / muscle through/ stubborn through. I thought I could and here I am, nearly 40, finally having to deal with my trauma and the years of not caring for have made it so much worse. Always take the time to make yourself truly safe and not just seem okay to others. If that means a friend sitting with you while you wait for your dad, so be it. In this case it definitely means removing people from your life who harm you, whether they understand what they did or not. NTA.", "NTA you handled that situation way better than anyone could have expected. You are allowed to scream and cry when you\u2019re triggered I think. Suppressing doesn\u2019t seem like the right path. But I\u2019m not a therapist or such. I am wishing you all the best and better friends overall.", "NTA. You politely excused yourself and weren't being dramatic.", "So why go to a murder mystery when u got to see a crime seen. This is just attention seeking and been dramatic to have a valid excuse to be angry at a friend. What next u see red wall and start screaming it's blood.", "She didnt even tell Miranda that she had PTSD, just that she had issues with blood and gore. It is kind of logical for someone to be angrily confused if they think someone just has a weak stomach/scares easily and decided to come to a low-budget murder mystery party. OP needs to communicate that her trauma is very serious so people can understand and that even the smallest bit of blood/gore will be triggering for her. I dont think it's fair for someone to have to guess that.", "\"What she did\"? She SAID it was a murder mystery event. Do you not know what that means? It's not a \"stunt\". It's a thing that people do - and even buy tickets for when it's done professionally. Dinners, parties, theater shows, etc., all can revolve around something like this. Miranda did nothing wrong. OP should've pushed for more details, or opted out.", "NTA. Of course not. I am so sorry for your loss and for the circumstances around it as well. Love and healing light to you. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9a\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c", "NTA. Miranda clearly has no idea of what triggers are and she should have given you specific details. I'm so sorry this happened. You weren't being dramatic at all.", "Exactly. I have a feeling that the friend will be mortified when she looks back on this incident twenty years from now. Teenagers rarely understand extreme trauma bc most haven't had to deal with it yet in their short lives, plus their worlds all revolve around themselves for the most part. That said, this \"friend\" isn't acting like someone I would want in my life. It's one thing to not understand PTSD or triggers, but it's a whole other ballgame to shit talk someone you've accidentally triggered.", "Ya, this sounds like NAH to me.  Miranda didn't do this maliciously and didn't know the extent of OPs trauma.  Miranda giving OP the cold shoulder after the fact is kinda dickish but not out of line from a 17yr old who thought they were throwing an interesting party.  Largely a learning experience for a group of 17yr olds.", "I mean, Miranda knows she has issues with blood and gore \u2014 she just doesn\u2019t know the extent of it.\n\nA knife in the chest and covered in fake blood around it isn\u2019t \u201cpretty mild.\u201d"]}
