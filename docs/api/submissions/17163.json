I was the one who found my mother\u2019s body after her extremely bloody death, so I\u2019m very sensitive to gore in general but especially blood. Just wanted to rip the bandaid off early.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve know \u2018Miranda\u2019 (17f) since the start of the school year, but we got pretty close in the last few months. She invited me to her birthday party last weekend, and told me in advance that the theme was \u2018murder mystery\u2019. I asked her for more specifics since I wasn\u2019t sure if I could handle it. She knows that I have issues with gore and blood, but not the extent of my trauma. She \u201cdidn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise\u201d but assured me that it would be pretty mild and not to worry about it. I decided to trust her.\n\nWell, I got dropped off at her house and chatted with the other guests on the patio while we waited for the last person to show up. When he did, we were all escorted together into the house by Miranda\u2019s sister, who said some rehearsed line about how she was \u201cso glad you detectives are here because there has been a murder\u201d. She escorted us to Miranda\u2019s room where Miranda was laying on her bed all done up in fake blood with a fake knife sticking out of her chest.\n\nI knew it was fake, obviously, but in that moment my brain short circuited. It was like I was thirteen years old again and had just lost a person who meant the world to me. I wanted to scream and cry and run away, but instead I excused myself and fast walked out of the room. I hyperventilated on her patio as I texted my dad and waited for him to get there. A few of my friends came out to see what was wrong, and I tried to play it off. I told them I was fine and that they should go back to the party, but they insisted on sitting with me until my dad arrived.\n\nAll this week at school Miranda gave me the cold shoulder, and she\u2019s been \u2018venting\u2019 to our other friends about how I caused a scene and took people away from the party and basically took fifteen minutes away from her party to make it all about me. According to her, \u201cthe makeup wasn\u2019t that gory, and [my name] was just being a drama queen.\u201d\n\nMy close friends (mostly the ones who know about my trauma) don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, but I still feel bad for disrupting her party.

What your friend did was in extremely poor taste and very insensitive to you. You handled it beautifully, in the least dramatic way as possible. It's too bad your friend is lacking in maturity and empathy. Otherwise she might be a lot more understanding towards you.", "NTA. Even if she didn't know the full extent of your trauma, she knew that you had a huge problem with blood and gore and still misled you into thinking that it wouldn't be hardly any of that. She's the AH.", "NTA. I feel really sorry for you that this happened and that your 'friend' didn't take you seriously at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes she know what caused the trauma? How you found your mom? It might be worth talking to her and explaining why you responded the way you did if you feel comfortable enough to talk about it. If you aren't, then it might be time to cut this 'friend' out. You had a trauma response and your friend is saying you are being a 'drama queen'. Thankfully, being in your high school teen years, this will blow over as time goes on so I wouldn't worry to much about any social issues at school over it (especially since a lot of them tend to not carry over to much after you leave school after senior year unless you are in a small enough town that everyone then goes to the exact same college)", "NTA.    You were not being \u2018dramatic\u2019 and you did not ruin anything.   You are an amazing person.", "NTA. You already warned her that you might not be able to handle it, and she was aware that you had issues with blood and gore, but she still took the risk because she didn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise. I think it\u2019s very mean and inconsiderate of her the way she's making you feel.", "NTA, but I'm going to give you some advice. You can't take people's word for \"how gory\" something may be. It's an incredibly subjective thing to try to gauge.  It's like asking \"Is this shower too hot, too cold, or just right?\" Everyone who steps into the shower is going to have a different opinion. Next time you're in this type of situation, maybe you should ask, \"Is there any blood?\" If yes, even a little bit, it's not the event for you. Best of luck.", "NTA. She is NOT your friend.", "I\u2019m am so sorry for your tragic loss and the trauma surrounding it. Please know you are NTA. Your friend is young and self-centered (as many teens are), and lacks empathy regarding your experiences. Please know that you did nothing wrong. Likely your friend feels stupid for making the plans that she did, but is putting the blame on you because she is embarrassed.", "NTA I also have ptsd but that\u2019s fucking awful your friend would have that theme like wtf", "NTA!!! \n\nAre you sure your friend didn't do this deliberately to try and get back at you over some perceived slight, jealousy, envy, or something along those lines?

It makes perfect sense that you couldn't think in the moment.  The fact that you walked out and just texted for a ride says just how far you've come in your recovery. \n\nYour REAL friends understand what you went through.  Miranda isn't a real friend and you were NOT being a drama queen.", "NTA. The fact that she wanted it to be a surprise means she knew what she was going to do was wrong. She is not your friend. She wanted a reaction out of you, and you left instead of making a scene. I hope no one ever does that to you again.", "absolutely NTA. I'm so sorry this happened to you. You did everything you could to make sure you could handle it and she lied. She needed to give you those specifics instead of worrying about spoiling it. You guys are young and I can understand her ignorance of your situation. Please don't be hard on yourself. PTSD is hard to manage especially in a scenario like this where you've prepared yourself for something mild, then you see that. Your friend needs to be a little more understanding but unfortunately it's hard for a lot of people to understand when they haven't been through something first hand. Look out for number one first and foremost-- that's you. Flashbacks are intense. I found when I have one I was more prone to them in days that followed. I hope you have some people you can lean on if you need it."]}
