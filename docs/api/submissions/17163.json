I was the one who found my mother\u2019s body after her extremely bloody death, so I\u2019m very sensitive to gore in general but especially blood. Just wanted to rip the bandaid off early.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve know \u2018Miranda\u2019 (17f) since the start of the school year, but we got pretty close in the last few months. She invited me to her birthday party last weekend, and told me in advance that the theme was \u2018murder mystery\u2019. I asked her for more specifics since I wasn\u2019t sure if I could handle it. She knows that I have issues with gore and blood, but not the extent of my trauma. She \u201cdidn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise\u201d but assured me that it would be pretty mild and not to worry about it. I decided to trust her.\n\nWell, I got dropped off at her house and chatted with the other guests on the patio while we waited for the last person to show up. When he did, we were all escorted together into the house by Miranda\u2019s sister, who said some rehearsed line about how she was \u201cso glad you detectives are here because there has been a murder\u201d. She escorted us to Miranda\u2019s room where Miranda was laying on her bed all done up in fake blood with a fake knife sticking out of her chest.\n\nI knew it was fake, obviously, but in that moment my brain short circuited. It was like I was thirteen years old again and had just lost a person who meant the world to me. I wanted to scream and cry and run away, but instead I excused myself and fast walked out of the room. I hyperventilated on her patio as I texted my dad and waited for him to get there. A few of my friends came out to see what was wrong, and I tried to play it off. I told them I was fine and that they should go back to the party, but they insisted on sitting with me until my dad arrived.\n\nAll this week at school Miranda gave me the cold shoulder, and she\u2019s been \u2018venting\u2019 to our other friends about how I caused a scene and took people away from the party and basically took fifteen minutes away from her party to make it all about me. According to her, \u201cthe makeup wasn\u2019t that gory, and [my name] was just being a drama queen.\u201d\n\nMy close friends (mostly the ones who know about my trauma) don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, but I still feel bad for disrupting her party.

It's too bad your friend is lacking in maturity and empathy. Otherwise she might be a lot more understanding towards you.", "NTA.

She's the AH.", "NTA. I feel really sorry for you that this happened and that your 'friend' didn't take you seriously at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes she know what caused the trauma? How you found your mom? It might be worth talking to her and explaining why you responded the way you did if you feel comfortable enough to talk about it. If you aren't, then it might be time to cut this 'friend' out. You had a trauma response and your friend is saying you are being a 'drama queen'. Thankfully, being in your high school teen years, this will blow over as time goes on so I wouldn't worry to much about any social issues at school over it (especially since a lot of them tend to not carry over to much after you leave school after senior year unless you are in a small enough town that everyone then goes to the exact same college)", "NTA.    You were not being \u2018dramatic\u2019 and you did not ruin anything.   You are an amazing person.", "NTA. You already warned her that you might not be able to handle it, and she was aware that you had issues with blood and gore, but she still took the risk because she didn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise.

It's an incredibly subjective thing to try to gauge.  It's like asking \"Is this shower too hot, too cold, or just right?\" Everyone who steps into the shower is going to have a different opinion. Next time you're in this type of situation, maybe you should ask, \"Is there any blood?\" If yes, even a little bit, it's not the event for you. Best of luck.", "NTA. She is NOT your friend.", "I\u2019m am so sorry for your tragic loss and the trauma surrounding it. Please know you are NTA.

It makes perfect sense that you couldn't think in the moment.  The fact that you walked out and just texted for a ride says just how far you've come in your recovery. \n\nYour REAL friends understand what you went through.  Miranda isn't a real friend and you were NOT being a drama queen.", "NTA. The fact that she wanted it to be a surprise means she knew what she was going to do was wrong. She is not your friend. She wanted a reaction out of you, and you left instead of making a scene. I hope no one ever does that to you again.", "absolutely NTA. I'm so sorry this happened to you. You did everything you could to make sure you could handle it and she lied. She needed to give you those specifics instead of worrying about spoiling it. You guys are young and I can understand her ignorance of your situation. Please don't be hard on yourself. PTSD is hard to manage especially in a scenario like this where you've prepared yourself for something mild, then you see that. Your friend needs to be a little more understanding but unfortunately it's hard for a lot of people to understand when they haven't been through something first hand. Look out for number one first and foremost-- that's you. Flashbacks are intense. I found when I have one I was more prone to them in days that followed. I hope you have some people you can lean on if you need it.", "NTA OP.  MIRANDA, however, is.  She apparently doesn\u2019t understand PTSD and triggers, and yet she subjected you to a murder mystery, with her as the victim?  I\u2019d recommend getting her out of your life.", "NTA. It sounds like Miranda set you up on purpose. She is not a real friend.", "NTA- you asked questions to see if this event would be gore-filled and were assured it would be tame and you had nothing to worry about. It did have gore and gave you a panic attack. You excused yourself politely, and tried to go home without causing a scene. Your real friends were legitimately concerned about leaving you alone while you were in this state (which was a valid, compassionate response). \n\nI want to be very clear. You did not cause a scene. You removed yourself from a situation that was too much for you. 15 mins of attention is more important to Miranda than your well being. If I did something that accidentally triggered one of my friends, the whole party would've stopped until I was sure they were okay, because a friend is more important than a party theme. I would be the one calling their emergency contact and making sure they got home safe. Id call again after the party to check in and make sure they're okay. I would feel apologetic, even though some triggers are just a part of living that we have to learn to deal with (unfortunately, we cannot rid the world of all blood, you'll encounter this trigger from time to time).\n\nI wouldn't be calling her your friend anymore.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI have PTSD too and know how horrifying it feels when I get triggered. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that, and how you were treated by her later. \n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty. You tried your best. Maybe she needs to learn empathy though.", "NTA. That would disturb me and I don't have any kind of trauma. I wouldn't have a reaction like yours, which wasn't even extreme given your circumstances, but I wouldn't be thrilled. Miranda was thoughtless to spring that on you and is vicious to make your trauma response all about her.", "NTA. Source: I'm a trauma therapist.\n\nIs this person usually a good friend or is this behavior par for the course? It sounds like she doesn't know anything about how PTSD and triggers work. I'm trying to understand how much of her behavior is ignorance and how much of it is selfish cruelty. Either way, you did absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nI hope you are doing alright this week and have a good support system. It's normal to have some after effects in the 1 or 2 weeks following a bad flashback, so please be gentle with yourself. It can be hard to hold boundaries around triggers, but I hope this incident helps you feel a little more comfortable advocating for yourself in the future, to make sure you have all the info you need to make an informed decision about whether a situation is safe for you.", "mild YTA  Next time you're invited to a murder mystery themed party, don't go.", "I'm also upset with the friends that stayed with her - personally someone watching me fall apart makes it much worse and if I told someone to go back to the party and they insisted on sitting with me it would make my anxiety skyrocket- being alone would help me calm down so much more.  Can't people just listen to what the person experiencing the issue actually wants?  Knowing everyone at the party knows you are freaking out isn't going to help anyone.", "And your friends are on your side. They probably knew as soon as they saw the scene that it was going to be a trigger for you, and they knew Miranda was being a jerk by putting you in that situation. You behaved VERY calmly: you weren\u2019t dramatic at all. And if the party was ruined, it was because your friends were pissed at your inconsiderate host, not because of anything you did.", "That would be ideal, but these are teenagers. They know their friend was triggered, and they were trying to support her until her dad got there. They are still children who are learning how to help others through their emotions, and even if their response isn\u2019t perfect, they\u2019re clearly coming from a place of love.", "It\u2019s so hard though. Teen girls and women are hardwired to be supportive and gently push past your walls to help. Good or bad, that\u2019s sort of a common personality type. And then you have men, whose friends\u2019 respect boundaries, but who also have an objectively observable deficit of support systems and a hesitancy to seek out help.", "I think it depends on OP's body language and responses afterwards. OP clearly didn't want to detract from the party, but I think it's very reasonable from the perspective of their friends to be more concerned about their friend having a panic attack than a birthday party. I find this situation very tricky because of course you should respect people's boundaries and their requests, but depending on how OP is and how well their friends know them, it could be an act of care. \n\nMy boyfriend (I also do this sometimes) for example will absolutely tell me to not worry about him and enjoy myself if we're out or seeing friends, but I know he'd actually feel better if I told him I'd rather be with him and get him out of his head a bit or validate his feelings.\n\nHopefully this is the case, but if OP felt worse and their friends ignored it or were oblivious I'm very sorry they had to go through that."]}
