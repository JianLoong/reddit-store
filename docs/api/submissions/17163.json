I was the one who found my mother\u2019s body after her extremely bloody death, so I\u2019m very sensitive to gore in general but especially blood. Just wanted to rip the bandaid off early.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve know \u2018Miranda\u2019 (17f) since the start of the school year, but we got pretty close in the last few months. She invited me to her birthday party last weekend, and told me in advance that the theme was \u2018murder mystery\u2019. I asked her for more specifics since I wasn\u2019t sure if I could handle it. She knows that I have issues with gore and blood, but not the extent of my trauma. She \u201cdidn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise\u201d but assured me that it would be pretty mild and not to worry about it. I decided to trust her.\n\nWell, I got dropped off at her house and chatted with the other guests on the patio while we waited for the last person to show up. When he did, we were all escorted together into the house by Miranda\u2019s sister, who said some rehearsed line about how she was \u201cso glad you detectives are here because there has been a murder\u201d. She escorted us to Miranda\u2019s room where Miranda was laying on her bed all done up in fake blood with a fake knife sticking out of her chest.\n\nI knew it was fake, obviously, but in that moment my brain short circuited. It was like I was thirteen years old again and had just lost a person who meant the world to me. I wanted to scream and cry and run away, but instead I excused myself and fast walked out of the room. I hyperventilated on her patio as I texted my dad and waited for him to get there. A few of my friends came out to see what was wrong, and I tried to play it off. I told them I was fine and that they should go back to the party, but they insisted on sitting with me until my dad arrived.\n\nAll this week at school Miranda gave me the cold shoulder, and she\u2019s been \u2018venting\u2019 to our other friends about how I caused a scene and took people away from the party and basically took fifteen minutes away from her party to make it all about me. According to her, \u201cthe makeup wasn\u2019t that gory, and [my name] was just being a drama queen.\u201d\n\nMy close friends (mostly the ones who know about my trauma) don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, but I still feel bad for disrupting her party.

Thankfully, being in your high school teen years, this will blow over as time goes on so I wouldn't worry to much about any social issues at school over it (especially since a lot of them tend to not carry over to much after you leave school after senior year unless you are in a small enough town that everyone then goes to the exact same college)", "NTA.

It makes perfect sense that you couldn't think in the moment.  The fact that you walked out and just texted for a ride says just how far you've come in your recovery. \n\nYour REAL friends understand what you went through.  Miranda isn't a real friend and you were NOT being a drama queen.", "NTA. The fact that she wanted it to be a surprise means she knew what she was going to do was wrong. She is not your friend. She wanted a reaction out of you, and you left instead of making a scene. I hope no one ever does that to you again.", "absolutely NTA. I'm so sorry this happened to you. You did everything you could to make sure you could handle it and she lied. She needed to give you those specifics instead of worrying about spoiling it. You guys are young and I can understand her ignorance of your situation. Please don't be hard on yourself. PTSD is hard to manage especially in a scenario like this where you've prepared yourself for something mild, then you see that. Your friend needs to be a little more understanding but unfortunately it's hard for a lot of people to understand when they haven't been through something first hand. Look out for number one first and foremost-- that's you. Flashbacks are intense. I found when I have one I was more prone to them in days that followed. I hope you have some people you can lean on if you need it.", "NTA OP.  MIRANDA, however, is.  She apparently doesn\u2019t understand PTSD and triggers, and yet she subjected you to a murder mystery, with her as the victim?  I\u2019d recommend getting her out of your life.", "NTA. It sounds like Miranda set you up on purpose. She is not a real friend.", "NTA- you asked questions to see if this event would be gore-filled and were assured it would be tame and you had nothing to worry about. It did have gore and gave you a panic attack. You excused yourself politely, and tried to go home without causing a scene. Your real friends were legitimately concerned about leaving you alone while you were in this state (which was a valid, compassionate response). \n\nI want to be very clear. You did not cause a scene. You removed yourself from a situation that was too much for you. 15 mins of attention is more important to Miranda than your well being. If I did something that accidentally triggered one of my friends, the whole party would've stopped until I was sure they were okay, because a friend is more important than a party theme. I would be the one calling their emergency contact and making sure they got home safe. Id call again after the party to check in and make sure they're okay. I would feel apologetic, even though some triggers are just a part of living that we have to learn to deal with (unfortunately, we cannot rid the world of all blood, you'll encounter this trigger from time to time).\n\nI wouldn't be calling her your friend anymore.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI have PTSD too and know how horrifying it feels when I get triggered. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that, and how you were treated by her later. \n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty. You tried your best. Maybe she needs to learn empathy though.", "NTA. That would disturb me and I don't have any kind of trauma. I wouldn't have a reaction like yours, which wasn't even extreme given your circumstances, but I wouldn't be thrilled. Miranda was thoughtless to spring that on you and is vicious to make your trauma response all about her.", "NTA. Source: I'm a trauma therapist.\n\nIs this person usually a good friend or is this behavior par for the course? It sounds like she doesn't know anything about how PTSD and triggers work. I'm trying to understand how much of her behavior is ignorance and how much of it is selfish cruelty. Either way, you did absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nI hope you are doing alright this week and have a good support system. It's normal to have some after effects in the 1 or 2 weeks following a bad flashback, so please be gentle with yourself. It can be hard to hold boundaries around triggers, but I hope this incident helps you feel a little more comfortable advocating for yourself in the future, to make sure you have all the info you need to make an informed decision about whether a situation is safe for you.", "mild YTA  Next time you're invited to a murder mystery themed party, don't go.", "I'm also upset with the friends that stayed with her - personally someone watching me fall apart makes it much worse and if I told someone to go back to the party and they insisted on sitting with me it would make my anxiety skyrocket- being alone would help me calm down so much more.  Can't people just listen to what the person experiencing the issue actually wants?  Knowing everyone at the party knows you are freaking out isn't going to help anyone.", "And your friends are on your side. They probably knew as soon as they saw the scene that it was going to be a trigger for you, and they knew Miranda was being a jerk by putting you in that situation. You behaved VERY calmly: you weren\u2019t dramatic at all. And if the party was ruined, it was because your friends were pissed at your inconsiderate host, not because of anything you did.", "That would be ideal, but these are teenagers. They know their friend was triggered, and they were trying to support her until her dad got there. They are still children who are learning how to help others through their emotions, and even if their response isn\u2019t perfect, they\u2019re clearly coming from a place of love.", "It\u2019s so hard though. Teen girls and women are hardwired to be supportive and gently push past your walls to help. Good or bad, that\u2019s sort of a common personality type. And then you have men, whose friends\u2019 respect boundaries, but who also have an objectively observable deficit of support systems and a hesitancy to seek out help.", "I think it depends on OP's body language and responses afterwards. OP clearly didn't want to detract from the party, but I think it's very reasonable from the perspective of their friends to be more concerned about their friend having a panic attack than a birthday party. I find this situation very tricky because of course you should respect people's boundaries and their requests, but depending on how OP is and how well their friends know them, it could be an act of care. \n\nMy boyfriend (I also do this sometimes) for example will absolutely tell me to not worry about him and enjoy myself if we're out or seeing friends, but I know he'd actually feel better if I told him I'd rather be with him and get him out of his head a bit or validate his feelings.\n\nHopefully this is the case, but if OP felt worse and their friends ignored it or were oblivious I'm very sorry they had to go through that.", "NTA\n\nIn general I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to ambush people with a game like this; they don\u2019t need to know all the details, but \u201cmy party we\u2019re going to pretend someone was murdered and solve who did it\u201d would have been appropriate.\n\nSaying a party has a theme is not the same thing as expecting people to participate in a kind of live action role play experience. \n\nYou told Miranda you weren\u2019t sure you were going to be able to handle it - she clearly doesn\u2019t take your issues with blood seriously.\n\nNot telling you what the party actually was going to be was certainly a misstep, but her behavior after is what puts her firmly in the asshole camp.\n\nInstead of recognizing that she was wrong, that her assessment that it would be mild didn\u2019t take into account your tolerance is MUCH different than hers, that her staging triggered what sounds like a flashback (and from an outsiders perspective, at least a panic attack) and apologizing\u2026\n\nShe insults you and is smearing you to her friends.\n\nAnd in my opinion even if your trauma wasn\u2019t related to finding your mother\u2019s body, Miranda would STILL be an asshole.\n\nBecause you told her you couldn\u2019t handle blood and you tried to get more information to decide if it was something you could do - and she hid that information.\n\nI know it\u2019s years past, but I am so sorry for what happened to you OP. No one should experience that let alone a child.", "You did nothing wrong NTA", "NTA. You were as polite about having to leave the room as you could be. And I can\u2019t imagine how you did that, so kudos to you for your strength.", "NAH\n\nPTSD is not a choice.\n\nYou aren\u2019t T A for leaving an event that triggered your PTSD. But neither is your friend for being upset about you making a scene (which you and your friends did - even though it wasn\u2019t by choice) at their birthday. Remember - your friend does not know you have PTSD. They do not know the background. You haven\u2019t chosen to share that information. So what they have - is you running out and others leaving with you. And they don\u2019t have an explanation for this that makes sense. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a matter of fault or being T A but - you could have made a more sensible decision to limit the chance of being triggered. Murder-Mystery events sounds like a poor choice for someone with PTSD linked to a violent death. That\u2019s information to keep in mind for the future for you. This is an event you probably should have opted out of. \n\nI acknowledge that you thought you were careful by asking about gore. But your friend doesn\u2019t know that you have PTSD and doesn\u2019t know it is linked to a violent death. They answered your questions honestly and sincerely. To them this likely wasn\u2019t much gore (to me it isn\u2019t either*). \n\nI think you need to have an honest discussion with your friend. I recommend apologising for the impact on their party. Not because you did anything wrong - but because you did have an impact. It\u2019s like - if I got sick at a friend\u2019s party I\u2019d be sorry I interrupted things. But I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty for being sick. \n\nI\u2019d recommend more openness about your situation as well. You could give part of the information. My mother died violently - I didn\u2019t expect it to happen but when I saw you even though I knew it was pretend it felt too real - I never wanted to disrupt your party so I didn\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t tell people because I don\u2019t want people to see me as the daughter of a media headline.  An honest explanation but without having to go through everything. \n\nHow much your share would depend on how close a friend this person is and how much your trust them to respect your privacy. I\u2019m working on the assumption this person is a friend. \n\nIf your friend is a decent person they will understand. But right now - what they can see from the information available - is you ran out - and a bunch of people (not just 1 by the sound if it) focused on you instead of the birthday person.  And from what they could tell - you were ok or just a little upset (probably because you were working hard not to disrupt their party! But they doing know that) It can be hard being the new person in a group of existing friends - and it can be easy to feel that you aren\u2019t important.\n\n* through my work I very occasionally deal with crime scenes (most of which are completely mundane) - I learnt the hard way not to answer curious questions from people honestly - as stuff that to me was low level could be really confronting for others.", "NTA", "NTA!

I commend you for how you handle yourself\u2026I know from experience how hard and painful it can be dealing with the triggers that come with PTSD.

Anyone who got explained to them OP's concerns, then went ahead with this plan intending to see Miranda in the bedroom tableau is a shit person, and being a teenager doesn't excuse anything.\n\nMy guess is that fewer people than expected found Miranda's stunt entertaining, and she's trying to get people \"on her side\" about what she did.  \n\nI hope OP is doing okay, and that people (classmates, etc.) become aware of Miranda's crappy behavior.", "eh, agreeing to go to a murder party was probably not the best idea.

This whole situation could have been avoided if Miranda just told her about her plans instead of downplaying and being vague about it, OP is NTA for trusting (who she thought at the time to be) her friend.", "She knows that I have very severe reactions to blood (including fake blood) due to an incident at a Halloween party, but she doesn\u2019t know about why specifically.", "I mean \u201cit would be pretty mild\u201d from someone who knows I have an issue with blood and gore would make me think \u201cpoisoning\u201d or \u201cdrowning\u201d or maybe a gunshot wound with a small trickle of blood at the entry site.\n\nPerson with a fake knife in their chest and fake blood all over them?
