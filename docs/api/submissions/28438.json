When he proposed, the ring he used was 2 sizes too big. We went to the store, that he bought it from (2 weeks before proposing) & he kept the receipt. Gotten the right size & kept same style. We did plan to have to wedding, after 3yrs of planning & saving. 10 months after the proposal, John passed away in a car accident. I used the savings for wedding to pay for his funeral.\n\nThe day after the funeral, John\u2019s brother came to me asking for the ring. I asked why, his response was that the ring had been passed down their family for 5 generations. Told him that was BS, because I have proof of the ring was brought for me, less than a year ago. We argued for a bit & he then stormed out. Then I get the calls from john\u2019s family, saying I\u2019m a liar & demanding the ring. Then I got a letter from their lawyer, in the letter they also demanded that I reimburse them for costs of John\u2019s funeral. So I got myself a lawyer, showed the proof, about the ring & I paid for the funeral, in court & I won.\n\nI thought that madness was over, until john\u2019s sister recently messaged me. She & her BF are engaged, but haven\u2019t gotten a ring & she wants John\u2019s ring. After I said no, she went crazy & messaging non stop demanding. I have blocked her over & over, but she finds a way around it. I was having brunch with my friend, my mobile was on the table, a message from sister popped up & my friend saw it. My friend knows about everything, before sister\u2019s 1st message. I explained about her messages, friend believes I\u2019m AH & I should give her the ring. She told my other friends & they are all saying the things. Now I\u2019m doubting myself.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1696709667, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172fp5c/aita_for_not_giving_my_engagement_ring_to_dead/", "score": 7185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are being harassed by the greedy, lying, litigious family of your deceased partner. None of them deserve a damned thing from you, much less your engagement ring your fiancee bought you.\n\nHis sister can get her ring out if a gum-ball \nmachine for all you care. It is not your problem\nor responsibility to provide her with jewelery. NTA\n\nAnd you need better friends, if they are siding  with the sister. Your ring was important to you. It is yours-why would you ever lose it?", "NTA - this ring was purchased for you by your fiance, with the intent that you be the one to wear it. Although i am sympathetic that John's family is still grieving, this was intended by your fiance to be yours, not his family's heirloom.  \nSorry for your loss. I hope your friends will come around to understand why you hold onto this ring.", "I would have your lawyer send a cease and desist letter to the sister demanding that she stop harassing you. Sometimes a lawyer letter can be enough to shut people up. NTA", "NTA. It would be a little different if the ring were a family heirloom, but it clearly isn\u2019t. Perhaps you should get a restraining order, or sue for harassment?", "NTA and what kind of friends are these? I think you need to reassess. They either don\u2019t know that the ring was purchased for you as an engagement ring, a romantic gift that has nothing to do with his family, or they aren\u2019t people who care about you.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss :( I\u2019m a little confused about why your friend is siding with john\u2019s sister? You\u2019ve stated that John had purchased your engagement ring and that you had proof and a receipt from the purchase, so the ring wasn\u2019t passed down from his family whatsoever. He bought that ring specifically for you. For the family to harass and berate you about the ring that they have no ownership to is wild to me. \n\nIt is also not your fault his sister\u2019s BF didn\u2019t buy her an engagement ring. It isn\u2019t your responsibility to give her the ring your late fianc\u00e9 purchased for you??? Idk I think it\u2019s a little weird that she wants your ring and not a ring from her actual bf\u2026 especially since it doesn\u2019t have sentimental value to her.", "NTA.  I'm really sorry they are harassing you.  Block them on everything and if necessary get a restraining order if that's a thing where you live.\n\nYou suffered a horrible loss and the engagement ring is yours to remember John by.  Plus you paid for the funeral.\n\nThese people are next level audacious taking you to court and then continuing to demand the ring.", "NTA if the ring isn\u2019t a family heirloom and was bought for you I think it\u2019s more than fair that you keep it, specially as something that means so much. You already paid for his funeral and I think that was very kind of you as a fianc\u00e9 and not a wife. Get your lawyer to make them stop harassing you. I guess the only silver lining here is that you won\u2019t be entangled with these people forever", "NTA\n\nYou have a stalker.\n\nYou might want to contact the lawyer you used for that court case and ask for some advice.", "NTA, tell those wannabe thieves where to go, and tell your \u2018friends\u2019 they\u2019re welcome to pony up for her ring.\n\nThen block the lot of them. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA. They\u2019re treating it as though because the wedding didn\u2019t happen you aren\u2019t part of the family nor deserving of the ring he gave *you* and it\u2019s not fair to not ask, but demand that you give it up when it\u2019s a treasured gift he gave you before passing. They\u2019re being so low and terrible and I\u2019m sorry you going through that", "NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9's entire family and your so-called friend are the AHs.\n\nNot sure whether you can get a restraining order for this sort of thing, but seeing as it's been proved in court that they haven't got a leg to stand on it might be worth looking into it.", "No one who is an actual friend of yours would suggest you give away your engagement ring.  John's family sounds like a band of grifters.  \n\nJust keep blocking them--or you could tell them you've sold the ring and donated the money to John's favorite charity so even if you were so inclined you couldn't give them the ring. \n\nNTA \n\nThe whole part about the brother contacting you the day after John died and lying about it being a family heirloom is SUPER creepy-- and then trying to sue you for funeral expenses that you'd already paid is bizzare.", "NTA. John's family is absolutely nuts and money grubbing. John bought that ring for you because he loved you and wanted to marry you; it's a token of your love. Shame on them, their behavior is deplorable. I'm so sorry you're going through this, and I'm so sorry that his family aren't being more supportive of you and your shared loss, or at the very least leaving you the hell alone. Lawyer up, get a restraining order or something. You deserve peace and I hope you get it.", "NTA, in any way. That family is awful. They tried to make you pay for the funeral twice and now they want you to give them such a precious and personal as an engagement ring. Get a restraining order if possible.", "NTA. Jesus, these people are unhinged. To tell not just 1, but 2 so obvious and easily disproven lies is bad enough. But to take you to court to prove it? This is madness. I don't know what they are on, but you should look into getting a restraining order for the whole lot of them. I'm sorry about your fiance. I can't imagine how heartbroken you are. I hope your family and other friends are more supportive than the one who said you were in the wrong. You are not.", "NTA. \n\nReport all these deranged parasites for harassment, attempted extortion and if they lied during the court case & your lawyers can prove it for perjury too. \n\nYour friend is a jerk, if she is so keen to gift expensive engagement rings to freeloader random strangers she is welcome to message John's sister and arrange to take her ring shopping.", "NTA, I would start looking at my friends differently if they thought otherwise", "NTA. You also were not next-of-kin at the time of his death and his parents should have paid for the funeral. I think you need to block these people. They are next-level crazy.", "NTA  \nIt really seems like they think the ring is a family heirloom.", "Absolutely not - this was a gift from John to you and I presume very special to you since he passed away before you could get married. I have no idea why they remotely think they have a right to it or why your friend would side with them. Reconsider that friendship! But keep the ring. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nThat family has some nerve.

Either you're leaving something out or you move in the most irrational of circles.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nWhat that family has done and is doing is utter lunacy. That is \\*your\\* ring.", "NTA but also ditch these \"friends\" of yours", "First of all...NTA, do what feels right to YOU.\n\nSecond...get a better group of friends.", "They are not your friends.

Also consider that you deserve better friends.\n\nNTA", "NTA assuming all of this is true, which I'm going to. But what I can't figure out is WHY they all have this firm belief that the ring was a family ring. Sounds like there's existing proof it was from a store. Are they all completely insane, or is there something that complicated this information? Like, did he take the diamond from another ring and have it refitted into a storebought ring, for example? \n\nThat said, I think you need to make a choice here: Is the personal value of the ring worth more to you than the peace of never having to deal with these psychos again?

When he proposed, the ring he used was 2 sizes too big. We went to the store, that he bought it from (2 weeks before proposing) & he kept the receipt. Gotten the right size & kept same style. We did plan to have to wedding, after 3yrs of planning & saving. 10 months after the proposal, John passed away in a car accident. I used the savings for wedding to pay for his funeral.\n\nThe day after the funeral, John\u2019s brother came to me asking for the ring. I asked why, his response was that the ring had been passed down their family for 5 generations. Told him that was BS, because I have proof of the ring was brought for me, less than a year ago. We argued for a bit & he then stormed out. Then I get the calls from john\u2019s family, saying I\u2019m a liar & demanding the ring. Then I got a letter from their lawyer, in the letter they also demanded that I reimburse them for costs of John\u2019s funeral. So I got myself a lawyer, showed the proof, about the ring & I paid for the funeral, in court & I won.\n\nI thought that madness was over, until john\u2019s sister recently messaged me. She & her BF are engaged, but haven\u2019t gotten a ring & she wants John\u2019s ring. After I said no, she went crazy & messaging non stop demanding. I have blocked her over & over, but she finds a way around it. I was having brunch with my friend, my mobile was on the table, a message from sister popped up & my friend saw it. My friend knows about everything, before sister\u2019s 1st message. I explained about her messages, friend believes I\u2019m AH & I should give her the ring.

Like, my sister kept the ring and her ex-fiance kept the apartment and furniture. Rather than try and split mutual purchases, they agreed she'd keep the ring and call it a wash. It was totally allowed. Private handshake agreement was made.\n\nIf you actually get the law involved, courts don't look at why or what for. It gets messy. There is no 'he broke up with me' or arguing *why* an engagement will not end in marriage. Just did it end? Ring goes back to purchaser. \n\nThe only argument here would be if you left a will saying, 'all possessions go to fiancee if I die' and therefore, sure, the ring belongs to the estate, estate goes to the fiancee.

You made out like there was no heirloom and he just bought a completely different ring. Is it right that the original ring was an heirloom? As it\u2019s still not 100% clear.\n\nThe judge sided with you because legally even if it was an heirloom, he gave it to you and thereafter you can do what you want with it - regardless of whether you swapped it or not.
