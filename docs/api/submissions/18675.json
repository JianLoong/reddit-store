Yes I know, it's young, but I'm not here to be judged for that. On to the issue: We've recently finished designing our wedding invitations (or at least a first draft sort of thing) and mutually decided that it would be a good idea to include a couple notes on the back about conduct. Two main factors play into this, one being the abundance of horror stories about people proposing or announcing their pregnancies at weddings, and the other being that her parents are abusive narcissists who've proven themselves untrustworthy and selfish throughout our relationship.\n\nAt the bottom of the back side of the invite, we wrote something like \"Out of courtesy, please refrain from the following: Marriage proposals or pregnancy announcements, excessive white or off-white attire, and photography during the ceremony\" (we'll have a photographer and phone photography is very obnoxious in this scenario).\n\nWe both felt that these were very reasonable rules, but upon showing the invitation to my mother (60F), she found it offensive and called it alienating and \"ungodly\" (Christian household) to have these guidelines. She says if she were one of the non-family recipients, she would consider not even coming due to just that. I pointed out that not coming in that scenario would mean that she doesn't agree with the rules, meaning we wouldn't want her there anyway, but she said it's not about the rules themselves, but about putting them on the invite this way. She feels that anyone that we are worried about as far as the above issues are concerned should be spoken to privately, but I would like to avoid singling anyone out, which is why I've also leaned against having two separate versions of the invite.  \n\n\nWIBTA for including these guidelines?

The people in your life who you feel need telling this are probably the sort that would read that and then go out of their way to do it", "Those are such standard expectations at a wedding that putting them on the invitations implies that you don\u2019t believe your guests have common courtesy.  A small sign outside the ceremony venue asking people to refrain from taking photos or filming during the ceremony would be more acceptable; the other 2 really shouldn\u2019t need to be announced unless your guests are exceptionally uncouth. YWBTA if you put that on your invites.", "YWBTA, because putting something like that on your invite is akin to saying \"We think you have no social skills and are likely to ruin our wedding.\"\n\nJust don't invite anyone who you think would do something like that.  And ask your officiant to make a \"no photography please\" announcement before your ceremony, or put up a sign saying that.", "Yes, YWBTA (well, you and your intended would be).  Those are all basic etiquette rules for weddings. Anyone who reads those rules will think it was written in poor taste. The people who are the types who would break those rules WILL break them anyhow.", "Very gentle YTA - Although your thoughts are correct, I don't believe these additions are appropriate for a wedding invitation.", "YWNBTA bit I'm not sure it would have the effect you want. People who are likely to flout the social conventions you list won't pay any attention to the rules and those who would observe them may very well be in your mother's category which is that they'll be hugely offended by it.\n\nI'd be more inclined to identify those most likely to do this and try and find a sympathetic friend or family member who can get them under control or give you a heads up.", "NAH\n\nBut none of this needs to be on the invitation. It\u2019s etiquette that\u2019s mostly implied when you go to a wedding. As for the phones, you could put a sign up in the entrance to the ceremony requesting no phones during.", "You\u2019ve been on Reddit too much. Those things don\u2019t happen nearly as often irl. NTA and I don\u2019t think anyone that gets your invite would think you\u2019re an ahole, just tacky and young.", "YTA I wouldn't do any of those things but I would decline an invitation with rules attached.", "NTA but don\u2019t do it. That is tacky and off putting. And the kind of people who do those things are going to ignore it anyway so just don\u2019t invite them.", "NTA, However the people the rules are for won't care. The rest would never think of doing it. Leave it off the invite and hire security. With those types of relatives you'll probably need it anyway.", "NAH but it's tacky to put these things on the invitation. If you have concerns about specific people either don't invite them or assign someone to keep an eye on them.\n\nIt may not seem like it from reddit but the pregnancy/proposal stories don't actually happen at the vast majority of weddings.", "Oh you silly sweet summer children. Yes, you'd be the asshole, who puts rules on their invite?", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding and your invite but I\u2019ll just say that anyone who\u2019s going to do those things is not going to be deterred by it being in writing. Not making major life event announcements and not wearing white are culturally taboo and pretty much everyone already knows that so I don\u2019t think you need to state it for everyone again. Also the no photograph seems like a more on the day announcement since people will probably forget otherwise.", "YWBTA. I would skip your wedding if I saw that. You are treating your guests like children.", "Info: Do you genuinely believe any of your friends and family would do these things? If so, do you believe a list on an invitation will stop them?", "NTA\n\nthose rules are so innocuous that who cares? ungodly...lol.", "NTA-it's important to you so it's fine to communicate that clearly.", "NTA - When I got married I had shit everywhere about photography. We paid a lot for a professional photographer and I didn\u2019t care about iPhone photos, sorry.", "Maybe don\u2019t include it on the invite but on a wedding website instead? There are lots of free options and you can include a photo gallery, nearby accommodation suggestions, registry, preferred attire like casual, cocktail or formal (don\u2019t specify the white thing that\u2019s implied with weddings) and then a subtle courtesy page that is thoughtful with the wording so it\u2019s not so off-putting. This route might make it feel less abrasive and fly under moms radar since there are other personal touches on the site and it\u2019s not just a bunch of rules", "YWBTA. This is bad manners and a lack of etiquette. Also - let\u2019s be honest - the people you\u2019re worried about possibly doing any of these things would still do them. It doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re on the back of the invite, tattooed on your body or spelled out in fireworks. So it\u2019s tacky for no reason and will not make any meaningful difference.\n\nIf you have a wedding website, you can have an FAQ section or let people just ask you. When people arrive to the ceremony have ushers request they turn their phones off.\n\nCongrats & GL", "I was so ready to be judgmental due to your ages, for that, I am truly so sorry. After reading the post, I don't disagree with the very well written requests. Even though they should NOT have to be addressed. Congratulations \ud83c\udf89 & good luck to you both.", "YWBTAH It isn\u2019t necessary to list a set of rules on invitations. You are inviting people as guests to your event. The goal is to make them feel welcomed to join in the celebration of your marriage. Rules don\u2019t belong in marketing or invitations.", "I just got married and my evil MIL made the wedding about her, used flash photography when being told not to and made me cry. NTA. It might be unclassy but stop these idiots at the source. \n\nWhen is your fianc\u00e9e due?

Those all used to be \"goes without saying\" norms, but (as the abundance of wedding horror stories on this sub alone demonstrates) it's no longer universally assumed. Clearly communicating your expectations is fine. If I received an invite like that, I'd assume you had some really boorish extended family you were trying to set boundaries with, but that's about it.", "I would maybe send them as a separate slip of paper in the invite letter. Have the official invite, then have your restrictions. You are NTA, but I think this will come across better", "NTA but I agree with your mother that it could be done with a bit more tact.  Maybe omit from the invite itself and send out a separate letter with the request on it?", "NAH - what you have included is simply common courtesy however I am constantly seeing that common courtesy  (like common sense) is not that common any more\u2026. So you have to tailor the invites to your audience, if you suspect someone is going to propose, or wear white, this would be one way to address that\u2026", "NTA\n\nBut you can come up with a much better way of putting it. Something that doesn\u2019t make it sound like a list of classroom expectations.\n\nYou could make it funny, find a youtube video of wedding drama because someone proposed and say you aren\u2019t looking to increase your followers by getting married so you request that your guests not reenact it.\n\nLeave the photography stuff off the invite and address it at the wedding. Ditto if you don\u2019t want guests posting to socials until you\u2019ve had a chance to.", "YTA. 99% of your guests know this already. The rest won't care.Her parents will go out of there way to break that.  You have to manage them directly and carefully.  You can remind people to not take photos as it interferes with the photographer at the ceremony.", "You say you don't want to be judged for getting married so young, then come here and want to do something incredibly immature. Clearly, you're not mature enough to get married if your asking something so obvious. Yes, YWBTA if you print \"rules\" on your wedding invites.", "Young marriages have an extremely slim chance of lasting (especially coming from a family situation like you describe), so playing the odds, you'll get to do it over again in a few years.\n\nJust dont have kids till 28 and you have no problems.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
