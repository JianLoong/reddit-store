Yes I know, it's young, but I'm not here to be judged for that. On to the issue: We've recently finished designing our wedding invitations (or at least a first draft sort of thing) and mutually decided that it would be a good idea to include a couple notes on the back about conduct. Two main factors play into this, one being the abundance of horror stories about people proposing or announcing their pregnancies at weddings, and the other being that her parents are abusive narcissists who've proven themselves untrustworthy and selfish throughout our relationship.\n\nAt the bottom of the back side of the invite, we wrote something like \"Out of courtesy, please refrain from the following: Marriage proposals or pregnancy announcements, excessive white or off-white attire, and photography during the ceremony\" (we'll have a photographer and phone photography is very obnoxious in this scenario).\n\nWe both felt that these were very reasonable rules, but upon showing the invitation to my mother (60F), she found it offensive and called it alienating and \"ungodly\" (Christian household) to have these guidelines. She says if she were one of the non-family recipients, she would consider not even coming due to just that. I pointed out that not coming in that scenario would mean that she doesn't agree with the rules, meaning we wouldn't want her there anyway, but she said it's not about the rules themselves, but about putting them on the invite this way. She feels that anyone that we are worried about as far as the above issues are concerned should be spoken to privately, but I would like to avoid singling anyone out, which is why I've also leaned against having two separate versions of the invite.  \n\n\nWIBTA for including these guidelines?
