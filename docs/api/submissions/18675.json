Yes I know, it's young, but I'm not here to be judged for that. On to the issue: We've recently finished designing our wedding invitations (or at least a first draft sort of thing) and mutually decided that it would be a good idea to include a couple notes on the back about conduct. Two main factors play into this, one being the abundance of horror stories about people proposing or announcing their pregnancies at weddings, and the other being that her parents are abusive narcissists who've proven themselves untrustworthy and selfish throughout our relationship.\n\nAt the bottom of the back side of the invite, we wrote something like \"Out of courtesy, please refrain from the following: Marriage proposals or pregnancy announcements, excessive white or off-white attire, and photography during the ceremony\" (we'll have a photographer and phone photography is very obnoxious in this scenario).\n\nWe both felt that these were very reasonable rules, but upon showing the invitation to my mother (60F), she found it offensive and called it alienating and \"ungodly\" (Christian household) to have these guidelines. She says if she were one of the non-family recipients, she would consider not even coming due to just that. I pointed out that not coming in that scenario would mean that she doesn't agree with the rules, meaning we wouldn't want her there anyway, but she said it's not about the rules themselves, but about putting them on the invite this way. She feels that anyone that we are worried about as far as the above issues are concerned should be spoken to privately, but I would like to avoid singling anyone out, which is why I've also leaned against having two separate versions of the invite.  \n\n\nWIBTA for including these guidelines?

Also, designate a master of ceremonies who understands the situation so that they will not hand over the mic to anyone who isn't authorised and so that they also understand to distract people from and shut down any situation that may arise. Finally, if you're having a DJ or band, inform them that under no circumstances are they to take requests (or just requests from specific people. Provide names and photos if needed), but to keep the peace, have them take the request to the person's face but not actually play the song etc. If requester keeps approaching the DJ/band this will give your interference guys the opportunity to kick them out.

Nothing happened yet so this kind of messages sound a bit arrogant.\n\nThe thing you should actually do for preventing any shenanigans at your wedding is being ready to catch and expell promptly anyone who tries them, something that is seldom done in the stories of this sub.

The older generation are very sensitive though so they might think it\u2019s a personal attack but luckily that will keep in the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds for the wedding.

Give them an Extra Special role that they can\u2019t sabotage and that you don\u2019t actually care if it happens or not. An example, someone wanted to manage their egotistical aunt who they still wanted there. My mum gave her the role of holding flowers, that someone else brought, and presenting them one at a time to the bridal party before they went up the aisle. This meant that she had to be \u201cin place\u201d for a while before the ceremony started, and that everyone\u2019s attention was on her foot a good minute or two right at the start of the ceremony. But if it hadn\u2019t happened it wouldn\u2019t have mattered to the couple (unlike, say, if she had the rings), and the actual ceremony focused on them.\n\n2. A close group of trusted accomplices. Clue in a few of your most socially complement friends of family members. Show them pictures of the parents, and any other Risky Guests. Then tell them \u201cIf you see Mother doing \u2026 (eg. Walking towards the stage) intervene\u201d. Intervene by heading over and saying something like \u201cAre you Sarah\u2019s mum? I\u2019ve heard you make the most amazing lasagne/ are great at crochet/ are a crack shot! Can you tell me more about it?\u201d The accomplice can then listen to them monologue for as long as necessary, before saying they need to use the bathroom and escaping.\n\nBonus one from me: a good seating plan is magic. Keep the right people out of each other\u2019s eye-line.", "NTA\n\nIt seems similar to when people say that their weddings are kid-free on their invitations.

Apparently, I live on another universe because I have never ever heard of rules at a wedding besides the general unspoken rules of being someone else's guest. Hell, at my wedding, my friend announced it was his birthday, and the after wedding / birthday party was 8 miles south. I changed out of my gown and happily partied with my friends when we were done at my venue. Weddings are for fun times with people we love while making a promise to the one we will love forever, personally I don't see how someone's announcement or proposal could be a bad thing, yes it's your day but there's a whole ass planet of humans who have stuff going on too including your family and friends. I'd be honored if someone chose my day to say they found their person or are bringing new life into the world.
