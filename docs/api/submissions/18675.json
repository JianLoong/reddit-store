Yes I know, it's young, but I'm not here to be judged for that. On to the issue: We've recently finished designing our wedding invitations (or at least a first draft sort of thing) and mutually decided that it would be a good idea to include a couple notes on the back about conduct. Two main factors play into this, one being the abundance of horror stories about people proposing or announcing their pregnancies at weddings, and the other being that her parents are abusive narcissists who've proven themselves untrustworthy and selfish throughout our relationship.\n\nAt the bottom of the back side of the invite, we wrote something like \"Out of courtesy, please refrain from the following: Marriage proposals or pregnancy announcements, excessive white or off-white attire, and photography during the ceremony\" (we'll have a photographer and phone photography is very obnoxious in this scenario).\n\nWe both felt that these were very reasonable rules, but upon showing the invitation to my mother (60F), she found it offensive and called it alienating and \"ungodly\" (Christian household) to have these guidelines. She says if she were one of the non-family recipients, she would consider not even coming due to just that. I pointed out that not coming in that scenario would mean that she doesn't agree with the rules, meaning we wouldn't want her there anyway, but she said it's not about the rules themselves, but about putting them on the invite this way. She feels that anyone that we are worried about as far as the above issues are concerned should be spoken to privately, but I would like to avoid singling anyone out, which is why I've also leaned against having two separate versions of the invite.  \n\n\nWIBTA for including these guidelines?

This meant that she had to be \u201cin place\u201d for a while before the ceremony started, and that everyone\u2019s attention was on her foot a good minute or two right at the start of the ceremony.

Sometimes couples have the officiant offer up one big moment for everyone to snap a pic of the couple at the altar, and then that's it. Also you can *politely* phrase this in the program if you have one (the program for guests who are there, not the invitation!) You can have your ushers say something too as they seat guests. \n\n2) I'm sure you have certain people in mind who might wear white or hijack the day with their own big personal milestone. Have family or friends be on the lookout and do some recon to make sure these live wires come dressed appropriately and know their place.\n\nIf people do end up breaking these rules, let them be the embarrassed ones and enjoy your day, knowing they don't matter. Don't embarrass yourself on your own wedding invitation.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS!\n\nWBTA.", "NAH.  This is something that is learned through experience.  The invite should include a dress code, though.  You can pick from any range of dress from beach to white tie.\n\nWhat you could do is send an addendum that lays it all out.  Some people will still argue with you that \"cream/ivory\" is not \"white\" so I can wear it!  So, you will need to define \"excessive\" and what counts as white.\n\nThe refraining from photography I've seen on wedding invitations before so that one isn't unusual.", "Yeah don\u2019t do this, it\u2019s tacky and inappropriate and honestly kind of immature which will just feed into the narrative that you are way too young to be getting married. \n\nPeople understand wedding etiquette, you don\u2019t need to be contrarian about it. A note in the ceremony booklet (not the invite) about photography is fine as this is less etiquette and more personal preference. \nYWBTA", "NTA, but honestly....everything listed there is already considered common courtesy(except the no photos thing. That's just rude but it's your party). The kind of people who you are trying to deter from doing these things are NOT going to be stopped from a little note on the invitation. It's just going to peeve them off, which has been clearly demonstrated.", "VERY gently, YWBTA (YTA). Most of those rules should be a given, and as others have said, those who would do these things probably wouldn\u2019t listen anyway.\n\nBut I do agree with the photography thing. I don\u2019t mind phones myself but I\u2019ve noticed that all the official photos at recent weddings have just had everyone holding up phones in the background (like for the first dance etc). It\u2019s much nicer to see everyone just enjoying the moment. Also, some people will post awful snaps of the couple straight away on socials and I think it\u2019s nice for the couple to show off their favourite pictures first. So for this I\u2019d suggest maybe just including a note saying something like this\u2026 \n\n\u2018We respectfully request that guests refrain from taking lots of phone pictures. We\u2019ve got an official photographer who will be doing this for us so that you can relax and simply enjoy the celebrations\u2019\n\nOr pop a little sign up somewhere that they can see on their arrival.\n\nEither way, enjoy your big day.

I pointed out that not coming in that scenario would mean that she doesn't agree with the rules, meaning we wouldn't want her there anyway, but she said it's not about the rules themselves, but about putting them on the invite this way.  \n\nSomeone not coming doesn't just mean that they disagree with those rules, it also means that they may not want to go to what sounds like a dumpster fire of a wedding if those things are needing to be said as blanket statements. And that's the perception its creating, because its being identified as such a big problem that it needs to specifically be said.\n\n(with the exception of the photography one, I do think that one is reasonable as a heads-up because that one varies, but the other two are sufficiently standard that them being on the invite has an implication of its going to be a wedding full of conflict and many people won't be interested in going to that)", "First of congratulations on the wedding,you are not the a-hole being that it\u2019s you and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding all guests should listen to the invite.it\u2019s you wedding and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about putting those rules there (the rules/notes are definitely reasonable since it\u2019s your day) if your mother doesn\u2019t agree with them, then that\u2019s on her, but you shouldn\u2019t feel like you have to change it.", "OP you haven't covered all the bases. Engagement announcements, college graduation, births, new job, buying a house...", "YES YWBTA because why are you inviting people who do shit like that to your own wedding anyway? Because of the attention you need or for another gift you need?? If you can't decide who to invite to one of the most important days of your life then you're too young to get married. Every adult knows that those are basic rules of a wedding. The only reason you both don't know that is because yall are teenagers. So if you're putting them on the invites for your teen friends it would make more sense but literally every adult knows those rules already.", "Absolutely unnecessary & even if people broke those rules it makes them look dumb and rude.\n.", "The one about the photographer is useful, it's sad that you feel the need to outline the other stuff because it should be basic manners everyone knows.", "I think there are better ways of doing this.\n\n'No photography during the ceremony' is a reasonable request, but don't put it on the invite, just have the officiant announce it at the start of the ceremony.\n\n'no excessive white or off-white atire' could become 'Dress code: formal, any colour (except white!)'. Then that way it's just a funny little aside, rather than making a big deal of it.\n\nNo pregnancy announcements/marriage proposals frankly there is no good way to say without sounding insulting that anyone would need to be told that. If there's anyone in your family who you think is likely to pull that kind of bullshit, speak to them about it separately.\n\nI would also say stop listening to reddit for your idea of a typical wedding lmao, most weddings do not include guests wearing white or surprise announcements.", "I have seen people specify no photography during the ceremony at a few I\u2019ve been to.

Like I wouldn\u2019t mind, and would specify that I encourage guests capturing moments but also to remember to enjoy the moment with us.

The last wedding I did had a no photography and no social posts without permission rule. It was a lovely day. I hate folks taking pictures during the ceremony. Guess what. It's always the older generation that does the intrusive photography. Anyone under 30 doesn't need to be told.\n\nAnd as a Minister, I'll be the judge of what's ungodly.", "YTA your mum is correct.

But you can convey that information in other ways, with a little wit. Like, make a web site of horrible wedding stories, and include each of your concerns in one of them. The \"white dress\" can be a confession: she didn't know the rule and was super embarrassed. The \"proposal\" one can be told by the recipient of the proposal, who learned that her bf was a rude cad when he proposed at a wedding, and then had to pretend to be happy to avoid a fight until she ditched him in the parking lot after the reception.

I\u2019m very private and didn\u2019t even post online that I was getting married. It felt like a violation. We had it at a beautiful mansion, with lots of good food and open bar. I was also very selective about the guest lists. Folks who have a tendency to get overly drunk and belligerent were not invited. I also witnessed family members attend a wedding with jeans, $400 sneakers and t-shirts and just a total lack of respect for the bride and groom.

That way no one can say no one told us it was taboo.", "There are some people out there that have never really been to a wedding and are just confused about what is and isn't appropriate.  Others are assholes and need to have the threat of public embarrassment hanging over their heads to get them to not break the rules.\n\nMy dad had to send out an addendum to the wedding invitation for my sister despite the dress code being listed as \"black-tie optional\".  We still had people saying they were going to come in jeans and t-shirts (no this wasn't a matter of not being able to afford a suit or rent a tux, they just didn't want to wear the suit they already owned).  He laid out all the acceptable options and told them they'd be thrown out of the venue if they showed up in jeans anyway. \n\nWe had others who were genuinely confused because they'd never been to a formal event like this (mainly my grandparents' generation) and were considering not attending because it sounded \"too fancy\".  My dad told them that their \"Sunday Best\" was more than appropriate.\n\nI've seen the photo ban on invites.  That is actually normal.", "I agree with this. OPs intent isn't bad, but some people out there think that the rules don't apply to them and will ignore it anyway. Most decent folk wouldn't even consider doing any of that at a wedding.

Someone wore white on my wedding and the next wedding was announced (by my aunt). At my daughter's wedding someone proposed.

That will really help a lot.", "Oh that's a good idea: make a proposal about wedding colours. My daughter did this.

She really did not know. At my daughter's wedding her BIL proposed because he really thought it would be okay if he did it after midnight and he got permission from the groom (though my daughter, the bride, was angry, for she wasn't asked).
