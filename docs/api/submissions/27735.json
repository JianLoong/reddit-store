She hated the whole process of getting weighed, people seeing the number, and hearing from her doctor she was too heavy.\n\nSince the appointment, I've tried to slowly implement healthy changes, like asking her to cook with me, offering to go on walks, looking for other activities she might have interest in.\n\nMy wife has discouraged this, simply telling me Dana isn't interested and I should drop it. I asked her what her solution was. Her solution is to just wait until Dana decides she's ready to change. My case was that, the weight loss struggle is hard enough, and it will be much harder if her epiphany doesnt come for another 50-100 pounds. I told my wife that her plan was not a plan of success, and unrealistic. She argued that my plan will only cause rebellion.\n\nTo my wife, asking Dana on walks is pointless, as is seeing if she wants to cook because she doesn't like exercise or most healthy food. Her idea is to keep things as they are: Let Dana have as many unhealthy snacks as she wants, go buy her bigger and bigger pants and shirts as she outgrows what she has( an issue we've faced a lot over the past few years especially).\n\nMy wife tells me it was very upsetting when i told her her ideas were unrealistic\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695831607, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tox0c/aita_for_telling_my_wife_shes_unrealistic_in_her/", "score": 2039, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Forcing her is a recipe for disaster in the long run, but asking her to do things with you is a positive way to help her.", "Losing the weight seems like a secondary  problem.  Why the overeating or only eating unhealthy foods?  Does she have friends?  Good at school?  A bf/gf?  Interests or hobbies? Is she sad or depressed?  Does she binge eat?  Late night eater?  Maybe therapy before a diet?  NTA but Mom needs to step up and stop burying her head in the sand.", "INFO: Have you guys tried getting help from an expert from her pediatrician like a ~~nutritionist~~ dietitian? What about talking to your daughter? Like is there a root cause (i.e. depression?)? And what led to this point in terms of your parenting?", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re doing what a parent is supposed to do: guide and warn. Good on you and ignore the naysayers here. If your daughter starts to give significant pushback, then ease off.", "NTA\n\nReading your comments, though, it sounds like there is a deeper issue here with your daughter. I would seek counseling for her. At the very least, a nutritionist. \n\nEating disorders go both ways. The fact that your daughter \"doesn't like healthy foods\" tells me that she might be a junk food addict and your wife is enabling that. The fact that your daughter is unfazed by with her doctor's concern is another warning. \n\nA lot of teens deal with self esteem issues that can manifest into unhealthy habits. Getting her some consistent professional help might go a long way.", "NTA, but I\u2019m majorly side-eyeing your wife. You have less than one year to help Dana make healthy changes before she\u2019s legally an adult and can dig her own grave with a knife and a fork despite any of your efforts. Can you tell us more about the dynamic between your wife and daughter? This might just be one example but it\u2019s really worrying.", "NTA but honestly speaking as a fat kid who became a fit teenager then an adult who fluctuates from fit to fat, she wont change until she wants to. I dont diet until I feel I really want to, then I go all in. But if someone tried to push me to do it prior I'd be mad at them even if the intentions were good. It would make me feel like something was bad about me and they want to change it because I'm bad somehow.\n\nIt comes down to *her*. Maybe you can tell her you love her and if she ever wants you will be there to help her with healthier methods. Let her take the step towards it vs trying to force it on her. If you are asking maybe dont ask all the time just occasionally. You said in other comments that she treats it like a joke, there is no real way to make her change her view, she has to do it herself. I think eventually, she will.\n\nI also really hated being weighed, having the number called out, etc. It made me not go for physicals until my 30s because I hated being told I was fat all the time. By then I had high cholesterol and such. It's weirdly traumatic for people even if it is with good intent to make the person want to be healthier.\n\nAlso wanted to edit because this thought came to me too: your daughter knows she is obese. Even if she brushes it off, it probably bothers her on some level. I knew I was a fat kid. People point it out even if the doctor didnt. It's not an easy thing to deal with and she eventually will either want to change or it will just be how she is and you have to accept it.", "NTA. Asking your daughter to spend time with you is a good thing. If it\u2019s executed by doing something healthy, even better.  Pushing it is not a good thing. Your wife is not completely wrong but she\u2019s also not addressing the issue at all.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s your job as a parent to keep your daughter healthy. It\u2019s also your wife\u2019s job yet, she sounds enabling and lazy about it. You\u2019re approaching it perfectly.\n\nDo you realize that there is an epidemic of young obese people and for the first time in history this generation is not expected to live as long as their parents? Heart disease, diabetes etc are striking these kids at an alarming early age. \n\nGetting your daughter active, removing processed foods and teaching her healthy food habits like knowing how to cook and what to cook is extremely important. You only have a year, wishing you all the best!", "NTA\nYou\u2019re literally just trying to help Dana", "ESH - Why have you both as parents waited so long to get Dana accustomed to healthier food options? To being more active. It sounds like your wife is still wanting to let your child run the show. While your approach is better - either way you have  an uphill battle to come", "INFO\n\nHow is Dana responding to your invitations and suggestions? What does she want to do?", "INFO\n\nWhat does your daughter say or feel about the situation. \n\nI agree that you could both help by changing your family diet to be healthier and to be more active, but you don't need to give her a complex about her weight.", "How about you and wife confer with a nutrionist or obesity doctor and see if there are actions you can take that are more productive and see what advice they give?   I think your heart is in the right place, but the fault lies in the execution in these situations.  You could be setting her up to believe she is less loveable as an obese person and/or trigger ed behaviors.\n\nShe has to want this.  She will not do it for you and you need to let go of that control.", " NTA. But as someone who was an obese teenager those suggestions won\u2019t work. If we aren\u2019t ready to change we won\u2019t. We double down. Plus has your daughter suffered any trauma that might using food to make herself feel better? I did and I wish someone had asked me.", "NTA - you  sound like a loving dad.\n\nQuestion, is your wife also overweight?  In the meantime try to keep engaging your daughter and phrase walk as opportunities to talk, cooking as times to interact and get her ready to be more independent.\n\nGood luck OP, your wife sounds like she is trying to keep your daughter overweight and stuck at home.", "NTA. But be careful and consider therapy as well, pressure of any kind can lead to eating disorders or worse", "Definitely NTA....the way you're going about it is encouraging and engaging. It sounds like you're wife is waiting until your daughter gets to the point of not being able to walk or leave the house at all.  \nThis is a recipe for disaster.", "ESH - at this point you need to ask Dana what she wants. The stuff you are doing could help but could just as easily make things works. Dana needs to drive her own bus.", "You're both right, NAH. Dana won't change until she wants  to, but educating her and encouraging her to accompany you on reasonable healthy habits is a good approach. \n\nI'm very overweight, too. My health education in high school was not very useful 20+ years ago, and the \"healthy\" choices I made ( orange juice instead of soda after football practice, for instance)  were self sabotage without me knowing. \n\nHabits formed at her age are hard to break.", "NTA, but with her almost being an adult, it will be difficult to guide her towards change if she doesn\u2019t want to. Losing weight is a process that becomes a lifestyle for a while and you have to actively choose that lifestyle every day until you get to your target weight. Most importantly is to balance losing weight with a good relationship with food and self esteem. \n\nI think you\u2019re definitely doing the right things but since she\u2019s not receptive, there\u2019s not much more you can do. I also share the sentiment of not waiting until she gains more weight that could harm her and need more intense intervention, but it needs to come from her and not having your wife\u2019s support, it\u2019s even harder\u2026 i hope she wants this change soon", "Nta. Assuming you are being kind about it, healthier meals and offering some light exercise seem like the the perfect approach", "Given your description of how your daughter hated the process of being weighed at the doctor\u2019s office, have you considered therapy? Your daughter could be on the way to an eating disorder if that process was that distressing to her. Sure, encourage a healthy relationship with food and light exercise, but don\u2019t leave out the mental health component. NTA, as long as it\u2019s asking not forcing, but also look at mental health services.", "Nta but your wife has a very solid point. If your daughter doesn't want to change the only thing your doing is turning your self into the bad guy", "Neither you nor your wife is an AH. But I don't think you should discuss Dana's weight at all. She is 17. She has a mirror. Do you think she doesn't know that she has gained weight and her pants don't fit? Telling a teenager to eat less and exercise more has helped exactly 0% of teens with weight loss. At the same time, I agree that doing nothing is also not a great option. Make your household as healthy as possible. Do not keep tempting foods at home. Don't make as much pasta or potatoes as you would normally make for dinner so that larger portion sizes aren't even an option. Make more of the protein and veggies so it's not obvious what you are going. It is next to impossible for adults to avoid eating junk when we keep it around - we should not expect more from our children than we do from ourselves. Walking is good for both physical and emotional health. I would just try to reframe the activities as less about losing weight and more about mental well being. You could even say that you need to walk for yourself and tell her you'd really like company. Ultimately, your wife is correct and you do not have control over her weight.", "ESH... your daughter is practically an adult. WHAT manner of help does she want?\n\nGive her options. Gym membership. Counciling.  Nutritionist. Dance class. Bicycle. Treadmill. Subscription to noom.....\n\nWhatever she is interested in. If she is not ready, then dont push, offer to be there when she is ready and then stop talking BUT lead by silent example. \n\nPushing WILL make it worse.", "NTA. Ask your wife if there is any weight at which action should be taken. If not now, *when*? \n\nIn my experience, weight loss takes a looooong time for most people because drastic change is usually unrealistic. It's a lifestyle, not a task. (I really dislike \"lifestyle\" in any other context, but it does fit here.) It's a couple small things that lead to a couple more that then have some success, which then leads to some more efforts. It's a cycle that becomes self-reinforcing. \n\nYou don't need to be an absolutist and count every calorie and balance every nutrient. If that works for you, great! But that doesn't work for most. Trying to be a bit more active this week/month/year than last will get you there eventually. \n\nIf at all possible, try to find something active that she enjoys. I hate watching what I eat, but that same process will happen almost painlessly when it arises out of being active. It takes a while to get to that step, so you can't focus on it. Just focus on having a good time being active and things will (should) tend to fall into place. \n\nI say this as someone whose weight has bounced from 145 in HS to over 200 in college, back down to 165 for the rest of my 20s and then over 220 for a long time. I'm back to 170-ish and re-learning just how different life is when you're not overweight. It is well worth the tradeoffs. \n\nFact is, excess weight is bad for pretty much everything. It'll shorten lifespan and make things in life harder. *It's not a personal attack to say factually that not being overweight makes life easier and longer.* She can look forward to knee issues and not wanting to go out because seats on planes and at events are too narrow, and people move too fast/long for her to really keep up. That'll self-reinforce watching tv/internet and smacking, which makes weight increase, etc. Or she can choose to bend the change in the other direction. \n\nWhich life does she want? Heavier, more homebound, shorter life or lighter, more active, longer life? It's a choice to pursue one or the other.", "NAH\n\nYou're both right.  Your daughter will only change if and when she wants.  On the other hand, you should continue offering exercise/cooking tips and setting a good example.  Don't try to force her or lecture her.", "NTA. Just don't force things on her or she might end up resenting you and the healthy choices. \n\nI think your best bet is trying to find something active that she likes to do. If she isn't looking to change, then exercise for the sake of exercise won't be sustainable. \n\nI'd stop having super unhealthy snacks, and be willing to help fund some active hobbies.", "Nta. Take her to an endocrinologist, make sure she doesn't have any thyroid issues. If not, they would have a weight management clinic.", "NAH. It\u2019s such a difficult line to walk. The fact is the weight will continue to rise, especially if she is planning to go off to college soon. (The freshman fifteen is a real thing and can easily surpass 15 lbs.) I think you are right to encourage physical activity that she enjoys, even if it is not a traditional \u201cwork out\u201d. Maybe she likes dance or VR gaming?\n\nDaily dad and daughter walks and cooking together can create time for dad and daughter to regularly talk and develop an even closer relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that you both love your daughter and want to encourage her without alienating her. If you approach it as such, with love and encouragement vs. criticism and nagging, I think you have a shot of being successful. Wishing you much luck.", "At seventeen years old, those poor habits are going to be super hard to break. She\u2019s not a child who doesn\u2019t know any better and can\u2019t stop herself from eating an entire pack of Oreos. You really should have implemented better habits and a more healthy relationship with food at a younger age. I don\u2019t think a kid just springs up to that size over night. Why wasn\u2019t something done earlier?", "ESH she\u2019s 17\u2026 how long have both of you been neglecting her care\u2026 I encourage you to keep trying to teach her healthier lifestyle tips but these are things that needed taught from an early age and it\u2019s sooo much more difficult for her now than it would have been a few years ago.", "Dana is 17. She is practically an adult. You need to stay out of it. Mandate that she see a dietician and a therapist as part of your continued financial support, and then COMPLETELY STAY OUT OF IT. \n\nParents obsessing over their daughter\u2019s body never never ends okay. I\u2019m sorry, but you failed her long long ago, and it\u2019s too late now, so shut up. \n\nShe needs the space to take ownership of her body and her choices and work directly with medical professionals. She deserves privacy and dignity as she does this. You just need to step back and love her and support her. \n\nHer worth as a person is not defined by her weight, and her health is out of your hands at 17.\n\nI know what I\u2019m talking about. I am recovered from a 15 year eating disorder and healthy. As a parent you can only make it worse at this point. \n\nHOWEVER, you absolutely need to find a way to support her medical care financially, because this is on you. \n\nESH.", "NTA, OP, a little late but you have the right approach. Do try to see if anything can be done for her psyche!", "NTA. Letting your daughter eat her way into a gastric bypass isn't an option but as she is unwilling to own she has a problem I think getting the help of a nutritionist is your best way forward.", "If your plan does not start with an endocrinologist and psychiatrist you are doing a disservice to your daughter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nESH, you're both doing what you want, not whats best.", "Have you had her tested for Polycyatic Ovary Syndrome aka PCOS?", "NTA - Your daughter's life is at stake.  Your approach isn't enough, but your wife's approach is insane and will do nothing.  I bet your daughter has depression as well, and exercise and better food will help with that too.", "I\u2019m going to with NAH. But if you push her, you WB T-A\n\nSo I\u2019m a larger woman. I have endocrine issues plus autoimmune dysfunction, and my weight is a side effect. It\u2019s no fun to go into a doctors office and have your body treated as a disease. As the problem. Like dude I have fluid in my ear, what I ate for dinner or my activity isn\u2019t changing that (lol).\n\nDana needs to find activity she likes. Forcing her to do something is a recipe for disaster, but maybe she\u2019d like to do something light like yoga or tai chi. If as some are suggesting a mental health issue, these activities can help her with that. \n\nHas Dana ever learned how to cook? I find when kids are given the reigns to have control over their cooking and take pride in it, it encourages health promoting behaviors. Which at the end of the day, is what Dana needs to do\n\nFocus less on the weight part, more on the behaviors", "YTA. Did you and your wife not spend the time when she was younger to find a sport she enjoyed?  Did you not instill healthy eating habits at a young age?  This did not happen in a vacuum.  Did you have no input in how she was raised?", "I\u2019ll say I was your daughter in this, and it really grossed me out and upset me how much my dad tied my worthiness to my weight, you should consider your setting her up for weird body issues with her attractiveness to men to have this pressure coming from you. I knew my parents were not overweight people, and they preferred if I wasn\u2019t. I already knew that, my mom never complimented my looks or anything but she also didn\u2019t apply pressure to me, she just talked about what she does to stay in shape. I\u2019m not dumb, I observed that. She walks, cooks healthy, doesn\u2019t eat out too much but never policed me when we did, and that\u2019s really it. My dad would make little disapproving looks and tell me it\u2019s a problem. Long story short, I don\u2019t give a shit when my dad has something to tell me anymore because I find his opinions gross and shallow and this is one reason why. At 18, at college, I used the gym and counted calories and never got bigger than about your daughters range and I did decide to do it on my own because the resources were easily available and I did it for myself. I know you worry about being lackadaisical about it leading to higher weight gain but you need to show, not tell. And at some point, it\u2019s possible to just let her be her own person, she\u2019s almost an adult now and adults are allowed to fuck up, do t tie your approval of her to that though, please. It\u2019s beyond health with women, that their size is judged, and you know that. Don\u2019t make her feel weird, as her dad, plenty of other people will do that for her. Worthiness feeling is important and if you put too much pressure on her all she\u2019ll know is her own dad doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s worthy, and it\u2019s gross to know/feel like that comes from looks. Consider this perspective.", "NTA - this is tough, both of you love your daughter and are doing what you feel is best for her, but it\u2019s important to get the healthy habits started now so she doesn\u2019t have to struggle with learning them on her own later.", "NTA - as long as you\u2019re kind about it, offering solutions when she knows it\u2019s a problem is the best course. Maybe see what she thinks would be most helpful for her? If you can afford to, maybe she could do some PT sessions at a local gym, or get an online fitness coach who can advise on nutrition / workouts (even ones at home).

However, what is very important is to set an good example, and not enable her either. Cook healthy meals, invite her for walks, etc.", "NTA. She's 17 - there's still time to instill healthy habits and help her with her health.

Even though you are probably right. NTA but doesn\u2019t make your wife the AH. Ask your daughter if she wants to but don\u2019t push her coz no one likes to be told what to do. You could go on walks anyway, so it\u2019s not all focused on your daughter, and eventually she might come.", "NTA your wife is setting your daughter up for an early grave. Healthy habits need to be formed NOW before she has a heart attack at 25 years old. Happened to my step-son's older sister, she almost passed. Luckily she took the scare seriously and has taken major strides to live a healthier life since it happened in early 2020.", "Find an activity she likes and make it a family affair. Also, you and wife need to be on the same page\u2014if both of you are inactive, your daughter will think activity isn\u2019t a priority and will feel singled out. Walking is lowkey boring, maybe try a sport? Maybe she\u2019d enjoy the gym/weight lifting? I prefer the elliptical/bike and to lift weights rather than walk. See if she\u2019d be interested in going to the gym, or get some at home equipment y\u2019all can try together? She\u2019s also 17, so might be something going on (mental health, or just teenage apathy, lol). NTA, but I can understand your wife treading lightly because there\u2019s so much pressure on women and their bodies. Your daughter isn\u2019t tiny, she\u2019s tall for a girl, so her frame may just be bigger. She may also just drop the weight in a few years. HOWEVER, it is smart to encourage movement (to feel good and for mental health, not solely for weight management) and good food choices, but the entire family needs to be on board and you guys as parents have to be united especially in front of her.", "NTA i think this is very sweet of you. As a heavier person I would have loved a psrent who made these suggestions in a non judgmental way.

The earlier the better, hope you can convince your wife and you will find the right way for your daughter to choose a healthy life.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nI think your wife is in denial. \n\nWeight issues are a combination of genetics (some people have a harder time with weight than others) and diet/exercise, and sometimes hormonal issues. In your daughter's case, you state she eats and unhealthy diet and does not exercise, so that would be one place to start. \n\nI think asking her to come on walks every evening with you is a good plan. I would suit up in walking clothes every day. I would invite her out. Make it fun. Coax her to come. If she doesn't go, you go anyway! Lead by example! And don't give up. Sometimes it takes time for better habits to set up. \n\nYour wife's dumb insistence of having crap food all over the house is bad for everyone. Clean out the pantry. Throw away the cookies and chips. Pour the sugary soda down the drain. If your wife buys it again, pour it down the drain again. Keep healthy food in the house. Save unhealthy food for occasional treats, not for regular grazing. Stock up the fridge with good healthy snack food like hummus, carrot sticks, yogurt, apples. Figure out what healthy foods your daughter likes to eat. Most of the time when I make poor food choices? It's because nothing delicious and healthy was readily available and I had to settle for something quick and easy. So make healthy and delicious things readily available to your daughter--as snack foods and at meals so she is not tempted to eat fast food or fill up on junk snack food. If you don't cook dinner and your wife is responsible for putting unhealthy meals on the table, then you start cooking healthy meals several times a week.", "I think you're a very caring father who wants to help his daughter, me, I would have done it sooner.
