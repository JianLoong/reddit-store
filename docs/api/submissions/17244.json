Since we were little when she\u2019d borrow my things and destroyed them or never returned them. For example she\u2019d leave her food inside my bags then it would rot and couldn\u2019t be washed and because of her we\u2019ve thrown away more than 5 bags. Also she\u2019d take my things and trade them with her friends without asking me or loosing them. My parents would justify her because she was little and didn\u2019t know any better, but now she\u2019s 16 and still unable to take her of things. Last year her school bag got dirty, so she borrowed mine and literally burned it the next day when it was in a perfect condition and was worth around 50\u20ac. She had also borrowed my pencil case worth 30\u20ac that I bought with my savings and drew all over it with indelible marker and obviously it couldn\u2019t be washed. Luckily it was still in stock and I made her replace it with her own money. Every time she\u2019d take my clothes they were returned with holes or with unwashable stains. I got tired of her shit and not respecting others things so I decided to charge her for every little thing she takes. For example if she wants to borrow my T-shirt she\u2019d pay 2\u20ac and if she destroys it in any way (except for washable stains) she\u2019d give me 10\u20ac. My sister complained to our parents because I refuse to share my things but in reality I want to teach her a lesson for respecting others trust and keeping the things she borrows in a good quality.

Sounds like you\u2019re teaching her to be more respectful of others belongings by adding by making her post a deposit. Unfortunately your parents should have been the ones to do this.", "How about instead of charging her, make her put down a security deposit? She gives you the full value of the item she's borrowing when she borrows it. If she returns it in the same condition, she gets it all back, and if the item is damaged in any way, you keep enough of the deposit to repair or replace the item borrowed.", "NTA, but your parents (or lack of parenting) sure are", "NTA - and your parents aren't worried about this behavior at 16? They should be the ones teaching that to your sister. They're the ah of the story.", "NTA. This is actually a great solution", "NTA. She's being reckless with your personal belongings", "NTA but I don\u2019t understand the dynamics here. If you\u2019re charging her for the things she borrows, then she\u2019s asking permission. And if she ruined that many things, why did you keep letting her borrow them in the first place?", "NTA", "NTA and you need a lock for your room!  You also need to talk to your parents about it because you need to start charging them for letting this happen.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re charging enough though. I would raise your prices.", "NTA if she keeps taking things without asking you and wrecks them she's gotta pay, literally. She wrecked you stuff for far too long, you should raise your prices even more so she will never touch it again.", "NTA and good on you, maybe she'll learn, maybe not. Any age after 2 is old enough to know not to take what isn't yours, and you parents are bad for enabling this behavior. Honestly I'd charge a bit more if it were me, but I guess I lucked out in not having sisters.", "NTA - but if you keep letting her do this to your stuff,  you're just contributing to her irresponsibility.   People learn respect and responsibility by people holding them accountable.   Sounds like your parents just excused all her errant behavior and she's just wild.", "NTA - But I\u2019d likely just stop lending her anything.", "Totally NTA. Get a lock for your door and do not lend her anything, ever. Problem solved.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
