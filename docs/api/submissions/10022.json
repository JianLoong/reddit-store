I'm assuming from what you posted that you're talking about claiming her as a dependent and taking the full deduction for her using her social security number and claiming a wide range of credits / debits on your taxes\n\n2. This is different than being able to claim and take credits for payments made, while $350 is agreeably a very low number to support a child, he is technically making some payments, and technically he is allowed to claim those payments on his taxes\n\n3. Since you are not married and you are not filing jointly quite frankly what he does on his taxes is not your problem. As long as you do everything you need to do correctly on your taxes that's all you need to worry about. Speak to an accountant make sure he understands exactly how much your daughter's father pays in support so that it's tracked formally within the federal and New York State tax systems. That's it, that's your full obligation\n\n4. Let your daughter's father do whatever he wants to do that is between him, his wife, his accountant and the government. If he claims too much with regards to your daughter chances are eventually he will be audited which may trigger an audit for you, as long as you are following the law this will not be a problem and this will generate a tremendous problem for him.\n\nMy recommendation is you simply say you do whatever you are legally allowed to do with your accountant, my understanding is the max that you would be able to show on your taxes is $350 a month when it's paid, beyond that I have no clue and as long as you're doing what's legal I'm fine with that. I will be following the letter of the law and filing my taxes as I have every year, if you generate any issues by falsifying claims, I will have legal representation ensure you are responsible for any fees I incur to defend myself in an audit.\n\nThat's all you need to do and after the conversation I would send him an email so that you have this for record keeping, print the email and keep it with your tax documents. He may break the law and get away with it many people do, he may not break the law, he may break the law and get caught. The great thing about all this is it has really very little to do with you, he can't screw you up unless you are falsifying your tax records and you both get audited", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Breast cancer has a really high survival rate now.). That was the final straw. Made my life much easier!", "My Mom didn\u2019t want me or my siblings to have negative feelings towards him.  She kept what was going on between them away from us as much as she could anyway.  We still saw stuff that we shouldn\u2019t have but in those cases it was beyond her control.  As we got older we saw him for what he was and how our Mom tried to protect us.  Now that we are all grown and no longer have a relationship with him she has been opening up about what he put her through.", "Good for you for putting your foot down and cutting him out and congrats on your mother for beating cancer XD", "So happy to hear that your Mom is a survivor.  I have two Aunts that are recent survivors and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of them."]}
