One being that he wouldn't show up to visits whenever he would  say he will come. Other things happen in between that made me take him to court. However ever since he started paying child support and tax season comes around the discussion arises that he should filing with her because he's the one \"supporting her\" ( I have always had a full-time job) (he gives 350 a month for background info and we live in NY)  I always have deny him to file with her because my daughter lives with me 95% of the time. He takes her every other Saturday and brings her back Sundays. He claims we \"have share custody\" therefore we should divide everything. Interesting because all of her needs are covered by me and we never divided that. Part of the child support and taxes go into accounts I have set up for college which apart from child support he has never contributed to that account. He claims he needs that because he wants to buy a house and I'm ruining his plans by being so miserable and needy for money and other insults I rather not share.  This has been going on for the past 10 years. So am I the asshole for denying him the tax credit. \n\nP.s.

It should include language on who claims the child.  If not IRS rules say whoever has more overnights.", "NTA your ex seems to think he's doing half the work when he's barely doing the minimum. He knows $350 is not enough to cover half the expenses and is just being an AH trying to not look so bad. You're right to don't let him use your daughter for his own benefit.", "NTA - I literally just looked this up a few minutes ago for my situation.  What I found \n\n Generally, the parent who provides the child's housing for most of the tax year gets to claim the child and the tax breaks. If the child lived with both parents equally, then the IRS requires the parent with the highest adjusted gross income to claim the child.", "NTA - but probably make sure you file taxes right away- I think in some places- legally either parent might be able to claim. Idk if that is specifically for 50/50 arrangements but you want to avoid the headache of having to manually send in your taxes.", "NTA.\n\nYou may need to speak to the attorney who you brought to court to get child support - he would know what the court order said. This is usually spelled out, as it's really common for an absentee parent to want all the financial benefits but complain about paying anything.", "NTA\n\nYou raised your daughter without his help for the most expensive years so far. Don't get me wrong, kids in the preteens are not cheap but diapers, formula, lack of sleep, etc. are all really the killers in those early-year childrearing times. \n\nMy wife has a friend who is going through something like this. They got pregnant, he left before their daughter was born, he rarely paid any child support, and was a piss-poor father to the kiddo. The mother had custody but tried to keep him involved to the detriment of all, but now he's asking to claim his daughter on his taxes this year, meanwhile she and her daughter were sleeping in their car for a couple nights when they had nowhere to go (we offered they could stay with us but she declined for some reason) until they were given the keys to their new apartment.", "NTA: if he wants to claim a kid, he has one to claim.", "NTA only you should be allowed to claim if daughter is living with you majorly of the time", "NTA. You have primary physical custody. You can/should check with your attorney for specifics.", "Will just add I live in Md and before my husband and I started to file jointly, only one of us was allowed to claim our child. If we were divorced in your situation the child that lives one more day then the other parent is only allowed to claim. Child support does come into factor though. But he pays almost nothing. I\u2019d appeal that child support.", "You claim her as a dependent as a custodian parent. He has his child as dependent. \n\nI think what he wants to do is to claim 2 kids for tax credit so he has pay less. Well she is your dependent.

But this is not that by any stretch.\n\nClaim her on your taxes. This is you having full custody with him getting occasional visitation. IMO, he has no legal claim for taxes purposes.\n\nNTA.", "This should be decided by the family court. Depending on his percentage of income going to child support and the state laws where you live, he might be entitled. (My ex and I have to swap).", "May seem popular but hear me out world before trying to tear me apart....\n\nOP, There are a few things to unpack here and address, it's not as straightforward as can he claim her or not...\n\n1. I'm assuming from what you posted that you're talking about claiming her as a dependent and taking the full deduction for her using her social security number and claiming a wide range of credits / debits on your taxes\n\n2. This is different than being able to claim and take credits for payments made, while $350 is agreeably a very low number to support a child, he is technically making some payments, and technically he is allowed to claim those payments on his taxes\n\n3. Since you are not married and you are not filing jointly quite frankly what he does on his taxes is not your problem. As long as you do everything you need to do correctly on your taxes that's all you need to worry about. Speak to an accountant make sure he understands exactly how much your daughter's father pays in support so that it's tracked formally within the federal and New York State tax systems. That's it, that's your full obligation\n\n4. Let your daughter's father do whatever he wants to do that is between him, his wife, his accountant and the government. If he claims too much with regards to your daughter chances are eventually he will be audited which may trigger an audit for you, as long as you are following the law this will not be a problem and this will generate a tremendous problem for him.\n\nMy recommendation is you simply say you do whatever you are legally allowed to do with your accountant, my understanding is the max that you would be able to show on your taxes is $350 a month when it's paid, beyond that I have no clue and as long as you're doing what's legal I'm fine with that. I will be following the letter of the law and filing my taxes as I have every year, if you generate any issues by falsifying claims, I will have legal representation ensure you are responsible for any fees I incur to defend myself in an audit.\n\nThat's all you need to do and after the conversation I would send him an email so that you have this for record keeping, print the email and keep it with your tax documents. He may break the law and get away with it many people do, he may not break the law, he may break the law and get caught. The great thing about all this is it has really very little to do with you, he can't screw you up unless you are falsifying your tax records and you both get audited", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That doesn't make sense either bc there are people who pay child support and see their kids once a month. I'm not sure what state you live in but the IRS is very clear about what type of living situation counts to claim a dependent.", "I agree completely, and you said it far more succinctly then I did, let him decide whatever the hell he wants to do with his accountant, but I would put him on notice if he Fs anything up for her she will come after him to pay for any fees and advice she needs to get to defend herself", "Unreal?
