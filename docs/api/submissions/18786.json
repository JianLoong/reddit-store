She has taken part in a parade before and enjoyed it. We spent a couple hours there, then she was going to walk home and leave me to meet friends.\n\nI was surprised when my father showed up to pick up my mum. He\u2019s always been very homophobic and I couldn\u2019t imagine him coming near an event like this.\n\nAside from the homophobia, he simply was not a good father to me. He never showed love or spent time with me and I can count the kind things he did for me on one hand. Due to also being racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, and generally hateful, he is just a bad person. This combined with a lot of bullying and emotional abuse from when I was small is why I chose not to have a relationship to him.\n\nA few days passed and I spoke to my brother (37) on the phone. He was similar to my father growing up, including bullying me. We have since healed the relationship by him changing and apologising for past behaviour. We are not super close, but speak maybe once a month. He has a good relationship with my father.\n\nMy brother said he had something hard to tell me, he had spoken to my father who had \u2018broken down in tears\u2019 that he has tried endlessly to repair his relationship with me, but nothing he can do is good enough. Apparently turning up to Pride, saying hello and immediately leaving was his way of accepting me and trying to have a relationship with me.\n\nI don\u2019t believe it. I am not open to the idea that he has changed because he is still an emotionally abusive and manipulative POS to my mum. He has also never said anything to me at all that would even hint he was trying to make amends, including on the day of Pride.\n\nWhen I told my mum about this, she said she didn\u2019t know he was upset but mentioned that a few years ago, I was getting married (but broke up beforehand) and he wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding. When they had a fight, she said something along the lines of \u2018there\u2019s no wonder Icidahob doesn\u2019t want you at his wedding or in his life\u2019 and he got the most upset she\u2019d seen him in years.\n\nMy brother said it\u2019s on me to reach out and begin to heal the relationship, I flat out said no. He was outraged, and said I was an AH for not caring. But I don\u2019t care, I simply don\u2019t, I\u2019ve had therapy for years and accepted that I don\u2019t have a father in my life. \n\nSome childhood friends agree with my brother, because whenever they\u2019ve met my father he\u2019s been polite, never seeing what happened behind closed doors. Some of my gay friends said they\u2019d love to be able to mend relationships with their fathers and I\u2019m lucky. \n\nSo, AITA for not doing anything with my father\u2019s pathetic \u2018gesture\u2019?", "created_utc": 1685713971, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ydfyw/aita_for_not_accepting_my_fathers_gesture_of/", "score": 273, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s never get the person to\nTake responsibility for their actions. \nGranted for OPs third person reports he does seem like he regrets his actions. There is however no evidence that he has made any changes or tried to do anything to change the status of his currently relationship with OP.\nIf he wants to mend the relationship then maybe he should ask the OP to talk to him or find out what he needs to change for him to get to that point. Doing what you think is some sort of gesture and hoping that OP will see it as this grand thing and getting disappointed when OP doesn\u2019t is kinda childish tbh. \nThe dad needs to realize that forgiveness is not about him it\u2019s about OP.", "NTA. It\u2019s never the job of the child to reach out to the parent to mend relationships", "NTA, he sucks and it sounds like he hasn't done any real work on himself. If he really wanted to reconnect, he'd make material and concrete steps to improve his behavior. He should go to therapy, and demonstrate he no longer holds those views, and the best way to do so is in service to the communities that he so loathed. Work with LGBT+ orgs, women's shelters, immigrant help centers etc. Probably most of all, treat your mother better and with respect. And all of that should be done, not with the goal of talking to you, but to truly be a better person.\n\nIf and when those conditions are met, and genuine contrition for his actions are demonstrated, then you can let him into you life on your own discretion.\n\nToo often misdeeds are rugswept in the name of \"politeness\" \"family\" \"keeping the peace\" and it's just a shitty spackle job on the gaping hole in the wall.", "NTA in any way, shape or form. Maybe your dad does want to repair your relationship, but his attempts have been pathetic at best. If you ever do feel like you should at least give it the old college try, then you should be clear with him (and your brother and mother) at what exactly you are looking for when it comes to the changed behavior, apologies, and support you expect from him. Showing up to pick up your mom from the parade may have felt like a huge step to him, but it\u2019s a far cry from actually making an effort to show YOU the support a true father should. You are NOT required to give him anymore chances at a relationship, but if you feel so led, make it very clear to him that the absolute bare minimum will never be good enough and tell him what ACTUAL effort would look like.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him anything, it\u2019s up to you to decide whether you\u2019re willing to let him back into your life or not.

If not, outright lied to your brother about his attempts to reconnect with you.\n\nThis behaviour wouldn't be out of character for him, based on what you've told us of the man.\n\nTo me, it seems like he wants to be in your life, just not enough to actually change the behaviour that alienated him from you in the first place.", "NTA. Not one bit. \n\nYou do not owe your father ANYTHING. He is a grown man who can very definitely give you a call or drop a message asking to talk.

Your brother and those childhood friends do not what you have been through, they have not felt the years of countless abuse that you have.

You mentioned your surprise at him even showing up to Pride, but then he just said hi and left. While it was a pathetic gesture to you, as you said before, it was way out of character for him to even show up to pick up your mom, so maybe that's something? If your brother is being honest, it sounds like your dad may be having regrets, but has no idea how to go about talking to you about it and thought that showing up at Pride for a minute would be a good start. Having said all this, it's completely up to you how you want to handle this, but again, NTA.", "NTA. I have had a parent come back into my life or \"Make an effort\" now that I'm older and as far as I'm concerned its too little too late. you don't need to subject yourself to somebody just because they are family. if you don't want to forgive him and don't what him around or even present more than he is thats totally up to you. you don't owe anybody an explanation.", "It sounds like your dad really was making an effort. I get that bad childhoods are rough, and you\u2019re the only one who gets to decide if you have a relationship.

He hasn't said anything to you.", "YTA, big time.\n\nYou\u2019ve essentially made him your whipping post for your own self righteousness, and since he can\u2019t change or you\u2019d lose that, you refuse to allow him to make any gestures, make any steps in the right direction. That\u2019s not what a good person does. A good person is open to growth and change in another, and welcomes positive steps. \n\nYou\u2019ve painted dad into a corner, refuse to let him out of the corner, and then blame him for being in the corner. Who\u2019s to blame there, the person in the corner, or the person holding the paint can?", "You don't seem to have anything in mind that he could possibly do that you would accept: you are \"not open to the idea\", you \"don't have a father\".\n\nYou have no good words to say for him. The words you have are angry and bitter. You seem to feel hurt. \n\nThe ball is in your court. You don't have to do anything with it. Parents are imperfect and, being people of their times, usually do what they know how. Consider that it will have cost him something to reach out by coming to Pride.\n\nIf you are 100% certain that you never want to see or speak with him again, that's OK.

You already accepted you don\u2019t need a father, and needs to do more meaningful work than \u201cpicking mom up from Pride\u201d.", "NTA in any way. \n\nHonestly, it is never up to adult children to make things up to theie shit.parenrs, ever.", "NTA.. nobody should be forced to be around hatedul people like this..", "NTA\n\nIf dad wants to make amends he needs to put for genuine effort and show contrition.\n\nA start might be to attend PFLAG and talk with any other parents about how they had a genuine change of heart and worked to rebuild a relationship with their gay child. He needs to admit he treated you horribly and accept responsibility for that.", "NTA.  You need to do what you must for your own well being and mental health.  However, ask your brother to ask Dad for specific examples of how he has reached out to you with his heart/to heart to mend the fence.  Use the Pride as an example of how was that supposed to be taken as acceptance vs. actually being their for the whole event.  Yes, its nice to want to mend the relationship but it seems its all in your Dad's head and how he is portraying it to others.  No real communication to you and its not on you since he is the one who was s\\*it for Dad.  Its up to him to start the real conversation.  Him showing up and you forgiving all does not work since he never had a relationship with you.", "NTA, this is just manipulation.", "NTA but this situation is very complex, on one end you could argue your dad is having severe issues getting over how he was raised which is often with older generations. However, you\u2019re both now adults and if he believes you two would instantly be a happy father and son over small \u201cgestures\u201d, it\u2019s not happening. It sucks but it\u2019s the truth, you can\u2019t heal a relationship that hasn\u2019t been present nor healthy for your own being overnight.", "Nta, he continues manipulation through others...", "NTA. My formerly homophobic mother currently has a Puerto Rican rainbow pride flag hanging in her room. She couldn\u2019t wait to show me. An actual gesture can\u2019t be mistaken for basic civility.", "NTA - I have found it frustrating through the years when others have projected their own grief and unresolved relationships onto my situation. While I may appreciate their sense of regret it often feels like they are speaking to their own story and not mine. However, I wouldn\u2019t completely negate the actions of your Dad. Maybe his overture in time and with reflection might present an opportunity to engage him, if mending the relationship at some point feels important to you. At the least you might want to remain open to the possibility even if you choose not to act on it at the moment. No one should be pressing you into action...", "NTA. It's never the wronged person's responsibility to reach out. Your dad is the one who messed up. He's the one that has to reach out and he's the one that has to make amends. Actions speak louder than words, so why would you believe whatever your brother is saying when you haven't seen any evidence of it from your father?", "NTA. Brother is pushing you because he knows that your father isn\u2019t going to change in any way that matters. The only chance of something working is if you decide to lower your standards so close to the ground that your father saying hello to you in the proximity of other gay people counts as a gesture. He was too homophobic to spend Pride with you and your mom. Mom probably convinced him to pick her up as a favor to her. You don\u2019t have to work for a relationship with someone who could maybe learn to tolerate you despite being gay. You owe him nothing- no effort, no forgiveness. Do what\u2019s best for you.", "NTA. If he wants a relationship with you, he needs to AT LEAST sincerely apologize. He wronged you, so it\u2019s on him to reach out.", "NTA.   \nYour father was/is abusive, homophobic and a whole list of names - he did not offer anything and ultimately broke the relationship. This is on him to fix.    \nHe picked up your mother, said hello (how nice) and left - that gesture tells me that he cares about your mother, to pick her up. That is no way is a gesture towards you. \n\nYour father is manipulating you through your brother, by expecting you to repair the relationship your brother is imparting blame on *you*. You are the son, the child, he failed at his duty as a parent.\n\nKeep those who support and love you close and do not reflect negatively on yourself for any of this.", "Tell your brother your dad ignored your gesture of reconciliation when you gave his wife a ride somewhere and did a half hand raise to acknowledge his presence. Basically bring up any time when you were in the vicinity of your father and say those were all gestures of reconciliation that he ignored.", "NTA\n\ndoes he go pick someone up from a marathon they ran in and say he participated? would hr count that as supporting that person? probably not. all he did was pick your mother up. and how on earth were you supposed to know that picking his wife up was some grand gesture? because it wasn\u2019t. a grand gesture would have been going to the parade and being a supportive father, giving your mom a ride home from the parade after you guys were done doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you at all. \n\nand it\u2019s not on you to mend a relationship someone else broke, especially if that relationship was broken bc they didn\u2019t accept you for who you are.", "NTA.\n\nIf your father wants to have a relationship with you, your father can actually put some effort in to it. Your brother? TA. He's asking YOU to do all the work since your father apparently can't. You've already admitted your father is an ass for multiple reasons.", "NTA. This is a heartbreaking situation. It's very difficult to be raised by an abusive parent. It's also very difficult for men of older generations to accept a gay son. \n\nMy father was not abusive to my brother; he pretty much ignored that my brother is gay. He was polite to friends and attended my brother's wedding. I think that that's pretty good for his generation - born in 1930s.\n\nSince your dad has been abusive, I agree that he needs to do more than show up to be your mom's ride. He could at least share the feelings of wanting a relationship with you and apologize for past errors.", "YTA. I am going to get downvoted to hell for this. But you know what? people suck, and very few people repair who they are. Your dad wants this, but can't talk to you about it, because of whatever's wrong with him. I think you should try, once, to give him a chance to repair and make amends. Tell him exactly what you need: an apology, a promise to do better, and never, ever speaking an ill word about a group, race, etc etc etc. If he can't provide those things, then he doesn't really want to put the work in to be your dad. But if he can, I think you should meet him the tiniest way. I have been here. Not with my identity, but with other things. If people can never get forgiveness or an opportunity to start over, they'll never be better and will never try. I found value with relationship with the family member in question, after I did open the door to conditional reconciliation.  \nI'm sorry for what you've been through.", "Probably did the old throwing water on face crying routine", "If he wants to get closer he should do an exercise of responsibility and start by asking you for forgiveness for all the damage he may have caused you.", "It\u2019s because the person who caused the damage can\u2019t be the bigger person.", "Yes OP\n\nA sorry doesn't heal a trauma.", "I'm going through something similar with a parent. It's ridiculous how parents will think the smallest \"gesture\" (if this can even be called that) can make up for years of mistreatment. Then they make you feel like the bad guy for not accepting it.\n\nIf that's not good enough for you, stand by it. You have no obligation to forgive someone who has done little to nothing to make up for their behavior.", "Why do bad parents never realize this??", "[removed]", "I would hesitate to say he even \u201cturned up\u201d at Pride. He popped in to pick someone up and wasn\u2019t an open asshole about it. And that\u2019s it? Totally agree there doesn\u2019t seem like much attempt. Honestly if this was me I don\u2019t think it would occur to me that this was some sort of gesture and at most I would think he was nice to mom to pick her up so she didn\u2019t have to worry about parking.", "Picking mom up at Pride sounds more like something mom got him to do as a favor to her when he wasn\u2019t willing to spend any time there. If showing his face in the proximity of Pride is such a big deal that it counts as a meaningful gesture to him, he is still hella homophobic. No one has an obligation to build a relationship with a parent who in time could learn to tolerate who they are, or a parent who could maybe manage to have a cordial relationship despite who they are. OP deserves more than that.", "\n\n>It sounds like your dad really was making an effort\n\nthe bar literally could not be any lower. how sad.", "And three steps backwards when he decided to throw a fit, blame OP for not immediately welcoming him back into his life, and turn his brother against him.", "showing up after the event to pick up your wife is about as trivial as it's possible to get. I don't care how big of a step it was for him.", "What motivates you to make these accusations?  They can't be coming from anything in OP's story.\n\nFor example, why would you claim that OP refuses to allow him to make any gestures?  You dont have any example of him even trying to make a gesture, so how could you decide that?", "What gesture has the father made? Is OP supposed to forgive his father because he was at a pride parade for a few minutes without stating anything? Let the father make a real gesture first.", "no painted him in a coner but him, and op hardly needs to 'hold the paint can'. dad isn't in interested in cleaning up the mess to being with.", "What did it cost the father by showing up to pride for a few moments and saying nothing? Is that really the best the father can do?", "OPs father and I are the same age, so let's not make homophobia a generational thing. Dad can grow and change but he seems interested in neither.", "but he didn\u2019t \u201ccome to Pride\u201d - he picked his mother up at Pride to give her a ride home. going to Pride is what his mother did, she actually\u2026.you know\u2026.went.", "\n\n>But Dad isn't the asshole in this one situation.\n\nhe doesn't have to say anything to be an asshole. he's a bigot. thats enough to declare him an asshole just for being who he is.", "\ud83e\udd23", "And absolutely no-one can tell the survivor when to forgive or accept a non apology.

When I was between the ages of six and 11, my mother could not show any love or affection. In my opinion, she was emotionally and physically abusive. I'm much older now, and I do love my mother. I also came to understand that this was how she was brought up. It's not an excuse but understandable. She has done a lot to change as well. We now have a healthy relationship. I can not forget about how it was for those years. I have a little bit better understanding about it, though.", "I\u2019d guess most bad parents don\u2019t think they\u2019re bad parents. They usually raise you how their parents raised them and don\u2019t see the issue and don\u2019t think it\u2019s problematic.", "My question exactly", "He was only interested in a relationship with you as long as it didn\u2019t actually require any open defiance of dad.", "Fair, dad stood in the corner.

I dunno. Mind boggles.", "Well that isn't the point of this board.  No sagas.  \n\nSurely OP doesn't need the internet to tell her a bigot is an asshole.  This is a question about this ONE conflict.  Not a lifetime of behavior.", "How do you figure? no one else forced him to be racist, Xenophobic, misogynistic, If he is choosing to Continue to carry these beliefs with him that's not someone else keeping him in the corner that is him doing it to himself, Not to mention his choice to be abusive to his son for a majority of his life.\n\n It is not the responsibility of the abused to extend an Olive branch to the abuser. He could get out of this corner that he painted himself into if he actually changed his behavior, and briefly showing up in a car to a pride event, Just to pick up your wife, is not that. \n\nHe could even just start by making an apology, stop acting like he has no recourse in the situation. , he got himself into it and he can get himself out of it if he learns how to behave like a Decent person", "\n\n>And that second part isn\u2019t of his own doing\n\nbullshit. if he actually wanted out of the coner he'd put some fucking effort into it.", "You didn't name a single gesture the father made. He \"flat out said no\" to his BROTHER, who told him it was his responsibility to make the first move to bridge the distance between him and his father. You know, you have to read the full sentences if you want to understand them. All those words in there are important, every one of them mean something and contribute to a bigger idea trying to be expressed.", "I feel like we'd need to see some gestures before we could really say something like that.", "Holding people to a behavior standard is not abuse. I keep one at all times, my threshold of minimally acceptable behavior may be different from someone elses, but that is for each person to decide for themselves.", "It seems to me you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what abuse between adults is if you're equating OP not taking first steps at mending a relationship that OP's father destroyed = abuse. I don't follow this line of thinking at all, other than perhaps you overuse the term to mean anything short of unearned forgiveness and kindness. ETA: another possible line of thinking is if you assume subjecting a child to an environment of bigotry isn't worth severing the relationship over. Father has proven to be an unsafe individual. Why wouldn't you advocate he proves to OP he is now safe?", "His father showed up at an event the OP would not have expected him to historically go anywhere near.\n\nHis father broke down in tears of regret to the brother.\n\nHis father showed how upset he was not being invited to the wedding, worst episode his wife had seen in years.\n\nThose ARE gestures.
