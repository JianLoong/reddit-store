She has taken part in a parade before and enjoyed it. We spent a couple hours there, then she was going to walk home and leave me to meet friends.\n\nI was surprised when my father showed up to pick up my mum. He\u2019s always been very homophobic and I couldn\u2019t imagine him coming near an event like this.\n\nAside from the homophobia, he simply was not a good father to me. He never showed love or spent time with me and I can count the kind things he did for me on one hand. Due to also being racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, and generally hateful, he is just a bad person. This combined with a lot of bullying and emotional abuse from when I was small is why I chose not to have a relationship to him.\n\nA few days passed and I spoke to my brother (37) on the phone. He was similar to my father growing up, including bullying me. We have since healed the relationship by him changing and apologising for past behaviour. We are not super close, but speak maybe once a month. He has a good relationship with my father.\n\nMy brother said he had something hard to tell me, he had spoken to my father who had \u2018broken down in tears\u2019 that he has tried endlessly to repair his relationship with me, but nothing he can do is good enough. Apparently turning up to Pride, saying hello and immediately leaving was his way of accepting me and trying to have a relationship with me.\n\nI don\u2019t believe it. I am not open to the idea that he has changed because he is still an emotionally abusive and manipulative POS to my mum. He has also never said anything to me at all that would even hint he was trying to make amends, including on the day of Pride.\n\nWhen I told my mum about this, she said she didn\u2019t know he was upset but mentioned that a few years ago, I was getting married (but broke up beforehand) and he wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding. When they had a fight, she said something along the lines of \u2018there\u2019s no wonder Icidahob doesn\u2019t want you at his wedding or in his life\u2019 and he got the most upset she\u2019d seen him in years.\n\nMy brother said it\u2019s on me to reach out and begin to heal the relationship, I flat out said no. He was outraged, and said I was an AH for not caring. But I don\u2019t care, I simply don\u2019t, I\u2019ve had therapy for years and accepted that I don\u2019t have a father in my life. \n\nSome childhood friends agree with my brother, because whenever they\u2019ve met my father he\u2019s been polite, never seeing what happened behind closed doors. Some of my gay friends said they\u2019d love to be able to mend relationships with their fathers and I\u2019m lucky. \n\nSo, AITA for not doing anything with my father\u2019s pathetic \u2018gesture\u2019?", "created_utc": 1685713971, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ydfyw/aita_for_not_accepting_my_fathers_gesture_of/", "score": 1707, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Showing up to pick up your mother is not a gesture of reconciliation - and neither is using your brother to guilt you to accepting it.

It\u2019s never get the person to\nTake responsibility for their actions. \nGranted for OPs third person reports he does seem like he regrets his actions. There is however no evidence that he has made any changes or tried to do anything to change the status of his currently relationship with OP.\nIf he wants to mend the relationship then maybe he should ask the OP to talk to him or find out what he needs to change for him to get to that point. Doing what you think is some sort of gesture and hoping that OP will see it as this grand thing and getting disappointed when OP doesn\u2019t is kinda childish tbh. \nThe dad needs to realize that forgiveness is not about him it\u2019s about OP.", "NTA. It\u2019s never the job of the child to reach out to the parent to mend relationships", "NTA, he sucks and it sounds like he hasn't done any real work on himself. If he really wanted to reconnect, he'd make material and concrete steps to improve his behavior. He should go to therapy, and demonstrate he no longer holds those views, and the best way to do so is in service to the communities that he so loathed. Work with LGBT+ orgs, women's shelters, immigrant help centers etc. Probably most of all, treat your mother better and with respect. And all of that should be done, not with the goal of talking to you, but to truly be a better person.\n\nIf and when those conditions are met, and genuine contrition for his actions are demonstrated, then you can let him into you life on your own discretion.\n\nToo often misdeeds are rugswept in the name of \"politeness\" \"family\" \"keeping the peace\" and it's just a shitty spackle job on the gaping hole in the wall.", "NTA in any way, shape or form. Maybe your dad does want to repair your relationship, but his attempts have been pathetic at best. If you ever do feel like you should at least give it the old college try, then you should be clear with him (and your brother and mother) at what exactly you are looking for when it comes to the changed behavior, apologies, and support you expect from him. Showing up to pick up your mom from the parade may have felt like a huge step to him, but it\u2019s a far cry from actually making an effort to show YOU the support a true father should. You are NOT required to give him anymore chances at a relationship, but if you feel so led, make it very clear to him that the absolute bare minimum will never be good enough and tell him what ACTUAL effort would look like.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him anything, it\u2019s up to you to decide whether you\u2019re willing to let him back into your life or not.

During this short time, he was polite towards you.\n\nI don't see any attempt at reconciliation on his part here? Does showing up to collect his wife and saying hello to you count as \"trying endlessly\" to reconcile?\n\nIt seems like your father has embellished the truth. If not, outright lied to your brother about his attempts to reconnect with you.\n\nThis behaviour wouldn't be out of character for him, based on what you've told us of the man.\n\nTo me, it seems like he wants to be in your life, just not enough to actually change the behaviour that alienated him from you in the first place.", "NTA. Not one bit. \n\nYou do not owe your father ANYTHING. He is a grown man who can very definitely give you a call or drop a message asking to talk.

He is grieving the loss of a son and is probably realising at the age he is, that he\u2019s made some mistakes. \n\nI am happy to know you have a good relationship with your mum. Your brother and those childhood friends do not what you have been through, they have not felt the years of countless abuse that you have.

You mentioned your surprise at him even showing up to Pride, but then he just said hi and left. While it was a pathetic gesture to you, as you said before, it was way out of character for him to even show up to pick up your mom, so maybe that's something? If your brother is being honest, it sounds like your dad may be having regrets, but has no idea how to go about talking to you about it and thought that showing up at Pride for a minute would be a good start. Having said all this, it's completely up to you how you want to handle this, but again, NTA.", "NTA. I have had a parent come back into my life or \"Make an effort\" now that I'm older and as far as I'm concerned its too little too late. you don't need to subject yourself to somebody just because they are family. if you don't want to forgive him and don't what him around or even present more than he is thats totally up to you. you don't owe anybody an explanation.", "It sounds like your dad really was making an effort. I get that bad childhoods are rough, and you\u2019re the only one who gets to decide if you have a relationship. BUT if he\u2019s as awful as you say and took this tiny step of being near Pride, it really does sound like he is trying. \n\nNAH.", "NAH\n\nYou don't have to do anything to work on the relationship.  \n\nThird party opinions don't matter.  \n\nBut Dad isn't the asshole in this one situation.  He hasn't said anything to you.", "YTA, big time.\n\nYou\u2019ve essentially made him your whipping post for your own self righteousness, and since he can\u2019t change or you\u2019d lose that, you refuse to allow him to make any gestures, make any steps in the right direction. That\u2019s not what a good person does. A good person is open to growth and change in another, and welcomes positive steps. \n\nYou\u2019ve painted dad into a corner, refuse to let him out of the corner, and then blame him for being in the corner. Who\u2019s to blame there, the person in the corner, or the person holding the paint can?", "You don't seem to have anything in mind that he could possibly do that you would accept: you are \"not open to the idea\", you \"don't have a father\".\n\nYou have no good words to say for him. The words you have are angry and bitter. You seem to feel hurt. \n\nThe ball is in your court. You don't have to do anything with it. Parents are imperfect and, being people of their times, usually do what they know how. Consider that it will have cost him something to reach out by coming to Pride.\n\nIf you are 100% certain that you never want to see or speak with him again, that's OK.

Keep in mind, it's not just \"him\" that's wrong, but his education, his parents, his teachers, his parents' parents, basically his whole life and way of thinking is \"wrong.\" **That's tough, to feel like your life was a lie.** So for him, this *may have actually been* him trying to reach out to you, but it's scary to go to a place you'd rather not be at, surrounded by people you don't agree with. He's just as scared as you but his own pride isn't going to admit it, which only furthers his willingness to be abusive.

First, you aren\u2019t the AH, you have every right to feel the way you do, and you don\u2019t owe him anything. Just like I\u2019d have said to myself decades ago when this all happened to me.

Some people are too far gone and the damage done too great. But if there is any chance that having a relationship could be a benefit to you, it might do you well to give him **a** chance.

Whining and crying to OP\u2019s brother or mom isn\u2019t doing anything. He has made no effort to talk to OP directly and apologize. You\u2019re really reaching to defend an abuser.", "NTA. My parents were also homophobic my whole life, and I had a conversation with my mom a couple years back in which she expressed frustration with my inability to give her credit for how much work she's put in to learning and changing since I've moved across the country. And it floored me--the only thing that had changed externally was she no longer told me I was going to hell. That's it. Still voted for anti-LGBTQ politicians, never asked me about my life, never did anything at all that felt like more than keeping quiet to avoid drama.\n\nAnd you know what? That doesn't count, especially when the other person built the wall up between you in the first place. But I think sometimes people doing a lot of internal work might forget that it may have taken immense effort for them to do that much, but until it breaks the surface, they're only halfway. You can explain that to your dad, or another family member, if you want, but you also don't owe him reaching out. If he is so hurt by a lack of relationship, it's up to him, as both your father and a person who hurt you, to step up and try to make amends. And if he wants that, he needs to understand it is *work.*", "It's not on you to fix your dad's relationship with you.\n\nNTA", "YTA", "NTA...your Dad sending in your brother to do his dirty work for him wouldn't fly with me either as a real apology or attempt to mend fences. Dad should reach out himself with a genuine \"I fucked up\" admission if he wants to be taken seriously...but even then you aren't obligated to forgive and forget.", "NTA. You\u2019ve done a lot of work to get to a healthy place with all this.", "NTA. I think people like this are often emotionally stunted and don't have the tools to grasp their feelings or articulate themselves, which leads to their homophobia/other phobias in the first place. Maybe there is something deep within your dad that compels him to really want to reconnect with you, maybe not. But also even if there is, he has such rigid views and ego and pride that he can't let go and simply say he is sorry. It seems simple to well adjusted people, but saying sorry is often the hardest thing ever for people like this. If you want to, you could write a letter as like a \"last statement\" to him, almost like a victim impact statement, and detail how he wronged you, and why you have found it impossible to maintain contact with him, and what it would take - even as a first step - to mend the relationship. And that first step involves a comprehensive apology from the heart from him. If he is not willing to do that, well then, you kept your side of the street clean, right? You did all you could and was generous even to make that last statement, and the lack of relationship will forever clearly be on his own head.", "NTA. Your relationship with your father must be entirely your choice, your decision. If you are comfortable having nothing to do with your father, for whatever reason, that's fine. I will point out that we get only one set of parents, flawed as they may be. If you cannot be the \"bigger\" person and try to mend fences, then it's a decision you'll have to live with. Every family is different. So how your friends feel about their estranged fathers is interesting, but doesn't have to influence your behavior. You are your own person. As a gay man, you know it takes a degree of internal strength to know yourself and to live your truth.", "NTA if you don\u2019t feel it\u2019s enough it\u2019s not, but it might be worth acknowledging the \u201ceffort\u201d minimal as it seems to him it might be huge, or the start of something that could be a big change but if it is rejected he\u2019ll never change. Think of it like positive reinforcement. \u201cI noticed you were there to pick mom up.  Thank you.\u201d (Here\u2019s a cookie, good boy).", "NTA is not *YOUR* job to reach out and mend the relationship. *You* didn't break it. If he really wants to mend the relationship, *HE* needs to reach out, make the effort, and accept that it's going to take a long time, if at all. Just going to pick someone up and leaving is not a gesture. Calling you and apologizing would be a gesture. Actually attending Pride would be a gesture. Doing literally nothing constructive and then crying to your brother and waiting for him to pressure you into fixing it isn't how to go about things.", "This was a pretty safe,place to ask if you wanted most people to agree with you. I won\u2019t judge you as I don\u2019t know your situation, but as someone who has lost both parents I think the best choice is to give him a chance. You don\u2019t have to have a great relationship, but you can each gain some understanding of each other.", "NTA, why is it up too you, the victim, to reach out and make amends? That\u2019s fucked up. I also think your dad is manipulating your brother and twisting the truth, what little truth he gives.", "NTA. He can\u2019t undo a million negative acts and words with one very tiny slightly positive action. Not when there is zero trust and zero change from him. Even if he goes through the motions it means little if he doesn\u2019t truly accept you - all of you, including your sexuality.", "NTA. Picking someone up from a pride event doesn't even count as the bare minimum. It doesn't even count as attending pride. This guy sounds like a complete TA and it is absolutely, 100% on him to actually put in some real effort if he wants a relationship. Your brother is also TA for putting the onus on you.", "NTA.\n\nParticularly because your brother is dead wrong. It is on _your father_ to come to you and ask for a second chance. So far, he hasn't.\n\nWhen he does, it'll be your call. But second and third hand reports of remorse ain't really the same thing, so I'd say this talk of reconciliation is premature.\n\nThat man is _not_ yet trying to get in your good graces, and this is a conversation for when he actually begins to do so.", "Of that's you father and brother's idea of a gesture then they're in for a rude awakening. A gesture would have been showing up and asking how you're doing, offering to meet for coffee sometime to talk, telling you he's had some time to think things through and had some realizations he'd like to share. Not just show up and immediately leave. Good grief. As for your friends, sure they wish they could reconcile with their parents, but they forget that each person has their own experience. It doesn't detract from theirs if you don't want to get tangled up in your father's drama.\n\nNTA.", "Sometimes, family doesn't feel like family. Society puts a lot of pressure on people to have a happy functioning family and to treasure those family bonds. But what about toxic family? \n\n\nIn my perspective, a long conversation with your dad could ultimately help both of you. It just sounds to me like he isn't sure how to communicate with you. But it's your call. Was your dad really, so bad that he never deserves forgiveness? Ever? He's in his 60s too. His time on earth is coming to an end. From my experience, it may be best to make amends while he's still alive or you could regret it for a long time. Maybe you won't. But time is a limited resource.\n\n\nEither way, good luck, and I hope you enjoy the rest of pride.\n\n\nForgot my rating: NTA, what goes around comes around always. but dad won't be around forever.", "NTA \n\nHe basically went, \u201cI did the barest of bare minimums and acknowledged that you\u2019re allowed to exist. \u2026Wait, WHY ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME?!\u201d", "Honestly using every \"phobic\" to describe a person I find you not credible or over-exaggerate what happened.", "NTA\n\nJust go NC with daddy dearest and keep in touch with your mother. \n\nI'd be wary of your brother. Yes, he's acknowledged his past transgressions but that kind of ingrained hatred coupled with his quick defense of your hateful father should serve as a caution to monitor his true intentions as well.", "It was a very difficult first step from him tbh\n\nAnd at least he tried\n\nI know it ain't much and hardly makes up for the years of homophobic but at least he tried\n\nI think YTA", "It's a two-way street.  That starts with a small step on each side. You need to reach out, but remain respectful.  My Dad did something similar.  Took me a long time to get over it. But ultimately it's up to you about what you want to do. I'd say your nta. You were thrown for a loop and Don't know how to react.", "NTA showing up briefly then quickly leaving a Pride event does not equal acceptance. Near as I can tell he is more focused on how he feels than what he put you through to say nothing of the fact that his actions necessitated you needing therapy.", "Is this the dads way to blame OP? Now he can say he attempted to have a relationship and OP rejected him.", "Him showing up for a couple minutes reminds me of the difference between tolerance and inclusion\n\nTolerance is saying okay fine I guess you can be gay around me and I won't say anything\n\nInclusion is saying youre gay and you are 100% as important as everyone else and I want to hear about your diverse experience because I value that you bring that to the table", "Also, even if that did happen... ***what the hell was he crying about!!!*** OP isn't psychic. How the hell was he supposed to know that his dad picking up his mom was anything special?!", "I\u2019m in a similar boat \n\nYou will ALWAYS have people in your family or who are friends who have the opinion \u201cBuT iTs YoUR dAD\u201d\u2026.\n\nOnly YOU know your father, YOU have years of first hand experience with his B.S. and honest to Dog it\u2019s the same crap on repeat with the manipulation.\n\nYou are not obligated to reciprocate his \u201ceffort\u201d, and YOU know he hasn\u2019t actually changed. He\u2019s probably a narcissist who sees that you\u2019ve got a somewhat functional relationship with your brother, and tells tall tales to your brother in hopes to guilt trip you into communicating with your dad.\n\nI have this beautiful statement well recited \u201cit is not my responsibility to control how other people view the relationship or lack of that I have with individual people. You and I have the relationship that we have. Do not try to influence my decisions that I have made in keeping my mental well being.\u201d", "It\u2019s sounds like OP didn\u2019t even get a sorry\u2026", "> Yet I'm not allowed to set the record straight.\n\nThis! \n\nLike, it would be the ultimate crime or something. Calling the police, telling his friends, people he knows, people he works with, even if I\u2019m just answering a direct question with 100% honesty,  *still* to me somehow feels like it would be a nuclear option. \n\nAnd why is this? I\u2019m NC and so is my mom but all of us are for some reason still protecting him? We could blow his shit up at any moment, and why haven\u2019t we? Because fuck knows what he\u2019d do, and it\u2019s not even worth it. He would just make it go sideways somehow and have it fall back on us.

I hope you can heal for yourself.", ">Those ARE gestures. Are they shitty ones? Maybe. But they are there. It isn\u2019t me failing to read, my friend.\n\nlol says alot about you and how you treat people if such things should be treated as big things. Its a pathetic excuse of a someone who refuses to actually make amends. \n\nThis is on OPs father to make proper amends not OP since OP didnt do anything wrong.", "Sure the onus is on the dad, but if op really wanted a relationship he could engage to help it along. He doesn't have to but I'm not sure how refusing to reach out will help progress the relationship.", "Then what kind of relationship would OP be getting? Did you read the description he had of his father? I don\u2019t think OP is looking for a relationship with that guy if he can\u2019t change even a little bit, and he hasn\u2019t done anything to change."]}
