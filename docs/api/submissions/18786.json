We do not spend time together or communicate at all, apart from small talk when I\u2019m at home (he and my mum (56) are still together, I have a very good relationship with her).\n\nI am gay, and me and my mum went to the local Pride recently. She has taken part in a parade before and enjoyed it. We spent a couple hours there, then she was going to walk home and leave me to meet friends.\n\nI was surprised when my father showed up to pick up my mum. He\u2019s always been very homophobic and I couldn\u2019t imagine him coming near an event like this.\n\nAside from the homophobia, he simply was not a good father to me. He never showed love or spent time with me and I can count the kind things he did for me on one hand. Due to also being racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, and generally hateful, he is just a bad person. This combined with a lot of bullying and emotional abuse from when I was small is why I chose not to have a relationship to him.\n\nA few days passed and I spoke to my brother (37) on the phone. He was similar to my father growing up, including bullying me. We have since healed the relationship by him changing and apologising for past behaviour. We are not super close, but speak maybe once a month. He has a good relationship with my father.\n\nMy brother said he had something hard to tell me, he had spoken to my father who had \u2018broken down in tears\u2019 that he has tried endlessly to repair his relationship with me, but nothing he can do is good enough. Apparently turning up to Pride, saying hello and immediately leaving was his way of accepting me and trying to have a relationship with me.\n\nI don\u2019t believe it. I am not open to the idea that he has changed because he is still an emotionally abusive and manipulative POS to my mum. He has also never said anything to me at all that would even hint he was trying to make amends, including on the day of Pride.\n\nWhen I told my mum about this, she said she didn\u2019t know he was upset but mentioned that a few years ago, I was getting married (but broke up beforehand) and he wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding. When they had a fight, she said something along the lines of \u2018there\u2019s no wonder Icidahob doesn\u2019t want you at his wedding or in his life\u2019 and he got the most upset she\u2019d seen him in years.\n\nMy brother said it\u2019s on me to reach out and begin to heal the relationship, I flat out said no. He was outraged, and said I was an AH for not caring. But I don\u2019t care, I simply don\u2019t, I\u2019ve had therapy for years and accepted that I don\u2019t have a father in my life. \n\nSome childhood friends agree with my brother, because whenever they\u2019ve met my father he\u2019s been polite, never seeing what happened behind closed doors. Some of my gay friends said they\u2019d love to be able to mend relationships with their fathers and I\u2019m lucky. \n\nSo, AITA for not doing anything with my father\u2019s pathetic \u2018gesture\u2019?", "created_utc": 1685713971, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ydfyw/aita_for_not_accepting_my_fathers_gesture_of/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was truly a pathetic gesture, it\u2019s completely up to you whether or not you want him in your life.", "NTA. Showing up to pick up your mother is not a gesture of reconciliation - and neither is using your brother to guilt you to accepting it. A gesture would be him coming to you and asking what he could do to heal the relationship. Also, a direct, explicit apology would not be a bad first step. \n\nHim just showing up to pick up your mother, breaking down in tears at home, and letting your brother call you about is is about the most passive aggressive way of trying to reconcile that I have ever heard.", "NTA. You know who your father really is, and you do not have to let him into your life to appease others.", "Idk why ppl always put the onus on the aggrieved to be the bigger person. It\u2019s never get the person to\nTake responsibility for their actions. \nGranted for OPs third person reports he does seem like he regrets his actions. There is however no evidence that he has made any changes or tried to do anything to change the status of his currently relationship with OP.\nIf he wants to mend the relationship then maybe he should ask the OP to talk to him or find out what he needs to change for him to get to that point. Doing what you think is some sort of gesture and hoping that OP will see it as this grand thing and getting disappointed when OP doesn\u2019t is kinda childish tbh. \nThe dad needs to realize that forgiveness is not about him it\u2019s about OP.", "NTA. It\u2019s never the job of the child to reach out to the parent to mend relationships", "NTA, he sucks and it sounds like he hasn't done any real work on himself. If he really wanted to reconnect, he'd make material and concrete steps to improve his behavior. He should go to therapy, and demonstrate he no longer holds those views, and the best way to do so is in service to the communities that he so loathed. Work with LGBT+ orgs, women's shelters, immigrant help centers etc. Probably most of all, treat your mother better and with respect. And all of that should be done, not with the goal of talking to you, but to truly be a better person.\n\nIf and when those conditions are met, and genuine contrition for his actions are demonstrated, then you can let him into you life on your own discretion.\n\nToo often misdeeds are rugswept in the name of \"politeness\" \"family\" \"keeping the peace\" and it's just a shitty spackle job on the gaping hole in the wall.", "NTA in any way, shape or form. Maybe your dad does want to repair your relationship, but his attempts have been pathetic at best. If you ever do feel like you should at least give it the old college try, then you should be clear with him (and your brother and mother) at what exactly you are looking for when it comes to the changed behavior, apologies, and support you expect from him. Showing up to pick up your mom from the parade may have felt like a huge step to him, but it\u2019s a far cry from actually making an effort to show YOU the support a true father should. You are NOT required to give him anymore chances at a relationship, but if you feel so led, make it very clear to him that the absolute bare minimum will never be good enough and tell him what ACTUAL effort would look like.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him anything, it\u2019s up to you to decide whether you\u2019re willing to let him back into your life or not. If, as you say, he half-assed an attempt to rebuild that bridge I wouldn\u2019t blame you for rejecting it.", "NTA.

During this short time, he was polite towards you.\n\nI don't see any attempt at reconciliation on his part here? Does showing up to collect his wife and saying hello to you count as \"trying endlessly\" to reconcile?\n\nIt seems like your father has embellished the truth. If not, outright lied to your brother about his attempts to reconnect with you.\n\nThis behaviour wouldn't be out of character for him, based on what you've told us of the man.\n\nTo me, it seems like he wants to be in your life, just not enough to actually change the behaviour that alienated him from you in the first place.", "NTA. Not one bit. \n\nYou do not owe your father ANYTHING. He is a grown man who can very definitely give you a call or drop a message asking to talk. And it will be your decision if you want to, just because he tries once does not mean he\u2019s changed, i totally get it OP. He is grieving the loss of a son and is probably realising at the age he is, that he\u2019s made some mistakes. \n\nI am happy to know you have a good relationship with your mum. Your brother and those childhood friends do not what you have been through, they have not felt the years of countless abuse that you have. OP, in no way should you have to reach out first, you said you\u2019ve moved on then continue on, if you do not feel like you want to rekindle or attempt to have a relationship with your father then do not.", "NTA.  The bar is set low for your dad.", "NTA", "Im generally of the belief we need to allow horrible people take a step to being better. That being said you owe no forgiveness to your father or brother. You require no explanation for how you feel towards them.\n\nNTA", "NAH, it is your prerogative to make a decision on how to approach him, but it was likely a massive step to your father to show up to a pride event, even if it seems trivial to you.", "NTA!\nI do know that people can change. But if he really wanted to, he wouldn\u2019t be doing a subtle show up to pick up his wife thinking that that support. Maybe that\u2019s the only way he knows how. But it\u2019s not your job to fix him!", "NTA. Your friends and brother suck. I hate when people excuse abuse and trauma when it hasn\u2019t happened to them. You don\u2019t need them and certainly don\u2019t need your father. I\u2019m proud of you OP for moving forward in your life, going to therapy, processing. My dad is the same way and it\u2019s extremely hard to go through that all and get out on the other side okay!! I wish you luck and happiness and that means you don\u2019t have to have your dad there and that\u2019s okay!", "NTA, but please at least consider that your dad is trying in his own way to have a relationship with you. You mentioned your surprise at him even showing up to Pride, but then he just said hi and left. While it was a pathetic gesture to you, as you said before, it was way out of character for him to even show up to pick up your mom, so maybe that's something? If your brother is being honest, it sounds like your dad may be having regrets, but has no idea how to go about talking to you about it and thought that showing up at Pride for a minute would be a good start. Having said all this, it's completely up to you how you want to handle this, but again, NTA.", "NTA. I have had a parent come back into my life or \"Make an effort\" now that I'm older and as far as I'm concerned its too little too late. you don't need to subject yourself to somebody just because they are family. if you don't want to forgive him and don't what him around or even present more than he is thats totally up to you. you don't owe anybody an explanation.", "It sounds like your dad really was making an effort. I get that bad childhoods are rough, and you\u2019re the only one who gets to decide if you have a relationship. BUT if he\u2019s as awful as you say and took this tiny step of being near Pride, it really does sound like he is trying. \n\nNAH.", "NAH\n\nYou don't have to do anything to work on the relationship.  \n\nThird party opinions don't matter.  \n\nBut Dad isn't the asshole in this one situation.  He hasn't said anything to you.", "YTA, big time.\n\nYou\u2019ve essentially made him your whipping post for your own self righteousness, and since he can\u2019t change or you\u2019d lose that, you refuse to allow him to make any gestures, make any steps in the right direction. That\u2019s not what a good person does. A good person is open to growth and change in another, and welcomes positive steps. \n\nYou\u2019ve painted dad into a corner, refuse to let him out of the corner, and then blame him for being in the corner. Who\u2019s to blame there, the person in the corner, or the person holding the paint can?", "You don't seem to have anything in mind that he could possibly do that you would accept: you are \"not open to the idea\", you \"don't have a father\".\n\nYou have no good words to say for him. The words you have are angry and bitter. You seem to feel hurt. \n\nThe ball is in your court. You don't have to do anything with it. Parents are imperfect and, being people of their times, usually do what they know how. Consider that it will have cost him something to reach out by coming to Pride.\n\nIf you are 100% certain that you never want to see or speak with him again, that's OK. From the POV of a random Redditor who knows neither of you, it seems like a loss.", ">I\u2019ve had therapy for years and accepted that I don\u2019t have a father in my life.\n\nIf you don't care, then why are you here asking about the situation? Why do you continue to discuss it with your brother/mother at all? You've resolved the relationship already.", "YTA", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They will always hold the expectation that it's the other person who needs to change and that if they don't then they're the one's not putting in the effort to repair things.
