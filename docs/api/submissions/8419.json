This sounds like it is a person desperate for attention latching into a reason to get more attention.  Expecting that people who you haven\u2019t seen in years of course follow you on social media is narcissistic.  I\u2019d say your only play is to ignore her and the situation.  Anything else gives this girl the attention that she was looking for and incentivizes the behavior", "NTA, you didn\u2019t know, sounds like an honest mistake.  \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that some people have moved to social media as their main source of communicating their life events to the world, and presume everyone else does the same.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t know, it\u2019s an honest thing to do. If you\u2019d kept doing it after knowing that\u2019s a whole different issue, but you haven\u2019t.\n\nEqually I understand why she may be upset. Probably a message after a few days just saying sorry, you didn\u2019t know and now you do you\u2019ll make sure you use their new name should suffice.", "NTA: you didn't know. Now, if you keep calling her by her birth name, then YTA (but accidents happen, just say sorry and move on)\n\nThat being said, she seems to be a bit intense about this. I mean ffs the trans people I know don't get this upset over deadnaming... If it happens again and she gets this pissy about it (even after you apologize, explain it was an accident) just walk away. These people in my experience can't be reasoned with, and don't recognize the world doesn't revolve around them.", "NTA.\n\nThis also sounds like a lot of drama that the host could have helped everyone avoid. You didn't know that Irene changed her name and gets triggered by references to her old name or family.  Your host put the two of you together at a gathering without giving you a heads up. She owes you AND Irene an apology. \n\nIrene needs to work on her emotional regulation or move far away where there is little likelihood of being recognized by anyone she met in the first 20+ years of her life. Being reminded of difficult family issues can be traumatic, but it is the fault of the people who caused the family issues, not an old friend who's only offense was greeting you by name.", "NTA. \n\nCan't stand it when people come down on you for shit like this. If you continued to call her by the old name, then yes you'd be the AH. However, you didn't  know, and people shouldn't just expect you to.", "Nta imo. You didn't know and you apologized. Her getting annoyed might be due to some personal reasons but she has no right to lash out at you. \nIf she insists everyone on social media must know about her, then she must also know that you are not active there.", "NTA. You didn't know something you had no way of knowing. Pretty cheeky of Irene to assume someone she didn't see in eight years was reading each of her social media updates!", "NTA\n\n\nNever assume someone sees everything you post on sm. An apology like the host said is good but she accused you of intentionally trying to bring up her trauma with her birth name. I'd say that's an accusation worth defending against.", "NTA there is no way you could have known as you haven't seen her in years.  I fail to see what apology is necessary as you called her by the name you knew her by with no idea she changed it.  She corrected you and you started calling her by her current name.  Yet another person just looking for a reason to be offended and upset over nothing.", "NTA. You are not a mind reader and did not know.", "NTA, sounds like the drama llama came for a visit!  Expecting you to have seen her social media announcements is laughable, and anyone acting like you did her wrong by not knowing is not your friend and enabling this person to victimize you for her own self aggrandizement.", "NTA. Irene is being a drama llama. It was an honest mistake.", "NTA - it's on Shireen to make sure everyone gets the memo and accept that she may fail in some cases.  It's not like this is printed in the Federal Register.", "NTA\n\nJust apologize for the mistake and call her Irene next time. You know it's a minor one, she perceives it as major, it sucks but that's just how it goes.", "NTA at all", "NTA. You had no idea about the name change, and it was an honest mistake. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes and she needs to calm down and understand that it was an accident.", "NTA. I really think you should always support people who may be transitioning, I'll use the new name, I'll use the right pronouns... But you can't expect people to guess and people to have seen a social media post you posted years ago. You couldn't know, I would just apologize lightly \"Oh sorry I didn't know\", but I would definitely expect that to be enough.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't do anything out of bad faith.\n\nNTA unless you're leaving something out. I don't think that an apology was even warranted at all but I would have probably given a \"oh got it\" and moved on with the new name without thinking twice.", "NTA. She's ridiculous... people can't expect that everyone on their friends list sees EVERYTHING they post. She needs to grow up", "NTA. You didn't know, you apologized when you were corrected. This person way overreacted. People don't get to be assholes just because they've suffered trauma.", "NTA you didn't know. Not sure why you were expected to know from an online post you didn't see. Are you supposed to check everyone's social media's now to get up to date with their life and check everyone's name is still the same? Why tf would you have assumed her name changed!", "NTA\n\nYou didn't know! It's not like she corrected you and then you repeatedly called her the old name again and again anyway. She can be hurt from it if she has a lot of trauma, sure. Trauma responses differ. But she has to be able to be logical enough to recognize that you don't use social media, didn't know about the name change, and apologized once you found out. It's not on you.", "NTA. There was no way for you to know. Actually, the party host should have mentioned it to you if they knew who was going to be there.", "NTA. I don't understand why people that use social media and to excess in most cases thinks everyone else is the same. Some people choose to do things other than read the endless, useless posts of others.", "I think probably YTA.\n\nJust because you didn\u2019t know about her name doesn\u2019t mean that you couldn\u2019t offer a sincere apology without being defensive about what you did or didn\u2019t know.  This is speculation, but I agree with your friend that the apology you offered was probably more like \u201csorry for hurting your feelings but it\u2019s not my fault\u201d, which would be kind of a non-apology.", "INFO: Did you apologise, or did you 'try' to apologise by justifying your mistake? These are two different things.", "INFO: Was the host aware you apologized? \n\nI'm leaning towards N-T-A but I'm curious about the \"unqualified apology\" comment?", "INFO:   \nThis all depends on how you spoke to Irene.
