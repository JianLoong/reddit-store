This sounds like it is a person desperate for attention latching into a reason to get more attention.  Expecting that people who you haven\u2019t seen in years of course follow you on social media is narcissistic.  I\u2019d say your only play is to ignore her and the situation.  Anything else gives this girl the attention that she was looking for and incentivizes the behavior", "NTA, you didn\u2019t know, sounds like an honest mistake.  \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that some people have moved to social media as their main source of communicating their life events to the world, and presume everyone else does the same.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t know, it\u2019s an honest thing to do. If you\u2019d kept doing it after knowing that\u2019s a whole different issue, but you haven\u2019t.\n\nEqually I understand why she may be upset. Probably a message after a few days just saying sorry, you didn\u2019t know and now you do you\u2019ll make sure you use their new name should suffice.", "NTA: you didn't know. Now, if you keep calling her by her birth name, then YTA (but accidents happen, just say sorry and move on)\n\nThat being said, she seems to be a bit intense about this. I mean ffs the trans people I know don't get this upset over deadnaming... If it happens again and she gets this pissy about it (even after you apologize, explain it was an accident) just walk away. These people in my experience can't be reasoned with, and don't recognize the world doesn't revolve around them.", "NTA.\n\nThis also sounds like a lot of drama that the host could have helped everyone avoid. You didn't know that Irene changed her name and gets triggered by references to her old name or family.  Your host put the two of you together at a gathering without giving you a heads up. She owes you AND Irene an apology. \n\nIrene needs to work on her emotional regulation or move far away where there is little likelihood of being recognized by anyone she met in the first 20+ years of her life.

You didn't know something you had no way of knowing. Pretty cheeky of Irene to assume someone she didn't see in eight years was reading each of her social media updates!", "NTA\n\n\nNever assume someone sees everything you post on sm.

Irene is being a drama llama. It was an honest mistake.", "NTA - it's on Shireen to make sure everyone gets the memo and accept that she may fail in some cases.

Some of them have even flat out told me they refuse to call me by my \u201cnew\u201d name. It was very shocking & upsetting for me, because it felt incredibly disrespectful.
