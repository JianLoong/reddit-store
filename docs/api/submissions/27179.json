He got a great job opportunity after college so he moved down. Two years ago he got married to Jenny and what I heard it was a beautiful wedding. So the whole issue started when we were trying to get there. The wedding was on Saturday and our plane left Thursday night. Well it got delayed and then delayed about four more times ( Friday morning at this point) and then all the plane got canceled due to a storm.\n\nWhen that happened it was clear we were not leaving and driving there would take too long and we would still miss the ceremony. So we informed him and he was pissed. We sent our well wishes and we could FaceTime in if he wanted. He told us no and we saw a video of his getting married.\n\nNow the present day issue any times we get an argument or he wants us to do something he pulls up we missed his wedding card. We were taking over the phone we were talking about hosting thanksgiving this year. He got mad saying why won\u2019t you visit us and I told him we don\u2019t have the money for the trip and we just saw him in July (since it was unclear, yes we visited him and went to him, more detail in a comment)\n\nWe got in a argument and he pulled the you missed our wedding it\u2019s the least you can do. I told him enough and that he needs to get over it. He called me a jerk. My daughter learned about it as she is on our side but I don\u2019t know.\n\nEdit to make it clear in the July part. \n\nAlso because it has been asked a lot, yes we looked into other airports the planes were grounded also. We are from Maine and the storm was going though our state and then riding down the east coast. We weren\u2019t getting a flight and yes we looked. It basically blocked travel for two days. If we did go down a state or two we would be following the storm and we wouldn\u2019t get a flight", "created_utc": 1695128220, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mqaj5/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_needs_to_get_over_us/", "score": 4870, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn\u2019t just book one for the morning of the ceremony and hope for the best. I understand he\u2019s upset. But you don\u2019t control the weather or the airlines. What did he realistically expect you to do that you didn\u2019t? You missed it. It\u2019s done. You\u2019ve apologised.

I am saying that since the son is being unreasonable in blaming the parents for things that are out of thier control the parents could easily have made a similarly unreasonable statement of blame as a way to illustrate to thier son how useless and unfair such blame is.**", "I was about to say YTA, but once I read that you actually tried everything to get there, I say NTA.

I\u2019m sure you were just as upset as he was that you missed his wedding, but there\u2019s nothing that could have been done about it, so it needs to be dropped. Things like this happens sometimes, through no fault of anyone involved, and it shouldn\u2019t be a point of contention. My own father missed my birth because he was across the country and I came six weeks early. Sucked for him, sucked for my mom. There was nothing anyone could do about it.

There was literally nothing you could've done in that situation.", "I'm struck by a grown married son, living away from his parents, regularly getting into arguments with those parents.

On its face it seems like son is over reacting but, at least with my family, the fight is never really about what it looks like it\u2019s about. There\u2019s almost always underlying issues. Or it could be son is just unforgiving and is holding a childish grudge.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks that you missed the wedding but that was outside your control. You can't change the weather or the past. At this point, he really has no choice but to get over it.", "NTA. It sounds like you considered other possible plans when your flights were cancelled. Is there something else going on in your relationship with him? It's completely unreasonable that he's holding a grudge against you for the weather, which is out of your control.", "NTA.\n\nYou intended to be there a whole day in advance, in time I assume for the rehearsal dinner.  Nothing wrong with your plan. Flights were canceled due to a storm.  They call that an Act of God when it comes to contracts.  ALL OF YOU missed you being at the wedding--you were as much a victim of circumstance as they were. \n\nHe does, indeed, need to \"get over it.\"   A part of me wonders if this is Jenny talking though, assuming she doesn't have roots in your area.", "NTA those factors were completely out of your control, it's not like you had a flight the morning of the wedding woke up late and missed the flight. You were booked to travel a few days before.\n\nCould you have thought ok getting a bit nervous maybe we should drive, yes, but I don't know how long that journey would have been and if you're healthy enough for that type of trip.", "NTA. Not your fault. Your son is being immature.", "NTA. Your son is behaving like a child. You can't control your flight being delayed and then altogether canceled. It's understandable why he's upset, but he really needs to grow up and learn to move on. It's not your fault.", "NTA.\n\nif any of the ordeal was because of your fault, then I would understand him, but pulling off his wedding when you did your best to attend, and defenitly didn't plan to miss it is an AH from his side.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you did all you could. It\u2019s terrible that you missed his wedding and I feel for all of you, but that was nobody\u2019s fault and he needs to accept that and not use that as a weapon.", "NTA. You missed his wedding for reasons beyond your control, and he is being incredibly immature by continuing to bring it up.", "NTA because these truly were difficult circumstances. You planned to leave days before, so it's not like you left it until the last minute or even the day before. The drive there was 37 hours and not safe anyway because of the storm that canceled the flights. This is a crappy situation, but no one is really at fault. I understand him being sad, but you didn't miss it willingly. It's wrong of him to complain about not visiting when you were there months ago, don't have the money to fly again, and he's choosing not to visit you guys instead.", "NTA - missing the wedding was not your fault, unless you are capable of controlling weather (which would be a cool power to have tbh). It's ridiculous that he's holding that against you. Maybe once he cools down you can have a discussion about it, that while it's understandable that he was disappointed that his parents couldn't make it to the wedding, the circumstances were beyond your control and you find it hurtful that he uses that against you in stressful situations. \n\nI'm a little curious about what your relationship with him is like outside of this one argument, like whether he is usually a petty person or is there something else going on that's making him act this way.", "NTA - you didn't chose to miss it - you had no way of getting there", "INFO -\n\nHave you visited him since the wedding?", "NTA you tried to go to the wedding.

He does need to get over it and let it go. He shouldn\u2019t be bringing it up all the time. \n\nBut you also seemed very dismissive of missing his wedding and the feelings that evoked.

Friday morning you should have gotten in the car & started driving when the flight was canceled. That was 24 hours prior to the wedding. The fact you didn\u2019t even try to get there for the reception kinda makes you an AH. \n\nEven putting that in the past, your son wants to spend time with you & you are blowing him off.

Presumably you aren't in any of the wedding pictures or anything, which is a bummer for him. It sounds like he is unhappy in his location and wants more support from you. The fact that he lives near his wife's family, but doesn't like them, is problematic, as he spends a lot more time with them than with his own support system.\n\nI'll also say (assuming you are in the USA) that in my experience, people who grew up on the east coast and those who grew up on the west, have different cultures and find it difficult to live on the opposite side of the country than where they grew up. I'm an East Coaster who has visited the West Coast and I can understand that feeling of things feeling out of place. Likewise, I've known West Coasters who had to move East for work, and they ALWAYS missed the west coast and eventually went back West. \n\nIn this situation, even though you were not at fault for missing the wedding, I would use any complaints he makes as a way to get to the deeper issue of him taking the steps he needs to take to be happy. Has he mentioned his unhappiness to his wife. What was her take on it. Was she open to changing things, maybe moving somewhere he'd be happy, looking for new jobs, etc. Also, do they spend too much time with her family and is she willing to reduce that time, or does her family's wishes take precedence over his, leading him to feel lonely and minimized in his own life.

To have to take off work for several days and potentially spend money we didn't have on top of that could have been financially crippling at the time.\n\nPeople have every right to choose to have an out of town or destination wedding.  But they have no right to be upset if and when people don't attend, for whatever reason.

Were you privileged enough that your parents were smart enough to check the weather so they ensured that they made it to one of the biggest days of your life? I truly hope so. But your son didn\u2019t have that. Instead he has parents that tell him that they\u2019re not going to make it and they\u2019re not going to try. They\u2019re going to sit around and hope the weather clears instead of being smart enough to drive inland away from the storm and hop a plane. He has parents that just gave up instead of even showing up late and still showing support. Showing that he\u2019s not just an inconvenient afterthought and probably getting a disingenuous apology because they can\u2019t control the weather. Try empathy so one day you might understand how much your absence and gaslighting about it hurts him. And I hope your daughter doesn\u2019t have to suffer the same outcome. If she\u2019s already married, she should try empathy too because you probably showed up to hers. And maybe ask him what he needs from his parents to try heal this wound. If he\u2019s still bringing it up, it still hurts. Abandonment wounds cut deep, especially when the people that hurt you are supposed to be the ones the love you the most. His parents abandoned him on what was supposed to be one of his happiest days. So he had to hide his pain and disappointment while working to put his joy overtop. So potentially while his wife had her father/daughter dance, he stood alone or had to tell everyone that his parents couldn\u2019t make it. I hope he danced with his mother in law or another kind woman so he didn\u2019t miss out. So he could feel loved too. YTA.

Let everyone get their feelings/thoughts about the incident out during that session.  Also, actually validate and discuss everyone\u2019s feelings/thoughts on this - don\u2019t just focus on your own perspective.  \n\nFor example, your son may think that, with the technology available (such as apps/websites that predict the weather), you could have realized that a storm was coming when you were to fly and gotten an earlier flight (for a day or two before you were originally planning to fly out).
