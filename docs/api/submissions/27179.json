Well it got delayed and then delayed about four more times ( Friday morning at this point) and then all the plane got canceled due to a storm.\n\nWhen that happened it was clear we were not leaving and driving there would take too long and we would still miss the ceremony. So we informed him and he was pissed. We sent our well wishes and we could FaceTime in if he wanted. He told us no and we saw a video of his getting married.\n\nNow the present day issue any times we get an argument or he wants us to do something he pulls up we missed his wedding card. We were taking over the phone we were talking about hosting thanksgiving this year. He got mad saying why won\u2019t you visit us and I told him we don\u2019t have the money for the trip and we just saw him in July. We got in a argument and he pulled the you missed our wedding it\u2019s the least you can do. I told him enough and that he needs to get over it. He called me a jerk.

Things like this happens sometimes, through no fault of anyone involved, and it shouldn\u2019t be a point of contention. My own father missed my birth because he was across the country and I came six weeks early. Sucked for him, sucked for my mom. There was nothing anyone could do about it.

On its face it seems like son is over reacting but, at least with my family, the fight is never really about what it looks like it\u2019s about. There\u2019s almost always underlying issues.

Nothing wrong with your plan. Flights were canceled due to a storm.  They call that an Act of God when it comes to contracts.

Not your fault. Your son is being immature.", "NTA. Your son is behaving like a child. You can't control your flight being delayed and then altogether canceled. It's understandable why he's upset, but he really needs to grow up and learn to move on. It's not your fault.", "NTA.\n\nif any of the ordeal was because of your fault, then I would understand him, but pulling off his wedding when you did your best to attend, and defenitly didn't plan to miss it is an AH from his side.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you did all you could.

You missed his wedding for reasons beyond your control, and he is being incredibly immature by continuing to bring it up.", "NTA because these truly were difficult circumstances. You planned to leave days before, so it's not like you left it until the last minute or even the day before. The drive there was 37 hours and not safe anyway because of the storm that canceled the flights. This is a crappy situation, but no one is really at fault. I understand him being sad, but you didn't miss it willingly. It's wrong of him to complain about not visiting when you were there months ago, don't have the money to fly again, and he's choosing not to visit you guys instead.", "NTA - missing the wedding was not your fault, unless you are capable of controlling weather (which would be a cool power to have tbh). It's ridiculous that he's holding that against you. Maybe once he cools down you can have a discussion about it, that while it's understandable that he was disappointed that his parents couldn't make it to the wedding, the circumstances were beyond your control and you find it hurtful that he uses that against you in stressful situations. \n\nI'm a little curious about what your relationship with him is like outside of this one argument, like whether he is usually a petty person or is there something else going on that's making him act this way.", "NTA - you didn't chose to miss it - you had no way of getting there", "INFO -\n\nHave you visited him since the wedding?", "NTA you tried to go to the wedding.
