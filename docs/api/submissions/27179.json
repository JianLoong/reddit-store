He got a great job opportunity after college so he moved down. Two years ago he got married to Jenny and what I heard it was a beautiful wedding. So the whole issue started when we were trying to get there. The wedding was on Saturday and our plane left Thursday night. Well it got delayed and then delayed about four more times ( Friday morning at this point) and then all the plane got canceled due to a storm.\n\nWhen that happened it was clear we were not leaving and driving there would take too long and we would still miss the ceremony. So we informed him and he was pissed. We sent our well wishes and we could FaceTime in if he wanted. He told us no and we saw a video of his getting married.\n\nNow the present day issue any times we get an argument or he wants us to do something he pulls up we missed his wedding card. We were taking over the phone we were talking about hosting thanksgiving this year. He got mad saying why won\u2019t you visit us and I told him we don\u2019t have the money for the trip and we just saw him in July (since it was unclear, yes we visited him and went to him, more detail in a comment)\n\nWe got in a argument and he pulled the you missed our wedding it\u2019s the least you can do. I told him enough and that he needs to get over it. He called me a jerk. My daughter learned about it as she is on our side but I don\u2019t know.\n\nEdit to make it clear in the July part. \n\nAlso because it has been asked a lot, yes we looked into other airports the planes were grounded also. We are from Maine and the storm was going though our state and then riding down the east coast. We weren\u2019t getting a flight and yes we looked. It basically blocked travel for two days. If we did go down a state or two we would be following the storm and we wouldn\u2019t get a flight", "created_utc": 1695128220, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mqaj5/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_needs_to_get_over_us/", "score": 8362, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn\u2019t just book one for the morning of the ceremony and hope for the best. I understand he\u2019s upset. But you don\u2019t control the weather or the airlines. What did he realistically expect you to do that you didn\u2019t? You missed it. It\u2019s done. You\u2019ve apologised.

I am saying that since the son is being unreasonable in blaming the parents for things that are out of thier control the parents could easily have made a similarly unreasonable statement of blame as a way to illustrate to thier son how useless and unfair such blame is.**", "I was about to say YTA, but once I read that you actually tried everything to get there, I say NTA.

I\u2019m sure you were just as upset as he was that you missed his wedding, but there\u2019s nothing that could have been done about it, so it needs to be dropped. Things like this happens sometimes, through no fault of anyone involved, and it shouldn\u2019t be a point of contention. My own father missed my birth because he was across the country and I came six weeks early. Sucked for him, sucked for my mom. There was nothing anyone could do about it.

There was literally nothing you could've done in that situation.", "I'm struck by a grown married son, living away from his parents, regularly getting into arguments with those parents.

On its face it seems like son is over reacting but, at least with my family, the fight is never really about what it looks like it\u2019s about. There\u2019s almost always underlying issues. Or it could be son is just unforgiving and is holding a childish grudge.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks that you missed the wedding but that was outside your control. You can't change the weather or the past. At this point, he really has no choice but to get over it.", "NTA. It sounds like you considered other possible plans when your flights were cancelled. Is there something else going on in your relationship with him? It's completely unreasonable that he's holding a grudge against you for the weather, which is out of your control.", "NTA.\n\nYou intended to be there a whole day in advance, in time I assume for the rehearsal dinner.  Nothing wrong with your plan. Flights were canceled due to a storm.  They call that an Act of God when it comes to contracts.  ALL OF YOU missed you being at the wedding--you were as much a victim of circumstance as they were. \n\nHe does, indeed, need to \"get over it.\"   A part of me wonders if this is Jenny talking though, assuming she doesn't have roots in your area.", "NTA those factors were completely out of your control, it's not like you had a flight the morning of the wedding woke up late and missed the flight. You were booked to travel a few days before.\n\nCould you have thought ok getting a bit nervous maybe we should drive, yes, but I don't know how long that journey would have been and if you're healthy enough for that type of trip.", "NTA. Not your fault. Your son is being immature.", "NTA. Your son is behaving like a child. You can't control your flight being delayed and then altogether canceled. It's understandable why he's upset, but he really needs to grow up and learn to move on. It's not your fault.", "NTA.\n\nif any of the ordeal was because of your fault, then I would understand him, but pulling off his wedding when you did your best to attend, and defenitly didn't plan to miss it is an AH from his side.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you did all you could. It\u2019s terrible that you missed his wedding and I feel for all of you, but that was nobody\u2019s fault and he needs to accept that and not use that as a weapon.", "NTA. You missed his wedding for reasons beyond your control, and he is being incredibly immature by continuing to bring it up.", "NTA because these truly were difficult circumstances. You planned to leave days before, so it's not like you left it until the last minute or even the day before. The drive there was 37 hours and not safe anyway because of the storm that canceled the flights. This is a crappy situation, but no one is really at fault. I understand him being sad, but you didn't miss it willingly. It's wrong of him to complain about not visiting when you were there months ago, don't have the money to fly again, and he's choosing not to visit you guys instead.", "NTA - missing the wedding was not your fault, unless you are capable of controlling weather (which would be a cool power to have tbh). It's ridiculous that he's holding that against you. Maybe once he cools down you can have a discussion about it, that while it's understandable that he was disappointed that his parents couldn't make it to the wedding, the circumstances were beyond your control and you find it hurtful that he uses that against you in stressful situations. \n\nI'm a little curious about what your relationship with him is like outside of this one argument, like whether he is usually a petty person or is there something else going on that's making him act this way.", "NTA - you didn't chose to miss it - you had no way of getting there", "INFO -\n\nHave you visited him since the wedding?", "NTA you tried to go to the wedding.

He does need to get over it and let it go. He shouldn\u2019t be bringing it up all the time. \n\nBut you also seemed very dismissive of missing his wedding and the feelings that evoked.

Friday morning you should have gotten in the car & started driving when the flight was canceled. That was 24 hours prior to the wedding. The fact you didn\u2019t even try to get there for the reception kinda makes you an AH. \n\nEven putting that in the past, your son wants to spend time with you & you are blowing him off.

Presumably you aren't in any of the wedding pictures or anything, which is a bummer for him. It sounds like he is unhappy in his location and wants more support from you. The fact that he lives near his wife's family, but doesn't like them, is problematic, as he spends a lot more time with them than with his own support system.\n\nI'll also say (assuming you are in the USA) that in my experience, people who grew up on the east coast and those who grew up on the west, have different cultures and find it difficult to live on the opposite side of the country than where they grew up. I'm an East Coaster who has visited the West Coast and I can understand that feeling of things feeling out of place. Likewise, I've known West Coasters who had to move East for work, and they ALWAYS missed the west coast and eventually went back West. \n\nIn this situation, even though you were not at fault for missing the wedding, I would use any complaints he makes as a way to get to the deeper issue of him taking the steps he needs to take to be happy. Has he mentioned his unhappiness to his wife. What was her take on it. Was she open to changing things, maybe moving somewhere he'd be happy, looking for new jobs, etc. Also, do they spend too much time with her family and is she willing to reduce that time, or does her family's wishes take precedence over his, leading him to feel lonely and minimized in his own life.

To have to take off work for several days and potentially spend money we didn't have on top of that could have been financially crippling at the time.\n\nPeople have every right to choose to have an out of town or destination wedding.  But they have no right to be upset if and when people don't attend, for whatever reason.

Were you privileged enough that your parents were smart enough to check the weather so they ensured that they made it to one of the biggest days of your life? I truly hope so. But your son didn\u2019t have that. Instead he has parents that tell him that they\u2019re not going to make it and they\u2019re not going to try. They\u2019re going to sit around and hope the weather clears instead of being smart enough to drive inland away from the storm and hop a plane. He has parents that just gave up instead of even showing up late and still showing support. Showing that he\u2019s not just an inconvenient afterthought and probably getting a disingenuous apology because they can\u2019t control the weather. Try empathy so one day you might understand how much your absence and gaslighting about it hurts him. And I hope your daughter doesn\u2019t have to suffer the same outcome. If she\u2019s already married, she should try empathy too because you probably showed up to hers. And maybe ask him what he needs from his parents to try heal this wound. If he\u2019s still bringing it up, it still hurts. Abandonment wounds cut deep, especially when the people that hurt you are supposed to be the ones the love you the most. His parents abandoned him on what was supposed to be one of his happiest days. So he had to hide his pain and disappointment while working to put his joy overtop. So potentially while his wife had her father/daughter dance, he stood alone or had to tell everyone that his parents couldn\u2019t make it. I hope he danced with his mother in law or another kind woman so he didn\u2019t miss out. So he could feel loved too. YTA.

That\u2019s valid! Did you support him, did you sit with him and talk about what it meant for you to not be there? You absolutely let him down, and it was 100% not your fault.

Let everyone get their feelings/thoughts about the incident out during that session.  Also, actually validate and discuss everyone\u2019s feelings/thoughts on this - don\u2019t just focus on your own perspective.  \n\nFor example, your son may think that, with the technology available (such as apps/websites that predict the weather), you could have realized that a storm was coming when you were to fly and gotten an earlier flight (for a day or two before you were originally planning to fly out).

But it just was not possible for you to be there, no matter how much either of you wanted to. A storm prevented you from going there. It wasn\u2019t your choice.

He is missing you and probably feels lonely on the other side of the country without his family. He probably wants you to be there all the time and gets both mad and sad and doesn\u2019t really know how to express himself and that\u2019s why he gets mad. \n\nIt sounds like there is not much you can really do about the whole situation. If you don\u2019t have enough money to visit him as often as you\u2019d like, maybe you can ask him if he can pay for airplane tickets? \nAnd about the whole missing out on the wedding thing, I would sit him down and explain that you are very sorry and that you wish that there was something you could do so something about it but there just isn\u2019t.

I NEVER would have expected my parents to get to my wedding if A.) the weather was so bad they\u2019re grounding planes or B.) try to come anyway and driving 37 hours in dangerously bad weather. I could never forgive myself if something bad happened to them.\n\nYes, I\u2019d have been disappointed but to keep bringing it up years later? Why is he so butthurt over this? Is there more to this story?", "Maybethe groom\u2019s parents were employed full time and could not get additional time off. Maybe they thought arriving Thursday afternoon was sufficient time. That would have given them Thursday evening, all day and evening Friday, then Saturday. \n\nHonestly, OP is not the Great and Powerful Wizard. They had no idea the storm was 1. Going to be a thing when they first made their reservations, and 2. Was going to impact travel for two days. \n\nWas it unfortunate? Yes. Do the parents probably regret missing the wedding? I would think so.", "Everyone here in west virginia didn't even flinch because we are used to people forgetting we are a separate state lol", "I'm just saying traveling out a few days ahead of time is normal for parents. Your kid, hopefully, only gets married once. Furthermore, it would be super weird not to see parents there ahead of time, too. I'm just surprised OP doesn't seem to get that", "I\u2019m a believer in do-overs. I\u2019ve done a few over the years. Some people pivot in these situations and plan a little do-over with pictures and all. It\u2019s too bad that didn\u2019t happen then, but maybe a special family get together in the future with everyone dressed up and some nice pictures?\n\nThere seems to be nothing more OP could have done. It\u2019s not fair for this to be held up repeatedly by the son until forever. Maybe thoroughly acknowledging son\u2019s disappointment would help. A thoughtful listen; let him say what he wants, acknowledge the disappointment without explaining why trip couldn\u2019t happen (he knows), just let him fully express his feelings without input or justification on OP\u2019s part. It seems something needs to happen to begin to heal this situation\u2026", ">I would've still drove to at least have gotten to the reception and celebrate but that's just me.\n\nOP said their son moved  to \"the other side of the country from us\".  If that distance is north and south, that's a 24 hour drive in the best of conditions; if it's east coast and west coast, then it even longer.\n\nAdd in a snow storm and OP would not make it to any of the celebration in time, even if they only stopped for gas.\n\nOP's son needs to realize that just because his parents can't break the laws of physics doesn't mean his parents don't love him or didn't make a real effort to get to his wedding.\n\nOP is completely NTA, and should not have been expected to hop into a car to drive across the country in a snow storm.", "His sister is 7 years younger and still lives at home and while it's possible she's mid 20s it sounds more like she's still in school. That means he's not really THAT \"grown\", PLUS he married young PLUS he apparently \"hates his wife's family\" so he willingly walked into *that* as well. So is the immaturity he's exhibiting really that surprising?", "I can't help but feel like there's something missing. If not, I apologize to OP and this is a tough situation. Was the relationship good before the wedding?\n\nI know that personally I'd be devastated if my parents had missed my wedding. HOWEVER, I know that it would have taken an act of god to keep them away. In your case I'd qualify it as an act of god, and something's clearly amiss.", "Yup. My cousin had a pandemic wedding in 2020. None of the parents could attend in person. Only local family could be at their tiny outdoor wedding in person (the size and location was decided pre-pandemic). No one holds this against anyone. It worked out lovely for me because they live streamed the wedding and I wouldn't have gotten to take part otherwise. It was still a great wedding.", "The son hates his in-laws and keeps making excuses to fly back to his parents home and wants them to cough up the money for his flights according to OP.", "There is a difference between medically unavailable and being available and going to the wedding only a few days before.", "But couldn\u2019t you do like a 10 hour drive or 15 hour drive and fly from there?  I wouldn\u2019t  miss my kid\u2019s wedding. I\u2019d figure it out.", "Yeah, this frankly feels like a \u201cMissing Missing\u201d reason. OP\u2019s son seems to have gotten unusually angry given the situation and OP telling their kid they won\u2019t visit them makes me suspect that there is something missing from the post that is causing their son to react this way.", "I commented, I feel like OP is leaving out pertinent information and this feels more like a \u201cmissing missing reason\u201d.", "Yea, I saw that.  But doesnt really answer the questions.  If it was a hurricane or snowstorm, they would have had much more notice than 48 hours (on the east coast we heard about hurricane/TS lee potentially hitting last weekend more than a week before).  I ask where the wedding was because if it was in a major east coast city, its very possible to fly as close as possible and drive the rest of the way (so not 37 hours, maybe 6).  The last one just goes to why the son might be so pissed, as in, if others managed to make it despite this storm, then why couldnt the parents (and vice versa).\n\nIm not saying any of these answers would make them TA necessarily, but hard to judge between ESH and NAH without it.", "This sounds like a very depressing movie plot", "I wouldn't make my dad do a 37hr drive WITHOUT BREAKS either. I'm sorry but a break to swap drivers and go to the toilet and eat in the car, isn't enough for that long a journey.", "Not stupid airlines - you wouldn't be happy if they would do the flight despite the weather conditions and you would loose a lived one because of it.\n\nIt was an 'act of god's mother nature at work.\n And the son is a huge AH. If OP refused to make any effort to go to the wedding then maybe I would understand the reproach but as is? Heck no.", "And take other people with you. NTA", "Except it\u2019s not some random niece or nephew, it\u2019s their kid. Who lives 3,000 miles away, that I assume they don\u2019t see that much. I think they\u2019d want to see them before the wedding events start.", "Still a shit planner. Or do they not have airports in your country?", "Actually, it just sounds like a movie plot and you specifically are very depressed. This plot could easily be worked into a comedy, romance, thriller, blacksploitation, or any number of other types of flicks.", "I've done 20-hour through drives, but with a bunch of friends who could switch off driving\\awake and sleeping in the back (you ideally want someone awake the driver can talk to\\get navigation from as well), but 37 hours is nuts.\n\nIf it were just me and one other i'd probably consider that a 3-day trip, with roughly 12-hour days of driving. I'm willing to bet this drive-time estimate also doesnt include things like stops for gas\\food, so those days are probably more like 14 hours each. No way I could make that wedding in time.", "We\u2019ve traveled over major holidays a ton and haven\u2019t had problems. However if going for a holiday, best to not plan to arrive day before; give a little cushion just in case.", ">families: make your own thanksgiving or holidays. Flying around holidays is crazy busy, so pick a less busy time close to whatever holiday, to have a family trip with less headaches and \n\nThis. We celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day the week before or after so we aren't held hostage to crazy expensive 'set meals'.", "34 hours non-stop? F that, and really pretty damn dangerous non-stop - that's the reason truckers have driving time limits regulated.", "> I feel guilty if I order a pizza and it starts to storm.\n\nI use grocery delivery mainly due to health issues, but there are times I could probably trek to the store myself - but used delivery still because it does reserve my energy for other things I need to take care of.  Anyway - when it's rainy season, I legit make sure I don't order if it's going to rain. I'll check the weather app and plan around it. Same when ordering doordash, etc. If I really don't want to throw something together at home, or don't have anything easy - I'll take my PJ'd self to the nearest drive-thru. \n\nEven though I know people still drive and need to work, etc. - it still makes me feel less guilty than having them do it in bad weather that I would try to avoid myself.", "Also poor people on the road cause it's stressful and more dangerous also for innocent people.", "Top comment for sure \ud83d\ude02", "I was about to say \u201cthat can\u2019t be true!\u201d but you are absolutely spot on\u2026 Crescent City to San Diego is 15 hours.", "It's entirely reasonable to show up to a wedding 2 days early.", "Did this a couple of months ago when we lost power after a storm and the pizza place didn\u2019t i tipped $100 on a $20 dollar pizza order", "I was raised on stormy pizza w big tips", "Maine had a pretty similar climate to where I live in Canada. Im not really sure how to compares to Sweden. A lot of the time the problem with storms is that they cause white out conditions and can change really quickly, as well as extremely high winds. It\u2019s also very humid. The high winds combined with humidity can cause ice to accumulate pretty quickly on the runway and wings of the plane. \n\nOnce when I was going on a plane in the winter my plane had to get \u201cde-iced\u201d twice on the runway while we were waiting to take off, and the weather wasn\u2019t even that bad. \n\nStorms bad enough to cancel flights aren\u2019t a regular thing, but they do happen a couple times a year.", "Exactly, NTA.\n\nThe OP made a good faith attempt to attend the wedding. Weather happens and multi-day delays happen. A friend of mine missed an event this summer, because the flight was delayed 2 days or so and would've meant she got there way after.", "And neither is Mother Nature LOL", "More like mother nature isn't unfortunately at our beck and call. NTA op", "Exactly this. I live in Denver and my kids only got one \u201csnow day\u201d last year and it wasn\u2019t for snow. It was during the cold snap that crippled the airport. It was so cold that school busses wouldn\u2019t start and it also wasn\u2019t safe for kids to walk to school. Yeah it\u2019s Colorado, and we\u2019re used to winter, but we are not equipped for *that* kind of cold. We all hated it!", "Do you live in Washington too?", ">Ain't no prejudice like regional prejudice ;)\n\n\"I may be Southern, but at least I'm not from Alabama and/or Mississippi!\" - definitely said by me in my life.\n\nBut now I live in Florida so... \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "Definitely more to the story."]}
