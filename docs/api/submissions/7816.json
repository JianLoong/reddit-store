The food is more important than the family to you, if the food portion is what kept you from going. I don't know why she didn't make enough food, if it was a money, ability,  or time management thing or anything else, but it's pretty clear that to her the family is the point of the gathering, not the food. The food is just the tradition.\n \nMaybe next time handle things with any amount of tact, address things before they become a problem (as in you could have mentioned to her at any point before that she made nowhere near enough food and left everyone hungry, asked if she could make more next time, etc...), or consider sucking it up every once in a while when it's her turn if you can't bring yourself to bring the issue up tactfully.\n \nAt the very least, don't be aggressively bad mannered.", "INFO:  Why not eat most of a meal beforehand?

But I'm trying to find a solution for you.  If you take your lunch to work could you fix some extra to eat? You could eat on afternoon break or on the way to her house.   Even if you don't take your lunch can you take some to eat with you that day?", "NTA", "NTA, of course. It sounds like your cousin is inexperienced at cooking and/or hosting. So what if other family members pitched in and made it a semi-potluck (the ones who know what they're doing, have the time & money could bring some extra items so cousin would literally get the picture of what portions should look like)? Maybe just the next time she is scheduled to host. Then let her take over the time after that and see if she has it figured out.

She acts like she was starved, but eating a light dinner isn\u2019t the worst thing ever for an adult that is getting a free meal.

I'd think that the cousin probably thought that the OP was offended by something or that there was something significant that was wrong.

A bad host is a bad host. .. and this is a reoccurring event.. Guests.. regardless of family or not..should not leave your house after dinner hungry..", "YTA. Eat before and after you go if you need to. Cause I\u2019m guessing these dinners are more about getting the family together and family time then it is the actual food. Any holiday with food is about family time, not the food!", "YTA. theres a place in between saying nothing and ranting at her for being a terrible host. she\u2019s just starting, you could mention how the portions felt small to you and a few other people had mentioned feeling hungry afterwards.", "Intern? So you aren\u2019t even a beginning doctor yet.", "YTA for snapping, you could have just told her.", "YTA. If you're that hungry, eat something before and/or after you go. You're a guest in someone's home. You don't get to dictate your preferences beyond an actual health risk. Or even better, take a dish meant to be shared with everyone so you have that to fell back on. You have the right to refuse the invitation, but she's not to blame. You are.", "Could it just be that your cousin was not used to serving so many people at once (seeing how she just moved out I can imagine she had to adjust to cooking for herself, let alone others)?\n\nShe probably misscalculated and if anyone had told her in a respetful tone (maybe offered tips on how to prepare large meal portions) she would have been able to take that into consideration and adjust.\n\nYTA for snapping at her instead of explaining calmly that the portions were too small.", "It sounds like OP did want to seem ungrateful though.", "If she can\u2019t afford it, she doesn\u2019t need to host.", "In complete sincerity, why is this top? Nobody is obligated to accept an invitation to anything. I'm extremely confused by this.", "I don't get the feeling that she \"supports' her cousin but rather is maybe a bit envious.  No emotionally healthy person would lash out at someone they actually cared about like that.", "If you are be sute that money is not the issue, then she's failing at hosting by being either cheap, inciteful or purposefully apathetic. Everyone makes mistakes when hosting for the first time, but if she isn't willing to correct herself after feedback, then she is definitely wrong and you are totally NTA. If there's any advice to be given to you though, you could have been more gentler with letting her know, just to give her the beenfit of doubt the first time.", "I disagree. If you attend weekly dinners, then you would see how much other family members provide for dinner. \n\nAlso, if someone is being pushy for an answer, don't be surprised when they tell you the truth. \n\nNTA", "Not if she previously  had  eaten at other family  s home,  she saw the portion size there.", "She's not obligated to go, but this isn't just dinner, it's time to spend with family. She's basically saying that because the food is wack, there's no point in going, which tells everyone that she didn't actually care about being with them, it was only about the food. It's not like her sister said she wasn't going either, just that she agreed the portion was tiny. \n\nI agree, YTA OP. Spend time with your family and eat at home like you already said you do.", "Are the other guests pouting and refusing to go back?  Sounds like this is way more than just your obsession with giant portions.  Put a protein bar in your purse or some packaged peanut butter crackers and eat in enroute.  Apologize to your cousin and tell her you were just \"hangry\" and offer to bring some sort of nonperishable side dish to the next dinner.", "Once in a blue moon implies random accraunce this doesn't seem random because they all share so I cyclic and reoccurring.", "What do you serve when you host?", "So you do care more about the fre food than seeing your family? Your cousin was 100% right about that?", "I mean, when you consider that this is a once a week gathering that cycles through a pool of potential hosts, I would say that \"once in a blue moon\" is actually a decent metaphor here. Blue moons aren't exactly random, they're just not something that constantly happens.", "The idiom means a rare accorance, blue moons themselves are not as a rare as the saying implies but this situation is recurring since they cycle through the family.\n\n I wonder how many people they cycle through for it to be a big enough issue for OP to get a snack before they go yano, like if they have 3 family members that's once a month if it's 10 that's like once every 2.5 so I guess it depends how big or little the family is.", "Gender has nothing to do with it, you're just looking for excuses to explain that you're very self centered and greedy. Either you care about seeing your family or you're just there to shove heaping mounds of free food into your face. You could easily eat before if you're really so hungry that one supper isn't enough for you.", "How often do you host?"]}
