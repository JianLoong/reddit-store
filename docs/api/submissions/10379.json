They like to jump from a few different bars. We text sporadically but I trust her to be safe. She told me at one point she felt she was too drunk to drive and was going to leave her car there. We both have each others location on, so I looked at her location, made a note of it--it was 12 minutes from the house, no biggie. This is an important note and I have thought this in my head but never shared it with her but my wife generally does not tell me: \"We're going from this bar to this one,\" which I like for no other reason than being cognizant of it and knowing where she is at a given time.\n\nShe rode with a friend to the next bar and then had me come get her. She had work early in the morning so I took her home, helped her get in bed and then called an Uber to take me down the road to pick up her car. It was almost on empty so I stopped and filled it up and drove it home.\n\nNext morning she woke me up and said: \"We need to go get my car so I can go to work.\"\n\nI told her I had already went and got it and fueled it up so she was ready to go. She was pleasantly surprised and said: \"How did you know what bar it was at?\"  \n\n\nI told her: \"Well, when you said you were too drunk to drive I looked at your location and made a note of it. (THIS IS WHERE I THINK I MIGHT BE THE ASSHOLE) But to be honest, I wish I didn't have to do that. I wish you would let me know where you're going to be at just so I know in case anything happens to you. **Sometimes you don't do a great job at keeping me in the loop**.\"\n\nHer immediate retort is the character flaw. It doesn't just pop up when she goes out with a friend, it pops up often.

She does not have a responsibility to tell you about each bar or friend's house that they visit on a night out.  She is not a minor child.

From your other comments I think you need to take into perspective the scale of things you want filled in on vs. the scale of things that actually need communicating.\n\nYou keep bringing up a week-long business trip as an example, and wouldn't it be unfair if you didn't tell your wife about that - but being gone for a week is a much larger event than being gone for a couple hours at a bar or at the grocery store. It's the same idea as why a lot of couples will have a price point of purchases past which they will discuss things with each other - they will set a budget and decide to discuss purchases above $500 in advance, say, but they don't feel the need to talk about it when they're going to buy a bag of chips or a coffee. Or why it's totally fine to not fill your partner in on small details of work drama, but it would be weird to not tell your partner about major promotions or a job change or whatever.\n\nYour wife doesn't need to fill you in on every last detail of where she is, constantly, and if that makes you anxious that's a you problem that needs therapy.

I legit text my boyfriend when I go anywhere cuz I know he likes to hear about my plans and what I'm up to. I never have to tell him..I just do. Especially at night when out with friends.

It\u2019s a general courtesy to your spouse to let them know where you\u2019re going in case there\u2019s an emergency. Especially since you have two young children. \nAlso if someone is so intoxicated they can no longer drive, this means there is a heightened chance of an emergency occurring. Neither me or my husband drink but we let each other know where we are going when we leave the house. If I go out with friends I let him know.

That seems a million times worse than any of this.", "Lol we\u2019ve been married almost 20 years. It\u2019s literally a safety issue. My elderly parents and I share locations too. Do I not trust them? What about my sister? Sister in law?", "Maybe that's a sign that you're asking more than most people, including your own wife expect, and not even communicating that you expect it. That's not even the point I was making though.  The point I am making is you say you don't want to check her location, but asking her to constantly tell you her location updates is essentially the same thing. You want to know her location you just don't want to do it yourself, but you still want her location so what difference would it make her telling you rather than you checking it. You say one thing but contradict it later.", "I think the example you're using is a slippery slope fallacy.   \n\n\nThat if I tell her when I leave my hotel to head to the office eventually I'll tell her how many peas I ate off my plate at dinner.\n\nWhat I am learning is I guess most people don't share that information (not the peas, but--hey just landed, headed to the airport, headed to the office, etc) so I guess maybe I should dial that back.", "I texted her: \"Ubering to pick up your car. Be back in 15.\"  \n\n\nBut she was asleep, so she did not see this--but she would have if she woke up and found me gone.  \n\n\nAnd no, the children were not there.", "Many people don't share that information *unless explicitly asked.* YTA for not just saying to your wife, \"Hey, can you please let me know when you change locations when you go out?\" It's really not hard. My husband asks occasionally, and I oblige, but yes, I do expect him to ask if that's what he wants instead of expecting me to just assume it.", "Wheels down, landed safely.  Settled in the hotel - all reasonable information to share.  However, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t intend to tell her every location you travel to on this trip *in case something happens* - that would seem a bit ridiculous.\n\nShe went out for a girls night.  She was out with other people who, God forbid something happened to her, would have been able to contact you.  I would not think to tell my husband every time I changed location in these circumstances.  \n\nYou took reasonable steps to determine where she had to leave her car when she told you she would be driving with someone else and went into sweet, above and beyond territory by retrieving and gassing up the car for her.  You hit YTA territory when you laid out an expectation of her informing you of every move they made.", "I don\u2019t think so. I am trying to illustrate to you that the line is unclear and the onus is on *you* to define it. Similar to what you\u2019re saying in your last paragraph.\nSo in your opinion, you should notify your partner of plans before leaving the house (like telling if you have a business trip or going out with friends), but while you\u2019re out you should also notify of all venue changes even if you are already sharing your location on phone, and if you don\u2019t do that without asking, it\u2019s a character flaw. But if you share too many details like what you had for dinner, that\u2019s silly.\nIt sounds like your partners opinion is that you should tell about plans before leaving the house, but giving real-time updates about every single place you go is silly, especially if you are already sharing your location on your phone.\n\nWhere is the line? Who is right? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an answer because it\u2019s just 2 styles of thinking. You need to communicate about your lines. That\u2019s what I am trying to get across, hope it makes more sense.\n\nIn my opinion yta for how you handled the situation and for thinking of it like she has a character flaw, but you\u2019ve seemed pretty open minded from what I\u2019ve seen from your comments here so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like irredeemable or anything. But you\u2019re right I think you should cool off a bit. \n\nShe\u2019s out bar hopping with friends having fun, they\u2019re probably coming and going from bars without really thinking much of it. She\u2019s already sharing her location with you and she didn\u2019t expect you to get the car. If she did, maybe she would have manually shared her location with you proactively. We don\u2019t know. But you didn\u2019t have to get the car if you were mad at her about it, you\u2019ve been presenting it like you were doing her a favor but it was a really double-edged favor. By now she probably would\u2019ve preferred you didn\u2019t get her car, so she could avoid the argument.", "This is fair criticism and I accept your judgment. I can improve here."]}
