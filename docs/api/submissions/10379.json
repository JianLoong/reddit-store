They like to jump from a few different bars. We text sporadically but I trust her to be safe. She told me at one point she felt she was too drunk to drive and was going to leave her car there. We both have each others location on, so I looked at her location, made a note of it--it was 12 minutes from the house, no biggie. This is an important note and I have thought this in my head but never shared it with her but my wife generally does not tell me: \"We're going from this bar to this one,\" which I like for no other reason than being cognizant of it and knowing where she is at a given time.\n\nShe rode with a friend to the next bar and then had me come get her. She had work early in the morning so I took her home, helped her get in bed and then called an Uber to take me down the road to pick up her car. It was almost on empty so I stopped and filled it up and drove it home.\n\nNext morning she woke me up and said: \"We need to go get my car so I can go to work.\"\n\nI told her I had already went and got it and fueled it up so she was ready to go. She was pleasantly surprised and said: \"How did you know what bar it was at?\"  \n\n\nI told her: \"Well, when you said you were too drunk to drive I looked at your location and made a note of it. (THIS IS WHERE I THINK I MIGHT BE THE ASSHOLE) But to be honest, I wish I didn't have to do that. I wish you would let me know where you're going to be at just so I know in case anything happens to you. **Sometimes you don't do a great job at keeping me in the loop**.\"\n\nHer immediate retort is the character flaw. It doesn't just pop up when she goes out with a friend, it pops up often.

She does not have a responsibility to tell you about each bar or friend's house that they visit on a night out.  She is not a minor child.

From your other comments I think you need to take into perspective the scale of things you want filled in on vs. the scale of things that actually need communicating.\n\nYou keep bringing up a week-long business trip as an example, and wouldn't it be unfair if you didn't tell your wife about that - but being gone for a week is a much larger event than being gone for a couple hours at a bar or at the grocery store. It's the same idea as why a lot of couples will have a price point of purchases past which they will discuss things with each other - they will set a budget and decide to discuss purchases above $500 in advance, say, but they don't feel the need to talk about it when they're going to buy a bag of chips or a coffee. Or why it's totally fine to not fill your partner in on small details of work drama, but it would be weird to not tell your partner about major promotions or a job change or whatever.\n\nYour wife doesn't need to fill you in on every last detail of where she is, constantly, and if that makes you anxious that's a you problem that needs therapy. Relationships are built on trust, and part of that trust is letting the other person do the small things of life without you worrying about it.", "YTA\n\nIn a partnership you're both responsible for communication, it's not her sole responsibility.\n\n >Sometimes you don't do a great job at keeping me in the loop.\n\nHere, you're implying there are times she does keep you in the loop\n\n>The onus of responsibility is on you\n\nSo you feel it's her entire responsibility in those situations.

I legit text my boyfriend when I go anywhere cuz I know he likes to hear about my plans and what I'm up to. I never have to tell him..I just do. Especially at night when out with friends. It makes me feel safe knowing he knows where we are if anything were to go wrong..which has happened and he saved the day multiple times.", "NTA I\u2019ve read some of your comments regarding her picking up food without telling you or going to the store without telling you and then saying you should have asked as if you\u2019re a mind reader and knew that\u2019s where she was going. It\u2019s a general courtesy to your spouse to let them know where you\u2019re going in case there\u2019s an emergency. Especially since you have two young children. \nAlso if someone is so intoxicated they can no longer drive, this means there is a heightened chance of an emergency occurring. Neither me or my husband drink but we let each other know where we are going when we leave the house. If I go out with friends I let him know.

Throwing a wobbly because you want to be told her location in case you need to pick up her car except that you don\u2019t need it because you can find it anyway\u2026 isn\u2019t very rational", "Dude what is this lol. Kids go to visit their grandparents all the time, it's a completely normal thing", "My *mother* required less information from a teenager than this man does his adult wife. If my sister or I were hanging out with friends and we knew we\u2019d be moving around throughout the night or even that we might be, and she asked to at least know who we were with so if something happens and she can\u2019t get hold of us then she has something to go by. She knew it was possible that if she got strict then she we\u2019d sneak out and she wouldn\u2019t get to have any information like she did with her parents.

Yeah, totally she wasn't in a drunken stupor.", "The post says that she had already noted that she was too drunk to drive, and then went to another bar to continue drinking.", "You're right they aren't the same, but he doesn't need to know her specific location all the damn time. She's an adult who can take care of herself or ask for help if needed and she isn't alone.

That means you want them to be pretty much constantly thinking about you rather than enjoying themselves.", "Dude. Does she share her location on her cellphone with you or not?

If she went to a club dancing after or to someone elses place or left town for a great new bar, then maybe I could see what you mean, but everything she did fell exactly into the type of thing she told you. So what you are asking, even if you deny it is that she tells you everytime she moves somewhere. Like where do you draw the line? I've read.many of your comments and I honestly don't find it.

Because she wants more equality in the relationship and to stop feeling like she needs your permission to do things.", "The thing is, she did tell you. She said she was going \"out\" that would be similar to saying you're going out of town. \n\nYou're asking for constant updates, which is more like, \"going to Kinkos to make copies. Now back at the hotel room. Now heading to my first meeting.\" \n\nShe already told you she'd not be home, just like telling her about a trip out is telling her you won't be home.", "They aren't both important.\n\nThat she went to get food after work isn't important.

He didn't communicate that expectation and worried to her. It would be unreasonable for her to not care if he worried if she knew he was that worried. She most likely thinks she was doing a sufficient job communicating as he knew she was bar hopping with friends and the regular places. She thought that was enough and didn't know he wanted to know more. It's not that she doesn't care it's that she didn't know. I also didn't say it was unreasonable for him to be concerned about her safety, but that is was unreasonable to be upset with her for not providing unformation she wasn't aware he wanted. That is a reasonable concern, but the information he wants to know was not expressed."]}
