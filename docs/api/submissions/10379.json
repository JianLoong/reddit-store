They like to jump from a few different bars. We text sporadically but I trust her to be safe. She told me at one point she felt she was too drunk to drive and was going to leave her car there. We both have each others location on, so I looked at her location, made a note of it--it was 12 minutes from the house, no biggie. This is an important note and I have thought this in my head but never shared it with her but my wife generally does not tell me: \"We're going from this bar to this one,\" which I like for no other reason than being cognizant of it and knowing where she is at a given time.\n\nShe rode with a friend to the next bar and then had me come get her. She had work early in the morning so I took her home, helped her get in bed and then called an Uber to take me down the road to pick up her car. It was almost on empty so I stopped and filled it up and drove it home.\n\nNext morning she woke me up and said: \"We need to go get my car so I can go to work.\"\n\nI told her I had already went and got it and fueled it up so she was ready to go. She was pleasantly surprised and said: \"How did you know what bar it was at?\"  \n\n\nI told her: \"Well, when you said you were too drunk to drive I looked at your location and made a note of it. (THIS IS WHERE I THINK I MIGHT BE THE ASSHOLE) But to be honest, I wish I didn't have to do that. I wish you would let me know where you're going to be at just so I know in case anything happens to you. **Sometimes you don't do a great job at keeping me in the loop**.\"\n\nHer immediate retort is the character flaw. It doesn't just pop up when she goes out with a friend, it pops up often.

She does not have a responsibility to tell you about each bar or friend's house that they visit on a night out.  She is not a minor child.

From your other comments I think you need to take into perspective the scale of things you want filled in on vs. the scale of things that actually need communicating.\n\nYou keep bringing up a week-long business trip as an example, and wouldn't it be unfair if you didn't tell your wife about that - but being gone for a week is a much larger event than being gone for a couple hours at a bar or at the grocery store. It's the same idea as why a lot of couples will have a price point of purchases past which they will discuss things with each other - they will set a budget and decide to discuss purchases above $500 in advance, say, but they don't feel the need to talk about it when they're going to buy a bag of chips or a coffee. Or why it's totally fine to not fill your partner in on small details of work drama, but it would be weird to not tell your partner about major promotions or a job change or whatever.\n\nYour wife doesn't need to fill you in on every last detail of where she is, constantly, and if that makes you anxious that's a you problem that needs therapy. Relationships are built on trust, and part of that trust is letting the other person do the small things of life without you worrying about it.", "YTA\n\nIn a partnership you're both responsible for communication, it's not her sole responsibility.\n\n >Sometimes you don't do a great job at keeping me in the loop.\n\nHere, you're implying there are times she does keep you in the loop\n\n>The onus of responsibility is on you\n\nSo you feel it's her entire responsibility in those situations.

I legit text my boyfriend when I go anywhere cuz I know he likes to hear about my plans and what I'm up to. I never have to tell him..I just do. Especially at night when out with friends.

It\u2019s a general courtesy to your spouse to let them know where you\u2019re going in case there\u2019s an emergency. Especially since you have two young children. \nAlso if someone is so intoxicated they can no longer drive, this means there is a heightened chance of an emergency occurring. Neither me or my husband drink but we let each other know where we are going when we leave the house. If I go out with friends I let him know.

In fact it seems like she was fully prepared to do that herself", "Yeah I agree, a vague idea, like I\u2019ll be in Camden or I\u2019ll be around this area. Your spouse doesn\u2019t need to know everytime you go to a new bar, especially if they\u2019re close to each other which I\u2019m guessing they are. That\u2019s just being controlling and obsessive", "That may work for your relationship but alot of people would find that annoying. I wouldn\u2019t want to feel like I have to update my partner every hour or get moaned at", "Yeah I completely agree, there\u2019s no risk of driving drunk if you get an Uber.", "This was one of multiple examples of her just not being considerate of her partner. How hard is it to understand that her husband may feel more at ease with a 10-second text from her. Or maybe he wants to know she actually thinks about him and not just herself", "I see controlling men on these posts a lot. He doesn\u2019t strike me as one. He strikes me as someone who is tired of having to clean up after his wife in situations like this. Hence, the snarky comment.", "She knew he wanted to know her location because she asked him to pick her up. It\u2019s pretty normal to tell people where you are if you ask for a lift. It shouldn\u2019t be expected for the person going out of there way to ask for the location.", "I would just think that if you have kids at home and work the next day, you shouldn\u2019t get so drunk you can\u2019t message your spouse where you are or left the car.", "that\u2019s great for you lmao, but that\u2019s clearly not the case here. unless you\u2019re in this relationship?", "If I told her she needed to Uber to go get HER car that SHE left because SHE got too drunk she would not have spoken to me for two days.\n\nWhat do you want me to do?", "Now you're just looking for every excuse to justify always needing a location. Sure there is a chance signal won't work but in the US (where I am assuming this is given the context and such) the likelyhood of signal not working especially in a city or town which they likely are given the bar hopping is low. Also if her signal doesn't work she's out with friends you could contact them, and again they have a few places they like to go so he could also check in to those places. If the signal doesn't work then her calling or texting him the updates wouldn't matter anyways as there is no signal.", "He can't be upset with her for not doing those thing if he didn't communicate to her he expected those things though. It sounds like they were in contact and he knew she would likely be in a few places so it's not like she was just not telling him anything and disappearing. She told him what she thought was an appropriate amount and he is upset she didn't tell him more without expressing he would like to know more. I understand her husband would be more at ease with that text but he has to communicate that to her", "But if she was bar hopping and moving around should it make more sense to wait until she\u2019s at the last location where she is going to need to be picked up? Plus he\u2019s tracking her phone location so he already knew where she was. It sounds like she updated him when her plans changed (to leave her car and the fact that she would need a ride later) and when she was ready to be picked up. What additional information would he need?", "What are you going on about? The core of this conflict isn't that she didn't tell him where she was when she needed a ride. OP doesn't say anything about not being told her location when she asked for a ride so it's wild you even bring it up. It's even crazier when you consider the fact that she shares her location with him so he already had all the information he both wanted and needed. He's just demanding she do the work of informing him rather than doing it himself. \n\nThe core of this conflict is that he wanted a detailed play by play of where she was throughout the night and he failed to tell her that he wanted that. So now he is blaming her for not reading his mind. If he wants that detailed of information then he needs to ask for it.", "Sounds like two days of peace and quiet to me my guy! I\u2019m not gonna drop judgment, but if I was in your position I would just stop doing shit like this. From the sounds of it, you can\u2019t win - so stop playing. When she needs help she can ask, like an adult!", "> If I told her she needed to Uber to go get HER car that SHE left because SHE got too drunk she would not have spoken to me for two days.\n\nSorry, but this is not normal. You seem to have a very unhealthy dynamic in your relationship, but this is far beyond reddits pay grade.", "Oh dude, this is so not ok for her to do. \n\nDoes she do stuff like that often?", "Talk to your wife?!", ">Now you're just looking for every excuse to justify always needing a location\n\nis the partner always sloppy drunk and needing help to get home?", "It seems like he has, and he is tired of it but seriously I just don't get couples that don't think about their partner at all. The biggest thing I've seen to back up she doesn't even think of him, is the picking up something for dinner only for herself. Like is he supposed to text her everyday and be like our we having dinner together.", "I literally just asked my wife and she said she would be a bit upset if I told her that she had to Uber to go get her car today and would have \u201cjust sat her in her and sobered up and driven home if I\u2019m going to have to Uber to go get it the next day.\u201d", "What is not okay for her to do? Can you explain?", "About what?!", "We don't know that and even then it isn't justifiable to need it the entire time she's out. She can always send a text and update the location when she's starting to that point of intoxication.", "Actually if you look at his comments it doesn't seem like he has, as he literally has said he will do better about communicating it in the future."]}
