{"id": 23500, "submission_id": "15dt4nk", "title": "AITA for asking my son to come home to help with his kids, while his wife was being induced?", "selftext": "Throwaway account for privacy. I had to repost, because my first post was stopped. Made a few edits.\n\nI (71 female) have a son (39 male ) whose wife (36 female) gave birth to their fourth child nine months ago. All of her births have taken a long time, and she has been induced the last two times, including this one.\n\nMy husband (72 male) and I were babysitting the three older kids (5 male, 4 female and 2 female). She was induced at eight in the morning, and by one in the afternoon, there was not much progress, if any at all. Since the kids are a handfull, I told my son he needed to come home to help for a few hours, since it looked like it would take a really long time.\n\nSince they live half an hour away from the hospital, he could go back if anything happened, so it is not like he wouldn\u2019t be present when the child was born, which I ofcourse understand is a big moment for him and his wife.\n\nMy son took great offense to my request and told me to suck it up, bribe the kids with treats or whatever worked for us, and that there was no way he would leave his wife\u2019s side, unless there was an emergency with one of the kids, like they were admitted to the hospital or something.\n\nI told him that the kids were their responsibility, and that they couldn\u2019t expect us to babysit around the clock if this took days. He told me we should not have said yes to babysit at all if we wouldn\u2019t stick it out, since one never knows how long a birth will take, but that he would get someone to come and then he hung up. Three hours later someone showed up and we went home.\n\nWe offered to babysit for a few hours the next day, but our offer was declined, because the people who came to relieve us, stayed until the baby was born and my son came home.\n\nAfter this they have not asked us to babysit once and has hired a sitter instead, which we feel is a waste of money, since we are available for free. We get to see the grandkids if we visit them, but they very seldom visit us, compared to before.\n\nI tried talking to both my son and DIL, but they said they felt we didn\u2019t respect them at all since we wouldn\u2019t \u201ceven let her give birth in peace\u201d. My husband and I agree that they are overreacting, since she did not, in fact, give birth until seven the next morning, 23 hours after being induced, and our son could very easily have helped us with the kids for a few hours.\n\nSo AITA like my son says I am, for helping us with the kids, even if his wife was being induced, but had little to no progress?\n\nEDIT: 1)This is my first ever post (had to repost and also delete one time, because I did it wrong apparently), 2) I have NOTHING to do with the woman making weird comments about autoimmune issues caused by a dog, 3) My DIL was NOT in active labor when I asked- they were walking around in the hospital, trying to get things started.

You know birthing takes a long time in general but you know that your sons wife takes longer than usual. You agreed to babysit during birth knowing these things. Asking your son to leave his laboring wife for anything short of an emergency with one of his children is a gross manipulative thing to do. Who knows why you\u2019re on such a big power trip over your son and his marriage but it\u2019s very obvious to anyone looking at your actions. Good for your son and his wife hiring a sitter instead of playing into your delusions", "You needed to be relieved after 5 hours? Why did you offer to do/accept the job? Why would you think that they would ever leave 4 kids with you when you've proven you can't handle 3 for 5 hours? YTA.", "YTA. Why are you surprised that your son isn\u2019t asking you to baby sit anymore when you couldn\u2019t fulfil the responsibility to begin with? \n\nIt was a big moment in his life and he was, kindly, trying to support and stay by his wife\u2019s side; for you to call him back completely defeats the purpose of getting someone to look after his kids. If you couldn\u2019t handle it, you shouldn\u2019t have put yourself forth as an option. \n\nA half an hour ride is enough to miss a birth btw\u2026 it depends and differs between people. If he could come home, he wouldn\u2019t need you there.\n\nYTA for offering yourself to help, yta for doing a half-assed job and not knowing why he\u2019s upset and YTA for even thinking that you would be considered again for a job you couldn\u2019t even handle the first time.", "YTA! How can you possibly think you aren\u2019t the AHs here? Let\u2019s recap: \n\n1) You offer to watch your grandkids while you son and DIL are in labor, but after a few hours decide it\u2019s too much for you\u2026\n2) So you demand that your son leave his wife, who is *in labor*, to come watch them\n3) Then you have the nerve to belittle their feelings about the whole situation\n\nYou aren\u2019t reliable, and have made it clear you aren\u2019t capable of baby sitting for even a few hours without causing drama. Why would they ever trust you with their kids again?", "INFO: was there any implication from you or your son when you were making the plans to babysit that you\u2019d only be baby sitting for a certain length of time?\n\nbecause if not, you\u2019ve seen his wife go through 3 long births already, you should\u2019ve known you were potentially signing up for a long shift. him not wanting to leave her side unless there was an emergency is completely fair.", "YTA.  Your DIL has a history of taking a long time to give birth.  If you are not ready to help with watching the kids the entire time  then you should have said no.  Glad your son was able to find someone more reliable.", "Respectfully YTA.\n\nYour son did pretty much everything right and you did pretty much everything wrong. His wife was induced and you expect him to leave her alone and \"help you\" watch the kids when it was your duty which you agreed to!?\n\nYou should apologise to him and his wife and say you guys made a mistake and find a way to make it up to them.", "YTA- I\u2019m assuming since you are a mother that you have given birth before. I\u2019m not sure why you would expect a husband to leave his wife alone in the hospital while giving birth. Just because she didn\u2019t give birth in the time he theoretically would have been there to help with the kids doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t have gone differently. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want the responsibility of taking care of your grandchildren while your daughter-in-law is going through labor, don\u2019t offer. Not being asked is the natural consequence of showing your son you can\u2019t handle your grandchildren for an extended period of time. They don\u2019t trust you to not pull this again.", "YTA.  You asked him to come get your grandkids because you could not handle caring for them when his wife was in the hospital and now that they have found more reliable help, you are mad because they won't let you watch the kids?  Seriously?  Actions... meet Consequences.  This is your own fault.", "YTA \ud83d\udcaf!!  Every birth is different. Induced or natural, I've had both. My second child was natural, I went from 6-9 cm in less than 30 minutes!!  Third child was induced & was the quickest labor, (not by much). If you couldn't handle the children, I can understand that. Maybe you could have asked another family member to help? But geez, asking the father/husband to come home?  Get a grip!!", "This has to be a joke?  Please tell me this isn't real.  They weren't out clubbing,  they were giving you another grandchild.   \n\nI would never ask you to watch the kids either.   If the kids were going to be too much you should habe told them to make other arrangements before you agreed to watch them.\n\nSorry grandma,  yta.", "YTA-Don\u2019t volunteer to babysit while mom is at the hospital unless you\u2019re prepared to wait out the birth. Your son wasn\u2019t overreacting at all. You and your husband couldn\u2019t be more wrong in this situation. I wouldn\u2019t have you babysitting again either. I\u2019d be afraid of the moment you once again decided the kids were too much and demanded he or she come get them.", "You don\u2019t come for free, you come with the burden of knowing you could let them down at any time.\n\nThe whole point was to look after the children while he was there to support his wife who was giving birth.\nBut you asked him to come and babysit you instead.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  This is actually hilarious to me.  Of course they don\u2019t want you to babysit anymore!  They can\u2019t trust you.", "YTA. And these are \"your grandkids,\" not just \"his kids.\" Just say no if you're not capable or willing to babysit.\n\nThis honestly doesn't sound like it was written by a grandparent at all.", "I opened this up expecting to see that he was golfing or gaming, not supporting his wife through labor. You said it yourself, you couldn\u2019t handle them, why would you ever expect to be asked to babysit again? YTA.", "YTA  If 5 hours is too long, why did you agree to watch them during labor? How long did you think it would take?", "Sorry, YTA.  You agreed to cover the children while your DIL was induced.  Everyone knows this typically takes time, but how much time is unknown.  Your son was so right to not leave his wife's side.  \n\nYou should never have agreed to take on this responsibility if you couldn't manage it.  I'm not faulting your not being up to the job so much as that you knew how the kids are and surely had some concept of what to expect.  Asking your son to figure some backup was fine, but expecting him to abandon his wife at that moment was not reasonable.  \n\nYou let them down at an important moment and actually added stress by their needing, in the midst of things, to find someone else to watch the children.  Would have been so much better if you had just told them from the get-go that you weren't up to it and then they could have made other arrangements instead of your dumping that demand on them while the process was in progress.  \n\nAs for no longer asking you to babysit, I get that.  You basically defaulted at five hours with three children.  They're understandably not comfortable now with leaving you with four children, one being an infant. And, frankly, that is a lot to handle for anyone, not just someone in their 70s.  Don't resent their call on this as it sounds like the right one too.  \n\nLastly, as one who is 73 with some late-in-life grandchildren too who often end up in my care, I get what a handful this can be.  Simply, we are no longer used to the pace that young ones bring and we're not as energetic and tireless as we once were.  I know in my family they sometimes don't see or understand my limitations.  So, I will say maybe there is some fault here with the parents in inadvertently not realizing this was a lot for you to handle.", "Yes, YTA. Everyone else has pretty much covered the reasoning.", "YTA. I've been in your position, babysitting the older kids while Mom was in labor. It was my cousin's three boys (9, 7, and 5 at the time) and they were a handful. But instead of calling my cousin to leave his girlfriend who was in labor, I called another family member(someone he'd approved of to babysit if I had to call off) to tag in and then called my cousin to tell him \"[Trusted Family Member] is going to watch the kids for a bit while I get some rest, I just wanted to let you know in case you decided to stop by and check on them.\" You shouldn't volunteer to watch kids unless you're going to commit 100% and have back up/contingency plans ready.", "Omg boomers I can\u2019t with you people.", "YTA you knew beforehand that it might be a long wait for her to give birth, if you had no intention in keeping the kids until she gave birth you shouldn't have agreed to watch them. You called him to watch the kids while his wife was giving birth, that is truly an awful and stressful thing to do to them. I can't blame them for finding other childcare arrangements after what you did.", "YTA. You knew what you were agreeing to, since you know your DIL doesn't have fast deliveries. Your son's place was with her, helping her during labor, and being there for the birth of their child.", "YTA and so is your husband.  If you couldn\u2019t have managed the babysitting you should have been upfront.  By demanding your son to leave his wife in middle of childbirth you created drama and unnecessary stress.  I don\u2019t blame your son for cutting you out of babysitting responsibilities.  You and your husband should have no opinions about have they are managing their child care as you clearly provided no support during a critical time.  Honestly I\u2019m not surprised that they only allow you supervised visits.  Be happy you are getting that.", "YOU are absolutely TAH.  What is wrong with you?", "YTA, you knew your DIL tends to long labours, you presumably knew from previous contact with your grandkids how energetic they are, and yet you volunteered to babysit. I'd understand it if it was a medical emergency, if you or your husband were taken ill, but no. You could have taken them to a play park to burn off that energy, or sat them in front of the tv to distract them, but despite free reign for bribery you demanded he leave his pregnant wife and not-yet-born child to relieve you on the babysitting front?", "YTA. You should not have agreed to watch them if you were going to expect him back in a few hours. Giving birth isn't the same as a date night.", "YTA- and a huge one at that. If you want a relationship going forward, you best be apologizing", "YTA you have shown yourself to not be responsible enough to leave their children with. They were relying on you and you decided that they weren\u2019t worth the effort and time. Call me crazy but some grandparents actually like spending time with their grandkids and would be excited for 23 hours together. You barely made it through 5 hours before you were throwing a tantrum and playing the victim. You couldn\u2019t come through for them in their time of crisis so now they don\u2019t trust you. Makes perfect sense. You are reaping what you have sowed. You aren\u2019t there for the hard times then you don\u2019t get the fun times", "Do you really need to ask? Of course YTA. They relied on you and you didn't stick to your word. \n\nAlso, 23hrs isn't that long. Did you think your DIL is going to pop the kid out as soon as she started labour? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\n\nApologize, OP. You were in the wrong and still are!", "YTA. I would never let you babysit my kids again. You have shown that you cannot handle it and are not responsible babysitters. You\u2019re lucky they still talk to you at all.", "INFO: Are you the same 71f who has previously posted AITAs about (1) how much you dislike all but one of your DILs and (2) your theory that your grandson's autoimmune disease is actually a dog allergy?", "YTA. Taking care of children is hard work. That\u2019s why child care costs so much. If you realized you weren\u2019t the right person for the job, you weren\u2019t wrong to want help but you were totally wrong to ask you son to leave his wife\u2019s side to help. I don\u2019t know why you thought that was acceptable. You owe your son and your DIL a huge apology. Be grateful they don\u2019t let you babysit anymore. You obviously can\u2019t handle it. I don\u2019t mean that to be negative. Some people just can\u2019t handle taking care of kids for long periods of time, especially as they get older.", "49F here, with grown kids.  YTA.  It sounds like you have a lot of trouble with not being the center of attention.  Who watched your children when you gave birth?", "You really have to ask if YTA???? Reeeeeeally?\n\nYes. YTA. \n\nIf you couldn\u2019t handle it, you shouldn\u2019t have said yes in the first place. \n\nLabor can change within a matter of minutes.", "Yeah sorry YTA giving birth can take hours to days and you knew that, your son and DIL were not expecting to have to find a backup babysitter in the middle of active labour.", "YTA. Why are you surprised they\u2019re offended and don\u2019t hang out with you anymore?", "YTA. Your daughter in law was in the middle of a very dangerous procedure and you wanted him to leave his wife for at least an hour to come watch the kids. You really wanted him to leave his wife alone for hours?? Have you apologized for your behavior?", "YTA you offered to babysit while she gave birth aka being there alone just you and your husband with them until your fourth grandchild was born and then rang saying you couldn\u2019t cope of course they don\u2019t want you babysitting anymore", "YTA. Did you forget what giving birth was like ? Your son was right. You should have never agreed to babysit. And now you're angry they don't want you to babysit, even though you've made it clear you can't take care of your grandkids for a few hours. He even sent someone to help you.", "Yta.Im guessing by the way they mentioned they can\u2019t even give birth in peace, you aren\u2019t exactly \u201ceasygoing\u201d when it comes to watching the little ones. They needed someone who could help during a medical procedure and that\u2019s not you. Stop volunteering to watch them. You clearly can\u2019t handle it and they have lost trust in your capacity for it. Just visit on birthdays and Christmas like most grandparents.", "YTA he\u2019s right, you shouldn\u2019t have agreed. Childbirth is crazy and scary, it can come barreling in out of nowhere. It can turn on a dime and become extremely dangerous. How could you put him in the position of having to worry about his children", "YTA \n\nThat was outrageous. If you didn\u2019t want the responsibility or couldn\u2019t handle them then you should never have agreed in the first place.\n\nWhat you don\u2019t do is agree and then start making demands when his wife is in the hospital being induced. What\u2019s wrong with you?", "YTA. You put unnecessary stress on them during a time when they didn\u2019t need it because, what, you didn\u2019t want to watch the kids anymore? You suck. Don\u2019t volunteer if you can\u2019t handle it. Also you didn\u2019t even have the kids overnight. Most grandparents have kids for a weekend and some even a week or longer. I get you\u2019re old but if it\u2019s too much, don\u2019t volunteer in the first place. \n\nYou and your husband can agree all you want but you are both selfish and inconsiderate and I wouldn\u2019t want you around my children either", "If my in-laws pulled a stunt like this I wouldn\u2019t ask them for a favour ever again. Why should they save their money and use you for \u201cfree\u201d when you aren\u2019t even reliable? No thanks. They\u2019re saving themselves the headache of dealing with you for childcare. Don\u2019t worry though, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll never inconvenience you again with the burden of caring for their kids. They\u2019ve found other ways to get care for the children. YTA.", "YTA\n\nAnd on a fast track to never seeing any of them again. I know I'd never bother with you again after this kind of selfishness. If you aren't actually willing to fulfill a commitment you made, don't say yes. \n\nSeeing your grandkids is a privilege, not a right.", "YTA. I can't even believe that you and your husband see nothing wrong with your actions.\n\nYou said her previous births were long... if this was even a concern to you before they left then you should have addressed it beforehand that you didn't want to watch them for the full birth.\n\nA lot can happen in 30min so imagine if your son came to help you out and the wife suddenly had an emergency or had to get a c-section?! 30min... that's actually quite far away/long.\n\nI honestly cannot wrap my head around your way if thinking. Sure young kids are a lot of work and it's HARD but you could have bribed them with treats or TV as your son suggested.", "YTA! Your son has his priorities in order to take care of his family, but his wife had to come first because guess what? HE's the daddy here! You want to force the Daddy to miss his child's birth if he came home to relieve you?! NOT GOOD for the wife who needs her husband as her support person! I am glad your son declined your offer because it shows that you don't understand how this works! Stop be so selfish and trying to make this all about yourself and your husband. You could had ask for other family members for help! NOPE, you installed your son to do this when he needed to be with his wife!", "YTA. Lady, last time I gave birth, my husband's coworker and his wife took care of our 2yo overnight - and we weren't even that close, our son was just friends with their 2yo (we were somewhat isolated at that point in our lives). They didn't complain, they didn't call us, they just kept our son safe until my husband went to pick him up. (This had all been discussed beforehand, we didn't just dump our son on them.)\n\nYes, three young kids are a lot, but these are your grandkids, and there were two of you adults there. You can't handle them for less than 24 hours? Have they never slept over at your place? If anything, you should have been the ones to call a friend and ask for extra help, if it was that hard for you.\n\nYou broke their trust. You won't be babysitting again.", "YTA! Oh my goodness, I\u2019m so glad for my parents and in laws. I\u2019m going to text all of them right now and tell them how much I appreciate them. So, thank you! You jerkiness has filled my heart with gratitude", ">He told me we should not have said yes to babysit at all if we wouldn\u2019t stick it out, since one never knows how long a birth will take, but that he would get someone to come and then he hung up.\n\nHe's right, everyone knows what agreeing to watch kids during a birth means. You showed him that you would be unreliable for him when he needed help most--of course he turned down your next offer to pretend to help. What if you bailed on him and he had to find a substitute sitter ...again? You two became more trouble than you're worth.\n\nYTA", "You know YTA.  I don\u2019t blame them for having a reliable friend takeover while she was in labor, nor for hiring sitters from now on.  \n\nAnd to then complain that a young family with a newborn and three small children won\u2019t drive to your house!?   Lady, you will likely be a stranger to those kids.", "YTA and I'll bet you'll take it further and threaten to sue for GP rights or whatever nonsense next occurs to you.  This won't have been your first offense and they've put you on low contact until your behaviour can improve.", "YTA. Birth is not an outpatient procedure. The fact that you expected him to come back at all on the day his wife was induced is idiotic. You should have expected to be watching them for at least 2 days when you accepted babysitting.", "YTA", "Wow you poor son not only is he worried about his wife and baby waiting to be born but heep more stress on them both by saying no I won't help I as a grandma would have mine for as long as they needed to help your selfish", "YTA, going got a little bit tough, and you wanted to get going..  knowing what young kids are like: you volunteered to babysit while 4 was being born.  Guess they are sparing you the struggle of a grandkids visit exhausting you now.", "Your son is a good man and he absolutely did the right thing.  You on the other hand was absolutely WRONG!  Giving birth is a major event and you should be fully aware of that.  How would you like it if your mother in law took your husband away from you while you were giving birth to your children?  If your daughter in law said that you couldn\u2019t \u201ceven let her give birth in peace\u201d. That means that there were probably other incidents prior to the birth.  \n\nWhy in your right mind would you think they would use you as a babysitter again after you pulled this at this important time.  Obviously babysitting to you has a time limit!", "How convenient that your husband is an echo chamber for your poor judgment.  Look, clearly watching that many little kids was exhausting for the two of you so your son and DIL are just doing you a favor by not asking you to babysit again.  YTA.", "Yta\n\nWhy would they ever trust you to babysit again if you couldn't even be reliable at a time like GIVING BIRTH?????", "Yeah YTA. If you knew from past experience that DIL\u2019s labor is long and that you couldn\u2019t handle their children for that long, you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to watch them. If you let your son and DIL know this upfront way before her labor began, they could\u2019ve arranged for a babysitter. It was wrong of you to try to make your son leave DIL while she was in labor.", "YTA you know it. Glad they don\u2019t use you anymore. They need reliable people not whiners.", "YTA it isn\u2019t really babysitting if your try to force the parents home", "YTA. But also, you've shown that you are both incapable of handling three children for a few hours and will go back on your agreement to watch them in the middle of doing so if it suits you. Why would they place the children in your care if they know it means they might have to stress out about finding an alternate plan at the last minute?", "YTA\nClearly you're one of those grandparents that wants all of the fun but none of the work, and that's okay. But right now your son needs help. You've proven you're not interested in helping. You're interested in being fun time for an hour (and let's be honest...as a parent that can lead to MORE work later after grandma hypes up your kids).\n\nChoose a lane, stay in it, and don't complain when what you want isnt what they need.", "YTA", "YTA, so much, and you already know it. Being induced is being in labor. Labor is painful, scary and exciting for both parents. There's a lot that could go wrong during labor, and I can't imagine doing it alone because my in-laws did not feel that my labor was adhering to their schedule.", "So, to be clear, you knew how long your DIL's labors were, knew this one could take a long time, and still agreed to watch the kids... And then told your son to come home and watch the kids **YOU** said you'd watch because it \"*would take a long time*\"?\n\nYTA\n\nAlso, \"*only*\" 30 minutes away *without* traffic can mean missing everything if she's in active labor. It can also mean not being there in case there's an emergency with the baby and/or mother. Thankfully nothing happened, but had it, those thirty minutes would've haunted your son for the rest of his life.", "YTA! That\u2019s it!", "YTA. I can't believe that you're being serious about this whole situation. This is a joke, right?\n\nYou expected your son to leave his wife, who was in labor, because you couldn't handle the kids. You should never have offered, and that is exactly why they won't allow you to babysit anymore.", "So you offered to mind the children and then complained about it and now want to complain that they are wasting money for sitters when you would have done it, despite complaining about it. \n\nWhen I has in labor with my 2nd, out family helped out with our oldest. No one complained about how long they were looking after the older child because they offered to help and knew that labor can be unpredictable so they didn't call us to ask my husband to watch the toddler for a few hours. \n\nWhat would you have done if you son had did what you insisted and then he missed the birth or a real emergency popped up and he was away?\n\nIf you were not up for watching 3 small children for duration of the labor you should never have offered.", "YTA. Yes, the kids are their responsibility but you agreed to take on that responsibility during the labor then backed out part of the way through. \n\nOf course they haven\u2019t asked you to babysit anymore because they can\u2019t trust your word anymore. Paying for a sitter who will babysit for the allotted time is better than a free sitter who is gonna decide they want to do something else half way through.", "YTA and I understand why he does not and probably will not for a long time want to ask you for anything. If you know the birth is a long process and you could not handle the kids during the process you should have spoken up earlier so your son could get another sitter to deal with the kids.

I had to repost, because my first post was stopped. Made a few edits.\r  \n\r  \nI (71 female) have a son (39 male ) whose wife (36 female) gave birth to their fourth child nine months ago. All of her births have taken a long time, and she has been induced the last two times, including this one.\r  \n\r  \nMy husband (72 male) and I were babysitting the three older kids (5 male, 4 female and 2 female). She was induced at eight in the morning, and by one in the afternoon, there was not much progress, if any at all. Since the kids are a handfull, I told my son he needed to come home to help for a few hours, since it looked like it would take a really long time.\r  \n\r  \nSince they live half an hour away from the hospital, he could go back if anything happened, so it is not like he wouldn\u2019t be present when the child was born, which I ofcourse understand is a big moment for him and his wife. \n\nMy son took great offense to my request and told me to suck it up, bribe the kids with treats or whatever worked for us, and that there was no way he would leave his wife\u2019s side, unless there was an emergency with one of the kids, like they were admitted to the hospital or something.\r  \n\r  \nI told him that the kids were their responsibility, and that they couldn\u2019t expect us to babysit around the clock if this took days. He told me we should not have said yes to babysit at all if we wouldn\u2019t stick it out, since one never knows how long a birth will take, but that he would get someone to come and then he hung up. Three hours later someone showed up and we went home.\r  \n\r  \nWe offered to babysit for a few hours the next day, but our offer was declined, because the people who came to relieve us, stayed until the baby was born and my son came home.\r  \n\r  \nAfter this they have not asked us to babysit once and has hired a sitter instead, which we feel is a waste of money, since we are available for free. We get to see the grandkids if we visit them, but they very seldom visit us, compared to before.\r  \n\r  \nI tried talking to both my son and DIL, but they said they felt we didn\u2019t respect them at all since we wouldn\u2019t \u201ceven let her give birth in peace\u201d. My husband and I agree that they are overreacting, since she did not, in fact, give birth until seven the next morning, 23 hours after being induced, and our son could very easily have helped us with the kids for a few hours.\r  \n\r  \nSo AITA like my son says I am, for helping us with the kids, even if his wife was being induced, but had little to no progress?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why offer childcare you aren't willing to provide?  23 hours is really fast, and induction is slow, fast and unpredictable.  It's a terrible idea to leave and betrays your partner's trust.

You offered to watch your grandkids, and if the kids were a handful take them somewhere to burn off some energy if you have their car seats. Let them run around outside.

If you want to see your grandkids, start by being trustworthy people, because your ACTIONS have shown that you are not.

Induced contractions are estimated to be 20% more intense than non-induced. Your DIL needed her husband there and he wanted to be by her side. Even if it took a few days, they would have been thankful for a lifetime if you just helped instead of hindered. \n\nYour son saying \"you couldn't even let her give birth in peace\" suggests you've given her a hard time before. Judging by your post, it appears likely that you are difficult to be around. \n\nOn a personal note, I was induced in November and had an allergic reaction to the pitocin which resulted in being very close to a seizure, stroke or just straight up death. My husband was unable to be by my side due to my induction being outside of visiting hours which made the whole ordeal much worse. Thankfully he was able to get there in time for my emergency c section. \n\nIf you want a good relationship with your son and his family, do better.", "Yes, his children are his responsibility. And he very responsibly arranged for what he thought would be competent and reliable child care with people who understand that childbirth can have unexpected hurdles. *Yes, he should have been able to expect you to sit with the kids around the clock if it took days because you had agreed to watch the kids until after the baby was born!!!* You let him down in a very big way. The entire point of having you there was so that he could devote his entire attention to his wife, with no distractions. \n\nYou have proven yourself to be unreliable in an important situation. You cannot be trusted. Your son will probably never ask you to babysit again, and rightfully so. YTA", "YTA\u2026. Be very very grateful that they still allow you to see the grandkids when you visit. \nStop complaining that they are paying someone.\nYou proved yourself to be unreliable.", "YTA. I understand that it's hard to keep up with three kids at 71 years old, but you knew that when you offered. Yes he could've helped with them for a few hours and got back before she gave birth, but he had no way of knowing that at the time. From his point of view you asked him to miss the birth of his fourth child and leave his wife to go through one of the most difficult experiences she will ever have ALONE. If you ever want to fix this, don't try to justify it or make any excuses, just apologize. If they don't want you to babysit anymore, that's probably for the best anyway, it 's proven to be too much for you.", "YTA. You're available for free? Only for as long as it suits you, apparently. Your son is exactly right - nobody knew how ling his wife would be in hospital, so if you couldn't handle the kids, you shouldn't have taken them.

If you can't be reliable, he'll find somebody who is.  \n\n\nI can't even imagine how stressed your son was, dealing with your whining while his wife was in a difficult labor.

After only a few hours you changed your mind and wanted your son to abandon his wife during a time that is high stress and when she would be in pain. Then because of that they had to take time out of her *giving birth* to arrange an alternative, piling more stress onto them because you decided your needs were more important.\n\nA sincere apology from you both is in order, because you just proved to them that they can\u2019t trust you to take care of their kids even when something as important as a birth is happening", "YTA - Although I'm sure really stressful with scrambling to find a sitter so last minute, I'm so glad your son stayed and supported his wife.

I totally understand you are older, and it must have been a lot. When you took on that responsibility, it was so they could handle their business with the new baby. You could\u2019ve easily reached out to someone else to come assist or a play date or some thing. Your son had a lot on his plate, and that was just adding to his level of stress.\n\nSince you have proven to be unreliable, that is why they are not relying on you now. What if you did the same thing again and decided the kids were too much when they were in the middle of a movie or dinner with friends ?", "YTA and ridiculous.\n\nYou don't get to babysit anymore because you can't babysit. You know, how you couldn't? So you called them in the middle of an emergency and made it worse? You couldn't even figure out maybe you should call your friends to come help you. You have no ability to problem solve, and are no good in a crisis.\n\nYou're also very disrespectful of your daughter in law. Why should she have to be alone in pain labouring without her partner when there were supposedly responsible babysitters that agreed in advance? \n\nThe idea is NOT that your son be there at the end, you AH. It's that he be a support person throughout the delivery. It actually isn't just he can't miss the good happy tears after - it's that she needed someone there and you actively disregard and disparage that need after you agreed to help. How is it overreacting that you think she should have laboured alone for hours because you and your husband are untrustworthy?", "YTA. This feels very much like an out of touch Boomer kind of problem. It's not how it used to be. Dads are very involved with L&D now. They participate as much as they can. They see it as part of their role. And Moms now expect to be supported during this period. Gone are the days when dads popped in for the actual birth. Long gone are the days when mom did the whole thing under sedation. And thank god for that.\n\nYou knew her labors were long. You presumably knew your grandkids are a handful since you used to sit for them all the time. Why did you agree to watch the kids if you weren't up to it? Maybe you should recognize that you don't have the patience or energy that you used to and just accept that babysitting just isn't how you're going to be spending time with your grandkids.

I do agree that is a lot of kids for two older people to deal with, but you didn't even make it 5 hours before you started complaining? Why didn't you just ask him if someone could come give you a break for a bit? Was it not discussed that you would be staying with the kids overnight?\n\nWhen I was induced with my current baby, my son was dropped off at my mother's with overnight stuff. I was sent home after the first stage of induction to wait and see when they'd have enough staff for my full induction. My mother didn't ask us to come get my son or complain.

BTW, This is a rhetorical question. \n\nGiving birth is called Labor for a reason. Your DIL needed her husband with her.

They offered to babysit and then complained about it to a man who was busy worrying about his laboring wife. The whole point of having someone watch your other kids during that time is not having to worry about them.\n\nYTA Op and your son probably feels he cant trust you with the kids anymore since you said you couldnt handle them.", "I totally agree. OP is YTA. A huge one.\nTo OP: they don\u2019t want to babysit because clearly they cannot trust you.

I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re surprised by their reaction. You changed your mind DURING LABOUR. As if your son and his wife needed to be bothered during such an intimate and intense time.

It happened so fast I could barely comprehend what was happening. I say it was 10 mins but honestly it could have been faster. I already had my epidural in because we all thought a standard vaginal delivery was going to happen, they broke my water and almost immediately baby girl wasn't doing good and people flooded into the room. My husband barely had time to get the whole paper scrubs outfit on and get in the room before they cut me open.

It's one thing to deny babysitting because you feel it's to much for you. It's another thing to agree and then tell your son he should desert his wife when she needs him as her support. And you don't even see how much you failed them, and you don't even apologize... So yes, it's very understandable that they go low contact with you.

He was there to help support his wife who was in active labor. It's a scary, painful process and he was doing a really important job! It's not like everyone could just take a break because she wasn't crowning yet.\n\n\nEdit: well actually there are some thumb twiddling moments haha but the point is that you're there twiddling your thumbs together, not leaving the wife all by herself when she's in labor.", "Because when the OP was giving birth, they didn't allow dads into the birthing room. They had to sit outside and wait.\n\nOften times, the mothers were also gorked out on narcotics so they didn't remember the pain and potential trauma (childbirth was a lot more barbaric at that time).\n\nSo, quite literally in the 70s, it is entirely likely that the fathers would play zero part in the delivery. Not excusing the OP, but she may have zero idea how things go now.", "And did you catch it was only after 5 hours post induction she needed help?

So, you let them down and made the time more stressful for your son by arguing with him and creating this situation where he had to find alternate babysitters while at the hospital! He was at the hospital 30 minutes away when you called for help. Do you really think they could expect to have a peaceful night out at a restaurant 10 minutes away while you watch the kids? Or a workday of peace? No. Free useless, unreliable help is no help at all. A good babysitter is worth every penny spent.", "Absolutely not!", "They are in their 70s.

They do not have to let you babysit, as you have seen. When apologizing, it\u2019s important for you to identify what you did wrong and what you will do to not let it happen in the future. Do NOT say \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel\u2026\u201d because that is invalidating that you did something wrong. Instead that implies that the way they are interpreting the situation is wrong.

The main thing is that, because of your false commitment, your son and his wife were forced to scramble for a babysitter when she was already in the hospital.

Three kids under 5 are a handful.  And four even more so.  And more specifically, they are too much for you and your husband to handle on your own.  There is nothing wrong with this.  It's to be expected.  But it's important for you to recognize this and admit it to yourself.  It sounds like your son and his wife have, even if they haven't told you this directly.\n\nDeep down you know this.  Because you called and asked for help.  Unlike others, I commend you for recognizing this and asking for help.  Far better to ask for help than to have tried to soldier through and put the kids in danger in some way.  That would have been far worse.  Would it have been better to have recognized this ahead of time and not have volunteered to help?  Absolutely.  But if there was ever a situation where one would want to help and be tempted to overestimate their ability until they were in the situation, this is certainly it.\n\nBut now we come to the point where YTA.  You could have looked for help yourself without involving your son.  Or you could have called him up and apologized but told him you realized you are over your heads and you needed help and who could you call.  You didn't.  You dumped the problem on his lap and even wanted him to come home.\n\nBut then you didn't stop there.  After the fact you have reverted back to your prior stance.  You are fooling yourself into thinking you can handle four kids under 5.  You can't.  Aging is hard but accept that fact.  Don't do something that could put your grandkids in danger and don't be mad at your son for not letting you do so.  He may not be this direct to you but I will be.  You should not be watching all 4 grandkids at the same time.  They are too much for you to handle.  Period.  \n\nSo now that YTA, what do you do?\n\n1.  Admit to your self that your son is right and you should not be babysitting all 4 grandkids at the same time and that they should be getting a babysitter instead of you.\n2. Recognize that your son is not over-reacting.  He is probably (1) frustrated that you don't recognize that you were wrong and unreasonable and (2) realizing that you and your husband are getting older and can't do everything you used to be able to.  That's hard for all of us to accept.  Plus, he's probably kicking himself for not realizing it before having you watch the kids in the first place.  You weren't the only one who was late to realize they were too much for you.  He missed it to.\n3. Call you son, apologize, and tell him you know realize he is right and you should not be babysitting all 4 grandkids.  They are too much and you realize that now.  Your sorry it took this situation to realize it but you were fooling yourself with good intentions.\n4. Tell them that you miss seeing the kids a would love to see them more but also understand how busy they are with the new baby and you understand.\n5. Tell him if they are comfortable (and if you are comfortable), you would love to take one or two of the kids off their hands for a couple hours just to give them a break.\n6.
