Whatever label you want to put on it op still agreed to invite the child into his home just like the husband has invited ops children into his home.", "Agreed he took on that responsibility when they married, but wouldn't OP at that point have taken that same responsibility when he welcomed the child into his home? Also ur totally right if OP doesn't like the arrangement then he is free to terminate it.", "Ok so I agree provide healthy options but don't deny someone food. I agree teach kids how to eat properly. Have you read some of the comments on here? I've seen some people saying give him a burger so you can claim he ate like wtf.", "OP seems like a stand up guy. His kindness is being abused though.", "That is a ridiculous suggestion. No kid can eat 4 burgers just because his father told him to. He would be sick if he were not accustomed to it.", "I don't really think you can convince kids to remember to do things outside their nature as often as you're suggesting, just not seeing it.", "The OP might not pay child support, but the OP also has his kids Wednesday through Saturday. That's four days that the OP is paying for food and such for his kids. It isn't clear if the OP is buying clothes, school supplies, etc.", "If this is the quantities the lad normally eats I'd be taking him for a check up. It's not a normal amount of food to consume, esp with wanting more food so soon afterwards", "Child support does not fully support a child. The custodial parent is also paying to take care of the children.", "Respectfully disagree. OP does not (yet) state he\u2019s paying CS. Also, by the same logic you use to state Michael has responsibility over the kids by proxy, thus OP has responsibility over Michael\u2019s son by Michael sending him over.\n\nI think the details matter - is OP paying CS? If so, Michael should pay it too. If not, OP should just feed the kid. Fair is fair.", "If I kept asking for food when growing up I was directed to the fruit bowl or I could make myself some extra peanut butter sandwiches.", "My son ate 6 sloppy joes and a salad the other day at dinner and was hungry an hour later. Some boys legitimately can eat you out of house and home. I\u2019m still amazed at what my son can put away. No weight problem. It comes in phases.", "Hamburger so good", "Yeah that\u2019s not normal. Where is that kids mom? How sad that his dad only wants him around less than half time. My mom never let me leave the damn house lol", "He\u2019s fine!  Boys can eat a lot when they are growing.", "Maybe I'm being silly, but has he been checked for worms? Tapeworm in particular. I know that it's probably uncommon out there, but my nephew picked them up when he was 10. I mean growing boys and all that. But maybe suggest to the ex wife that they have him checked.\nAlso, NTA. You're a saint for taking on someone else's kid, just because it makes your kid happy. Michael, however sounds like a babysitter dad.", "Do you never want to spend quality time with your own children ? Are your visitation days going to be just day care ? Xander\u2019s dad is married to a woman with children , so he has to house and feed your kids. You , on the other hand are not obligated. If you ever got married to a woman with kids , are you going to dump them on your ex wife and Xander\u2019s dad to house and feed for days at a time ? Also, it is likely that they are encouraging this \u201csleep in the same bed , inseparable kids\u201d scenario for their own benefit and not for the good of the kids.", "Could be a medical condition could also be he\u2019s eating \u201cempty\u201d calories - with fast food/junk food you won\u2019t feel as full because they don\u2019t digest and get used in the body as whole foods \n\nEither way, you shouldn\u2019t be expected to watch another kid for more than half a week without compensation. \n\nI have a friend who\u2019s son also ended up getting two more half siblings when the ex remarried and while they all get along, he only allowed the half siblings (and these were the sons half siblings, not step siblings) to come over one day/night a week. And as they got older, even less.\n\nAnd if he were ever asked or offered to take all the kids out for a special event like Disneyland - the ex and her new husband would alway give him money to cover their kids.", "FOUR BURGERS at 9 years old?? Plus at in n out he\u2019s likely eating fries and a sugary drink too. No, I\u2019ve never seen that except on tv when they\u2019re reporting on health issues", "He also doesn\u2019t have to pay for more food for the kid than he does his own children. If they eat two burgers - Xander gets two.", "When the kids are are at Michael's house, it is also the mothers house.   OP is not a parent to Michael's kid.", "No.  It's not.  Op has zero responsibility for his ex's stepkid.", "Not the same. When OP's kids are in Michael's house, Michael's wife (OP's ex) is responsible to feed them. If Michael is using his own money to feed them, he needs to address that with his wife. OP isn't responsible for his kid's food during those times.\n\nBut, Michael is ALWAYS responsible to feed Xander. But, if OP is doing it effectively half the time, that is unfair to OP. It is perfectly reasonable for him to ask Michael for money for the food he is giving to Xander.", "No. At no point did OP choose to commit himself to indefinitely raising this child. He was kind enough to take him during his custody time to help facilitate the close relationship the child has with his own children, but that does not obligate him to financially support the child, which is what you\u2019re basically arguing. If someone is essentially doing you a favor by providing regular free babysitting, the very least you can do is make sure they are not negatively financially impacted by it.", "It\u2019s not him denying the kid food. He cannot and should not be paying for the amount of food he\u2019s paying for, for a kid that is no way his responsibility or relation. I would literally never send my child to someone\u2019s house without money unless they explicitly say not to worry about it and EVEN THEN, if my kid acts like a starving garbage disposal and they don\u2019t tell them no because they\u2019re trying to be nice (as most people would), I would absolutely pay them back. It\u2019s just a courtesy. The stepdad is so in the wrong here and I see absolutely nothing wrong with what OP did.", "If he normally eats like this, his parents should get him medically checked. \n\nNo way is this a normal amount of food, let alone since he feels hungry a couple of hours later", "He could just be having a growth spurt.", "Child support is not mentioned, one way or the other. OP said he has his children Wed-Sat, which could indicate shared custody. Let\u2019s not assume. \n\nNTA, but allowing a 9 year old to consume that many junk-calories isn\u2019t good for them. But some fruit for the kids. Tell them no to that many burgers. And potentially limit how much you take Michael\u2019s kid. I love that they are close. But OP, you need to chat with your ex and Michael and come up with a pre agreed upon plan. It is a bit tacky to ask post-event. But I get why you asked.", "Yeah... but I is not typical to provide for your ex's new partners children. \n\nit sounds like this dad fully meets, and exceeds his obligations.", "As they should", "In most cases... The child doesn't even see the money or benefit from it.", "CS is irrelevant. \nZander is not OPs son. He does not have an obligation to feed him. OPs son lives with his mother and zanders dad.. Mom has an obligation to feed her son.  \n\nOP just tell them they need to send Zander with his own money to pay for his meals.", "Unless custody is split 50/50 the custodial parent typically gets child support. So it's pretty logical to figure he is.", "That was me during my childhood and teen years, parents didn\u2019t believe me until they heard my stomach growl.\n\nGuess who barely eats now \ud83d\ude43", "I agree... but after that first burger, veggies are required. And if he doesn't eat them, he isn't hungry.", "Incredible how many people are missing that point. It would be comical if not for the utter realization that these people don\u2019t got a clue.", "So OP should start using the word NO if they don\u2019t want to pay for the extra kid.\n\nNo one forced him to buy four burgers for the kid", "That's why I said if he normally eats like this", "Totally agree..time to put boundaries in place..it's not up to him to support the other child", "Not for someone else's child", "If you were to take your kid and their friend out to eat\u2026 would you send a text to the parents asking for money AFTER??? \n\nOr would you say \u201chey, I want to take the kids out for dinner, would you be willing to pay for your kid?\u201d\n\nTwo different approaches.", "OP has the kids wed-sat.  That's 4 days.  The majority of the week.  He's the primary caregiver, by time spent with the kids.  If anything, OP should be receiving child support from ex.  And, if Xander is with OP the entire time he has his own kids, Michael should also be paying OP for babysitting him for than half the week.", "not how hunger works.", "That's not how people work, but ok.", "Yes, I agree, op should start using the word no, no Xander can't come over.", "... That is such a dick thing to do.\n\n\"Hey, I took your kid for dinner... gib MONEY!\"\n\nYou don't do that, even if the kid is a black hole."]}
