There are precious few Cajuns that still speak French or still practice the old ways of living. It's beautiful that your family is preserving our heritage. I really wish mine had. \n\nThat said, you can be welcoming despite him being an outsider. Some of his \"strangeness\" is probably not knowing how to fit in. That happens in any new culture. It takes effort, humility, and time. It's for his girlfriend to guide him/translate, and for y'all to be kind and inviting. That doesn't mean watering down tradition for him, though. Whether he remains part of the family or not, make the Cajun experience what it is known for-- being upbeat, welcoming, fun, and delicious!! Either he will respect and embrace the culture and help preserve it, or he will run. LOL! \n\nIf he doesn't eat Cajun food, he can bring something to share with y'all. It wouldn't hurt to have a vegan dish or two for him in the spirit of hospitality, but that's for your family to decide. \n\nRegardless, good on y'all for keeping Cajun culture alive, and Happy Thanksgiving!", "So he went to Portland for Thanksgiving instead of crapping all over yours again?\n\nSounds like everyone won here. \n\nNTA.", "If this is a typical, normal Thanksgiving tradition, honestly don\u2019t see a problem here.  As a guest, he should take effort to immerse himself in the culture.\n\nI married into a culture different from my own, and if there\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand: I ask.  And by the sounds of it, the effort would be made to talk directly to him in English.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful thing to share a family tradition.\n\nI\u2019m going with Not.", "NTA. The guy acts entitled and your sis supports him in this.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not entitled to be spoken to, and participate, when you do not know a language. The reason you learn languages **IS** to participate. \n\nTake it from someone whose various family connections speak 5 languages together regularly (English, Danish, German, French, Spanish), and soon to be a 6th (Dutch) with a marriage in the family. I don\u2019t speak Spanish or Dutch, but it motivates me to learn if I will be in regular proximity to them, and I want to be present and around for the kids who will eventually come along and will speak these languages. \n\nThe fact that your sister\u2019s boyfriend cannot extend the same work to participate in her/your family, and on top of that expects for **you** to cater to him as the only non-Francophone, is the HEIGHT of arrogance on his part. It also shows a clear lack of disrespect for your identity and traditions, that someone who is maybe going to marry in is going to flagrantly deny the importance of your guys\u2019 history. Maybe your sister doesn\u2019t value it, but if your sister\u2019s boyfriend wants a relationship with you guys, he should be working to participate in front of you guys, not the other way around.\n\nBonne travail avec la d\u00e9fense de votre culture! \ud83d\ude01", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t understand all the YTA.", "I was on the fence until the vegan turkey just for him.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nI recently visited my wife\u2019s family on the other side of the planet. I don\u2019t speak the language, they speak a local dialect of an obscure language so it\u2019s not one that appears on Duolingo or online courses anywhere. I told them not to worry about catering to me as the occasion was more about her catching up with her family and dealing with the stress of our upcoming wedding so I wasn\u2019t taking onboard the few phrases they were trying to teach me. We managed though, even the oldies and I managed to get along pretty well and the wedding went as smoothly as could be expected. \n\nPushing his politics onto and demanding others make adjustments is major A-hole behaviour. Once you start giving ground he\u2019ll start insisting on more concessions.", "Why bother appeasing someone you don't like? You're not the asshole.", "I'd also go for NTA\n\nAs you mentioned, you don't speak french on a daily basis or anything. You do it to keep your culture and heritage alive on this holiday. I feel like this is a truly special, emotional and personal matter. My vote comes from the understanding that you don't do this to spite him but rather to enjoy and celebrate your family. Even though you may not like him, this rule isn't installed to exclude him. It's just a very culturally relevant tradition and if he values his girlfriend he should also value her family and culture.", "ESH\n\nI get why you want to speak French. With your family is the only time you get to. And your grands aren't so hot with English. \n\nSo, you have someone who doesn't speak French and people who don't speak great English. \n\nIt's actually perfectly doable to have the conversations of the day in a mix of both. Speak French when directly or mainly with your grands, and sis can translate for BF. Speak English for at least some ofthe general conversation and translate for the grands. \n\nYou shouldn't refuse to accomodate a guest at all,  even if you think he's a pretentious snob.\n\nYour sister should make the effort to translate some of the time rather than tell everyone to switch when it will leave your grandparents out.\n\nHe should stop whinging about Louisiana and bring his own vegan food, def out of line to demand a vegan turkey.", "As someone from a multi-lingual household, sorry but YTA. He sounds insufferable, yes, but choosing to be exclusionary by speaking a language he doesn\u2019t understand is an AH move. It\u2019s isolating and rude to purposefully leave him out from wider conversations. You don\u2019t owe him friendship, but you owe your sister civility. \n\nI do think speaking to your grandparents in French *and then translating* for him would be fair. But if you don\u2019t want him there just say so. Keep in mind that how you treat him will be determine your relationship with your sister moving forward, especially if they last long-term.", "Vegan Turkey in Louisiana... Hard NTA. Go full Cajun on tofu boy.", "NTA. As soon as you said that he's a vegan, I knew that he's the problem.", "YTA\n\nI grew up in a multilingual house and what you\u2019re suggesting is something my family would consider extremely rude. If you don\u2019t like someone, don\u2019t invite them. Having them over and excluding them from the overall conversation is pretty despicable. You can\u2019t justify your rudeness by pointing out his flaws.", "YTA\n\nYou all seem to be acting in a *very* judgmental way toward this young man.  \n\nYeah, I see why your sister doesn't want to subject herself or someone she loves to this.", "YTA\n\nIf you don\u2019t want him in your house, fine. But have the guts to just uninvite him then. \n\nUsing a second language to exclude a person is such an AH move. You don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s pretentious and somewhat disrespectful, and you answer that with being disrespectful? Not cool. \n\nI hope your sister has a good thanksgiving in Portland.", "NTA", "YTA. My family and I speak our own dialect. We would never only speak that with my bf around. That\u2019s extreme rude because we would exclude him on purpose. The only reason one would use it is to say something he\u2019s not supposed to hear but not something related to him", "YTA you are purposely excluding him unless directly speaking to him, thats just incredibly rude\n\nHe is your families guest even if you dont like him even though he is acting a little snobby", "YTA, glad to see Thanksgiving being exclusive and judgemental.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is it rude to exclude a dinner guest from participating in any conversation? Maybe you find him rude too, but as my grandmother used to say \"two wrongs don't make a right.\"\n\nOf course, my grandmother was a miserable, bitter wretch who acted like all the wrongs made her right, so who knows.", "I think it's hilarious that you refer your Cajun as French. Although it's based off French originally,  it's definitely it's own language now. You have to be Cajun to speak or understand it.", "You all seem to be acting in a very judgmental way toward this young man.", "And maybe to reframe it a bit\u2026.  Here in the US, at least, there seems to be a huge emphasis on being a gracious host, but there\u2019s also a duty to be a gracious guest.  And that\u2019s something that I sense has been kinda lost over time.\n\nIt\u2019s a balance.", "So it's okay to plan ahead the exclusion of the grandparents and great grandparents?  His girlfriend could translate for him, she just doesn't want to.   She would rather the rest of the family is left to take care of the grandparents and great grandparents while she and her boyfriend have a carefree time.", "Did you not read the entire post? There are people coming who don\u2019t speak and understand English well. So a swath of the family should be excluded from conversation?", "The issue is that the grandparents don't speak English - so either the grandparents can't communicate or the boyfriend can't - someone is always going to be unable to understand.", "Yes but the guest seems to want everyone to accommodate to him. That's unbalanced and the fact they want a vegan turkey is absurd just eat whatever isn't meat if that is the case.", "I\u2019ve been in this situation before and my family handles it by translating for whoever doesn\u2019t speak that language (so either for BF, or the grand/great grandparents). Its not like everyone is going to be sat in the same room for the whole night, if boyfriend/grandparents aren\u2019t involved in that specific conversation or are in another room they can speak whatever language they want. It\u2019s not black and white. I teach kindergarten internationally and my students speak up to four languages. Not everyone speaks English well and not everyone speaks the local language (Arabic). If my kindergarteners can work together and translate for each other, surely these grown ass adults can too.", "Oh I missed the grandparents. Then the sister\u2019s bf is the asshole", "Exactly. A few people in my family have been vegetarian or vegan at various points. When vegan we make sure there\u2019s a few dishes they can still eat (though they usually made an exception for butter on that day) and they brought a vegan meat or tofu and cooked it up quick. When they\u2019ve been vegetarian it\u2019s easier and we make sure there\u2019s no meat in any of the sides and they still brought a \u201cmeat\u201d for themselves. \n\nIt\u2019s not really a reasonable request you make for everyone to have vegan turkey because you\u2019re vegan.", "Except this is for a very long meal where everyone will be sat around a large table for hours.  There will indeed be one main conversation.", "Where there is goodwill among all parties, my experience of situations like this is that the conversation  - even the main conversation - switches between languages with the ebb and flow of who's involved or what they're talking about, and people translate for others when needed. \n\nIt's a little bit of effort but it's not actually hard when everyone comes with an attitude of openness and doesn't freak out that they can't understand every word that is said, and just accepts that they're in a multi lingual conversation.", "And my kids are in school for 8 hours of the day, five days a week. It\u2019s kindergarten and inquiry based, my lessons are 10-20 minutes long each and the rest is just conversation and teamwork. Side conversations happen, especially in large groups. They\u2019ll all be fine.", "Comparing situations between 15 to 20 five year olds to one table of adults is not helpful.  Five year olds will play with anyone and anything and can be lead or directed in any direction.   They will also accept not understanding what's going on to a much higher degree than adults.  And part of kindergarten is them learning to sit still and accept boring tasks.  What does that have to do with Thanksgiving supper?  Nothing.  This is not a \"multilingual\" situation.  There are two languages only.  Either the boyfriend can have things translated for him, or the grandparents and great grandparents.   The family is speaking a minority language where opportunities are thin in that language.   It is important for the family to keep their language and culture and this supper is one of the few opportunities they will have all year to do that."]}
