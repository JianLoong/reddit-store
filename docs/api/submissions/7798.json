Your sister can\u2019t dictate your trauma and she has no right making demands. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, OP.", "NTA. your sister acknowledged that you experienced trauma yet failed to understand that not everyone heals the same. do what you have to do, you have every right to not go. i get that it\u2019s a huge deal for her, but going back to your hometown is a huge deal for you. the wedding won\u2019t be ruined if you\u2019re not there, she can get over it.", "NAH\n\nBut you may have PTSD. I do- albeit not due to a natural disaster. Therapy and EMDR are highly beneficial.", "NTA - She's asking you to return to a place where you were traumatized.  You aren't an AH for not going, she isn't an AH for asking, but she is being an AH for not being understood of why you can't go.", "NAH\n\nYou're not ready to return, she is. I would leave this conversation to you and your trauma therapist.", "NTA- everyone is allowed to manage their own trauma on their own terms. If not visiting a place which triggers your anxiety is what you do to keep yourself healthy, then sister should respect that.", "NTA.\n\nThat was a traumatic event.  You seem to have healed enough to move on with your life but the trauma of the actual place is still there.  Your sister is wrong in that she went through it too and has healed so you should too.  Her journey is not your journey.\n\nShe wants you at her wedding and you advised you cannot do it as it would jeopardize your mental health.  She doesn't want to understand because she wants what she wants.\n\nGo if you feel able.  Don't if you don't feel able.  Your mental health is most important.", "NTA. Nobody can tell how you feel except you. If you don\u2019t think you can go back there then you shouldn\u2019t push yourself. If you aren\u2019t getting therapy you can try that and see if it works out for you. I wish you the best.", "NTA You still have a lot of trauma regarding that location.  In order to protect your mental health you are staying away, whether you ever end up returning to that area at all should be up to you.", "NTA.\n\nOP's mental health trumps sisters wedding.\n\nHopefully, OP is working with a therapist and can get some help with this trauma.\n\nBest of luck to OP.", "NTA and this is almost above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. OP, I\u2019m so fucking sorry for your losses. I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019ve gone through. I send you love, support and healing vibes. (I live in earthquake country too).", "NAH. You don't have to go through the trauma if you don't want to but at the same time, your sister can have her wedding wherever she wants and it is not really a bad thing for her to expect you to be at the wedding. Sometimes, things just don't line up and that's okay\n\n\nHowever, it looks like you've actually not worked through your trauma and might need more therapy, because you can't escape something like a tremor (natural or otherwise) forever nor can you escape going to your hometown forever", "Obviously you haven't worked through all of your pain and over it since you can't bring yourself to go and walk your sister down the aisle. You had a traumatic experience, that's understandable as you've lost someone you loved. but to truly face it often times returning to it to truly expunge it. There aren't too many if any at all that's not subject to some type of natural disaster.\n\nNTA for just not wanting to go for your reasons but your sister needs you.", "NTA\n\nSorry for you loss.\nYou aren't AH.  Don't go back to this place. You went on in life ad best as possible. You can be proud on that. No need to go back to your past. Your sister seems to be very unempathic to not understand this. Even I as a foreigner can not understand why she is choosing this area that is connected to so much negative emotions. That's maybe her way to grieve but did she also lost her partner there? It's a huge difference to lose a house or also a beloved person", "\"(she) called me an AH\"\n\nYou are NTA.", "\" I worked very hard on myself to get to acknowledge my pain and overcome it\"   \n\n\nIf you cant go back for what is obviously a VERY big deal for your sister, you havnt overcome anything.   \n\n\nI want to give you a soft YTA.

Ahhh I\u2019m an asshole \n\nIdk OP is it worth ruining the relationship with your sister over? Only you can answer that.  She thinks you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t go.  That\u2019s really all that matters here outside your own feelings", "NTA - trauma is a legit reason not to go to a wedding. I'm sorry you lost so much, and I'm happy you made so much progress.

I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA", "NTA\nYou do what you need to do to take care of yourself. There is no set timetable for this. I hope you'll be able to put it behind you at some point but if for now you can't, then you can't.", "NTA - I do have a question though. Is she asking you to stay in town for days or just for the day? Would that make the difference for you? To just go for the wedding long enough to walk her down the isle, have the reception maybe then leave? I\u2019m sorry for what you had to go through.", "If you end up deciding to go back there, becarful when you pee don't shake your dick too much", "Agreed. NAH. Sister isn\u2019t wrong to ask him to walk her down the aisle in the country where they grew up, and she even has some right to feel hurt that he won\u2019t attend. She\u2019s probably realizing she may never see her brother on home soil again and that has to sting. \n\nOP is definitely not wrong for not wanting to return to a place that has caused heart-rending trauma. To lose your beloved, your home and your pet is almost too much to bear. \n\nOP, I hope you are in counseling because something else may trigger you, and you need tools in place just in case. Good luck to you and hopefully your sister will put her wedding on Zoom for you.", "Exactly the sister needs to understand this wedding is about op not herself", "Overcoming something doesn\u2019t mean you have to put yourself in that position again. \n\nYou don\u2019t ask domestic violence victims to \u2018overcome their past\u2019 by becoming friends with their abusers, or ask those with combat-induced PTSD to go back into war zones, or ask hurricane katrina survivors to go to the beach or the French quarter. \n\nYou overcome trauma when you can live your day-to-day life without negative ramifications because of trauma responses. OP is living in a home, sleeping well, and able to form/keep up social relationships. They clearly have worked hard on themselves\u2019, they\u2019re doing just fine, and it\u2019s absolutely valid not to return someone you associate with trauma. \n\nIn fact; a pretty big sign that he has worked on himself is that he\u2019s able to respectfully decline the invitation, rather than become agitated and overly worried that someone he cares about will be going to that area.", "If that\u2019s the case, the sister should have even more understanding of why he won\u2019t come to the wedding. Whether he has overcome the pain or not by moving to a different city, going back to the town will clearly open up old wounds. He has no obligation to intentionally make himself suffer like that", "Wow. Your standard of Healed is inhumanly impossibly high.", "No the sister is definitely TA because she literally told him she went through the same thing and to get over it\u2026", "I don't understand this comment? OPs' sister can choose any location she wants. And she did. But she can't force others to visit this traumatic place.", "NTA. And she is not being considerate of your well-being here.  just because she feels ok being there, does not mean you are the same as her.\nI am sorry you cannot get her to understand how you feel.", "NTA \n\nINFO: your sister claims she had the same fears. Did she lose her SO, her pet and her home as well? Or is she talking out of her ass to downplay your trauma?", "NTA.\n\nYour sister doesn't understand trauma, and 7 years isn't \\*that\\* long ago when it comes to grief and pain.\n\nTotally fine not to go.", "Yeah, but to have it actually be a healing experience, it should be something they do under their own choice, in their own time, with the support of a mental health professional. The sister begging them to go for a specific event (which will come with a bunch of obligations, and be hard to step back from if OP does get overwhelmed) is not it."]}
