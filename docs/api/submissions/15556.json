This didn\u2019t go down well but SIL just looked huffy and took him outside (My bridesmaid is a QUEEN). \n\nAfter the wedding while taking photos in the church ground, John was running around the grounds uncontrolled. He kept jumping into the frame, ruining photos and My husband said to his sister multiple times to control him. She vaguely told him \u201cbe good sweetie\u201d then ignored him. Eventually he came running up to me from behind while I was taking a photo and slapped me on my behind with both hands - I heard my Mum gasp and realised John had mud all over him and had left black muddy hand prints all over my dress and veil. \n\nI was devastated - we were supposed to go for a post wedding photo shoot afterwards while walking around London but I was too embarrassed. We ended up going straight to the reception venue and tried to clean me off but it was hopeless - after our meal I ended up changing into a dress I brought for the next day. I couldn\u2019t cry - I just felt sick. \n\nI know it sounds stupid saying the day was ruined - because ultimately I was so happy to marry my husband, and I know it was just a dress but we worked so hard to pay for the wedding we wanted and I just feel/felt so defeated. \n\nMy SIL looked shocked when it initially happened but didn\u2019t apologise. She just took James aside and later came up to me and tried to make a joke of it saying \u201cboys will be boys\u201d. \n\nAt that point I told her to leave - genuinely if she had come up to me and apologised genuinely I would have let it go but the fact that she didn\u2019t even pretend to be sorry I saw red and told her to \u201cGet the F*** out of my wedding\u201d. She sobbed and left. \n\nMy mum took my dress to a cleaners for me the next day but it can\u2019t be saved - so I sent my SIL the bill for the attempted cleaning and the total cost of the dress and veil (\u00a32338 in total).\n\nMy husband is in complete agreement with me - but I\u2019m having second thoughts now because she is a single mum and that\u2019s a lot of money for her.

I've been accused of being too harsh with my kids but at least they knew how to behave in public.  Yes, there was one wedding that they attended when they were young, yes, they ran around outside the church, but not once did they go anywhere near other guests and certainly didn't go close to the bride.  And they sat quietly throughout the church service.", "NTA. Your SIL is the worst kind of parent period. Paying the the bill is least of things she can do to try to mend the situation.

Take that \"but she's a single parent\" out of the equation.  She is a parent and is responsible for her child's actions... period.", "NTA: The saying \"boys will be boys\" is outdated. Parents need to teach their children to take responsibility for their actions. Whilst understandable their were no previous actions by the kid to stop him from coming his mom should have made sure he was on his best behavior and to correct any bad behavior and explain why it's not okay.

At The age of four you are definitely learning what is and is not appropriate, and smacking mud onto people (Especially at an event like a wedding) is something that you should definitely have taught your child not to do by the age of four.

For example: We have a dog and if my dog jumped up on her and muddied her clothes I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to apologise and to offer to pay for them to be cleaned or replaced. I\u2019m just expecting the same courtesy - and if she had apologised and offered in the first place I probably would have declined.", "Edit: I meant to write 2 cos I have a 2 yr old nephew so I know how 2 yr olds are little terrors who don't listen", "There\u2019s deffo evidence - we were taking a photo of me and my parents when he ran up to me. The photographer was taking multiple shots of us laughing and there\u2019s three short of him running at me with his hands full of mud and of him touching me. It\u2019s like a terrible flip chart of the moment my wedding was ruined.", "It only makes sense if the parent is absent tho.", "Just because you have second thoughts on something doesn't necessarily mean that it's wrong or that it wouldn't make you feel good to do it. It just means that you're questioning whether or not you're making the right decision and you're looking at all of the evidence to support it before pulling the ripcord. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Making sure that you are 100% secure in your decision before you actually make it, or before you do something you can't take back, is not a wrong thing.\nBut ultimately, given that this woman is a single mother she should be even more diligent in making sure that her kid doesn't ruin expensive ass things, considering she probably can't afford to pay for it easily. That's what my mom did. She made sure that me and my sister didn't break s*** she couldn't afford. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "Not saying you're wrong exactly - but in that example she would wear the clothes again.  Are you planning on buying another dress, or is this just a fine?", "Okay, and you still don't get a pass for your kid being a terror at the age of two. At the age of two it's definitely appropriate to be teaching them what to and to not do. Once again, you don't get a pass on your kid being a terror just because they're under a certain age.\nAnd if those 2-year-olds don't listen, then they don't get to go to fancy events like weddings and what not. I know I wouldn't invite kids who are like that. If you would want to deal with it then that's on you, but I sure as hell wouldn't. \nI don't reward bad behavior like that.", "And I mention this only because I also have a nephew, and when he was 2 years old he was beginning to act out but I wasn't ok with that around me. I didn't let him get away with it. And now whenever he's with me at least (as far as I know he behaves pretty well for his parents too) he's pretty well behaved at 5 years old. He doesn't go around slapping mud on people's fancy dresses.", "Take her to small claims court. She needs to learn how to parent her child.  I also wouldn't invite her or her son to anymore functions you are hosting until she starts making restitution and showing that she is parenting her child better", "i'm just answering their question, that's all", "In that example she wouldn't necessarily be wearing the clothes again, it was never Express what clothes could potentially be ruined. Could be a wedding, could be a fancy event, could be them just sitting in their backyard. Either way, doesn't matter whether you would wear the clothes again or not. The point is being a decent person, and her sister isn't. That's all there is to it here. Whether or not OP is going to wear the dress again, is not the topic of discussion and so it shouldn't even be considered in your judgment."]}
