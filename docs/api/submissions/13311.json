I make 120k and my husband makes 80k. I've gone from counting literal pennies because my budget was that tight, to not having to worry about buying anything we need.\n\nSo at work, when my boss offered me a Program Manager position, but said that my salary would be reviewed at the next review cycle... I went and got a drink with the guy who has that job now, and the guy who had the job before him. The current guy said he was screwed out of a raise, he took the promotion when it was implied one was coming and it never came. And the guy before him?  He was making less than I am currently in the role and kept getting his requests for raises rejected.\n\nThat night, I told my husband about my day, and how I wasn't sure if I should take the promotion. We talked a bit, and he thought I should, just for my resume. \n\nThe next morning, I asked my boss what the salary for the promotion would be, and he said that it would be up to HR in the next review cycle. I'd heard that that tends to be the absolute minimum they can get away with - and honestly that role on the job market was valued at 150-180k so I'd be majorly undervalued. I was starting to think I'd have to be a sucker to take that offer.  \n\nSo I told my boss I was grateful to be considered, but I was not comfortable taking on any role until the terms of employment including compensation were more fully defined. He said his hands were tied - HR wouldn't renegotiate until the next quarter.\n\nI came home and told my husband I declined the promotion. And he was surprisingly mad about it; he said it was something we should have talked about instead of me just going on my own. And that I knew he didn't agree with me!\n\nI said that I knew my job, the financials weren't looking good, and you can't get water from a stone. And if I took that, I'd be doubling my workload for nothing. \n\nHe said I'd have something for my resume that'd let me negotiate a higher pay elsewhere, since it'd open up other management jobs for me. \n\nI said I liked being an individual contributor, I wouldn't enjoy management, so that wasn't something I cared about. \n\nHe said \"it's all about you, isn't it\" and was upset because we're married now and I was impacting both of our financial futures since I didn't want a \"hard job\" \n\nAnd that it was normal to take on additional responsibilities and then have a salary review- I just didn't know because I'm too young (27 to his 33) and have never been promoted since I job hop too much. \n\nI said it was an old-school way of thinking to slave away for free on the hope you'll be rewarded - I tried that at my first two jobs and that's why I quit! All it does is tells them you're cheap and gullible! He called me naieve and said I was too idealistic... \n\nAITA for declining the promotion?", "created_utc": 1679924480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123n9ld/aita_for_saying_no_to_a_promotion_im_newly/", "score": 852, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m a software engineer and I would hate being a PM. It\u2019s much more work, but it also is a completely different role. I wouldn\u2019t call it a promotion; it\u2019s a different job. \n\nYour husband could switch careers and make more than 80k if your (quite high!) combined income isn\u2019t enough. The only difference is that you were directly offered this position rather than seeking it out. It\u2019s a nice cherry on top that it\u2019s a shitty offer.", "NTA. His reaction is bizarre. You absolutely should not be taking on more responsibility without adequate compensation. Honestly, this is kinda a weird way of doing it.  I don't think it's even legal in my country.\n\nYou were right to discuss it with your husband but ultimately it's 100% your decision.", "I\u2019d say NTA, it honestly does sound like the \u201cpromotion\u201d would leave you with a lot more work and less reward. You are married, so yeah you could have discussed it, but in the end it is YOUR job. You need to do the work every single day. You know what accepting would mean and he doesn\u2019t... accepting a job \u201cjust for a resume\u201d isn\u2019t really a good argument either.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not in any financial difficulties (quite the opposite it seems), you like your job, you don't like the idea of your new job. You talked to your husband and he gave his advice. You made your decision. None of that is AH behavior. \n\nWhat's important is that he doesn't get to make the decision for you. The decision is yours and yours alone. He should accept your decisions, within reason, and this decision couldn't be more reasonable. \n\nI guess your husband has that typical greedy individualisitic mindset that values the number of zeroes on a paycheck above quality of life, happiness and everything else. You clearly don't feel the same.", "NTA - your method of approach to this offer was correct .. when you called them out on the salary they had nothing to support and anyone\u2019s gut instinct would be to assume they\u2019d not give you a pay rise in-line with the extra responsibility.. actually I\u2019d suggest moving now because it sounds like a slightly unethical company for that reason .. you have an excuse if prospective companies (at interview stage) ask why", "NTA sounds like they want you to do extra work but not compensate you financially for it", "NTA, Sure it would look good on your resume but it comes with a lot of IFs. Like IF you\u2019re able to get another job somewhere else. That\u2019s a risky move. It outweighs the reward because you\u2019ll be doing double the work for inadequate pay. You know for a fact what the job will be like because you talked to people who did take the promotion. YOU have to do your job not your husband.", "NTA\n\nYou are the one doing the job so only you get final say. I could understand your husband being upset if you hadn't talked to him at any point but his anger because he disagrees with your decision is very worrying.", "NTA why work more if you get paid the same?", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like there would be any reward for what you say will be double the work. Your husband should be able to understand that. Yes, he\u2019s got a point that you could negotiate elsewhere, but if you don\u2019t want that type of job, you won\u2019t be happy. Money isn\u2019t everything. He should be able to understand that.", "NTA. That was a really shit offer. More work, more responsibility and the same pay? \n\nI don't know why he reacted that way but he needs to stay in his lane. This was absolutely your call.", "NTA.\n\nI was a software developer for over 30 years. You can earn upwards of 10 times what a program manager earns. That short term bump in salary will cost you.", "NTA - Not only is your reasoning super sound given the situation, but you'd still be NTA if it was a huge raise. You're the one who has to do your job, five days a week, every week, every year, until you retire. It's not a bad thing to want a job you enjoy, or at least don't hate. Honestly though, his attitude about the whole thing is super gross. I could see him being upset if you just up and quit your job without something new lined up, but this is YOUR career, you need to do what's best for you, not him. It's actually somewhat ironic to me that he'd accuse you of not wanting to work harder to make more money, when it seems that he wants you to take the job so that the two of you can have more money without him having to work any harder. NTA.", "NTA.  In addition to the \"We'll pay you later\" BS, you seem to know what you like.  Even if you do get a raise, is it worth it to do something that you don't enjoy?  At 200K combined, it's not like you are hurting financially.  Whether it's CEO or entry level admin, if you're happy where you are, you shouldn't feel the need to climb the ladder if it would make you unhappy.", "NTA and your husband is out of line. Yes, you probably should talk to him before you do something more drastic like, for example, look for a completely job that might have a big salary change. But no, you do not have to talk to him before having a discussion with your own boss about a potential promotion and its salary. You definitely are doing the smart thing by being firm in your salary requirements for what would be a much harder job. \n\nOf course your husband wants you to make more money. He doesn't have to do anything and he expects that it will then become his money. This is a bit concerning, honestly. Do you think he cares more about your earning a higher income than your own happiness at work?", "Your career is your and yours only.\n\nIf you are interested in the role, maybe you should have taken it and then leave the job for another one, but ultimately the choice is your, and maybe this doesn't even interest you.\n\nHow would your husband react if you directed his career ?\n\n*\"it's all about you, isn't it\"*\n\nAbsolutely, it is. That's your job and more than 8 hrs a day, it's about you and you only. Your husband is an idiot and contradict himself, he can't call you naive when he is dumb enough to expect a raise after accepting a raise-less promotion.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  But it was nice of your husband to mansplain how careers work/s", "NTA\nIf they want you to do more work right now they need to pay you more now.\n\nAlso as far as the \"It's all about you...\" yes it's YOUR career.", "NTA, my friend's wife went through something similar. She was being offered a partnership at the firm she was working at, buy after taking a closer look at the agreement, it definitily seemed like she was taking on not only more work, but also more liabilities and for not that much money. It seemed like a mock promotion/offering so she declined.", "NTA so he's not wrong about the resume part. However any promotion without a pay bump isn't a promotion. You guys talked and came to a conclusion but you're the one in the room, the one that knows the company, and he should have backed your decision. \n\nChance are you'd have had more responsibilities. Worked more hours. For the same pay. Which is basically a negative for your family.", "NTA dude needs to respect your decision. I\u2019ve been in similar situations were the promotion and increase were not worth it.", "Nta - using his age against you is gross. Trying to control YOUR career is gross. You can *discuss* your career with your husband but ultimately that decision is on you. And honestly I bet if your workload doubled and you were stressed, he'd be unsympathetic. Hopefully he's not usually like this.", "NTA\n\nOnly going by your testimony it seemed like a quick an easy way to give yourself more work for no extra benefit. If your boss could assure you a raise or something for the new position that would be different but seeing how he couldn't answer the question at all is suspect.\n\nI have potential for a raise at my job if I get promoted to a higher position. My boss just flat out...told me. I don't know why yours couldn't.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is out of line. This would've impacted you all majorly and the finances didn't add up. Added stress on you with potentially more hours which means less time with your husband. Does he not see that having a job is more than just money? It sounds like he may be greedy. You're making $120K a year and are still very young. You have plenty of time to move up the corporate ladder if thats what YOU choose. The only way it would impact him is if you took a pay cut or had to relocate. Otherwise, his choice is just an opinion and he should swallow his pride and let you make the decision.", "Nta. Your job, your decision.", "NTA. You have to do your job, not him; it's up to you and only you if you want a promotion (that clearly sounds like a bad deal). It's of course expected that you consult him, which you did, but not that you do what he wants.\n\nYour partner should actually stand for you if you want to take a less paying, more gratifying job,and that's not even the case.", "NTA. Your job is not up for debate with your husband. If you were going to take something that required him to move, or something like that, then yes it should be discussed; or if you were going to stop working and rely on his income. But within the basic parameters of your continuing to produce for the household at the expected level, it's your business whether you accept promotions, or how you handle negotiating for raises. Not his.", "NTA, as you\u2019re the one who\u2019d have to work more for no extra pay", "NTA.\n\nI like your thought process.\n\nWish I was an intelligent as you and not slogged so much for peanuts!!!", "Doesn\u2019t sound like much of a \u201c promotion \u201c.", "NTA\n\nIt's not only about compensation but also optimizing your own wellbeing. Something your husband should be interested in (and you in return). It would be a different conversation if you had a set plan and were tackling some dangerous debts together, or your health insurance depended on one of you having a more difficult job than you prefer. But that's not the case.\n\nPerhaps your husband is looking at your trajectory how how he would act in that situation (and taking an emotional toll) , but needs to accept that it's yours. Just like you can have a perspective on what he dies, but cannot be the one making a decision for him.", "NTA\n\nAs an HR Manager, I think you made the right decision. If they're refusing to discuss compensation with you, it would be a red flag for me.\n\nTo add to that, the discussions you had with the past two previous people in that role just reinforces what you were worried about.", "NTA \n\n1. It is none of of your husbands business as to what you do with your career\n2. Your position of declining the job because specifics aren\u2019t available seems a very reasonable and sound decision (I would do the same). \n3. If your company undervalues employees, perhaps a company which values you adequately is a better fit.", "OP is on the ball and approached it perfectly. I would say that there was a discussion and she got her husband's opinion and made the right decision for her. \n\nHope he clues in how smart she is and learns to trust her judgement. \n\nNTA", "NTA partner can have opinions for sure but at the end of the day you own your own career. They need to be supportive and acting like this decision is hurting them is a really selfish mentality to have", "NTA - play to your strengths.  If you don't want management don't do it.  When you do something you don't love, you end up being pretty bad at it and that can be the kiss of death for your career.  You are young and other promotions will come your way.  Wait for the one that sets your heart on fire.", "NTA!  I had a promotion at work and went from hourly with a company car to salary with no car.  I travelled a TON and did not make any OT.  After the pandemic I demoted myself back to my original position hourly with a car and OT and ended up making about $400-500 more per pay.\n\nGood on you for doing your due diligence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your marriage would likely suffer if you were miserable at work after taking a job your husband pushed you to take. \n\nYou absolutely did the right thing.

While it is appropriate to discuss the matter with your husband and to consider the impact on the family, it is STILL YOUR DECISION. Your husband is very focused on the fact that you would have a title change that MIGHT help you find another job. It is possible your career path could move in that direction. BUT (1) there are also several negatives to consider\\* and (2) in balancing the impacts on the household and on you personally, absent a huge negative impact to the household, your preference is priority. \\*You were not looking to change positions or employers. Taking this position with this employer seems likely to lead to greater job dissatisfaction without greater pay for you. You can't benefit from leaving to another employer for a while, and it was not something you are currently seeking to do anyway. On top of all that, if you are more harried/less satisfied with your job, that is likely to have a negative impact on the home-life, too.\n3. If your husband has a concern with the amount of money the family is bringing in, he is welcome to take steps to increase his contribution to the family. He is earning 20K less than you despite being 6 years older than you. I'm guessing that is because the profession/employer he chose just pays less, not because he is less capable of advancing his career. You are not telling him that he should change his position/employer so that he can earn another 30-50K /year. People who have been your exact same shoes are voicing their concerns; people with a lot more experience than your husband are voicing their concerns. Your husband may personally have felt stymied in advancing his career, but that does not make him more knowledgeable about what is best for your career. He said believes you are too young, naive and idealistic. He needs to see you as an equal partner in your lives together. He can share his perspective and personal experience, but he cannot assume he knows better than you about your own career.\n4. I don't think you career decision is a big concern.

You would have had to be a fairly high level person early on at a major tech company.

Once they have you in the role you have no leverage\n\n2. They can easily claim the HR review cycle or whatever limits her compensation or prevents a raise for whatever nonsense they want\n\n3.

It sounds like the boss has an opening to fill, but doesn't want to pay market rate to fill it.", "Right? She doesn't want a \"hard job\" when her current job is technical, presumably full of men, and *pays 120k*? My partner would be promoted to paying half the household expenses if they pulled this lol", "She doesn't want the job. She doesn't need to discuss that. It's not about anything besides the fact that she does not want to do that job. They are not in dire straights. This is not the difference between making rent or not. It's being asked to change careers and decided she doesn't want to. She already discussed it with him. It's her decision.", "I definitely got that vibe. OP is NTA for sure", "Okay, but first of all, OP did discuss it with him. She explained the factors involved that were making her not want to take the job. He offered a counter-argument, which she didn't find persuasive. He's just mad she didn't accept his counter-argument and do what he wanted. It's not like she hadn't even mentioned the situation to him or something.\n\nAnd secondly, while they may be married, I don't really think a decision about her career necessarily needs to involve them both. If their marriage breaks up somewhere down the line, her career goes with her. He doesn't. Unless it's the kind of career decision that's like...giving up your job entirely to go be a zebra herder in east Africa, where it would mean no longer being able to maintain your existing standard of living, I don't necessarily think career decisions need to be made jointly. (And before you brush that off as \"you're clearly not married or you'd understand\", I do talk with my partner of 13 years about career matters and he offers opinions, but when push comes to shove he understands it's my career, not his.)\n\nSo I agree it's not about the money, per se, but I think it's more about control and doing what he wants than about him not feeling included. Because I suspect to him, he wouldn't feel included no matter what she did unless she agreed with him and did what he thought she should do.", "I don\u2019t know - my wife thought I would be great at management (she was a manager in aerospace).\n\nShe said I had great people skills \u2014 and I do.

(Be understandable to be upset that she turned down a position which could increase her pay.) but at $200k combined income they don\u2019t NEED more. They\u2019re not struggling.

He\u2019s not even that much older or part of a different generation. To act like he has so much more age and experience is a bullshit attitude.", "She's 27 too. It's not like she's fresh out of school.", "If he thinks they need to earn more he is surely welcome to invest in his own professional success as well. He could retrain, even, and career hop.\n\nBut we all know he won't. OP is his mommy mcbangbucks. And he feels entitled to that, obviously, because he's trying to influence her choice.

Maybe I'm wrong. But in a marriage it should be a partnership. Yes, it's her job, but it's their life. I would be pissed if my husband made a job change without talking to me about it, even if it was the same amount. At least get everyone on the same page with the same info. I don't feel like that's unreasonable. Ultimately the final decision is hers and I think she made the right call, but it would have avoided a fight if they had had this final conversation before she said no.", "yep, and that was something to discuss and explain to her spouse before making that decision", "that's not how marriage works\n\nwe have plenty of stay-at-home wives in this sub, I'm sure you wouldn't be saying that they don't get a vote on their husband's job just because they don't make anything, so they need to \"shut up and sit down\" as your comment implies", "It will be because she\u2019s too new! I\u2019ve heard that one before, I moved to a new job internally with MANY more expectations, but no added compensation because it would be in the next review. Welp, in the next review, I was so new at that job we needed more time to determine a raise.", "I mean she\u2019s absolutely NTA, but it would let her lateral to another company a year or two later with that on her resume. Still she did nothing wrong but it does give some minor long term benefit.", "Wait for the one that sets your heart on fire.", " It seemed like a mock promotion/offering so she declined.", "I\u2019m also a PM with some technical background and work with the actual tech folks on projects. A little surprised people think PMs work harder than SEs lol. We are always the one getting social media flack for \u201cworking\u201d by the pool abroad for six figures a year. \n\nGuess it just depends on the work environment and what type of work people actually enjoy - if a SE thinks creating a sprint plan sucks then it makes sense they\u2019d think it\u2019s \u201cmore work\u201d than the stuff they actually enjoy doing? Idk!", "Agree, someone with that skillset would be better off as a Subject Matter Expert\n\nEdit:typo", "This sort of thing happens so often in all varieties of engineering. I work as a thermal engineer in aerospace and there are so many instances where good technical people get promoted to management and are absolute shit at the job because, like you said, it's an entirely different skill set.\n\nI'm happy continuing as a technical expert even if it means I won't ever \"maximize\" my income. I would much prefer to make less in a position I'm happier at and better suited for than to be promoted to a management position where I can make more money, but hate my fucking life.\n\nPromoting engineers to management positions who don't have management skills is such an epidemic in so many forms of engineering.", "I think there is a clear benefit to having some technical background for the Program you are managing. It prevents one from being out of touch with what is realistically feasible for committing to your upper management and for expectations on the team. \n\nI think hiring someone to manage a project, program, etc without any technical experience is a big miss and is where the stereotype of \"useless middle management\" can come from.", "My read was that she discussed it with him prior to getting all the info about HR & negotiation. After she gathered the info the next day, having another discussion before a final decision that affects both of them would be a positive for how one exists in a marriage.\n\nNone of that changes the fact that it is certainly her decision in the end.", "I guess I do think major decisions should be discussed with your spouse. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to do what they want but it\u2019s important to make them a part of such a thing.

So he should be going to OP for career advice, not the opposite.\n\nHusband is the AH however you slice it.\n\n(Edited out OP's gender because I don't think they said it?)", "Yup. Happened to me too.\n\nTook a job that was a significant raise in title and responsibilities with a promise of a big raise in the next review cycle. That was Jan 2020. COVID hit and I got nothing in the next cycle or the cycle after that (and then I left the company).\n\nSure COVID was a factor in not getting a raise, but if I had refused the job before getting a raise I would have been better off with the same pay but a much easier job.", "Yeah but there's a risk.\n\nA hypothetical long term benefit isn't necessarily worth taking on more work for free.", "I was also surprised people think PMs work harder than contributors.  From my perspective, PMs just keep up a list of deliverables and who they are assigned to and try to keep deliverables on track.  Is that wrong? Too simplified? I\u2019m genuinely curious because I\u2019ve considered a switch from project engineer to project manager.", "I\u2019ve been in tech for over 20 years and the 2 years I spent as a PM were some of the hardest of my life. It\u2019s a natural skills/personality thing. Code makes me calm, I understand how it works and seeing perfectly functioning architecture and clean data satisfies something in my soul. PMs have all responsibility and no authority. The sprint planning part isn\u2019t bad by itself. But PMs have to deal with all the exhausting communication bits.I\u2019d much rather spend my time \u201cthinking in 1s and 0s\u201d instead of being frustrated by nuanced communication in  English/human language.\n\nIn school they refer to being a PM as \u201cherding kittens\u201d for good reason. Some of us just aren\u2019t built for that. We\u2019d rather be the kittens.", "Exactly! She doesn\u2019t need his advice and we aren\u2019t hearing about him out there trying to get a promotion. I think this is less about her \u201cresume\u201d and more about his meal ticket.", "Aye. I guess I am just more risk prone, that was my entire career. Started as a dishwasher, got promoted to \u201cmanger\u201d for 8$ an hour instead of 7.25. Used that to transfer to another place that would pay me 15/hr a half a year later. Worked there and got promoted from shift manager to a \u201creal\u201d manager, not much pay increase but about a year later transferred somewhere else started making 22/hr. Eventually saved enough to finish college and go to law school.\n\nBut it\u2019s absolutely a risk. And in this economy there\u2019s always the possibility other places wouldn\u2019t be hiring and she would be stuck in her role.\n\nAs I said NTA at all, just there are some (theoretical) benefits.", "It\u2019s an incredibly broad generalization but I would say overall, yes. There\u2019s a great reply to my comment explaining the personality difference but overall, my job is not intellectually stimulating and I have to be fully in charge of my own career to pivot such ambiguous skills into some fancy strategy leadership role in the future. And I have some controversial opinions on the future of tech and how the SE role has changed dramatically over the past ten years as technology continues to evolve, so I\u2019m personally glad I did not go technical. \n\nAt the end of the day, most org leaders are not the deep tech guys who have been exclusively behind a computer screen the whole time turning in code. I don\u2019t mean to offend. Those leadership assholes are not better than anyone. But they eventually need to focus on managing people and strategy to get there, and they\u2019re pulling in the c-suite money. If that interests you more than becoming a principal engineer, who still builds things by hand as his book of work and makes plenty $, make the switch.", "You nailed it. If you find the required level of communication exhausting, then having space to produce code and be left alone would absolutely be a reprieve. My husband would rather quit than be forced to lead meetings. And being the kitten (someone chasing me for my code, who doesn\u2019t fully understand what I\u2019m doing but demands it by Friday) would absolutely piss me off. Different personalities. \n\nMy viewpoint is different though. I absolutely have authority, I determine strategy, I tell you what to produce and by when, I herd you. I don\u2019t mean that in an asshole power tripping way, my job is nothing without the tech folks actually making shit happen. But I\u2019ve always found the power dynamic very imbalanced as I typically have more face time with leadership showing off what the engineers are up to, but I absolutely work less, even in crunch periods. My job is simply less tangible in output and I really could take most meetings by the pool. The upside is my tech folks likely are getting paid more than me, as they deserve, but from my POV, at a greater personal cost."]}
