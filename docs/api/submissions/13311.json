I'm newly married and my husband is upset", "selftext": "\n\nI'm a software engineer and my husband works in construction management. \n\nI grew up broke af so honestly I feel like I'm loaded right now. I make 120k and my husband makes 80k. I've gone from counting literal pennies because my budget was that tight, to not having to worry about buying anything we need.\n\nSo at work, when my boss offered me a Program Manager position, but said that my salary would be reviewed at the next review cycle... I went and got a drink with the guy who has that job now, and the guy who had the job before him. The current guy said he was screwed out of a raise, he took the promotion when it was implied one was coming and it never came. And the guy before him?  He was making less than I am currently in the role and kept getting his requests for raises rejected.\n\nThat night, I told my husband about my day, and how I wasn't sure if I should take the promotion. We talked a bit, and he thought I should, just for my resume. \n\nThe next morning, I asked my boss what the salary for the promotion would be, and he said that it would be up to HR in the next review cycle. I'd heard that that tends to be the absolute minimum they can get away with - and honestly that role on the job market was valued at 150-180k so I'd be majorly undervalued. I was starting to think I'd have to be a sucker to take that offer.  \n\nSo I told my boss I was grateful to be considered, but I was not comfortable taking on any role until the terms of employment including compensation were more fully defined. He said his hands were tied - HR wouldn't renegotiate until the next quarter.\n\nI came home and told my husband I declined the promotion. And he was surprisingly mad about it; he said it was something we should have talked about instead of me just going on my own. And that I knew he didn't agree with me!\n\nI said that I knew my job, the financials weren't looking good, and you can't get water from a stone. And if I took that, I'd be doubling my workload for nothing. \n\nHe said I'd have something for my resume that'd let me negotiate a higher pay elsewhere, since it'd open up other management jobs for me. \n\nI said I liked being an individual contributor, I wouldn't enjoy management, so that wasn't something I cared about. \n\nHe said \"it's all about you, isn't it\" and was upset because we're married now and I was impacting both of our financial futures since I didn't want a \"hard job\" \n\nAnd that it was normal to take on additional responsibilities and then have a salary review- I just didn't know because I'm too young (27 to his 33) and have never been promoted since I job hop too much. \n\nI said it was an old-school way of thinking to slave away for free on the hope you'll be rewarded - I tried that at my first two jobs and that's why I quit! All it does is tells them you're cheap and gullible! He called me naieve and said I was too idealistic... \n\nAITA for declining the promotion?", "created_utc": 1679924480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123n9ld/aita_for_saying_no_to_a_promotion_im_newly/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m a software engineer and I would hate being a PM. It\u2019s much more work, but it also is a completely different role. I wouldn\u2019t call it a promotion; it\u2019s a different job. \n\nYour husband could switch careers and make more than 80k if your (quite high!) combined income isn\u2019t enough. The only difference is that you were directly offered this position rather than seeking it out. It\u2019s a nice cherry on top that it\u2019s a shitty offer.", "NTA. His reaction is bizarre. You absolutely should not be taking on more responsibility without adequate compensation. Honestly, this is kinda a weird way of doing it.  I don't think it's even legal in my country.\n\nYou were right to discuss it with your husband but ultimately it's 100% your decision.", "I\u2019d say NTA, it honestly does sound like the \u201cpromotion\u201d would leave you with a lot more work and less reward. You are married, so yeah you could have discussed it, but in the end it is YOUR job. You need to do the work every single day. You know what accepting would mean and he doesn\u2019t... accepting a job \u201cjust for a resume\u201d isn\u2019t really a good argument either.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not in any financial difficulties (quite the opposite it seems), you like your job, you don't like the idea of your new job. You talked to your husband and he gave his advice. You made your decision. None of that is AH behavior. \n\nWhat's important is that he doesn't get to make the decision for you. The decision is yours and yours alone. He should accept your decisions, within reason, and this decision couldn't be more reasonable. \n\nI guess your husband has that typical greedy individualisitic mindset that values the number of zeroes on a paycheck above quality of life, happiness and everything else. You clearly don't feel the same.", "NTA - your method of approach to this offer was correct .. when you called them out on the salary they had nothing to support and anyone\u2019s gut instinct would be to assume they\u2019d not give you a pay rise in-line with the extra responsibility.. actually I\u2019d suggest moving now because it sounds like a slightly unethical company for that reason .. you have an excuse if prospective companies (at interview stage) ask why", "NTA sounds like they want you to do extra work but not compensate you financially for it", "NTA, Sure it would look good on your resume but it comes with a lot of IFs. Like IF you\u2019re able to get another job somewhere else. That\u2019s a risky move. It outweighs the reward because you\u2019ll be doing double the work for inadequate pay. You know for a fact what the job will be like because you talked to people who did take the promotion. YOU have to do your job not your husband.", "NTA\n\nYou are the one doing the job so only you get final say. I could understand your husband being upset if you hadn't talked to him at any point but his anger because he disagrees with your decision is very worrying.", "NTA why work more if you get paid the same?", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like there would be any reward for what you say will be double the work. Your husband should be able to understand that. Yes, he\u2019s got a point that you could negotiate elsewhere, but if you don\u2019t want that type of job, you won\u2019t be happy. Money isn\u2019t everything. He should be able to understand that.", "NTA. That was a really shit offer. More work, more responsibility and the same pay? \n\nI don't know why he reacted that way but he needs to stay in his lane. This was absolutely your call.", "NTA.\n\nI was a software developer for over 30 years. You can earn upwards of 10 times what a program manager earns. That short term bump in salary will cost you.", "NTA - Not only is your reasoning super sound given the situation, but you'd still be NTA if it was a huge raise. You're the one who has to do your job, five days a week, every week, every year, until you retire. It's not a bad thing to want a job you enjoy, or at least don't hate. Honestly though, his attitude about the whole thing is super gross. I could see him being upset if you just up and quit your job without something new lined up, but this is YOUR career, you need to do what's best for you, not him. It's actually somewhat ironic to me that he'd accuse you of not wanting to work harder to make more money, when it seems that he wants you to take the job so that the two of you can have more money without him having to work any harder. NTA.", "NTA.  In addition to the \"We'll pay you later\" BS, you seem to know what you like.  Even if you do get a raise, is it worth it to do something that you don't enjoy?  At 200K combined, it's not like you are hurting financially.  Whether it's CEO or entry level admin, if you're happy where you are, you shouldn't feel the need to climb the ladder if it would make you unhappy.", "NTA and your husband is out of line. Yes, you probably should talk to him before you do something more drastic like, for example, look for a completely job that might have a big salary change. But no, you do not have to talk to him before having a discussion with your own boss about a potential promotion and its salary. You definitely are doing the smart thing by being firm in your salary requirements for what would be a much harder job. \n\nOf course your husband wants you to make more money. He doesn't have to do anything and he expects that it will then become his money. This is a bit concerning, honestly. Do you think he cares more about your earning a higher income than your own happiness at work?", "Your career is your and yours only.\n\nIf you are interested in the role, maybe you should have taken it and then leave the job for another one, but ultimately the choice is your, and maybe this doesn't even interest you.\n\nHow would your husband react if you directed his career ?\n\n*\"it's all about you, isn't it\"*\n\nAbsolutely, it is. That's your job and more than 8 hrs a day, it's about you and you only. Your husband is an idiot and contradict himself, he can't call you naive when he is dumb enough to expect a raise after accepting a raise-less promotion.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  But it was nice of your husband to mansplain how careers work/s", "NTA\nIf they want you to do more work right now they need to pay you more now.\n\nAlso as far as the \"It's all about you...\" yes it's YOUR career.", "NTA, my friend's wife went through something similar. She was being offered a partnership at the firm she was working at, buy after taking a closer look at the agreement, it definitily seemed like she was taking on not only more work, but also more liabilities and for not that much money. It seemed like a mock promotion/offering so she declined.", "NTA so he's not wrong about the resume part. However any promotion without a pay bump isn't a promotion. You guys talked and came to a conclusion but you're the one in the room, the one that knows the company, and he should have backed your decision. \n\nChance are you'd have had more responsibilities. Worked more hours. For the same pay. Which is basically a negative for your family.", "NTA dude needs to respect your decision. I\u2019ve been in similar situations were the promotion and increase were not worth it.", "Nta - using his age against you is gross. Trying to control YOUR career is gross. You can *discuss* your career with your husband but ultimately that decision is on you. And honestly I bet if your workload doubled and you were stressed, he'd be unsympathetic. Hopefully he's not usually like this.", "NTA\n\nOnly going by your testimony it seemed like a quick an easy way to give yourself more work for no extra benefit. If your boss could assure you a raise or something for the new position that would be different but seeing how he couldn't answer the question at all is suspect.\n\nI have potential for a raise at my job if I get promoted to a higher position. My boss just flat out...told me. I don't know why yours couldn't.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is out of line. This would've impacted you all majorly and the finances didn't add up. Added stress on you with potentially more hours which means less time with your husband. Does he not see that having a job is more than just money? It sounds like he may be greedy. You're making $120K a year and are still very young. You have plenty of time to move up the corporate ladder if thats what YOU choose. The only way it would impact him is if you took a pay cut or had to relocate. Otherwise, his choice is just an opinion and he should swallow his pride and let you make the decision.", "Nta. Your job, your decision.", "NTA. You have to do your job, not him; it's up to you and only you if you want a promotion (that clearly sounds like a bad deal). It's of course expected that you consult him, which you did, but not that you do what he wants.\n\nYour partner should actually stand for you if you want to take a less paying, more gratifying job,and that's not even the case.", "NTA. Your job is not up for debate with your husband. If you were going to take something that required him to move, or something like that, then yes it should be discussed; or if you were going to stop working and rely on his income. But within the basic parameters of your continuing to produce for the household at the expected level, it's your business whether you accept promotions, or how you handle negotiating for raises. Not his.", "NTA, as you\u2019re the one who\u2019d have to work more for no extra pay", "NTA.\n\nI like your thought process.\n\nWish I was an intelligent as you and not slogged so much for peanuts!!!", "Doesn\u2019t sound like much of a \u201c promotion \u201c.", "NTA\n\nIt's not only about compensation but also optimizing your own wellbeing. Something your husband should be interested in (and you in return). It would be a different conversation if you had a set plan and were tackling some dangerous debts together, or your health insurance depended on one of you having a more difficult job than you prefer. But that's not the case.\n\nPerhaps your husband is looking at your trajectory how how he would act in that situation (and taking an emotional toll) , but needs to accept that it's yours. Just like you can have a perspective on what he dies, but cannot be the one making a decision for him.", "NTA\n\nAs an HR Manager, I think you made the right decision. If they're refusing to discuss compensation with you, it would be a red flag for me.\n\nTo add to that, the discussions you had with the past two previous people in that role just reinforces what you were worried about.", "NTA \n\n1. It is none of of your husbands business as to what you do with your career\n2. Your position of declining the job because specifics aren\u2019t available seems a very reasonable and sound decision (I would do the same). \n3. If your company undervalues employees, perhaps a company which values you adequately is a better fit.", "OP is on the ball and approached it perfectly. I would say that there was a discussion and she got her husband's opinion and made the right decision for her. \n\nHope he clues in how smart she is and learns to trust her judgement. \n\nNTA", "NTA partner can have opinions for sure but at the end of the day you own your own career. They need to be supportive and acting like this decision is hurting them is a really selfish mentality to have", "NTA - play to your strengths.  If you don't want management don't do it.  When you do something you don't love, you end up being pretty bad at it and that can be the kiss of death for your career.  You are young and other promotions will come your way.  Wait for the one that sets your heart on fire.", "NTA!  I had a promotion at work and went from hourly with a company car to salary with no car.  I travelled a TON and did not make any OT.  After the pandemic I demoted myself back to my original position hourly with a car and OT and ended up making about $400-500 more per pay.\n\nGood on you for doing your due diligence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
