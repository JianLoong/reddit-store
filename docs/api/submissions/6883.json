That's not supportive at all.", "YTA\n\nMaybe he only felt comfortable discussing the extent of what was going on with his doctor. Male or female. You did invade his privacy.

Another self centered asshole justifying their selfishness by pretending you're doing it for him. Your husband explicity stated 'no' to your attendance but your jealously and selfishness decided no means yes to get what you want. Marriage does not justify you crossing a very clearly defined line.

You sound jealous and irrational, not to mention pushy. Major issues here.", "YTA just because he is your husband doesn\u2019t mean he is not entitled to privacy. Some of the most private things we do/and go through in life we go through/speak to our doctors about,how dare you invade that. I would be livid if my husband did that to me. The fact he told you know and you still did it means you have no respect for him or his boundaries. You seriously need to apologise and never do that again.", "YTA. First of all, you violated his privacy. Second of all, it sounds like you have some major insecurities you need to work through-so what if his doctor was a female?", "Yes, YTA. Omg!!!!!!

No question. He is entitled to privacy and you breached that big time. \n\nHave a think: if you were in his position and he walked in on a private doctors appointment that you had already told him you didn't want him at, you would be upset too.

Wow that's really messed up. He told you he didn't want you there, you should've respected his wishes. I would've been pissed if my hubby had done something like that.", "YTA. Where I live, what you did was illegal. They wouldn\u2019t have let you in since your husband didn\u2019t want you there. Everyone is entitled to medical privacy and you violated your husbands immensely. You owe him a huge apology and to stop being a nosy PITA. It\u2019s only helpful support if it is wanted. Otherwise it is just rude boundary stomping.", "YTA\n\nMost doctors won't give spouses medical info without a HIPAA waiver.\n\nHe *told* you he wanted privacy and you blatantly disregard his request.\n\nIt's not all about you.", "Holy hell, YTA without a doubt. What is actually wrong with you.", "Absolutely YTA. Your husband wanted privacy for medical appointments but because you're his wife you felt 'entitled' to attend without his permission? I'd have kicked you out of the appointment if it were me!", "YTA. You being his wife doesn't trump his right to privacy with his doctor. You didn't have good intentions and were not supportive like you think you were.", "YTA. Marriage doesn't mean he forfeits autonomy and privacy. The fact that you supposedly know what the issue is doesn't mean he didn't want privacy to discuss it, or that there wasn't something else he wanted to discuss with the doctor that you didn't already know. \n\nHe doesn't even need a reason anyway, privacy for a medical appointment is a pretty basic thing.", "Oh wow.. YTA without question. I feel sorry for your husband. He asked you for one thing (privacy) and you couldn\u2019t even grant him that. And so what if his Dr is female? Why is that even being brought up. If you think it\u2019s okay to insert yourself where you are not wanted you really need to take a hard look at yourself and work out why you feel so entitled. It\u2019s one thing to be concerned about you husbands health but tbh I think you went just to be nosey.", "YTA wow", "YTA ofc. Does he have any privacy in his life?", "YTA - He's a grown man and he has a right to privacy. I would have told my doctor not to talk to you about anything. He exists he didn't want you there so why'd you go? To actually see if his doctor was a woman? What do you think was happening if it were a woman?", "YTA - I would never do this with my fiance especially if he asked me not to.  Do you allow your husband to go to the bathroom alone?", "YTA. Unless you have reason to believe that he isn't telling his dr everything,  then there's no good reason to be there. And if that IS the case, then you tell the dr your concerns and gtfo so he can do the exam in privacy. He is an adult!", "YTA big times\n\nHe put up a (reasonable) boundary and you just walked all over it while laughing in his face and telling him he is probably cheating.\n\nStop searching for a reason for why it was ok to do what you did and start getting a hold of yourself.", "YTA, dude needs a new wife", "YTA. Anyone else surprised by the fact the doctor's office just let her in? Assuming this happened in the States, they could potentially be in violation of HIPAA.\n\nI attend my Dad's medical appointments but his doctors made sure it was okay with him first. If he told me to wait outside, I'd honor those wishes.", "YTA. In a relationship, no matter how strong you think it is, there are boundaries.\r  \n\r\n\nYour husband has clearly told you that he wants his privacy and wants to discuss things in private with an expert. There is nothing here that is that hard to understand. You voluntarily crossed that line and violated his trust and that's not okay.", "You must nitpick the hell out of him...was his appointment getting in the way of his honey do list?", "YTA. Consent still applies when you\u2019re married, and you didn\u2019t have consent to join his doctor\u2019s appointment.", "YTA. He asked for privacy, and you steam rolled him. You did EXACTLY what he said you did- overstepped his one boundary. Get over yourself.", "Yes you're the asshole. Boundaries. Your husband said no. No means no.", "YTA. Privacy hon. We all want it sometimes & it should be respected. After your comment about the doc being female, your turning up implies you don't trust him.", "YTA: Why did you go anyways? Is it because you suspected his doctor was a woman? Regardless if married, individuals deserve their privacy and their spouse should respect that, especially medical privacy.", "YTA I would\u2019ve kicked you out the room.", "YTA.  He's  right.", "YTA. Being married doesn't give you a free pass on ignoring boundaries. That was just disrespectful.", "YTA\n\nHe told you he wanted privacy. He explicitly stated he did not want you there. Regardless of how YOU feel about it, this is his health and he has a right to have that appointment on his own. You don't get to make that choice. You asked, and he said no - should have ended there. Big asshole move.", "YTA! you were just being nosy. Nothing about being supportive. My wife did that with my therapist  Booked the session right after mine then barged in halfway through mine and made it into a \"couples counselling session\" surprisingly the fool knew it would happen it seems and let it go on. Never went back", "YTA. It's not \"showing support\" to do something he explicitly said he didn't want you to. You ignored his privacy and ignored a clearly stated boundary. Apologize, and let the poor guy go to his doctors' appointments alone if he wants to. He's entitled to that.", "YTA", "When someone sets a boundary, you should respect it. Period. YTA.", "YTA. He deserves privacy. You have no sense of boundaries it seems. Are there other times when you think no means yes? \n\nSeriously,  he said no so that's it. Learn some freaking manners and stay home. It's his body, not yours.", "Yeh. Let the man have some privacy. Marriage doesn\u2019t mean you have to invade every aspect of his life.  If what ever he\u2019s dealing with is life threatening I\u2019m sure he would tell you his way.  Not by you forcing your way into the office", "If he wanted you there he would of asked you to come. You also sound really insecure and you weren\u2019t there to support him but more so wanting to catch him out with a female doctor. YTA", "YTA\n\nnasty and inconsiderate person who has no respect for anyone else\n\nget over yourself.", "YTA. Support is doing what you\u2019re asked to do with regards to the health issues. Not what makes YOU feel better. You\u2019re not required to give up all sense of self when you get married. So if he wants to deal with some portion of this on his own he\u2019s allowed to.", "YTA\n\nThere is absolutely no room for doubt here.\n\nYou don't respect this man one tiny bit. He must be cheating with the doctor. That's what you thought, because you cannot even imagine that HE has a right to HIS INFO and to do his tests etc in privacy!!!\n\nGood lawd OP, do you have children? You must be doing a real number on them if you do!", "YTA, big time. You took his privacy, his autonomy, and his ability to trust you, threw them in a dumpster and set them on fire. \n\nYou\u2019ve shown that you feel that a mere suspicion of yours has more right to be addressed than his most intimate fears and boundaries. This is an extreme violation. And the fact that you can\u2019t see that you\u2019ve been TA here is incredible. \n\nAnd on top of everything you\u2019ve shown him you don\u2019t trust him. Has he ever given you a reason not to?\n\nJust\u2026 yikes.", "YTA, obviously. It's clear from what you wrote that concern for his health wasn't the reason you insisted on following him to the doctor's office. You thought he was cheating on you with a female doctor. That's a high level of distrust and paranoia that you should address in yourself. Even if concern for his health had been the true reason, he still didn't want you to be there and that should have been reason enough for you to stay away.", "YTA please do not treat your spouse like a child especially when they are BEGGING you for an ounce of respect and boundaries. I expect you have a long road ahead rebuilding your husband\u2019s trust in you.", "YTA.\nNo is a full sentence. \n\nIf you said no and he pushed it would be totally different pov from you. \n\nNo matter what, and no matter when NO MEANS NO.", "Yta. Where are your trust issues coming from?", "YTA. You absolutely violated your husbands boundaries, ignored his wishes and possibly made him trust you less in the future. Why? Because you\u2019re insecure? You\u2019re acting like a high school kid. Ew.", "You are the AH! Also, a huge red flag for hubby to get out NOW. I am a very private person when it comes to health care. I prefer to go to Drs appointments by MYself. If I have surgery I want NO ONE at the hospital. They can visit later.
