My husband suggested that it would be a good idea to do Dry January following this heavier drinking period, and I agreed.\n\nEarlier this week my sister hosted a dinner at a nice restaurant for her birthday (my husband couldn't come because he had a work deadline). My sister doesn't drink in general, and the full group (about 8 people) consisted of either nondrinkers or people doing Dry January, so my sister ordered a couple rounds of fancy mocktails for everyone, which we enjoyed a lot.\n\nWhen I later told my husband about how the dinner went, he was angry at me for having mocktails and said it violated the spirit of Dry January to have an alcohol substitute, instead of drinking standard nonalcoholic beverages like water, club soda or iced tea. I have never done Dry January before and didn't realize this - I thought the point was literally to give one's body a break from actual alcohol. \n\nHe insists that I am an AH because we were doing this special health-related initiative together in Dry January and I broke our agreement. However - I really didn't know that you are supposed to give up mocktails as well during Dry January and we had never discussed that. I do know that mocktails can be a trigger for, well, people who actually have alcohol use disorder, but that isn't the case here - again my husband and I only drink once or twice a month, for a max of two drinks on each occasion.\n\nAs additional info, I know mocktails can have a lot of sugar/calories just like mixed drinks; however, my husband and I are both slim and fit with no health issues whatsoever. I know mocktails can also be just as expensive as mixed drinks that contain alcohol, but my husband and I are both high income earners and besides, my sister paid for the whole dinner including the mocktails.\n\nSo, AITA for drinking mocktails and potentially violating the spirit of Dry January?

Somebody might drink something considered a mocktail their whole life without knowing it's a \"mocktail\" because a mocktail isn't a kind of drink, it's a way to signal the intent something was placed on a menu for and probably the quality and freshness of it. Another person might make the exact same drink and not even think to acknowledge it as a mocktail. When I make a lemonade with fresh fruit and mint in it in the summer... am I making a mocktail because an alcoholic might think that looks like an alcoholic beverage?

A person who *doesn't* have an alcohol problem should be able to go behind the bar, throw some club soda, cranberry juice and a lime into a glass and not even have to think (\"oh, I left out the vodka\") because their world isn't defined in terms of alcohol.

You have done absolutely nothing wrong .", "Why does he get to set the terms of Dry January for you though?", "Thanks for your reply.\n\nI was probably being a little too judgemental. \n\nYou are probably right in what you said in another comment, that he is stressed and taking it out on you because you had a fun evening.\n\nNTA still, but he isn't as much of an AH as I first thoguht, have a good evening, I hope he apologises once he has had a chance to think..", "Oooh, this might be the Thing. It's not about just not drinking, it's become a whole Abstinence Thing. Like a penance.", "I think you\u2019re right\u2014his reaction sounds like it isn\u2019t really about his interpretation of Dry January rules.", "Sounds about right, tell him (nicely) to be nicer to you \ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019m assuming the Husband is like one of the anti-alcohol redditors that shows up in a lot of these threads and looking down on anything drinking adjacent. \n\nI haven\u2019t had an issue at all staying dry. I just don\u2019t really like soda and want something different than tea, water and flavored water.", "He definitely doesn't without my approval as well! However, if he had an idea that we should stick to drinking just water (or similar restrictions) he should have said so at the beginning, and we could have discussed. I had literally never thought about Dry January before, because I drink very rarely and it's never been somethingI felt I needed to cut back on.", "Thank you, I hope so too. If nothing else I would like to help him work on better ways to manage his work stress so he doesn't lash out at me over nothing. (He is normally a wonderful husband who is kind, supportive and patient. He tends to be quite critical of himself but hardly ever of others, especially me.)", "Exactly, I drink water and tea all week (not a big fan of soda in general), but on Friday night when I want something fancy? There\u2019s nothing wrong with a mocktail. They\u2019re fun to make, and can be low calorie and low sugar as well. My go to right now is alcohol-removed sparkling Prosecco or rose (like Gruvi or Freixenet) with a shot of NA gin (Like Monday or Seedlip) and lemon juice. Basically an NA French 75. Getting excited about cute drinks has helped a lot.\n\nI can see why the alcohol substitutes might be a slippery slope for someone genuinely struggling with addiction, but OP isn\u2019t so it sounds like their SO is just setting arbitrary guidelines after the fact due to jealousy or control issues, or the need to feel better than people who drink substitutes because he\u2019s sticking to \u201cpurer\u201d options.", "NTA. Is he just projecting and upset that he already failed dry January before you ?", "Ummmm actually proponents of Dry January encourage mocktails. Literally -- the Dry January health initiative in the UK is sponsored by a non alcoholic spirits company. The point is to not drink alcohol and figure out why you usually do drink and find a replacement i.e. you socially drink with friends for fun, so having a mocktail out with friends is exactly the point. For others, they drink as a way to unwind at the end of the day -- replacing that with a mocktail is also the point.\n\nIt feels like you husband is on some sort of odd diet that only pertains to liquids, not Dry January.", "Info: does husband have something stuck up his hiney? That may be what's causing his hissy fit\n\nObvious NTA", "Yeah, that is not a rule that anyone I know who has ever done dry January has ever followed. It's nonsense. It's like saying you can't have soya milk if you're doing Veganuary because it's a substitute for an animal product. NTA.", "Oh my gosh, NTA \nYour husband is being so ridiculous about this.\nEven if you had gone and had a real alcoholic drink, his reaction would be over the top. But it\u2019s definitely not common sense to not have mocktails during dry January.", ">he was angry at me for having mocktails and said it violated the spirit of Dry January to have an alcohol substitute\n\nlol\n\nNTA", "NTA He's full of poop. Drink as much fancy juice as you want. Jeez", "NTA\n\nyour husband is making things up to suit his own prejudices. Dry january is about not drinking alcohol that\u2019s it.  Give your liver a break. mocktails are totally and utterly INSIDE the spirit of dry january - so much so that lots of people go,out of thier way to host mocktail parties and learn to make and like and go on with using mocktails -  more them so life revolves less around alcohol once january is over.", "NTA. What\u2019s next? You can\u2019t have tres leches cake during Dry January because it\u2019s wet?", "NTA.\n\nI have six months sober and my partner is a few days shy of a year. We just went to a nice mocktail pairing dinner at a place in town. Zero thoughts that it was related to our sobriety in any way. If we\u2019re allowed the mocktails then certainly so are you.", "I\u2019m doing dry-ish/damp January, and let me tell you this is the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard related to this topic. Your reasoning is exactly right - dry January is a chance to give your body a break and evaluate your drinking habits if you wish! Mocktails are a fun way to still partake in fun beverages.\n\nNTA.", "Easy NTA.\n\nDoes he know what a mocktail is? Does he really even know what alcohol is?\n\n>but he is demanding an apology\n\nWhat!? \n\nTo be honest, I think your husband doesn't actually understand what has happened here, I think he has some \"gap\" in knowledge that he doesn't really know what mocktails are, maybe what \"dry January\" even means, maybe he thinks it's about saving money, or fasting or something.\n\nYou're so easily NTA here, and I think your husband is embarrassed about not getting what has actually happened here and is doubling down on it being your fault.\n\nDry January is about not drinking alcohol. **Period.**\n\nYou can have grape juice, mocktails, zero alcohol beers, whatever.", "NTA. Has there been other situations where he's become angry like this for no reason? Because this is concerning.", "NTA. Having Mocktails isn\u2019t \u201cviolating\u201d the spirit of Dry January, the only rule is no alcohol. Someone reacting in a rather hammy way about it needs to relax.", "NTA, despite it being dry January your husband is behaving like a belligerent drunk - which is way more against the spirit of dry January than mock-cocktails.", "Does he also think that vegetarians aren't allowed to eat foods made with tofu or soy that pretend to taste like meat? If you didn't drink alcohol, you're good. I can't imagine what's going through his head.\n\nNTA", "No, you are NTA for drinking fancy fruit juice. We often buy premix mocktails and zero alcohol beer when we are trying to cut down. In fact, I personally really enjoy the placebo effect stress relief of cracking a zero alcohol beer without the actual body damage of alcohol.", "I don't drink a lot due to usually being a designated driver and health issues. Had an operation while back and alcohol tolerance tanked. The popularity of Dry January has in my opinion been hugely helpful in getting pubs and bars to offer alcohol-free spirits, beers and mocktails.\n\nPlease embrace them for the sake of people like me. More people that drink, more they'll be offered. Dry January is meant to be a detox not a period of deprivation like Lent. As to the sugar, true but I find due to the sweetness and cost, I drink fewer than I used to drink beer so all works out.\n\nNTA and your husband is making it up.", "Drinking mocktails is perfectly fine.", "I sell beer and related for a living. Mocktails, NA beers, and NA wine/spirits were literally invented for this kind of thing. You can go to a store and buy canned NA margaritas and the such. Your husband is being an obtuse AH.", "NTA. What a stupid rule to make up halfway through. You didn\u2019t drink alcohol, therefore you haven\u2019t violated the spirit of dry January. Drinking fancy lemonade (since, let\u2019s be real, that\u2019s what most mocktails are) doesn\u2019t change that.", "I also laughed way too hard at the line in OPs summary \"violated the spirit\"...since alcohol=spirits...and there were no spirits here to violate!

No, I'm giving him just ice since he's a rocks guy.", "> (That eliminates most iced tea though.)   \n   \nAs someone from the Northeast, the hell it does.
