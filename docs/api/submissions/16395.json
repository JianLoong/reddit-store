The guy in front of me would not move and I could not fit around him, so she yelled at me at told me to get my ass over there. She did not like that I locked my doors then put on my seat belt, then nitpicked everything, such as waiting for her to look at me before locking my doors (they can and will doc you if you don't where I am from), and the stress from how she treated me reflected on the driving. She then proceeded to yell at me when I failed, and was bamboozled when I would not schedule my next test with her. The gentleman I had for my second test was amazing, if I had failed, I would not have been mad XD", "Congrats, OP. Just to share,  about 4 years ago,  I was where you were. I had my permit but at one point,  my ex husband was in a very upsetting accident with a texting driver.  It jarred me so bad that I couldn't drive and honestly,  I had panic attacks just being in the car. I remember my ex insisting I go to therapy because I was more distracting to him and therefore dangerous in the vehicle. I did and it helped. I found coping mechanisms. I still wasn't ready to drive just yet,  but one day,  I got promoted at my job.  It required driving 60 miles one way.  It was such a big deal that I basically had to relearn to drive and got my license.  The first month or two of driving that far was stressful. After that,  it was old news and the novelty wearing off cured me.  Great job!", "YAAAAY!!! Congratulations OP!!! I hope you are very proud of yourself for such an accomplishment! I am very proud of you even though I do not know you personally.  :) I am glad that you took additional driving lessons with an instructor who was professional and helpful. That always helps. I am very sorry that the previous driving test instructor (during your second driving exam) was so mean to you.", "Congratulations!! Good news!", "Thanks!!! I'm pretty sure you're an amazing driver then!\nActually, when people started to share their own stories on my og post, I realized that noone gets it on their first try. And that's alright, driving it's incredibly hard in the beginning! \nHaha I hope to become the go to driver for my family too \ud83e\udd2d", "Thank you so much!!! \ud83d\udcab", "I believe I was voted NTA in my original post. Why do you think I am the a-hole?", "I passed it on the first try, as did all of my friends lol", "Congrats. Your world just opened up."]}
