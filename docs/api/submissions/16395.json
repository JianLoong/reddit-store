It's great you stuck with it.", "Congratulations!! You should be really proud of yourself. Now you know you can do hard things. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "Way to go!", "Congratulations!

The guy in front of me would not move and I could not fit around him, so she yelled at me at told me to get my ass over there. She did not like that I locked my doors then put on my seat belt, then nitpicked everything, such as waiting for her to look at me before locking my doors (they can and will doc you if you don't where I am from), and the stress from how she treated me reflected on the driving. She then proceeded to yell at me when I failed, and was bamboozled when I would not schedule my next test with her. The gentleman I had for my second test was amazing, if I had failed, I would not have been mad XD", "Congrats, OP. Just to share,  about 4 years ago,  I was where you were. I had my permit but at one point,  my ex husband was in a very upsetting accident with a texting driver.  It jarred me so bad that I couldn't drive and honestly,  I had panic attacks just being in the car. I remember my ex insisting I go to therapy because I was more distracting to him and therefore dangerous in the vehicle. I did and it helped. I found coping mechanisms. I still wasn't ready to drive just yet,  but one day,  I got promoted at my job.  It required driving 60 miles one way.  It was such a big deal that I basically had to relearn to drive and got my license.  The first month or two of driving that far was stressful. After that,  it was old news and the novelty wearing off cured me.  Great job!", "YAAAAY!!! Congratulations OP!!! I hope you are very proud of yourself for such an accomplishment! I am very proud of you even though I do not know you personally.  :) I am glad that you took additional driving lessons with an instructor who was professional and helpful. That always helps. I am very sorry that the previous driving test instructor (during your second driving exam) was so mean to you.", "Congratulations!! Good news!", "Thanks!!! I'm pretty sure you're an amazing driver then!\nActually, when people started to share their own stories on my og post, I realized that noone gets it on their first try. And that's alright, driving it's incredibly hard in the beginning! \nHaha I hope to become the go to driver for my family too \ud83e\udd2d", "Thank you so much!!! \ud83d\udcab", "I believe I was voted NTA in my original post. Why do you think I am the a-hole?", "I passed it on the first try, as did all of my friends lol", "Congrats. Your world just opened up.", "YAYYYY!!! Way to go!!! That's amazing. Congratulations. \ud83d\udc9c", "Congratulations !! \nI was going to post in the other post but comments were disabled!\nThere is absolutely no shame in failing your test or waiting \nI got my permit at 17 and didn\u2019t get my license until nearly 20 \n\nFirst test I took I was 18 in my first week of college, flat out failed everything, sobbed because my mom was really pressuring me to get it done and over with \n2nd time I was 19, passed driving but failed maneuverability ( side note: my little to the day 16 year old brother passed his test this day and that was a very very bad day for me because of that lmao ) \n\nWent back a week later and only had to do maneuverability \nI was so panicked I almost got sick before the test but I passed and got it that day although that was literally the most stressful 2 minutes of my entire existence up til that point \n\nThere is no shame in being scared, there is no shame in needing more time or more practice or deciding that it isn\u2019t something for you. And I\u2019m so sorry you were made to be ashamed of it \n\nThat being said \nI\u2019m so proud of you, from one person who went through it to another, you\u2019ve done amazing and you\u2019ve pushed yourself past what you thought would be a limitation \n\nAnd that\u2019s amazing! \nLet this be a testament to your perseverance and determination in your future endeavors \nYou miss 100% of the chances you don\u2019t take \nYou took a chance, and it worked out through hard work \nGood job and enjoy this new freedom", "My nephew recently got his license on his first try, at 16 years old. It took me until I was 29 to get mine. My sister is now 29 and doesn't even have her learners. Everyone is different and all are valid.", "Congratulations!!! I passed on my first time, but only because when my parents put me in the driving portion of drivers Ed here in the US, it was clear I could not drive at all and the school insisted they get me proper driving lessons with an instructor, like you got!  Those instructors are trained, often are retired law enforcement, and are good at keeping calm and helping you learn in the way best for you!  I\u2019m glad you kept it up and that you got the proper instruction.  I would have failed 30 plus times without it!!!", "Congratulations!", "YAS you are fantastic. Seriously you should be proud that you even tried again but you got it too! This legitimately makes me smile. You're great, you're doing great and I am impressed!", "Congratulations!! My mum had 40+ years of driving experience (In multiple countries!!) and she still had to take the driving test 4 times. It really doesn't have much to do with how good you actually are at driving."]}
