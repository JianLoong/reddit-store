So today, during a Halloween get together I had the bright idea to pull Chad aside and tell him to come clean to his girlfriend May about what  he\u2019s doing, telling him that I know that he has been texting Stephanie.So eventually he decides not to tell her so I do. I pull her to the side and tell her. She\u2019s upset, he\u2019s upset, it\u2019s a mess. They decided to stay together and when I went home I felt guilty, so I call Stephanie to tell her what I\u2019ve done, before she hears it from Chad or May. She didn\u2019t outwardly state she was upset with me or anything of the sort, but I know she is upset. I just want to know, AITA or did I do the right thing. Any advice on what I could do going forward is also greatly appreciated :)", "created_utc": 1667279055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yizdq4/aita_for_telling_an_important_secret_in_an/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know some people say you shouldn't expose cheaters in others' relationships, but I disagree. I would want any of my friends to warn me if there was something I wasn't seeing. Stephanie put you in a difficult position when she told you. You were correct to let Chad have the chance to confess first.", "NTA. These guys are making drama and putting you in the middle of it. It\u2019s better everyone knows, though it would have been better for them to be adults and talk to each other instead of getting you involved.", "Typical Chad", "NTA but childish drama. In my opinion, I would have asked for a screenshot from Stephanie and shown that to May in place of verbally explaining it. All this he said she said gets chaotic too quickly. But like I said, the childish drama will lead to arguments and broken relationships all for a silly reason.", "Info:\n\n Why was Stephanie jealous?
