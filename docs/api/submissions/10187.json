A classic is not a daily driver and it does sound she has no respect for it and would readily dismiss and damage done to it.", "I had dreams like this before I started driving. And even still now that I've been driving for 10 years.", "Yeah, in the states if your car is in the shop, the car you borrow is covered by your own insurance which is primary over that of the borrowed car's owner.\n\nAlso, to weigh in on this, I can't believe she is so entitled she would think he could loan her a Rolls Royce.  How delusional is that!\n\nOP NTA.", "All cars have a clutch one is just an automatic version the other is manual.", "NTA if your girlfriend uses a silent treatment because she heard the word no sounds like you need to find a new girlfriend.", "op=NTA\n\nShe chose to leave it in longer--it is on her to get a vehicle to use during that time.  \n\nPlus in the being FOR REAL category--a 20 year old hasn't been driving that long, I wouldn't trust someone with a car older than the driver(by over twice the drivers age LOL)", "I had a similar situation with an ex-girlfriend. She refused to let me play her guitar. \n\nWhile I agree that I do not have any claim to entitlement over her guitar, I found this to be very strange and I didn't understand why she would want to date someone if she doesn't trust me with her guitar. It's not like there had been any behavior to indicate that I wasn't careful with her guitar; I am quite careful with musical instruments. It seemed to me that she simply didn't want to share, which is kind of how it sounds in your case. \n\nNow - your girlfriend is not exactly entitled to sharing all of your belongings, but I do think this is getting to a grey area in relationships. While there isn't an entitlement, it raises the question of \"why not\" if you won't allow it. \n\nI think your girlfriend has a good case for asking \"why not\". Sure, the car is sentimental, but the question is what are the odds of her totaling it? Significantly more than you? Is she a dangerous driver? If so, I think declining is totally reasonable. If not, I do not think it's reasonable.  There is some risk of the car being totaled while you're driving it, so it's clear that you are willing to accept some risk. It sounds like you are saying that you are unwilling to accept the risk if she is the beneficiary, but not if you are the beneficiary.\n\nEssentially it sounds like you are treating your girlfriend more like an acquaintance. I would not let acquaintances borrow an irreplaceable item because preserving the item is more important than preserving the relationship. But if you had an important relationship, what is more important to you?\n\nI think there are possibly NAH, but there is also possibly no strong relationship here.", "ESH", "NTA. You can\u2019t replace sentimental items and it would likely be totaled even with a small accident. She shouldn\u2019t have asked in the first place.", "Nta", "She's not old enough to rent a car", "There is such a maturity gap between 20 and 26\u2026 it\u2019s kinda sus of him imo", "Find a gf who doesn't play childish games. Nta.", "NTA... you dont have a spare vehicle.  Its unreasonable of her to expect to borrow your Rolls.", "You are NTA. For one thing, she can't drive the company vehicle as she's not on the insurance, and for the Rolls, it has a deep sentimental value to you, and just being a Rolls in running condition, is probably worth more than you think, and it's not exactly easy to come by parts if something were to happen to it. One thing to consider with that car if you don't have it already, is to look into supplemental antique car insurance from some place like Hagerty or Grundy. Your standard car insurance companies like Geico, State Farm, etc. will just total the car if it's ever in an accident (because again, parts are hard to come by and likely worth more than a damaged car from 1975) whereas these supplemental companies will work with you to have the car restored to the condition it was before the accident. I only know about this by going down some rabbit holes while researching stuff for the 70 Beetle I'm about to restore, since I've never done that before...", "NTA\n\nAnyone who says \"it's just a car\" to me when asking to borrow my car isn't the type to be trusted with it, and I drive an old Honda. The fact that she kept pushing and threw a tantrum when you continued to say no tells me that you need to find a more mature girlfriend.", "The work car? No, she can't drive the work car. \n\nAnd the Rolls Royce? You should definitely ask your insurance in writing before you gave her the keys (assuming he'd want that, which he doesn't anyway). \n\nThe Rolls Royce is not a daily driver. It's a weekend car. That's what he probably told his insurance. If you give the keys to a 20 year old who wants to use it for her daily commute, his insurance may try to wiggle out of paying him if there is an accident. \n\nBesides, even if the insurance did pay out for an accident, it's going to skyrocket his insurance premiums after that. And not wanting to pay an insane premium for insurance after an accident is a good legal reason if you ask me. Never mind that the car also has sentimental value for him.", "We'd have to know the age, mileage and type of car probably. I've had clutches last 200+ miles before I had to replace them but an older VW only lasted 120K or so. If she's driving a newer car with 50K or less then it's probably driving related.", "We typically call people in the second camp \"entitled\".", "Not sure of OP is in the US or UK but in the US you have to get special insurance for classic cars in most cases."]}
