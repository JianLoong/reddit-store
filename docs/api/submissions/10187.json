Does your gf use the silent treatment as punishment often? Because that's very unhealthy for relationships.", "NTA. \n\nThe car is valuable to *you.* It's your decision, and you told her no. \n\nShe just didn't want to bite the bullet and get a rental.", "NTA - Oh, a 20yo acting entitled and throwing a temper tantrum when she doesn't get her way. Shocking.", "NTA - she may be your girlfriend but she is not entitled to your belongings. She\u2019s dropping a couple red flags for you - both in showing a level of entitlement to your belongings, and in the immature way she\u2019s handling your \u2018no\u2019 and giving you the silent treatment. Mature adults communicate - she could say \u2018I feel like you\u2019re prioritizing a sentimental item you own over my needs and convenience and it hurts my feelings\u2019. Instead she\u2019s playing games by pouting, not understanding or respecting your attachment and sentimentality over your late dad\u2019s car, and giving you the silent treatment as an emotional manipulation tactic rather than communicating. I\u2019d re-think the relationship if she doesn\u2019t come to her senses and apologize", "NTA - she knew the answer before she asked, she didn't want to rent a car.", "NTA. Even if it was just a car, she's not entitled to use it.", "NTA. It's a car of sentimental value which would be crazy expensive to fix in the event of an accident. Also, the silent treatment is toxic AF. Your gf needs to grow the fuck up.", "Loan her a toy car since she wants to act like a child\n\nNta", "NTA. She expected she could use one of the cars without asking beforehand. She came up with an entire plan in her head that was never discussed with you. Now she\u2019s being passive aggressive and trying to manipulate you by giving the silent treatment. \n\nIt might help you to evaluate any controlling behaviors she\u2019s displayed regarding your relationship. It seems time to enforce some boundaries if you choose to stay together.", "NTA, she should have a back up plan for if things like this happen. She should also understand how much that car means to you. She asked, and you said no, that should be the end of it", "She shouldn't be giving you the silent treatment.", "NTA. It's clearly not 'just a car'. You're not obligated to loan anyone a car anyway, and her lack of respect for a sentimental item for you is concerning.", "NTA\n\nYou may mind about the idea to help here with the bill for the repair of here car.\n\nYour decision about your own car is not the point to discuss with here. Stay on your point and dont let you guilt triping.", "NTA... Company car... Nope can't loan that out. Honestly a 1975 RR is not exactly a daily driver and I wouldn't have loaned that to her either.", "NTA. The majority of clutch damage is caused by driving like an absolute banana (soruce: personal experience of doing the same, and Google). You're allowed to say no. Also, who fries their car and then gets mad when other people won't lend them theirs while their mess is fixed? I'd highly advice you don't cave. She doesn't sound like the sort that's willing to learn and do better and could end up damaging your car too.", "NTA. Even if it wasn't your dad's car or vintage, you're not obligated to loan her your car. \n\nWhat will she do if she gets into an accident with it? Expect you to fix it, probably.\nShe's having a tempter tantrum and being manipulative. \n\nIs her car under warranty? Could she have taken the bus to save money? Or an uber?\n\nDon't let her guilt trip you.", "NTA. You need your normal car and the Rolls not suitable for day to day. Sentimental value aside, they aren't the easiest to drive. She was unrealistic in her expectations.", "NTA. She isn't entitled to the use of your vehicle, regardless of any sentimental value it may or may not have. Also, the whole silent treatment thing is incredibly toxic. If this is a pattern you're gonna need to have an adult conversation about how to communicate effectively.", "NTA , like you said it was your dads what you inherited, i wouldn\u2019t let my friends wear the jewellery what I got given off my grandma what\u2019s no longer with me now. It\u2019s sentimental for a reason, I can understand it\u2019s annoying not having a car and having to rent one out but still that\u2019s life unfortunately\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA \u2014 I never let anyone borrow my car for legal reasons.", "NTA. No is a justified answer to anyone asking to borrow something. Sure it puts her in a difficult position but ultimately she can\u2019t expect other people to change their values etc to accommodate her. Silent treatment though\u2026sheesh!", "The fact she broke her clutch said everything to me to start with, not gonna let her do damage on a very special vintage vehicle.\n\nNTA", "NTA for not letting her borrow your car that has sentimental value.\n\nInfo: how long have you two been together?", "NTA - I feel like she was relying on you to help her with the car situation. But she should have told you before deciding to leave the car in the shop for a week. I guess she was disappointed when you said no.  Your reasoning behind why she can\u2019t use is valid.", "NTA Car has a sentimental value and she should respect it.", "NTA, at all. It seems to me that yes, while you have 2 cars, you do *not* have an \"extra\" car for loaning out. Company car =/= loaner. Personal, sentimental car =/= loaner. If you had a 3rd car, that was *just* a car, your own personal, non-sentimental car, I assume you'd let her borrow it. \n\n**But really, the time to ask to borrow your car would have been *before* she sent hers to the shop for a week.**", "NTA. She had no right to ask. Remind her that \"no means no\".", "NTA.\n\n\nA car rental is the way to go here", "NTA because she need to be more understanding.", "NTA. I don\u2019t like other people driving me or my husband\u2019s car and it doesn\u2019t even have sentimental value to me lol I\u2019ll be damned if I let someone drive it and they mess up and crash it. Just not a risk I\u2019m willing to take.", "NTA.. Your car, your choice. She should respect that. Especially when it's a vehicle that is special to you. She obviously knows what the vehicle means to you. But when she's in need she insults you by devaluing the vehicle saying, \"it's just a car\". Insulting/devaluing you and your property because she's in need and wants something is a red flag to take note of.", "Typically, when you ask someone \u201ccan I..?\u201d, there\u2019s a 50-50% chance they\u2019ll either say yes or no. Which is why you ask. However hard that pill is to swallow, it is what it is and she just has to get over it. NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to share your cars with someone. It would be different if you were married to her but you\u2019re not.", "NTA\n\nTechnically you have two cars, but not two driving cars.  The classic car is definitely not considered someone to just use.  You can't easily replace the parts on that, so wear and tear is a huge expense compared to a regular car.  \n\nIt really sounds like she told them to keep it the extra week banking on the fact that you would loan her a car... without asking you first.  If that's the case, it's entirely on her.", "NTA - it\u2019s emotionally intelligent of you to realize your attachment to the car and where it comes from. You understand you would blame her if the car gets damaged, even from actions not of her own. She\u2019s taking it as a personal attack instead of realizing you\u2019re protecting your relationship. Have you offered to help her in other ways? \nYou could: call around to different mechanics to see if they could get her in same day, offer to pick her up for groceries or any shopping she needs to do, look up her auto policy with her to see if it includes rental cars, see if any other mechanics offer loaner cars if you had it towed there for repair instead. I\u2019m assuming she doesn\u2019t have a positive relationship with family since they aren\u2019t helping her with a car to use. It sounds like she\u2019s more upset that she doesn\u2019t feel supported, which can be done in other ways than letting her use your dad\u2019s car.", "break up, she did all of that for a car that she damn well knows what it means for you honestly just leave her", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
