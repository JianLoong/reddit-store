It's the principle of being told by your parents that Christmas this year will be low-key with no gifts and treated as time to spend together as a family, while in the same breath being instructed to buy a gift for your golden child sister (who is already going to receive a tonne of presents from them) otherwise she'll throw a tantrum. \n\n>I told them the gift isn't the point, it's that Bree is obviously being treated differently from me, but they said it's because she still lives with them and is still a kid, and that I should grow up and stop being entitled.\n\nThose excuses will continue long after Bree stops being a kid and has flown the nest. They've raised a spoiled brat that they don't know what to do with, so they give her what she wants and demand that others do the same to give them an easy life. \n\nSo no, you're not ruining Christmas and neither are you being entitled or childish. Your parents are only upset with you and lashing out because you're pointing out where they've failed as parents, as well as leaving them on their own to deal with a 17 year old's tantrums ruining their 'low-stress' Christmas.\n\nGood luck to them.", "NTA.

And you are an adult- barely- so if they consider her a \"baby\" then you are just a toddler, given that you are only two years older than her, so you better get a present too. \n\nOr just hang out with your brother instead and swap presents and have a day free of brattiness.", "NTA\n\nShes 17.

You did right by standing your ground and insisting you wouldn't get your sister a present. However, asking for a gift isn't holding your ground as much as it is emulating your sister's behavior. That said, your sister is a child and a dependent and you are neither. You nor your parents owe each other anything in the form of presents now that you're an adult.", "It isn't fair. I was the one who got socks while another got a computer, etc. Thing is you gotta question what you really want. Is it a trinket? Is it knowing you matter to your parents? As an adult, you need to learn to communicate your needs, cause I am sure a trinket isn't it. It is too bad you didn't get help learning to communicate your needs but it is vital now.

Do you need to stoop to her level? No. You\u2019re an adult, you should probably act like one.", "NTA. Why waste time and energy to be a nonentity at Christmas. Anyone that calls a 17 yr old a baby, deserves all the tantrums and screams that they get.", "Baby sister to two older brothers speaking here. As it stands right now, you are the AH.  Because of how you\u2019re choosing to dress a legitimate issue with your parents.  I am writing, because what you choose to do next could determine your relationship with the rest of your family for the remainder of your life. \n\nYou don\u2019t tell us if your sister is still in high school. If she is still in high school, there is in my mind, a legitimate line that can be drawn, stating that she is still \u201ca baby\u201c and therefore might be treated differently because of her age. However, yes, if she graduated from high school already. Then your parents are very clearly favoring their daughter over their sons, which I find inappropriate. \n\nThe explanation given by your mother, is simply not sufficient based on the information you\u2019ve given us to say exactly how I would approach your mother next.\n\nWhether they think it\u2019s right or not, your resentment is their problem because they are creating the problem by their actions. Of \u201cspoiling her\u201d. \n\nThe mature way to handle it is to call your parents tell them that you want to have a serious discussion with them over Christmas about their treatment of your sister versus you and your brother and your perception of their obvious favoritism towards her. \n\nOur family ceased to give presents to someone in the extended family once they graduated from high school. At that point, they were considered adults and graduated to the Christmas card list.\n\nIf she is out of high school even though she still lives with them, then your family is to my mind, making an inappropriate choice favor the girl. And if I were you, I would be asking your mother a couple of questions such as, when will she ceased to be a baby when she graduates from high school when she graduates from college when she gets married when she has her first child. Let\u2019s get some clarification on that and then I\u2019d ask your mother if she can\u2019t see how her behavior towards your sister is creating resentment.  While you reacted in the heat of the moment, in a childish fashion. you don\u2019t want things to fester, and it is important that they recognize their behavior, without a more clear explanation as to why she\u2019s being treated differently,  is creating resentment in both you and your brother. Resentment that could last well beyond their lifetime.\n\n\nOne rule that our Dad laid down for our family, which might be useful here is to always, always spend the same amount of money on each child at Christmas. This meant as we got older sometimes one of us got a check or two of us got a check for different amounts. Whatever it took, the one value of the presents given to one equals the value of the check given to the other. \nNo shopping, no stress, equal money shared All around.

No matter how old you are your parents owe it to you to treat you better. You may not be \u201centitled\u201d to a present, but it seems ridiculous that your own parents wouldn\u2019t do for you what they are doing for another barely younger sibling. I understand how it feels, with direct siblings and step kids sooooo\u2026. No hold your ground, set boundaries for how you want to be treated. It\u2019s not about the presents, I see that.

I\u2019d also guess that they are low-key freaking out that she\u2019s the last \u201ckid\u201d at home and so on, as well as the only girl, but those aren\u2019t good excuses for showing such blatant favoritism.", "NTA\n\nI don't know who needs to grow up, Bree or your parents. \n\nLet them keep each other.

I do think your brother is right in the part that \u201cit won\u2019t change anything\u201d. \nI speak from experience as the middle sib w two sisters. My sisters have children and I do not and am not planning to. We had college funds of equal value and what was leftover was to be used for a down payment on a house in future. I went to good state school so had a nice chunk leftover even after an extra year or two lol. Sisters went to private uni and one even out of state. When financial collapse happened housing went to shit but I was ready to buy a few years into it using saved money. I got my house and made sure my mortgage was affordable to my portion of income. Sisters then start looking too but can\u2019t afford what they WANT which is over the top for what they can realistically afford and what do my parents do? Offer them the money for a rock bottom interest rate so they can afford the mortgage payments. I got my mortgage through a bank and was never offered to go through them for half the interest rate. They eventually did offer me the same deal after my sisters had their fancy houses. I did take them up on it bc it would have been stupid not to and it\u2019s a legally binding agreement so no funny business. My sisters went on to get my parents to pay for their children\u2019s private school tuition bc again, they wanted it and couldn\u2019t afford it w their own income. We are talking about tens of thousands here easily for 4 grandchildren over the years. May I also mention the school district they lived in is one of the top five in the damn state but still wanted private school. I used to get upset and frankly jealous that they could keep mismanaging their finances yet still have my parents give them money for all this stuff while I lived within my means. One day I had it out with my mom and started bitching about how come I don\u2019t get an annual check equal to what they spend on my sisters families for tuition all the other crap they buy them. She said \u201c1. I don\u2019t have to defend my finances to you, we can spend our money how we choose. 2. I see you and all the grandchildren as equal and not just an extension of your sisters. \u201c\nI may not agree with her reasoning if I were in her situation but I\u2019m not and she\u2019s right. It\u2019s their money and they get to spend it anyways they want and don\u2019t owe me a thing. Having a chip on my shoulder about this only hurt me so I worked really hard to let it go over time. I have learned to reframe it so I\u2019m proud of myself for making sound financial decisions, living within my means and being able to set my boundaries. Not feeling like they help me so much I owe them anything allows me the freedom to do whatever the hell I want without their approval. One of my sisters still feels like she can\u2019t make big financial decisions without consulting my parents first and she\u2019s in her late 30s. \nI guess my point in telling you this is that really in the end, you will never be able to change them but you can certainly change how you feel about it over time.

I don\u2019t think its wrong that your parents want to buy presents for Bree this year because they did the same for you at that age so I think its fair, but they shouldn't be doing it because \"you know how she is\". Bree should not be treated differently than you and your brother so, ideally, if you got presents till you were 18, so should she, but things are never really that simple. That being said, you should not be expected to bring gifts for her or anyone who you don't want to. I would say you are not TAH if you had said you would come, but not bring a gift for Bree. However, demanding a gift under any circumstances makes you an AH. I think you should go, only bring gifts for the people you actually want to give presents to, let Bree throw a tantrum or whatever she's gonna do, and peace out so your parents can deal with it.\n\nMy family has joked about how I will have big Christmases longer than my siblings because I am the youngest and my mom works very hard to keep gift giving as fair as possible.

Important additional information you just shared or that I had not seen in your original post regarding preferential treatment on her birthdays and such but more importantly, that you have sought to discuss the issue with your parents before and they shut down and get defensive.

However, I think you ought to make it clear to your parents that you have had it with their favoring your sister because she is the \u201cbaby\u201d, the only girl or whatever. If they can\u2019t show enough caring for you to buy a single present when they\u2019re choosing to spend time and money on your sister, then clearly, they don\u2019t really care whether you show up and you will find a Family of choice that will appreciate you in a way your own parents don\u2019t.

My brothers had a similar perception and yet when I informed my oldest brother that my mother had threatened to leave my dad and go with my brother if he kicked my oldest brother out, as suggested by a counselor at one point, my brother was literally shocked and felt he needed to reevaluate a number of things that he had thought about his growing up years.", "I\u2019m referencing it as a potential reason why the parents might still be giving the daughter gifts as opposed to the sons because she\u2019s a baby who hasn\u2019t graduated from high school yet that\u2019s why. Not because she\u2019s extended family which I recognize she is not.", "I actually do get that. ESH if you prefer, but OP is still being childish.", "YUP I agree 100%. You don't have to be a bad person to not be a great parent. Which I'm sorry to say, but your parents aren't really doing a great job, especially with spoiling and coddling sis. They aren't setting her up for succeeding as an adult, and good on you for not joining in enabling them. NTA", "I'm not sure I'd call them bad people. But bad parents? Yeah based on what we've learned. Seems like it. OP is NTA", "/u/AstronomerForsaken49 is a bot that stole part of a comment from /u/thehotmcpoyle here /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk6m3k/aita_for_telling_my_parents_i_wont_go_home_for/izyf7gm/", "Yeah, but a 7 year old would be super disappointed to receive nothing for Christmas. But a 2 year difference between a 17 and 19 year old and they are not getting the 19 year old diddly poop but a ton of nice stuff for the 17 year old? Not cool. If they plan on cutting the girl off when she is 18, guess it could be fair. Still does not explain why OP has to get her anything", "This times a 1000. Ask them  about the future. \nNTA", "Nah, just leave", "He is not addressing it properly.\n But I would go NC if my parents favorite my sister over me. \nHe is trying to stand up for himself after years of unfair treatment.", "Oh the whole thing is horrible. I\u2019m 46 and my parents still buy me gifts every year. I couldn\u2019t imagine them only buying them for my brother", "Sure. Going NC is among the responses I would find more mature than demanding a present.\n\nA present given under duress isn\u2019t much of a present, you see."]}
