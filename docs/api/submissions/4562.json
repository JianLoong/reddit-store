It's the principle of being told by your parents that Christmas this year will be low-key with no gifts and treated as time to spend together as a family, while in the same breath being instructed to buy a gift for your golden child sister (who is already going to receive a tonne of presents from them) otherwise she'll throw a tantrum. \n\n>I told them the gift isn't the point, it's that Bree is obviously being treated differently from me, but they said it's because she still lives with them and is still a kid, and that I should grow up and stop being entitled.\n\nThose excuses will continue long after Bree stops being a kid and has flown the nest. They've raised a spoiled brat that they don't know what to do with, so they give her what she wants and demand that others do the same to give them an easy life. \n\nSo no, you're not ruining Christmas and neither are you being entitled or childish. Your parents are only upset with you and lashing out because you're pointing out where they've failed as parents, as well as leaving them on their own to deal with a 17 year old's tantrums ruining their 'low-stress' Christmas.\n\nGood luck to them.", "NTA.

And you are an adult- barely- so if they consider her a \"baby\" then you are just a toddler, given that you are only two years older than her, so you better get a present too. \n\nOr just hang out with your brother instead and swap presents and have a day free of brattiness.", "NTA\n\nShes 17.

It\u2019s about one child being treated especially special while the others are admonished as being selfish.

She is a spoiled brat and your parents are 100% the reason for this. Sorry for your roommate being an A about it too.

You did right by standing your ground and insisting you wouldn't get your sister a present. However, asking for a gift isn't holding your ground as much as it is emulating your sister's behavior. That said, your sister is a child and a dependent and you are neither. You nor your parents owe each other anything in the form of presents now that you're an adult.", "It isn't fair. I was the one who got socks while another got a computer, etc. Thing is you gotta question what you really want. Is it a trinket? Is it knowing you matter to your parents? As an adult, you need to learn to communicate your needs, cause I am sure a trinket isn't it. It is too bad you didn't get help learning to communicate your needs but it is vital now.

Do you need to stoop to her level? No. You\u2019re an adult, you should probably act like one.", "NTA. Why waste time and energy to be a nonentity at Christmas. Anyone that calls a 17 yr old a baby, deserves all the tantrums and screams that they get.", "Baby sister to two older brothers speaking here. As it stands right now, you are the AH.  Because of how you\u2019re choosing to dress a legitimate issue with your parents.  I am writing, because what you choose to do next could determine your relationship with the rest of your family for the remainder of your life. \n\nYou don\u2019t tell us if your sister is still in high school. If she is still in high school, there is in my mind, a legitimate line that can be drawn, stating that she is still \u201ca baby\u201c and therefore might be treated differently because of her age. However, yes, if she graduated from high school already. Then your parents are very clearly favoring their daughter over their sons, which I find inappropriate. \n\nThe explanation given by your mother, is simply not sufficient based on the information you\u2019ve given us to say exactly how I would approach your mother next.\n\nWhether they think it\u2019s right or not, your resentment is their problem because they are creating the problem by their actions. Of \u201cspoiling her\u201d. \n\nThe mature way to handle it is to call your parents tell them that you want to have a serious discussion with them over Christmas about their treatment of your sister versus you and your brother and your perception of their obvious favoritism towards her. \n\nOur family ceased to give presents to someone in the extended family once they graduated from high school. At that point, they were considered adults and graduated to the Christmas card list.\n\nIf she is out of high school even though she still lives with them, then your family is to my mind, making an inappropriate choice favor the girl. And if I were you, I would be asking your mother a couple of questions such as, when will she ceased to be a baby when she graduates from high school when she graduates from college when she gets married when she has her first child. Let\u2019s get some clarification on that and then I\u2019d ask your mother if she can\u2019t see how her behavior towards your sister is creating resentment.  While you reacted in the heat of the moment, in a childish fashion. you don\u2019t want things to fester, and it is important that they recognize their behavior, without a more clear explanation as to why she\u2019s being treated differently,  is creating resentment in both you and your brother. Resentment that could last well beyond their lifetime.\n\n\nOne rule that our Dad laid down for our family, which might be useful here is to always, always spend the same amount of money on each child at Christmas. This meant as we got older sometimes one of us got a check or two of us got a check for different amounts. Whatever it took, the one value of the presents given to one equals the value of the check given to the other. \nNo shopping, no stress, equal money shared All around. Anyway, maybe something I\u2019ve said will be useful.", "NTA \n\nFor wanting to be treated equally. Trying to communicate their behavior to them doesn\u2019t work most times either. No matter how old you are your parents owe it to you to treat you better. You may not be \u201centitled\u201d to a present, but it seems ridiculous that your own parents wouldn\u2019t do for you what they are doing for another barely younger sibling. I understand how it feels, with direct siblings and step kids sooooo\u2026. No hold your ground, set boundaries for how you want to be treated. It\u2019s not about the presents, I see that.

Your sister is still living at home and it\u2019s pretty normal that she would still get Christmas presents from her parents even if they aren\u2019t doing presents for everyone.

I admit I was E S H at first, and I don\u2019t think holding Christmas for ransom is great, but I found myself wondering if the cause of the desire for the \u201clow stress\u201d Christmas is that they already spent a ton of money on Bree and are therefore cheaping out on you and your brother. I\u2019d also guess that they are low-key freaking out that she\u2019s the last \u201ckid\u201d at home and so on, as well as the only girl, but those aren\u2019t good excuses for showing such blatant favoritism.", "NTA\n\nI don't know who needs to grow up, Bree or your parents. \n\nLet them keep each other.
