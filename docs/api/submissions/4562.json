It's the principle of being told by your parents that Christmas this year will be low-key with no gifts and treated as time to spend together as a family, while in the same breath being instructed to buy a gift for your golden child sister (who is already going to receive a tonne of presents from them) otherwise she'll throw a tantrum. \n\n>I told them the gift isn't the point, it's that Bree is obviously being treated differently from me, but they said it's because she still lives with them and is still a kid, and that I should grow up and stop being entitled.\n\nThose excuses will continue long after Bree stops being a kid and has flown the nest. They've raised a spoiled brat that they don't know what to do with, so they give her what she wants and demand that others do the same to give them an easy life. \n\nSo no, you're not ruining Christmas and neither are you being entitled or childish. Your parents are only upset with you and lashing out because you're pointing out where they've failed as parents, as well as leaving them on their own to deal with a 17 year old's tantrums ruining their 'low-stress' Christmas.\n\nGood luck to them.", "NTA.

And you are an adult- barely- so if they consider her a \"baby\" then you are just a toddler, given that you are only two years older than her, so you better get a present too. \n\nOr just hang out with your brother instead and swap presents and have a day free of brattiness.", "NTA\n\nShes 17.

You did right by standing your ground and insisting you wouldn't get your sister a present. However, asking for a gift isn't holding your ground as much as it is emulating your sister's behavior. That said, your sister is a child and a dependent and you are neither. You nor your parents owe each other anything in the form of presents now that you're an adult.", "It isn't fair. I was the one who got socks while another got a computer, etc. Thing is you gotta question what you really want. Is it a trinket? Is it knowing you matter to your parents? As an adult, you need to learn to communicate your needs, cause I am sure a trinket isn't it. It is too bad you didn't get help learning to communicate your needs but it is vital now.

Do you need to stoop to her level? No. You\u2019re an adult, you should probably act like one.", "NTA. Why waste time and energy to be a nonentity at Christmas. Anyone that calls a 17 yr old a baby, deserves all the tantrums and screams that they get.", "Baby sister to two older brothers speaking here. As it stands right now, you are the AH.  Because of how you\u2019re choosing to dress a legitimate issue with your parents.  I am writing, because what you choose to do next could determine your relationship with the rest of your family for the remainder of your life. \n\nYou don\u2019t tell us if your sister is still in high school. If she is still in high school, there is in my mind, a legitimate line that can be drawn, stating that she is still \u201ca baby\u201c and therefore might be treated differently because of her age. However, yes, if she graduated from high school already. Then your parents are very clearly favoring their daughter over their sons, which I find inappropriate. \n\nThe explanation given by your mother, is simply not sufficient based on the information you\u2019ve given us to say exactly how I would approach your mother next.\n\nWhether they think it\u2019s right or not, your resentment is their problem because they are creating the problem by their actions. Of \u201cspoiling her\u201d. \n\nThe mature way to handle it is to call your parents tell them that you want to have a serious discussion with them over Christmas about their treatment of your sister versus you and your brother and your perception of their obvious favoritism towards her. \n\nOur family ceased to give presents to someone in the extended family once they graduated from high school. At that point, they were considered adults and graduated to the Christmas card list.\n\nIf she is out of high school even though she still lives with them, then your family is to my mind, making an inappropriate choice favor the girl. And if I were you, I would be asking your mother a couple of questions such as, when will she ceased to be a baby when she graduates from high school when she graduates from college when she gets married when she has her first child. Let\u2019s get some clarification on that and then I\u2019d ask your mother if she can\u2019t see how her behavior towards your sister is creating resentment.  While you reacted in the heat of the moment, in a childish fashion. you don\u2019t want things to fester, and it is important that they recognize their behavior, without a more clear explanation as to why she\u2019s being treated differently,  is creating resentment in both you and your brother. Resentment that could last well beyond their lifetime.\n\n\nOne rule that our Dad laid down for our family, which might be useful here is to always, always spend the same amount of money on each child at Christmas. This meant as we got older sometimes one of us got a check or two of us got a check for different amounts. Whatever it took, the one value of the presents given to one equals the value of the check given to the other. \nNo shopping, no stress, equal money shared All around.

No matter how old you are your parents owe it to you to treat you better. You may not be \u201centitled\u201d to a present, but it seems ridiculous that your own parents wouldn\u2019t do for you what they are doing for another barely younger sibling. I understand how it feels, with direct siblings and step kids sooooo\u2026. No hold your ground, set boundaries for how you want to be treated. It\u2019s not about the presents, I see that.

I\u2019d also guess that they are low-key freaking out that she\u2019s the last \u201ckid\u201d at home and so on, as well as the only girl, but those aren\u2019t good excuses for showing such blatant favoritism.", "NTA\n\nI don't know who needs to grow up, Bree or your parents. \n\nLet them keep each other.

I have temper, and tend to straight-out say what everyone is thinking, but keep to themselves. \n\nI had a sister-in-law who was probably a covert narcissist, and she couldn't stand me. Fortunately we never loved together, but when she and my brother were present, she kept up a running monologue of all of my faults, real and imagined, while the rest of my family feigned deafness. If I complained, or worse, reacted, I was the one who got shat on by my parents. Effectively, they chose her over me because I refused to allow my SIL to abuse me. \n\nIn the end, I refused to attend any event where she and my brother were going to be. According to them, I was over-reacting, imagining things, and being unreasonable.", "There might be justification to still give her something, since it would also be unfair for her to have fewer years of presents than her older siblings. But that would only apply if OP got comparable gifts two years ago, which it sounds was very much not the case. And the older siblings shouldn\u2019t be pressured to give her gifts as well.\n\nI agree with the commenter who suggested that the no-gift \u201csimplification\u201d is so they can afford to cater to their daughter\u2019s greed.\n\nAnd the \u201cbut she\u2019s the baby\u201d stuff is made of cringe. She\u2019s 17.", "If I had a tantrum at 17, there\u2019s be no Christmas at all!", "Yeah, and also consider if you keep entangling yourself in their situation, if they ever run out of money it will be very easy for them to try and shove her off on you. You need to distance if you don't want her to become your problem in the future", "I would arrive with only a present for the brother.", "That won't be for a veeerry long time. If ever. If she's physically attractive enough she'll eventually con men into giving her what she wants. \n\nSource: Reddit", "Her first divorce!", "Good gawd, that was brutal to read", "Part of me wants OP to be petty and show up on Christmas with gifts for everyone except Bree.  Hell, he should even bring a wrapped gift for himself.", "What what what? She got gifts on your birthday? There\u2019s some trauma on your parents side that you don\u2019t know but that doesn\u2019t excuse this shit. They are raising an entitled person who will harm others \u2026 call them out on it because they are not doing any favours to your sister, her siblings or society.", ">I was over-reacting,imagining things, and being unreasonable.\n\nOh, and let me guess, she was just joking? And you were over-sensitive and had no sense of humour.\n\nNarcissist tend to spot the people they cannot manipulate immediately and will fight until they either beat them or get rid of them.\n\nIt's like they see you, you see them, and nobody else sees it.\n\nI had the same situation, only the narcissist is my mother and the family fell for her and me defending myself was taken as me being nasty to her. But they were fine with her attacks on me, my husband and even our young children.", "This was my first thought! I think they wanted \u201csteer free Christmas\u201d because they didn\u2019t want to spend more money than they already had on the golden child. There\u2019s no other reason I can think of. I\u2019m baffled that they even thought this was ok!", "YTA if you don\u2019t show up.

NTA", "How weird is it for a 17 year old to want to be the only one opening gifts. If everyone else just supposed sit and cheer? That\u2019s ridiculous. OPs parents are setting her up for a rough ride as she meets people who won\u2019t tolerate her bullshit.", "Yep. People don't stop growing up just because they have a few decades behind them and have raised 3 kids. These parents still have some growing up to do.", "Same here\u2026also in similar situation to OP where if my younger sister doesn\u2019t get her way or what she wants, she\u2019ll cut my parents off till she \u201cgets over it\u201d. Let me say, we are ADULTS and she\u2019s pulling this crap. Pisses me the F off. I\u2019m LC with her and it\u2019s just a matter of time with my parents cause even tho I\u2019m over 40, this is BS and I\u2019m sick of it and it WONT EVERY CHANGE! \n\nNTA OP, also start thinking of how you want your family dynamics to be in the future cause like I said, it wont change and it can get hell of a lot worse", "Someone actively deciding to act in such a way that it hurts their own child's feelings when there is no need to do that and an easy alternative IS a bad person.", "I don't think I would be a good parent so I've chosen not to have children", ">I don't want that one thing to keep making me feel bad.\n\nIt's not a thing that is making you feel bad. Your parents ACTIONS are making you feel bad. They are actively choosing to act in a way that makes you feel bad. You are so used to it that you don't see the forest for the trees. \n\nIn my book, a parent actively deciding to act in a way that makes their child feel bad when there is another easy option IS a bad person.", ">I didn\u2019t say they were bad people\n\nI'll say it then. They're bad people.", "And guess who they\u2019re going to come whine to when they're old and want someone to take them in and take care of them. I\u2019ll give you a hint. It sure as hell won\u2019t be your sisters.", "I think the \"no gifts, except for the kids\" would make sense if the siblings were all kids, or all considered adults. Or even if Bree was a decade younger than the other siblings. But OP is only two years older than Bree. For him to be \"an adult = no gifts\" and her to be \"a child = gifts\" is not fair.", ">For your own mental health and well being it\u2019s time to consider low to no contact with them. Don\u2019t keep setting yourself up to get hurt because your parents obviously favor your sister.\n\nYeah, this whole \"I wont go unless I get a present\" is the wrong approach.\n\nJust dont go. If they ask why, just be honest.", "I mean even a lot of 7 year olds wouldn't behave like that! For my nephew's 7th birthday he really wanted this quite expensive thing so my mum and I said we'd buy it together and my sister explained to him that meant he would only get 1 present from grandma and his aunt - and asked him to choose if that was what he really wanted. \n\nTotally agree - do they take no responsibility for \"how she gets\"??", "Holy cow gifts for her on your bday!!! Yikes that\u2019s blatant favoritism and yeah she was once younger but she couldn\u2019t even make you a card?", "Stop helping your parents spoil your sister\u2026", "Moves out? What makes you think that will happen?", "Yeah like the source is reliable \ud83d\ude12 lol. /s\n\nBut yeah. I read a heart wrenching post from a \"stepdad\" about how her gf of 10-15 years was a sahm for all their relationship (the daughter was like 20-25 engaged). When she was to be married which the stepdad had offered to pay for, his friends were not invited, none of his song suggestions were entertained, the buffet even had 2 items he was alergic too. It took that long for him to realise they were just using him, and get out of that toxic relationship.", "In their desperation apparently they didn't care!\n\nThey went for the two for one, save money by not buying gifts for the other kids and save money by making the other kids buy gifts. As evidenced by them telling OP exactly what to buy.", "She wasn't planned, iirc, and my parents always wanted a girl, so I think they think she's God's special gift to them or something.", "He's probably right that your parents won't open their eyes till Bri is an entitled adult who still demands things all the time. But setting a boundary is good for you, so go ahead with it. The parents can celebrate with the golden kid, while you can have a fun holiday that is centered on you, not someone else.", "Come on, you are REALLY extreme.\n\nGet therapy?\n\nCut his family off?\n\nThese ideas are crazy.", "The book \u201cAdult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents\u201d is really helpful for people in that weird space of having loving parents who meant well who also really screwed up in some important aspects of parenting that have had long-term consequences.", "Oh yeah, I remember that story. IIRC, there was another update where he found out his ex and \"daughter\" had been playing Happy Families with the bio dad all along, and that was why the step daughter started getting angry and distant. Because she blamed OP for the reason why her parents couldn't be openly in a relationship. But that they were just playing OP to get as much money and benefits out of him for as long as possible. So, in the end, they still got quite a bit of money out of him and then just moved on together like they were a family the whole time."]}
