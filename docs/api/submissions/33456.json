Ultimately, his parents can decide to do whatever they want with the farm. Whether SIL thinks is fair or not is moot.

I'll say NTA since you've been polite enough to not say anything for probably years, but don't burden yourself with her and possibly add'l people's anger. You will likely see her significantly less, and that will be reward enough.", "YWNTBA. But - what is the purpose? Aside from hurting SIL, what will you accomplish from saying that?

She is now reaping what she sowed. And regardless of how we're all raised, we are responsible for our behavior as adults. She's had time to become a better person, or even just keep her yap shut, and she chooses not to.", "YWNBTA - as long as she makes negative remarks to you about things. If she attacks you,  certainly respond as matter of factly as you can, otherwise,  keep well out of it.", "Absolutely NTA. That\u2019s a moral judgment. From a practical perspective, what do you have to lose? If it isn\u2019t stated in the will, get your husband to ask for a letter stating why the farm is going to him and not his sister.", "YWNTBTA but will it help, or just add petrol to the fire?", "YTA. or you would be. not your circus.  not your monkeys. stay the hell outta it.", "Like you, I also enjoy mentally rehearsing arguments with people, in which I destroy them with my obvious and blatant being-right-ness.  It's a pleasant way to occupy an idle hour analyzing all my furious unspent rage.\n\nIt's understandable, you're not an asshole, but as of right now this is an NAH.  You're predicting she's going to react badly, you hate her, she's a bad person, yadda yadda.  Great.  As of right now she hasn't actually done anything *about this specific issue* either.  So feel free to psychologically crush her in your head, it does nobody any harm.  It doesn't do any good, but if that were our standard for what goes on in the privacy of our own thoughts we'd have a lot fewer thoughts.", "NTA.", "Thank you for those visuals! It gave me a laugh to know I explained it well enough for someone to see it as I have all these years. I am not planning on seeking her out to drop a bomb on her and point out how she was manipulated by those she trusted most, but I'm not sure I can hold my tongue if she gets in my face or tries having one of her famous pity parties about how mistreated she's is. It's gotten well past old, and honestly so have I, and my tolerance for drama has worn thin and drama is what she lives for. I'm not particularly concerned about what the family thinks of me. Other's opinions of me are none of my business at this stage in life, and if they're bashing me, someone else is getting a break.", "\"around your husband and his sister losing their *parents*\"\n\nThe farm has been put in a trust, so this is happening now, not after they're gone.

I don't think being blood should be the only qualifier for speaking up in a family tho.", "I have no doubts she knows I don't like her. I'm polite, but avoid her when possible. (Tho to be honest, I'm not the most social person in general.) I don't think most people would happily interact with someone who constantly makes any jab they can at them, and she's been that way with me from day one. And I would prefer to stay out of it, but I'm not sure I'm going to have that option, which is why I'm asking the question.", "Thank you! I have two sides warring with each other on this. There's the side that thinks it's too harsh and will accomplish little to nothing, then there's the side that thinks it's long overdue for someone to spell it out to her. I feel bad that no one who actually cares about her has or will point out to her that she's not blameless. If she'd have tried even a little bit over the years, I know things could've been different. This isn't what her parents wanted, but she's made them out to be the villains in her story since long before I came along. They've been her punching bag as long as I've known her. Even when she moved out and then moved back in with a husband and baby and expected her parents to support them all (and they did support them), they were dirt who did had never done anything for her. Her parents (and my husband and I) spent years showing up when they asked for help only to be told they were busy when the roles were reversed. We've all had times when people came to us telling us the vitriol she spreads about us to others. None of us are saints, but it's like her goal in life is to be an adult Regina George. It will probably cause a bigger headache than it's worth, but you are correct and I have not said anything for decades and it crawls under my skin, especially with this looming over my head like bomb waiting to go off. I sincerely hope it's just my anxiety and it'll never come to pass.", "I'm not hoping for this and would rather avoid it, but I just don't see her not dropping this in my lap before it's done. I've always been one of her favorite targets, I'm assuming because my hands are somewhat tied as an in-law in a family that, for the most part, tends to look down on in-laws and sees them as not real family (save the one they marry, of course). I could be wrong and hope I am, but I don't see her not blowing up at me or trying to give me one of her pity parties about how horrible she's being treated at the very least. But, if I'm honest, there is a part of me that would like to put her in her place after dealing with decades of her shit and being expected to just endure it 'because you know how she is'. It's been exhausting.", "Thank you! I'm hoping to not be drug into the middle of it, but I'm finding it hard to believe I'll be able to stay clear of this one.", "I am hoping to stay out of it, but she's often seen me as an easy target because I usually bite my tongue, so I have a feeling she'll bring the issue to me before it's done. Thank you for seeing where I was coming from, it's rather difficult to fit it all in the character limit and not sound like an AH.", "The farm is in a trust and the will leaves everything to my husband except a set cash amount for his sister. Even after years of hearing the farm would be left to my husband (the farm is seen as being kind of separate from everything else), I was kind of surprised at just how thoroughly she'd burned her bridges with her parents.", "With her, most anything I say or do adds fuel to the fire. She sees in-laws as less than, never real family and only out to get the farm from it's rightful heirs. It's a view she got from her grandmother, who was an in-law, and managed to manipulate things to get control (but not ownership) of the farm. I've always thought there was some projection going on there. LOL!\n\nEdit: misspelling", "Before you say something you should think \"Is it kind? NO Is it important? NO Is it helpful? NO. Then there's no point in saying anything at all. I am also a blunt person who likes to get to the point, that doesn't mean I am unkind. You win nothing by speaking to her like that and only harm.", "Why, of all the people in her entire life and family, would it be important or useful for you to do this or try to do it? Why are you planning in advance as if it's going to change anything or be anything but a big fight? You want her to see she's made bad choices and is getting what she deserved. You're the last person who's going to convince her, there's nothing about your entire relationship that suggests you have her best interests at heart or are someone she should listen to or confide in. It's purely inserting yourself into drama for the sake of it. It's not productive, it's not your problem, you're not a person who can change a single thing here, and it's not a good or mature look.", "She is the AH. But\u2026\n\nIt would be way better to just stay out of it. I\u2019m plenty \u201cconfrontational.\u201d But I also stay out of sibling stuff when I\u2019m not the sibling.

I also don\u2019t stir the pot because I\u2019m super close with her absolutely awesome children (my cousins are dope and we do dope shit). \n\nWould I be complete right pointing out when she\u2019s off the rails? Yup.

Don't burden yourself with it, because a person like her isn't looking for reasons why, she just wants to complain. She's a professional victim. But feel free to go off about her online all you want. I'm sure you have more than a few entertaining (boiling) stories about her that you can share in r/stories or one of the many narcissist boards. While it doesn't accomplish anything irl, it sure is cathartic, and sometimes that's all you need.", ">I'm not hoping for this\n\nYeah you clearly are its kinda sad that your life is so boring that your are looking to start drama about something that has nothing to do with you. \n\nIn laws like you cause more issues than anything else", "I get where you are coming from. What does your husband support you doing if his sister gets in your face? That should be your limiting factor. In the meantime, look up the grey rock method for dealing with her.

I wouldn't think you necessarily an AH, but it's not going to change her or the situation.", "In general, I agree with that and tend to operate that way. I do think it's important for her to realize she isn't a blameless victim, tho. I had that mindset once upon a time and some real talk from an unlikely (and at the time, unwanted) source helped snap me out of it. Whether she would be able to hear that from me is a whole other thing, tho. But the people who she might actually listen to just pacify her to shut her up.", "I am not planning to seek her out for anything. I am expecting her to bring the issue to me because she knows she'll get no-where but shutdown with her dad or brother and I expect to be the one she sees as most easy to lash out against without consequences, just as it's always been.

I can't fit decades in there and very little of my interactions with her have been pleasant. I tried to befriend her in the beginning, but she made it clear she thought I was beneath her as an in-law. Can you suggest a constructive way to have the conversation, even if it's my husband doing the talking? I'm not wanting to go for the jugular, but I also don't think politely dancing all the way around it is going to do anything. No one in this family actually communicates face to face, they rely on the grapevine to do their dirty work unless they just blow up. I hate it, but my hands have been tied from the start.", "Yes and no. My husband and my kids do inherit, I just get more unpaid labor. My name will never be on the deed and I don't really want or need it there. I do get caught in the middle of it all tho and have to deal with all the drama.", "The only way I'd say anything to her is if she tries to dump her drama in my lap, and it would take her actively getting in my face or going after my family. Her and her husband have put a bit of a target on my son's back in recent years, probably because they know he'll inherit the farm after my husband. (To clarify why my son will inherit the farm, my daughter wants him to have it as she knows my son will be the one putting in the work and she doesn't feel entitled to half of it while he works his ass off for it and just helps here and there. The farm is seen as a separate thing from any other inheritance, kind of a whoever works it gets it thing.)", ">When it comes to generational property issues. Yes blood is the only qualifier.

Part of me does want to unload, but that would consist of way more than telling her she holds some responsibility in the condition of her relationships with her family. There's no lack of ammunition with her, from all the way back to baby-trapping her husband to the current of turning on her own child and bad mouthing him to everyone like she does her parents because she feels his lifestyle reflects badly on her. If I was just wanting to unload, I could completely burn her life to the ground, start to finish, and never touch this subject, but that isn't my goal and never will be. Maybe I am lying to myself, which is why I posted. I've been in the middle of this dramafest for decades and know I have biases.

But your family would still inherits a large and presumably valuable chunk of land.", "I have no real ability to decide to stop farming it. That would be my husband's choice and one I don't see happening, so it's either support it or ruin my marriage. I see it as his hobby, one he's loved longer than he's known me, so while I have my issues with it at times, I will continue to do what I can to help with it. I do enjoy it most cases, save chasing cattle that have broken out, doing hay when it's 100\\*, and things like that, but it's not my thing, it's his and now my son's.\n\nAnd yes, my family (excluding myself) would still inherit a large and somewhat valuable chunk of land, but being as selling it is out of the question (my husband would sell his soul first), I find that point rather moot. I do understand others seeing that very differently tho.", "Again your son could decide to not farm and jsut sell leaving your daughter without money and your fine with that?
