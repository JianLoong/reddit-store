Let's say she does not leave you over this (she might, it is a valid reason and I know of at least one relationship which broke precisely for that reason). Will you lead a double-life till your parents are dead? All these things, you not believing anymore, having a girlfriend from another country etc. will most def. come out (especially if you have a youtube-channel, for crying out loud!). So, at one point the hammer will come down anyway. Maybe it is better if you decide when and how the hammer comes down instead of pure coincidence. \nYour parents should get in their head that you moving to another country means you will ne affected by different customs. And that it is likely that you will find a partner that is from that culture / ethnicity. \n\nI am not gonna lie, while i would give a partner from a very different culture than mine some slack, at some point i would just seperate. Because if my partner is so ashamed to be with me so he cannot tell his/her relatives, this has no future and he/she lacks respect for me. I would also suspect i am justhere for \"fun time\" he/she wants to have.\n\nEdit: rating is YTA, but without malice. You are young, this is tough and you are doing some mental splits. But this whole thing is not sustainable and basically leads to you disrespecting you GF till she leaves you. I also suspect you do not think things through tbh, because leading a double-life and being present on an international plattform as entertainer does not work. Your family might get it that this is you through your content and voice, amd as soon as your face is public because you have 100 000 subs (which is a lot!)

You just have cultural differences that you need to talk about and either overcome or realize you don't fit and break up.\nWhat would be relevant to me is if you still live in Algeria and if your social media audience is mainly from that cultural group. Because if it is you would commit social- and career suicide if you posted that pic. If you live in the western world and your channel does have a western audience then you should maybe consider if it's time to adjust.\n\nYou say you yourself don't have the values that you try to live by as not to offend your family.

If you love your gf and see a future then you need to stand up for the relationship and tell the truth. Following this, despite the reaction of family, you should feel proud and happy to share pictures of the two of you.

It not-what happens when your parents encourage you to find a wife or ask why you're rejecting suitable ones they suggest? Either date someone your family likes or understand that you're going to have to go through some discomfort to be a good partner.

It\u2019s just part of the deal. When he\u2019s with my family he can let his atheist hair down, but around his, we respect their boundaries (within reason).

Try to reinforce to her that that\u2019s not the case, but the cultural pressures you\u2019re under aren\u2019t something she could begin to understand. I made friends with Muslims my age and talking to them about it really helped me see that it wasn\u2019t just my husband, it really is this way with most people from Muslim families.
