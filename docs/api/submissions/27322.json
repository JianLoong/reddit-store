Let's say she does not leave you over this (she might, it is a valid reason and I know of at least one relationship which broke precisely for that reason). Will you lead a double-life till your parents are dead? All these things, you not believing anymore, having a girlfriend from another country etc. will most def. come out (especially if you have a youtube-channel, for crying out loud!). So, at one point the hammer will come down anyway. Maybe it is better if you decide when and how the hammer comes down instead of pure coincidence. \nYour parents should get in their head that you moving to another country means you will ne affected by different customs. And that it is likely that you will find a partner that is from that culture / ethnicity. \n\nI am not gonna lie, while i would give a partner from a very different culture than mine some slack, at some point i would just seperate. Because if my partner is so ashamed to be with me so he cannot tell his/her relatives, this has no future and he/she lacks respect for me. I would also suspect i am justhere for \"fun time\" he/she wants to have.\n\nEdit: rating is YTA, but without malice. You are young, this is tough and you are doing some mental splits. But this whole thing is not sustainable and basically leads to you disrespecting you GF till she leaves you. I also suspect you do not think things through tbh, because leading a double-life and being present on an international plattform as entertainer does not work. Your family might get it that this is you through your content and voice, amd as soon as your face is public because you have 100 000 subs (which is a lot!)

You just have cultural differences that you need to talk about and either overcome or realize you don't fit and break up.\nWhat would be relevant to me is if you still live in Algeria and if your social media audience is mainly from that cultural group. Because if it is you would commit social- and career suicide if you posted that pic. If you live in the western world and your channel does have a western audience then you should maybe consider if it's time to adjust.\n\nYou say you yourself don't have the values that you try to live by as not to offend your family.

If you love your gf and see a future then you need to stand up for the relationship and tell the truth. Following this, despite the reaction of family, you should feel proud and happy to share pictures of the two of you.

It not-what happens when your parents encourage you to find a wife or ask why you're rejecting suitable ones they suggest?

He will have to choose one day, whether it's now or with a different GF, it's not fair to the girl to have a relationship for years and keep it a secret from his family. If he was not safe, I could understand him being reluctant, but he is in another country so he *probably* won't have problems. I didn't have this severe of an issue, but one of my family members is so conservative that she still doesn't allow me and my boyfriend of 5 years (we live together and we're in our late 20s) to sleep in the same bed when we visit.

The 3 months would be too soon to blow up her family for a guy she recently met.  They would call him toxic and controlling and not understanding her cultural problem. People would tell her to leave him. \n\nI don't know if you're in a relationship or know of a Middle Eastern culture.

In  6 months to a year, if you\u2019re still together, I think you will have to look at the bigger picture.

Especially because when you\u2019re with her those cultural/family pressures aren\u2019t as much a factor. What if your family can\u2019t accept her? What if she feels uncomfortable following certain Muslim traditions. These are all things you will have to face at some point.

You are waving red flags that will make this relationship likely to fail. \nAlso, you are thinking about marriage after 3 months? This is another red flag.\n\nSomeone said you want to enjoy western freedoms without the sacrifices that come with it. I agree. Of course it would be better to have not crusty-overbearing-bigotted parents. But you do. And all these freedoms you enjoy now outside of algeria were actually fought for, and still need to be defended. They are not as \"natural\" as they seem to be on the surface. That is something to keep in mind, too. Westerners also had to fight for getting out under the boot of their parents, husbands and nosy relatives, that is not something that was a part of western culture since forever. And there were sacrifices made to gain these freedoms. \n\nAlso, even if you could theoretical maybe sell the marriage, what about all the other things? Alcohol, atheism etc.? Will you just lie forever? Is it worth to keep contact and be on friendly terms with people who are that bigotted? As long as you were alone, these things were just stuff you could procrastinate and work on in your own time. But now another human being is involved, and your decisions to deflect amd avoid conflict affect her. So it is not just you and your convenienve anymore that this is about. The clock is ticking. \nIf you do not want to confront your parents, you should not be in a relationship with someone outside of algeria. You are in a cross-cultural relationship and have to compromise on many things to make it work.

No. Is there a reason to introduce a girlfriend of three months to your parents? No. But keeping her a secret for literal years?!

I doubt there's many people that would want to be hidden like some dirty secret for years until you decide to tell your parents because you want to get married.
