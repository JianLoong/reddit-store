It\u2019s about a young boy using his sister\u2019s makeup without permission and being told not to use it. Yes, that is stealing.\n\nAnother thing to note is that sharing makeup is NOT a good idea. This is because of germs and/or facial conditions being spread out from person to person. It\u2019s a hygiene issue! \n\nOP tell your son he can have his own makeup and he can buy it with his own money just like his sister.", "I think you may have been a bit harsh but I would still say NTA for a couple of reasons.  \n\nYour son is 12 which is old enough to know what stealing is, regardless of what something cost.  He stole, he got caught, he got punished - good life lesson.  \n\nAnd he tried to guilt trip you - you are not denying him anything except access to his sister's makeup which he shouldn't have without her consent.  His manipulation didn't work so maybe he will learn not to use it which could be another good life lesson.", "NTA. It's good to teach that taking from others is not appropriate behavior. Grounding him was a good choice. But I do think you should ask him if he would like some makeup himself after he is no longer grounded and maybe have him earn the money with chores or odd jobs around the house so he can earn his money and buy it. That way, he can see the value of buying his own things and no longer take his sister's stuff.", "NTA. Sharing makeup is unhygienic.  Buy him some drugstore stuff for the holidays.", "This is not where I thought this was going, but maybe offer him chores to earn his own money to buy it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for yelling at him for stealing. I think you\u2019re awesome for allowing him to express himself", "NTA. I\u2019m assuming this wasn\u2019t the first time you, your daughter, or your wife have told him to leave her makeup alone. And I\u2019m assuming that if there were behavioral conditions that has his mental age younger than 12, you would have stated that. 12 is definitely old enough to know that to mess with other people\u2019s property without their permission. \nAfter his punishment is over, discuss with him steps y\u2019all can take for him to get his own makeup. If you don\u2019t buy it for your daughter, you shouldn\u2019t buy it for him either.", "NTA. You stopped your son from stealing and shut down his manipulative defense. Sounds ok. Now, how will your son get his own makeup? Can you provide him with reasonably priced options?", "NTA, he\u2019s 12, but playing that kind of card to get away with theft is low, and he needs to learn that its wrong to do that. If he wants to use makeup, he needs to ask or buy his own. Your daughter is right to be upset, it\u2019s expensive and I can\u2019t imagine she makes a ton of money at 14. I don\u2019t think grounding and lock for sister is overkill, but to show you do support him, maybe some supplies of his own would be a nice Christmas gift.", "NTA. Your son is plenty old enough to know better, in fact, he *clearly*  understands that he needed to sneak around to access her makeup after she told him \"No.\"\n\nI'm sure you have plenty of chores needing to be done in your home that are age appropriate for him to do to earn an allowance from you in order to purchase his own makeup.\n\nPlus, the holidays are coming up, he should put some of the makeups he likes/wants on his gift list.", "honestly, NTA. but, as a compromise since all of you are open to him experimenting with makeup, i'd offer to buy him his own as a starting kit. Him trying to guilt trip you is wrong, but he's also only 12. I think both of you (you and wife) sitting down with him and explaining that you'll always support him BUT that 'borrowing' without consent is wrong , not a full 'you're grounded for a whole week'    \n\n\nI think this would be a good learning opportunity for son. Explain how money works, explain how sister is getting upset (not because he's using makeup, but because he's using HER hard earned makeup from working). Is an allowance an option for son if he does chores? that would be a great way to teach him monetary value & he'd be able to buy his own?", "NTA, but can you buy him some cheap pallets until he can buy his own? This is going to keep being a problem otherwise.", "NTA.  12 is old enough to know you don\u2019t take other people\u2019s stuff without asking them first. It doesn\u2019t matter what it costs or even what it is. This stuff belongs to his sister, not him. He should apologize to her for taking her things. However, after the punishment, it\u2019s time to solve the problem & help your son get make up of his own.", "NTA. At 12, if he had decided to \"borrow\" from a store, he'd end up dealing with law enforcement. He's not a toddler, he knows full well that what he was doing was stealing. Then, when caught red-handed, he doubled down and played the victim. \n\nIf mom wants makeup to be shared, she can share hers. \n\nOthers have commented that you are unfair, because he can't get a job to earn money to buy his own expensive stuff. I'm sure you can think of several extra chores he can do around the house, for neighbors, etc to earn some money. The 9-13 year old boys around my neighborhood do baking, leaf raking, pet sitting, car washing, etc.", "You're not asking him not to wear make up you're telling him not to steal his sister's make up without her permission.  One would make you the AH the other would not.  A 12 year old is old enough to see the difference.  I hope you made it clear he is free to earn his own money to buy his own make up.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA but maybe offer to get him his own, or give him the opportunity to earn money to buy his own. For everyone saying he's \"just a child\" and shouldn't be yelled at, get over yourself. A 12 year old knows what stealing is, he clearly waited until his sister wasn't home to take it. And then when confronted about it, tried to argue that he was being suppressed? That's manipulation, it sounds like he has never been anything but encouraged with his makeup curiosity. The older sister was kind enough to share her stuff, now she's expected to just hand it over whenever he wants? Either y'all don't have preteens or never had siblings.", "NTA\n\nYou and mom need to talk to him. Self expression happens on your own dime. All he's expressing is thievery.", "Buy them both some more make up, him so he has his own, her to help replace what he's taken and to treat them equally.", "Okay but why can\u2019t I with my job at 25 still can\u2019t think about buying dior lip oil and the 14 year old with her baby sitting money is buying it \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. \n\nLet him use your wife\u2019s makeup then.", "INFO: have you bought him any of his own stuff?", "NTA. Your son is old enough to know that stealing is wrong and deserves to be grounded for it. At the same time, make sure he understands that the stealing is the issue and not the make up.

That makeup belongs to your daughter.", "NTA he's old enough to recognize you have a problem with people stealing, not boys in makeup.

You win parenting. \ud83c\udfc5", "NTA. He's 12. He didn't ask his sister permission to use her makeup nor did he ask his parents to buy him a set. He took it without telling her. It's perfectly ok to punish him for that although grounding for a week might be harsh. Try to talk to him about why he was wrong and what he should have done.

Problem solved. \n\nIt definitely is wrong for him to steal hers, but he might be too embarrassed to ask you for his own.

What is this going to teach him - resentment, frustration and boredom. Likely to create more problems.

Grounding him seems appropriate, especially considering the guilt tripping, but I don\u2019t think yelling was.", "A week so too harsh. A consequence is fine but a week is over the top. He wasn't stealing just borrowing. Doesn't sound like he was taking it to hide it, but use it. A lock makes sense. And telling him he can't use his sister's stuff without permission..but 1 full week of being grounded for using someone else's stuff is excessive. Would he be grounded for 1 week for eating a few of someone's Oreos? Probably not. \n\n\nBut, you have a bigger problem. You son feels like he isn't being allowed to express himself. That could turn out badly. Ask him if he wants his own makeup for the holidays. This way you are communicating respect for his desires while also setting a boundary that he can't just take his sister's stuff.", "INFO. Was he warned not to take her stuff without permission?  Because if he wasn't, and you jumped straight to grounding, I can see why he's pissed.  They were already sharing the makeup since you say she would put it on him.  If he wasn't told it was hers alone and he couldn't use it without explicit permission, he probably didn't think it was a big deal for him to use the stuff (like using the same shampoo bottle, or hand soap) and it would seem like the problem was him putting it on, not taking it without permission.", "YTA for yelling (not that I'm not guilty of that myself!  We're all AHs sometimes...)\n\nI agree that he needs some kind of consequence for stealing, but it also sounds like the kid needs some makeup of his own.  Why don't you get him like a starter set or a gift card or something?  \n\nBefore anyone jumps on me, I'm not suggesting it as a reward for stealing.  That is a separate issue for which consequences are called for.", "I'm 50/50 on this one you being YTA. Yes, stealing is wrong and at 12 he knows it. But at that age when kids are trying to find out who they are lines get blurry in their eyes.  \nWhat you should have done after the first time is take your son make-up shopping.", "[deleted]", "YTA for yelling. He\u2019s 12, he can\u2019t get a job and earn his own income legally. He shouldn\u2019t be stealing her stuff but take him to a dollar store and buy him some cheap make up. You could avoid this problem for under $50\u2026", "Buy him his own.", "YTA you don\u2019t have to scream at him, he is a kid. You could\u2019ve told him without screaming. Is your daughter your favorite child? Why don\u2019t you buy him some makeup?", "YTA if youndont want him using his sisters makeup facilitate him buying some for himself", "YTA. You could've handled this way better. You don't have to yell at your kids right away once they do something wrong. Especially when it's to this scale. Should he have done it? No, but you should've seen it coming as well considering he's expressed interest in it. Not to mention the fact that he's 12. He's still going to make mistakes. \n\n\nThe best course of action in my opinion would be to have asked your daughter to share one time to see if it's still interesting to him. Give them a chance to bond as brother and sister. Yes, makeup is very expensive, I'm fully aware, but, it would've been a better outcome than this, and with Christmas around the corner, you could've gotten some gift ideas for both of them.", "Info: I\u2019ve bought my son his own palettes so he doesn\u2019t mess with his sisters. Have you done anything to help him get his own makeup so he leaves hers alone? Or are you just punishing him for wanting to use makeup?", "A week is too harsh. I good talk about ways he can earn money to buy his own makeup is better. He for sure shouldn't use his sister's makeup without permission, but your punishment far outweighs the 'crime'.  A day or two would be sufficient. Also, figure out what he wants and maybe it can be a Christmas gift.", "NTA", "NTA, but work out a way for him to get some make up of his own. It\u2019s not ok for him to steal other peoples stuff and there need to be consequences for that. However, it seems like this is an important issue for him. \n\nMaybe a set of chores to earn himself a basic makeup kit of his own, like lawn mowing/ car cleaning/ windows cleaning etc. Then keep the discussion open and let him explore. He may want to branch out into clothes etc, and his sister is completely reasonable in feeling annoyed when he takes her stuff. Best to head that off before it becomes an issue- give him ways to earn his own clothes and makeup.", "NTA.  Thank you for standing up for your daughter and reinforcing the fact that her brother can't just steal from her.  I get that he's 12 so he probably doesn't have money from a job like his sister, but does he get allowance money, and would you take him to the store so he could purchase the makeup he likes (or you pay for half or all of the makeup, etc., depending on the situation)?  From now on, consider getting him Ulta, Sephora or Target gift cards for part of his birthday or Christmas gifts.", "NTA. Talk to your son.

It sounds like you were clear with him that this behavior of taking his sisters things or using them without her permission is wrong and he will be punished for it. So he did it and he was punished. Consequences are important.\n\nYou did the right thing by giving your daughter a lock so she can protect her stuff when she\u2019s out of the house.

If you're wife is ok with him using his sister's, then she can offer up her makeup. \n\nThere's also a level of sanitation that's being ignored.

He definitely needs to learn that he can\u2019t just used ppls things/steal. Stay firm on the punishment and talk to him about his actions? Then later.. Maybe buy him a pallet for Christmas?", "NTA. Sister bought her makeup with her own money and told him he couldn\u2019t take it. It\u2019s also very unhygienic to share makeup.

You can use this as a great teachable moment. \n\nMaybe he can mow the lawn or shovel snow for a little pocket money, and you can take him to the store with his sister and she can make some recommendations for his own stuff?

He should have to do something to benefit his sister like doing her chores for a few days.\nI also think you should provide him with some basic makeup (ulta often has great starter sets in Black Friday for super cheap). I usually provide my kids with a nice foundation because I think quality is important for that. Plus a few small cheap basics like from Elf. Anything nicer than that they have to buy themselves. They started to learn what was worth splurging for and when a budget item can do the trick . Maybe help him find an opportunity earn some money? He can decide if what he earns is worth spending on makeup or other items.", "if your wife thinks you're too harsh she can share with him her own expensive make up.

He can mow lawns, shovel snow, rake leaves and any number of other things. Stealing in never ok and rewarding it by gifting items similar to what was stolen is not a good thing to start.", "His 14 year old sister has been buying hers with her own money, so it wouldn\u2019t be fair to buy him his own and reward him for stealing the things she\u2019s bought with her own money.", "My biggest concern would be sexism by the school (ie makeup is banned but they turn a blind eye to girls or only allow girls to wear it). Good to allow him to wear it other places within reason.", "No school bans makeup here.\nYou can wear makeup in kindergarten. \nWhy would parents ban makeup in school if he buys it himself?", "I agree.", "he's 12, not 20. a fair punishment is doing extra chores, an apology to sister, replacing her missing makeup if he has an allowance, ect.", "Punishments don't induce change, they create feelings of shame and resentment. There are plenty of ways that this behavior can be addressed, but isolating a human from their support group and hoping they come to the right conclusions on their own is lazy parenting. There is no easy answer; children aren't dogs to be Pavlov'd into \"good behavior.\" It requires a long-term commitment to being consistent and understanding. My daughter is currently testing boundaries with truth telling, which is developmentally appropriate at her age. In response, we withhold rewards (no dessert after dinner or no tablet time, for example), we talk about the importance of boundaries, we brainstorm what it would feel like if other people were to tell us fibs and how that would make us feel, and we collectively agree on future expectations. This is super important because instead of punishing when a bad behavior appears, we withhold rewards for not meeting the agreed-upon expectations. It sounds like the same thing with extra steps, and it kinda is, but that's like the whole point. Parenting is about the extra steps.", "She buys herself Dior (lip oil $38).\n\nHe can get some elf (lip oil $6) until he can work and get whatever he wants.", "he\u2019s only 12, it\u2019s not like he can get a job. op should get him some cheap drugstore makeup as a christmas gift or something", "Then make it his Christmas present for this year", "Haha, skin care> makeup any day though.

Sis can identify what the colors are. I'll bet Dad can't. \n\nBut you're right. Which is why kid can't steal his sister's stuff and should get punished for it (Dad's not an AH there), Sis is understandably upset and is right to demand a lock if little bro won't respect understood boundaries (she's not an AH), kid almost certainly has no clue about any of the cost or health issues, and wasn't necessarily ready to get a tube of lipstick, just wanted to experiment and wanted to hide it being 12 and all - should know better, but with understandable fear of having to admit he wants to experiment combined with being a kid, I'm not going to call him an AH, though I agree he should get grounded for violating his sister's privacy and stuff, and Mom is defending him, just the wrong aspect of the issue so she isn't an AH either.

The situation could've been handled better. He needs to learn to ask before taking, yes, but you are acting as if he's a 17 year old kid with a fully developed moral compass and is doing it with the intent of harm and taking their expensive makeup.

Even if he doesn't work for someone else, he could earn money through taking on more responsibility at home.", "Sure maybe the kid is old enough NOW to earn money, BUT do you think the parents waited until their daughter could afford to buy their own makeup to let her get some? They should sit down with the kid and explain that using without permission and sharing makeup is a bad idea. Then they should buy him his own kit.
