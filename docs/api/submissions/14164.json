I (f18) live with my mom (f47), dad (m49), and younger brother (m14). My younger brother has been dating his girlfriend (f13) for a little under a year now. I honestly never expected it to last so long since they're so young, but they both seem happy so I'm happy for them.\n\nMy brother's girlfriend has had a very difficult life. I'm not really sure of all of the details, but I know her parent's don't have custody of her and she lives with her grandparents who are a half hour away. My family helps out a lot, we drive her to school in the morning and feed her breakfast, sometimes even feed her lunch and dinner, and let her sleepover so her grandparents don't have to pick her up so late.  I don't mind doing this at all, but it is a lot on my parents since it's almost like they have a new child now. She spends more time at our house than her grandparents.\n\nMy brother's girlfriend has been nothing but nice to me. However, sometimes I do get annoyed at how often her and my brother hangout. They always kiss in front of me which makes me uncomfortable because like ew who want's to see their younger brother kiss. My brother also told me they have sex often and I was honestly shocked due to how young they both are. I would never tell my parents but I feel like it's disrespectful of them to have sex while we're all home. I know they're not doing it anywhere else cause they never hang out at her grandparents house and they can't drive. \n\nJust for some context before this next part, my family has a beach house we stay at during the summer where my brother and I both work, so we basically live there the whole summer. Anyways, fast forward to a couple days ago I see my brother's girlfriend made a post on her private snapchat story saying she applied for her first job. I slid up and asked where she applied to, and she said the name of a place in the beach town where our beach house is at. I asked her if her family had a beach house she could stay at while she worked but she said no, and that she was going to play it by year. Now I know she's young so I can't be that upset at her but like, why would you apply to a job at a place where you don't have a house at. And the beach town is 2 hours from where we all normally live. So I figured she is most likely going to end up staying with us. Which is honestly too much for me, like consecutive months of her and my brother having sleepovers and most likely sex, like no. So I told my mom about this and she told me that she said it was okay if my brother's girlfriend lived with us and already talked about it with my brother's girlfriend. I was really upset with her because she didn't even consider how I felt at all. And I think she's insane for letting them sleepover for like three months considering how young they are. Also I just want to say that I am no way in shape upset at my brother's girlfriend, just my mom.\n\nAITA and should i be more understanding due to my brother's girlfriend's family situation.", "created_utc": 1680797732, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dp6rs/aita_for_getting_upset_at_my_parents_for_allowing/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're young teens and dating, that's a disaster of a recipe.      \nThey're already smooching in front of the family, what's going to happen when her and your brother get the beach house for the summer...she ends up pregnant.  This year or next.      \n      \nWhat's worse, what happens to her situation if the relationship sours?  What if it doesn't sour?

Unfortunately they will probably be raising their grandchild in the near future. I don't think you have a right to be mad that they are helping her and allowing her to live with them, you should have a heart to heart with your parents about the sex. They both need a sit down and a talk about what is expected while living together. This isn't your expectations but your parents. Ultimately its up to them. Again helping is good, but setting them up for failure can only end poorly.", "NTA.

They are welcome to spend the summer at the beach but you won\u2019t be going with them because you don\u2019t want to live with your brother\u2019s middle school girlfriend anymore.\n\nMake your parents make a choice. They can have you around a lot or her around a lot. What they choose will allow you to factor that knowledge in when making life decisions.\n\nIt would be different if you demanded her not be around at all.

Bad for family. \n\nI don't care if the OP's parents are deadbeats or wealthy or in-between. What they're doing is wrong. Because it IS illegal, _other_ people can call CPS, like neighbors, teachers, the GF's grandparents if she turns up pregnant, parents of their friends, etc. There are so many people in a community who can see this and think, \"This is wrong.\" Stop thinking the OP or I'm trying to bust the parents.

And its not like shes vacationing or something, its for a JOB OPPORTUNITY.\n\nI commend your parents for giving her these great opportunities and helping her through life. I do feel they could have discussed this with you but ultimately it is they\u2019re decision.\n\nAlso doubling back, your upset because your brother and his gf, whom you already know are having sex, might have sex at the beach house. This is the real issue. Why have you not informed your parents that these BARLEY TEENAGERS are HAVING LIKELY UNPROTECTED SEX?? What do you think is going to happen if she gets pregnant? Who is going to raise the baby? \n\nTELL YOUR PARENTS YOUR BROTHER AND GF ARE HAVING SEX SO THEY CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH YOUR BROTHER AND HIS GF BECAUSE THIS IS NOT NORMAL!!", "YTA\n\nYou can't control what decisions your parents make on this issue. You can have a conversation with them about your concerns, but you don't get to dictate what they decide to do. They may have information you do not.\n\nYou can, however, control how you react to things and what you do next. Have you had a chat with your brother about the importance of birth control? This would be my primary concern. Because becoming parents before the age of 15 is a real concern here. As the older sibling, and given that your brother has confided in you that they are sexually active, having a conversation about the responsibility that goes along with having sex would seem warranted.", "YTA!  It's pure jealousy.  Your 18 and an adult.", "YTA If you know they are having sex you need to inform your parents. They also need to make sure that they are legally allowed to have the GF live with them. They may have already done this but you can ask about it.\n\nAs far as caring about seeing your brother kiss just don't look at it. You don't seem to care about the real potential issues just are upset that your brother's GF is living with you.", "YTA. you're not paying the bills and it isn't your business what your brother and his gf do. sorry but unless there is something about this situation that is actually impacting your life in a real, material fashion you are simply being controlling.", "YTA. Your parents are fine with the situation and it's there property and there lives involved in it. Your 18, plenty old enough to move out if your don't like it.

You're annoyed for the wrong reasons. She's a vulnerable child and if your parents were giving her a safe space that would be great.

You're trying to argue against me, saying CPS doesn't care, but I'm saying don't do things that will get CPS called to the house because one doesn't want CPS involved in the family. You know.

I don't recall either of these things. I stated that the OP's parents needed to deal with the issue in their home _before_ CPS became an issue. No one wants CPS to become a part of their lives. My husband quit after two years because he said it sucks your soul away. He says CPS is necessary for the child abusers harming their families, or those who need financial help, but families should try to never get CPS involved if they can avoid it.  Once they're involved, it's hard to get them uninvolved.", "I'm harassing you? **tilts head** When? I answered a question from what I knew. Then I asked my husband for his expertise and passed that information along. That's considered harassment? Interesting.", "If you think I'm lying, look it up. In the United States, the majority of states have the age of consent at 16. The other states have it at 17 or 18. The only way to change this, if they're under the age of consent, is if they're married. This 13-year-old and 14-year-old are well below the age of consent, aren't married, and are given tacit permission by the OP's parents. This makes the parents culpable for allowing illegal activities involving children. It's essentially allowing the 2 underage children to cohabitate, though one is too young to make this kind of decision, they're not her legal guardians, and have given her no legal security to safeguard her (like marriage or foster care).", "I\u2019m not an adult I\u2019m 18 I\u2019m still a kid luckily but I\u2019ve dealt with CPS since I was a baby. I realize it\u2019s just how it\u2019s setup but being on the receiving end of the setups too many times to count along with my brother and sisters it doesn\u2019t work. And yea I agree they\u2019d prolly put the 13 yr girl back with her grandparents. But maybe CPS isn\u2019t the right ducking option maybe talk to ur fuckinb parnts and try to have a civil discussion abt not letting her 13 and 14 yr kids fuck in ur house. They probably don\u2019t even know abt it I don\u2019t think ur 14 yr son is gonna go blabbing around the house saying he\u2019s sleeping with his 13 yr gf. Yea the parents still need to be more attentive and aware and CPS IS NOT THE FUCKING OPTIOKNNOMGGGG ITS NOT THE OPTOON. Just I\u2019m done wherever I don\u2019t have any opinion on this post tbh just cps is bad there rly fucking bad people I\u2019m telling u maybe not the individuals themself but some of them yea it\u2019s mostly just the system but whatever I don\u2019t rly go on rants like this but cps is bad people think there so good and they help all these worse case scenario cases and sure they have to make things a little difficult to the other to rly help the ones that need it BUT THATS NOT HOW IT IS they don\u2019t give a fuck abt the children or parents just follow there job mandate report court take out the home or some other shitty stressful event there bad bad bad fucking people", "He works in CPS. He trained and it\u2019s now his career. He chose to work in a fucked up messed up system to ruins children\u2019s lives AND parents lives. Yes I\u2019m personally attacking her husband and every other sole that works in CPS. It\u2019s like waiting your whole life to be judge just to have power over people. Even if that\u2019s not why you went into the career, your still in the career. ESPECIALLY talking about prosecuting parents over letting there kids have sex. Maybe a parenting course or two no. Abusive home no sex abusive parents go to court your bad and stupid. Liek no jsut fuck no CPS is bad they were horrible when I was six and there were horrible up till I\u2019m 18 they even made me show up to a CPS hearing after I was 18 over truancy which they found my mother responsible for. Jsut I\u2019m done they aren\u2019t good people it\u2019s more then just a fucked up system it\u2019s literally taking away children\u2019s basic human rights to be alive.", "Yea well doing anything at all will get them called. I was on juvenile probation for a year a half and I was required to atleast talk about my life a little bit. But I had to be so fucking careful abt what I said because if I said anything even remotely somewhat could be bad parenting she\u2019d say she\u2019s a mandated reporter and that she\u2019d have to report that. I remember one time she even fuckin sent them over bc my mom stopped buying food but like I had a job I can just buy my own food and she buys her own food during work and my brother gets food stamps and buys his own like how tf is that abuse I openly said I\u2019m fine with my mom not buying food for the house anymore it wasn\u2019t even like a symptom of psychosis or anything she just didn\u2019t have a whole lot of money and I said you don\u2019t need to rly buy food in the house I usually just buy a chipotle after work anyways. But she still sent them to my house for that unexpectedly. She directly said to me jsut watch what you say but u still need to tell me abt how ur life\u2019s going it made it rly stressful but it wasn\u2019t her fault honestly I\u2019m mostly mad abt 1 thing in the system and that\u2019s the fuckin horrible idea of mandated reporting. Never got over the anxiety of mandating reporting made me scared to talk to adults even the tiniest bit. Even in school i could be an asshole and just never talk to adults but they still reported me to CPS they said my clothes were always destroyed and I smelled with bad hygiene like ok I\u2019m a high schooler how tf does that constitute child abuse stay tf out of my life like why would u do that ur gonna to give a child a panic attack and make him cry bc his mom didn\u2019t dress him perfectly for a preppy fucking middle class public school. Everyone mandated reports you even therapists have mandated reporting laws everyone does what the fucking point to even talk as a child in then like it just made my anxiety disorder sooooooo much worse specifically mandated reporting on top of that anyone who wants any resentment towards u can jsut easily report you. My mother burned a lot of bridges and my brother being a big one. My brother could literally just report anything they\u2019d show up to the house it was like a routine. Also gave me anxiety cause when I talked to my brother abt some of the more fucked up stuff mom was doing hed report that and I eventually just cut ties with him I think he only wanted to fuck over mom anyways.", "Alright thank you I respect your husband and I feel for him more than anyone I understand how soul draining it must have been to work there. I will say when I was on juvenile probation my probation officer helped me a lot with stuff and she really did care even when the juvenile probation system wasn\u2019t the best still heaven compared to CPS tho. But I really could see how soul draining it was for her to be in the situation she was in but she made good out of it and she was a good fucking PO. She cared abt her kids and wanted what\u2019s best even if it made her job like a million times harder. I don\u2019t know if your husband was like that but I definitely understand the mental stress and pressure he had to go through if he quit after 2 years of suffering through that. But still I think he might lack some of the feelings of what it\u2019s like for the children that are caught in shitty part of CPS.", " \n\n>tilts head\n\nOh god lol ok thanks goodbye!", "I'm saying the 14 might have been lying about having sex. She was already freaked out about him kissing a girl , maybe he just said it to get a reaction.", "So you say it\u2019s \u201cTacit permission\u201d over a post that an 18 yr girl made because she doesn\u2019t want another person staying with them and leaves out all other information about the relationship between them and there parents. Who\u2019s to say there parents aren\u2019t always having eagle eyes on them and they sleep in different rooms and everything? Just because they have sex does not mean there parents gave them \u201ctacit permission\u201d especially when there parents don\u2019t even know they\u2019ve ever had sex.", "I will say that my husband, having once worked for them, will be the first to say to do everything one can to fix whatever the problem is because one doesn't want CPS involved. That they're the last place you want your children to be because you don't want your kids in the system. However, he also believes that sometimes some children's lives are so messed up they can only survive through the system.", "Different people work in CPS and have you had any personal experience with their husband. I\u2019m gonna guess not. Go get yourself some therapy man, because you know what, angrily projecting your insecurities onto someone else who you have never even met before makes you just as bad as the people in your life who have projected their issue onto you.", ">He works in CPS. He trained and it\u2019s now his career.\n\nI said he _worked_ in CPS. 2 years doesn't a career make. He's a professor now. Chill out.\n\n>ESPECIALLY talking about prosecuting parents over letting there kids have sex.\n\nThis could happen if they don't change the situation. They have a 13-year-old child essentially cohabitating with their son. This is illegal. In one or two states in the United States girls at the age of 14 can get married, but none in the United States can at 13. Besides, the OP's parents aren't able to make that decision since they aren't her legal guardians. Sorry, but that's the law.", "What you described would make me paranoid too. When I read this, and the fact that you may not always have perfect hygiene, it made me think, not automatically that your mom's being screwy so we need to take you out, but that maybe we need to have you talk to someone who can take their time with you. Someone who you could come to trust. It sounded more like depression than outright neglect. Unfortunately, there's a couple of reasons CPS becomes the way it does. 1. There's a gazillion cases and not enough people. 2. The really nice folks who go in wanting to help kids, like my hubby, get pushed out. It's the hard people who stay, who get their souls burned. My husband said you can only hear child abusers talking about their need to harm children, or the other kind, where they can't help themselves touching them, so many times before it starts to change you. He got out before it changed him too much.", ">But still I think he might lack some of the feelings of what it\u2019s like for the children that are caught in shitty part of CPS.\n\nI'm not sure about that. CPS is a governmental machine. I think you're mistaking the workers for the machine. Do you think the workers don't get frustrated and angry about the machine and how they're simply cogs in it?", "Ah!!! You're right. It's still something to consider and discuss with the rents just in case, but also something worth considering in case he's lying. Excellent point!", "A GF stays overnight regularly. (It's why the OP needs to let her parents know.) To think teens won't have sex is foolhardy. To allow them to sleep over continuously is tacit permission. Parents know better. It's not rocket science. We're not complete idiots.", "Yea therapy would have helped a lot actually. I still need therapy desperately but it\u2019s too late. CPS wanted to throw my parents, me, and everyone else in this world in court. Where they say oop I\u2019m a judge it kinda looks like ur a bad parent u don\u2019t deserve this kid doesn\u2019t rly matter what he thinks. Oh ur abusing hard drugs and have constant panic attacks anxiety and suicidal thoughts every time before bed right therapy doesn\u2019t seem like the right option let\u2019s go put u in Christ\u2019s home with a bunch of other drug addicts away from ur home. Idc personal experiences or not man he chose to work in that career and that career is fucked I\u2019ve dealt with maybe 50 different people some social workers coming to my house every now and then cause someone wanted to ducking mandate report some bullshit and cause all this stress in the house just so I don\u2019t get fucking taken away just no ur wrong if u work In that career u don\u2019t have a concious ur a sick person who gets to see children\u2019s and parents lives go down the drain every day I would genuinely end of my life if I had to work in that career I would cry myself to sleep. No idc if I don\u2019t know him", "No you only see it by the way the law does. Not by common sense. This post was made by there 18 yr sister. She said in the post that she\u2019d \u201cNever\u201d tell her parents that they were having sex. So we have 2 very wealthy parents with a 14 yr son who has a 13 gf with a probably somewhat bad/stressful home life. Again this story is depicted through an 18 yr sister who doesn\u2019t want another person living with her on her vacation. No a 13 and a 14 yr shouldn\u2019t be having sex but it\u2019s the world it\u2019s happens? If you want to have sex your going to have sex as a teenager ask any parent or any teenager and they\u2019ll tell you. That\u2019s all we know. Doesn\u2019t sound like abuse to me. Doesn\u2019t even sound like neglect. It sounds like she should talk to her parents or at the very least her brother and explain the situation. It sounds like they have a good relationship and can talk to each other about personal things, especially if he\u2019s telling her he\u2019s having sex. I\u2019ll tell you she calls CPS that relationship is down the drain for a long time. Over pretty much nothing or atleast something that could have and should have easily be handled at home.", "Fuck I need to stop typing I think I just said all this because I quit nicotine 2 days ago and I was kept heart palps all night and couldn\u2019t sleep and I just woke up angry and read cps and yea I kinda freaked out sry I\u2019m listening to music now and I\u2019m calming down I\u2019m going to smoke a bowl and get ready for work have a great day and good luck in ur life!", "Also not saying that he didn\u2019t experience different kind of mental struggles in that situation im sure it was genuinely really hard. But he doesn\u2019t know the specific troubles of what it\u2019s like going through the system unless he has.", "Yea but the cogs arent the ones with emotions. Unless you were put in that situation you can only know so much of what it feels like. If were abused by your father growing up would you say someone who wasn\u2019t abused by there father would be able to understand that pain? Probably not. It might not seem like a reasonable comparison but it is CPS can be very traumatizing.", "It is just my own perspective on things. I don't know one way or the other. Just don't want it to blow up in anyone's face.", "I understand that and yea I agree and boundaries need to be set. But again there teens who want to have sex, there going to have sex. They probably sleep in other rooms and have boundaries already that just aren\u2019t mentioned in the post. Aside from completely separating them there isn\u2019t much they can do. In my first relationship when I was 15 I lived with him for abt a year cause it was a million times better than my home. His parents loved me and we always got along great but she still put a lot boundaries down. She check in on us at random times and would have to be in a room with open doors. But at the end of the day we still found time to have sex, because we\u2019re teenagers it is just part of growing up. Yea 13 and 14 is too long 15 is prolly even too young for most but it\u2019s just kinda growing up? Why should parents have to deal with a fucked up stressful situation for something that can easily be handled at home, and I\u2019ll emphasize EASILY. CPS is far from easy it\u2019s traumatizing and difficult for everyone, especially threatening parents with legal action for just doing WHAT THEY THINK is right.", "But here\u2019s the thing. You admit you need therapy, but instead of advocating for yourself and finding a therapist for yourself or finding local support groups for yourself, you\u2019d rather instead complain about how f*cked your life was. And yeah it was, I\u2019m not denying that and I feel for any kid that was abused, but it\u2019s you that has to advocate for yourself because believe it or not, attacking someone else\u2019s husband who you\u2019ve never met before only makes your issues worse and it paints you as being just as bad as everyone else in your life who treated you like sht. You admit you need therapy, then go get it, because guess what man, doing shrooms everyday isn\u2019t the answer. If it wasn\u2019t right for people to treat you badly, why is ok for you to treat people who you don\u2019t even know badly? Grow up man and start advocating for yourself for once instead of projecting your issues onto everyone else.\n\nEdit: \u201cTherapy could have helped a lot actually, but it\u2019s too late for that\u201d?

The OP's parents may be fine if their son is d*cking around, but they're not the legal guardians of the girl. For example, is she on birth control? Has anyone talked to her about this? Has anyone talked to her about how easy it is to get pregnant? What will the teens do if she gets pregnant? Have the OP's parents considered what they'll do if she gets pregnant? When you've got a son it's easier to not take it as seriously, but it's different when a girl is involved. And this girl has barely begun her life. And she's _not_ their legal responsibility.\n\nBeing in the system is traumatizing. I agree. It's why they should avoid it. And sure. Teens will have sex. They should be like most teens and sneak around trying to have it. Why would the parents risk their family just to allow 2 kids to cohabitate?", "NO FUCKINH SHIT?!?!?! I work full time I dropped out of school I begged everyday in school for therapt just anything I begged my mom I begged cps. I did everything the most that happened was the school said I could join a TIP program and they would give me a social worker to help find an apartment but I needed a mental diagnosis to qualify and my school couldn\u2019t help me with that they said go to aldergates and they would help me so I went to aldergate but they would not help me without my parent even though I had all my info my state ID my insurance card births certificate everything I could. Shrooms everyday? Yea I don\u2019t do shrooms. Shrooms are healthy. I do DXM a dissiacative that causes brain damage I dissociate every night because I fucking hate my life and yea I just avoid my problems now with drugs. I\u2019ve quit on my own twice because again I never had anyone to even kidna try to help me get off kfrugs do u know how fuckinb hard it is to stop a substance when you never had anyone ever parent u in ur life? The second I quit all my problems just come back to me and there\u2019s nothing I can do abt it. I want therapt I want a break I\u2019ve been working since I was 15 I never rly had close friends nothing I never got a break I need a fucking break I need help I need to get off drugs mentally and fucking physically too and I\u2019m only 18 I\u2019m sad I\u2019m depressed I\u2019m scared I\u2019m angry but DO NOT JUST FUCKING SAY GO TO THERAPY U DUMBFUCK", "Does a 13 YO actually think they will get a summer job?

My mom, who I honestly think had good intentions would let my 13yo bf stay over allll the time, eat with us, go to alllll the family functions, etc.  He did have a good family life, dirty house, mom was a druggie, stepdad was a druggie, siblings were neighborhood terrors\u2026. U get the picture.  He would also stay home after school with me\u2026.. alone.  Hmmmmmm what exactly do you think happened??  Fast forward a year I was tired of my mom putting his feelings first over mine, my poor dad agreed with me but didn\u2019t want to stand up to my mom.  So when I broke up with him I think my mom cried more than I did.  Then, he became manipulative and started blackmailing me into \u201cfavors\u201d that if I didn\u2019t do, he\u2019d tell my mom about our previous physical relationship ( which for the record was consensual at the time) For awhile I complied because I was terrified of my mom finding out.  Eventually I told her everything and she felt horrible that she put me in that situation to begin with.  I say all that to say this.

They can\u2019t consent to sex with an adult but again the closeness in age is considered under most state laws, even if one is 18 and the other 17. \n\nWhat\u2019s disturbing here are the particular facts of this case -such as what you mention -that the parents are largely permissive of this behavior under their care/ supervision.", "It's true you don't try them for statutory laws, but that's not the part of consent I'm focusing on. It's the parents, who are of legal age, we're focused on. They cannot condone and allow the cohabitation and sexual intercourse of these two children who are under the age of consent. Not unless both they, as the brother's legal guardian, come to an agreement with the GF's legal guardian that they can get married. In many states in the U.S. underage marriage is still allowed as long as a legal guardian okays it.\n\nWhy does the law enforce this? Because at this moment the GF has no power. She has no standing in their home other than their good will. She may unconsciously, or realistically, feel she has to give her BF sex in order to stay there. She may get pregnant and they may kick her out. The BF may grow tired of her, and kick her out, thus changing her style of life. Her life is too tumultuous right now. The law enforces marriage for young ones to give them power in these situations. It's sad, but it makes sense.\n\nThe fact that the BF's parents have no legal standing over the GF, but are putting her in jeopardy, is illegal. They're making her situation worse, even if she likes their nice house and meals. The law wants to protect children, and the OP's parents aren't doing what's best for her. What would be best? Drive the 30 minute drive to drop her off at her GP's home. It's just easier on them not to drive and let her stay. But that's not best for her.", "Absolutely, the facts of this case are disturbing, the cohabitation is a major concern. The environment isn\u2019t acceptable, and both youth are at risk. It\u2019s coercive even if the acts of the minors between themselves aren\u2019t inherently so, perhaps I should have been more clear about that. I agree with you this is a NTA situation.", "If you read the above comment I wasn\u2019t going after her husband at all anymore.
