{"id": 31670, "submission_id": "18371ee", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to make an effort to lock the doors when he leaves for work while our toddler and I are sleeping?", "selftext": "My husband leaves for work before my 1 year old and I wake up. On a few occasions he's left the back door unlocked after letting our dog out in the morning. I woke up this morning to discover that the back door was unlocked again. He said sorry but I told him I need more than that, like taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. This upset him and now it's turned into an argument.\n\nThis may bother me more than the average person as I have OCD and need the doors locked. I always keep them locked when I'm home, especially when I'm sleeping, and check the doors many times before going to sleep at night.\n\nHis arguments:\n- it wasn't on purpose and he said sorry \n- we just moved to this house 5 months ago and it takes a while to form habits due to his adhd (side note: he did do this at our old place up until we moved, although not as frequently)\n- house break-ins are rare\n- we live in a good neighbourhood\n- I've left his car unlocked on multiple occasions and he didn't say anything\n\nETA: Some are focusing on my OCD as the main reason for needing the doors locked but I just wanted to clarify that general safety concerns are the main reason. The OCD just adds another level to my concern which I guess is making me wonder if I'm overreacting and, therefore, TA.\n\nETA: Thanks everyone for the thoughtful responses and suggestions! I'll discuss some of the strategies with my husband.\n\nETA: Some want to know how many times. I've commented at least 3 in the last 5 months. I wasn't keeping count but I remember pointing out last time that it wasn't the first time so at least 3. I threw that frequency out off the cuff as that's how long we've lived here but some are so focused on that to the point of doing the math. I figure if we want to be that specific I should also mention he was on leave for the first 2 months of us living here and has had to go out of town for work for various stretches, so it's more like over 2-3 months.\n\nETA: Some think I omitted information about when it was brought up on purpose. If that was the case I wouldn't have mentioned it in my comments. I'll clarify here for everyone:\nI initially texted \"you left the back door unlocked\". He texted back \"whoops sorry\".\nWhen he came home for his lunch break there was no animosity and we interacted as usual. It came up and I told him that it was upsetting for me. He said he was sorry but I told him I needed more than that, like steps he could take to make sure it doesn't happen again. He made the arguments mentioned above. I thought it would be a quick \"sure next time I'll try x, y, z\" but it spiraled. Some are assuming I freaked out on him but I cannot stress enough how far from the truth this is. I was just looking for a solution moving forward. He admitted that I was calm and he got worked up.\nWe've since discussed it and I said in the future I won't bring up any issues on his lunch break. He said that was unnecessary, but that today he was tired and not in the right frame of mind, but that would have been the same after work as well. I do think a blanket \"wait til after work\" is a good rule of thumb moving forward regardless.\nI did my best to present an unbiased case, including his arguments, otherwise, what's the point of an AITA post?", "created_utc": 1700872981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18371ee/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_make_an_effort_to/", "score": 332, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bit dirty from walking.  \n\nI soon found the country home he lived in because his neighbours pointed it out.  No one answered the door.  So I called the provincial police which (unknown to me) was 2 minutes away.  I told them I found a child on the highway alone.

Door was closed but the child figured out how to open the door.  He then played on the acre property before kicking a ball down the highway where I had found him. \n\nFather was asleep when I had knocked on the door and also when the police knocked.  Turns out the wife came home about 20 minutes after I left and was understandably having a total meltdown at what had just happened.  Police officer told me they were glad they weren\u2019t the husband at that moment. \n\nI think about that day often because that child could have easily have been killed and likely would have if I or someone else hadn\u2019t stopped.  \n\nYou are definitely NTA.", "A keyless automatic door lock will solve the issue.

You want him to lock the door to protect his wife and his child from being murdered, and he\u2019s like, but what if someone stole the spare change in my car!?! Insane.", "Op, I have comorbid adhd AND ocd. So I kind of understand both sides, and my vote is a gentle ESH.\n\nGentle because I understand both why you need this, and why he was upset. Often adhd people (myself included) struggle with something called rejection sensitivity, which is often triggered by things other than rejection- for example, the \u201cnot enough\u201d feeling. By saying you need more than that, it\u2019s possible he was triggered and it upset him because his brain is telling him he fucked up, he\u2019s not doing enough, he\u2019s stupid, whatever. All false, obviously, but brains lie. \n\nAs someone who also has OCD, I understand that even the thought that the door MIGHT be unlocked can trigger SO much anxiety that you can\u2019t function unless you KNOW it\u2019s locked. So not having that reassurance from him that he\u2019s going to go above and beyond to endure it? Stressful as fuck. \n\nI think what needs to happen here is clearer communication without the arguing. I struggle with communication, so one thing that helps me is writing. Sometimes our brain disorders make it hard to get the words out of our mouths the way they\u2019re going in our heads. So writing them down makes us slow down and get them out properly, without the added stress of live reactions. \n\nIf you write down why this is an issue for you, and he writes down why this is an issue for him, and you\u2019re both honest about what the situation is making you feel and think, you can read what the other wrote and then come back and discuss it with the knowledge of the other persons\u2019 POV. \n\nThe hardest part is seeing and acknowledging your own reactions and emotions. \n\n\nSo really, it\u2019s less that you both suck, and more that you\u2019re not communicating as clearly as you could and having trouble seeing from different perspectives. Totally normal, but also fixable with the right steps. \n\nGood luck OP. Xx", "Why wouldn't he lock the damn door?

This is about how you both talk about the lock.\n\nIf this is such a big conflict, it's either because you're approaching it aggressively, he's responding defensively, or both.\n\nIt's fair for you to express your needs, and expect him to make an effort to accommodate them.  It's also fair for him to expect some grace when he slips, and kindness when you address it with him.  And when you address it with him kindly, he should respond with understanding for your feelings and needs.\n\nSomeone there needs to treat the other with more gentleness, empathy and love.\n\nAnd I bet it's both of you.", "I\u2019m on the fence. It would be more of an issue if it was the front door, but it\u2019s the back door. And while it bugs you, you\u2019re also asleep it doesn\u2019t directly trigger any issues for you when it happens but rather after the fact.\n\nAlso give you\u2019ve left his car unlocked which makes it a higher risk of being stolen and broken into, and depending on the car your garage door clicker being taken/cloned, or if bills/sensitive documents are left in it or laptop/etc. I think you should give him grace because not even you remember to lock something all the time that has a high risk as well.

Like I\u2019m scatterbrained sometime but I NEVER forget to lock my doors", "Your kid is getting older. It is only a matter of time before you wake up and your kid is out in the garden alone. Is it enclosed? Childproofed? \n\nHe needs to get into the habit...", "NTA,  this is important to you, but think about changing the lock to something that will automatically lock from the outside and you can open it from the inside.  Be careful not to lock yourself out, though.", "100% NTA.", "NTA, \n\nI would try an auto locking door lock. You can get digital locks that you can put a code into, or fingerprint to get back in if you accidentally lock yourself out.", "Write a note in very large print saying 'Lock Me' and pin it to the door to remind him.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t have ADHD but I do have normal concerns for myself and my family. My husband didn\u2019t get the lock the door thing originally but I pointed out to him that I am more likely to be raped and murdered if an opportunistic offender can simply walk in.  Praise up what a good provider he is, but add his job also includes Protector. And he is not doing that.", "In spite of what you want to insist, your OCD is the problem here. Your husband is doing what he can. You can easily get up when he does. You don't need to wake up your toddler. You are obsessing over this and neglecting other things, like leaving the car unlocked is much more likely to allow someone to break into it than would ever be the case for your house. Get up when he does and obsessively lock the door to your heart's content. Nothing is stopping you.", "Yes", "[removed]", "You need to sit him down and have him watch some crime shows.   That will hopefully get him to straighten his act up.  Huge yikes\n\nNAH imo just really needs to be shown what can happen.   This isn't something to take lightly.", "NTA. Locking doors is a safety step to ensure everyone stays safe. The only way people like this learn is when their house gets robbed and realize its because they left a door unlocked or a window open.. After that, they remember to lock their doors.", "From the opening . . . You're dealing with a Idiot.", "How will he feel if he comes home for lunch and something has happened to his family? \n\nNTA", "I love this idea on paper but oh god I would lock myself out all the time.", "Especially because if something were to happen, all it takes is the one time. One time for your life to permanently change forever. When a big step to preventing that is to take 10 seconds to lock the doors? Seems like a small sacrifice to me", "Yes, I think this is something men just don't naturally get.  My husband always used to leave the doors unlocked too.  The difference though is that when I explained how important it was to me, he understood and started locking them.  It's dangerous.  NTA.", "Same I have ADHD and my partner has a compulsion around locked doors (I would guess they have OCD but it's not a formal diagnosis so I don't want to be wrong about that). Every night I do my 'checks' as my bedtime routine. The ADHD brain is forgetful but loves chunked/stringed habits (ex, if I shower, I brush my teeth right after; when I wake up I take out the dog and prep his breakfast; if I'm going upstairs I check all the locks). So there are practical solutions like self locking doors but there's also working with your brain to really prioritize not only your partners needs but also general safety concerns", "It's not a big deal because: 1) he didn't do it intentionally, 2) he immediately apologized, 3) he literally has ADHD, 4) they are in a new home that they just moved in 5 months ago so it's not a deep routine yet, 5) it's not a daily, weekly, or even monthly occurrence for him.\n\nAlso, OP is a hypocrite because she says she literally forgot to lock the doors to his car the same amount of times as he's accidentally left the back door unlocked", "Unless there is a road running through their backyard I think the toddler is safe", "So then she\u2019s way too old to be using her OCD as a reason right?", "Lol I like it", "Interesting with the weird time, I'll mention it! Thanks!", "I second the visually annoying sign - my last place I hated because it locked behind you SO easily and me and my housemates got locked out multiple times this way... so what did we do? GIANT sign saying \"KEYS.\" in all caps. We stopped forgetting after that :D", "As someone from Germany, where house doors that can be opened without a key from the inside but require a key from the outside are the norm, this is just a baffling sentence. Do no Germans never lock themselves out. Sure they do. But to declare a safety feature an inherently bad idea, because of one scenario where you're scatterbrained? Weird.", "My mum had a very similar thing hapen when I was little.  When she asked who it was, they ran off.  Several single women in the street had the same thing happen.", "you have no right to tell someone how to feel safe in their own home. especially when they're a woman, especially when they have children in the house, and especially when they're sleeping. calling someone dramatic for getting upset at not having their doors locked when they and their kids are sleeping inside is just straight up bizarre.", "He's brushing you off.  Most break-ins and rapes you never even hear about.  If your child is crawling they could also get out.", "My husband also brushed off my complaints about safety and locking our door when he left early in the morning for work. \nHe only realised my complaints were valid after a drunk guy walked into our house at 4:30am one morning thinking it was his friend\u2019s house. The drunk guy became argumentative and hostile when told he had the wrong house, luckily my husband was still home at the time and kicked him out. He took my concerns on board after that and we were lucky it didn\u2019t end in a worse situation.", "Yes, especially with ADHD.", "I just feel locking the door is part of life like making sure the stove is off. I have the opposite issue. If I don't have a memory of it it didn't happen, blowing out candles, turning off the coffee pot. A thought will pop into my mind and I cant rest until I know the answer.", "no, not it at all and the karma response you're seeing should tell you you're prob wrong on how you interpreted that. I merely told that story to show where I was coming from. Lock the door, soldiers in the Army are taught to lock their barracks doors. Criminals lock doors and the husbands just says fuck it ill chance it? Then you want to try and twist this into something sexist. YTA not OP or me.", "I can't even have a spare key. I locked myself out, went to grab it, and it was gone.\n\nChanged the locks ASAP and suddenly all the weird stuff I thought was all in my head stopped. No more coming home to running faucets, or the dog uncrated or lights on that I could have sworn were off.  \n\n\nDid have to change banks after they tried to drain my bank account. (The bank caught it, contacted me, and still let the transactions go through.)", "I live alone. Earlier this year my pup started barking up a storm and I figured she had to be pee, so I got dressed, put my shoes on, and went from one end of the house to the other to go out the front door.\n\nShe doesn't have to pee so we go back in. Only my door wont close. The dead bolt wont turn, theirs scratching on the paint by the catchplate, and when I dissemble it at three AM (because I assume its stuck and needs to be manually unstuck) the metal innards are twisted.\n\nI had to pay someone to come out and drill out the locks and replace them- because whoever tried to force entry did some damage to the wood and I can't fix either of those on my own.\n\nI had previously changed my locks because a stalker had stolen my spare key and was using it to break in when I wasn't home.", "ok", "I just see it as lock the door as common courtesy, OP mentioned leaving the car door unlocked but that doesn't lead to death just loss of property. It wasn't something to get into a fight over esp if you're the one who didn't lock the door. Like, that's where the foot comes down, locking the door?  If you leave and nobody is awake yet it is your responsibility. I live in a nice area and I dated a girl from a not so nice area, she couldn't believe I didn't lock my doors going into the drug store. That week my car was broken into at work. You never know what's gonna happen even in good neighborhoods. I don't think she broke into my car, before that comes up.", "I had to look up what a reverse osmosis water filter was I'll be honest\ud83d\ude05 I always hold the kettle under the tap while I fill it up, it hurts my arm but i can't forget what I'm doing that way lol", "Am I the only person with ADHD who doesn't forget to lock the door behind themself?  Like, I'd attribute it to my stalker issue but, uh, I was locking the door behind me *before* I realized I had a creep problem. Actually found out I wasn't just going crazy because I locked myself out and my spare key was gone. (It ain't like I'm pretty either- I'm ugly as sin, so if it can happen to me it can happen to anyone. Lock your doors folks).", "cheers", "Maybe suggest he sets a timer for right before he leaves to remind him or a sticky note on the door", "Plenty of adults forget to lock the door every now and then.  I'm extra paranoid of my door being locked but even I might forget once every few months to lock the door behind me especially if I'm doing a bunch of stuff when entering.

I will say though that I also like locked doors while I'm in the house. Unless your husband is leaving at some ungodly hour, I'd just get up, make him a snack or breakfast or whatever, see him off and lock the door myself. It would just give me peace of mind and I also get to send my husband off. Win-win. \n\nIf you don't want to get up, that fine, no need to change your routine, but I'd just get a lock that is electrical. You can even check your phone to see if the door is locked, whatever. You can have the doors lo l 5 minutes after he leaves, etc. \n\nI would say bringing it up multiple times while he was home from work is not okay. Sometimes people do forget things, it's okay and it's normal, sometimes there isn't a *\"why\"* beyond that. You're also implying that he's making a choice to endanger his wife and child. That's very unfair, stop. Get up and make sure yourself or get locks that lock themselves.", "NTA \n\nAs my mother always says- an apology isn\u2019t just an expression of remorse. It\u2019s a promise that you\u2019ll do all you can to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again. \n\nAs someone with ADHD, when I apologize for something like this, it\u2019s actually helpful to me to be like \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I understand (impact) and going forward I\u2019m going to try and ensure I do x\u201d. It sort of ties it into my head better.\n\nIf he has a habit of apologizing but not doing much to ensure his habits are managed, I get why you felt the need for reassurance in the form of some intent or plan.", "NTA. He will regret that if a break in or murderer comes in.", "NTA. This is a safety issue. He needs to make the effort.", "NTA.  Put a sign on the door that he uses when he leaves for work in the morning.  It should list things like \"Lock all doors\", \"Is the stove off?\"  and anything else he tends to forget.  ADHD is not an excuse for potentially put you and your child in danger.", "1. NTA.\n2. Change your locks, get the sort that lock automatically when you close the door.

When my boyfriend was staying over for a few months, we'd developed a system where he'd text me that he'd locked the door when he left. The ritual helped him remember. He has unmedicated (but diagnosed) ADHD, but it still managed to work for him.", "NTA. We keep our doors locked all the time, too. But you could get up with him...just for a minute. Give him a hug and kiss, wish him a good day and lock the door behind him, then go back to bed. You will rest better when you know the door is locked rather than waking with worry. My husband does this, even on my occasional really early start days (4 AM as opposed to 6:30 AM).", "So im awful at remembering to lock the doors. And we don\u2019t live in the best neighborhood. \n\nUsually it\u2019s because I\u2019m coming in with groceries and forget. \n\nOr I let the dog back in the back door and I\u2019m usually doing something else. Like laundry or cooking. \n\nIt\u2019s not done on purpose. But it annoys my husband. \n\nInstead of arguing about it. We got self locking locks, with a key pad option to get back in, cuz lord knows if I can\u2019t remember to lock a door, I won\u2019t remember to grab my keys every time I walk out the door to take out the trash. \n\nOP invest in different locks and call it good.", "I\u2019m not sure about her husband, but I\u2019m super adhd and immediately imagined myself trying that and had to smh at myself. I just know I would 100% end up locking myself out of the house with an embarrassing frequency.", "Would it be BETTER and easier on you if he did it? Sure, but it has become a point of contention that you can solve in minutes. Which is more important?

Her husband is a total asshole for putting both his wife and child at risk by not locking the door. End of. \n\nProtecting them should be a primal extinct for him.", "How many times of your toddler wandering into the road does it take to remember to lock the door?", "All of the above! Other things too like when a service person needs to come in and I'm at work, I don't have to take the day off to have the furnace worked on. Also when it's -30 I don't need to worry that my kid is locked out if they forgot their key.", "That's mad scary. Glad you're okay. I trust when my dogs start barking that someone or something is outside. I used to leave my slider unlocked in case I came home and forgot to take my door key. I usually come in through the garage. I don't leave the slider unlocked any more.", "The reason it couldn't be that in my case is because the handle was being turned so slowly, it was clearly someone trying to hide the fact they were coming in, which a drunk person wouldn't feel the need to do.", "Idk I don't think it's possible to make a relationship work if you live in a 'one person is wrong' mindset - I think finding solutions that work for both of you is better than pushing some irredeemable evil onto people. I really feel like people are responding like there's roving hordes of mad max style raiders and if there were locked doors would stop them", "Typical backyard has a fence.\n\n1 year old is excessively unlikely to do that. They are typically unable to open unlocked doors, too small to reach the handle and can't walk.", "No, many, many, many people don't have fences. They're expensive and not a huge thing everywhere.\n\n1 year olds are very capable of opening doors, and are walking. And they do this weird thing where they grow.
