{"id": 128, "submission_id": "yiqbzi", "title": "AITA For Pissing Off My Husband?", "selftext": "I was driving my husband downtown to pick up his friend. Before departing, I asked him to inquire about the address. This is what I do whenever I travel downtown because parking is extremely limited. I ask the person I\u2019m picking up if there are nearby loading spots, parking, or offer an alternative if parking is limited. He said he confirmed the address and agreed to handle this if difficulties arise.\n\nOnce we arrived downtown, as I expected, the block was lined with \u201cNO PARKING\u201d and \u201cNO STOPPING ANY TIME\u201d signs. I pointed that out and kept driving. He asked me to perform an illegal U-turn. I refused, pointing at the sign prohibiting turns at the intersection. He said in frustration, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t done illegal things before!\u201d\n\nI asked him where I should stop and he said \u201cjust park here.\u201d I pointed to the \u201cNO PARKING\u201d sign and said I could not park. He directed me down the block and told me to stop. I refused, showing him the \u201cNO STOPPING ANY TIME\u201d sign. He said other people were stopped there. I said coldly that didn\u2019t mean I could break the law as well. He then raised his voice at me, \u201cYou\u2019re saying you can\u2019t park here nor there! You\u2019re stressing me out! You\u2019re blaming me and saying it\u2019s all my fault! Then just park where you want to!\u201d\n\nI replied stating nobody was blaming him and never said it was his fault. I told him he had agreed to handle this so I was not responsible for finding parking. I said this is why I asked him to do his due diligence of researching the area and inquiring his friend about parking near the address before we left. I told him this what I have to do every time we go out, and that it\u2019s not as easy as it looks. It may *seem* easy to him because when I drive somewhere, I already know where the parking is since I researched beforehand.\n\nNow I am wasting gas driving around in circles looking for parking because he did not do his research. Finally, he stormed out of the car and said he and his friend would Uber home. AITA for angering him?\n\nEDIT: He said I was being \u201ccondescending\u201d and it is true that my tone may not have been the most pleasant. When we left and he agreed to handle it, I knew this problem was going to come up even though he said he got it under control. I just bit tongue and didn\u2019t push it further because I already suggested he do his research first. He is a grown man and can do what he wants. \nOf course, when we got downtown and it was as I expected, I coldly and flatly said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t park there. No parking sign. Nope, can\u2019t stop. No stopping any time. Can\u2019t do a U-turn.
