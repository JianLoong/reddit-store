I work from home, every day from morning until late afternoon, about the same amount of hours as people with a normal 9to5 job.  During my working day I do most of the household (cooking, dishes, cleaning, laundry, groceries) as I like to multitask why am doing phone calls with my employees. I compete in powerlifting, that's why I work out 4 times per weeks + cardio most mornings. This schedule of working + household + 5 meals + workouts means that I am very busy on 2 or 3 of the weekdays.\n\nMy wife works 2, max. 3 days per week. She likes to spend her free time watching TV, scrolling social media, playing games and sometimes meets with her girlfriends for coffee or lunch.\n\nRecently my wife has been increasingly frustrated about how I spent my time and the way I eat.\n\nShe says I spend too much time in the gym, she acts like this was something new and something I haven't been doing in the 7 years we dated before getting married. She doesn't like to do sports and refuses to join me at the gym. Which I accept and never have been pushy about, although it would make me very happy. Regarding this I have to mention that I spend approx. 2-3 nights during the weekend and almost every weekend completely with her. Also I take time to travel with her, just this year I took her to Germany, Turkey, Croatia, France and Bali.\n\nFurthermore, she is upset that I, except for the occasional cheat meal on the weekend, eat healthy most of the time and therefore she \"cannot\" eat dinner with me. Also she is upset that I eat breakfast without her, the reason for that being is that I wake up earlier than her and have to eat before I start working. I offered to align our dinner times. So that we eat our dinners at the same time, but that is not enough for her. She insists on me eating the same thing as her, as she refuses to eat my food and also refuses to cook something she does not like. She is also saying that I am at fault for her gaining a lot of weight in the last months (no complains about that, she is so beautiful), since me eating diet food forced her to order fast food every evening because she doesn't know how to cook only one portion.\n\nSo, long story short, am I the asshole for having my own life and indirectly causing my wife to gain weight?", "created_utc": 1689193657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14xzoa0/aita_for_having_my_own_life_and_a_schedule_which/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m single and live alone. Most foods are easy to freeze the leftovers or keep fine in the fridge to have the next night.", "NTA.  Your wife is filled with excuses, and is trying to sabotage your fitness because she's insecure.", "NTA\n\nAlso you are not causing your wife to gain weight, she's just trying to avoid taking responsibility for her choices and blaming you instead of trying to make better ones.", "NTA.\n\nYou two are separate people with your own likes and dislikes, and it's not your fault she's gaining weight. It sounds more like she's projecting a body insecurity on you and might feel a little neglected (not like I'm accusing you of neglecting her or the relationship, but if you're not spending time with each other it can be a factor). You did a good thing trying to make time for you two to have dinner together. Who doesn't love dinner with their S/O?\n\nShe chooses what she eats, and I think it's great that you're eating healthy. Maybe schedule a dinner with each other on your cheat day?\n\nEither way, you're both entitled to have your own lives and schedules. I would recommend sitting down with her, reminding her she's beautiful and you love her, and having a heart to heart.", "NTA. She\u2019s hating on herself for not having the willpower to work out like you do. I am embarrassed to say I started feeling this way with my partner. I didn\u2019t actually take it out on him, but internalised it until I realised I am actually my own worst enemy. And I need to get my ass up and work out.", "NTA, damn dude. Is there anything you weren\u2019t the cause of? I don\u2019t know why she is projecting all of her \u201cproblems\u201d on to you (I say \u201cproblems\u201d because as you\u2019ve mentioned, you are content with her whether she gains or loses weight) It sounds like you have already tried talking these things through with her, as you mention a lot of solutions that she has shot down. Maybe some therapy or marriage counseling to find out where her insecurities are and how she can deal with them in a healthy way instead of blaming you.", "NTA \nExcluding some kind of hostage situation\u2026 One person can\u2019t cause another person lose or gain weight.

Your wife has codependency issues and is having a hard time regulating her habits and patterns without you. It could be destructive to the relationship if she's not willing to address her emotional issues. She needs to be able to regulate herself and adjust or your lifestyles will continue to conflict.", "NTA", "NTA. She's mad at herself not you .", "Waitamin.\n\nBecause you are eating \"diet food\" your wife (who doesn't like it) is being forced to eat junk food and gain weight?\n\nThis, my friend, is the logic of a 6 year old. I should know I am parenting one right now.\n\nYour wife needs therapy.\nDesperately. Yesterday. For her codedency and inability to take responsibility for herself.\n\nHer behavior has nothing to do with you and yours. Nothing. She sounds miserable (and I mean that in the literal sense) and misery just loves company. She's not going to change so she's going to find ways to sneak in and try to change you. \n\nGet her to therapy.\nGo with her.\nFind out what's really going on.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't know how to cook her own food? How could it possibly be your fault that she doesn't lead a healthy lifestyle? Sounds like she is blaming you for her own problems.", "NTA. Never feel bad for bettering yourself, in the gym or in the kitchen. The weight gain is obviously messing with her mentally, and it\u2019s only increased by seeing you stick to your diet and lifting routine.", "Mate, you are NTA.   Your partner is projecting massively. \n\nYou may find there are some insecurities at the bottom of it, but that doesn't make it right either.  Partner needs to be accountable for her own choices and she needs to let go of the unreasonable desire to control what you are doing.  Eating together at tea is great, but you certainly do not have to change the food you eat because she doesn't wish to eat it and her excuses are weak at best.  Can't cook an individual portion?  That's okay, she can put the other portion in the fridge or freezer for a different day.", "She\u2019s blaming you for her own choices you married a fucking child", "NTA.", "NTA, it seems there are some incompatibility issues here, and some insecurity issues your wife has. Seems like she wants to drag you down with her. I'm not understanding how she isn't working 5 days a week like you are, unless you mean you each own separate businesses. You definitely aren't at fault in any way.", "No, your wife\u2019s diet and weight are merely the consequences of her own choices. NTA.", "NTA, it sounds like she\u2019s insecure about her fitness in comparison to yours. I can sympathize with her because I hate feeling pressured to eat healthy, but it\u2019s not at all your fault. She needs to think about why she feels the way she does and not aim her frustration at you.", "NTA, but this is not a you issue, this is a her issue.  If she wants to or not she NEEDS therapy.  She is projecting, and punishing her insecurities onto you.  She is hurting herself more than anyone because she is refusing to help herself.  Problem is SHE needs to see that the problem isn't you, it's her emotional, and mental state at the moment.  \n\nJust a suggestion, have you considered setting up some gym equipment some where in your house to use instead of going to the gym?  Maybe her problem going to the gym is that she is self concious, and embarrassed because she isn't at the same fitness level as others there.  If you can set up a home gym, and help her set up a low intensity routine, and go up slowly as she progresses will help.  IF this is something you can do, and she is willing to try it, do NOT work out with her because she will compare her abilities, and fitness level to yours.", "NTA - Not eating a meal with your spouse because they eat healthy? This sounds absurd. This is her avoiding something(s). Her illogical reasons as to why she gained weight is mind boggling. She is not taking responsibility for her actions or what she wants in life. Every topic she addresses stems to blaming you.  If you support these statements it validates her perception which often leads repeated behavior.\n\nYou call it 'your own life' but I suggest you view this as,  you have a structured life that includes her in many ways. You have couple and personal goals: work, health, travel. This is a healthy approach.\n\nThere seems to be a lot going on with her internal self (negative self talk, self sabotage). Is she open to going to counseling individual and couple?  We can all improve communication, clarify expectations, explore ways to grow closer etc,  when in relationships; especially long term ones.  I suspect this behavior evolved over time.   \n Check out internal locus of control (LOC): The degree to which people believe that they, as opposed to external forces, have control over the outcome of events in their lives. Her LOC seems low.  Best to you.", "NTA, does she take any responsibility for anything else in life??? She sounds like the blame game type\u2026 go to couples therapy, she\u2019ll be called out real quick and if she can\u2019t take it, you know what kind of person you\u2019re dealing with (not that therapists call people out, more shedding light on a situation or many situations) good luck!!!", "You\u2019re NTA. I have no desire to arm chair diagnose but your wife sounds like she has depression, self-esteem issues, and self-sabotage tendencies. She is choosing what to eat and what activities to do or not to do. That\u2019s not on you. She is projecting and blaming instead of taking responsibility for her own life and actions. \n\nShe needs to see a counselor about her issues with food as well, as it sounds like she may have a food addiction. Again, don\u2019t want to throw out diagnoses from a simple post but baking a cake and eating half of it (even if it was pretty flat) is not healthy, nor does it show a healthy relationship with food. \n\nI hope you\u2019re able to communicate and she\u2019s willing to listen so that you can work through this together.", ">She is also saying that I am at fault for her gaining a lot of weight in the last months (no complains about that, she is so beautiful), since me eating diet food forced her to order fast food every evening because she doesn't know how to cook only one portion.\n\nSo clearly she's having issues with her relationship with food and placing blame on you. Because misery loves company. All of those excuses are BS and designed to make you feel bad.", "NAH\n\nYour wife is trying to tell you she feels separated from you. You have a whole entire daily lifestyle she\u2019s not a part of, that feels at odds with her own. \n\nYou are trying to align what you can and engage with your wife in different ways but that apparently isn\u2019t enough. \n\nNeither of you is an asshole, but you may be reaching incompatibility.", "NAH - \n\nI agree with many of the other posters. There is nothing wrong with having your own schedule and doing things you enjoy. Bonus points that those things are healthy!  \n\nInsecurity could be a factor and I think you're doing a good job of offering suggestions/compromises without being hurtful or having any expectations of your wife. At the end of the day, she's her own person and only she can decide to change her behaviors. Likewise it's not your fault she has these behaviors and she can't blame them on you. \n\nKeep being supportive but keep enjoying the things that make you happy! -virtual hugs-", "Your an Ah for not making an effort in your marriage.\n\nTime is a love language and it seems like you completely ignore her and do your own thing and live your own life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also think that there is a lot of body insecurity involved. Just today she was telling me about how sad she is that none of her clothes fit her anymore.

Has she been super stressed out? And yeah, don't offer to help people lose weight - it makes them think you think they're fat. Especially if this is your s/o lol\n\nI don't know enough about y'all's relationship to really help, but I do think a heart to heart is going to be the best. There's probably a lot she's dealing with that you don't know about. She may want to be a \"normal couple\", but it's also normal to not eat with your partner every day. She needs to be willing to meet you in the middle of what she wants.\n\nI hope things get better between you two.

When I say evening I mean from 5pm or 6pm until we go to bed. As I said, the other 2-3 evenings during the week I go to the gym. During the days I have to work because we have to eat and pay for our house. I do take 1-2 breaks every day and when she is home I gladly spend those having coffee or a chat with her.\n\nDon't you think that she should make an effort to connect with me as well? By coming to gym with me? Or accepting to have dinners together, just with different foods?", "Oh, okay then.

I started with a therapist first honestly because I knew they couldn't prescribe me anything. Just like the gym the hardest part is starting and showing up. I would maybe encourage her to try telehealth therapy. I found it much more comfortable to be in my own house, (comfy in my sweats with my dog) and the control of if I absolutely hate this I can close the laptop and never have to talk to them again.", "That\u2019s a good solution, asking her to partake might be what she\u2019s waiting for.
