All our lives growing up, my sister has had severe allergies. A few sort of got phased out but others got much worse with exposure... namely her allergy to dog dander. A lot of people don't know about this but severe allergies to the point of anaphylaxis can actually happen with dog dander and is more common than you'd think. Unfortunately my sister is one of those people and is always hypervigillant in public as a result. It makes her life very difficult \n\n\nAnyway, growing up we were never close. I moved out immediately at 18 from a toxic, oppressive religious household and we only really kept in touch via Facebook every couple of months. Well, recently I get a text from her in which she explains she came home to her boyfriend telling her to pack her bags. She says how she has nowhere else to go and will basically be forced to sleep in her car if I don't let her stay with us. I'm sympathetic and offer to help her look for a new apartment, but explain we have a dog so it wouldn't be safe for her \n\nSo my sister seems to think I'm joking because she asks if I'm serious and if we can't just have the dog stay somewhere else for a few weeks while she gets back on her feet and says she will reimburse us for the cost of the stay and a cleaning of the house once she has the funds. I explain how that isn't possible because our pup has separation anxiety as she is adopted and she starts crying (at this point she's called and is making her case over the phone) saying she feels unsafe sleeping in her car and that I'm putting an animal over family and hangs up\n\nIt's been a few days since then and I still feel really bad... aita here? I understand she's in a bad spot but what she's asking feels impossible. It would eliminate all the progress our pup has made with her trauma from being rescued from a puppy mill and we can't really afford to house her elsewhere indefinitely anyway \n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1667617656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymiirt/aita_for_not_rehoming_my_dog_due_to_my_sisters/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she really has severe allergies, she should 100% be on allergy shots. If no allergy shots, then why not Claritin or nasal sprays??", "NTA. Even with a professional deep clean the odds are that there would still be dander and allergens that could potentially put your sister in the hospital. \nAnd then also it's your dog's home too. Does your sis not have any friends?", "Not only would you have to rehome your pup for an unknown period of time, you'd also have to seriously deep clean the place before should could even enter the premises.\n\nNTA. I wish her luck however.", "Your house has been your dog\u2019s home way before she ended up having to move out of her own.\n\nTell her to find another place to stay for her own health issues. Do NOT rehome your dog for her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA Your dog is your love and responsibility and you can not push it aside for her. If she can afford to pay for your dog to stay somewhere and professionally clean your house, she can afford to rent a room or motel for a couple of weeks to get on her feet. Also, in my house, there is no amount of cleaning that will eliminate all evidence of my dog or her dander. She is engrained in our floors, furniture, etc. \n\nI'm assuming you are the cheapest, most convenient choice she has found for couch crashing. She can call another relative, friend, or airbnb. \n\nIf you have not seen her in person for nearly 4 years, I also suspect she has an ulterior motive. You may find yourself unable to evict her after a month or so.", "Nta", "I\u2019m going to say NAH, but I can see both sides on this. I also am extremely (history of anaphylactic reactions) allergic to cat and dog dander. Everyone in my immediate family and close friends knows this. To the point my friends lint roll their clothing before stepping into my home. \n\nHaving been on this side of things my entire life, when my own sister got her first dog, it definitely felt like she was choosing a pet over me. Right or wrong, that\u2019s how it felt. I can\u2019t imagine going through what your sister is going through, and feeling that way on top of things. \n\nBut you don\u2019t have a responsibility to house your sister. Her situation sucks, and it\u2019s great that you offered to help in another way. \n\nTBH, even cleaning might not have been enough to avoid a strong allergic reaction. Most studies show that it takes about six months for dander to be fully cleaned out of a space, with regular cleaning, as the particles are so small. You\u2019d have to have the HVAC system fully and professionally cleaned. Replaced all of the couch and bedding pillows (washing doesn\u2019t get out all of the dander that works it\u2019s way in over time). Have the carpets deep cleaned (again, professionally, not a regular cleaning job). And even then, it still might not be enough, depending on how much of your furniture is fabric. If your dog was allowed on the bed, it would need to be a new mattress to ensure no reaction. \n\nYour sister is understandably emotional, and gosh it hurts feeling like an animal is picked over you. But it\u2019s not your fault, and it\u2019s not her fault. \n\nI say NAH instead of NTA because she should recognize you\u2019re still offering to help, just not in the way she would prefer and has decided is best. Your title is a bit misleading; it sounds like she\u2019s asking you to have your dog temporarily relocated, not rehomed.", "This is tough for all. NTA, but maybe still help her apartment hunt like you offered?", "Honestly as much as I want to say N T A I think this situation is NAH. I don't think she's an asshole for expecting you to put her, your sister, over your dog. But I also don't fault you for not doing that, you are not required to upend your life to help anyone.\n\nPlus she was with someone who would just kick her to the curb and doesn't have any savings or backup plan so it doesn't sound like she's made the best decisions in her life.", "NTA.", "NTA. If she can afford kennel costs and cleaning costs then she can afford a hotel.", "NTA I'd like you to replace \"sister\" with \"childhood friend you have limited contact with\" and then see how you feel about the situation.\n\nThe problem here isn't the dog. Even if you had a well adjusted dog used to boarding or overnights with friends while you traveled you still wouldn't be T A H. Even if you could conceivably clean your house well enough for her (which I highly doubt if her allergies are as bad as you said) she isn't asking to stay a weekend she's asking to stay an arbitrary amount of time. It also sounds like she doesn't have money to afford a hotel so how will she afford the dog boarding and cleaning fee?\n\nIf you let her stay I can see her immediately wanting to extend her visit and you'll have to let her... Because she's family. Later I could see her continually delay paying back the pet fees, she's good for it though, trust her because she's family. See where I'm going with this? Telling her no will likely put a strain on your relationship but personally, I always choose the pet.", "NTA. If your sister is that allergic to dog the cost of an allergy deep clean is huge. Plus furniture like couches, mattresses, chairs (the ones that are fabric covered or have built in cushions) etc will be almost impossible to clean sufficiently if the dog has been allowed up on the furniture adding to the additional outlay of new mattress, new couches etc. The fact she doesn\u2019t have the funds means that\u2019s an outlay would be required by you, and frankly you only have her word that she would pay you back. Honestly it would be cheaper to put her up in a cheap motel for a few weeks (if you are booking long term you can usually get a discount) than spending $2000+ on a deep allergen clean of your house plus the costs of temporarily rehoming your dog indefinitely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If I was in your situation, I'd never send my dog out the home, and I think you made the right choice. \n\nYour sister isn't entited to anything, but you could help her out with finding alternative accommodation. She might also be able to go to the doctor and get some medication for a few weeks (if that's safe to do), and you could try keep the dog out of a specific bedroom during that time.", "NTA, your sister cant ask of something like that, your pup im sure is like a child to you as you have share affection and many memories maybe even happier than what you had with your sister, don\u2019t feel obligated just because shes in a tough situation, it might sound harsh but im sure both you and the pup help each other get through difficult times something that your sister didn\u2019t care until she needed someone to help.", "NAH but, honestly, you get to choose between your sister being traumatized and the dog being traumatized. When I had a similar situation with a friend, I found another friend who was going out of the states for a few weeks and this way, she got a free housesitter and the one needing housing got a safe spot to stay while looking for a new spot. I hope you can find something similar but it's a case of damned if you do, damned if you don't for you, the dog, and your sister. At the very least...can you boyfriend take the dog and stay with a friend for a week???", "NTA What is going to change in a few weeks? Anyone I have known who was homeless would need months to recover, and that is if they were able to save all their wages. This few weeks may turn into several months. Does she have a full time job currently? There may be homeless shelters she could go to temporarily. You might help her to find a room to rent until she can get her own apartment. Is she totally broke or does she need financial help to even rent a room? Google housing assistance, homeless shelters etc. Good Luck.", "Info : did she specify why the reason for the breakup?", "NTA, as there\u2019s no way you could clean well enough for her anyway.  She\u2019s responsible for herself.", "NTA. Surely she has other friends or relatives she could ask or she could go to a shelter.\n\nYour dog is part of your family. And it\u2019s no small cost to board a doggo. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that she doesn\u2019t have the means to get herself a place or even a hotel room while she looks but she is not your responsibility.", "NTA \n\n* if she has life threatening allergies, there is no amount of cleaning your home that will protect her.  There's no way on the level of notice she gave you.\n* She hasn't made any effort to become closer to you over the years and now wants you to remove your dog from your house while she stays with you for a few weeks??", "NTA. It always shocks me when someone expects others to just \"rehome\" their furry family members to accommodate their needs. Tell her she's welcome to park her car in your driveway/yard and sleep in it there if that makes her feel safer but the pup will no be displaced from their home. Good luck!", "NTA.\n\nFor people who truly love their pets, they are a family member, like a child.\n\nI think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect you to dump a cherished family member, to accommodate her - especially because she has obviously made poor choices that lead to this.\n\nWhy can\u2019t she take an allergy medication?", "That's the thing, she CAN'T afford that. She's offering to pay for it later once she can, so maybe never at all in reality", "Post-panini, there are plenty of possible reasons other than bad decision making :(", "That isn't going to help. With an allergy that severe, the entire house, including heating vents etc, would have to be professionally deep cleaned at least once. It would probably be cheaper to put sis up in a no pets allowed hotel for a week.", "Defo NYA. Your helping her out, her life is changing not yours. Like you say she's paying later so if she doesn't pay not only will you have had extra costs (food bills) because she's been staying with you, you will also have the dog boarding fees Nd cleaning charges. Your offering to help if she accepts fine if not your life shouldn't have to change because hers has.. plus I'd miss my puppy too much if he wasn't with me", "all the more reason to maintain even a small slice of suspicion. for not being close growing up, and only being in touch online the last few years, it's worth asking why you would be an option here. and why does she feel so entitled? there's a chance \"later\" may never come. i agree that there's a whiff of something wonky here. NTA, and extra credit if you can help her problem solve effectively."]}
