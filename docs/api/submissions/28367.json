When I answered, she yelled at told me I scarred her kids for life and said that I was out of line with her kids and that I was never allowed to speak to them again. I told her that if I couldn\u2019t speak to her kids  or her when they were being loud at 5 am, I\u2019d just call the cops. She said that she couldn\u2019t control when her kids woke up and that she shouldn\u2019t be punished for it.

Out of sight out of mind.\nEdit:spelling", "NTA- Even in the 80s when dinosaurs ruled the earth and there were only four channels on my TV, two of them had super early programming for kids. One, clearly named by a commissioning editor with kids under 10, was called the 'Wide Awake Club' (in retrospect you can hear the gritted teeth) and was presented with all the manic energy of a desperate parent trying to provide other parents exhausted from a week where ironically the last thing the little buggers would do was get out of bed and get ready for school with a few hours more sleep. Despite being child free I have been that bouncy little bugger and I consider the Dawn Chaos to be a known phenomenon it is possible to find a work around for. If they'd been sat in front of the telly like they're meant to be at that time on a Saturday some cartoon would probably be telling them the same story you did.", "If her kids are up at 5 am and outside screaming blue murder, it's probably bc mom wanted to sleep herself and sent them outside so she could. \n\nShe's the adult (supposedly).

I told my kids, I didn't want them to call for help and it be fake.", "NTA\nShe literally can control when her kids wake up and how they act by being a good parent. It\u2019s very anti social of her and completely unreasonable behaviour on her party. She should be glad you shut them up for a bit.", "NTA. Dude 5am? They're lucky ur chill and didn't call 12 honestly. Regardless how scary the story is the whole point is to educate children to keep them safe, the kid would've heard the story in school, in a book, a TV show, a movie, etc. I live near a school and sometimes have to take a second to make sure a kid screaming is a normal kid being a kid and not a kid got hit by one of the jackasses who take 15 at 45.", "NTA  \nIf they were honestly frightened maybe the noise will stop but if not call the cops every time they wake you up. You sound way too passive. This behavior is unacceptable, even if it's \"just\" once a week!", "No worries there, our whole outside property is covered!", "Yeah in most areas there are residential noise regulations that have you keep it down after and before certain hours. I'm pretty sure 5am falls within those quiet times.", "I think that next time OP is woken up by the feral children should be the opportunity to hammer on their parent's door as heavily as that mother did to them.", "That\u2019s the thing. I didn\u2019t even tell the story. Just that if they scream all the time that people will ignore their screaming.", "me too!!!", "Unfortunately, that would deter the kids that I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m in a poorer neighborhood and I don\u2019t want to deter a kid from asking me for a granola bar or something.", "Which is a true and important safety lesson! There's a reason that story has been passed down for centuries. \n\nThe kids are right to fear being ignored if they're ever in genuine need of help, so maybe you could try doing the opposite? Treat every scream like it could actually be a real emergency and see how quickly your neighbours get tired of being 'rescued.' \n\nComplaints about the distress noises might be taken more seriously if they're phrased to express concern about the children's safety. You have no way of knowing these kids _aren't_ in danger - all you know is that they're screaming. I'd be surprised if any parent would say \"If my children are ever attacked or kidnapped, I want you to let it happen and don't report it.\" If next door wants you to stop acting like they're in urgent need of help, they have to teach their kids to stop acting like it.", "I can see that, you seem very considerate.       \nDo it in the mornings only when the kids are being loud, they're disturbing the peace anyway, right? They'll get the message.", "Not a terrible idea actually.", "Just be careful the sounds don't mess with anyone else around. I have sensory issues and even in my 30s I can *still* hear those damn noises lol. (My parents have a pigeon-botherer that humans aren't supposed to be able to hear. I CAN HEAR IT.) But also, since very high sounds are at very short frequencies, they don't tend to travel far at all, so you can target them pretty precisely.", "Yeah boiii, screw those kids lol", "Please be careful with those. I'm deaf in one ear and those are agony for me. Also if there are any children on the autism spectrum near you those can trigger a melt down. Also dogs hate them and won't stay outside when there is one on."]}
