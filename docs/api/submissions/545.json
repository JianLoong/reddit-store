It would make you a walking pariah and that... Gets lonely... I'd just ghost them, if they invite you to hangout again just ignore it 10/10 not worth the drama. Find a different group who won't leave you stranded with no notice.", "ESH If you lash out at them. It is not gonna accomplish anything in the long run. Take the high road an if you have to just tell them that you were disappointed that they just couldn't tell you so you can make other plans to get home.", "YWBTA\n\n\u201dGoing off on him\u201d accomplishes nothing but making you look a little unstable.\n\nText him back and say it was a huge inconvenience because it made you miss the bus and your parents had to drive an hour to get you", "YWBTA. Pick your battles; even if you're 100% in the right, you are not winning this one.", "Honestly, why give him the time of day? You know what he's all about because he showed you his true colors. Move on and get better friends.", "Keep your cool. Don\u2019t confront them. They did it on purpose. They are NOT your friends.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t even bother going off on him though, just don\u2019t be friends with him anymore. He sounds unworthy of ongoing friendship.", "ESH maybe it was a genuine mistake. Most kids don't live an hour away so they wouldn't have thought it was such a huge inconvenience. Lashing out not only alienates you but also potentially kills a budding friendship.", "I think your better option is to calm down, and when you speak to them be mature about it. You could say something like \u201cI looked forward to hanging out with you all. Next time if things fall through, let me know early enough that I won\u2019t miss my bus. My parents had to come get me, and we live about an hour away.\u201d", "YWBTA for going off on him at all. It was a jerk move of him, yes, and I get why you're angry. But take the chip off your shoulder and just let it go, man. It's not worth the hassle, and you could get in trouble if the school thinks you 'pick a fight' with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited: Typo", "Dude, take the high road. Act like it didn\u2019t even phase you. Keep your cool. It\u2019ll make you come out on top, and it\u2019ll also leave some of these new fragile acquaintanceships open if you decide to reengage later down the road.", "YWBTA for going off on him, but not for being angry.  It will serve you better to keep your cool.  Take a wait and see approach.  The driver\u2019s texted apology was at least an acknowledgment of his dickwad move.  \n\nIf you do talk to the group, I suggest you say that you need time to think about his apology.  Time will tell if being ditching you was an isolated incident, or if that was an typical example of the way he and his friends treat their classmates.  Hazing and \u201cpranking\u201d the new kid can spiral out of control, so being cautious is a good idea.  \n\nObserve how this group of students treat the classmates who have the least social status, and that will reveal who the bullies and A Hs are.  Don\u2019t lump the whole group of them together since one high school click can include both nice kids and jerks.\n\nGood luck in your new school.  A lot of your classmates will be watching to see what kind of person you are, so try to let this incident roll off.", "YWBTA or at least look like one to anyone outside of the situation. It\u2019s honestly not worth it. Do their actions suck? Yes. We\u2019re they jerks? Yes. Does it make sense that your feelings are hurt? Sure does. However, you going off will temporarily make you feel better while not changing their behavior at all. It would also likely make you look like a jerk to the other 95% of the schools population that didn\u2019t witness the incident. Take it as a learning experience about the type of people they are and move on.", "YWBTAH if you confront them. Just take the hint and NEVER engage again \n\nThey showed you what they thought of you. Believe them and move on", "It would be understandable, but it's not worth it.  They already scored off you once, don't give them any further satisfaction. Not to mention you could end up getting into trouble and that would only make things worse. Better to just ignore them and seek buddies who aren't toxic little snots.  High school sucks--that's why so many of us refuse to go to our reunions--but once you get out, the world opens up.  There is light at the end of the tunnel, I promise.  I won't say you would be the AH, but it wouldn't be smart.", "YWNBTA, but doing so would negatively impact the impression you make at your new school. Yes, that was an immature, AH move, but teenagers tend to act like AHs when they realize they've screwed up. (It doesn't make sense, but that's generally what the response is).\n\nA better bet is to be cool and make one, maybe two, joking remarks about it and then drop it.", "YWNBTA\n\nThere's no real point in going off on them though.   It was a prank.   They waited until you came out to leave.\n\nGoing off on them just adds to their joy.   Just remove them from your life.", "NTA it was a bs move but be the bigger person.  Just text him calling an AH and explain the distance you went out of your way for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lashing out is rarely a good idea, so I\u2019d suggest confronting him in a more civilized manner, saying something like \u201cit would have been nice if you told me sooner there was no room in the car so I could catch the bus home.\u201d You have every right to be angry with him but there are better ways to resolve conflict than by lashing out.", "What was your plan for after the mall? Were you going to make this guy drive you an hour home? Or were your parents going to have to pick you up anyway?", "they\u2019re a bunch of snobby rich kids, they don\u2019t care, even if they apologized in 99% sure it was done on purpose", "The  why did you want to hang out with them in the first place? You are right to be upset but it sounds like you don\u2019t know how to resolve conflicts without getting in someone\u2019s face which will not do well for you later in life. Public school would have taught you that", "I mean, if you want to be TA and burn bridges, go off I guess. But at some point soon you\u2019re going to need to learn how to be mature and let shit go. You can\u2019t live the rest of your life being an asshole without expecting negative consequences. You\u2019ve still got several months left of the school year. You get to decide right now whether it\u2019s going to be a shitty year or not.", "Just ignore them then. There is no value in going off on them. It will give them more satisfaction. They should no longer exist to you."]}
