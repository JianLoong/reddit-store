I was not part of the wedding, just a guest which I was fine with. Before the wedding, everyone was advised to drink lots of water and eat beforehand because it was going to be extremely hot that day.  The wedding started at 5:00pm, and I had absolutely nothing to eat or drink up until then except maybe a granola bar because I was extremely busy that day. So when it was time for the wedding, I was already tired and hungry. About thirty minutes into the wedding, (which was at a church btw), I was feeling uneasy and lightheaded so I excused myself to go to the washroom. As I was walking, I got that feeling like I was about to collapse. The next thing I can remember was coming to and see lots of people surrounding me including the bride and groom. Apparently, when I fainted, I fell onto the photographer who was crouched down near me. Not only that, but he dropped the camera lens down and it broke. Tbh I don\u2019t even remember seeing the photographer but I may have been too dizzy or something to have seen him. The wedding was a bit of a cheaper one, so the photographer was a family friend of the grooms who only had one camera with him. The bride was just in tears that she won\u2019t have any good pictures from her wedding. The photographer insisted that he could drive home and grab a different one, but it would take too long. The bride was indeed mad at me, but I feel it was a bit harsh as it was extremely embarrassing for me already. Fainting never even crossed my mind as something that would happen at all. They did get pictures but they were on cellphones.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693159456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162xeb0/aita_for_fainting_at_my_aunts_wedding_and_ruining/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "YTA\n\nNot for the fainting, that cannot be controlled, but for not drinking and eating despite being advised to - that CAN be controlled. You are not a little kid, I don't care how busy you were - unless you were running from an erupting volcano, you should have stopped to eat and drink, especially on a hot day.\n\nThis time, you ruined a wedding. Next time, you might endanger yours and someone else's life, depending on the place. Suddenly losing consciousness is not a joke. \n\nApologize, and don't do that again.", "I mean, kinda YTA, sorry - obviously you didn't mean to faint, that wasn't in your control, but by your own admission you didn't eat or drink all day even though you knew it was going to be very hot and you'd been advised to take precautions. And you don't seem to feel particularly bad about breaking the photographer's camera lens when you fell, because it was a \"cheaper\" wedding? It's a very soft YTA since none of this was intentional, but it sounds like you were negligent and then not particularly concerned about the consequences for other people.", "I would say a soft YTA. You obviously didn\u2019t mean any harm or meant to do these things but you also chose to ignore their requests to avoid this very thing from happening. Not getting to have real photos for your wedding day is a big deal. If I were you, I would apologize profusely and not diminish their valid anger in the situation. It sucks but this one\u2019s on you.", "YTA. You were warned that you should eat and drink before the wedding.  Why? Because things like fainting and heat exhaustion are real.  You ignored the advice.  You fainted as a result. You could\u2019ve gotten a pass if you hadn\u2019t fallen on the photographer, but you did.  Because of your choices, the bride does not have the wedding photographs she wanted.  She has every right to be really angry at you as your actions lead to that consequence.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you didn\u2019t intend for it to happen.  What matters is that you ignored their advice and the bride suffered as a result.", "Soft YTA You chose to attend the wedding already tired and hungry after choosing not to eat/drink all day even though you were warned beforehand. While you didn't faint on purpose, your choices significantly increased the likelihood of it happening and you messed up their wedding as a result.", "YTA as an adult you should have known better not to hydrate, and you were warned, but chose to ignore it. no one is too busy to drink fucking water ffs. take some responsibility for your health.", "YTA. If you had followed advice and then fainted it would be opposite but you didn\u2019t follow advice.  The resulting fact that you took out the photographer and camera were not down to you - it was circumstantial - but I can see why the bride was upset. All you had to do was drink water and you didn\u2019t and if I had no professional photos cos someone hadn\u2019t followed advice I would be upset too.", "YTA because this was preventable. You were advised to eat and drink and you didn\u2019t. You broke someone\u2019s expensive camera because you didn\u2019t listen. You ruined a wedding by causing a commotion because you didn\u2019t listen. The bride doesn\u2019t get professional photos because of you.", "Soft YTA, you are an adult and chose to ignore advice. It doesn't take long to eat a slice of bread and drink some water.\n\nYou did not faint on purpose of course however you did behave negligently to your health and then are unconcerned by the damage caused to someone else's property and that there won't be professional photographs from the wedding. You do suck a bit for that attitude.", "YTA, while fainting wasn\u2019t intentional you knew to eat and drink before hand and didn\u2019t. i hope you apologize and pay for the lens.", "YTA. How busy are you really that on the day that you know you\u2019re going to a wedding where you are not in the wedding party or involved in any way other than showing up, you are so \u2018extremely busy\u2019 you can\u2019t possibly have time to eat or drink anything? The people whose wedding it was even reminded you to hydrate. At no point in your day did you really not have a moment to grab a drink or a sandwich or something?\n\nPlus, how important are you that on a day you know is going to be hot, you are so hectically busy and have so many vitally important jobs to do that you absolutely cannot find time to at least get a drink? If you are so crazy busy, I\u2019m amazed you managed to even find time to attend the wedding at all!!!!", "YTA. Drinking a bottle of water and eating a sandwich takes 5 minutes. I refuse to believe you were that busy all day that you couldn\u2019t stop for 5 minutes. As a result you risked your health, broke a camera and ruined a wedding \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "YTA c'mon you're 21 and you don't know how to stay alive during a heat wave?", "How busy could you really be? Like really. Can\u2019t drink a glass of water? YTA", "You FAFO. YTA.", "YTA They said ahead of time to eat and drink because of the heat. Almost seems planned to garner as much attention as you could at this 'cheap' wedding.", "Sorry but YTA. You were told to make sure you had plenty to eat and drink... and you decided to not eat or drink anything.", "YTA\u2026\u2026If you had time to eat a granola bar then you had time to eat a sandwich or something else quick. You knew the conditions would be brutal and you still chose not to. Eat or drink anything. So yeah you stole the attention from them on probably the most important day of those people\u2019s lives.", "YTA They said ahead of time to eat and drink because of the heat. Almost seems planned to garner as much attention as you could at this 'cheap' wedding.", "YTA. As everyone already said, you did not take the proper precautions which were advised. Even though you cannot control fainting, due to your negligence, the wedding ended up being about you on maybe the most important day in this couple's lives. Lastly, lenses are about $1k, the situation all around sucks.", "What kind of photographer brings one camera to a wedding? Also, everyone there probably had a cell phone camera they could use. Put it portrait mode and start snapping.", "Very Emily in Paris, YTA sorry", "Attention seeker you are\ud83d\ude44", "I\u2019m about to be the asshole here. But I find it hard to believe you drank absolutely nothing, as you stated in your story, prior to 5pm. Busy or not, that doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nI\u2019m kind of getting the vibe that you didn\u2019t really faint\u2026 \n\nI went to a wedding where the bride\u2019s little sister did this. She \u201cfaked\u201d a fainting spell that went away real quick when most people ignored her (things like this were normal for the little sister). She pouted the rest of the wedding because no one would stop the wedding for her.\n\nEdit: I forgot to vote. YTA.", "YTA\nI would offer a photo shoot for the bride and groom as an apology so they can get some additional photos in their wedding clothes.", "NTA idk why everyone is saying you are. I've worked shifts in the sun without eating or drinking and have had no issues, so if you've never fainted before then this would've been unexpected. But now you've learned to keep hydrated and eat throughout the day, this was just an unfortunate accident.", "I would say NAH but it was your fault, just not in the asshole territory. And you really need to take better care of yourself. Not for the sake of inconveniencing others but for yourself. This can really impact your health later on, even if for now you are fine. Eating is a top need. The only thing that is more important is drinking.", "NTA \n\nMaybe you should've followed the advice but there had been times where I didn't have time to eat, especially because getting ready before a wedding takes a lot of time and you kind of have to rush.\n\nYou clearly didn't mean to faint and fall onto the photographer. You even offered to pay ! \n\nIn my opinion documenting every moment isn't necessary and with phone's cameras nowadays they could've take plenty of good quality pictures until the photographer went and replaced his camera. \n\nI've been to a wedding where the best man fainted due to the heat ... twice and they had to pause the ceremony for a bit , it's just basic human decency imo.", "NTA. This was an accident. You didn't practice fainting or intentionally faint on purpose or anything. Accidents happen. Did it out a damper on the event? Yes. But it wasn't intentional and they can be disappointed but to be upset with you seems misplaced. \n\nThis would be entirely different if you got drunk and blacked out and this happened. But that isn't what happened here.", "YTA, and if you weren\u2019t in the wedding, how were you SO busy that you couldn\u2019t take 10 minutes to eat and drink?", "Obviously you\u2019re not the asshole, I feel like you know this though?", "It was an accident. They should have hired a professional if they wanted professional pictures. No decent or experienced photographer shows up to a wedding with just one ANYTHING.", "NTA. While, yes, it was irresponsible to yourself to not drink water on such a hot day, but there was no way to know that you were going to faint the moment that you did. It's a shame that it happened to be on top of the photographer, but there's nothing you can do about that now. Hopefully you learned the hard way why it's important to stay hydrated.", "It was an accident. They should have hired a professional if they wanted professional pictures. No decent or experienced photographer shows up to a wedding with just one ANYTHING.", "NTA. It's not like you fainted on purpose. But please do STAY HYDRATED!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, it\u2019s not difficult to just keep sipping water throughout the day whilst working and you MUST have something to eat.

I don't care HOW busy I am, I'm good for at least a gallon a day.  If I was told to hydrate and eat, I would MAKE SURE to do so.  It's not necessary to have a sit down meal to eat.  One granola bar?  Uh huh.  If you had those, maybe 3 or 4 along with at least 8 oz of water.   I carry a 24 Tervis container of water everywhere I go.  If I know I'm going to be away from home for a long period, I have a 64 bottle I take.    You had time to do makeup amd dress.
