I was not part of the wedding, just a guest which I was fine with. Before the wedding, everyone was advised to drink lots of water and eat beforehand because it was going to be extremely hot that day.  The wedding started at 5:00pm, and I had absolutely nothing to eat or drink up until then except maybe a granola bar because I was extremely busy that day. So when it was time for the wedding, I was already tired and hungry. About thirty minutes into the wedding, (which was at a church btw), I was feeling uneasy and lightheaded so I excused myself to go to the washroom. As I was walking, I got that feeling like I was about to collapse. The next thing I can remember was coming to and see lots of people surrounding me including the bride and groom. Apparently, when I fainted, I fell onto the photographer who was crouched down near me. Not only that, but he dropped the camera lens down and it broke. Tbh I don\u2019t even remember seeing the photographer but I may have been too dizzy or something to have seen him. The wedding was a bit of a cheaper one, so the photographer was a family friend of the grooms who only had one camera with him. The bride was just in tears that she won\u2019t have any good pictures from her wedding. The photographer insisted that he could drive home and grab a different one, but it would take too long. The bride was indeed mad at me, but I feel it was a bit harsh as it was extremely embarrassing for me already. Fainting never even crossed my mind as something that would happen at all. They did get pictures but they were on cellphones.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693159456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162xeb0/aita_for_fainting_at_my_aunts_wedding_and_ruining/", "score": 10839, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "YTA\n\nNot for the fainting, that cannot be controlled, but for not drinking and eating despite being advised to - that CAN be controlled. You are not a little kid, I don't care how busy you were - unless you were running from an erupting volcano, you should have stopped to eat and drink, especially on a hot day.\n\nThis time, you ruined a wedding. Next time, you might endanger yours and someone else's life, depending on the place. Suddenly losing consciousness is not a joke. \n\nApologize, and don't do that again.", "I mean, kinda YTA, sorry - obviously you didn't mean to faint, that wasn't in your control, but by your own admission you didn't eat or drink all day even though you knew it was going to be very hot and you'd been advised to take precautions. And you don't seem to feel particularly bad about breaking the photographer's camera lens when you fell, because it was a \"cheaper\" wedding? It's a very soft YTA since none of this was intentional, but it sounds like you were negligent and then not particularly concerned about the consequences for other people.\n\nedit: wow thanks for the upvotes! also from a serial fainter, a PSA: if you feel like you're getting dizzy/lightheaded, *do not* do what OP did and get up and try to walk. stay seated, lie down if you can, ask someone to bring you water.", "I would say a soft YTA. You obviously didn\u2019t mean any harm or meant to do these things but you also chose to ignore their requests to avoid this very thing from happening. Not getting to have real photos for your wedding day is a big deal. If I were you, I would apologize profusely and not diminish their valid anger in the situation. It sucks but this one\u2019s on you.", "YTA. You were warned that you should eat and drink before the wedding.  Why? Because things like fainting and heat exhaustion are real.  You ignored the advice.  You fainted as a result. You could\u2019ve gotten a pass if you hadn\u2019t fallen on the photographer, but you did.  Because of your choices, the bride does not have the wedding photographs she wanted.  She has every right to be really angry at you as your actions led to that consequence.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you didn\u2019t intend for it to happen.  What matters is that you ignored their advice and the bride suffered as a result.", "Soft YTA You chose to attend the wedding already tired and hungry after choosing not to eat/drink all day even though you were warned beforehand. While you didn't faint on purpose, your choices significantly increased the likelihood of it happening and you messed up their wedding as a result.", "YTA as an adult you should have known better not to hydrate, and you were warned, but chose to ignore it. no one is too busy to drink fucking water ffs. take some responsibility for your health.", "YTA. If you had followed advice and then fainted it would be opposite but you didn\u2019t follow advice.  The resulting fact that you took out the photographer and camera were not down to you - it was circumstantial - but I can see why the bride was upset. All you had to do was drink water and you didn\u2019t and if I had no professional photos cos someone hadn\u2019t followed advice I would be upset too.", "YTA because this was preventable. You were advised to eat and drink and you didn\u2019t. You broke someone\u2019s expensive camera because you didn\u2019t listen.

It doesn't take long to eat a slice of bread and drink some water.\n\nYou did not faint on purpose of course however you did behave negligently to your health and then are unconcerned by the damage caused to someone else's property and that there won't be professional photographs from the wedding. You do suck a bit for that attitude.", "YTA, while fainting wasn\u2019t intentional you knew to eat and drink before hand and didn\u2019t. i hope you apologize and pay for the lens.", "YTA. How busy are you really that on the day that you know you\u2019re going to a wedding where you are not in the wedding party or involved in any way other than showing up, you are so \u2018extremely busy\u2019 you can\u2019t possibly have time to eat or drink anything? The people whose wedding it was even reminded you to hydrate. At no point in your day did you really not have a moment to grab a drink or a sandwich or something?\n\nPlus, how important are you that on a day you know is going to be hot, you are so hectically busy and have so many vitally important jobs to do that you absolutely cannot find time to at least get a drink? If you are so crazy busy, I\u2019m amazed you managed to even find time to attend the wedding at all!!!!", "YTA. Drinking a bottle of water and eating a sandwich takes 5 minutes.

Almost seems planned to garner as much attention as you could at this 'cheap' wedding.", "YTA. As everyone already said, you did not take the proper precautions which were advised. Even though you cannot control fainting, due to your negligence, the wedding ended up being about you on maybe the most important day in this couple's lives. Lastly, lenses are about $1k, the situation all around sucks.", "What kind of photographer brings one camera to a wedding? Also, everyone there probably had a cell phone camera they could use.

But I find it hard to believe you drank absolutely nothing, as you stated in your story, prior to 5pm. Busy or not, that doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nI\u2019m kind of getting the vibe that you didn\u2019t really faint\u2026 \n\nI went to a wedding where the bride\u2019s little sister did this. She \u201cfaked\u201d a fainting spell that went away real quick when most people ignored her (things like this were normal for the little sister). She pouted the rest of the wedding because no one would stop the wedding for her.\n\nEdit: I forgot to vote. YTA.", "YTA\nI would offer a photo shoot for the bride and groom as an apology so they can get some additional photos in their wedding clothes.", "NTA idk why everyone is saying you are. I've worked shifts in the sun without eating or drinking and have had no issues, so if you've never fainted before then this would've been unexpected. But now you've learned to keep hydrated and eat throughout the day, this was just an unfortunate accident.", "I would say NAH but it was your fault, just not in the asshole territory. And you really need to take better care of yourself. Not for the sake of inconveniencing others but for yourself. This can really impact your health later on, even if for now you are fine. Eating is a top need. The only thing that is more important is drinking.", "NTA \n\nMaybe you should've followed the advice but there had been times where I didn't have time to eat, especially because getting ready before a wedding takes a lot of time and you kind of have to rush.\n\nYou clearly didn't mean to faint and fall onto the photographer. You even offered to pay ! \n\nIn my opinion documenting every moment isn't necessary and with phone's cameras nowadays they could've take plenty of good quality pictures until the photographer went and replaced his camera. \n\nI've been to a wedding where the best man fainted due to the heat ... twice and they had to pause the ceremony for a bit , it's just basic human decency imo.", "NTA. This was an accident. You didn't practice fainting or intentionally faint on purpose or anything. Accidents happen. Did it out a damper on the event? Yes. But it wasn't intentional and they can be disappointed but to be upset with you seems misplaced. \n\nThis would be entirely different if you got drunk and blacked out and this happened. But that isn't what happened here.", "YTA, and if you weren\u2019t in the wedding, how were you SO busy that you couldn\u2019t take 10 minutes to eat and drink?", "Obviously you\u2019re not the asshole, I feel like you know this though?", "It was an accident. They should have hired a professional if they wanted professional pictures. No decent or experienced photographer shows up to a wedding with just one ANYTHING.", "NTA. While, yes, it was irresponsible to yourself to not drink water on such a hot day, but there was no way to know that you were going to faint the moment that you did. It's a shame that it happened to be on top of the photographer, but there's nothing you can do about that now. Hopefully you learned the hard way why it's important to stay hydrated.", "It was an accident. They should have hired a professional if they wanted professional pictures.

Why would fainting not be something that crosses your mind especially when you were explicitly warned before the wedding to eat and stay hydrated because it was going to be hot? Not eating or drinking until late afternoon is a recipe for fainting anyway, add the heat and it\u2019s even worse. And how are you \u201ctoo busy\u201d to eat or drink anyway? Keep a water bottle near you and drink while you\u2019re doing whatever you\u2019re doing. Keep snacks that are easy to eat while you\u2019re doing whatever you\u2019re doing or take a 10 minute break to eat something (or eat in the car while you\u2019re driving).

You\u2019re young and I know a lot of people your age who forget to eat/hydrate, even when warned to do so - even when health issues require them to.

There are far worse things you could have done.", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA :(", "Yes you are the wedding wasn\u2019t cheap just budget friendly paying 6-7 thousand for pictures is a lot so friends are tons cheaper, you need to buy the photographer a new lens they are 3-6 hundred his maybe more you didn\u2019t take care of yourself that day and yes ruined the wedding!", " Please take better care of yourself. Being busy is no excuse for not staying hydrated in extreme heat.", "YTA. How can you go a whole day and not drink anything? I have water with me at all times!", "I read the title and thought no of course not, but reading this YTA.\n\nTo me it actually does sound like you did this on purpose. Warnings to eat and drink before a wedding are not typical. Most people know to drink more when it's extremely hot. What were you doing that you were too busy to drink? Unless it's a job that prevents it I don't really understand this. If you're running errands take a water bottle with you, if you forgot it pick one up.\n\nThen you're at the wedding in the middle of the ceremony and what do you do? Stand up, by yourself to walk to the bathroom by yourself. You feel like you're going to collapse and what do you do? Stay upright until you do faint. Why not sit down?\n\nThe comment about the wedding being cheaper just adds to the likelihood this was on purpose.\n\nMaybe you left something out that would explain what happened better for not eating and drinking.", "Soft YTA.

I have a medical condition that makes it so I can faint if I shift positions too quickly.\n\nThis was on you. You were told to eat and drink. It was 5 pm and you STILL hadn\u2019t.

Not only did you probably cost them money (the price of the lens at the very least) but you also prevented them from getting the photos they would have had from the rest of the night if the lens had not been broken. If it were me, I would apologize, contact the photographer, and offer to reimburse them directly for the lens. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to go back in time and get photos from their wedding day again. But I would also probe for some options to make it up to them -perhaps to pay a photographer to be present at their housewarming or maybe offer to fund a session at their venue in their wedding day attire if there were any specific shots they had hoped to get but weren\u2019t able to.\n\nIt\u2019s a bad situation and I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re a terrible person.

BIG TIME.   Your actions, or lack thereof, caused serious repercussions.  You ruined the wedding!

I understand not feeling like eating when it\u2019s that hot, but you could have had energy drinks, Gatorade, ice cream, a fruit bowl, a milkshake\u2026 something liquid with nutritional value and possibly some electrolytes, because heatstroke is a thing.

The consequences of my own actions!", "YTA. They told everyone to eat and drink and you chose not to take care of yourself.

You didn't pass out on purpose but it's still your fault. \n\n\n>The wedding was a bit of a cheaper one, \n\nThis has nothing to do with what you did.

The venue being \"cheaper\" doesn't mean the family friend didn't bring something nice because he cares about his friend.)\n\nAND OP is the AH for having little to no remorse that, intentionally or unintentionally, breaking/damaging someone else's property.\n\nAND (*insert animated Uncle meme here \"one MORE thing\"*) OP is the AH for not treating someone else's (and it's for her aunt, too!) wedding with more respect. If you have time to be busy and not eat then you have 30 seconds to sit in the back where you won't disturb anyone if you do faint.\n\nAND OP is the AH for trying to convince us everything is okay because she didn't mean to because she didn't think she would faint. At the very least realize there's a lesson to your experience!\n\nAND OP just the AH for not mentioning how she would apologize to her aunt (the bride)! Not everything is about you, OP. Even as someone who wishes sometimes I would faint so I'd have a reason to be tired and forgetful (it would indicate an ~~acceptable~~ medical reason) I would *never* simply neglect my health, faint at a wedding, and then proceed to be upset that someone is frustrated by the interruption! You didn't even *just* faint, you broke the lens of a professional camera and could have potentially injured the cameraman, not because of a legitimate health condition you couldn't control but because you neglected yourself and you neglected your aunt and you neglected the warning about needing to eat and drink so you don't faint from self-induced heat sickness. If you can't take care of yourself then it's very likely you won't be able to do a good job taking care of others, especially when your health fails.\n\nAND OP is the AH for neglecting her health in the first place. *Busy* doesn't matter. *Busy* can take a backseat. The more your health declines the sooner you'll fail to continue make good decisions. It snowballs and it only takes one moment.\n\nOkay I had to go back and count. OP is 7x the AH. 8 if we want to go on about what seems to be a self-centered approach she has to life.\n\nOP, you need a life change. Go take care of your health. Make a proper apology to the bride & groom (they're a unit now). And find some way to try to make amends for the broken lens, even if all you can (legitimately) afford is a genuine hand-written apology. And then go back and take care of your health again, that's a lifelong habit/chore that's necessary. If you don't prioritize food then perhaps you haven't found the right diet. Diet is more than \"here's something to enter my belly and be digested so I can continue my day\". I personally find that I have to enjoy my food or I'll neglect it as well. Let people hate me but I enjoy American Asian food, burritos, hamburgers, three milk cake, etc, a lot... I experiment with flavors and spices I like. There's a spiced vanilla tea that I don't particularly enjoy, however it was wonderful when I drank it while eating a ((hamburger cooked in sea salt butter) topped with kewpie mayonnaise). Judge me all you want but the combination was far better than just the same old classic hamburger (at least when it comes to my cooking). I did have to babysit the hamburger while it was cooking though. I also like the bibigo! brand chicken dumplings from Walmart dipped in Yum Yum Sauce. And I don't normally eat a chicken sandwich if I haven't *at least* toasted the whole wheat bread first (it gives it a nutty flavor) and add two controlled layers of normal mayonnaise (the first thin layer soaks into the warm toasted bread to slightly soften it, the second normal layer is for taste). Adding shreds of fresh rosemary or a smattering of fresh horseradish when I can afford it just makes it amazing, but adding tomato to any variation overpowers the other flavors of the sandwich. Just eat something delicious, okay, OP?", "first of all, how is someone *too busy* to drink water like I don't understand it's such a simple motion just twist and sip lol wtf. \n\n\nAs someone who doesn't faint, I always carry a water with me especially with how hot this summer has been, you're asking for trouble if you can't can't be bothered to bring something to hydrate with in this heat. \n\n& then she's nonchalant about breaking someone's personal belongings, and possible side hustle, just because it was \"cheap\", which unless it was a digital camera from the value store I doubt it was cheap, is just arrogant and rude.

My question is how did the photographer not notice? Usually before someone faints you can see them starting to fall , unless he was RIGHT next to her he may have had time to move. Not saying its hsi fault because its not but if i was there and saw someone was about to faint i would have tried to move and asked them if they were okay.

This is one of those sorts of accidents that everyone knows will happen, but people ignore it until it does.\n\nI'm assuming the church wasn't climate controlled if everyone was making such a big deal out of how hot the weather was. Everyone talking about fainting demonstrates that lots of people were aware that people faint and it's a relatively common occurrence at weddings. Even when people do eat and drink.\n\nHaving a wedding in the summer increases that risk, especially if the location isn't running AC.\n\nWedding photographs are a really big deal for some people. There is always a risk that the photographer will drop the ball in some way that results in not having pictures. A good photographer takes a bunch of precautions to avoid this scenario.\n\nThe risk of using a family friend with a nice camera is that there is an increased risk of not getting photos taken with a fancy camera.\n\nOP might not have the best attitude about the situation, but there isn't any indication it was done intentionally.\n\nHere is from a photography website:\n\n> What To Do If Your Camera Breaks at a Wedding\n\n> Step 1: Comfort whoever dropped the camera (if applicable). The last thing you want is to be the root of drama on a wedding day. Assure that person that it\u2019s okay. They aren\u2019t in trouble, and everything is going to be okay (even if it isn\u2019t).\n\n> Step 2: Assure the bride and groom that everything is okay. You have backup cameras and lenses. Above all, let them know they are still going to have the most amazing wedding photographs.\n\nNobody wants to say the photographer screwed up, but they did. That doesn't make them a bad person, but it's what you get when you don't use an experienced professional.\n\nNobody wants to blame whoever planned the wedding, because we all understand how expensive a wedding can be...but it's silly to ignore the reality of the situation. They made a series of choices such that a single mistake could 'ruin' their wedding. \n\nAnd then a mistake happens and everyone puts all the blame on a fairly trivial thing. OP could have done a better job of preparing, but there are a million reasons why someone might need to get up and walk away. She could have drank too much water, needed to use the restroom, and tripped over the photographer.\n\nPeople want to blame _someone_ when bad things happen..but on a big enough scale, it's obvious that something like this will happen.\n\n> Fainting spells make up about 3% of annual visits to the Emergency Room and 6% of hospital admissions. Fainting also happens to be a common occurrence at weddings.\n\nHave enough weddings and people are going to faint, no matter what precautions you take. And telling people 'Hey make sure you don't faint' isn't very effective, even if eating and drinking will help reduce the odds.\n\nHave enough weddings and the photographer's camera will break.\n\nThings go wrong. It's expected. We can do more prep to reduce the odds but they come with $$$.\n\nNobody is wrong here. It was a bunch of well intentioned people, trying to share a special day.", "NTA. I'm sure you've been busy before and not eaten. Who blames someone for fainting? If you sneezed is that allowed? Yikes with these responses about how you should have known.", "Nta these comments are wild lmao", "Things happen, and time can carry away too fast. I have worked for hours then it is 8 pm and i realized that I didn't eat lunch or dinner. \n\nIf she was talking care of all this stuff for her aunt and that happened NTA.", "Not TA weddings are BRUTAL.Sometimes you really don\u2019t have time to eat or drink,that\u2019s just a fact.It\u2019s unfortunate that all this happened,personally depending on my relation to who\u2019s getting married I wouldn\u2019t have gone if heat exhaustion/heat stroke could have been prevalent at the wedding.I do not do well in heat to begin with,regardless of if I eat or drink.OP could have been more proactive but that isn\u2019t always possible.It\u2019s just bad all around tbh", "NTA.

You and everyone knows, yes you probs should\u2019ve eaten and drank before hand. Not the best move.

What if it were to turn into the first of a series of episodes?\n\nWould people STILL be blaming her?\n\n**It no one else's business what medical issue might or might not have caused it - unless they're the ones liable for an unsafe environment that was the cause.**\n\nOP, you might not have made optimal decisions, but you're not an asshole for it.\n\nHowever, people upset at you for it might very well be.", "NTA.

No, you fainted because you didn't eat or drink, in the heat. This was entirely preventable. You were even warned to eat and be hydrated, which frankly is something no one should have needed to be told. Your lack of self-care and forethought had consequences to people besides yourself. For that, you are responsible.\n\nAlso, you owe the photographer a new lens. Think of it as a lesson learned.

My aunt tried to step away to the tables with food/drinks to get water for her mom (our Grandma) but was told by the ushers that everyone had to remain seating per \u201cBrides orders.\u201d She told him to get her mom a water then, and he refused; no food or drink during the ceremony per \u201cBride\u2019s orders.\u201d Because this wasn\u2019t \u201cthat kind of affair.\u201d  We all had words for my cousin and his new wife that day, and the only thing she\u2019d say was \u201cthat *was* the abbreviated ceremony, and we were standing the whole time and we were fine.\u201d", "I was a guest to my cousins wedding 2 years ago in the summer. It was over 90 degrees in a vineyard with no shade. Small wedding since it was during Covid (about 50 ppl, mainly family & primary friend group). I kept 2 granola bars & a pack of gum in my purse and held a water bottle in my hand. They had two ceremonies, so I would eat between that time. Heck I\u2019m sure I could\u2019ve went to the bathroom or around a corner to snack real quick then get back if I needed to.", "I have it too!! No surgery \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f my mother has it also. No surgery for her.\nI had my gallbladder removed but it had nothing to do with my diagnosis,I had a mass(tumor) so it needed to be removed.\n\nWe found mine due to me being 24, my grandpa died from gastro cancer(s)(it spread) and my other one found stomach cancer around my age\u2026..my mom started getting stomach issues after she had me at 21\u2026\u2026.so it needed to be done.\nAfter 2 solid weeks of throwing up,blood coming o  of both ends,loosing around 10lbs(I\u2019m under 90 naturally) not being able to eat/drink etc all the fun stuff-but no flu.\n\nFound the mass,it tripled in size so gallbladder was removed-still for the same issues though with it being gone \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think we found the bride", "I get he was ungrateful and overreacted but I would kinda be little annoyed too if I asked for chocolate and got that lol.", "OP needs to pay for the lens that was broken. I was a wedding photographer for 17 years. It was very irresponsible for the photographer to not bring any extra gear. So they're the AH as well. But OP is definitely the main AH!!!", "Most of my friends who are nurses, paramedics, docs... if we get invited to a 5pm wedding, we still work that day - esp if it's an aunt rather than a direct relative or best friend.  We work, we don't eat or drink - we're busy.  We finish an hour early, get changed & get out there to sit down just before the bride gets there.", "I have legitimately only heard women say they were \u201ctoo busy to eat or drink\u201d throughout the day.   My ex did this a lot until she finally told me that she had an eating disorder in HS and it was creeping back so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a thing with hidden eating disorders since they are a bit more prevalent with women. \n\nI have seriously never heard any of my guy friends say, \u201cbro I was so busy today I had no time to eat or even take a sip of water\u201d. I always make it a priority to have at a minimum breakfast and dinner. Sometimes I have had to skip lunch, and I always have a water bottle on me. Any time I have missed breakfast was because I woke up like 5 minutes before I\u2019ve had to leave to get somewhere, but then I\u2019ll make it a point to get lunch.", "That\u2019s what my grandma would say!", "NTA\nIf your wedding is on a extremely hot day, there is a chance someone is gonna pass out from heat exhaustion. It happens all the time regardless of what you do. \n\nBeing an asshole is an intentional thing, and I doubt OP intended to pass out and knock over the photographer. \nThe situation sucks, but blaming this women for passing out is ridiculous.", "NTA, fainting isn\u2019t your fault, that\u2019s a medical problem and people should be concerned about you not getting mad at you. You absolutely should eat and drink things, especially on hot days. but to be fair, if it\u2019s hot enough that they needed to warn you about it then it\u2019s just too hot, and thats bound to cause issues for people.\n\nRather than thinking about whether or not the fainting or not eating was an asshole thing to do, you should consider the fact that you disregarded your essential needs for the whole day either intentionally or you just forgot. I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve skipped meals and water, so I hope you can find a method that works for you in the future to make sure you eat enough! It\u2019s just not safe for you to do that, but the anger towards you is a bit unwarranted imo.", "NTA, they should be more worried about your health, pictures can be taken at any time", "Hello Yoda", "Yes, also people are acting like 21 is a fully fledged adult. I\u2019m 27 and still need to force myself to make time to eat some days because of my ADHD. Some people actually struggle to look after themselves due to mental health etc, we really don\u2019t know anything about OPs life.", "I agree op is TA, but they said, it was a cheap wedding, so they didn't have 2 photographers with 3 cameras and a drone. Just a family friend.", "From a family with low blood pressure. Not only is it asking for trouble, but when you start feeling lightheaded and you know you haven't eaten, you sit the fuck down.\n\nI have alarmed a few people by sitting down on the floor suddenly, but it was a heck of a lot less drama than the few times I didn't and fainted.", "In fact... what does it matter if the wedding was \"cheap\"? Maybe it's all they can afford, maybe they prefer to spend their money in other things. Who cares. Are they any less married than if they had a million-dollar wedding? OP soulds arrogant. \n\nAnd the photographer was probably an amateur, maybe they didn't have any other lenses - at least none appropriate for weddings. And now, thanks to OP, that lens is ruined.  And she isn't even sorry becasue \"she didn't see him\". The least she could do is to apologise to everyone involved, to replace the lens and to offer the married couple a professional photo session. But she's only worried about being embarrassed for something she could have easily avoided. \n\nOP, YTA. A giant one.", "Depends what you're eating. If I'm running late in the morning, I'll toss some dry cereal into a plastic bowl and eat it by the fistful while driving on straight, slower streets. It's easy to eat, it's not messy, I don't have to look. \n\nAnd if it spills, I just vacuum it up when I get home. \n\nAnything more complicated or that can be messy (like a burger) I'll just stuff my face before I start driving.", "I had a sugar daddy I once told I wanted to photograph birds to, so he got me this camera lens. WTF I LOOKED IT UP ITS 1500??!!!?? TO PHOTOGRAPH A BIRD?!\n\nBest part is it WAS perfect for getting birds - only I still sucked and never did get fancy photos of one.", "Not everyone who is an AH has ADHD/autism/anxiety.", "Because he wasn't a professional photographer and therefore he had no experience to know that he can't zone out and needs to maintain situational awareness beyond what he sees through the viewfinder. At the rate he was going, his camera body wouldn't have survived the reception because he'd be taken out by the electric slide.\n\nHaving heard of enough idiot amateurs shooting weddings that they shouldn't, the lens breaking is as much or more due to his own negligence than OP's.\n\nI'm a professional photographer. My camera or lens breaking will always be my fault unless a roof collapses on me or something extreme and then probably still my fault for going somewhere a roof might collapse. If someone falls into me, 100% my fault for not wrapping my body around the camera effectively to cushion it. You learn to treat it like a newborn infant. \n\nI've broken my fair share of lenses (2) over the last decade. Both times negligence on my part for not being aware while it was on a strap. I've literally had children run into me full tilt, take me clean off my feet and never broken a lens and child portraiture was my bread and butter for most of that decade.", "Yep, one of my lenses is $3200 and the other is $2800 lol, my camera body cost $5000. This doesn\u2019t event take into account my lighting, laptop, yearly payments to access adobe programs, Dropbox pro, other various bits and bobbles needed like very fast/expensive memory cards etc lol", "Plus she\u2019s not even embarrassed about the right thing. I\u2019d be so embarrassed I ruined things for being so thoughtless.", "Imo it's unfair to call her TA just because she didn't drink or eat. She said she was busy but she could have some underlying thing which makes it difficult to do basic things to look after yourself. Best example of this is with myself and my ADD, just today I completely forgot to eat or drink for the whole day because I was so distracted by some stuff. \n\nAnyway, she seems sorry about it all but I think if I was her I'd at least offer to pay for a new camera for the photographer.", "Wow first NTA in the top your 23rd from the top", "100% agree! Thank god for this. I think everyone is getting super caught up and pissed off about the wording OP used but like if you look at the facts, okay it could\u2019ve been prevented but hey so could most things in life. That\u2019s life, shit happens. Accidents happen. \n\nI think if someone is that pressed about getting many photos, you should be prepared (make sure your photographer has a backup camera in case of emergency). Obviously the photographer had one at home, sorry but should\u2019ve had the foresight to bring it.\n\nIt also sounds like the bride might\u2019ve let it ruin her day more than it needed to. 30mins in I\u2019m sure there are already 100s of photos of the ceremony. Everyone takes 5 so that everyone can make sure OP is okay, best man/maid of honour how about you go sort something out with the photographer. Maybe they can ask someone to pick it up from their house and drop off to them. If that\u2019s not feasible, someone can spend 5 mins making some calls to see if another last min photographer can join for the reception. (Send the invoice to OP if you feel necessary. Or just get them to cover the original guys fee including new lens.) WORST CASE as OP mentioned there were plenty of phone photos and we all know how high quality they turn out these days. \n\nYes annoying for people to have to do those things but tbh that\u2019s what the wedding party is for, to sort out any issues that happen on the day. They could\u2019ve spent 10-20 mins trying to resolve it, quick little break for everyone to stretch their legs. At that point if you haven\u2019t found a solution, say you know what fuck it we\u2019ve already got 30min worth of photos, we have phones to take more for the rest of the day, now let\u2019s get married and enjoy ourselves!!! \n\nChrist, imagine letting your day get ruined because you couldn\u2019t get photos. Better to enjoy it without photos than to let it be \u2018ruined\u2019 because you couldn\u2019t get as many photos as you wanted", "And the camera! She handwaves it because she doesn't remember seeing the photographer crouched on the ground beside her, and uses that as an excuse to disregard the damage that resulted from her spill, as if the damage wasn't her fault. Hell no, apologize and pay for that broken lens! Those are not cheap!", "Definitely lots of posts with \"should've\"s and \"could've\"s", "I have ADHD. That's no excuse. Op was warned way ahead of time, OP has shown absolutely no remorse whatsoever AND is throwing shade at the aunt.", "Canon 5D is a very popular camera body with amateur and pro photographers alike and they're around $1600 used or $2600 new, OP probably caused over $3000 in damage and the guy was too awkward about the situation (some woman just fell on him, injured him and broke his camera gear) to accept her offer of payment as she probably massively undervalued it in her head and he didn't want to get into a fight with her over the cost.", "\"Oh no I forgot to wash any of my 23 water bottles... again.\"", "I mean, the wedding was at 5 pm so that could be any number of things from studying to work to other commitments. Doesn't excuse it, but there are people who can do things before an event and don't have to sit anxiously at home before said event. (I'm generally in the latter category myself)"]}
