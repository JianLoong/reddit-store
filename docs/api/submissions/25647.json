I was not part of the wedding, just a guest which I was fine with. Before the wedding, everyone was advised to drink lots of water and eat beforehand because it was going to be extremely hot that day.  The wedding started at 5:00pm, and I had absolutely nothing to eat or drink up until then except maybe a granola bar because I was extremely busy that day. So when it was time for the wedding, I was already tired and hungry. About thirty minutes into the wedding, (which was at a church btw), I was feeling uneasy and lightheaded so I excused myself to go to the washroom. As I was walking, I got that feeling like I was about to collapse. The next thing I can remember was coming to and see lots of people surrounding me including the bride and groom. Apparently, when I fainted, I fell onto the photographer who was crouched down near me. Not only that, but he dropped the camera lens down and it broke. Tbh I don\u2019t even remember seeing the photographer but I may have been too dizzy or something to have seen him. The wedding was a bit of a cheaper one, so the photographer was a family friend of the grooms who only had one camera with him. The bride was just in tears that she won\u2019t have any good pictures from her wedding. The photographer insisted that he could drive home and grab a different one, but it would take too long. The bride was indeed mad at me, but I feel it was a bit harsh as it was extremely embarrassing for me already. Fainting never even crossed my mind as something that would happen at all.

YTA", "YTA\n\nNot for the fainting, that cannot be controlled, but for not drinking and eating despite being advised to - that CAN be controlled. You are not a little kid, I don't care how busy you were - unless you were running from an erupting volcano, you should have stopped to eat and drink, especially on a hot day.\n\nThis time, you ruined a wedding. Next time, you might endanger yours and someone else's life, depending on the place. Suddenly losing consciousness is not a joke. \n\nApologize, and don't do that again.", "I mean, kinda YTA, sorry - obviously you didn't mean to faint, that wasn't in your control, but by your own admission you didn't eat or drink all day even though you knew it was going to be very hot and you'd been advised to take precautions. And you don't seem to feel particularly bad about breaking the photographer's camera lens when you fell, because it was a \"cheaper\" wedding? It's a very soft YTA since none of this was intentional, but it sounds like you were negligent and then not particularly concerned about the consequences for other people.", "I would say a soft YTA. You obviously didn\u2019t mean any harm or meant to do these things but you also chose to ignore their requests to avoid this very thing from happening. Not getting to have real photos for your wedding day is a big deal. If I were you, I would apologize profusely and not diminish their valid anger in the situation. It sucks but this one\u2019s on you.", "YTA. You were warned that you should eat and drink before the wedding.  Why? Because things like fainting and heat exhaustion are real.  You ignored the advice.  You fainted as a result. You could\u2019ve gotten a pass if you hadn\u2019t fallen on the photographer, but you did.  Because of your choices, the bride does not have the wedding photographs she wanted.  She has every right to be really angry at you as your actions led to that consequence.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you didn\u2019t intend for it to happen.  What matters is that you ignored their advice and the bride suffered as a result.", "Soft YTA You chose to attend the wedding already tired and hungry after choosing not to eat/drink all day even though you were warned beforehand. While you didn't faint on purpose, your choices significantly increased the likelihood of it happening and you messed up their wedding as a result.", "YTA as an adult you should have known better not to hydrate, and you were warned, but chose to ignore it. no one is too busy to drink fucking water ffs. take some responsibility for your health.", "YTA. If you had followed advice and then fainted it would be opposite but you didn\u2019t follow advice.  The resulting fact that you took out the photographer and camera were not down to you - it was circumstantial - but I can see why the bride was upset. All you had to do was drink water and you didn\u2019t and if I had no professional photos cos someone hadn\u2019t followed advice I would be upset too.", "YTA because this was preventable. You were advised to eat and drink and you didn\u2019t. You broke someone\u2019s expensive camera because you didn\u2019t listen. You ruined a wedding by causing a commotion because you didn\u2019t listen. The bride doesn\u2019t get professional photos because of you.", "Soft YTA, you are an adult and chose to ignore advice. It doesn't take long to eat a slice of bread and drink some water.\n\nYou did not faint on purpose of course however you did behave negligently to your health and then are unconcerned by the damage caused to someone else's property and that there won't be professional photographs from the wedding. You do suck a bit for that attitude.", "YTA, while fainting wasn\u2019t intentional you knew to eat and drink before hand and didn\u2019t. i hope you apologize and pay for the lens.", "YTA. How busy are you really that on the day that you know you\u2019re going to a wedding where you are not in the wedding party or involved in any way other than showing up, you are so \u2018extremely busy\u2019 you can\u2019t possibly have time to eat or drink anything? The people whose wedding it was even reminded you to hydrate. At no point in your day did you really not have a moment to grab a drink or a sandwich or something?\n\nPlus, how important are you that on a day you know is going to be hot, you are so hectically busy and have so many vitally important jobs to do that you absolutely cannot find time to at least get a drink? If you are so crazy busy, I\u2019m amazed you managed to even find time to attend the wedding at all!!!!", "YTA. Drinking a bottle of water and eating a sandwich takes 5 minutes.

Almost seems planned to garner as much attention as you could at this 'cheap' wedding.", "YTA. As everyone already said, you did not take the proper precautions which were advised. Even though you cannot control fainting, due to your negligence, the wedding ended up being about you on maybe the most important day in this couple's lives. Lastly, lenses are about $1k, the situation all around sucks.", "What kind of photographer brings one camera to a wedding? Also, everyone there probably had a cell phone camera they could use. Put it portrait mode and start snapping.", "Very Emily in Paris, YTA sorry", "Attention seeker you are\ud83d\ude44", "I\u2019m about to be the asshole here. But I find it hard to believe you drank absolutely nothing, as you stated in your story, prior to 5pm. Busy or not, that doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nI\u2019m kind of getting the vibe that you didn\u2019t really faint\u2026 \n\nI went to a wedding where the bride\u2019s little sister did this. She \u201cfaked\u201d a fainting spell that went away real quick when most people ignored her (things like this were normal for the little sister). She pouted the rest of the wedding because no one would stop the wedding for her.\n\nEdit: I forgot to vote. YTA.", "YTA\nI would offer a photo shoot for the bride and groom as an apology so they can get some additional photos in their wedding clothes.", "NTA idk why everyone is saying you are. I've worked shifts in the sun without eating or drinking and have had no issues, so if you've never fainted before then this would've been unexpected. But now you've learned to keep hydrated and eat throughout the day, this was just an unfortunate accident.", "I would say NAH but it was your fault, just not in the asshole territory. And you really need to take better care of yourself. Not for the sake of inconveniencing others but for yourself. This can really impact your health later on, even if for now you are fine. Eating is a top need. The only thing that is more important is drinking.", "NTA \n\nMaybe you should've followed the advice but there had been times where I didn't have time to eat, especially because getting ready before a wedding takes a lot of time and you kind of have to rush.\n\nYou clearly didn't mean to faint and fall onto the photographer. You even offered to pay ! \n\nIn my opinion documenting every moment isn't necessary and with phone's cameras nowadays they could've take plenty of good quality pictures until the photographer went and replaced his camera. \n\nI've been to a wedding where the best man fainted due to the heat ... twice and they had to pause the ceremony for a bit , it's just basic human decency imo.", "NTA. This was an accident. You didn't practice fainting or intentionally faint on purpose or anything. Accidents happen. Did it out a damper on the event? Yes. But it wasn't intentional and they can be disappointed but to be upset with you seems misplaced. \n\nThis would be entirely different if you got drunk and blacked out and this happened. But that isn't what happened here.", "YTA, and if you weren\u2019t in the wedding, how were you SO busy that you couldn\u2019t take 10 minutes to eat and drink?", "Obviously you\u2019re not the asshole, I feel like you know this though?", "It was an accident. They should have hired a professional if they wanted professional pictures. No decent or experienced photographer shows up to a wedding with just one ANYTHING.", "NTA. While, yes, it was irresponsible to yourself to not drink water on such a hot day, but there was no way to know that you were going to faint the moment that you did. It's a shame that it happened to be on top of the photographer, but there's nothing you can do about that now. Hopefully you learned the hard way why it's important to stay hydrated.", "It was an accident. They should have hired a professional if they wanted professional pictures.

Why would fainting not be something that crosses your mind especially when you were explicitly warned before the wedding to eat and stay hydrated because it was going to be hot? Not eating or drinking until late afternoon is a recipe for fainting anyway, add the heat and it\u2019s even worse. And how are you \u201ctoo busy\u201d to eat or drink anyway? Keep a water bottle near you and drink while you\u2019re doing whatever you\u2019re doing. Keep snacks that are easy to eat while you\u2019re doing whatever you\u2019re doing or take a 10 minute break to eat something (or eat in the car while you\u2019re driving).

The venue being \"cheaper\" doesn't mean the family friend didn't bring something nice because he cares about his friend.)\n\nAND OP is the AH for having little to no remorse that, intentionally or unintentionally, breaking/damaging someone else's property.\n\nAND (*insert animated Uncle meme here \"one MORE thing\"*) OP is the AH for not treating someone else's (and it's for her aunt, too!) wedding with more respect. If you have time to be busy and not eat then you have 30 seconds to sit in the back where you won't disturb anyone if you do faint.\n\nAND OP is the AH for trying to convince us everything is okay because she didn't mean to because she didn't think she would faint. At the very least realize there's a lesson to your experience!\n\nAND OP just the AH for not mentioning how she would apologize to her aunt (the bride)! Not everything is about you, OP. Even as someone who wishes sometimes I would faint so I'd have a reason to be tired and forgetful (it would indicate an ~~acceptable~~ medical reason) I would *never* simply neglect my health, faint at a wedding, and then proceed to be upset that someone is frustrated by the interruption! You didn't even *just* faint, you broke the lens of a professional camera and could have potentially injured the cameraman, not because of a legitimate health condition you couldn't control but because you neglected yourself and you neglected your aunt and you neglected the warning about needing to eat and drink so you don't faint from self-induced heat sickness. If you can't take care of yourself then it's very likely you won't be able to do a good job taking care of others, especially when your health fails.\n\nAND OP is the AH for neglecting her health in the first place. *Busy* doesn't matter. *Busy* can take a backseat. The more your health declines the sooner you'll fail to continue make good decisions. It snowballs and it only takes one moment.\n\nOkay I had to go back and count. OP is 7x the AH. 8 if we want to go on about what seems to be a self-centered approach she has to life.\n\nOP, you need a life change. Go take care of your health. Make a proper apology to the bride & groom (they're a unit now). And find some way to try to make amends for the broken lens, even if all you can (legitimately) afford is a genuine hand-written apology. And then go back and take care of your health again, that's a lifelong habit/chore that's necessary. If you don't prioritize food then perhaps you haven't found the right diet. Diet is more than \"here's something to enter my belly and be digested so I can continue my day\". I personally find that I have to enjoy my food or I'll neglect it as well. Let people hate me but I enjoy American Asian food, burritos, hamburgers, three milk cake, etc, a lot... I experiment with flavors and spices I like. There's a spiced vanilla tea that I don't particularly enjoy, however it was wonderful when I drank it while eating a ((hamburger cooked in sea salt butter) topped with kewpie mayonnaise). Judge me all you want but the combination was far better than just the same old classic hamburger (at least when it comes to my cooking). I did have to babysit the hamburger while it was cooking though. I also like the bibigo! brand chicken dumplings from Walmart dipped in Yum Yum Sauce. And I don't normally eat a chicken sandwich if I haven't *at least* toasted the whole wheat bread first (it gives it a nutty flavor) and add two controlled layers of normal mayonnaise (the first thin layer soaks into the warm toasted bread to slightly soften it, the second normal layer is for taste). Adding shreds of fresh rosemary or a smattering of fresh horseradish when I can afford it just makes it amazing, but adding tomato to any variation overpowers the other flavors of the sandwich. Just eat something delicious, okay, OP?", "first of all, how is someone *too busy* to drink water like I don't understand it's such a simple motion just twist and sip lol wtf. \n\n\nAs someone who doesn't faint, I always carry a water with me especially with how hot this summer has been, you're asking for trouble if you can't can't be bothered to bring something to hydrate with in this heat. \n\n& then she's nonchalant about breaking someone's personal belongings, and possible side hustle, just because it was \"cheap\", which unless it was a digital camera from the value store I doubt it was cheap, is just arrogant and rude.

My question is how did the photographer not notice? Usually before someone faints you can see them starting to fall , unless he was RIGHT next to her he may have had time to move. Not saying its hsi fault because its not but if i was there and saw someone was about to faint i would have tried to move and asked them if they were okay.

I guess you shouldn't love your aunt according to roughly 100 people.\n\nPeople who don't agree with the OP just downvote all their comments.", "Yeah.  Even if it had been an freak accident op would owe the photographer for his camera.  She seems to care far more about her embarrassment than the harm she did to other people.  Accidents do happen but she won't even own up to that and apologize", "Yes, because you buying new lens wouldn't change the fact that your lack of consideration and understanding of something as basic as \"dehydration and starvation on a hot day will most probably cause some sort of medical emergency\" after being directly warned robed your aunt of normal wedding pictures. The photographer has other lenses, he just couldn't bring them in time (which, yes, he should've prepared a spare lens), so what buying a new lens would change? You ate one granola bar, why not eat some more? Why not grab a bottle of water? How much time could it possibly take?", "That\u2019s my point too. OP was warned & found out why the hard why", "I spoke at a funeral for a family member during the summer months and I went up to the podium with a bottle of water. I didn't eat much in the morning of, but I still had my mind together to drink water.", "That's okay. I don't recall there being a requirement to be 100% normal 24/7 or gtfo. *continued running like the gingerbread man but fatter, while yelling into the sunset* FOOD IS IMPOOORTAAAANT *fades off into the distance* when it tastes good... *silence because even the crickets don't know what to make of me*", "+1 upvotes though and btw I like your username.", "Projection is a hell of a thing", "Upvoted! +1 to your ~~charisma~~ awesome.", "Lets be real here, OP is not going to do any of these things.", "That's just kinda how the sub is. The \"AH\" of the story will show remorse and genuinely try to make up for what trouble they cause but people will downvote because \"Grrrr you assol me angy bad bad \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c\"", "A meal is gonna replace photos from a day they get once? Yeah\u2026.", "The professional part is the person holding the camera not just the camera. Why wouldn\u2019t the photographer use their phone? Also the photographer can edit cell phone photos pretty well. Source- I was a wedding photographer", "They also said they \"would never do something like\" what they did lol", "Mostly because they said they would never do anything like that on a post about them doing exactly something like that.", "*Ye old tale of fuck around and find out*\n\nShame about the ruined wedding photos for the bride.", "But, but, but.....she was BUSY.  /s", "My aunt is diabetic (T1DM). On the day of my grandad/her dad's funeral, she started to hypo because she hadn't eaten enough and stress. We pulled over on the way to the funeral to get her to eat something. It was insidious as she didn't think she was having a hypo but as soon as she ate she realised she had been impaired. She's usually pretty good with all the diabetes care but it was a pretty awful day and had other concerns", "Find out what lens you broke and send him the money. They are incredibly expensive and if he's not a professional he probably hasn't got insurance. He'll be out probably over a thousand dollars.", "You literally send them the money through an etransfer/ vemno or whatever, ask your aunt for the details, it's the right thing to do, he's just being polite \n\nI can't believe you had to ask if you were the asshole in this situation lol\n\nhopefully a learning situation!", "Pay\u2026for\u2026it\u2026anyway", "How many times did you ask? The truth.", "What else can you do to move forward besides that?", "Even the best phone cameras don\u2019t compare to the quality a high end camera will give. What if the photographer has a shit phone camera? This was OP\u2019s fault for ignoring her health and it backfired on the bride and groom.", "I took it as intentionally. Everyone comprehends things differently. I just read a post talking about that earlier.", "And the camera that the friend now has to repair or replace since they likely don\u2019t have insurance", "I'm trying to figure out what a non-wedding party member is so busy with day of. I get other people/normal guests might do other things prior to the wedding, but like.... Does OP just make a habit of not eating all day?", "That\u2019s true I will be doing that", "Buy them more than a meal\u2026like a new photography session? And insisting the photographer take payment", "Plus who says the aunt has to move forward? This wasn\u2019t a medical emergency, this was app, an adult, making a conscious decision to not take care of herself before a big event. A wedding takes a while no matter how hot and she didn\u2019t prepare properly, therefore ruining the chance of pictures.\n\nBecause no matter what, that night and those pictures can NEVER be given back to the Aunt.", "Yeah that too.\n\n\"They insisted I didn't pay for it\"\n\nDon't care, pay for it.", "You can offer this, but it\u2019s still not going to be a time machine back to their wedding day which the original post it is about. Doing those things as compensation could be nice and could repair relationships, but it will not be the same as if the wedding was never ruined. You can\u2019t take that back.", "I\u2019m not referring to the aunt moving forward, you misinterpreted what I said. How can OP move forward\u2014 as it looks like we are in agreement, you can\u2019t do the day over. To an extent, there is only ao much you can do."]}
