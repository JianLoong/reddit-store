This feels like a massive power play, especially since you moved", "You can accept that this person has transitioned and still not accept what a shitty parent they were to you. NTA.", "You are accepting her for who she is:  a horribly abusive, unapologetic hypocrite.

I'm not refusing to accept her transition, I'm refusing to accept her parenting.\"\n\nNTA.

She is the person who never apologized for it and thinks you owe her something.", "NTA- you can accept your that your abusive parent is trans from afar. I literally cannot believe that she doorstepped you. That is INCREDIBLY intrusive and entitled. Your parent chose to abuse you. Their gender dysphoria isn\u2019t a reason to hurt a their child.

I hope find peace and let that bitch know that being trans IS NOT the problem in your relationship.", "You\u2019re not rejecting her for transitioning, you\u2019re rejecting her for abusing you.

If not, feel free to contact me and I will give you some recommendations for a good therapist. \n\nAlso, YOU get to choose who you have in your life. Your parent raised you. That does not guarantee a relationship with them. That\u2019s earned. Not given. Your mom is acting in a way that isn\u2019t affirming or accepting of you and she is ignoring all the abuse she heaped on you growing up. Now she may not see her discipline as abuse.

But you definitely don\u2019t owe her anything - forgiveness or even an active relationship.\n\nETA: sorry if I may have used the wrong pronouns.

There needs to be some recognition, a request for forgiveness and you need to grant that forgiveness. She stole a portion of your life from you.  I have no doubt that religious extremism was projection. It\u2019s almost textbook. But that doesn\u2019t change what was done.", "Omg this has got to be so hard. I'm so sorry. NTA, and your parent has a lot to apologize for, and I really hope one day your parent realized the trauma they put you through", "Her transition doesn\u2019t make your pain any less valid. Regardless of if she\u2019s learned to embrace her identity or not, reality is she shamed, belittled, and abused you for yours. Rather than worrying about accepting her, first worry about whether or not you want to *forgive* her in the first place for all the pain she\u2019s caused you. She sees this as you rejecting her identity, but for you it\u2019s so much bigger than her identity. It\u2019s your trauma. *That\u2019s* what\u2019s making this so hard for you and understandably so. On top of that, rather than acknowledging the past that hurt you so much, she victimized herself where she should have been *begging* for your forgiveness. That has nothing to do with her transition and has everything to do with her being a shit person and an even shittier mom. Op, I\u2019m so fucking sorry. Please, don\u2019t think for a second about her\u2019s or the family\u2019s feelings. Not yet. Think about what\u2019s healthiest for you. **PRIORITIZE YOU**\n\nNta.", "NTA and accepting them and their transition does not mean you have to let them into your life.

I wanted to be clear about that so you know where this comes from. You are NTA. The things that your parent dof to you are abuse. Shoving someone in a closet for 14 hours is nothing but abuse. I'm shocked you didn't continue the NC. You don't have to call them Mom if you don't want. You should discuss with them what you'd like to call them. Needing time to accept their transition isn't outrageous. You have every right to be angry about how you were treated. I hope things get better for you.", "NTA", "NTA - So they punished you for 14hours when you were a still a kid for claiming to be bisexual, and he transitions and magically expects you to just accept it? After all those years of abuse and forced religion he should let you lock him in a closet for 14 hours and then some just to chip the top of the iceberg of forgiveness. That's what I would do lol", "NTA. You were abused and your parent's gender isn't the issue here. You have every right to stay NC or take the time you need to accept the change. The fact that there wasn't even any acknowledgement/apology for your past treatment is horrible.  I hope that you are able to get therapy/healing from your past and move forward in whatever way makes you happy.", "NTA- your parent was abusive. You were abused.\n\nYou can accept them as transgender, but you do not have to accept the excuses for their choice to abuse you and not even offer an apology. You don't have to accept the apology either. \n\nI do think however, you need to speak to a therapist. \nPotentially both of you going to see a family therapist too. I say this so that you have the safe space to call them out on their abuse and to hopefully get it through their head that no matter what, they were abusive and that behaviour was never acceptable. Then go NC. \n\n\n\"Hey parent, now that you've shared this, get in the closet. You can't come out until I hear you praying\" \n\n\nVery very different when the tables are turned.", "NTA- You are treating this person as the person they have always been: the person who gave you a miserable time due to their own issues. Your feelings about your parent have in no way changed due to their transition. That is entirely egalitarian.", "NTA this has nothing to do with being fair to her or not. This is about her abusing you for years and having no willingness to take responsibility. She wants you to accept she's transitioned and is a woman. Fine. Doesn't change the fact that she was an abusive and shitty parent and you need never accept that. When family members blow up your phone, have a rote reply:\n\nIt seems that you think transitioning to female absolves a parent of relentless physical and emotional child abuse. I still bear the scars inflicted on my by my parent and have no interest in having a relationship with someone who hurt me so deeply and has absolutely no remorse, nor am I interested in having a relationship with anybody who thinks child abuse is excusable. That would be you. Do not contact me again. \n\nAnd then block the fuck out of them all.", "NAH - It sounds like your issue isn't really with the transition, but in the poor upbringing coupled with using the transition as a means to demand acceptance. Your now-mother was an asshole parent, but is no doubt going through a difficult time so I won't place too much blame on her for trying to reach out to you during a very critical moment in her life, and certainly won't on you for not being eager to celebrate someone that it sounds like you don't really want back in your life.\n\nIf nothing else, try to make sure you're making the distinction between the transition and the existing trauma. You can be accepting of the transition while still making it abundantly clear that it doesn't resolve the past.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
