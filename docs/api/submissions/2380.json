Which then she would say she doesn't even live her/isn't on the lease/etc. Which I said that I could get all of that arranged and make it official, which my roommate just said \"No\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI pay significantly more rent even though I don't have the \"master room\" (my roommate does and she has her own private bath and \\*plenty\\* of space to call her own), and the utilities my gf does use, are negligible at most (I compared bills, its maybe a two dollar difference?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy GF's daughter (9) does spend the night maybe 4-5 days a week at the apartment, but she is relatively quiet, doesn't bother my roommate and sleeps on an inflatable mattress either in my room or in the living room (my roommate \\*usually\\* goes to bed around 8 or 9pm, so if my roommate goes to her room, we move my GF's daughter to the living room that way everyone can have a bit more privacy) we have asked my roommate maybe twice what time she is planning on going to bed so we can try to adjust our plans if need be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNotes: My roommate frequently leaves the front door unlocked with nobody being home, even though I've asked her plenty of times to please lock it behind her. Any mess that is made by us is immediately cleaned up. If my roommate is home she is always in the common areas. We try to keep noise down to a minimum, and adjust if my roommate mentions something (I've also asked to make sure she doesn't hear anything, but thankfully the walls are fairly thick in this apartment). My roommate also sometimes watches dogs for extra money in the apartment without strictly asking me about it, she just tells me the dates that there will be dogs in the apartment, which I also help walk if my roommate decides to spend hours away from the apartment (which is frequent).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo...

I saw the notes about your roommates flaws but two wrong doesn\u2019t make right.\nTalk to her and find an agreement or move out.", "YTA and your gf is too, the kid needs her own space and  not sleep on a inflatable bed in your room. Wtf is wrong with both of you? You are both 30+ and dragging this kid around like she has no needs. She needs to sleep in her home, in her own bed.", "Yes **YTA** as this is now 4 people in the home, but your roommate only signed up for 2.", "Dude your entitlement is through the roof YTA. You admit that you live in a small apartment and you see no issues with moving in two people. You don't see it but your roommate has had to adjust their comfort and living to suit your needs and that's entirely unfair", "YTA. No matter how many details you add to make it seem like we should favor you, it\u2019s not working. Your roommate only signed up for two people living in that apartment. No matter if you pay more rent or not, that is a different problem that you guys seemed to come to an arrangement on. You can just throw that in her face because you want it to benefit you now. \n\nAdding in another adult is already one thing, but adding a nine year old kid is a whole other thing. I don\u2019t care if she doesn\u2019t mind sleeping on an air mattress, that is no way for a child to live and grow up. Of course she would choose the air mattress, she wants to be with her mom! \n\nYou need to respect your roommates boundaries.", "YTA. I really feel like you are downplaying the daughters presence. 4 to 5 days a week is a lot of time and you are telling me that a nine year old isn't being a typical nine year old while she is there? This space is just as much your roommates as it is yours and you should both be respectful of that. If the situation is really as bad as you think it is, then why don't you and your girlfriend just get your own place?", "This is a terrible situation for that 9 year old. Your girlfriend needs to get her sh*t together, your roommate is right,and you need to make a decision to either commit and move in with this woman and her kid in a new apartment (which also doesn't seem great for a 9 year old). The 9 year old shouldn't have to sleep in the living room 4-5 nights a week on an inflatable mattress in a common space. That's so terrible. Your poor roommate and that poor child. You guys are selfish af", "YTA - I could see maybe one night a week, but most nights? nope. If i were your roommate, I'd be pissed too. its not about you not taking up the common space, etc. its the mere fact that someone ELSE, some times two more people, are spending significant amounts of time in THEIR home. \n\nthe best situation would be for you and your GF to get an apartment together.", "YTA I don\u2019t even know how you can be clueless enough to need the long explanation.  You\u2019re no longer suited to a roommate situation.  You live with gf and her daughter.", "YTA.. you basically just moved in a family without discussing it with someone who also pays rent..", "Yta. Your roommate didn\u2019t sign up for this and you clearly didn\u2019t discuss it with her before hand. Which is what you should do when you live in a shared space. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve ever voiced your concerns to your roommate. The way you explain it, sounds like you\u2019re going tit for tat with your roommate", "Dude, YTA! Your roomate has every right to say no. 3 ppl  she did not sign up for and you changed the arrangement. Get your own damn place.", "YTA.  And no amount of \u201cjustifying\u201d\nFrom you is going to change that. \n\nI would be very careful if i were you. Your lease agreement may have some clause about overnights guests, and violating your lease.\n\nBut just because you have a gf and want to get laid is no reason to violate your roommate\u2019s right to live comfortably in her own home.\n\nGrow up and move out - get your own place.  Or send your gf back to her place with her child until you can grow up.", "YTA. Your roommate and her daughter have basically moved in and that's something you and your roommate should have agreed upon beforehand.", "Lord you're the nightmare roommate everyone dreads. If it were your roommate writing in I would tell her to check the lease. They almost all restrict overnight guests to 2-3 nights a week. Having someone over most nights is in effect moving in an unauthorized roommate. She should remind you that you're violating the lease, then report you to the landlord if you don't stop.\n\nYou and your gf need to ask if you can sublet your room and find a place by yourselves. No one paying rent for a single roommate situation wants to be in a 3 roommate situation. It's unfair and, almost always, an illegal violation of your rental agreement.\n\nYTA.", "YTA and you\u2019re likely breaking the lease.", "You say that your roommate was chill about in the beginning, but not anymore. Don't you see how its like offering the devil a finger and he then takes your whole hand? \n\nYTA. Living with a roommate and living with a family are two very different things. 5 days a week is the same as living there. Don't you see how awkward you've made your roommate's home life? And then you try to justify it with arguments, that are completely different issues and should be discussed separately.", "YTA your GF and her child are essentially living with you! who are you kidding? they are using the water, electricity and the polluted indoor air.

Of course *you* don\u2019t think it\u2019s disruptive.  You\u2019re the only one who gets any benefit from having to navigate around a whole other person you didn\u2019t ask for, never mind a *kid* **regularly sleeping out in the common room** (which, Jesus Christ, does kid have *any* other relatives?  Are *they* okay with this?).\n\nIf you\u2019re unhappy with your roommate doing stuff *you* don\u2019t like, take this as your cue to move out with your girlfriend and get her kid an actual damn bedroom that doesn\u2019t contain you or random roommates.  Don\u2019t use it to justify how you\u2019re handling this, because you can\u2019t.", "Huge YTA. This is absolutely ridiculous.

What\u2019s next a puppy?", "YTA. They have moved into the apartment. Either find a new apartment you can share with your girlfriend, or start splitting the rent and utilities into thirds.", "YTA, of course your room mate isn't going to be ok with this situation. Your girlfriend and her daughter (!!!) will be using utilities (water, gas, electric etc) and therefore should be contributing. Your room mate is essentially having to cover the additional costs of 2 additional people stay 2/3rds of the week and I see from comments you keep trying to justify it that you pay more rent but that isn't the point. You're likely making your room mate really uncomfortable, I know I would be if my room mate moved in 2 additional people without asking me, because that is basically what you have done, and I'd be surprised if it doesn't break a lease agreement.   \nPlus you say you don't use the living area, but you move the kid and the air mattress in there as soon as your room mate leaves that area so you are using it!", "YTA, your girlfriend and child have essentially moved into your apartment.", "yta. why don\u2019t you and your girlfriend just get your own place? instead of living with other people", "YTA obviously. You can\u2019t just move two people into an already cramped apartment especially when one of them is a kid. Your roommate agreed to live with you and that is it. The fact you didn\u2019t even talk to her is even worse. Not everybody wants to live with kids.", "YTA\n\nIf it was just your apartment and your roommate wasn\u2019t on the lease, then you wouldn\u2019t be TA.\n\nBut your roommate IS on the lease. Regardless of how much either of you pay (that\u2019s on the both of you BTW\u2014landlords don\u2019t normally care how it\u2019s split, just as long as they get their money), that\u2019s her space too.", "YTA\n\nAnd your girlfriend is revolting for dragging her kid around to sleep on a blow up mattress at her boyfriends house 5 nights a week. How bloody unstable of a mother.", "YTA.", "YTA.  She is not paying rent and using all the facilities.  You are the worst kind of roommate.  Not okay, not okay at all.", "YTA - Your roommate signed a lease to live with one other adult. Not two adults and a child. What you are doing is incredibly obnoxious. Some leases also have limits on how long guests can stay (e.g. how many nights in a month), so you may even be violating your lease.", ">I honestly don't feel like she is moving in, since all of her stuff is in strictly my room, t\n\nHe said \"She's not moving in because of she moved all her stuff in my room\"\n\nA+ jokes", "YTA.  You're being a terrible roommate.  Just having your GF over 4-5 nights a week without your roommate's blessing would make you a bad roommate.  Then we get to the child who's sleeping in the living room sometimes?  How does this seem at all reasonable?\n\nDid you and your roommate discuss overnight guests before living together?  Next time, have that discussion up front, and have a written agreement so everyone is on the same page.\n\nYour roommate's dog sitting is also problematic, but it sounds like you were fine with that until your roommate objected to you \"technically not\" moving in your GF without their agreement.  So that means it wasn't actually a problem before.  Tolerating something from a roommate doesn't entitle you to do something else they have to tolerate - it only works that way if you both specifically agree to it.", "YTA and i really hope your roommate reports you to the office", "YTA. This is awful behaviour towards your roommate as well as this child.", "YTA Your girlfriend/her daughter ALREADY live with you and stay with you 80-90% out of their lives. Stop the BS. YTA and you know it.", "YTA. So your girlfriend and her kid are freeloaders? It is shared space.", "YTA - move out and get your own apartment with your gf and her \"relatively quiet\" kid.", "YTA\n\nYou have moved 2 people into your home without a conversation with the other resident of the home.", "YTA", "YTA. Someone tried something like this with me once and my apartment that was supposed to have 2 people now magically had 3 people. Pissed me off. They weren't paying any extra rent or anything. After I said something about it, the extra person left without an argument. They knew they were in the wrong.\n\nYou're making it even worse since you have 4 people.", "There is nothing to discuss because you **did** move your girlfriend and her daughter in without the approval of your roommate. Your entitled attitude only further warrants the verdict of **YTA**", "YTA especially for the daughter in the living room. Your roommate may be going to bed at 8 or 9 but what happens if she needs something in the common area in the middle of the night or wakes up early before the kid? Having your girlfriend over that much is rude but I feel like a common roommate issue. The addition of her daughter is insane.", "YTA - I like how you tried to phrase how quiet you all are and how respectful and blah blah, look, your roommate chose to live with you. By opening the door to someone else, you are forcing your roommate to involuntarily live with someone else. What happens if you and your gf fight? What happens if your gf's 9-year-old accidentally injures herself while at your place, and then your roommate sees it first? You are forcing your roommate to live with your gf and her daughter no matter how quiet or non-existent she may seem. Get your own place or hang out elsewhere but stop forcing your roommate to live with a woman and child she doesn't know.", "I had a roommate like you and 100% YTA", "YTA, if your girlfriend and child are spending more nights at your place then they live with you!!!!", "Yta and get your own apartment with your gf. So your gf daughter spending 4-5 days there so what is your gf spending 6 and your saying you all sleep in one room?  It's probably breaking the lease. You need your own place with gf and her kid then.", "YTA \n\nStay at your GF house. I know they have more people there but they signed up for that many right, the kids stuff is there. Sticking the kid in the living room/common area so you two can have sex is pathetic. Be adult about this talk to your roommate so she can start saving money or looking for a new place with decent people.", "YTA just because you\u2019re not in \u201cshared spaces\u201d in the apartment doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s problematic that the gf and child are over as often as they are. You need to compromise with your roommate and set up some boundaries for them before you continue to abuse your shared apartment agreement.", "YTA without a doubt", "YTA. \n\nI pulled this stunt when I was 23: my boyfriend more or less moved into my house with roommates. My housemates were rightly upset, so we changed up the utilities so they'd be split over more people and my boyfriend could pay his share. I don't understand why you don't think you're the asshole here.", "Yta and your girlfriend is not a good parent. She\u2019s dragging a 9 year old around to various homes. She has her sleeping on an air mattress at her current boyfriend\u2019s house more than half the week! Terrible example she\u2019s setting, terrible example you\u2019re participating in. This kid needs stability and to not be treated like an afterthought.", "YTA. Spending g the night 4-5 times a week means she\u2019s moved in.  And I bet roommate is not thrilled about a child living there as well( nobody cares that you say she\u2019s polite, quiet, etc.  she\u2019s a kid and a disruptive presence.  Period.  ) \n\nHow would you feel essentially being relegated to your bedroom and not being able to enjoy the rest of the house? \n\nSomebody needs to move.", "INFO: Did your roommate agree to living with your girlfriend and her 9 yo child or have you just decided that having 2 house guests 5 nights a week is appropriate?\n\nWhat does your lease say about overnight guests?", "When you have a roommate, you have to be respectful of the shared spaces.\n\nIf you have a guest over 5 days a week, then your guest is essentially living there, using the utilities, the cable, the wifi etc etc and not having to pay anything extra\n\nYour roommate is not getting an equal share of the shared space because your guests are always there.  \n\nYTA and you should be paying 70% of the rent, utilities, and internet since you moved people in without asking your roommates permission", "Yes YTA. You did basically move your gf and her kid into your place without talking with your room mate. 4/5 days a week is more than the majority of the week. Sounds like you and your gf need to figure out do your ready to actually live together full time and get you own place if so. If not, limit her and her kid staying over and leaving personal belongings there. The issue you have with your room mate and dog sitting is one to address with her life she is with this situation.", "YTA and so is your girlfriend. I\u2019ve seen people treat their pets with more consideration than you two treat her daughter. I feel sorry for the poor kid. I\u2019m also annoyed on behalf of your roommates for the entitlement you reek of.", "YTA. Jesus that poor kid. Kids need a schedule, consultancy, and security. That kid does not deserve to be moved around constantly and sleeping on a blow up mattress in the same room as his mom and her bf. You are doing way more damage than you think to that poor kid, even if you think your intentions are pure/noble. She needs her own room and she needs to not be moving from one place to the other every few days. That\u2019s so wrong. She shouldn\u2019t have to be \u201cworried\u201d about being quiet and polite. She\u2019s a KID!!\n\nAlso YTA to your roommate. I would be livid if my roommate surprised me by bringing in two new ppl.", "I don't understand this. You pay 70% of the rent and your roommate has the Master and her own bathroom. It sounds like she needs to move out so your gf and her daughter can move in legitimately. Is that not an option? Why did you agree to this?", "Yta. Her and her child use more then a dollar or two worth of utilities. The child sleeps in the living room common area and of course the kitchen another common area is used.", "YTA, when you had the discussion with your roommate about your girlfriend and her daughter spending the night did you tell your roommate they would be spending the night 4 to 5 times a week? I am betting you said it would only be a couple times a week. If you so badly want to spend time with your girlfriend then do so but send her home to her own place every night. Your gf is losing money every week if she is paying rent elsewhere while staying at your place.\nPut yourself in your roommates shoes and see how\u2019d you feel if two people you didn\u2019t know basically moved in. They are using the kitchen and common space. I am betting the apartment is a little bit louder and definitely feels more crowded. Your roommate has every right to be upset, they didn\u2019t sign up to live three people, they only signed up to live with one. \nAnd that poor kid, she needs stability and this situation is not stable for her. She may seem happy but I bet she is not but you and your gf are too blinded to think otherwise. Please reevaluate everything and then apologize to your roommate.", "Sorry but YTA, you are in a roommate situation and basically brought in another roommate who doesn't contribute but is there in the apartment with the other roommate. She either needs to help pay or not be there so much.", "YTA.", "So instead of 2 people, there are 4 people living in the apartment 4-5 days a week. This is not the deal your roommate signed for, and you should count yourself lucky that she is communicating with you - and not the landlord.\n\nIf you plan to keep the girlfriend and her child, you should start seeking new accommodations.\n\nNTA", "Love how everyone is pointing out that OP is TA for common sense reasons, and he's STILL arguing with everyone in the comments. So OP - YTA even more for not accepting your judgments. Saying they're \"only there 4-5\u201d nights a week is basically saying they live with you and are visiting the aunt's on the weekend.", "YTA. Obviously. 5 days a week? really bro? This is a question in your mind?", "How long have you been with the gf?\nAlso you saying you pay more knowing you don't have master well you should be paying more you have 3 people living there vs 1 90% of the time.", "You\u2019re basically mentioning a bunch of stuff your roommate does \u201cwrong\u201d thinking it\u2019ll get people to agree that you\u2019ve pretty much moved two people into the apartment, including a child, without her consent and it\u2019s not an AH move. \n\nYTA.", "YTA but honestly your flatmates annoyance is nothing compared to this poor kid. She has to sleep on an air mattress in your room or the lounge? So I guess she puts in the lounge when you guys wanna have sex? Urgh she needs soooo much more. \n\nI would have voted ESH as I think the mum is ultimately responsible for looking after her kid, but that would imply flatmate is in the wrong.", "YTA\n\nLOVE how you focused so much on how little STUFF the gf's has there and then sneak in a whole kid 4-5 days a week.\n\nBro. that's burying the lede.\n\nYou guys are taking over the apartment. You want to say two whole human being there for 5/7 days a week at least and you think the utilities went up $2??\n\nIf you wanna live with them as a happy family unit, get your own apartment or put them on the lease properly and have them pay their share.", "YTA. Been in the same situation and even if you spent most of the time in your room, it still isn\u2019t right. There\u2019s just this feeling you get when there are more people around your sanctuary. You added two other people to the living space without your roommates consent. That\u2019s not cool. \n\nAlso, just curious but why is your roommate paying less than you when she has the bigger room with an attached bathroom?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4-5 nighst s week is effectively moved in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu need to stop. And in the meantime, start paying 3/4 of the utilities.", "Yta", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you have issues w the sharing of common space and the dog sitting, you do the adult thing and discuss it.

Do you want to find someone to take over my lease or shall I?\"\n\nReally, your lack of communication here is the biggest reason you're here in the first place.

However your roommate is dead wrong for taking over the common spaces and complaining when you want to use them and bringing over dogs without checking with you. I also think it's ridiculous that you pay significantly more rent if she is the one with the more convenient bathroom)bedroom arrangement.

If you already have a plan to move out and live with your gf and her child, then just wait for that. It\u2019s incredibly inconsiderate to move strangers (they are strangers to your roommate) in to your shared apartment and expect your roommate to be okay with it just because you pay more rent. The rent was agreed upon without the condition that you could move other people in as you see fit. What if she had a bf with a kid and they were staying over 5 nights a week? I don\u2019t know anyone who would be happy with that.", "NTA. controversial i know but 1. You pay more of the bills than your roommate does and you don't even get the master bedroom. 2. you offered to have your girlfriend put in the list and your roommate said no. 3. maybe your girlfriends kid shouldn't be there all that time but your roommate literally has dogs over and doesn't even completely watch them (you said you walk them sometimes when she isn't there.) and doesn't ask if your comfortable with it, A human is different than an Animal and if she has an issue with the daughter being there, the dog shouldn't be there either.\n\nEdit 1. What you are TA for is a child having to sleep on a blow up mattress. She's a child, she needs a bed.

Which then she would say she doesn't even live her/isn't on the lease/etc. Which I said that I could get all of that arranged and make it official, which my roommate just said \"No\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI pay significantly more rent even though I don't have the \"master room\" (my roommate does and she has her own private bath and \\*plenty\\* of space to call her own), and the utilities my gf does use, are negligible at most (I compared bills, its maybe a two dollar difference?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy GF's daughter (9) does spend the night maybe 4-5 days a week at the apartment, but she is relatively quiet, doesn't bother my roommate and sleeps on an inflatable mattress either in my room or in the living room (my roommate \\*usually\\* goes to bed around 8 or 9pm, so if my roommate goes to her room, we move my GF's daughter to the living room that way everyone can have a bit more privacy) we have asked my roommate maybe twice what time she is planning on going to bed so we can try to adjust our plans if need be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNotes: My roommate frequently leaves the front door unlocked with nobody being home, even though I've asked her plenty of times to please lock it behind her. Any mess that is made by us is immediately cleaned up. If my roommate is home she is always in the common areas. We try to keep noise down to a minimum, and adjust if my roommate mentions something (I've also asked to make sure she doesn't hear anything, but thankfully the walls are fairly thick in this apartment). My roommate also sometimes watches dogs for extra money in the apartment without strictly asking me about it, she just tells me the dates that there will be dogs in the apartment, which I also help walk if my roommate decides to spend hours away from the apartment (which is frequent).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo... Reddit.... AITA for having my GF/GF's child over most nights even though we respect everyone's privacy and space as much as we possibly can?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Now I am out of the house way more, so... less electricity. I pay for the majority of the utilities already, she helps pay for the static utilities like Internet, so them staying there doesn't have an impact on her financially.", "My roommate only helps pay the fixed cost utilities. I pay for the variable utilities.", "I feel so bad for this little girl, having to choose an air mattress on the floor in a place she isn\u2019t wanted (because a 9 year old will definitely pick up on that!!!) just to sleep under the same roof as her mother 4/7 nights of the week", "An idiot who shouldn\u2019t be allowed to co-raise a child at least 4/7 of the time, soon to be 7/7.", "Yeah, really. Sounds like the roommate is taking advantage of OP, tbh, would be pretty dumb of her to blow that up.", "OP, even though you insist that moving your family into your shared apartment doesn\u2019t affect your roommate, obviously it does.  Your roommate has told you so. \n\nMaybe there is a compromise your roommate would agree to that wouldn\u2019t require your family to move out.  But continuing to ignore your roommate\u2019s concerns won\u2019t get you there.", "I live in a 2BR apartment larger than that and it would feel TINY with an additional adult AND A KID in here.

Spend it at your gfs as a family who is eventually going to live together.  Have gf come over sometimes for private time when aunt is expecting to supervise child.  Use this time to grow up.

Why does she only pay 1/3rd of thr rent and have the master?", "would you mind if your roommate started seeing a woman with a child and brought a second nine year old into the home? Now they can spend every night together on air mattresses in the living room with no parents or stability around and every day is a party for the kids!\n\nYou mention your roommate telling you every date she brings DOGS over to your apartment.

Or is she out and about most days and nights. ???", "She's quiet and stays in your room all the time, yet she's out and about most if the day. She's at your apartment most of the week, but also at her aunt's house half the time. \n\nYour descriptions are completely self-serving and somehow in every situation you nd your squatters are perfect angels and do nothing wrong. \n\nGet your own place before unilaterally moving your girlfriend and her child into your apt. Also, your girlfriend should be looking for stable housing instead of being more concerned with getting laid and ignoring her responsibilities.", "And what else could the kid even say upon questioning? That she feels uncomfortable?", "But what is the struggle? You and your roommate agreed to live with one another. Any concessions that have been made, have been agreed to by both parties. You are unilaterally deciding that *2* additional people can spend 70%+ of the time in the week there. That is incredibly rude and inconsiderate. \n\nYou agreed to pay more.\n\nYou agreed to let her have the primary suite space.\n\nShe did *NOT* agree to live with your girlfriend and her kid.\n\nYTA.", "I mean what is the struggle. You\u2019re inconveniencing the roommate on their dime. Your gf has a house. She can stay home. And stop making her kid sleep on a mattress.

She is also living with an adult she does not know, and an adult that does not like her.\n\nOther than that, Id argue that your gf and her daughter, are actually living in your apartment, which I guess is not in the contract you have signed. They are basically squading", "Dude the one creating issues is you not roomate, if she sucks with other roommates okay, but right now, the entitled, nightmare roommate is you", "well it looks like she has more issues with you right now so i\u2019m not sure why she wouldn\u2019t jump at the chance to switch things up.", "Uhhhhh only *now* that you have essentially moved your gf in?", "You need to move your girlfriend out", "Except that being on the lease you would still be on the hook for the rent along with her, even if you\u2019re no longer living there\u2026", "You don't need to move.

You're being unreasonable for expecting your roommate to deal with this and I guarantee you're breaking an overnight guest clause in your lease.", "Honestly, so sad too bad. You don\u2019t have to see your GF 5 days a week. Two days max at your apartment is fine. Otherwise pop a claritan and suck it up at your GFs place.

Three adults and a nine-year-old, one of whom is not a part of the ad hoc family unit, is a real stretch.

People break leases and make reports to landlords for much, much less.", "A child this young doesn\u2019t normally choose on the daily. when stable options are available.
