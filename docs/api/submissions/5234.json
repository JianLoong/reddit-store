Of course you don't HAVE to bring your husband to something, and you are not responsible for her terrible in-laws.\n\nBut the other way of looking at this question is that your sister is struggling.

She should really be questioning her in-laws needing to see another person to somehow treat her better. I think you were trying to be considerate of your husband time and mental health, that comes first. This is her issue, not you and your husband responsibility.", "op=nta\n\nYour husband is not your sister's service dog/emotional support animal.\n\nthat is a ridiculous request on her part.", "Is your husband royal or george clooney or something? I need to know what's so special about him.", "This is the dumbest post.", "Why is your sister marrying into a family that cares more about status and YOUR husband instead of who she is? I hope her future groom is worth it.", "YTA as it appears you didn\u2019t extend your sister\u2019s invitation to your husband.  It was his decision to make.", "Yikes! Your sister has no idea what she's in for ...\nNTA", "Info: why particular your husband. Is he famous or well- known?", "Who is your husband?", "You and your husband are not tools to boost up her social life. \n\nIf she cares more about her status then, would I be you, I would go no contact with her until she realises she can't use people like this.", "NTA. this feels like a problem sister needs to address with her future husband and his parents.", "NTA.  Good on you for marrying someone who's apparently \"higher status\", but you're actually considerate of him as a person.  Your sister needs to understand that a husband is not an exotic bird you wear on your shoulder so that assholes decide you're cool.  (I'd say maybe the problem is only her, not her future in-laws, but they did change, which implies it's both.)", "When OPs husband is played all party members get an +5 wealth booster and surrounding inlaws bitterness goes down by -7. \n\nHusband is vulnerable to water and poison. \n\nHusband can cast \"charm\" on the whole party as ultimate. \n\nOp can cast \"doom mood\" when husband is down. Roll d20 for initiative, OP.", "Or even just invited him. It doesn\u2019t sound like OP said one word to her husband.", "...OP is an asshole because of how they phrased their post? And it isn't \"his family\" it's his extended family. He's the sisters brother *in law* not brother. So yeah, asking him to clear his schedule to go to sister in laws party so that the future in laws can be impressed with his social status would be asking husband to do OP a favor for OP's sister, AKA clearing his schedule for OP. I highly doubt he'd be clearing his busy work schedule to go impress his sister-in-laws future parents-in-law for anything other than as a favor for the OP.", "She told him about it. If he wanted to go he would have made sure to clear his schedule. That's a pretty big clue that he wasn't arsed. Why should he haul his arse on an 8 hour flight just to appease the sister?", "Because he was stressed about work and didn't want to make things worse. It's a long haul flight from London to NY. I would be surprised if he even wanted to make that flight just for an engagement party. It's not Op's fault sis's future family are snobs.", "\"I told him about the engagement party and when it was but he never said whether he was planning to come or not which usually means he'll go if I directly ask him to but not because he wants to.\" OP's literal comment.\n\n OP  told him about the party, told him when it was, but he never said he'd be going. How is OP an AH for not pressuring him to clear his busy work schedule to make sister look good? \n\nEither way, OP isn't on trial here for not offering a precise, clear invite to husband, OP is asking if it makes them an AH for going without him and not literally asking him outright to clear his busy work schedule like sister wanted.", "It just says she didn't ask him to clear his schedule, not that she didn't bring up that the event was coming up and her sister would like him there too. She could very well have brought it up, and he said he had a ton of work scheduled, so she just said \"alright\" rather than asking him to clear out his schedule so he could make her sister look good.", "NTA an international flight for a party? That\u2019s a lot to expect", "Was there a cake? NTA", "NTA ....... who expects people to take a trip from London to New York for an engagement party!! Wedding yes!! Consumer mad engagement parties NO!! And I used to run an events company!! \n\nAnd if her future in laws don't like her before she got engaged what hope is there to suddenly change their minds!! \n\nThis reads like a bad 90s film !!", "NTA. Your sister has to learn that if she wants to accommodate her fianc\u00e9s family, that\u2019s fine. But the rest of your family is not responsible for that crap. I feel sorry for her if she is like this already.", "Maybe he's Prince Harry.", "I want to know what\u2019s so great about this husband that his mere presence improves the sister in laws \u201cstatus\u201d. ?", "It's an international flight. I'm sure they talked about her going. The husband probably knew he was invited, people generally extend invites to spouses.", "It's an international flight, I'm sure the husband knew what she was traveling for. And since these types of events usually invites are for the couple, I bet he knew he was invited.", "It comes across like OP's husband is a people pleaser, so if she asks, he'll go because he feels like he's expected to.", "I get that but don\u2019t they live together? Don\u2019t they discuss where they\u2019re going and when?", ">I told him about the engagement party and when it was\n\n\nYes?", "NTA \n\nBut why does she want to marry into that family? Where is her SO? Why are they allowing this?\n\nI don't think sister is TA either, but SO and future in laws are", "NTA. Will a full size cardboard stand up of your husband suffice?", "NTA.  I can't imagine this life.  Geez", "Why is your husband a factor in how they treat her ? \n\nWhy is she using your husband as a prop for her in laws ?", "NTA your sister cannot go through life ordering one group of people to appease another group of  people. If she cannot be accepted just as she is, then she needs to find new people where she is a better fit. She is a jigsaw piece sitting in the wrong box.", "NTA. Your sister is just stupid and her future in laws... No comment.", "Your sister is TA, not you.  Too bad she\u2019s so subservient without a mind of her own.", "NTA\n\n\n\nImagine taking the time and expense to go all the way to NY for an engagement party. How is that not enough for her? And imagine only wanting your brother in law around for his status & not his personality or for being BIL. That family she's marrying into sucks", "NTA maybe she needs to rethink that marriage", "NTA - I'm perplexed as to why your sister is happy to be treated like a piece of sh\\*t. I'm also perplexed as to why she should rely on your husband to show up and make everything ok.\n\nLike, does your husband have to show his face every single time your sister sees her in-laws?\n\nEither way, it's not your problem (even though I'm sure you'll have a lot of drama thrusted upon you going forward), your sister chose this and well...good luck to her.", "I think that OP\u2019s husband is a celebrity, aristocrat or very wealthy. Someone \u201cimpressive\u201d.\n\nOP you and your husband do not need social climbing fake friends. Too bad that your sister has not yet worked out that she does not need them either.\n\nNTA", "That's certainly possible, but then why did they supposedly start treating her nicely after meeting her BIL? And then supposedly revert when he wasn't as close as they thought? That's a weird pattern if it's true - but totally makes sense if they are obsessed with status or money and BIL impressed them. \n\nWe would need a description of the future in-laws behavior to really know.\n\nIt could be that sister and future in-laws both suck, or just sister, or in-laws suck and sister is desperate and acting poorly in this particular situation.", "Or maybe he \u201cjust\u201d has a successful career, like maybe a government job or doctor/lawyer. But OP\u2019s sister should be wary about marrying into this kind of family, this almost certainly isn\u2019t their only major red flag.", "I understand this completely. My partner will go with me to any event if I tell him I would like him to go. But he doesn't necessarily want to go. If your husband was just absolutely dying to fly internationally and put his work on hold, I'm sure he would have said something. He was probably relieved to have been let off the hook. I know my partner would be happy to stay home from an engagement party"]}
