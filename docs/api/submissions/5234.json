You came for your sister. If her future in-laws are only accepting of her because of the status of her associates, they're shallow. This isn't your fault. And where is her future husband in all of this? Is he standing up for her or behaving like a mouse?", "Her standing with her in-laws isn't your responsibility.

Nice of you to show.", "NTA.\n\nThese people are seriously unreasonable, immature and exhausting. \n\nYour sister doesn\u2019t get to decide whether your husband does something so stressful, and she really needs to get a grip and come back to reality.
