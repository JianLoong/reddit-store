That being said, I always loved her and knew she loved me, but she often went easy on my other sisters (34 & 22) who were her blood children, while me and my blood sister often got the short end of the stick. \n\nI guess it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019ve been insecure about my place in this family. \n\nAnyway, the other night I bought my mom a cute little nightgown cause she likes to sleep in them, which sparked a conversation about how stingy/selfish I used to be as a child. I laughed it off and said that sharing everything with a sister only one year younger than you would do that\u2014we shared a room, we wore the same outfits even if I didn\u2019t want to, my mom forced me to take her along to hang out with my friends, made me help her with her homework, etc. \n\nShe hummed and then goes, no\u2014it\u2019s because my genetics.

My birthmother did the same, so I told my Mom that she was no better than me in that case, and that she doesn\u2019t get to judge me over stuff I had no control over if I can\u2019t do the same. \n\nWe drove in silence for the rest of car ride.

How classy\u2026\nI feel like that comment about your adopted mom\u2019s genetics was shitty, but not as shitty as bringing up something so hurtful right after your daughter tried to tell you she cares about you via a gift\u2026? So yeah, you saying a similar comment was not only super warranted, if you let it slide\u2014she\u2019d feel like you agreed with her remarks and that wouldn\u2019t bother her??? As the mother who raised you???\nNTA. Sorry. Moms cant be saying shit like that to their kids. Esp their adopted kids. She needs to snap out of this and apologize.", "NTA yikes.  You may want to talk this out later, but that was super fucked up to say.   You\u2019re selfish and it\u2019s your genetics?  Damn.  She basically called you a bad egg and your fundimental building blocks broken.  Wtf. I don\u2019t blame you for lashing back when you were trapped in a car with her.", "Look, let me see if I got this right: you gave your mom a *gift,* she responded by insulting you and poking at your insecurities and when she didn't drop it, you retaliated in the same manner. I think what you said was harsh but I also think it was frankly a badass move. \n\nI get it, she cried and she's your mom. But you're right; if she's going to judge you for your birth mother, you at least have the right to do the same to her. And she came at *you,* brutally poking at insecurities that it's obvious *she* had a large hand in creating. \n\nShe's not behaving like a proper mom to you and it doesn't sound like she has been for a long time and a hit dog's gotta *eventually* hollar, everyone knows that. What you said was harsh but it was *not* that bad, genuinely, especially considering what she said. If she wants you to be more respectful or not mention her mother, she needs to earn that respect and treat you with it in turn. \n\nNTA.", "Oof!\n\nA well-aimed and well-deserved low blow. Bravo\n\nHopefully, your mum will have learnt that she shouldn't throw shit if she doesn't want to get some thrown back at her. She's also learnt that you are no longer willing to be an easy target.\n\nI wouldn't feel guilty at all\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nAdult adoptee here, who never met her birth parents.  I\u2019m 53. \n\nWhat you said was harsh, but your mom is the one who took the first swing. She can dish it out but can\u2019t take it. She was wrong to demean you and your dignity.", "NTA. You don't deserve to be treated that way. You were adopted as an infant, you mother raised you for your entire life. What your biological mother may or may not have been has zero bearing on YOU!!! You may have ended up with her shape eyes, or crooked fingers. But who you are, your interests, attitude, those are all you. You got your mom a gift and she turned it around, into some pissing contest, and really WHY??? What was her point in that?? That is just petty, poor manners, bad all the way around. It might be a really good idea to go low contact and seek therapy. It really sounds as if you have some unresolved trauma to work through, and nobody can blame you for that. You didn't cause the favoritism or difference in how you and your sibling group was treated.", "Hard NTA. Your mother may love you, but throwing a gift in your face while denigrating who you were as a child and blaming your genetics is hands down disgusting.\n\nThe fact she has a similar background possibly explains the issues here, but none of this is OK. Adopted kids were treated just slightly worse than bio kids, then blamed when they reacted to the unfairness? That is going to give you issues, friend, and it is not your fault.\n\nYou can love your mother and she can love you at the same time as it not being OK how you were treated growing up. Subtle stuff can do a lot of damage! Growing humans need to feel loved and emotionally safe.", "ESH, but you\u2019re less shit. She sounds like a bad mom, but you don\u2019t need to stoop to her level. If she does crap like this often, I think you should probably reduce your contact with her, cause it seems like she does stuff that\u2019s harmful to you, and that makes you be a meaner person.", "You\u2019re kinda both the asshole here. Your mom shouldn\u2019t have said what she did, and you shouldn\u2019t have either. Have a heart to heart about it, communicating is important for situations like this", "ESH\n\nGo talk to her, maybe you showed her she was being awful, but it was very harsh.  Of course, so was she.", "It's a simple quarrel between two family members. Why ask the AITA subreddit?

No. As you described it, she had it coming: It's ok to judge you over stuff your bio mother did, but it's not ok to judge her over the stuff her own bio mother did? That's hypocrisy as it comes, right?\n\nMy mother is a bit like this. My late husband came from an abusive family - as in abusive, his father was an alcoholic, violent person who used to direct his physical abuse on the mother and the sister, never to the (seven) sons he had. His father died when my husband was 12, and he said it was a huge relief for him - he could have friends over and not feel embarrassed of that drunk asshole trying to beat up his mom and sister and to not have to fight him over it. When we got together, he was 26, member of law enforcement and had a good life. My mother was like, ok, but he had this violent father, so he for sure will be like him, and I worry. (Spoiler: He never was. Not for all the 20+ years we were together.) I was so...  furious, enraged, whatever, just because she felt entitled to judge him like that.", "ESH.

You got that from your bio mom not me.\u201d \n\nWe\u2019ve had conversations about how insecure I feel in the family before, especially since my bio mom passed away and resurfaced a whole bunch of resentment I didn\u2019t know I still had. \n\nI think I could have made my point without bringing this pain she\u2019s been harboring, but on the other hand I wonder if it would have even been effective if I didn\u2019t draw on that same exact insecurity she had about her own mother. Idk. The people who\u2019ve replied have given me a lot to think about.", "yeah, thanks for this. That\u2019s basically how I read into it. Chalking up my past behavior to genetics just made me feel weird, like she didn\u2019t really see me as her daughter despite the fact she raised me from 3 days old?? \n\nMy feelings were hurt and I lashed out when she kept pushing because it was like fine, here, this is how you made me feel\u2014but I still feel like garbage for letting my anger get the best of me.", "She\u2019s not a bad mom exactly, she just kinda refuses to see how her actions impact others under the guise of her being \u201cmom\u201d and me being \u201cchild\u201d.

And I really, really get it. I'm nearly 50 years old and I've spent my whole life trying to win my mother's approval because she does stuff like this.\n\nAnd like you, I really love my mum and I know that she loves me. But as you say, her own mother was not always great, and my mum had this weird idea that if she praised us too much we'd become full of ourselves or something? So she'd heap praise on other kids - she was a teacher, and I got used to hearing how brilliant this student of hers or that was, or her friends' kids - but rarely complimented me or my sisters. And it hurt so much, because objectively, my own teachers were constantly pointing out that I was incredibly gifted . . . and the other adults around me were telling her how smart I was. But if I acted proud of myself, she'd be like, \"Of course you're bright, but you're not SPECIAL like so-and-so.\"\n\nWhat my mum and yours did - trying to bring their own daughters \"down a notch\" so to speak, for some unknowable reason - is and was not okay. And I'm sorry that yours is still doing it. You are NTA, and as someone who is younger than your adoptive mum, u/goingouttopunch, but old enough to have birthed and raised you, I want to send you huge virtual hugs and tell you that you were right to tell her she hurt you, and *it's even okay that you said hurtful things back to her*. You didn't do it in a calculated way, you did it in the heat of the moment, reactively. And if you made her cry, well . . . maybe you also made her think. She earned that. This old lady is proud of you.", "> she just kinda refuses to see how her actions impact others under the guise of her being \u201cmom\u201d and me being \u201cchild\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s bad mom behavior, and it contributes to you flying off the handle. You\u2019re putting the work in, and you\u2019re clearly pretty introspective about your own behavior. \n\nI think part of that work is trying to make sure that the ways you interact with your mom aren\u2019t contributing to your anger. Maybe that\u2019s temporary changes while you work on yourself, maybe it\u2019s more permanent changes cause you realize some stuff she does hurts you. I\u2019m just some random dingus on the internet, but having come from similar anger issues that\u2019s how I see the situation.", "You\u2019re pretty wise for a random dingus lol. Thanks for the input, I appreciate it and will be putting it to use in the future.", "Hi, so I have four adult kids around your age (all in their 20s) and from a mom's perspective please let me tell you: the easiest way to undermine my relationships with my kids would be for me to *treat them like children*. It's called infantilizing and it's universally rage-inducing, especially when it comes from your parents.\n\nYou are *not* the small child you were before. You have worked hard (and are still working!) on making changes. It *is* frustrating that your mom still doesn't see and acknowledge that. \n\nI advise you deflect instead of engaging her foolishness. She *has* to pretend all your \"bad\" traits are genetic; if it's not Nature, then it's *her* Nurture that caused issues! But you don't have to take her silly genetic comments seriously.\n\nNTA."]}
