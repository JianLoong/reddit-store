It's a pretty big machine and we have about 8 of them in the class, 3-4 people being assigned to use a certain one throughout the semester.\n\nHere's the main problem, a kid (who I'll call Danny), who shares the same lathe as me will not stop standing right behind me as I work, like I can feel him breathing down my neck. It wasn't a huge problem at first since I thought he was just curious but it's gotten to the point where I can't stand him. He's either right behind me which causes me to bump into him as I try to move tools around, criticizing how I'm working on MY project, or messing around with the lathe while I'm working on it. This all sounds silly, but there were times where we both almost got hurt because of his stupidity. I told him today to \"please move out of the way when I'm working\" but he just nodded and continued to watch over my shoulder. Whenever he's working I always wait far out of the way. Danny also shouts obvious instructions at me like \"You need to move this\" or, \"This needs to be tightened\" like I'm getting there?? Worry about your own stuff.\n\nDanny also follows me around the shop, and listens to my conversations with my friends. Me and a friend were once talking about people walking slow in the halls, and out of nowhere Danny pitched in and said \"Everyone walks at their own pace\". His comment isn't what bothered me, it's the fact that he was watching and listening to our conversation that he wasn't included in.\n\nI really tried being Danny's friend at first, helping him out, and just making general small talk with him sometimes, but at the moment I really can't stand being around him. Curiosity is one thing, but you can be curious without being in my way and fucking around with my stuff.\n\nThe thing is, I'm not a mean person. Like I literally hate being mean to people wether it's in my best interest (like this situation) or not. All while this was happening I've been acting nice to him because I would feel bad if I said or did anything that was rude. This and being bad at confrontation are the reasons why I'm conflicted. I'm also wondering if I'm being dramatic, and maybe he just needs some friends but at the same time I don't think that messing with other peoples work and constantly making comments and giving obvious instructions is a way to make friends.\n\nSo WIBTA if I told this kid to leave me alone?", "created_utc": 1677739868, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fvq6d/wibta_if_i_told_a_kid_in_my_class_to_leave_me/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you have already asked and he has ignored you then it is time to get your teacher involved.

Hope you can resolve this.", "NTA. Obvious social issues out of the way, a lathe can be dangerous and he should absolutely not be standing there. I've seen things fly off of them before and it would be very bad for both of you if he was standing right behind you when it did. \n\nBut it sounds like you already asked him to leave you alone, and it won't. If he doesn't listen, maybe go to the teacher about him standing behind you because this is an obvious safety hazard.", "NTA. You\u2019re in a metal shop. This is a safety concern.", "YWNBTA.\nthat kid just needs to leave you alone and not stalk you", "You would not be the asshole, if you go about it the right way. Sounds like the kid doesn\u2019t understand boundaries, and sadly you\u2019re probably not going to teach him that no matter how hard you try. You Can talk to him, talk a lot when he\u2019s too close stop what you\u2019re doing and quietly (just so others don\u2019t obviously hear you) explain \u201cI can\u2019t work when you\u2019re this close to me it\u2019s dangerous and rude\u201d when you\u2019re being courteous to him Explain why you\u2019re standing so far away, remark that YOU don\u2019t make corrective comments on HIS project. List all the stuff he needs to do, as you do it, and remind him to stop when he does it. As far as him listening in, lower your voice, make sure you\u2019re not close to him so if he try\u2019s to listen in it\u2019s gonna be awkward and hard for him. You won\u2019t have to do it forever just long enough for him to get the hint. Idk man I\u2019ve dealt with people who acted like this w personal space and boundaries, and sometimes it\u2019s like they really can\u2019t help themselves. They\u2019ll keep getting too close (to see everything you\u2019re doing and comment on how right or wrong it is) or trying to hear what you\u2019re talking about (maybe wanting to be a part of your group having something to talk about to others) and my most useful weapon is words, and distance   Good luck and I hope you can get some helpful advice.", "NTA, talk to teachers about this because he's stalking you. You are *underreacting* and you are not being mean.", "NTA... BUT, you might want to check with your teacher if 'Danny' is on an a 504 or IEP plan. Your peer sounds as though he has 'social challenges'. These types of behaviors are frequently signs of autism-spectrum disorder or other specific learning disabilities (SLDs). Since you do not want to be cruel, find out first if he has any special needs.  BTW, the teacher will not confirm or deny that Danny has any special needs, but he will ask you why! This will give you an opportunity to voice your concerns to your teacher - specifically as he is becoming a serious safety risk to himself, you, and others. If he is on a 504 or IEP, and something happens, that is a massive lawsuit waiting to happen.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As other commentators have mentioned it sounds like Danny might be on the autistic spectrum or have some learning issues.
