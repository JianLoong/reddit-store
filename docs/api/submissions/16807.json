They in the area to visit with family, and we were the only ones with a spare bedroom. \n\nNow, I\u2019m the youngest sibling. My two older sisters moved out a while ago, and since they were just taking up space, my parents got rid of a lot of our \u2018kids stuff\u2019. (playdough, legos, action figures, etc) Because of this, any time my mom or aunt needed to entertain her, they\u2019d just sit her in front of the TV and put on whatever cartoon she asked for. Whenever the TV was occupied, Mia would whine loudly about how bored she was, until whoever was using the TV (usually me or my dad) let her put on her cartoons. \n\nWell, last night my dad was watching some show, and Mia got bored and started on with her routine, but my dad wouldn\u2019t budge. Eventually, my mom got so annoyed that she sent Mia up to my room to ask for my Nintendo Switch (that I bought with my own money btw). Unbeknownst to Mia or my mom, I had just gotten out of the shower. \n\nMia didn\u2019t knock, and just opened the door while I was putting on clothes. I\u2019m not sure exactly how much she saw, but suffice it to say she screamed \u201cEWW\u201d and ran away.\n\nWhen I did get dressed and came downstairs, my aunt scolded me for \u2018traumatizing\u2019 Mia. She said that I should have gotten dressed faster (I admit, I did take my time) because I knew there was a young girl in the house. \n\nMy dad is staying out of it, and my mom is refusing to punish me despite the fact that she agrees with my aunt. My aunt, however, is refusing to speak to me or leave me alone with Mia until I apologize, and she\u2019s giving me dirty looks whenever I so much as say hi to Mia. \n\nHer strong reaction, and the fact that my mom agrees with her, has me second guessing myself.

As a parent. Closed doors require respect of a knock and answer before going in. I can see why a kid might be traumatized in the sense of seeing a naked body. I mean i only ever didnt knock once. And lets just say once was all it took. I saw what was never meant to be seen by a mom. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. So now yes. My son responds come in when its safe or not now when hes doing his own thing.", "NTA. Mia is old enough to knock instead of barging in but barged in.

It's perfectly normal for him to not touch that with a 10 ft pole. \n\nNot suggesting there's anything wrong with nudity after a shower, just that it's not a dad friendly topic.\n\nBut really, your cousin needs to knock and not open the door until/unless she's told it's okay to.
