He has one son. The boys other can't stand me. She hates the fact that their father has found someone after 5 Years of being divorced. Anyway, because of that, My stepson Jack and I don't have the best relationship. I am not involved in his life because that's the way he and his mother wants it. He won't speak to me when I try to have a conversation so I just don't even bother anymore. I have offered to do things for him but hid mother always says that she doesn't want \"that woman\" involved. To keep the peace, I stay out. Now Jack and I are both musicians. I play several brass and wind instruments as well as guitar. He has joined band this year as a 9th grader. Naturally, he wants to play jazz guitar. His mother knows I have several instruments and I offered one of the lesser value guitars to him but he and his mother want my 1963 Fender. Absolutely NOT !! For one, he doesn't take care of anything he has and number two, why am I going to loan something that valuable out to someone who does not want to be around me? Sure, the guitar is worth way more but I got a deal on it for 3k. My husband says I am absolutely right for not doing it and he says I shouldn't even offer the old Squire guitar either and it's only 250.00. His mother has been blowing up our phones, calling me every name in the book because I am \" driving a wedge in his and his father's relationship \"? How is that so? She says that I should try and make amends and let him borrow it for the school year. Why am I having to make amends? She even had her friends harass me on Facebook?

Anyway, because of that, My stepson Jack and I don't have the best relationship. I am not involved in his life because that's the way he and his mother wants it. He won't speak to me when I try to have a conversation so I just don't even bother anymore. I have offered to do things for him but hid mother always says that she doesn't want \"that woman\" involved. To keep the peace, I stay out. Now Jack and I are both musicians. I play several brass and wind instruments as well as guitar. He has joined band this year as a 9th grader. Naturally, he wants to play jazz guitar. His mother knows I have several instruments and I offered one of the lesser value guitars to him but he and his mother want my 1963 Fender. Absolutely NOT !! For one, he doesn't take care of anything he has and number two, why am I going to loan something that valuable out to someone who does not want to be around me? Sure, the guitar is worth way more but I got a deal on it for 3k. My husband says I am absolutely right for not doing it and he says I shouldn't even offer the old Squire guitar either and it's only 250.00. His mother has been blowing up our phones, calling me every name in the book because I am \" driving a wedge in his and his father's relationship \"? How is that so? She says that I should try and make amends and let him borrow it for the school year. Why am I having to make amends? She even had her friends harass me on Facebook? She claims I ruined his freshman year for band and I need to make it right\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
