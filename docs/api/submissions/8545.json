To sum things up, he left her with nothing. After 30 years of marriage, things have come out that the family didn\u2019t know. My wife and I are the only ones to believe it, the rest of the family say my MIL is a huge liar. We temporarily had her move in with us, then found her a place of her own. Since the divorce, my wife and I have been financially supporting her. \n\nThe entire ordeal has caused friction with the family. My FIL quickly moved some woman into the house and got engaged apparently. My SIL arrived to the decision she was not going to invite her own mother to her wedding. However, my wife managed to change her sister\u2019s mind. MIL was not to be part of the wedding and did not attend the dinner rehearsal. As things were, my MIL was to sit in the back. FIL and his fling were assigned front row seating along with myself, my wife and the remainder of the family. \n\nAs we were taking our seats, I walked my MIL up front and instructed her to sit next to my wife. I sat in the back during the ceremony. At the reception, my wife pulled her mother in for pictures. My SIL made a scene and said she did not want her mother in that particular picture, but she hadn\u2019t been in any prior to that. Because of the argument, the three of us returned to our seats. The entire wedding was uncomfortably awkward as we all could feel tension and received odd looks from other guests. \n\nThe next day, immediate family only were to have breakfast. There was a change in venue to which none of us were told. We understood that was deliberately done, because we obviously weren\u2019t wanted there. Around noon we began packing up to travel back home. I was taking our luggage down when my SIL approached me and said, \u201cYour wife is a real bitch for what she did.\u201d I asked her to elaborate to which she was directly referring to the seating incident. I corrected her, let her know that was solely my idea and my doing. \n\nShe pretty much snapped at that point and said she never considered pulling a stunt like that at our wedding. She continued on saying how it was her day, she should have been in control of everything but I took that control from her, ruined her pictures, and caused her undue stress. She blamed my wife and I for causing a family division, said this was the final incident that pushed her over the edge. Personally, I thought she was making too much of it and didn\u2019t take into consideration her mom\u2019s feelings of being shoved to the back. \n\nThe following day, my wife\u2019s brother stopped by our house to pickup my tux. He began chastising me, said what I did was an extremely disrespectful move and everyone at the wedding thought we were obnoxiously rude guests. He said I should have left family affairs out of the wedding. All I could say is, oh well. I did it and it\u2019s over with. But literally no one is letting it go and we\u2019ve been seemingly shunned from the family along with my MIL.", "created_utc": 1674938531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nozn6/aita_for_disregarding_prearranged_seating_at_my/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My wife and I seeing how unfair things had become, decided to care for her both financially and offer our support. By us doing that, it caused issues with the family. My MIL was originally not invited to my SIL\u2019s wedding. After a change of mind, she could only attend but not be apart of the wedding. I decided to switch seats with my MIL which put her up front.

Your MIL is not your mother, and this was not your wedding. \n\nThe reason no one is \u201cletting it go \u201c is because you haven\u2019t apologized. You can\u2019t just say \u201coh well it\u2019s done\u201d and expect that you won\u2019t be held accountable. For someone that likes to make decisions for their extended family you sure aren\u2019t acting like a member of a family. Family makes amends and apologizes.", "YTA, if what you say is true and your FIL left your MIL without anything and ostracised her from her family then you were doing her a kindness trying to include her in the events, however, it was your SILs day and it was up to her to decide how she wanted things to play out on her day whether ill informed or not.", "YTA you had no right to force them to include MIL in the way you decided was proper. I get that you feel like you are sticking up for the victim, but do you really think it helped the situation to make a scene like that to get her in the pictures? Even if they took them, it wouldn\u2019t change how they feel. Now the animosity has increased even more.", "YTA I really don't know what the accusations are, and what happened between MIL and FIL, and while I'm confident there's probably more than one asshole in this situation...\n\nYou're still an asshole for pulling this little stunt, especially at a w*edding.* A wedding is literally the last place to intentionally stir up drama. Which is exactly what you were doing.\n\nYou and your MIL aren't helping mend any relationships by doing this. If anything, you're just ensuring that your MIL destroys her relationship with her daughter.", "Your MIL had an opportunity to show her daughter that she would/could respect her boundaries which would rebuild trust and eventually a relationship. Instead you, your wife and MIL blew through the boundaries and took over. YTA", "YTA. You took it upon yourself to complicate a situation repeatedly. Your choice was either participate in the wedding within the parameters that had been agreed to, or choose not to participate at all. You don\u2019t get to renegotiate in the middle of the event, that\u2019s rude, selfish and just assholery behavior.\n\nYou should apologize.", "Yeah, someone else\u2019s wedding is not the place for you to do this. You may be totally in the right in the larger sense. This is still not the place for it.

This wasn't your wedding and you decided to try to create a whole lot of drama to make a point. \n\nIt literally does not matter what went down between MIL and FIL, because it wasn't your place to decide how the day would go. \n\nIf you didn't like the way things were arranged, you had the option to not attend. Your behavior was completely unacceptable, and you've likely damaged relationships with your family permanently.", "YTA \n\nIf mom really cared about her daughter, like you claim. She would not have made a scene.  \n\nShe wouldn't have set down front.  She wouldn't have tried to be in any photos.  \n\nIt would hurt if my children rejected me but I would never ruin their day.  I would sit quietly in the back especially if I wanted to repair. \n\nMom and daughter have a bad relationship right now and you didn't help at all. You made it worse.", "I think YTA. If someone pulled this stunt on me I\u2019d be pissed.

It's your sil's wedding, she can decide who she wants to invite, where they sit, what photos they're in, etc. It isn't anybody's job to mend relationships other than hers and she can do in her own time rather than having it forced apon her at her special day.", "Yes YTA  and I think you and your wife know it. It wasn't your wedding.", "It's a tough situation but YTA.  You don't know what her relationship is with her mom.

Not your wedding, not your choice, not your moment. I would shun you, too.", "YTA\n\nIt seems like you just wanted to cause problems and issues.  Your SIL clearly does not like her or trust her, and should not have had to deal with that extra stress. All you did was reaffirm she should have gone with her gut and left her uninvited.", "YTA.\n\nYou are invited to an event\u2026you should respect the host.\n\nIt\u2019s not your wife\u2019s place to tell your SIL what should do on the day of the wedding.

And that\u2019s if it\u2019s your wife, but you\u2026I don\u2019t see why you think you are entitled to make that decision for your SIL on the day of the wedding without communicating with her first.", "YTA - You stirred the pot at the worst time for your SIL and the rest of the family.

What you did was ultimately disrespectful even though you seem to think you were thoroughly justified", "YTA. Regarless of the family issues, it was her wedding. You don't get to dictate shit. It does not matter what the backstory is. You purposely went against the brides wishes after she conceded and allowed MIL there to begin with, and you all intentionally started shit.\n\nYou would have been FURIOUS if someone did this to your wife on your wedding day. FURIOUS. Had this happened to you, your wife's memory of that day would forever be marred by the intrusion and audacity of a couple guess who decided they got to make decisions about guests and photos. \n\nAll 3 of you should have left after the photo incident. \n\nIt's unfortunate that you felt the need to interfere and ensure the bride will never concede again and allow her mom near her or her family.  The bride will never, ever, forgive her mother for what you and your wife did that day.", "YTA. Your SIL\u2019s relationship with her mother is none of your business, and it was nervy as hell for you to interfere with her wedding like that.", "Soft YTA- it was not the time to force the issue\u2026 SIL already made it clear she didn\u2019t want her mother there but was guilted into doing it by your wife. All your stunt accomplished was make your SIL and family even angrier at her Mother and also you & your wife. It is nice you stood up for your MIL but in the end you made the situation way worse.", "YTA while I agree that MIL is being unfairly treated - this wasn\u2019t your wedding to adjust or attempt to force MIL into.

Regardless of your  settlement and opinions,  it wasn't your decision. Your actions were quite disrespectful and disruptive.", "YTA. What kind of asshole are you to think it\u2019s your place to intervene like that?  It was none of your business. No wonder they didn\u2019t want to have brunch with you. I\u2019d be surprised if they ever deal with you again.", "YTA, with a bit ESH\n\nIt's not your wedding. You made a scene at your SIL's wedding AND let your wife get blamed for it, too.  \n\n\nESH because if MIL was invited to the wedding, then these things needed to be planned with the whole family.", "I'm on the border between NTA and ESH. It's a really hard call for me. But I'm leaning towards ESH. \n\nOn one hand, it was a bad move to disregard your SiL's seating arrangement. It was, after all, her wedding. It caused a lot of drama and made people uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other, your wife's entire family (except MiL) are assholes for how they've treated your MiL. Your FiL is an asshole for cheating and then bringing his latest fling/fiance/whatever to the wedding. Your SiL is an asshole for being on her father's side in all this and not thinking about her own mother, who was blameless in the divorce and screwed over, at all. The rest of your wife's family are assholes for the way they're treating you, your wife,  and your MiL in all this.\n\nAnd quite honestly, while I wouldn't have done it at the wedding, I would have made very clear to them that they are assholes about this and why.", "YTA. I'm sorry. I know you meant well. But it wasn't your place to do this.", "Also where do you live? Because I\u2019m the US there is no place where the wife of 30 years gets left with nothing. Everything is community property", "You are a good person for standing up for your MIL.  But tbh your wife's family dont deserve your MIL or your wife. I guess the three of you should have refused to attend based on the snub and treatment towards your MIL. \n\nYou shouldnt have waited to be shunned, you should have said treating her like this is disgusting and we wont be part of this family. Dont worry about the shunning.  Be there for your wife and MIL and good luck.", "NTA\n\nOP, you're a good guy for honoring your mil. The ick factor of putting the new chick in the front and mom in the back is nauseating. Maybe the bride should have her day. But the bride that does this, imo, is awful.", "NTA. I\u2019m honestly not sure at what point in American culture we adopted this idea that brides are allowed to act like complete *****\u2019s on their wedding day because \u201cit\u2019s their special day\u201d. \n\nWhile as adults there are very few moments that you can expect to be the center of attention, when they do come they are opportunities to show your character. Your sister showed hers, and you showed yours by choosing to respect the woman who birthed you rather than respecting this \u201csisters special day\u201d BS", "I'm going with NTA because you and your wife seem to be the only decent people in this. The rest of her family sounds horrendous. Personally I would go NC with all of them but her mother. What a trashy family.", "YTA.  But a good one.
