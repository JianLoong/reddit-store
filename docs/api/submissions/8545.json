To sum things up, he left her with nothing. After 30 years of marriage, things have come out that the family didn\u2019t know. My wife and I are the only ones to believe it, the rest of the family say my MIL is a huge liar. We temporarily had her move in with us, then found her a place of her own. Since the divorce, my wife and I have been financially supporting her. \n\nThe entire ordeal has caused friction with the family. My FIL quickly moved some woman into the house and got engaged apparently. My SIL arrived to the decision she was not going to invite her own mother to her wedding. However, my wife managed to change her sister\u2019s mind. MIL was not to be part of the wedding and did not attend the dinner rehearsal. As things were, my MIL was to sit in the back. FIL and his fling were assigned front row seating along with myself, my wife and the remainder of the family. \n\nAs we were taking our seats, I walked my MIL up front and instructed her to sit next to my wife. I sat in the back during the ceremony. At the reception, my wife pulled her mother in for pictures. My SIL made a scene and said she did not want her mother in that particular picture, but she hadn\u2019t been in any prior to that. Because of the argument, the three of us returned to our seats. The entire wedding was uncomfortably awkward as we all could feel tension and received odd looks from other guests. \n\nThe next day, immediate family only were to have breakfast. There was a change in venue to which none of us were told. We understood that was deliberately done, because we obviously weren\u2019t wanted there. Around noon we began packing up to travel back home. I was taking our luggage down when my SIL approached me and said, \u201cYour wife is a real bitch for what she did.\u201d I asked her to elaborate to which she was directly referring to the seating incident. I corrected her, let her know that was solely my idea and my doing. \n\nShe pretty much snapped at that point and said she never considered pulling a stunt like that at our wedding. She continued on saying how it was her day, she should have been in control of everything but I took that control from her, ruined her pictures, and caused her undue stress. She blamed my wife and I for causing a family division, said this was the final incident that pushed her over the edge. Personally, I thought she was making too much of it and didn\u2019t take into consideration her mom\u2019s feelings of being shoved to the back. \n\nThe following day, my wife\u2019s brother stopped by our house to pickup my tux. He began chastising me, said what I did was an extremely disrespectful move and everyone at the wedding thought we were obnoxiously rude guests. He said I should have left family affairs out of the wedding. All I could say is, oh well. I did it and it\u2019s over with. But literally no one is letting it go and we\u2019ve been seemingly shunned from the family along with my MIL.", "created_utc": 1674938531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nozn6/aita_for_disregarding_prearranged_seating_at_my/", "score": 395, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My wife and I seeing how unfair things had become, decided to care for her both financially and offer our support. By us doing that, it caused issues with the family. My MIL was originally not invited to my SIL\u2019s wedding. After a change of mind, she could only attend but not be apart of the wedding. I decided to switch seats with my MIL which put her up front.

Your MIL is not your mother, and this was not your wedding. \n\nThe reason no one is \u201cletting it go \u201c is because you haven\u2019t apologized. You can\u2019t just say \u201coh well it\u2019s done\u201d and expect that you won\u2019t be held accountable.

I get that you feel like you are sticking up for the victim, but do you really think it helped the situation to make a scene like that to get her in the pictures? Even if they took them, it wouldn\u2019t change how they feel.

Which is exactly what you were doing.\n\nYou and your MIL aren't helping mend any relationships by doing this. If anything, you're just ensuring that your MIL destroys her relationship with her daughter.", "Your MIL had an opportunity to show her daughter that she would/could respect her boundaries which would rebuild trust and eventually a relationship. Instead you, your wife and MIL blew through the boundaries and took over. YTA", "YTA. You took it upon yourself to complicate a situation repeatedly. Your choice was either participate in the wedding within the parameters that had been agreed to, or choose not to participate at all.

She would not have made a scene.  \n\nShe wouldn't have set down front.  She wouldn't have tried to be in any photos.  \n\nIt would hurt if my children rejected me but I would never ruin their day.

It's a really hard call for me. But I'm leaning towards ESH. \n\nOn one hand, it was a bad move to disregard your SiL's seating arrangement. It was, after all, her wedding.

I guess the three of you should have refused to attend based on the snub and treatment towards your MIL. \n\nYou shouldnt have waited to be shunned, you should have said treating her like this is disgusting and we wont be part of this family. Dont worry about the shunning.  Be there for your wife and MIL and good luck.", "NTA\n\nOP, you're a good guy for honoring your mil.

He's a narcissist, plain and simple.", "Narcissistic abusers can twist everything and convince a judge to do the unthinkable, especially when the victim can't afford a decent lawyer or doesn't know to go through a domestic violence shelter to get legal assistance.", "I agree. Someday sil will be glad her mom was at her wedding. That day won't come until she sees the truth of her narcissistic father, but may never come if she's a narcissist herself.", "All of this. Fil is a classic narcissist.", "It's pretty clear fil is a narcissistic abuser from the details of the story. They are very skilled at getting others to abuse their victims too and skewing the story to make the victim the villain.", "Fil is a narcissistic abuser. Wife is the only child who accepts that truth.", "You are being remarkably vague about what MIL was speaking up about and how she ruined FIL\u2019s reputation. \n\nAlso \u2014 these are not children undergoing parental alienation. These are adults, with opinions formed by a lifetime of knowing MIL and FIL and watching their marriage.", "Stay out of their business.", "Are you referring to the mom in this post?", "Agreed. Certainly sounds like that.", "The relationship her other children choose to have with her is none of your damn business.", "You ruined another person\u2019s wedding bro! This is a day most people plan for months in advance to be drama free and celebrate a couple. What you did was horrible, you and your wife and your MIL. All of you are AHs. \n\nWhat the f is wrong with people like you who decide to pull tasteless stunts like this at other people\u2019s events?! Jfc."]}
