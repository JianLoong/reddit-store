Shopkeeper didn't do the legwork, you did, nothing immoral about that at all.", "NTA would she return some yard sale furniture that turned out to be an antique worth tons of money?", "NTA.

Dealer would have pocketed the proceeds.\n\nDealer is in the business of selling these things and should have known better. OP didn't rip off an orphan. This was an arm's length transaction with a knowledgeable seller.\n\nGood for you, OP, well done! Enjoy your coin!", "If you have a good relationship, and you wanted to build on it, you could offer to return it for like half the value - you profit half, he \"profits\" half - but you're not obligated to do so, and sometimes if you try to do that with someone greedy it can backfire.\n\nJust something to consider, if I was in this situation with someone I considered a friend I'd feel bad about keeping it from them, but as everyone else has said it's your judgement call and you don't have to."]}
