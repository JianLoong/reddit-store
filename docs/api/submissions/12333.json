My husband (27) and I (25) have been together since we were teens. MIL (47) was jealous from the get go of our relationship. I\u2019ve read up a bit on this, it\u2019s to do with her not having their emotional needs met by a partner so they subconsciously use their son to meet those needs. \n\nThen when I fell pregnant with my now 4 yr old, she kept saying \u201cmy baby\u201d and sometimes she would slip and start referring to hubby as our child\u2019s \u201cbrother\u201d. This continued my whole pregnancy and she would boast about it to anyone and everyone. Then when he was born it all amplified. She wanted to take him to spend alone time with him from the time he was a couple weeks old. And would be offended when we said no. She would always say that grandma loves him more than his parents do. She would kick up a giant stink whenever she wasn\u2019t able to take him out alone, She never wanted to spend time with him around us. \n\nthere were so many times where we tried to set boundaries but she would always do it her way and guilt trip us. When we would do things together she would physically push the pram out of my hands and she would push the pram EVERYWHERE anytime we were together \u201cI\u2019ll push my baby\u201d and I was never allowed. she would never correct people if they assumed she was his mother. And as his parents we thought that was too weird. he is always \u201cher grandson\u201d but never ever is he our son. anytime we do anything it is ALWAYS about her. It\u2019s like shes now using my son to meet her emotional needs which even though it\u2019s subconscious, to me it\u2019s SICK! I have tried to place more boundaries but always get met with guilt trips. \n\nwhen we go places together where my son will experience what I call \u201cfirsts\u201d all of those things are taken over by her. Even just small details like going to buy a drink, she NEEDS to take him instead of us. she either takes him and does them without us or I\u2019ll say hey maybe he could do that with his parents too and she will be unhappy and making sure that he holds HER HAND and he\u2019s sitting next to her and not us, she always always makes sure if he comes over to me that she gets his attention back onto her. She constantly constantly tells him she loves him the most, he\u2019s her favourite, he\u2019s her favourite person, and any time we do anything together to make her the centre of his attention. \n\nnow that I\u2019m having another baby (also a boy) I have been worried it\u2019ll be the same thing all over again. But it\u2019s not. I caught her telling my son (don\u2019t worry you will be grandmas favourite always you are grandmas boy you won\u2019t have to share I\u2019ll always be your favourite person) and that is just horrible. She is saying things like \u201cyou and grandma can do things together and mum and dad can have the new baby\u201d. \n\nam I the asshole for thinking that this is just absurd behaviour!?\n\nEDIT- We have had many talks.. me alone with her, him alone with her, us together with her, it always ends with her crying and guilt tripping us\n\nEDIT 2- I understand it now after reading comments, sometimes it hard to look in from the outside when you are stuck on the inside. For a while there I thought taking her away may have been a bad decision because of how much he adores her. In my mind I was taking away someone he cherished. After reading the comments I can now see what it is from the outside looking in, just needed that boost to get there and get out of the box. The guilt I was feeling was mainly because of how he feels towards her, which now I get. How could a 4 year old not cherish someone who gives into his every whim? I get that now that\u2019s actually manipulation but when you stand here and watch them and you watch how his eyes light up when she\u2019s around and how excited he is, it does take a little bit of a shove to look at it from a different angle and have that realisation moment", "created_utc": 1678875093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rs4fg/aita_for_thinking_my_mils_obsession_with_my_son/", "score": 3786, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can\u2019t set a boundary, have her break it, and then not punish her for it. That\u2019s teaching her that she can break all the boundaries you set, and that her emotional manipulation works. Also, your husband should be the one setting the boundaries, it\u2019s his mother so it\u2019s his responsibility. If you don\u2019t stop this now, it will only get worse and your son will suffer the consequences of being emotionally manipulated by her.", "NTA. Your MIL has serious issues. You need to implement firmer boundaries as this is going to (probably already is) effect your elder son\u2019s development and attachment and also your unborn son\u2019s development and attachment. \nYou need to distance yourself from this woman for the sake of your children.", "Stop. Letting. Her. Manipulate. You.\n\nWho cares about the guilt trips. \n\nEnforce your boundaries. She disregards them then she is put in the naughty corner (no contact for a month). Slow introduction, she breaks the boundaries and then back into the naughty corner for longer. \n\nWho cares about what his family say. You are letting them all manipulate you. Tell them she went against your parenting and she is in time out until she can respect that, and that you have no problem putting them in time out too. \n\nShe will be turning her child against you, it\u2019s already happening. For the first few months after baby is born don\u2019t let her come around, she will be turning your child against you and the baby. \n\nNTA \n\nIf possible I\u2019d be moving further away. It will be best for your family if your jobs allow it.", "NTA\nOh wow, that's deeply disturbing. I mean, it's awesome she loves him so much, but she's trying to aggressively force a bond with your child to fill some need. I have children and this would drive me crazy. I would have intervened ages ago. It may be time for your husband and her to have a talk, as this is crossing all the boundaries.", "NTA. My mother did this with my eldest. It only got worse as time went on. Years ago, I found out things were so much worse when she was alone with her. The woman put in a lot of effort convincing my daughter that I didn't love her and that I was wrong about everything. She actively destroyed our relationship, leaving me trying to raise a child who didn't trust or respect me. This wasn't just hard on me; it was detrimental to my daughter. It was also damaging to my middle child, who was treated as, at best, an afterthought. I went NC for years, but the damage was already done. If I could go back in time, I would've cut her off in the beginning.", "NTA, and you need to call a hard stop to this NOW.  Personally, I'd go 100% no contact.  \n\nSo what if she pitches a fit and gives you a guilt trip?  You're the adult.  Deal with her shit so your babies don't have to.", "NTA but being \"met with guilt trips\" is not a reason to allow this behaviour to continue. As your sons parents it is yours and your husbands responsibility to put an end to this.", "Conversation will never fix this problem.  You are left with one choice and that is to not allow her to be in your home or in the presence of your children under any circumstance.  It will be difficult.  But, this is what must happen.  If she shows up unannounced don't let her in.  Be happy.", "Who is more important to you?  Your MIL and her family or your children?  What she is doing isn't just annoying or intrusive.  She is setting your 2nd child up for serious self-esteem issues and abuse by their brother, and she is setting your older child up for a lifetime of behavioral problems that could seriously harm his future.\n\nAnd when your younger child is born and your son feels ignored or neglected (which is inevitable to a certain degree) she will be right there, encouraging resentment and anger towards his little brother and even towards you.    She's already told you that she will with what she has done so far.   \n\nIt doesn't matter what kind of psychological excuses you can make for her behavior, or how much she plays the guilt card.   She is doing active harm, and you have to stop it.   \n\nYou and your husband should consider contacting a therapist yourselves to work through the harm her actions are causing you.  But you need to go NC when the baby is born to allow your family to bond, and if you re-establish contact after some time, as someone else suggested, have actual written rules that you consistently enforce, including continuing therapy, and make sure her enablers are aware as well that you ARE willing to go NC with anybody who cannot accept and follow those rules, or who enable her to violate them.\n\nIt's not a fun position to be in, but you've been put in it and have to manage it for your children's sake.", "NTA if she can't respect boundaries it's time to go LC or NC", "NTA. She sounds absolutely insane. You need to set boundaries and stand by them, even if she guilt trips and \"tattles\" to the rest of the family.\n\nI have seen similar stories over at r/JUSTNOMIL, where the MIL in some cases end up trying to kidnap the kid, or similar craziness. Please be careful it doesn't go that far.", "NTA. Yikes!!!! Definitely time to put your foot down and call bs on the guilt trips. It\u2019s ok to limit time with MIL/ grandma for the sake of both boys and your sanity. She\u2019s already setting the stage for kid#2 to feel less than, disliked, and unequal. And, could also damage the boys\u2019 relationship with each other. You need to let her know that behavior is absolutely unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Time to put grandma in a time out.", "ESH. She for obvious reasons. You for letting her do what she wants just because she knows how to cry on demand.", "And every time she says yes to your son. I would say it is not your place to say yes. You may be his grandmother, but I am his mother, and I set the rules. Say that in front of your son and tell him no and them place him on timeout to think about his behavior. \n\nStop giving this woman any alone time with him. She is messing with your son's mental health.", "I was feeling sorry for you until I read all of your comments.          \nYou are making yourself a victim.        \nYou and your husband need to grow the hell up and stand up to her.       \nStop this, stop her seeing your son, stop having anything to do with her.          \nIf your family come at you SUCK IT UP !!!!!!          \nThe well being of your children is more important than keeping your extended family happy.        \nShe is doing mental and emotional damage to your son and she\u2019ll also hurt the next one when she ignores him.        \nGrow a backbone", "NTA obviously.\n\nI see from your answers to other comments that you're struggling also because she makes the rest of her/your family gang up on you. I get it, \"it takes a village\" and all that. It's hard to cut them off, you probably need them and of course they're family.\n\nBut look, your kids are and will be suffering from this behaviour. You need to protect them. Is there any way you can maybe put physical distance between your immediate family and MIL? A better job offer that you or your husband **have** to take? Any way to diplomatically cut her off with reduced backlash?", "NTA put your foot down on this and HARD, with both her AND your husband. Stop this behavior now before it does serious damage to both your kids and you.", "NTA\n\nAnd you need a family intervention now before you\u2019re fronting the local news because Grandma\u2019s kidnapped your child and is on the run\n\nShe needs to see a psychologist or psychiatrist ASAP because her behaviour is not normal", "I want to say N T A, but you and your husband continue letting her spend time with your son and taking over. You need to go low or no contact. I\u2019m  going to go ESH. Her for obvious reasons. You and husband for not nipping this in the bud", "Ok and I can not stress this enough keep that woman away from your children. Seriously that's some dateline, either you or your child goes missing type shit. That is not ok. I mean this in the nicest way possible and I swear I'm not trying to be disrespectful but one of y'all need to grow a backbone and put an end to this madness. I mean can you imagine her behaving like this when that child gets older? Trying to have friends and experience life and love and find themselves only to have her to use your words guilt trip them into believing she's the only one that really loves them and she's all they need to be happy cuz that's what y'all allowed her to say to them their whole life?", "NTA. Your MIL is wild. Why is she with you all the time? Does your SO try to also set boundaries? Can you move and not tell her where you are? She sounds insanely attached!", "NTA. This is excessive. I know you said you've tried to assert boundaries but it might be time to actively begin limiting contact. Once the baby is born it's fair to expect some family time. My friends actually banned anyone visiting for the first couple of months so they could get used to the change. \n\nI'm curious what your husband thinks? You said he was involved in attempting boundaries before but if you proposed activity limiting her involvement would you both be a united front?", "easy solution stop letting her around your kid until she stops. it should of been nipped in the butt from your post it's been 4 years of this. why did yall let it go on so long that's on you and husband for not putting your feet down.", "NTA. This is really unhealthy on her part. You and your husband may want to look into couple's counseling. **Not because you have problems** but so that you can learn how to present a united front, and additional strategies how to deal with the fallout of your hard boundaries. Therapists are great for helping you figure out situations, and how to take action.\n\nYou also have a bit of a husband problem. This is his mother, and he should be taking the lead on shutting his mother down. It sounds as if he's passively standing by, and he needs to step up even more than you. It's probably harder for him because she \"programmed\" him, but all the more reason for counseling to learn how to stand firm against her.", "Cut her off. Why are you still entertaining this woman and giving into her guilt trips? Her behavior is alienating and unhealthy. Shes trying to replace you as the mother, is trying to destroy your kids relationship with his sibling before it is even born with her \"your parents won't want you anymore when they have a baby\" bullshit.  She has zero entitlement to your child. She is not equal to a parent, is not a third parent,and is just a extended family member like anyone and everyone else (second cousins/great aunts whatever). She doesnt get special treatment unless she earns it by respecting your parenting. Yet she thinks she has some parental authority over you and the baby. You need to put your foot down,when she starts crying,look her in the eye and tell her her guilt trip will not work,then leave. Show her you don't care about her manipulation at all and nothing will work. Your word as parent is law.", "NTA (yet)\n\nYou are risking your childrens well being if you let this continue. \n\n>I caught her telling my son (don\u2019t worry you will be grandmas favourite always you are grandmas boy you won\u2019t have to share I\u2019ll always be your favourite person) and that is just horrible. She is saying things like \u201cyou and grandma can do things together and mum and dad can have the new baby\u201d. \n\nThat is not ok. She is already putting thought of \"Grandma and you against mommy and daddy\" in his head and as soon as your 2nd son is born and inevitable needs more of your time and attention, she will nurture resentment and feelings of abandonment/ beibg replaced in him. These feelings are normal to a degree, but someone actively pushing this is horrible. He will always want his parents, but with grandma in his ear he might start to feel like whatever you do for him isn't genuine and push you away or even start resenring his little brother to the point of harming him.\n\nMake this your hill to die on. You need to protect your children first and foremost.", "Yeah, this woman needs help. NTA", "NTA. This is really weird. Your husband needs to put his foot down and limit contact with her.", "YTA for not putting your foot down and allowing this behavior with MIL to happen over and over.", "NTA - this is not healthy.", "I am going to be kind and say NTA but you and your husband need to stand up to your MIL. This doesn't mean talking to her again, it means banning her from spending ANY time with him until she changes her behaviour significantly, as in \"here's a list of things you can no longer say and do around our son\". What she is doing is harmful to a young impressionable mind. She is going to create a really bad dynamic between your son and his new sibling.   \n\n\nProtect your children and keep her away from them until she changes her ways. If she has a hissy fit, too bad. Your children need to be safe.", "Have you tried recording her doing these things and sending them to the rest of the family just titled a day with MIL. Every time she's around your son do this so no one can say it was a one time thing.  After a couple ask family what they think of the situation. It will be harder for them to make judgment calls against you and your husband if they see it for themselves.", "ESH. \n\n\u201cshe would push the pram EVERYWHERE anytime we were together \u201cI\u2019ll push my baby\u201d and I was never allowed.\u201d\n\nUh, you\u2019re \u201callowed\u201d - and supposed - to make all the parenting decisions for YOUR CHILD. The *second* MIL started pulling this bs should have been the last time she saw your kid if she couldn\u2019t promise to behave.\n\nAny firsts you\u2019ve missed have been because you\u2019ve allowed it. Do you depend on her for money?? I just can\u2019t figure out why not pissing off a crazy woman is more important to you than the well-being of your son.", "ESH. You need to prioritize you and your husband\u2019s family unit over his extended family. When you get married and start a family, your priorities shift towards putting *your own family you create together first*. Grandma is absolutely undermining your marriage and authority as a parent. You & your husband shouldn\u2019t tolerate that. EVER. \n\nNot only that, but Grandma\u2019s emotional manipulation is going to do a number on the 4YO if it hasn\u2019t begun already. If this escalates, it could develop into parental alienation **ESPECIALLY** with the new baby on the way. He\u2019s going to have some big feelings and I can see her twisting that into something like \u201cMommy and Daddy don\u2019t have time for you/don\u2019t love you anymore, but you\u2019re Grandma\u2019s boy, and you\u2019ll always be my favorite\u201d etc. and she could either try to coerce him into living with her, or straight up kidnap him. *72% of all kidnappings in the US are committed by family members.* You might want to look into a restraining order; you mentioned you live about 4.5 hours away, but I doubt that would stop her. Your children\u2019s safety is more important than her \u201chappiness\u201d. \n\nAs the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child, but the village you surround your children with should be a positive influence. If you want this woman in your lives, you need to lay down the law and set strict boundaries with her. The time to do this was years ago, but it\u2019s better late than never at all. If she doesn\u2019t want to respect them, you need to go absolutely no contact and not give a rat\u2019s ass what the rest of the family thinks. Their guilt trips aren\u2019t valid. You don\u2019t need this kind of toxicity in your lives. This isn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d behavior and the kids do not need to see this normalized.", "NTA\n\nGood god grandma, get a grip!", "Weird as shit. Your husband needs to do better about backing you up. NTA", "you\u2019re not the asshole because it is bizarre behavior. however it simply won\u2019t change if you keep letting her get away with it. which you are. and the only solution is to limit contact but you\u2019re not willing to do that so\u2026 you may just have to suck it up :/ and your son will likely have all the issues you already see in your husband. you\u2019re standing aside and allowing trauma and unhealthy attachments to form because you don\u2019t want to cut/limit contact with an extremely toxic family.", "The best part about awful people is when you cut them out of your life.", "Cut her off now before it becomes dangerous for your family. I'd never speak to my mom if she treated my wife or son in this way. Let her cry\n\nNta", "Whew -- get away from that MIL! She is damagingly mentally ill. Set very firm boundaries and don't let her near either of your sons without you there, and take control, and make those visits rare.", "You need to cut her out and accept the backlash from his family, or it's never going to stop. So either accept that this is how it's going to be and your oldest is going to become an absolute terror because he knows your mil will always say yes OR, you nip it in the bud right now and cut all contact off permanently. Yes, even if that means dealing with backlash from your husband's family. Move away and don't tell anyone your new location. If you want to socialize him, there's always daycare and play groups. But it's time to make the hard choices or just deal with it because clearly, nothing else is working. Also, you might want to get your oldest into therapy so that everything your mil has ingrained in his head doesn't do lasting damage.", "Honestly, reading the post I was more than ready to say N-T-A, but reading through your comments, I'm actually leaning more to ESH\n\nYes, your MIL's behaviour IS absurd. More than absurd. It's *creepy*. She is WAY out of line here.\n\nHowever, you are being FAR too much of a pushover. It's not enough just to THINK her behaviour is absurd. You are outright bending over backwards to allow this behaviour.\n\nYou say you've done your research. And yet, while it should be obvious to anyone that your MIL has a Jocasta Complex and is trying to turn your son into her replacement sonsband...you're just letting her? Like, you are just caving in to every demand. That is not healthy or helpful. \n\nYou need to put your big girl pants on and actually stand up to her. If she's going to cry and throw a tantrum and harass, ignore it. Use the grey rock method. Ghost her if you need to. She is a grown woman, not a toddler. If the family turns toxic as well, ignore them too. They aren't attacking you because they agree with her, they're attacking you because they don't want to have to deal with her toxic behaviour either and think just bending over backwards for her is the best way to deal with it (read [this essay](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/) for more details)  You are NEVER going to fix things if you keep showing her that that her tantrums are effective; otherwise she'll keep throwing tantrums until she gets her way. Be firm. Do not fall for the guilt trips. Just show her she is not in charge here. It'll be tough, but eventually she will either learn her place, or she'll learn to stop bothering you as she knows you won't stand for her toxic behaviour", "ESH.\n\nShe's being, as you say, absurd.  \n\nBut your issue is that you're not actually doing anything about it.\n\n> We have had many talks.. me alone with her, him alone with her, us together with her, it always ends with her crying and guilt tripping us\n\nGreat, you've tried talking, and it didn't work.

My husband (27) and I (25) have been together since we were teens. MIL (47) was jealous from the get go of our relationship. I\u2019ve read up a bit on this, it\u2019s to do with her not having their emotional needs met by a partner so they subconsciously use their son to meet those needs. \nThen when I fell pregnant with my now 4 yr old, she kept saying \u201cmy baby\u201d and sometimes she would slip and start referring to hubby as our child\u2019s \u201cbrother\u201d. This continued my whole pregnancy and she would boast about it to anyone and everyone. Then when he was born it all amplified. She wanted to take him to spend alone time with him from the time he was a couple weeks old. And would be offended when we said no. She would always say that grandma loves him more than his parents do. She would kick up a giant stink whenever she wasn\u2019t able to take him out alone, She never wanted to spend time with him around us. there were so many times where we tried to set boundaries but she would always do it her way and guilt trip us. When we would do things together she would physically push the pram out of my hands and she would push the pram EVERYWHERE anytime we were together \u201cI\u2019ll push my baby\u201d and I was never allowed. she would never correct people if they assumed she was his mother. And as his parents we thought that was too weird. he is always \u201cher grandson\u201d but never ever is he our son. anytime we do anything it is ALWAYS about her. It\u2019s like shes now using my son to meet her emotional needs which even though it\u2019s subconscious, to me it\u2019s SICK! I have tried to place more boundaries but always get met with guilt trips. when we go places together where my son will experience what I call \u201cfirsts\u201d all of those things are taken over by her. Even just small details like going to buy a drink, she NEEDS to take him instead of us. she either takes him and does them without us or I\u2019ll say hey maybe he could do that with his parents too and she will be unhappy and making sure that he holds HER HAND and he\u2019s sitting next to her and not us, she always always makes sure if he comes over to me that she gets his attention back onto her. She constantly constantly tells him she loves him the most, he\u2019s her favourite, he\u2019s her favourite person, and any time we do anything together to make her the centre of his attention. now that I\u2019m having another baby (also a boy) I have been worried it\u2019ll be the same thing all over again. But it\u2019s not. I caught her telling my son (don\u2019t worry you will be grandmas favourite always you are grandmas boy you won\u2019t have to share I\u2019ll always be your favourite person) and that is just horrible. She is saying things like \u201cyou and grandma can do things together and mum and dad can have the new baby\u201d. am I the asshole for thinking that this is just absurd behaviour!?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Fast forward to when he was born she was so angry the things she did are just plain terrifying. She'd put him in his play pin under the wobbly ceiling fan & turn it on high in hopes it would fall on him, luckily minutes prior before the ceiling fan ended up falling on the play pin his dad had walked in & picked him up. She'd constantly bully him saying things like \"you're a bastard, he's not your daddy, nobody loves you , you're going to burn in hell \" he was barely old enough to talk. She'd buy the older brother brand new clothes, Shoes, nicer phones. She gave him anything he asked for & second child got scraps whatever older child didn't want anymore up until he was old enough to work & buy his own things. As he got older he started to pointed out the way he was treated told & the things she was doing she'd call the cops & kick him out with nowhere to go.

On the second child's birthday the oldest child would get upset because he wasnt getting any presents, despite it not being his birthday, so she would give him double whatever the amount of money the youngest child got. On Christmas she would hide a bunch of gifts in her room for the older brother to open in secret so no one knew exactly how much more she did for him & all of this still goes on to this day. The older & younger brother don't even speak to each other & if they ever happen to be in the same room it's an all out fist fight. The youngest son has nothing to do with any of his family including his parents because everyone sat idly by & just allowed her to behave this way.
