I just bought lobsters for $8.99/lb this weekend.\n\nIt would seem a lot of people have never experienced a pay-to-play dinner. I've never seen anyone turn down a chance for a cheap lobster, and if you're paying $30/lb, but only charging them $20 total, you're still paying for likely $20 of each lobster or more, and they are getting a hell of a deal, especially if the lobsters are closer to 2 lbs.

If you could not afford to feed them, the invitation should not have been extended and the party should never been announced to your friend group on the group chat. You should have kept the clambake invitation restricted to your family--those that you were planning to pay for lobsters for--and had your friends over for barbecue with hotdogs, etc on another occasion.", "YTA.
