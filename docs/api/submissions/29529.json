He just wanted me to be amazing. \n\nBut to me, a preteen with a still developing brain, horrible emotional regulation and a body coursing with hormones, all it did was point out that no matter how hard I tried and successful I was, he would focus on the places I \"failed\" or wasn't good enough in. That I hadn't reached perfection, so I wasn't good enough. \n\nWhen your daughter is showing you an amazing report card, the only appropriate response as a father is to praise her hard work and diligence. If you have a concern about something, you address it later or not at all, because she is clearly working hard and excelling at what she does. \n\nOtherwise she might develop a complex where she believes no matter how hard she works she will never be good enough, because no one, literally no one, is perfect.", "what world do you live in that it's ok to tell a kid who got a 94 that they can still do better?? this is how the world ends up with kids thinking everything has to be perfect", "If the kid is breezing through and getting at worst a 94, the answer isn't to say 'Why didn't you get a higher grade', the answer is to give the kid something harder that actually challenges them.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It also makes me really defensive because I don\u2019t want to feel like that.", "I had a very similar experience. While I was in school, my dad would make me study during the holidays even though my grades were ok in my opinion. He'd shout at me until I was in tears. Come university, I had such a fear of failing I barely managed to do simple tasks and just about scraped by in most subjects. All of it severely damaged my psyche to a point I needed therapy to learn to deal with the anxiety it caused me.", "He didnt see shit.

Not sure telling your child that a 93 isn\u2019t good enough is a good self esteem builder.

I would expect some amount of paraphrasing of anything someone is advised to say from Reddit, so I don't expect that \"your father is being ridiculous\" would be said verbatim.\n\nBut yes, if the husband isn't willing to tell his daughter that he was wrong to have criticized her, OP should absolutely tell her that the criticism was unfair and she should be proud of what she's accomplished.", "The whole \u201cunified parental front\u201d line, especially when one parent is horribly out of line like this is an outdated and dangerous practice.\n\nIf you can\u2019t disagree calmly on something like adults in front of your children, or if one parent can\u2019t call out another\u2019s mistake in front of the children, something is wrong and that is not healthy - not for the parents or for the parent/child relationship).\n\nOp could have said \u201cHey, I agree we can always try to do better (even when we\u2019re doing great), but I think we have to admit that this is a good grade and we\u2019re proud of her and all the effort she puts in to make and maintain all of these good grades\u201d\n\nEverybody is wrong sometimes, teaching your child that it\u2019s okay to be wrong and demonstrating how to own it is a far better life lesson than OP\u2019s husband was trying to dictate.", "If my husband says something hurtful to one of the kids I will absolutely talk to the kid about it later and explain that he wasn't trying to make them feel bad he was trying to make them do better.

He will also apologize but isn't one for a big talk about it.", "So what's your solution if the husband refuses to change his approach?", "Why should the kid get punished with harder work when they're doing great?
