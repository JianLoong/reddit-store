I love her unconditionally and I know she feels the same way about me. \nRecently, I broke up with my boyfriend of two years. It was a difficult breakup, but amicable. Not sure if it matters, but my best friend has never been in a relationship. Anyways, she really wanted us to go out after my breakup. I put it off for awhile saying I wasn\u2019t feeling it, but she was pretty convincing lol. Said I needed to forget about ex, I could do so much better, etc. Finally I said hell yes you know what\u2019s best, let\u2019s go out. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: the relationship I got out of was not a good one. I gained 30 lbs during it (for various emotional reasons) am currently the heaviest I\u2019ve ever been; trying to feel as confident as possible but im not doing great. \n\nAnyways, we get ready together (super fun), we go out to one of our fav bars (from before controlling ex got involved), she buys me a drink, hugs me, it was a good time etc. Then we met this group of older tech bros, prob late 30s early 40s and she was super into it and I was uncomfortable. They looked so old lol, I wasn\u2019t feeling it. But tbh she was throwing herself at them. I made casual conversation with the one guy who was married and ignored what she was doing until she tapped me on the back and said \u201cwe\u2019re leaving.\u201d I was like \u201coh ok I\u2019ll get ready\u201d and she goes \u201coh\u2026you\u2019re coming?\u201d Turns out she meant her and two of the guys were leaving. She said \u201cyou can have someone pick you up right?\u201d So I just said yes. After that I sat in the corner of the room watching some old dudes play pool, coudnt get an Uber, so I asked my dad to come get me. He did it, but was furious and berated me for going out the whole ride home. Didn\u2019t feel like telling him the whole story, so whatever. \n\nTLDR: BFF invited me out after a breakup and abandoned me for some guys she met.\nI really feel like the AH for making way too much of this, but am I?", "created_utc": 1690965784, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g3bdn/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_friend_because_she_left/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I walked to my car on the complete other side of the plaza (probably half a mile) alone at night. In hindsight, probably not a good idea. I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s now and never forgot it.

You talk about the lack of experience your friend has with relationships and thus breakups, so for her abandoning you at the bar to be a massive social faux pas you'd needed to have impressed upon her your need for support and her being there with you to do this. Her perspective could be that shes already done you the friend solid in managing to get you out of the house and she owes nothing more to you. I would advise if youre still feeling low and recovering from break up let her know the conditions for you going out \" I would need hand holding if we went out I don't really feel up to it without frequent emotional support\" something along these lines so she understands your needs, assuming she should understand them then being affected when she does things that suggest she doesn't understand isn't great.

I feel that\u2019s what most people go to the bar for anyways. She seems like a good friend and she started with good intentions, but she\u2019s an asshole for the way she left.

Maybe its just how I view friendships but if you ask someone out to get over a breakup the point is to helo them get over the break up. If she was that into the guy and there was no reason she couldn't have gotten the guys number and met him (or them?) at a later date. Regardless you don't leave a friend alone in a bar anyway, let alone when she was supposed to be there for you and I would definitely be questioning that friendship imo.", "Wow NTA and that person is NOT your friend.", "NTA.\n\nShe is not your friend.", "Leaving you alone in a bar was not nice. She could trop you home first or wait with you for a taxi/ uber. You should talk to her  and tell her that if she does that again you are not going out with her anymore.", "NTA. DTMFA. Dump the mf already!", "NTA\n\n As someone who was in her 20's in a big city (like 10 years ago) and has been abandoned for dudes at the club and vice versa, these friends are very selfish people especially in the young 20's. \n\n That doesn't mean that theyre bad people. They are just young and any restrictions you all had are now gone so some girls don't take other peoples feelings into consideration especially when alcohol comes to play because their main priority is their priority. Not all women your age are like this though so make sure you go with someone you trust.\n\n Words of advice (from experience) for a newly single woman in her young 20's: always have a plan b for a way to get home (because you never know), carry protection, always cover the top of your cup with your hand leaving the straw in between your fingers(because creeps are everywhere), AND YOU GO TOGETHER, YOU LEAVE TOGETHER!!! It's an unwritten rule with females! \n\n\nWhen you approach her about it, stay cool, calm and collected. Keep emotion out of it. Explain how it made you feel when you were left alone. It's going to go either way. \n\nIf she's apologetic, then all is well and keep your eye open with the next outing you do and definitely have a plan b prepared!\n\nIf she says you're being dramatic or making it a bigger deal than what it was (being argumentative) then you know she's being a selfish friend and does not have your best interest at heart. \n\nYou sound like someone who cares deeply for her friends, you WILL find more friends! You're young and your social scene JUST started! Enjoy every moment and have a lemon drop for me! \n\nAnd also, congratulations for your strength on leaving that loser! \ud83e\udd73 You got this boo!", "NAH\n\nObviously, you were both going to leave the bar at some point. Whether she was headed home or going home with a guy, it doesn't sound like she cut the night short. That's when you leave too. You are an adult and can navigate your way back home. What super powers does your friend possess that would enable her to call a cab or summon a ride share where you could not?", "NTA\n\nYour friend is extremly selfish. She wanted to go out so SHE could have fun, doesn't caring about you at all :( \n\nIn a good friendship, your friend always comes before some random hook ups. Your friend is maybe your best, but definitly not a good friend.", "NTA. There are rules when you go out with girlfriends, make sure everyone is safe. She left you alone, girls' night out rule was definitely broken.", "NTA. She insisted you go out and she ditched you and was even a dick about it \"oh... you're coming?\" She's the major asshole and if you can tell her off, do it", "NTA", "Going out to cheer up your friend? Great!\n\nThen leaving my friend - who isn't in a good state - alone at the bar? Absoluteley no, under no conditions! That's a f... up move!\n\nYou are NTA, but your friend is.", "NTA. If you go out with someone / people, stick together! It was a rule me and my friends had when we would go clubbing.", "NTA.  When you go out, make sure you have a ride, even if someone else is driving.  Ask her why she ditched you and tell her you couldn't even get an Uber that evening and let her know how all that made you feel, especially since she talked you into even going out.  Just don't trust her for a ride in the future.", "NTA - She invited YOU out specifically to cheer YOU up and have a good time TOGETHER. So her ditching you abruptly without even asking if you were good was a horrid move. I suspect she may have misunderstood your conversing with the married man (and also maybe missed the whole married part) and thought you were doing your own thing too, but even still. Not a great move.\n\nI disagree with other comments saying she's an overall bad friend, I don't think we can judge her entire character and the entirety of your friendship from this extremely tiny snippet. But do ensure this doesn't become a trend, and have a conversation about how it made you feel. (Maybe without the \"throwing herself at old dudes\" part though, a little harsh)", "NTA...\n\nYou found out that you can't count on your friend and your Dad is a jackass.  Parents, never berate your young adults because they did the responsible thing by calling you.", "nta, your friend is an A hole for making the night seem about you only to fulfill her selfish desires. also, i\u2019d tell your dad the whole story because he\u2019s the a A hole here too. imagine getting mad at someone for being responsible", "Have you talked to her about this?", "Ok really?\nFirst, you're not ta, but you seem to be completely surrounded by them. \nFirst, your dad berated you? For going out? He's TA.\nYour supposed best friend ditched you for two guys? Yeah she's definitely TA.\nAnd her and the other guys were cool leaving a young, single girl all alone, at a bar, with no way to get home? What about your safety?? \nYour dad should be thrilled you called him, instead of asking some random bar guy to drive you home. Or WORSE. Your bf should be ashamed of herself for leaving you like that. \nPerhaps the reason you were in such a horrible relationship is because that is really all you know. Your bf treats you like crap, your dad is more worried about having to pick you up rather than your safety. I get you have been friends since you were 5, but sweetheart, people change. Maybe you should start taking care of yourself first.\nThis really pisses me off, I just want to hug you. \nGirl, keep your head, heels, and your standards high. That includes girl friends.", "That was a shitty thing of your \"friend\" to do.  I seriously couldn't be arsed with someone who treated me like that.  NTA.", "NTA.

Seriously I don't know anyone who is this dumb \ud83d\ude13", "Even if there wasn't a breakup involved its a dick move to just leave your friend alone in a bar when you two where there together.", "Just cos she's a little judgey about her friends actions doesn't make her an AH for her friend leaving her aline in a bar and not even making sure she had a ride coming. That can be so dangerous, especially if someone is already in a vulnerable place.", "Correct that\u2019s a better statement", "Completely disagree. What if they both found guys they were into and wanted to go home with, they have to both stay at the bar together for no reason because it would be a dick move to leave? Obviously there are dozens more factors, this reductive rule of thumb only serves to leave you acting like TA.", "Chicks before dicks.\n\nYou wanna go home with strange guys then we ain\u2019t having girls night", "Then express that before going out, if you have this mentality and expect other people to mind read it out of you, you are the asshole.", "Pretty sure you're a dude and know nothing about a girls' night out. Not hooking up with men during that is the norm, not the exception. And most certainly not the goal.", "You're justifying them having to mind read you when you could avoid the problem all together.", "Hah, that very much depends on location/country/culture, it's certainly not the case in the European country I'm from...

NAH", "Y T A for the \"they looked so old\" comment.  I say this as someone in his 50s.  lol\n\nBut really, NTA.  It was a night out to console you for your recent breakup and she bailed.  I'd be upset in your shoes as well.  \n\nThe call you have to make is whether she genuinely wanted to comfort you and got caught up in the situation (which is probably forgivable) or was using you because she wanted to go out (less forgivable).  From what you've said, I think the former, but that's your call.", "Sorry to say but you're now going through 2 break ups. NTA", "NTA\n\nThat is a big no-no when you go out with friends. I'm 33 now. I have been going out since I was 18 years old and me and my friends have never once done that and I have a few different friend groups that I take in turns going out with and never in a million years. Would we ever do that.\n\nYou go out together. You stick together. She is not a friend and she put herself and you in potential danger You never leave a friend alone in a nightclub. People are getting spiked by injections now you need to cut that off because she is not a friend.", "NTA. She sounds immature and selfish. One day she'll realize the best, most sustainable relationships are the non romantic nurturing ones you can have with close friends.", "NTA. You have every right to be upset about this . This wasn't okay . If something had happened to you then what ? \nMay I add that your father is an AH too in this situation. If it was my kid I would have been mad at her friend for leaving her and not berating my child who's now an adult. For going out. & move on with their life.\n I hope that you get to a place where you can heal enough to be able to identify good supportive people to have around you. \ud83d\udc93", "NTA never go out with her again.

WTF is up with yelling at you for going out?  He knows you're an adult, right?", "I don't know how often your friend gets attention from guys, the chance to be with them, but if it's very rare, consider that this might be a big thing for her.\n\nSaid as a guy who had many years of not getting anywhere with women.", "Wow, what a dog move.
