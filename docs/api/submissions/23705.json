Not sure if it matters, but my best friend has never been in a relationship. Anyways, she really wanted us to go out after my breakup.

Said I needed to forget about ex, I could do so much better, etc. Finally I said hell yes you know what\u2019s best, let\u2019s go out. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: the relationship I got out of was not a good one. I gained 30 lbs during it (for various emotional reasons) am currently the heaviest I\u2019ve ever been; trying to feel as confident as possible but im not doing great. \n\nAnyways, we get ready together (super fun), we go out to one of our fav bars (from before controlling ex got involved), she buys me a drink, hugs me, it was a good time etc. Then we met this group of older tech bros, prob late 30s early 40s and she was super into it and I was uncomfortable. They looked so old lol, I wasn\u2019t feeling it. But tbh she was throwing herself at them.

I would advise if youre still feeling low and recovering from break up let her know the conditions for you going out \" I would need hand holding if we went out I don't really feel up to it without frequent emotional support\" something along these lines so she understands your needs, assuming she should understand them then being affected when she does things that suggest she doesn't understand isn't great.

Maybe its just how I view friendships but if you ask someone out to get over a breakup the point is to helo them get over the break up. If she was that into the guy and there was no reason she couldn't have gotten the guys number and met him (or them?) at a later date. Regardless you don't leave a friend alone in a bar anyway, let alone when she was supposed to be there for you and I would definitely be questioning that friendship imo.", "Wow NTA and that person is NOT your friend.", "NTA.\n\nShe is not your friend.", "Leaving you alone in a bar was not nice. She could trop you home first or wait with you for a taxi/ uber. You should talk to her  and tell her that if she does that again you are not going out with her anymore.", "NTA. DTMFA. Dump the mf already!", "NTA\n\n As someone who was in her 20's in a big city (like 10 years ago) and has been abandoned for dudes at the club and vice versa, these friends are very selfish people especially in the young 20's. \n\n That doesn't mean that theyre bad people. They are just young and any restrictions you all had are now gone so some girls don't take other peoples feelings into consideration especially when alcohol comes to play because their main priority is their priority. Not all women your age are like this though so make sure you go with someone you trust.\n\n Words of advice (from experience) for a newly single woman in her young 20's: always have a plan b for a way to get home (because you never know), carry protection, always cover the top of your cup with your hand leaving the straw in between your fingers(because creeps are everywhere), AND YOU GO TOGETHER, YOU LEAVE TOGETHER!!! It's an unwritten rule with females! \n\n\nWhen you approach her about it, stay cool, calm and collected. Keep emotion out of it. Explain how it made you feel when you were left alone. It's going to go either way. \n\nIf she's apologetic, then all is well and keep your eye open with the next outing you do and definitely have a plan b prepared!\n\nIf she says you're being dramatic or making it a bigger deal than what it was (being argumentative) then you know she's being a selfish friend and does not have your best interest at heart. \n\nYou sound like someone who cares deeply for her friends, you WILL find more friends! You're young and your social scene JUST started! Enjoy every moment and have a lemon drop for me! \n\nAnd also, congratulations for your strength on leaving that loser! \ud83e\udd73 You got this boo!", "NAH\n\nObviously, you were both going to leave the bar at some point. Whether she was headed home or going home with a guy, it doesn't sound like she cut the night short. That's when you leave too. You are an adult and can navigate your way back home. What super powers does your friend possess that would enable her to call a cab or summon a ride share where you could not?", "NTA\n\nYour friend is extremly selfish. She wanted to go out so SHE could have fun, doesn't caring about you at all :( \n\nIn a good friendship, your friend always comes before some random hook ups. Your friend is maybe your best, but definitly not a good friend.", "NTA. There are rules when you go out with girlfriends, make sure everyone is safe. She left you alone, girls' night out rule was definitely broken.", "NTA. She insisted you go out and she ditched you and was even a dick about it \"oh... you're coming?\" She's the major asshole and if you can tell her off, do it", "NTA", "Going out to cheer up your friend? Great!\n\nThen leaving my friend - who isn't in a good state - alone at the bar? Absoluteley no, under no conditions! That's a f... up move!\n\nYou are NTA, but your friend is.", "NTA. If you go out with someone / people, stick together! It was a rule me and my friends had when we would go clubbing.", "NTA.  When you go out, make sure you have a ride, even if someone else is driving.  Ask her why she ditched you and tell her you couldn't even get an Uber that evening and let her know how all that made you feel, especially since she talked you into even going out.  Just don't trust her for a ride in the future.", "NTA - She invited YOU out specifically to cheer YOU up and have a good time TOGETHER. So her ditching you abruptly without even asking if you were good was a horrid move. I suspect she may have misunderstood your conversing with the married man (and also maybe missed the whole married part) and thought you were doing your own thing too, but even still. Not a great move.\n\nI disagree with other comments saying she's an overall bad friend, I don't think we can judge her entire character and the entirety of your friendship from this extremely tiny snippet. But do ensure this doesn't become a trend, and have a conversation about how it made you feel. (Maybe without the \"throwing herself at old dudes\" part though, a little harsh)", "NTA...\n\nYou found out that you can't count on your friend and your Dad is a jackass.  Parents, never berate your young adults because they did the responsible thing by calling you.", "nta, your friend is an A hole for making the night seem about you only to fulfill her selfish desires. also, i\u2019d tell your dad the whole story because he\u2019s the a A hole here too. imagine getting mad at someone for being responsible", "Have you talked to her about this?", "Ok really?\nFirst, you're not ta, but you seem to be completely surrounded by them. \nFirst, your dad berated you? For going out? He's TA.\nYour supposed best friend ditched you for two guys? Yeah she's definitely TA.\nAnd her and the other guys were cool leaving a young, single girl all alone, at a bar, with no way to get home? What about your safety?? \nYour dad should be thrilled you called him, instead of asking some random bar guy to drive you home. Or WORSE. Your bf should be ashamed of herself for leaving you like that. \nPerhaps the reason you were in such a horrible relationship is because that is really all you know. Your bf treats you like crap, your dad is more worried about having to pick you up rather than your safety. I get you have been friends since you were 5, but sweetheart, people change. Maybe you should start taking care of yourself first.\nThis really pisses me off, I just want to hug you. \nGirl, keep your head, heels, and your standards high.

Seriously I don't know anyone who is this dumb \ud83d\ude13", "Even if there wasn't a breakup involved its a dick move to just leave your friend alone in a bar when you two where there together.", "Just cos she's a little judgey about her friends actions doesn't make her an AH for her friend leaving her aline in a bar and not even making sure she had a ride coming. That can be so dangerous, especially if someone is already in a vulnerable place.", "Correct that\u2019s a better statement", "Completely disagree. What if they both found guys they were into and wanted to go home with, they have to both stay at the bar together for no reason because it would be a dick move to leave? Obviously there are dozens more factors, this reductive rule of thumb only serves to leave you acting like TA.", "Chicks before dicks.\n\nYou wanna go home with strange guys then we ain\u2019t having girls night", "Then express that before going out, if you have this mentality and expect other people to mind read it out of you, you are the asshole.", "Pretty sure you're a dude and know nothing about a girls' night out. Not hooking up with men during that is the norm, not the exception. And most certainly not the goal.", "You're justifying them having to mind read you when you could avoid the problem all together.", "Hah, that very much depends on location/country/culture, it's certainly not the case in the European country I'm from...

I'd be upset in your shoes as well.  \n\nThe call you have to make is whether she genuinely wanted to comfort you and got caught up in the situation (which is probably forgivable) or was using you because she wanted to go out (less forgivable).  From what you've said, I think the former, but that's your call.", "Sorry to say but you're now going through 2 break ups. NTA", "NTA\n\nThat is a big no-no when you go out with friends. I'm 33 now. I have been going out since I was 18 years old and me and my friends have never once done that and I have a few different friend groups that I take in turns going out with and never in a million years. Would we ever do that.\n\nYou go out together. You stick together. She is not a friend and she put herself and you in potential danger You never leave a friend alone in a nightclub. People are getting spiked by injections now you need to cut that off because she is not a friend.", "NTA. She sounds immature and selfish. One day she'll realize the best, most sustainable relationships are the non romantic nurturing ones you can have with close friends.", "NTA. You have every right to be upset about this . This wasn't okay . If something had happened to you then what ? \nMay I add that your father is an AH too in this situation. If it was my kid I would have been mad at her friend for leaving her and not berating my child who's now an adult. For going out. & move on with their life.\n I hope that you get to a place where you can heal enough to be able to identify good supportive people to have around you. \ud83d\udc93", "NTA never go out with her again.

WTF is up with yelling at you for going out?  He knows you're an adult, right?", "I don't know how often your friend gets attention from guys, the chance to be with them, but if it's very rare, consider that this might be a big thing for her.\n\nSaid as a guy who had many years of not getting anywhere with women.", "Wow, what a dog move.

Like he would love if this country went back to prohibition lol. I think that\u2019s the root of him being upset, he just wishes everyone in his life would be sober like him (not realistic but the guy can dream I guess)", "They didn't go to the bar for that though. They went specifically to spend quality time *together*. Not chasing mediocre pipe.", "Not if you\u2019ve lived with parents like that", "NTA - That was a crap thing for your friend to do, obviously. You didn\u2019t deserve that.\n\nI\u2019m worried about something else though, especially if you have younger siblings. That was a very BAD dad move, to get angry picking you up from a bar. That was terrible. Would he have preferred you\u2019d gotten into a car and drove after drinking? And after him acting that way, would you want to call him ever again for a ride, or maybe chance a ride with the \u201cweird stranger\u201d you just met?\n\nYou might want to talk to him about this, especially if you have the younger siblings who will eventually be drinking age themselves, and may need a ride. The Dad ride always needs to be there without anger or judgement, because it is the SAFE ride. If he can\u2019t step up for it, maybe your mom can. Because it\u2019s these little things, not wanting to \u201cpiss Dad off again\u201d that can lead to some catastrophic chances and choices.", "NAH.  You did nothing wrong but neither did she. \n\nYou\u2019re both adults, and if she felt like she wanted to leave with some guy, she should.   After all, that\u2019s why people go out.  Maybe she found the love of her life (unlikely but who knows). \n\nI guess the only reason she\u2019d be the AH would be if she promised you a ride and failed to follow through on that promise.  But you specifically told her you could find a ride home.  Sounds like that was a mistake, but your mistake, not hers.  Assuming you could find an Uber is a very reasonable assumption.", "NTA - She abandoned your friendship by ditching you. It's time to oblige her and move on and find better people to surround yourself. As for your Dad, he's an asshole too. He got mad at the wrong one.

Now, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AS but I don\u2019t think she is either. Maybe talk to her abt it. As someone who goes out often, if one of us meets someone and wants to leave with them, we\u2019ll ask the others if they\u2019re ok and if they are we\u2019ll go. However if someone isn\u2019t comfortable we\u2019ll be honest and then the person won\u2019t go. She asked you if you were ok you said yes, sometimes it\u2019s not deeper than that", "NTA.

This once happened to me. But we were at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. While we were both drunk, she was the one who wanted to go off. I refused to let her because this was before Uber or Lyft existed, and I wasn't about to let her go off in a strange city during a city-wide party with strangers just to get laid. She was pretty mad at me, till she sobered up the next day when she realized how bad it could have been.", "Yeah I know it\u2019s not great, but I think I neglected to say in my post how drunk we both were. I was drunk but she was pretty wasted. She\u2019s like a different person when she drinks that much. The more comments I read the more I think it would be beneficial for me to talk to her about her drinking rather than this incident. Tbh I don\u2019t even care that much now about what happened, I just want her to be safe. She doesn\u2019t have a dad who will pick her up, not by a long shot.", "I always told my kids to call if the are unable to drive home or if they are stuck somewhere and felt uncomfortable with what their friends were doing or felt unsafe. I would much rather be inconvenienced in the moment than to need to go to the morgue to identify my child or for them to get arrested(DIU, accident or killing someone while driving under the influence) or for our daughter to be sexually assaulted.\n\nThey are adults now, and I would gladly do the same for them now as well. Luckily, they are both homebodies and if they drink they do it at home, neither drink often at all though. Our son has actually has done the same for us once because I refused to ride on a motorcycle after we drank more than a few beers.", "Lol sorry, I think I said that bc it\u2019s really unusual for her to want to talk to people outside of our age group and it kinda weirded me out bc it\u2019s not for me", "Thanks. I\u2019m not gonna dump her like a lot of comments say, it\u2019s just not that simple for me. I can definitely tell she\u2019s been in a rough place lately , and tbh I don\u2019t know what me confronting her would do to her. I\u2019m kind of her only close friend rn", "She\u2019s quite spontaneous. And quite self destructive when she\u2019s drunk. Every time we\u2019re out I try so hard to keep her with me but she gets too drunk and insists on finding guys or going to an even crazier bar. Always wants to up the ante, which is fine but i wish she would understand that I\u2019m a more low key person and don\u2019t want to get super crazy all the time", "Oddly enough, it\u2019s not rare at all. She is always the most beautiful girl in the room and gets so much attention. Another reason I thought it was odd to go after this group of \u201colder\u201d dudes when she could have her pick of anyone in the bar", "I\u2019m an only child lol. I\u2019m precious goods to my parents, they wish I would never go out bc they think I\u2019m putting myself in danger, which like, yeah. If it was up to them they would keep me in a plastic bubble. I\u2019d be a bubble girl, stuck playing trivial pursuit with my weird bubble arms", "You're jumping to conclusions.  Dad isn't an asshole just because he berated her.  He did the right thing and came to pick her up.", "My dad totally would\u2019ve yelled at me if I had asked him to pick me up late at night.", "I totally get people have their dislikes. But he should be counting his lucky stars you called him. And berate you- this worries me, because the next time you find yourself in a bit of trouble, I don't want you to think twice about calling your dad. And side note: (and if you remember one thing from any of this, remember this) even though your dad was a butt- he will never want you to think twice about calling him when you need help. Will he be a butt again? Probably. But don't let that stop you. \nAs for how others are treating you- please realize you deserve better. In friends, relationships, jobs, coworkers, whatever. You are incredible and you can create a great life. You need to take a moment and realize your value. \u2661", "Okay, then I'll go with a more solid NTA.  (While it'd have been nice if she also got chatting to some guys you might have been interested in - no need to disparage her taste in guys.)", "But what point is there in berating an adult who chooses to go out for a couple drinks?", "It's good he picked her up but why on earth would he be furious and berate her for going out the whole ride home? That's excessive. She's 23 and wasn't doing anything wrong", "YTA calm down your friends life doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", "That isn't a friend, she chose to leave you when you went out together and she was your ride. This could have led to some bad scenarios. I would distance myself from her. \n\nNTA.", "I would say she\u2019s the asshole here and not you. I would talk to her about it as soon as possible and let her know that it wasn\u2019t a cool thing for her to do and you expect it to never happen again. Set the standards of your friendship now rather than have this sort of behaviour continue in the future. \n\nI think if you had talked about the ground rules for the night or what you wanted to get out of it and you knew that she was there to look for men then okay sure that\u2019s alright I guess but she asked you to come out to help you out of this rut you are in and have some fun. \n\nSo in that sense she set up very different expectations for the night. I know what it is like to have friends who go awol and behave like feral children when they\u2019re drunk but that still doesn\u2019t excuse the behaviour. You have to talk about it. It is so important if you want the friendship to continue. If you so choose to have the conversation depending on her level of emotional maturity she could get really unreasonably mad at you for calling her out, cry so you feel sorry for her or actually listen to what you have to say and take accountability-just be prepared for any of those scenarios. \n\nAlso regarding your dad, sounds like he\u2019s just being a typical annoyed parent. I wouldn\u2019t take his reaction too personally. I think if he had known what had happened, he would have comforted you. But I am just basing this on what my own and many of my friends parents are like\u2026\n\nGood luck to you. Hope you feel better soon!", "NTA come together leave together is the number one rule!", "NTA. You friend sucks. Your dad sucks. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you need a new friend OP. Hope everything is going okay with you after the break-up\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "NTA to the highest degree. In my hometown of Northampton, UK, there was a girl call India Chipchase who got left behind by her friend in a bar\u2026and yeah I\u2019ll let you google her name but it\u2019s trigger warning central so don\u2019t do so unless you know you are able to handle distressing content.\n\nNo women should ever leave other women alone out at night. It\u2019s sad it has to be this way, but in today\u2019s society women just aren\u2019t safe.", "We live in an area where getting an uber out of is easy, but if you go to far away (where the fun is :) ) there's a chance you may not get one going back.  We've received quite a few 1:30 am calls, can't get an uber and we go get them.  no complaints, even if there is a puker in the gang.  I'd rather they be safe", "You sound like good people. \n\nMy only conclusion from the post is that yes, the friend was an asshole, but OP's father is a disgrace of a man. Any father who would scold their child for being safe and responsible instead of being there for them unconditionally when they need it is nothing more than a glorified sperm donor. If picking up your daughter from a bar late at night is enough to make you resentful/tired of her, perhaps you shouldn't be a father, considering all the responsibilities that come with parenthood.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think a judgement should be made unless you talk to her. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever an AH for how they feel, but can be for how they handle things.", "I would be happy my kid called me instead of getting in trouble.", "It depends, but this isn't just some random adult, it's his daughter.  It's not relevant if there was a point to it, or not.  Maybe he has to get up for work early and now his sleep is disrupted and he is in a bad mood.  He has the right to be grumpy.  It doesn't make him an asshole.", "I think it was for going out for drinks without having a plan to get home. Was OP planning on riding back with her drunk friend?", "Let's be honest a 23 year old's idea of being berated and what her dad actually said is probably very different. As Judge Judy says: there's three sides to every story- your side, their side and the truth.\n\nIt amuses me on this sub how everyone takes what the OP says as gospel. My guess is, considering her Dad picked her up, he just told a few uncomfortable truths that in noway was berating her.", "NTA, but your best friend is a complete jerk", "Nta", "That's not your friend, baby. You need to cut unsay person off and ask yourself why you keep associating with toxic personalities.", "NTA\n\nShe did a really shitty thing to you! ANYTHING could have happened... no wonder your dad was angry - thank god he was able to pick you up and get you home safely.\n\nI'd re-evaluate the friendship if someone did that to me...", "NTA. Thank goodness nothing happened to you. If something did, your friend would have been liable since she was your primary mode of transportation of the night, and she would be the last known person to have seen you. If her night out was intended for her to go home with someone else other than you, that should've been something discussed way in advance. I highly suggest having a talk with her to discuss what happened and how to go about hanging out at bars moving forward.", "Is your friend still alive? I'd be more worried that she was impaired and leaving with 2 strange men than having to get a ride home.", "NTA.  Sorry that happened to you. Some women just have different ideas of what\u2019s normal. Now you know her girl code is different than yours and she\u2019s not the right friend to go drinking with.", "NTA, but friends as close as you said you two are don't abandon their friends for dudes at bars.", "NTA. She invited you out and then left you? I don't think she fully though through her priorities at that moment. \n\nI mean, if you really want to leave with some dude while out with a friend, AT LEAST help make arrangements for them to get home safely first. Never abandon a friend at the bars.", "OP, I\u2019m not going to say abandon the friendship as lifelong friendships are important and there may be a bigger issue here if you think there\u2019s a problem with her drinking. I definitely think it\u2019s important to talk to your friend about her drinking, but your safety is also important and she was not considering you or your safety when she invited you out to get over your ex then abandoned you for some guys. She not only put herself at risk by leaving with 2 guys while very drunk (not necessarily blaming her, I\u2019ve been there) and you were at risk being left alone, drunk, at a bar. If my friend and I go out, we go home together. Period. It\u2019s a scary world and anything and everything can happen, especially when there\u2019s alcohol involved. I\u2019ve read and seen too many horror stories of girls getting into wrong cars, being lured away, etc. Things could have gone a lot differently if you didn\u2019t have access to a ride (sorry your dad didn\u2019t help the situation) or you were more drunk\u2026", "Being in a rough place doesn\u2019t excuse behavior.", "OP indicated they got out there in an Uber. I'd assume she thought she could do that but it seems there was an issue.", "Right, so, it seems reasonable for her father to be upset that she went out and got drunk without a workable plan for getting home.", "I guess I see a difference in having no plan vs plan failing and needing to pivot. But again what's the point? There is none it was just to vent his frustration. All this is going to show is that when you need help and ask for it you'll get yelled at.", "Well, that's not all you'll get. You'll also get a ride home. Also OP has said in comments that he was disappointed, not angry.\n\nIf it's an area where you can reliably get Ubers, then sure, maybe it's not on OP, but then it certainly seems weird that waiting for one wasn't an option. And if it's an area where getting one is hit or miss, then that's absolutely bad planning.", "YTAH. How would your drunk friend staying with you have helped the situation? People go to the bar to get laid. No need to be a cock block.", "I have a rule. I will never as much as scowl at my son or my friends for asking me for a ride. I don\u2019t care when or where, I will be there.", "I have a hard time believing whenever the posts preface the situation with \u201cwe\u2019ve been totally best friends for __ amount of years (usually a decade or more, at *least*).", "Even when I was underage, my mom made it clear that I could call her anytime for any reason if I needed someone. No consequences.", "I was that same Mom."]}
