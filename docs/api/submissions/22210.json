My garden has an alley that leads to the front of our street, but his garden doesn't. He uses a mobility scooter to get around, and it doesn't fit through his front door, so when he goes out he goes down the path on my garden and down my alley. He even removed the gate between our gardens to make it easier for him to get through to mine. I had no problem with this. At least until now. \n\nI do a lot of gardening and recently I forgot to move some plants out of the path so I left them there overnight. I usually make sure to leave the path clear for him, but it is my garden so I figured I could leave my things on the path until the morning. I was wrong.\n I woke up to the sound of my neighbour shouting and swearing and banging on my kitchen window, shouting at me to come and move my things \"out of his way\". The way I see it, it's not \"his way\" and I'm doing him a favor letting him use my path, the alternative would be him using his front door and walking to a taxi to get where he's going. So it's much more convenient for him to use his mobility scooter to get to the street via my garden. \n\nBut since he's been so rude to me, I feel inclined to revoke his access to my garden. I know I might seem like an asshole because he's a disabled old man and blocking my garden would make life harder for him, but I also think he should have thought about that before he shouted at me. Thoughts?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of the advice, I appreciate it. As for the concerns about easements, I don't think that would be the case because he had his own access that he blocked off a long time ago, and my access doesn't actually lead to his garden, I was the one that created a sort of makeshift path leading to the alley from my garden, and he uses it.\n\nEDIT PART 2: Like a few people suggested, I  think I'm going to contact one of his kids before I do anything and see if they'll speak to him about it. I don't feel safe knocking on his door at the moment. Again thank you all for the advice.", "created_utc": 1689341036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zgdqs/wibta_if_i_blocked_my_neighbours_access_to_my/", "score": 2111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, it would have been neighborly and kind of him to not bang on your window, be rude, and demand access.\n\nHe should have asked nicely. That would have been the proper thing to do.

And I would replace the missing gate with a fence or wall immediately if he refused, or once the wall came down if he accepted.  NTA.\n\nEdit: It seems from the spelling and context that this may be in the UK. It\u2019s not uncommon for homes there to have a right of access across their neighbours\u2019 rear gardens, and this may be why there was a gate. It there is such a right documented it would likely be illegal to block the gate with a fence or wall.

What if he goes off the path in his scooter on your property and hurts himself? If he has no problems cussing you out in your own home, you could guarantee you'd take heat for him getting hurt.

The man gaining access to her alley was a breach in the first place that she allowed in order to be considerate/empathetic, now he\u2019s taken it even further by being aggressive and entitled. Most E S H voters are saying \u201cjust talk to him before you go that far.\u201d You expect her to just try to calmly explain this to a man who woke her up banging on her house and cursing at her?

He's not your problem!", "OP review your and his home titles for easements that allow him to use your pathway. These are very common in the UK for properties that do not have access for their own garden. Also consult an advocate as a prolonged period of access will create an easement, without signed agreement, by being in existence for a period of time. Also with him being disabled and having only 1 method of egress the courts will be more likely to side with him and could assign punitive damages to you if the determine you are in the wrong and have created problems for him.\n  \nEdit:\nOp if you created the gate for his use that would almost certainly create an implied easement considering his disabled status and your gate being the only method of egress for him. This would all be based on local law though.", "NTA. His age doesn't make it ok for him to be rude nor does his disability.", "NTA but before you exacerbate a tense situation with your neighbour, I would sit him down and remind him that he does not have a \"right\" to your garden.

My garden has an alley that leads to the front of our street, but his garden doesn't. He uses a mobility scooter to get around, and it doesn't fit through his front door, so when he goes out he goes down the path on my garden and down my alley. He even removed the gate between our gardens to make it easier for him to get through to mine. I had no problem with this. At least until now. \n\nI do a lot of gardening and recently I forgot to move some plants out of the path so I left them there overnight. I usually make sure to leave the path clear for him, but it is my garden so I figured I could leave my things on the path until the morning. I was wrong.\n I woke up to the sound of my neighbour shouting and swearing and banging on my kitchen window, shouting at me to come and move my things \"out of his way\". The way I see it, it's not \"his way\" and I'm doing him a favor letting him use my path, the alternative would be him using his front door and walking to a taxi to get where he's going. So it's much more convenient for him to use his mobility scooter to get to the street via my garden. \n\nBut since he's been so rude to me, I feel inclined to revoke his access to my garden. I know I might seem like an asshole because he's a disabled old man and blocking my garden would make life harder for him, but I also think he should have thought about that before he shouted at me.

Unfortunately your neighbor's ability to think rationally has degenerated along with his mobility.\n\nBanish the hope that a kind and reasonable response will resolve this issue.  It will get worse from here. Advise this person that you do not wish to see or hear them on your property again.  If you can contact his children or other relatives to intercede, do so.

After this call the police each time there is unwanted contact.\n\nYou might think my suggestions are severe but think about this; would a person with this level of entitlement hesitate to sue you if they took a fall while on your property?

It's not done lightly, it goes through a huge process between the physician, family, and ministry. The alternative is they end up homeless on the street, because regardless of your opinion, staff are people too and do not have to put up with abuse. I can think of one clear example: the staff were getting black eyes and cuts among other things, and the family was told they would have to be medicated. The family fought tooth and nail to prevent them from receiving the medication. The home gave them an ultimatum, either allow the doctor to calm them down so that the staff can safely take care of them, or they would be removed from the home and they can figure it out at home.\n\nI'm sure there's homes like you speak of, but its not an easy feat to bypass all the checks in place and just medicate every single person into being a mindless zombie. Does it happen though? Absolutely. People can be shitty and it's not unheard of, but its certainly not the majority of homes. Best way to avoid it is to avoid for-profit homes, because I can tell you that the residents and staff are a rounding error on the books.", "It's not a strawman.

My grandparents raised me for part of my life so he\u2019s also always been that stable father figure for me.

The place where my co-worker\u2019s elderly aunt used to stay at, tried to keep her \u201cdrugged up\u201d but she wasn\u2019t being aggressive at all. Sure, she\u2019d wander around the halls at night and try to rearrange furniture, but that was only because she couldn\u2019t calm/quiet down her mind and body enough to sleep at night.

That being said, the case for the aunt might have been more complicated than word of mouth can really tell you. Also biases come into play a lot. That example I talked about, the resident was completely docile with the family members around and didn't act out at all. Even in cases like that, they still have some semblance of memory of their past but can be really nasty to anyone else. It's complicated, I don't really want to get into the thick of it because it would go beyond my scope of practice even. What a family sees, versus what the staff see are often at odds.", "If something like that happens again, you can contact the State Board and tell them you're suspecting chemical restraints being used on the residents illegally.   They'll send inspectors there to make sure it's all legal.   (This is assuming you live in the States)  If there's ever any concern for elder abuse, contact the state.   They can shut facilities down instantly if it's bad enough.", "Sounds like he's an old disabled man who is likely in some degree of pain and doesn't have any patience. He's not correct in reacting that way, but we need to have the critical thinking to evaluate the mitigating circumstances and choose the correct response. Looks like OP is leaning towards some sort of conversation before moving proceeding, which is the neighborly response.", "I agree - he should get one more chance.
