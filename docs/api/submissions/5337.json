I was of course very saddened for him.\n\nHowever, I was more concerned for his Mother who was now a grieving widow. Friend here grew up in Toronto but moved 9 hours away to Quebec City last year for work. He bought a condo there and his intent is to stay there. He feels that Toronto is a city in decline and seems find quality of life better there. And there are parts I agree with. For example, Toronto housing is insane and Quebec City is more reasonable.\n\nHowever, I am a believer in family values - especially when it comes to supporting your mother. The one who has sacrificed everything for you with no expectation of reward. Right now, his mother needs him here, especially since his brother is still in university. I told him that he should ask for a transfer to the Toronto office so he can be there for his mother in her time of grief and later on as she gets older and has no one to care for her. He can move in with her, avoiding Toronto rent so that won't even be an issue anymore. And it is not like he has a partner in Quebec who doesn't want to leave her family. Nor is his present job not transferrable. He has no real reason not to move back but a major reason to.\n\nHowever when I brought this up to him he refused to consider my position and was annoyed. Apparently enough that he complained about me to a mutual friend, M29. He told the friend that \"I didn't seem to care about him, only his Mom whom I never met\" and that I should \"butt out of private family matters\". But here is the thing; Mothers do everything for us. They won't ask us for help and sacrifice their own well-being for us. But really we need to be there for them without them asking. My Father is in jail, has been in and out due to him being abusive. All this causes my Mother anguish. I know how much Mothers need their sons. It is not that I don't care about him; it is that he is a young man and that his mom is an older widowed woman - obviously her needs matter more than his wants.\n\nIf it helps you to have full context; all three of us graduated law school together in 2021 and we are all children of immigrants. Me and the friend who lost his father are South Asian descent - My family is Skih and his are Muslim. Our mutual friend is of Black African descent", "created_utc": 1671681128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsbctg/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_he_must_move_back/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP assumes women who become mothers have NOTHING ELSE but their children. No friends, no other family, no other support system. Because they are not humans, they are MOTHERS. A separate and distinct category, a series of virtual clones with the same wants, needs and interests.

What makes you think his mother needs him or even wants him to do this? You\u2019re applying your generalizations to their situation without giving any thought to his mother as an individual.

I hope you know that all mothers are not cut from the same cookie cutter you describe.  You also have no idea how the dynamics of your friend's family operate.  Everyone handles grief differently, and just because he isn't handling his grief your way does not mean he's wrong.  Did it occur to you that his mother doesn't want him there as she grieves her loss?\n\nGet your nose out of his business and put it back in its proper joint.", "YTA.. maybe you don\u2019t know the family dynamics and should mind your own business..\n\nAnd you need to quit projecting your feelings bc of your experiences with your mom onto your friend.\n\n\nInfo: with your father being in jail, do you live with your mom and take care of her?", "What I\u2019m missing is your friend asking for your advice on what *he* should do with *his* life.

How would you feel if someone tried to make you feel like an asshole for not moving back to support him?\n\nThat's why you should always mind your own shit, and leave others to make their own decisions on their shit.\n\nAlso, I know on some cultures it's more expected that you take care of your parents when they get old. But it's not as much of a value around here. Like, I would never want my kids spending their 20s and 30s looking after me. They should be out there building their own life during those years, and in doing that you sorta set yourself up to not need anyone else to support you in your twilight years.

Where do you find all this audacity?!", "YTA. While I respect there is a cultural difference at play here (I am white, female, and American), the idea that any child is obligated to put their life on hold for a parent is false. Your parents \u201cdo everything\u201d for you because they CREATED YOU. They mushed their genitals together and made a human because they wanted to (under normal, non forced birth/rape etc situations). Caring for your child with no expectation of some sort of return is exactly what should happen. Parents might sacrifice things, but that is the reality when you make another human! Don\u2019t want to sacrifice? Don\u2019t have babies. \n\nAlso, you have no idea if his mom even wants his assistance here. Why does he have to change his life plans because of your ideas of what a son should do? Your friend is right and you should butt out. Every person has to have agency and control of their own life. Your friend and his mother included. Their relationship is their business.", "YTA. You\u2019re personal values have no bearing here whatsoever.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nHey all,\n\nSo about a month ago a friend (M26) of mine (M33) lost his Father in a sudden death. I was of course very saddened for him.\n\nHowever, I was more concerned for his Mother who was now a grieving widow. Friend here grew up in Toronto but moved 9 hours away to Quebec City last year for work. He bought a condo there and his intent is to stay there. He feels that Toronto is a city in decline and seems find quality of life better there. And there are parts I agree with. For example, Toronto housing is insane and Quebec City is more reasonable.\n\nHowever, I am a believer in family values - especially when it comes to supporting your mother. The one who has sacrificed everything for you with no expectation of reward. Right now, his mother needs him here, especially since his brother is still in university. I told him that he should ask for a transfer to the Toronto office so he can be there for his mother in her time of grief and later on as she gets older and has no one to care for her. He can move in with her, avoiding Toronto rent so that won't even be an issue anymore. And it is not like he has a partner in Quebec who doesn't want to leave her family. Nor is his present job not transferrable. He has no real reason not to move back but a major reason to.\n\nHowever when I brought this up to him he refused to consider my position and was annoyed. Apparently enough that he complained about me to a mutual friend, M29. He told the friend that \"I didn't seem to care about him, only his Mom whom I never met\" and that I should \"butt out of private family matters\". But here is the thing; Mothers do everything for us. They won't ask us for help and sacrifice their own well-being for us. But really we need to be there for them without them asking. My Father is in jail, has been in and out due to him being abusive. All this causes my Mother anguish. I know how much Mothers need their sons. It is not that I don't care about him; it is that he is a young man and that his mom is an older widowed woman - obviously her needs matter more than his wants.\n\nIf it helps you to have full context; all three of us graduated law school together in 2021 and we are all children of immigrants. Me and the friend who lost his father are South Asian descent - My family is Skih and his are Muslim. Our mutual friend is of Black African descent\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA.  Why do you feel like this is your business??", "YTA for not minding your own business. \n\nIf mothers give selflessly without expectation of reward, why do you expect your friend to upend his entire life for his mother?", "YTA, albeit a well meaning  one. But you have  to mind your business.", "Everyone is in agreement in this thread, and you keep posting the same counter arguments. Maybe if you both were still in your countries of origin that would have more legs. You are children of immigrants. You do not have to follow strict guidelines of your ancestral countries. You are now living in Canada. Both of your sets of parents wanted a CHANGE from what they knew. Your friend is adapting, I suggest you do as well. You want him to follow a strict social norm from a different continent that started in a different time. It is no longer necessary in the society in which you live. \n\nKeep up this unnecessary meddling in the lives of others and he, along with other people, will be your ex friend(s). \n\nYTA", "YTA. My mother would have been offended if I insinuated she couldn\u2019t take care of herself after my father died. Every family is different. Trust your friend enough to trust that he would take care of her she needed him to. She\u2019s an adult woman who can make her own decisions.", "If you're so concerned, *YOU* go take care of her. \n\nYou've never met her: she could be abusive, critical, overbearing, judgemental, narcissistic... any number of things. He's right: it's none of your business. \n\nBUTT. OUT.\n\nYTA", "YTA. How is it anything to do with you? You should butt out of private family matters like he said.", "YTA. This situation doesn\u2019t involve you. You need to back off. Just because you have such great values and blah blah blah doesn\u2019t mean he needs to move to take care of someone who may not want or need it. \n\nYou can go live with and take care of your mom all you want but let everyone else do as they please.", "YTA - they're your values not his, stop trying to impose them on him. Not everyone has the same experience with their mother as you do - he cannot sacrifice the rest of his life now because his father has passed. If he's 33, she's probably not that old and could live for another 30yrs - what happens when he's in his 60s and has no life of his own because he gave it up for her?", "YTA. This is very much a cultural difference. Your culture tells you that you should keep the family together and close forever. Your friend\u2019s family and culture obviously isn\u2019t like that. He moved away and loved his new city and job. \n\nJust because you think he needs to uproot his life and go back, doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what he needs or wants to do. \n\nIf you keep pushing, he\u2019s going to just drop you. Because I would in his situation. He\u2019s mourning in the way he wants without going back to also wallow in his mother\u2019s mourning.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to add to this and it is very much AH. I really hope that your fianc\u00e9 that you talked about is from your culture from what I read. Because anyone else is NOT going to understand your view points and would definitely not deal with it.", "YTA.\n\nThings to consider:\n1. Not everyone has a good relationship with their mother.\n2. Not all mothers are created equal.\n3. Maybe his mom would be more upset that he was giving up his dream for her.\n\nBecause of what your family went through you are biased in how you think things should work. Just because it is the right thing to do for your mom, does not mean it is the right thing to do for his mom.", "Even from your perspective, he would be better off continuing his career so he could make more money to pay for her ongoing care.\n\nFrom my perspective? You never met this lady, and your ideas about motherhood require a lot of questioning.

She's not in capable of looking after herself.", "YTA.  Explain how any of this is your business?  You really know nothing about his family or what supports are in place. Explaining your ethnic backgrounds means nothing. Also - what world do you live in where you think it's just that easy to ask for a transfer and get one?  Maybe he has a toxic relationship with his mother.  Again - none of your business because you really know nothing about his family situation.  Worry about your own house first. Sounds like your need to meddle is an issue.", "Geez. YTA.\n\nI love my mom. I love her even more now that I'm not close by because we used to butt heads a lot. She also was the first one to tell me to find my wings and fly away even if she missed me. \n\nYour views and your relationship with your mom isn't the same view and relationships others might have. Stop seeing things with your own lenses and forcing it on others. If you want to be a supportive friend to your friend in his time of grief, ask him what he needs and just tell him you're there for him. \n\nIt's so disrespectful that you're minimizing his own grief by telling him to forego his life to cater to his mom. And extremely sexist and disrespectful too that you believe his mother is incapable of dealing with it without her son being a crutch. Can you imagine the added guilt to this poor woman? She just lost her husband and then her son is changing his whole life to do something she didn't even ask for or seemingly need? \n\nHell maybe he can help his mom transition to Qu\u00e9bec City too down the road. It is indeed a wonderful city with a great quality of life.", "YTA.  Not you, not your family - mind your own business.", "How do you know that his mother even wants him to move out? Maybe she's thrilled that her two sons are out of her house and living their own lives. Yeah, she's probably sad that her husband passed, but that doesn't mean she's desperate to have her grown son \"taking care of her.\"", "YTA now, and you were TA when you posted about this exact same scenario a couple of weeks ago. None of this is your business.\n\nYour relationship with your parents is not your friend's relationship with his parents.

He needs to figure that out for himself.", "You have a low opinion of his mom?", "YTA", "YTA - you gave unsolicited opinions. He doesn't want to drive that and he doesn't have to. Yeah, it sucks for his mom to now be a widow but she's probably more than capable of taking care of herself. Maybe he's sending her money already and you don't know about it but he doesn't need to move back there.", "YTA- you don\u2019t know if his family expects it or if he WANTS to. That\u2019s the only factor that matters. Some mothers suck. Don\u2019t put your expectations on your friend.", "YTA unfortunately not all mothers are good. Once people turn 18 they\u2019re allowed to be independent and put themselves first, even if it\u2019s not what\u2019s best for their parents.

I understand where you\u2019re coming from however and your heart is in the right place. But it\u2019s his decision and if he doesn\u2019t want to, he doesn\u2019t need to. Don\u2019t push it", "YTA. You can have an opinion, but you really don\u2019t have any right to tell him what to do or try to guilt trip him. That\u2019s manipulation. Just let people live their lives.", "Let's see...\n\nYTA for butting in on someone else's business.\n\nYTA for shoving your one sided biased views on someone\n\nYTA for having an overly idealized view of mothers that removes all culpability for abusive & neglectful mothers.\n\nYTA for acting like your friends life is expendable just because his mother is grieving.", "YTA.

A reasonable person would not expect a young adult to give up his independent life to go live in a borderline emotionally incestuous pseudo-marriage with his mother for the next several decades until she dies and he\u2019s left middle-aged and completely alone, because absolutely no one is going to date him while he\u2019s still mommy\u2019s live-in husband. The fact that YOU think he should do that doesn\u2019t make it reasonable.", "What makes your values better than anyone else's?", "No. Your values aren\u2019t my values and they aren\u2019t his values.  And values are subjective, not absolutes.", "No.", "Your cultural values might not be his and what is expected of you isn't necessarily what is expected of his culture.  Sometimes archaic cultural practices can be more harmful than good.  Example honour killings.  Don't judge anyone's culture unless there is a risk of physical harm", "No. Do you even know if his mother wants this? At the end of the day, his family relationships and dynamics are none of your business. Respect that people have different values than you.", "Question, do you still live with your mother and support her? Is she that helpless?", "I think you meant to say \"Shouldn't I as a former friend try to force my values on everyone for my sake?\"", "\u201cImprove his values\u201d ? \n\nDifferent values do not mean that he doesn\u2019t have them.", "No.  Forcing your values onto other people is exactly what you should *avoid* doing.", "Wow, trying to impose YOUR values on other people. First of all the guy is in his early 30s. Which means his mother is probably in her 50s or early 60s. Frankly that is not old so stop calling her an older widowed lady. Second of all, stop imposing your ideas of what a mother is on all mothers. Frankly, you should know better, that parents aren't all great and can even be abusive since your own father abused you. Do you seriously think it is only men that are abusive? Let me tell you there are plenty of mothers that are not great people or mothers. Have you read any posts on here about the mothers who don't want to take care of their own kids and try to dump them on others? Or how about the mothers trying to interfere in their grown children's marriages or lives. Maybe you should check out the raised by narcissists thread and see the abuse some of those people go through because of their mothers. You don't know what kind of relationship this guy has with his mother, what kind of mother she was, or whether she even wants or needs him there so keep your values and your opinions to yourself.", "Yep. A week or two ago. I\u2019ll try to find it.", "So you are a hypocrite on top of being a terrible friend..", "But mothers need their sons! Your mother is all alone and you haven\u2019t moved back home to take care of her!? But what about family values?", "You can leave. Kid can stay with their mum. Hell, you could move your mum to be with you, since you've indicated that it doesn't actually matter what mum's want they need to be near their kids. A giant hypocrite as well huh.", "If you really loved her you would give it all up since she made the \u201cultimate sacrifice\u201d for you. Right?? Since you\u2019re gonna practice what your preach???", "Well she\u2019s just old and useless apparently /s\n\nHe\u2019s acting like he\u2019s a spring chicken", "> Doesn\u2019t mean he has to uproot his whole life.\n\nThat is the thing. He doesn't have much to uproot. He is single, has an easily transferrable job, and a condo. That's it. He says he calls her every day which is nice but is not enough", "> Uprooting your entire life\n\nHe's only been in new town for a year. He is single, no kids, and has an easily tansferrable job. Only tie he has is a condo. Not uprooting much at all\n\nNo actually I am happily engaged", ">Or his mom doesn\u2019t want him to uproot his life?\n\nThat's an excellent point! I know for a fact my MIL would never want her son's to uproot their whole lives unless she literally has no other option.", "Interesting. Sound smilliar actually cause his mom and him are in similar lines of work. He says he calls her everyday. And doesn't like where she lives.\n\nWhat about where she lives is so bad that you can't live there. What were the discussions when you tragically lost your father. Just curious", "> giving up their career\n\nHe can build a career in Toronto LOL. Unless he is a french language police all jobs in Quebec City are found here", "His beliefs, that he doesn't even follow himself. It's worth tacking that on there, even though he's enough of TA anyway", "> That doesn\u2019t mean your poor friend who\u2019s already 33 hopefully has a family of his own has to drop his life and pretend to play husband to his mom.\n\nNow he is 26, I am 33. He doesn't have a family of his own and he keeps complaining about how he is single non-stop", "My father is very ill with cancer, no relocating here. Obviously we make a lot of trips and calls etc but he would be horrified if we moved back", "OP is too busy living with their own mother.\n\nBetter be anyway with \"values\" like that", "> 9 hours away is far. I would also only do that maybe once a year\n\nI've been a similar distance away and have come back every other week. The only reason I am not back home is because my fianc\u00e9 has a kid from a previous marriage so I can't leave Northern Ontario as kid and bio-dad need to bond.\n\n> I\u2019d never expect him to move in with me. I\u2019d be pissed if he was uprooting his life like that. He deserves to live his life in his own way.\n\nBecause you are a parent being sacrificial like parents are. But parents need help and kids need to take initiative to step in. He is not uprooting anything, all he has is a condo and an easily transferrable job. It is not like he has a wife who is a professor tied there on a research contract or something. He can easily move back but won't cause cheap rent and low traffic or something", "> Do you think he might be trying to avoid grief over his father?\n\nThis was before his Father's death he barely came over", "No there are are key differences.", "He would still be leaving the life he has built for himself. \n\nCalling her everyday is just fine! You are a terrible friend\n\n\nBut you don\u2019t live with your mom either, so you clearly have no room to talk.", "Just stop already. You can move back to your mommy or move her in with you. You may lose the fianc\u00e9 over that though. Most women don\u2019t like to share their house. You\u2019re a hypocrite. If you keep this up you\u2019ll lose your friend.", "So you are choosing some woman over your mother. Who did everything for you. Who sacrificed her well-being for your. Who needs you to be there without asking. And yet, you aren\u2019t even though you say you KNOW mothers need their sons. You continue to live hours and hours away from her and have not rushed home to care for her.", "She's still working? We're right in assuming she's around 50, aren't we...", "Sorry, what\u2019s funny about someone upending their entire life\u2026?", "You realize if he does what you would do he\u2019ll never have a family right? How successful.", "And you think forcing him to care for his mother will allow him time to date and possibly have a family?? \n\nBc it won\u2019t.", "He certainly won\u2019t ever need to worry about living with a partner.", "seriously, you just need to mind your own business.. your friend can do what they want, when they want. My parents would be so mad if I uprooted my life to move back home for them.\n\nParents what their kids to live for themselves and have their own lives..", ">  But parents need help and kids need to take initiative to step in.\n\nWhy do kids need to step in?  What if he already offered and she said no?  What if he just doesn't want to?  He didn't ask to be born.", "So, listen. Soft YTA. I think your heart is in the right place, but I feel like there's more to the story than he has shared. I don't feel like he's neglectful. It seems like he's avoidant. People don't avoid other people without reasoning. Maybe you could ask him if he's okay, or if there's anything you could do? If he hasn't opened up, I doubt he will but it could be worth a try.", "No, there really isn\u2019t. You chose to live away from your mom\u2026 your friend has that same right to chose..\n\nBut all of these internet strangers are telling you why you are an AH, and you still think that you are in the right..\nWhy is it ok for you to stay with your fianc\u00e9 and be happy, but he can\u2019t stay where he is and be happy?!", "Yeah, you don\u2019t want to.", "No idea re: age. I think so though. She is working that I know; just started cause she was mostly stay at home for much of his and brother's childhood", "Entire life of living somehwere for a year, being single, no kids. All he has is a condo there - only real tie", "Nah apparently he has a partner and that's why he \"can't\" follow his own values and live with his mother", "> It seems like he's avoidant. People don't avoid other people without reasoning.\n\nWhat do you mean? What could be a reason? I know he has suffered from depression but he is still social and all. Depression was a lot about lack of work and housing market and moving to Quebec fixed that for him. But it also was about not finding a partner. Not sure what his family has to do with any of this?", "No, no, that's a key similarity", "Dude she's finally getting to live her own life lmao. Leave the poor woman to do her thing", "Maybe she's looking forward to her independent life. It's not like she's in her 80's.", "SERIOUSLY, butt out.", "Do you even like your friend? You seem very antagonistic towards his life style.", "He is still trying to build his life there because he probably tried and can\u2019t back where his mom lives. Stop projecting onto your friend and live your life.", "It seems like he's avoiding going home. Do you know of anything that might have happened back at home? Not necessarily with his parents, but with other relatives? Former classmates? Bad boss?", "So you want your friend to move back to where he was depressed? You're sure that you feel like he is your friend because a friend would want their friends to be happy. \nAnd you don't think about the friends he's made when he moved that he's just gonna leave behind? That he would leave his life that he build for himself, the one that helped him get out of a depression? Are you sure that he doesn't have bad memories from his old home? Neighbors that bullied him? Been through something traumatic that makes it difficult for him to even enter his old town? You do not know his story and even if the case is that he just DON'T WANT TO its okay. You should keep your opinion to yourself.\nIt might sound tough but: people die, friends die, family die and there's not a single thing you can do about it. You can be there to support others but you shouldn't do it at the expense of your own health or what you want.\nAnd his mother lost her husband but he lost his father and you seem to forget that he has his own grieving to do and only think about his mothers.", "No idea honestly. How should I approach this?", "You leave it alone and mind your own business is exactly what you do..\nHoly smokes, if you were my friend, you wouldn\u2019t be anymore after putting yourself in family matters that are absolutely one of your business.", "You shouldn\u2019t.  Mind your own business and leave him alone.", "Tell him you're sorry if he feels you overstepped a boundary, and let him know that you're there for him if he ever wants to talk about it / that you'd absolutely respect his boundaries but you're not sure where they lie. He can't be too mad at you since you can't read his mind. Just keep it gentle.", "By minding your business and assuming he has a valid reason to want to do something different with his life than what you want him to do"]}
