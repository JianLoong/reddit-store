When I went to college I learned how to manage my time a lot more. I would go home and my parents didn't want me to hang out with her alone. It happened enough times that I finally asked why I can't bond with her without them hanging around. They told me that they don't want her to end up as I did and believed I am a bad influence. This hurt a lot and I stopped coming down often.\n\nThere was a problem with one of my dad's friends. My parents called me up and asked if I could stay in the house with my sister for the week and just exist there in case something were to happen since she can't join the trip. They were supposed to be gone for two nights. I told them no. That they don't want me alone with her so they can fuck off. They called me an ass and my sister is staying with a friend. I told my friend what happened and she basically said this is why they don't trust you and to grow up\n\nSo AITA", "created_utc": 1683498198, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13b4ywn/aita_for_refusing_to_watch_my_sister_for_an/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They didn\u2019t want you around her until it was convenient for them despite you turning things around. Did you miss some quality bonding time with her? Yes, but if something had of went wrong at the house there\u2019s no telling how poorly they would\u2019ve treated you. \n\nYour friend didn\u2019t have to be rude either.", "You're NTA. *you may not hang out with your sister alone.* (Insert emergency situation) *oh, can you possibly babysit your sister, but stay away from her unless something serious occurs*\n\nHeck, no. Your parents can't have it both ways. They either trust you or they don't. And it sounds like you've come a long way since those wild teenager days. If anything, you could teach your sister to not make some of the mistakes you made.", "So you can only be alone with her when it\u2019s convenient to them? NTA. Your parents suck. I could just be being petty cause I know what it\u2019s like to have parents that can do/say things to hurt you. But I\u2019m gonna say Nta", "NTA\n\nThey *didn't trust you*! And now they do? Why? Did they really change their minds? Then why didn't they tell you? \n\nAnd if they still believe they can't trust you, then suddenly their convenience is more important than your sister? Wow. \n\nYou were right to refuse. \n\nIf *anything* happend to your sister while you were there, or even if she changed attitude (as expected from a 16 yr old),  they'd be the first to blame it on you. No thank you. \n\nYour friend may just be young and ignorant, so maybe try to explain. But if they still think you should've accepted, then that's not a good friend", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t ever do a favor for anyone that\u2019s disrespectful to you. Even if they are family. Also your sister is 16 so she is more then old enough to be home alone.", "NTA: If they think you're a bad influence on her and don't want her hanging out with you, then they have no business asking you to babysit her. Good for you for saying no. How dare they even ask you that? The nerve!", "Picking your battles is hard, but having an opportunity to spend that time with your sister would surely have been more satisfying than pissing off your parents no?", "NTA you turned out amazing even with your wild days and your parents are wrongfully to compare your past to the person you are now in this situation TTA", "NTA. Your parents cut you off from your sister because you\u2019re a \u201cbad influence,\u201d then they ask you to be in charge of her when it\u2019s convenient for them? I wouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for my sister under those circumstances either.", "NTA, tell your parents this was 100% their doing - they clearly communicated that you were not the kind of person they wanted your sister to be around, that you were untrustworthy, *until the moment it was convenient for them*.  And then to act entitled to your time to watch her after that, a 1-2 punch of disrespect and hypocrisy, it's utterly obnoxious.", "NTA, but depending on how you feel about building a relationship with your sister, it might be a nice opportunity to get to know her", "NTA you\u2019re hurt by what they told you when you were younger. I think you should set your parents down and explain the hurt you feel.", "NTA.  If you can't be trusted with her, then you can't be trusted to watch her for a week.", "NTA Double standards, enough said", "NTA. 1 they failed to see your growth and only see you when you were a kid.  2 they didn\u2019t trust you before why should you be their back up plan. 3.  Your sister is 16. Why does she need a baby sitter?    Give her your number for emergencies and let her do her thing.", "ESH. \n\nYour parents are cruel to not allow you to bond with your sister nor be willing to accept, or it seems, give you a chance to show you have change. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s not your sisters fault nor yours. You passed up an opportunity to bond with your sister, and stick the middle finger to your parents and show them they were wrong. I get you are angry, but you haven\u2019t done yourself any good. The two things you are angry about, you had a opportunity to change and threw it out to prove a point to the parents. The better point would be them to see they were wrong. Instead you\u2019ve cemented their view. And let\u2019s say screw your parents, who cares what they think, or the reason why now, you\u2019ve pretty much told your sister your anger is more important than an opportunity of a relationship with her.\n\nI hope you get that with her one day and good on you turning this around.", "NTA.... the emergency was a friend not a family member.... they didn't want u to bond with your sister but suddenly want u to watch her while they leave... NTA..", "ESH. Your parents are an A for not recognising that you have changed. You are an A because you had a chance to spend time with your sister, yet you squandered it to get back at your parents. I quess sticking it to them was more important than spending time with you sister you claim to love...", "YTA.  You wanted to be trusted to show good judgment with your sister, but when your parents had an emergency and gave you the opportunity to prove yourself, you told them to shove it.  Thereby effectively proving they were right that you aren\u2019t mature enough for this. \n\nIt\u2019s possible your parents are TA also, but I don\u2019t have enough information about how far behind you those wild days are to judge that side of it.", "ESH tbh. It was an emergency. Don\u2019t get me wrong, your parents are definitely aholes. And you definitely can be proud of where you are now. But come on, im all for being petty, but just not at emergencies", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you subjected your parents to a lot of trouble and worry during your teenage years. It also sounds like you were consistently disrespectful of their rules and boundaries (no holier-than-thou judgement here; I was the same way as a teenager). It sounds like your parents still loved you and provided for you. So they hurt your feelings. Think about all the times you hurt theirs.\n\nThe fact that they\u2019re asking you means that you\u2019ve earned their trust back. Take that as the compliment it is, let your pride take a back seat, and help them out.", "YTA. You admit you messed up big a couple of times, and have had your life together for 3 years. How many years did you not have your shit together for? How much have you been around the family constantly in those 3 years that they could see the change? \n\nYou were guven the chance to actually prove you have changed for the better, but in an emergency you chose to be petty and tell your parents to fuck off. Was that the best way to demonstrate they are wrong in their thinking about you? \n\nIf you messed up big, your parents have every reason to be worried about your influence on your 16 year old sister. Their job is try to make sure she doesn't mess up big to. When you fuck up, you have to take personal responsibility for what you did, and work hard to make up for it in the eyes of the people you hurt. You don't get to dictate how long that takes. Your friend is right, you need to grow up.", "YTA you admit that there are plenty of reasons for your parents to think of you as a good influence. You probably put your parents through a lot of emotional distress in your party days. It\u2019s great that you have changed for the better and this was a perfect opportunity to show your parents that but yet your dropping the ball when they need you", "I mean,   yeah \u2026  they are complete fuckstix for the way they treated you. And I don\u2019t blame you for saying no. They deserved it. But on the flipside you missed out on what you\u2019ve been advocating for the whole time. A chance to spend time and bond with her. So while I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re the ah, You kind of screwed yourself.  NTA I guess for the bot.", "Ugh I kinda think ESH.  Them for judging you for your wild teenage years (which are entirely normal) and you because you say you love your sister and want to bond.  This wasted a very important opportunity for all of you.  However, they did say those things about you and have said they don't trust you, so how you choose to react to that is your choice.", "Leaning towards ESH\n\nDefinitely understand why you said no, but by doing so you missed an opportunity to prove them wrong and punished your sister for their behaviour. It could have been your sister who asked to stay with you and your parents choosing to ask you before she went to a friend.", "YTA.  100% agree with your friend.  You admit you were a not trustworthy as a teen, didn\u2019t become responsible until sometime in your twenties, and you are only 23.  Your parents don\u2019t trust because you gave them reason not to.  It\u2019s going to take time before they\u2019ll trust you.  You know how you build trust?  You watch your sister during an emergency.  You know how you re-enforce their views that you are an immature, untrustworthy person?  By acting like a bratty teen who doesn\u2019t understand that in an emergency situation you put aside pettiness and help out.  \n\nYour parents pretty much decided that they\u2019d take a chance and let you watch your sister and you ended up acting exactly like what they thought you were.\n\nWhen you act untrustworthy, you don\u2019t get to decide when people will suddenly start to trust you again.  They do.  You want their trust than act like a mature responsible person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Seems like her parents turned to her out of a lack of options.", "Its been like three years without a problem, you would think they saw that I changed even though I had issues in the past", "And their trust should mean something to OP because...", "Wasn't it also their job to make sure OP didn't mess up big too? Seems like her parents have some mistakes of their own they need to take responsibility for? Also who in their right mind says I don't want you around my kid because you will be a bad influence and the turns around and asks you to babysit.", "Or she could\u2019ve been opening up the door to all sorts of criticism if something went wrong-even something minor. I wouldn\u2019t have agreed either. I\u2019d be willing to bet that as soon as OP wasn\u2019t needed anymore; they would have gone right back to saying she was a \u201cbad influence\u201d.", "They gave you an opportunity to prove that you have your shit together and instead you decided to reinforce their beliefs.

Besides, I would bet that you weren\u2019t wild in order to hurt them and probably had no intention of hurting them at the time.\n\nReputations can take a long time to rehabilitate, and the fear a parent feels when she feels like her child is in danger or heading down a destructive path is so, so scary that it takes time to get over. My mom still very occasionally throws little daggers about what I put her through as a teenager, and I\u2019m in my 40s. \n\nYour pain is totally understandable. The question, I guess, is whether or not to let it guide you in making this decision.", "It\u2019s probably not just about whether you would go out partying, but whether they can trust you won\u2019t share tips for how to sneak out (even by anecdote) or tell stories that encourage your sister to do the same stuff you did.", "My understanding (and feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong) is that OP was hurt by the fact that her parents didn\u2019t trust her. If that\u2019s the case, then the fact that her parents now trust her enough to stay for days alone with her sister is a win.\n\nAlso, trust is a great thing to have in relationships. Earning and keeping a loved one\u2019s trust should always mean something.", "Right, because all teenagers listen to their parents all the time.  Some kids just won\u2019t listen no matter what their parents tell them to do.  Sounds like OP was one of these kids.  The fact that OP\u2019s sister isn\u2019t a troublemaker seems to support that OP might be one of those kids.  Oh and the fact that OP admits they were a handful.\n\nDid you ever hear the saying, \u201cBeggar\u2019s can\u2019t be choosers.\u201d  This is pretty much it.  OP\u2019s parents probably felt that while not ideal, they didn\u2019t have much choice and they might have even begrudgingly started to admit to themselves that OP has been acting better for the past few years.  This could have been OP\u2019s moment to proven that, yes, they have changed.  Instead OP has yet again showed no maturity or trustworthiness.  \n\nOP\u2019s parents basically said, \u201cHey, you said you could trustworthy and you are hurt that we don\u2019t see you that way.  Okay, fine.  We are in a bind, can you watch your sister two days?  We are giving a chance to show how responsible and trustworthy you are.\u201d\n\nOP replied, \u201cNah, I\u2019d rather nurse a grudge and then whine about how you don\u2019t trust me even though I gave you plenty of reasons not to.  You should be able to look into my soul now and just *know* I am now trustworthy.  Oh, and f you!\u201d", "And she should just jump at the \"opportunity\"? Nah. She's not obligated to accommodate them just because they have an emergency and lack a more \"responsible\" option.", "You don't seem to realize that as an adult, OP gets to decide, proving her \"trustworthiness\" to her parents is a waste of her time. Just because you turn down the \"beggers\" doesn't mean your immature, it could simply mean you choose to draw a boundary.", "That\u2019s her choice, but literally telling them to fuck off is only going to confirm their suspicions that she is immature and cannot be relied upon.", "Or that she has has no desire to play their games. I know plenty of mature, responsible people who tell people to fuck off. It's called setting boundaries."]}
