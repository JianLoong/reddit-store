We just moved in together and are fixing up our house on top of paying for the majority of our wedding. We both started new jobs this year, so money is pretty tight.\n\nMy brother (28M) is getting married in December (fiancee is 22F). They picked a Monday during the week as it held significance to them but also because she is still in college and will not have classes on that day. My whole family teaches, and the date falls right in our finals review time. It's incredibly inconvenient and stressful, but everyone is taking PTO to attend regardless.\n\nI am helping my mother pay for a bridal shower for my future SIL. I am doing the bridal jewelry as a gift for my future SIL. My fiance and I gifted the couple a gift off of their registry - a new fridge. Granted, it is a mini-fridge, but still, altogether, my fiance and I are spending almost $500 on their wedding, which will be the week before Christmas Day. If you include the time I am putting into the jewelry, it would come out to over a thousand dollars.\n\nMy brother sent everyone in the family a list of things he and his fiancee will want for Christmas. They aren't big things like appliances, except he asked each of us to get something specific. He asked me to get FSIL a specific jewelry box she loved that costs around $100.\n\nI told my brother no. He threw a fit about the spirit of Christmas being giving and told me he would be just as stingy with my wedding as I am with his Christmas. I won't have a registry because we don't need anything, so I said fine. For the record, he is giving everyone a bar of Irish Spring soap for Christmas. I don't feel a need to spend more just because they want more gifts. My mother agrees with me and thinks my brother's requests are in poor taste. She and my father are footing the bill for their entire wedding because my brother refuses to pay more than $50 for anything - food, photographer, all of it should be under $50 in his mind - and FSIL family can't afford much. My parents don't mind paying $10K for a wedding for their son, but they do mind him telling them he wants a 84-inch Hi-Def TV for Christmas immediately after.\n\nMy fiance, however, disagreed with me and thinks I'm an asshole. He thinks we shouldn't be stingy at Christmas, and he also pointed out that, as this will be her first Christmas as part of the family, it will make FSIL feel bad that she didn't get anything from us. I think that when we have our own wedding to pay for and theirs is literally the week before Christmas, they shouldn't be demanding more gifts on top of what they already have been given, which includes the fact we all have to take time off of work to attend and celebrate with them. Like, fine, maybe something smaller, but another $100ish seems excessive.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my brother I'm not getting him and his will-be-new wife Christmas gifts on top of all the stuff for their wedding?", "created_utc": 1700243808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xkumc/aita_for_not_wanting_to_get_christmas_gifts_for/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He should be grateful for what he's already received. Plus, with your own wedding coming up, it's understandable that money is tight. Stick to your guns and don't let him guilt trip you.", "NTA. It *could* be okay to send out a Christmas list to the family, if that's the norm.

He just wants everyone to bankroll his lifestyle and that of his wife's.\n\nI think it would be totally appropriate to give a small, thoughtful gift.

NTA", "NTA, your brother is a big thing wrong with Christmas.  Christmas is not supposed to be about you handing out a gift list to everyone and sitting back while they meet your demands.  To me after 18 even younger coming up with or passing out a Christmas list unless it is requested or part of an understood rule of a gift exchange is beyond inappropriate.  Christmas is a religious celebration and step one is you should be a member of a religion that celebrates the birth of Christ before you participate in the celebration.  If your not Jewish you don\u2019t start putting up random minoras and passing out gift list so why do people find putting up Christmas lights 11/1 and handing out gift lists appropriate for Christmas?  For those who are Christian and believe in Jesus, they should realize Christmas is about promise of new birth, family, thoughtfulness, the celebration of being a Christian, and forgiveness.  Gifts at Christmas after age 18 should be received and bought or made because someone thought of you and wanted to do this.  For those under 18 I totally get the tradition of and lessons of Saint Nicholas who was an actual Christian Saint and I get for young kids keeping the tradition of a Christmas list for Saint Nicolas alive.\n\nI say everything I do about Christmas not forgetting the fact that your brother sounds like a spoiled entitled human being period who you have been very generous to.

And who the heck announces more than 5 weeks before Christmas that he will be giving everyone soap?\n\nHaving said that, I can see the benefit of buying a gift for your new sister-in-law.

So, what about you and your parents (and any other family members who might also be interested) going in together to buy your future (by then new) SIL a gift she'd appreciate. It doesn't have to be the gift your brother is suggesting, it could be something else that she (not he) would get the benefit from.\n\nSo NTA for not getting what is being demanded, but I do think you could be an AH if you didn't at least gift a small something to show you are thinking of her.", "Buy him a 300 2nd hand fridge, give him $100 for Christmas.

Christmas is a holiday for gift giving. You don't need to get her the $100 jewelry box if you can't afford it, but something heartfelt for Christmas is deserved. \n\nMy bday is very close to Christmas and I always got these combined gifts that I hated!!! Or they would get me a gift for one, but not the other. My brother's bday was in the summer and he got a gift for both. What I'm getting at is the wedding and Christmas are two separate events.

Huh, was he ever \u201ctaught\u201d the meaning of Christmas? or did he just watch Scrooge every year and fall asleep halfway through it, why is he so special and everyone else so DIRTY they need soap? i haven\u2019t bought a birthday or Christmas gift for my mom in TWO years and counting because she decided she wanted to be passive aggressive and not accept any that year, (cause no one really loves me) so I will never buy her anything anymore\u2026.and your story is worse\u2026all that to say just please buy him some \u201cDOVE\u201d", "NTA - just regift him the soap \ud83e\uddfc", "NTA.

Now I'm like, \"Nope. Done.\"", "Why they are getting married:\n\n-Both are highly religious and uber conservative, so no sex before marriage, marry young, start popping out kiddos, etc., are strong, deeply held beliefs of theirs.\n-Her family is financially, psychologically, and emotionally abusive to her. She has been a provider for her family since she was old enough to work, and she has been more of a mother to her younger siblings than their mother. Best case here, my brother truly loves her and wants to take her away from all that. Worst case scenario - and I don't think it's this bad - he has found someone desperate enough to be in love with him and he knows he needs to lock her down. I feel like it's somewhere in between here.\n-Her family is not from our state. They are from out west and are moving back as soon as she graduates college. She hasn't told them about her job because she knows if she does, they will absolutely find ways to keep her in their house, paying their bills, for much, much longer. The sooner she is out of their house for good, the better.\n\nAll of the above.", "To be honest, I don't fully know. At first I was pissed because he's called my fiance a dirty Mexican in the past, so I thought it was that, but no, he's getting everyone soap.

Heck if I know why soap other than it's highly practical and won't go to waste.", "Pretty much yeah.", "To be fair - and other commenters made this point as well as my fiance - getting his wife a decent gift is probably more important than his thoughts on the matter. She needs to know we're not all giant walking/talking anuses.", "We actually use it to keep gnats out of our drains. I kinda like the smell, too.\n\nLike a multipack each would be a ridiculous gift, but one we could all laugh at and still use. A single bar each so he can save money on the multipack?
