I wake her up from a 3 hour nap at 8pm for us to go. She continues to stall as I constantly remind her \"c'mon we gotta get ready, we're both hungry so let's go\" but she keeps sitting in her bed trying to just cuddle and talk (which I never have a problem with I was just hungry and wanted to get there before they closed).\n\nSo in the end we finally get there at 10:30pm. Doors locked. Google maps said they closed at 11pm but I said they probably closed the doors an hour early so nobody goes in last minute. But there was a TGI Fridays right next door that didn't close till midnight so I suggested we go there instead. She starts crying. I hug her and tell her it's ok, it's just Chili's, worst comes to worst we'll just get fast food tonight and eat Chili's tomorrow. Her response as she continues crying \"but I want Chili's now!\" to which I (completely unexpectedly and out of my control) audibly laughed. She got mad at me for laughing but I calmed her down and we just got Wendy's instead.\n\nNow fast forward to this morning, this is her first day with this new position at work that requires get to wake up at 6am (as opposed to 8am when she used to wake up). We both wake up and I go to start prepping her lunch bag as she would get dressed. But this time I notice she's just standing there and not getting ready. \"You ok? C'mon you gotta get dressed, I don't want you to be late\" I say. And she immediately starts crying. I ask why and she responds \"I'm tired\". Once again I can't control the laughter as I am faced with somebody being this sad that they are sleepy.\n\nI don't think she's on her period bc she had it two weeks ago (maybe it came back early but she hasn't mentioned any cramps or anything). And now she won't talk to me, I told her we'll talk it out when we're both off of work. So am I the asshole or is she overreacting to mild problems?\n\nEdit: to people thinking me laughing at any girl crying is just my default that's not the case. I've never laughed at a girl crying before. Even she's cried for many other reasons in the past and I only hug and console her until she feels better. I only laughed these times bc of how small I felt the reasons to cry were.\n\nEdit 2: people are asking if she is depressed. I've only been dating her for a month but she has shown no sign of it though she told me she dealt with it in her teens. Though she has been stressed lately about the promotion she got at work but after last Friday everything she was stressed about is finished and she's been feeling significantly better since then.", "created_utc": 1690888545, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f9kez/aita_for_laughing_when_my_girlfriend_was_crying/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Is she usually like this?

I just started laughing thinking it was hilarious he took his acting that far.. he immediately told me he just choked and needed help. I helped him out, gave him water and apologized for laughing.

They mostly make people cranky.\n\nBeing pregnant however can make someone cry a lot and at weird times. She had her period two weeks ago, so she could be pregnant. Some women immediately start having pregnancy symptoms. For me those first weeks were just me feeling exhausted all the time.", "I'm alarmed your 21 year old girlfriend has cried 'many times' in the month you've been together.", "If you've only known her a month and you've seen her cry this many times then something is off.", "While I agree with you it's ridiculous. It's never a good look to laugh at your partner, because when the stories are getting repeated you'll be the heel. You should recommend she get into counseling, or date an emotionally stable adult.", "With OPs edits I agree NTA.", "Try reading the OP.", "If her period was really two weeks ago, then it's too early. It's possible that it wasn't a real period, though, and that she's over a month pregnant. \n\nOr she could be super tired and stressed. Which is fine, but she shouldn't get upset at you for, not unkindly, laughing when she cries at stuff like this. It's not like you're mocking her. If this isn't normal for her, and not hormonal, then she should recognize herself that she's being a bit ridiculous, although maybe doesn't feel safe enough to truly admit it.", "It takes a couple of weeks for the pregnancy hormones to be high enough to show up on a test. My friend was only a couple of weeks pregnant when she took a test because she couldn't stop crying. I don't want to scare you but the reality is that it's a possibility. Especially if this crying has just suddenly begun.", "I was about 2 months into pregnancy", "One of the most common reasons she starts crying is bc she says \"I love you\" but I won't say it back. I've only been dating her for a month and I explained that I feel it's too early to know for sure if I feel it or not. I told her I don't care if she wants to say it but I don't wanna be that kinda person who lies and says it back just to make the girl feel better. \n\nOther than that she'll just cry if a coworker is being mean to her or if she just had a stressful day of work or if she's getting stressed with bills to pay. Stuff like that. I always try to console her and help her through it but she does cry a lot and I've never laughed at her before.", "I have, he reacted like any normal human would. There's nothing wrong with how he's acted. He's not mocking her, he was just giving a reaction to her being overly dramatic. I would've thought my gf was joking around if she did this, any person would. OP did nothing wrong once, let alone twice.", "Women can still get a period and be pregnant. Just because she had it 2 weeks ago doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t. My SIL didn\u2019t even know she was pregnant until she was giving birth.  Rare but completely possible", "Dude, WTF are you doing. You've been together a MONTH and she's dumping all this on you already? Run, for fuck's sake. \n\nOr don't, but don't cry about the consequences - she'll laugh in your face", "This relationship sounds like an absolute mess. Like I\u2019d be confused at your interactions even if you said you were both 16 years old. You\u2019ve been dating for a month and this is your reality? Genuinely what the fuck are you doing???\n\nYour GF has the emotional regulation of a young child if she\u2019s throwing a tantrum about wanting to go to Chili\u2019s when the restaurant is closed, or crying because she doesn\u2019t want to get up early for work. Like obviously this is a dumpster fire. \n\nFrom this point onward, every tantrum or hassle or pain in the ass in this relationship is squarely on you for staying in it when things are this ridiculous a month in.", "As someone who also cries a lot from stupid things, it sounds like a mental issue. Being 24/7 on the verge of crying, holding back so many thoughts and emotions, even the smallest thing, such as the place I wanna eat at being closed, can break me and make me cry and shut down...\n\nShe probably has a LOT of issues. Either that or she is 4...\n\nAnd does she cry cry? Or \"cry\"? Like is it actually serious or a jokingly crying? (Or laughing while crying)\n\nIf she actually cry, laughing at her is the worst thing you can do... she is drowning in emotions and you only add more...\n\nIf she is not really crying, then I'm not sure why she would upset at you laughing, so I assume she is actually crying\n\nYou are only a month together, and you say it was like this from the start? Is she really in a mental place for a relationship now?", "She sounds exhausting to me. She can't handle her emotions. She might be over 20 but most of your post reminded me of situations with my 6 year old daughter. \n\nI totally understand the nervous laugh that might come out of you when you're facing crazy unexpected situations. You've got more patience than I do, for certain. \n\nNTA", "Sounds like you\u2019re dating someone who\u2019s emotionally stunted and their first reaction to everything\u2019s crying? Not sure why you\u2019re avoiding the \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "You have only been dating her for a month!?!? Sir this girl is red flags up and down the street. It is not ok to emotional manipulate someone anytime the slightest inconvenience happens", "Oh wow, she sounds like....a lot.  She may have some mental issues that are causing her to cry so often, as others have said maybe she is depressed.  But it sounds like you are having to do a lot of comfort and support - more like a parent than a SO.  And she expects you to say \"I love you\" for a one month relationship?  Maybe she's just going through a rough time at the moment, but don't get sucked into a relationship where you have to be this woman's caretaker all the time.  She is an adult.  You've only been with her a month.", "So you\u2019re together a month, aren\u2019t ready to say I love you, and are living together?", "I\u2019m glad you finally read the OP :)", "To be fair, he\u2019s already packing her lunches. \ud83d\udc40", "came here to say this. ditto!", "Sounds like my friends ex tbh.\n\nHe lived with us when they were dating and if she didn't have his full attention 24/7 she'd cry.\n\nShe cried once in the stairs because after coming home from a day out together he stopped to speak to my partner and I in the living room...\n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f people can be odd.", "I mean, okay? Lmao.", "It always helps when trying to engage other Redditors\ud83d\udc4d", "Ye, it let's you see how low the human IQ can get.", "Agreed. How dumb of you to ask questions without reading the OP!", "I reacted to your comment...\n\nYou know it goes like:\n\n\\-YTA, you did it twice.\n\n\\+Did what twice?(There's nothing wrong with what he did, so i'm asking did what?)\n\nIn which case you explain to me why what he did is wrong.\n\nEdit: Which you still haven't replied, instead kept this nonsense going.(You should assume people reacting to your comments read the post.)"]}
