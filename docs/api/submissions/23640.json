I wake her up from a 3 hour nap at 8pm for us to go. She continues to stall as I constantly remind her \"c'mon we gotta get ready, we're both hungry so let's go\" but she keeps sitting in her bed trying to just cuddle and talk (which I never have a problem with I was just hungry and wanted to get there before they closed).\n\nSo in the end we finally get there at 10:30pm. Doors locked. Google maps said they closed at 11pm but I said they probably closed the doors an hour early so nobody goes in last minute. But there was a TGI Fridays right next door that didn't close till midnight so I suggested we go there instead. She starts crying. I hug her and tell her it's ok, it's just Chili's, worst comes to worst we'll just get fast food tonight and eat Chili's tomorrow. Her response as she continues crying \"but I want Chili's now!\" to which I (completely unexpectedly and out of my control) audibly laughed. She got mad at me for laughing but I calmed her down and we just got Wendy's instead.\n\nNow fast forward to this morning, this is her first day with this new position at work that requires get to wake up at 6am (as opposed to 8am when she used to wake up). We both wake up and I go to start prepping her lunch bag as she would get dressed. But this time I notice she's just standing there and not getting ready. \"You ok? C'mon you gotta get dressed, I don't want you to be late\" I say. And she immediately starts crying. I ask why and she responds \"I'm tired\". Once again I can't control the laughter as I am faced with somebody being this sad that they are sleepy.\n\nI don't think she's on her period bc she had it two weeks ago (maybe it came back early but she hasn't mentioned any cramps or anything). And now she won't talk to me, I told her we'll talk it out when we're both off of work. So am I the asshole or is she overreacting to mild problems?\n\nEdit: to people thinking me laughing at any girl crying is just my default that's not the case. I've never laughed at a girl crying before. Even she's cried for many other reasons in the past and I only hug and console her until she feels better. I only laughed these times bc of how small I felt the reasons to cry were.\n\nEdit 2: people are asking if she is depressed. I've only been dating her for a month but she has shown no sign of it though she told me she dealt with it in her teens. Though she has been stressed lately about the promotion she got at work but after last Friday everything she was stressed about is finished and she's been feeling significantly better since then.\n\nEdit 3: no we do not \"live\" together. I live an hour and a half away from my job but she's only 10 minutes. So on the 2-3 days a week that I'm scheduled to work morning shift I stay with her to be able to sleep in a bit and enjoy less of a commute. Plus it gives us those days to hang out since I live so far from her.
