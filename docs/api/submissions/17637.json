They key to a great relationship is communication. He doesn't know what you're thinking. Don't hint around to spare his feelings or you're gonna end up living with a dog you hate and miserable for the next 10-15 years.", "I am a dog person. My dogs are the joy of my life. But not everyone likes them and that's okay. Being in a relationship is about compromising. If he wants a dog and you don't, that's fine. Nobody can force you to own a dog and it wouldn't be good for said dog either.\n\nNTA. But I'm afraid you might not be compatible.", "NTA for not liking dogs\n\nBut you *need* to tell him exactly how big of a deal this is for you while the puppy is still hypothetical. Because it'll be a million times harder to figure out a plan when an adorable puppy is in his lap gazing at him and he already loves it.\n\nTell him you will never be happy living in a home with a pet, and that if he gets a dog, living together is basically off the table. Don't present it as an ultimatum, but make it clear that \"if X, then Y\" will occur.\n\nIn terms of the schedule, plenty of people in their 20s have dogs, and kids for that matter, and they make it work. I wouldn't make that your hill to die on, because it's an extremely weak argument and he won't take it seriously. It's not your schedule that will be interrupted/altered.", "NTA. You need to be a lot clearer on your feelings on the subject. You do not get to decide for him whether he gets a dog or not, but you can decide what your personal involvement/ actions are going to be. If you never see yourself living with a dog and do not see anything long term with a dog owner, tell him that. \n\nIf he wants a dog that much and you are that oppossed to it, it is possible that you are not compatible long-term anyway. This is a big sacrifice for either party to make.", "No asshole.  You both have things you like and dislike.  Having a pet is a big responsibility (and can be for over 10 or 15 years). It's not a decision to make lightly on his part.  I couldn't tell if you live together or not, but if not, let him make the choice.  If you do live together, it needs to be a joint decision or maybe he isn't the person for you.  Either way, you need to openly express your concerns and maybe have a friend moderate so you both can have your say.  Animals are not for everybody, and when relationships get jostled, the pet  usually ends up on the losing side (in a shelter).  Don't let it come to that kind of ultimatum for him or you.  Be honest before there's an animal in the mix.", "NTA, before he adopts sit down with him and explain clearly and concisely that he will be solely responsible for everything related to the dog and to never expect you to step in if he has an issue where he can't take care of the dog.  If he goes on a weekend trip, he has to board the dog, if the dog needs some form of medical care then he has to take the time and bear those costs, etc...  \n\nI would go as far as writing up a contract and having him sign it before he adopts the dog.", "NTA, but this should be communicated clearly, and soon.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At that stage it\u2019s none of your business. You\u2019ve already told him your concerns so leave it at that", "How can you not like dogs? Are you Chinese ? They eat dogs over there.", "NTA. You are right and all of your concerns are valid. If you two plan on ever moving your relationship forward, you would have to cohabitate with a dog, and it would make your life miserable.", "NTA - \nI have a dog and my bf is not a dog person. He made it clear at the start of our relationship that he did not want to be involved in any responsibilities related to my dog.\n\nHe is perfectly nice to the dog, pets him/gives him  treats etc and on odd occasions (if I have to work late or am sick) he will feed him and take him out to pee. \n\nA dog is a huge responsibility and it's important you make it clear to your bf that it will be his and his alone. \n\nThe cleanliness issue - yes dogs get muddy and sometimes vomit or may have accidents (especially a puppy) so this is a concern for living together in the future because even if you agree your partner needs to clean up after the dog, you will still be exposed to this in some way.", "NTA, but probably just not compatible. Most dog people I know can't imagine life without one. So you'll either give in and hate it, or your partner won't get one and resent you. No easy answers.", "Agree. Also, make sure to tell him that you will not be taking care of the dog if your BF needs to travel - he will need to find someone else.\n\nYou can't tell him what to do, but telling him how you feel (that you don't want to take care of a dog and never want to live with one) is totally fine.", "5 months- I do recognize that it may be too soon for me to really have a say in the matter. Which is why I\u2019m asking in here. Despite the short time our relationship has gotten quite serious- we are very in love and have both expressed we are in this for the long haul. That\u2019s why I\u2019m stressing so much about it. I\u2019m fully committed to him, but not his animal", "She could tell him that she wouldn\u2019t ever want to live with the dog though. They need to know if they have basic incompatibilities. \n\nI do think it\u2019s a bit thick that he simply says, \u201chow can you not like dogs?\u201d\nLots of people don\u2019t like dogs.", "Which is why you have to tell him NOW that you don't want to share the living space with a dog. Let him make a choice if he wants a dog or continue the relationship, cause yeah, that's a pretty serious issue.", "ah. do you guys live together?", "its not too soon to express your feelings on such a huge commitment, and one that you dont want at the moment at least. better to express your feelings now before continuing the rls and you being unhappy bc of it"]}
