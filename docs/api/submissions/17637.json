Being super clear about this now is the absolute best thing for you, your BF, and his hypothetical dog. If you are that opposed to living with a dog, and you want to live with your BF eventually, he needs to know how you feel so he can make an informed decision.\n\nStory: my mom had a cat when she met my dad. My dad is very much not a cat person. He especially hates the fact that they walk in their litter boxes and then walk around the house with (in his mind; please don't come at me, cat people) poop germs on their feet. But he loved my mom and wanted to live with her and she came with a cat, so he said ok. But then he tried to \"train\" the cat in ways that were almost guaranteed not to work. The cat started \"acting out\" (again, in his mind), vomiting, pooping outside the litter box, the stuff cats do when they are stressed. It was a terrible cycle where my dad would double down on \"training,\" the cat would get more stressed and \"act out\" more, and so on until my mom finally could not keep her cat. They've been married 40 years and she has never had another cat.\n\nIf my dad had told her, you know, I really don't like or understand cats and I don't think I can live with one, would she have rehomed the cat in order to move in with him? Broken up? Stayed living separately until the cat passed away? I don't know. Maybe she doesn't either. But she deserved the chance to choose for herself, and so does your BF. He might get mad at you but it will be so much worse if you downplay how you feel now and then end up living with an animal that grosses you out and annoys you. You might be more adaptable and less of a jerk than my dad, but you're not likely to be able to swallow your disgust and resentment when there is a dog in your home all day, every day.\n\nETA: also I say this as an absolute dog person. Dogs deserve humans who love them just as much as humans who dislike dogs deserve dog-free homes.", "Saying \"this is something I am unwilling to do\" isn't an ultimatum, it's information.\n\nBecause I think what you are learning is that your guy is a \"dog person,\" while you have no flexibility when it comes to having one. \n\nSo this is a really important moment for you to say that you don't want this \u2014 ever, and that you both need to figure out if he can live without one so that you know whether it's sustainable for you to live *together.*\n\nThis issue is in compatibility territory.

Question is if his wish for a dog is bigger than sharing his life with you, in which case you might have to move on so you both can have the life you want...\n\nI would never stay in a relationship where I cannot have pets or need to impose them onto others.

With that information he can make an informed decision moving forward and so can you. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are in a position to try forcing him not to get a dog but it will obviously change the trajectory of your relationship and he should not that. Not as an ultimatum but for his awareness. If he goes forward with adopting a dog while you are not living together and your position remains the same then you won\u2019t be moving in together and the relationship may not advance. On the other hand if he moves ahead and your position changes then so be it. \n\nBottom line to me is these are the sorts of things that when they arise should be clearly discussed in a relationship.

I am not going to be responsible for or involved in any training, cleaning, grooming, ....\" \n\nHaving a dog or other dependent changes someone's life, and as many posting in this sub show, sometimes someone's choice to bring a dependent into their life is based on the idea that someone else will do the work.", "That he is dismissive of your concerns is an issue.

Training, regular walking, bathing, appointments, dealing with chewed skirting boards - ha - chewed everything etc. \n\nSome have suggested you get a puppy agreement in place but training takes reinforcement, same as with kids - it doesn't work in black and white that one person does everything and it's frustrating that this is advocated for so frequently on this sub.\n\nLifestyle changes are a game changer and do need factoring in these conversations - is your other half very active eg hiking, cycling or a gamer and does getting a dog enhance or hinder that? Do you both enjoy spontaneous nights out with friends? Are you both at home a lot to take care of a growing puppy? He needs to think. He might want a dog but does he need one right now with his current lifestyle. \n\nNTA - and fwiw, I think you may be incompatible and you'll wake up one day to find you are the sole carer of a badly-trained animal you didn't want.

She's a very sweet dog and it's possible to have a clean home with a dog if it comes down to it. Here's a few examples:\n\n- She trained her to stay still before coming inside and she wipes her paws off with wet wipes, and trained her to lay down so she can check her for ticks\n- She trained her to only go on the couch if there's a blanket down. if there isn't a blanket on the couch, she won't go on it and she will silently beg someone to put a blanket on so she can lay down\n- She takes her to the groomer once a month and shaves her fur short so she doesn't shed as much hair\n- She tried to train her to put her toys back when she was done (but she only does it sometimes, lol)", "YTA.

I'm not saying you won't love each other or argue constantly or anything, but if you end up living together you'll either have a partner who wants to have a dog and can't because of you and slowly builds up resentment towards you because adults generally don't like feeling limited by other people, or you'll be living together and you'll hate having the dog and slowly build up resentment towards your partner for saddling you with a dog you hate. Talk about it now and see if you can come to a solution (getting a cat, getting a dog but compromising about what the house rules will be with the dog, waiting to get a dog till a little later in life etc) but know you can't take the dog want out of a dog person, and you can't force yourself to like dogs.
