You need to be a lot clearer on your feelings on the subject.

It's not a decision to make lightly on his part.  I couldn't tell if you live together or not, but if not, let him make the choice.  If you do live together, it needs to be a joint decision or maybe he isn't the person for you.  Either way, you need to openly express your concerns and maybe have a friend moderate so you both can have your say.

You are right and all of your concerns are valid. If you two plan on ever moving your relationship forward, you would have to cohabitate with a dog, and it would make your life miserable.", "NTA - \nI have a dog and my bf is not a dog person. He made it clear at the start of our relationship that he did not want to be involved in any responsibilities related to my dog.\n\nHe is perfectly nice to the dog, pets him/gives him  treats etc and on odd occasions (if I have to work late or am sick) he will feed him and take him out to pee. \n\nA dog is a huge responsibility and it's important you make it clear to your bf that it will be his and his alone. \n\nThe cleanliness issue - yes dogs get muddy and sometimes vomit or may have accidents (especially a puppy) so this is a concern for living together in the future because even if you agree your partner needs to clean up after the dog, you will still be exposed to this in some way.", "NTA, but probably just not compatible. Most dog people I know can't imagine life without one. So you'll either give in and hate it, or your partner won't get one and resent you. No easy answers.", "Agree. Also, make sure to tell him that you will not be taking care of the dog if your BF needs to travel - he will need to find someone else.\n\nYou can't tell him what to do, but telling him how you feel (that you don't want to take care of a dog and never want to live with one) is totally fine.", "5 months- I do recognize that it may be too soon for me to really have a say in the matter. Which is why I\u2019m asking in here. Despite the short time our relationship has gotten quite serious- we are very in love and have both expressed we are in this for the long haul. That\u2019s why I\u2019m stressing so much about it. I\u2019m fully committed to him, but not his animal", "She could tell him that she wouldn\u2019t ever want to live with the dog though.

Let him make a choice if he wants a dog or continue the relationship, cause yeah, that's a pretty serious issue.", "ah. do you guys live together?", "its not too soon to express your feelings on such a huge commitment, and one that you dont want at the moment at least. better to express your feelings now before continuing the rls and you being unhappy bc of it", "NTA. Being super clear about this now is the absolute best thing for you, your BF, and his hypothetical dog. If you are that opposed to living with a dog, and you want to live with your BF eventually, he needs to know how you feel so he can make an informed decision.\n\nStory: my mom had a cat when she met my dad. My dad is very much not a cat person. He especially hates the fact that the walk in their litter boxes and then walk around the house with (in his mind; please don't come at me, cat people) poop germs on their feet. But he loved my mom and wanted to live with her and she came with a cat, so he said ok. But then he tried to \"train\" the cat in ways that were almost guaranteed not to work. The cat started \"acting out\" (again, in his mind), vomiting, pooping outside the litter box, the stuff cats do when they are stressed. It was a terrible cycle where my dad would double down on \"training,\" the cat would get more stressed and \"act out\" more, and so on until my mom finally could not keep her cat. They've been married 40 years and she has never had another cat.\n\nIf my dad had told her, you know, I really don't like or understand cats and I don't think I can live with one, would she have rehomed the cat in order to move in with him? Broken up? Stayed living separately until the cat passed away? I don't know. Maybe she doesn't either. But she deserved the chance to choose for herself, and so does your BF. He might get mad at you but it will be so much worse if you downplay how you feel now and then end up living with an animal that grosses you out and annoys you. You might be more adaptable and less of a jerk than my dad, but you're not likely to be able to swallow your disgust and resentment when there is a dog in your home all day, every day.\n\nETA: also I say this as an absolute dog person. Dogs deserve humans who love them just as much as humans who dislike dogs deserve dog-free homes.", "Saying \"this is something I am unwilling to do\" isn't an ultimatum, it's information.\n\nBecause I think what you are learning is that your guy is a \"dog person,\" while you have no flexibility when it comes to having one. \n\nSo this is a really important moment for you to say that you don't want this \u2014 ever, and that you both need to figure out if he can live without one so that you know whether it's sustainable for you to live *together.*\n\nThis issue is in compatibility territory. It's needs to be addressed honestly.\n\nNTA", "YTA.\n\nYou're free to tell him that you don't like dogs, and that you think him adopting one would negatively affect your relationship (and I do recommend doing so), but I think, as a 5 month GF that doesn't live with him, it's not really your place to tell him not to adopt a dog, flat out.", "NTA.\n\nThough if he really wants a dog in his life and you absolutely not, than there's no compromise to be found. Question is if his wish for a dog is bigger than sharing his life with you, in which case you might have to move on so you both can have the life you want...\n\nI would never stay in a relationship where I cannot have pets or need to impose them onto others. A life without pets (especially dogs or cats) is not a life I would want, like ever... so that would absolutely be a dealbreaker for me. \n\nSo you will need to have this conversation upfront. And better now than wait.", "NTA for not liking dogs (and I am a dog lover). NTA for being straightforward and telling him about your position. In fact I applaud that. With that information he can make an informed decision moving forward and so can you. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are in a position to try forcing him not to get a dog but it will obviously change the trajectory of your relationship and he should not that. Not as an ultimatum but for his awareness. If he goes forward with adopting a dog while you are not living together and your position remains the same then you won\u2019t be moving in together and the relationship may not advance. On the other hand if he moves ahead and your position changes then so be it. \n\nBottom line to me is these are the sorts of things that when they arise should be clearly discussed in a relationship. That way everyone can make their own decisions and let the chips fall. If you were already living together then my thoughts would be different.", "You've got a problem here and there's no right or wrong. Your boyfriend loves dogs and wants to adopt one. And he doesn't understand how you can dislike dogs. \n\nNevertheless, you find dogs to be overall dirty creatures that upend schedules and you'd be aghast to having one in your home. \n\nDepending on how badly he wants to own a dog--and it sounds like he does--this *may* be the beginning of the end of your relationship. NTA.", "He is not listening to a word you say because you're being too gentle about it.\n\nTell him no dog or no you, because otherwise all the things about dogs that you hate WILL BECOME A PART OF YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE.\n\nFurther, as he always goes off on trips, etc., YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE DOG.\n\nNOT HIM.\n\nYOU.\n\nBeing gentle about it gets you nowhere. I like dogs, but they are a lot of trouble, worth it only to dog lovers and you are not one.\n\nTell your BF you'll end the relationship if he doesn't give up the dog idea, because if he gets one your life will be so unhappy you will be leaving him, anyway.", "Geez. N T A is saying that OP's boyfriend is the asshole. There's nothing he's doing wrong here either.\n\nNAH here. You don't want him to have a dog, fine. You're thinking forward how this could impact your relationship. That said, this is a compatibility issue and if he decides to break up with you over this that's also reasonable.", "\u201cHow can you not like dogs?\u201d  \n\nThis is something that you need to address because it seems to me that he could be thinking that you would change your mind once you see the puppy.  \n\nNTA, you two need to sit down and talk, you need to make clear that a lot of young people can make it with the responsability of a dog but for that they have to like it and in the end you don\u2019t", "Well put. I was thinking that OP could, if too nervous to start verbally, could draw up some summary points. Another thing this might need to involve is OP's boundaries along with not living with a dog. \"I'm not willing to be a pet sitter. I will not be contributing to any vet or other pet bills or financial obligations. I am not going to be responsible for or involved in any training, cleaning, grooming, ....\" \n\nHaving a dog or other dependent changes someone's life, and as many posting in this sub show, sometimes someone's choice to bring a dependent into their life is based on the idea that someone else will do the work.", "That he is dismissive of your concerns is an issue. Saying because cute means that he *hasn't* thought it through properly. Training, regular walking, bathing, appointments, dealing with chewed skirting boards - ha - chewed everything etc. \n\nSome have suggested you get a puppy agreement in place but training takes reinforcement, same as with kids - it doesn't work in black and white that one person does everything and it's frustrating that this is advocated for so frequently on this sub.\n\nLifestyle changes are a game changer and do need factoring in these conversations - is your other half very active eg hiking, cycling or a gamer and does getting a dog enhance or hinder that? Do you both enjoy spontaneous nights out with friends? Are you both at home a lot to take care of a growing puppy? He needs to think. He might want a dog but does he need one right now with his current lifestyle. \n\nNTA - and fwiw, I think you may be incompatible and you'll wake up one day to find you are the sole carer of a badly-trained animal you didn't want. And a dog.", "They don't live together at the moment."]}
