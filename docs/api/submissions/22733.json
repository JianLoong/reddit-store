Destination weddings are ok as long as the couple isn't mad at people for not attending.", "NTA. \n\nNo one has to \"sacrifice\" to support their friend's wedding. \n\nWhen I get a wedding invitation, I look at my calendar and my finances and decide if I can make it. Of course for people I am close to, I move things around, save a little money here, whatever I need to so I can make it work. But that isn't a sacrifice, just like being asked to go on vacation and having to take time off work and spend money isn't a sacrifice. \n\nIf you can't afford to go, you can't afford to go. You shouldn't be going in to debt or putting off your future for an event like this. Is Sarah going to spend the same amount of money on you to celebrate your \"special day\" when you buy a house? Doubtful. \n\nHer wedding is HER special day, and it is lovely to invite people to celebrate with you, and it is lovely to be able to celebrate with a couple. But, when you have a big event, some people can't make it for various reasons- work, competing event, travel- and when you make your wedding harder to attend with a destination that requires lots of people to travel, less people can make it. That's just how it is. \n\nLet Sarah be distant. You can send a card/present and tell her you still want to help out with anything you can, you simply cannot afford to go to her wedding AND pay your bills (she doesn't need to know about your savings account or other money, and she doesn't get an opinion on how you spend or save). This way, you are extending an olive branch AND being clear that you can't attend because you can't afford to. Now that you have been clear, it is up to her to make the next move.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m all for destination weddings but they have to come with the expectation that some people won\u2019t be able to make it due to the cost.

I have been to a couple and have always had a great time.

She\u2019s probably just hurt and not mad.", "When you choose to have a destination wedding, there should be NO OBLIGATION for anyone to attend.  It is a HUGE expense and it is unreasonable and selfish to expect/demand people attend.  We did it with my daughter (her choice) and I was very clear to everyone that I completely understood if they could not make it.  You should have to give no reasons for not attending.  It's a big ask.  \n\nThat being said, I'm not against destination weddings.  They are magical and wonderful to celebrate with the friends and family who are able to make the trip.  My point is it should be 100% their choice and there should be no guilt trip if people can not make it. \n\nNTA!", "NTA: If you plan a wedding with a big financial burden on your guest you have to live with most of them not comming.

I offered a possible solution and said you could always get married wherever you want but then have the reception back home after, if you wanted more of your friends and family to attend. I thought it was a good compromise since she seemed upset so many people would not be there. She didn\u2019t like my idea and said if people truly loved her they would be there.

You're not wrong and I understand her being hurt but she wasn't considerate of others when expecting them to pay a large amount for travel and lodge.", "NTA obviously. I didn't attend my best friend's wedding and she didn't attend mine. We live across the country from each other and at the time we just weren't financially secure.

When someone decides to throw a destination wedding, they need to do so understanding that because it is more expensive for guests to attend, fewer will attend.  Oftentimes, in these circumstances, the bulk of wedding expenses falls on the guests because hotels will give you a discount if you have a larger block of rooms etc. Your friend has no right to spend your money for you. I am sorry she is getting so bent out of shape on this.

I and some others will be attending a wedding in a country we don\u2019t live in. The bride and groom live there.

Grump over.", "NTA \n\nPeople who have destination weddings should expect people not to attend.", "One of my former close friends did something similar. They lived across the country and were beyond pissed that I couldn't afford to come to their wedding.

If it was the other way round, I imagine she would not go without anything important for you.", "My fianc\u00e9e and I have discussed a destination wedding. The express reason that we discussed it is because so few people would be able to attend. We\u2019d fulfill our societal/family obligations if inviting extended family, old friends, etc. without too many people actually showing up. I kinda thought that was always the point of a destination wedding, because it\u2019s a huge pain in the ass for anyone who isn\u2019t the bride or groom.

And any premise that starts with \u201cIf you value our friendship\u2026\u201d needs to be stopped right there.", "NTA \nI've come to realize destination weddings are the most selfish thing in the world. Not many people can even afford a $1,000 emergency but have to pay thousands to a foreign country, passport, airplane flight, hotel, transportation, food, clothes, ect. The cost can easily get to $7,000-10k. \nThe list is insane and your friend is very selfish for that. Not everyone had the means to do that so for her to get upset at you means she's not your actual friend. A friend would understand your financial situation and wouldn't make you feel bad about it. She's just selfish through and through.", "I think destination weddings are stupid and selfish . What ever happened to getting married close to home then go to some exotic place for a honeymoon . The purpose of having a wedding is to celebrate this next stage of your life with family and friends .the fact that if you are going affect long-standing friendships by judging their love by how deep into debt they are willing to go for you is the definition of self centered", "I'm often astounded how many people are just... I'll be nice and say ignorant about how the world works and basic reality. I came across it a lot when I worked retail when people were demanding high end products for 1970s prices or outraged that they need to give their social security number when applying for a store credit card because they never had to give one for all their other credit cards. Made me wonder how people lived so long and didn't know basic life things I knew as a teenager.\n\nI don't understand how people can not realize that an extravagant destination wedding guarantees that you are essentially excluding people that can't justify spending a lot of money or take enough time out of work from making it. Its such a basic and obvious concept that you can't explain the ignorance and have the person come out looking good in any way.", "That was my take, beyond the fact that any destination wedding runs the risk of people not being able to, if the friend really valued the friendship she wouldn't put op in this position. \n\nshe wants the op to trash her plans and dreams just to stand in the audience and say 'yay'", "Especially because I feel like one of the unspoken rules of destination weddings is that you should count on less people attending because they can\u2019t come. Whether that\u2019s due to cost, PTO, childcare, or any number of other reasons - it\u2019s a much bigger deal to organize travel for a destination wedding than it is to pop over to the church for a local one. \n\nThen again, these types of people tend to think that the world revolves around them. So they can\u2019t comprehend that someone like OP wouldn\u2019t make the wedding her number 1 priority", "Seriously, I thought the point of a destination wedding was so fewer people would come.", "Well said. Also if Sarah values people\u2019s attendance, she could have chosen a less expensive location \u2014 like not a destination wedding.", "It's possible Sarah gets a better deal at the hotel the more wedding guests she brings in.", "If Sarah wants OP at the wedding so badly, then she can pay for/chip in on the expenses herself. I would think that would be a part of the budget for destination weddings if the couple really wants everyone to be there.

If she really wants her friend to attend she will cover some costs. NTA OP.", "I always figured that was part of the point of a destination wedding: to reduce the crowd of people attending. Now a days,  though,  the bride wants both the destination and the crowd.

That should be enough too!  The rest is selfishness on the part of the bride.  Don\u2019t feel guilty and don\u2019t enable it.", "I was going to make a similar comment! My friend of about 15 years got married at a destination wedding and it cost us a similar amount. Nearly $1,000 for roundtrip flights per person and her resort was $400/night. You'd pretty much need to stay 2 nights due to the timing of flights. So that was around $3,000 for us to attend as a couple! \n\nWe turned it into the biggest vacation we've taken since the pandemic in order to justify the costs (and used credit card points for our second, much cheaper hotel!).\n\nMy friend was incredibly grateful that I was able to attend, but would have totally understood if I couldn't make it.", ">insist that their wedding day is the most important day in the universe\n\nA clear case of [Main Character Syndrome](https://aislesoflife.com/2021/11/03/signs-of-main-character-syndrome/).", "They\u2019re not selfish.\nHowever, they should be aware before deciding on one - can the people I most want to be there make it?
