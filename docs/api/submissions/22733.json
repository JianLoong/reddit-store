Destination weddings are ok as long as the couple isn't mad at people for not attending.", "NTA. \n\nNo one has to \"sacrifice\" to support their friend's wedding. \n\nWhen I get a wedding invitation, I look at my calendar and my finances and decide if I can make it. Of course for people I am close to, I move things around, save a little money here, whatever I need to so I can make it work. But that isn't a sacrifice, just like being asked to go on vacation and having to take time off work and spend money isn't a sacrifice. \n\nIf you can't afford to go, you can't afford to go. You shouldn't be going in to debt or putting off your future for an event like this. Is Sarah going to spend the same amount of money on you to celebrate your \"special day\" when you buy a house? Doubtful. \n\nHer wedding is HER special day, and it is lovely to invite people to celebrate with you, and it is lovely to be able to celebrate with a couple. But, when you have a big event, some people can't make it for various reasons- work, competing event, travel- and when you make your wedding harder to attend with a destination that requires lots of people to travel, less people can make it. That's just how it is. \n\nLet Sarah be distant. You can send a card/present and tell her you still want to help out with anything you can, you simply cannot afford to go to her wedding AND pay your bills (she doesn't need to know about your savings account or other money, and she doesn't get an opinion on how you spend or save). This way, you are extending an olive branch AND being clear that you can't attend because you can't afford to. Now that you have been clear, it is up to her to make the next move.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m all for destination weddings but they have to come with the expectation that some people won\u2019t be able to make it due to the cost.

I have been to a couple and have always had a great time.

She\u2019s probably just hurt and not mad.", "When you choose to have a destination wedding, there should be NO OBLIGATION for anyone to attend.  It is a HUGE expense and it is unreasonable and selfish to expect/demand people attend.  We did it with my daughter (her choice) and I was very clear to everyone that I completely understood if they could not make it.  You should have to give no reasons for not attending.  It's a big ask.  \n\nThat being said, I'm not against destination weddings.  They are magical and wonderful to celebrate with the friends and family who are able to make the trip.  My point is it should be 100% their choice and there should be no guilt trip if people can not make it. \n\nNTA!", "NTA: If you plan a wedding with a big financial burden on your guest you have to live with most of them not comming.

I offered a possible solution and said you could always get married wherever you want but then have the reception back home after, if you wanted more of your friends and family to attend. I thought it was a good compromise since she seemed upset so many people would not be there. She didn\u2019t like my idea and said if people truly loved her they would be there.
