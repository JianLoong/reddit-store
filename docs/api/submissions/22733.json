Destination weddings are ok as long as the couple isn't mad at people for not attending.", "NTA. \n\nNo one has to \"sacrifice\" to support their friend's wedding. \n\nWhen I get a wedding invitation, I look at my calendar and my finances and decide if I can make it. Of course for people I am close to, I move things around, save a little money here, whatever I need to so I can make it work. But that isn't a sacrifice, just like being asked to go on vacation and having to take time off work and spend money isn't a sacrifice. \n\nIf you can't afford to go, you can't afford to go. You shouldn't be going in to debt or putting off your future for an event like this. Is Sarah going to spend the same amount of money on you to celebrate your \"special day\" when you buy a house? Doubtful. \n\nHer wedding is HER special day, and it is lovely to invite people to celebrate with you, and it is lovely to be able to celebrate with a couple. But, when you have a big event, some people can't make it for various reasons- work, competing event, travel- and when you make your wedding harder to attend with a destination that requires lots of people to travel, less people can make it. That's just how it is. \n\nLet Sarah be distant. You can send a card/present and tell her you still want to help out with anything you can, you simply cannot afford to go to her wedding AND pay your bills (she doesn't need to know about your savings account or other money, and she doesn't get an opinion on how you spend or save). This way, you are extending an olive branch AND being clear that you can't attend because you can't afford to. Now that you have been clear, it is up to her to make the next move.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m all for destination weddings but they have to come with the expectation that some people won\u2019t be able to make it due to the cost.

I have been to a couple and have always had a great time.

She\u2019s probably just hurt and not mad.", "When you choose to have a destination wedding, there should be NO OBLIGATION for anyone to attend.  It is a HUGE expense and it is unreasonable and selfish to expect/demand people attend.  We did it with my daughter (her choice) and I was very clear to everyone that I completely understood if they could not make it.  You should have to give no reasons for not attending.  It's a big ask.  \n\nThat being said, I'm not against destination weddings.  They are magical and wonderful to celebrate with the friends and family who are able to make the trip.  My point is it should be 100% their choice and there should be no guilt trip if people can not make it. \n\nNTA!", "NTA: If you plan a wedding with a big financial burden on your guest you have to live with most of them not comming.

I offered a possible solution and said you could always get married wherever you want but then have the reception back home after, if you wanted more of your friends and family to attend. I thought it was a good compromise since she seemed upset so many people would not be there. She didn\u2019t like my idea and said if people truly loved her they would be there.

My husband and I didn\u2019t do a destination wedding for this very reason- his side of the family wouldn\u2019t of been able to attend.", "It always floors me that people like Sarah epically fail to take into account the reality that others live in, and insist that their wedding day is the most important day in the universe. Yes, it's important to the bride and groom, but your attendance is not a measure of the value you place on the friendship.\n\nIt's not difficult to understand that you have personal goals and that spending a ton of money on a one-day event doesn't mesh with those goals. Her other friends have their own financial situations to deal with, but their finances have nothing to do with yours.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She chose a venue that is out of your financial reach (could does not mean should). If she ends the friendship over her own choices....I'm sorry. She really is asking too much of you.", "NTA. Avoid that situation", "NTA...She chose a destination wedding and those are expensive. Hotels flights food transportation. It's called a invitation for a reason. She wants you there that bad she can cover your expenses.", "NTA at all.  Your \"friend\" shouldn't expect people to go into financial ruin for her big day....if she wanted people there, she shouldn't have done a destination wedding.  You can't put yourself in a financial hole for someone else's big day.", "Sounds like your friend is trying to guilt and manipulate you into wasting all your hard earned money. This may be a good time to reevaluate your friendship to see if there have been other red flags that you may have previously missed", "Do not take on debt for someone else's wedding.", "NTA I'm engaged. We've had relatives say they can't afford to come. And we are fine with that. We aren't even having a fancy destination wedding, it's close to where we live. But some family would need to pay for 2 nights in a hotel as they live maybe a couple of hundred miles away. We knew some cousins don't have a well paid job and they don't go on holidays. So we weren't disappointed or surprised when some of them said they couldn't make it.", "She said it herself -other are making sacrifices to attend- that to me says it all she has no consideration of others so don't worry of she's upset it's not worth it, she'll come around when she needs you again and you get to decide if she's really your friend, that's usually how it works NTA", "NTA. \n\nYou aren't a terrible friend, however she sounds as though she's working on that title for herself.   Not everyone can afford to go to destination weddings and the cost all of that entails- this is just a given.  The expectation that you should do so at a detriment to your personal finances speaks volumes, not to mention the guilt trip you're being given for being a *responsible adult\\**", "NTA.  funny how she says your inconsiderate while she is expecting you to pay $$$$ to attend.", "NTA, when one has a destination wedding, one must be prepared that not everyone can afford to go. Your friend is being a bad friend by trying to guilt you into putting yourself at financial risk.", "NTA. If she NEEDS you there so badly why doesn't SHE pay for your trip?", "NTA if you plan a destination wedding, you have to either pay for guests to attend or expect only the rich ones to be able to afford to", "NTA.  This destination wedding trend is ludicrous.  It can put financial burdens on guests and wedding party members plus people not the bride and groom paying for it. \n\nRemind Sarah this is the 21st century and she should set up a livestream so people who can't easily afford to attend can share her day.", "NTA, if she was such a friend she would be sympathetic with your situation and accept that you have lots of demands on your money etc. I bet others are pushing themselves to afford it but not being as upfront as you.", "NTA. \n\nPersonally I think people who book destination weddings are AHs. They *know* that many people in their social circle won't be able to attend (mainly financial reasons, but also time constraints and other obligations) and it makes it all about them. (My feelings on weddings are that it is a *family* event - to be shared with and celebrated with family, much like a birthday or graduation) \n\nIf it were that important to Sarah to have you there, she'd pay some of your expenses to attend. If not, then she's just being entitled and expecting everyone to carve out a large chunk of money and time to see her wedding.", "If she wants you to be there this badly then let her pay for it", "So much this ^ \n\nPeople that have destination weddings need to realize that not everyone will be able to come and just accept it\n\nNTA", "In my experience people do destination weddings specifically so they have an excuse to not invite big crowds of people\u2026 OP\u2019s friend doesn\u2019t have the right to be upset that someone can\u2019t attend her wedding when she specifically chose to host it in a way that makes it difficult for people to attend.", "well spoken!", "Indeed. This situation says more about her priorities than OP\u2019s. NTA", "This.", "Exactly this. Any friend who wants you to take a financial baton to the knee to attend their wedding isn't a very good friend. If she really wanted certain people there she would either help pay for you to come or choose a location that wasn't financially crippling. NTA", "I always thought that was the point \ud83e\udd74 lol"]}
