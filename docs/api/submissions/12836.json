My elder brother (29M) also moved to the same country for his education a couple of years before me. He now has a well paying job here and has helped me a lot with the move. Our parents paid my brother\u2019s tuition fees as well as his living costs while he was studying as that\u2019s common in our culture. I got a full scholarship and a part-time job to take care of my other bills as soon as I moved so my parents didn\u2019t contribute anything. They did however pay for my flight ticket as that was quite expensive. \n\nI have a very rocky relationship with my parents, especially my father. He always favoured my brother and as a result, I was always treated differently than him. Being the youngest, I spent my entire life comparing myself to him and doing everything he did as I thought that\u2019s the only way to make my parents proud. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just plain old sexism or my brother being the first child, but nothing I did was enough. They always bought my brother expensive gifts and trips to celebrate his milestones but I got nothing even though I had better grades and got into better universities. They were also emotionally abusive and my father would say horrible things to me on a regular basis. My brother however, is an amazing person. He would stand-up for me and has always supported me. He\u2019s the only reason I still have a relationship with my parents and he\u2019s quite close to them. In our culture, it\u2019s also common to send money back to your parents especially if you\u2019re living abroad. My brother regularly sends money to our parents but has recently stopped as he got married and his wife doesn\u2019t have a job yet.\n\nI graduated last month and got a really well paying job. Now my parents are asking me to send them money but they\u2019re asking twice as much as my brother used to send. Their reasoning is that I\u2019m young and shouldn\u2019t have as much expenses as my brother did since I\u2019m not married. I\u2019m also earning more than my brother did. I straight up refused and told them I can\u2019t afford to send them  anything. Now they\u2019re calling me ungrateful and have got our extended family involved as well. Everyone\u2019s calling me an AH for abandoning my parents who have done so much for me. \n\nI feel like I don\u2019t owe them anything but they did pay for my flights and stuff and were contributing financially before I moved away. My brother has opted to stay out of it but has said that this will destroy my relationship with my parents so I should be prepared for that.

I happen to have fairly decent savings, which I made sure she won\u2018t get a penny of should anything happen to me.

But it sounds like NTA to me.", "NTA for the vote but kind of an AH. They did pay for your flight and some financial contribution of some kind before you moved. Leaving aside the emotional abuse and sexism and whatever else, since that can't be quantified easily, you owe them something small. \n\nIMO make your choice between paying them a little every month (I would say 1/10 of what he was sending them) or just paying back the flight and going NC after. Either way there's going to be friction after, but honestly, you're screwed no matter what you do.
