When I was a kid she was abusive and was doing drugs. She got caught and was in and out of prison until I was about 18 years old. So she was never there. We recently when I was about 21 began to talk again and she apologized for everything she did and I decided to give her a chance because I don\u2019t have any other family. Well recently she keeps asking to borrow money from me, and I was trying to be nice and help her. But recently on my birthday she texted me asking to borrow money but never said happy birthday or anything. So I got angry and told her no, and she told me she needed it to help with her bills. I still refused and haven\u2019t talked to her for about a week now. Some of my friends are saying I should have just helped because she\u2019s my mom and she\u2019s apologized for what she did to me growing up, but my other friends say that it was good of me to hold my ground and that she never took care of me and I don\u2019t owe her anything. I\u2019m just not sure if I was in the wrong here or not. Part of me thinks that I have every right to say no considering she didn\u2019t even take care of me when I was a kid.
