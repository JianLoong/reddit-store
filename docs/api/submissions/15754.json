It makes sense to be severely upset to be used as a punishment for your daughter, but your real concern should be why that even feels like an option. If your ex is punishing her they clearly aren\u2019t on the best terms right now and still you as the mother seem to be the significantly worse parent in her eyes. That\u2019s unfortunate, but due to her age I would say it\u2019s definitely something that you are doing to her. Please take a long time to self-reflect! If you truly feel you aren\u2019t doing anything wrong at all, you might need to look into what your ex is making her believe about you.", "NTA.

Mainly, how absolutely out of order for your ex to weaponise your relationship with your daughter. But perhaps with hindsight you could have used the time as an opportunity to spend time and bond with your daughter and help her see time with you as special, instead of her feeling unwanted by everyone. I don't think you're an asshole for not wanting your relationship with your daughter to be part of a punishment but feel you could have used a week of time with her to help her reach a place where she can't wait to come and spend time with her Mum which I'd think would be a priority", "ETA\n\nFor not getting a therapist for yourself and your daughter to mend your relationship.\n\nLook into parental alienation.

You absolutely could have handled it better, and you should recognize that you were probably too angry and loud with how you handled it.

Ex was way out of line using you as a punishment for your kid's behavior, regardless what she did. You're to blame because you evidently aren't in your daughter's life enough to be able to do and say things that can counteract whatever horrible things he's clearly telling her about you. We know he's telling her horrible things about you just from the fact that her staying there for a week is the worst possible punishment that can be given, not only in ex's mind but for your daughter as well. Perhaps you should've been more active in your daughter's life instead of shipping her off to Dad and washing your hands of the responsibility. Your daughter has only known whatever life she's had with dad, for the most part. She's had a life of lopsided influence where you were made out to be the Boogeyman in the closet, yet you did nothing to dispel that image for her.", "If YTA or NTA shouldn't make a difference. You and your x are definitely assholes using your child. You could have actually changed your child's perception but you missed it. Money isn't everything and I guess you need to grow as a parent to learn it.", "ESH\n\nThat was an awful thing your ex did - sending your daughter to you as punishment.\n\nYou demanding he take her back was also awful. Why not take the opportunity to try to build your relationship? You have a golden opportunity to make the week great, and you passed it up.", "ESH\nYour ex obviously sucks. \nHowever, I would ask yourself why your daughter views it as a punishment. It might simply be a case of parental alienation by your ex, however i question your decision to demand your ex takes her back. Since you have her during this time, why not take the opportunity to do something fun with her and create a bond. Sending her back isn't going to improve your relationship. Seems like both of you are just using your daughter in some warped power plays.", "NTA but I'm not sure you handled this in the best way. Kiddo might feel neither of you wants her now. Make it up to her by spoiling her a bit, maybe movie night with ice cream and pizza or something? Doesn't have to be expensive, just quality time.", "Okay so a couple of things. Usually (well in my country) the court is in favor of the mum having custody. As off age 12 they can decide where they want to stay. Secondly.  Why is it a punishment for your daughter to stay with you? Thirdly, after hearing what your daughter said to her dad why the hell did you insist on him taking her back instead of addressing the situation and finding out why she didn\u2019t want to be with you in the fist place? YTA. If you want a relationship with your child do better.", "If the father has more money than you he would be paying you child support to even the playing field. Him being wealthier isn't the issue, it's just a convenient excuse for you. You don't need to post what the real issue is between you and your daughter but that is what you should be working on. This 1 week punishment thing is just a symptom of the real issue.", "YTA for not putting more detail in your title lol", "YTA - You aren't the AH for getting upset he only sent her over as punishment and yelling at him but you are an AH for sending her back. This gives me the impression you don't really want to spend time with your daughter. This sends a message to your daughter that time with her is less important than getting back at her dad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA for so many other things including forcing your 11 year old to share a room with toddlers. Toddlers are not easy to share a room with. If she really only comes over once a month or two then how hard would it to have the toddlers sleep in your room while she visits. ( oh but I am guessing you don't really want to sleep in the same room as toddlers either but expect an 11 year old to just accept it). I can't imagine having a mom who forces me to eat foods I can't eat or really don't like the taste/texture of. Even if you are really lazy its not that hard to find microwaveable/easy to fix food that your daughter would like and make that for her while making your toddlers something different. It's a no wonder your daughter is a \"daddy's girl\" as you called her. He probably doesn't force her to eat food she doesn't like and show other kids that they are a priority over her.", "I was thinking N TA but after reading your replies, I would view staying in your house as punishment as well.\n\nYTA for not at least not attempting to meet your daughters needs.

Seven days spent with a mother who has significantly fewer financial resources, other children she's responsible for, and likely work and other responsibilities, is hardly going to magically fix this, no matter how much \"quality time\" she spends with a kid who is going to be resistant to the whole thing because she thinks she's being punished.\n\nThe only way this relationship is being repaired is with therapy, with a professional, and like YEARS of it.", "Seeing her 6-12 times a year barely qualifies as being a parent.", "I read through some of OP's comments.

Why does she see her once a month, is she financially unstable and has to make what she has? I\u2019m not standing up for her by any means, because it seems her daughter extremely dislikes her, but we have little to no information. The father shouldn\u2019t be portraying her mother in that manner to their child, he\u2019s a grown adult. Not saying he needs to praise her, but he shouldn\u2019t be using her parent as a fear tactic?", "Yes I also think that she's not acting ok with her daughter, but in the post she asks if she's being TA with his ex husband, which she's not.\nBut yeah you're right in that she shouldn't tell him to pick her up, she should try to give her a good time, but still NTA", "Yeah I think this is where I'm at, this needs to be addressed but on the spot is not the time to do it. Nothing will be solved when it's actively framed as punishment.", "She thinks I shouldn't make things she doesn't like when she is here but what am I supposed to do?

She acts like its such a huge difficult task to microwave a frozen pizza or throw one in the oven and heat up something different for her other kids.

Just because they\u2019re picky doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t eat food they dislike once in a while? \n\nWhat are you suppose to do? Be fair. Make food your daughter likes at least half the time. Let your 2 other kids deal with eating food they dislike. \n\nAlso, 1 room for 3 kids hardly seems fair.

It wouldn\u2019t kill your picky kids either to be fed foods that their half sibling enjoyed when she is there once every couple of months.

So, she doesn't like eggs and you cook eggs for all the other kids all the time?", "YTA and its sad you can't see it. Imagine someone forcing you to eat foods you don't like. Just because she is 11 doesn't mean she should be forced to eat foods she doesn't like. I hate black licorice, pinapple on pizza, and steamed brussel sprouts with no seasoning or butter. I can't imagine someone trying to force me to eat any of those. I would rather starve. \n\nNo wonder your daughter hates spending any time with you.
