It teaches them that people with chronic illness are liars and that it's okay to make fun of people that are ill. \n\nFamily therapy is probably a good idea.

You aren't tired because you want to be, and he needs to learn to understand and accept your limitations.\n\nI'd have a talk with him when you are both calm and explain why it was frustrating for you and ask what his intention was.
