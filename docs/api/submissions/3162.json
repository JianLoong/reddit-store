Why is your daughter so upset about you dating her dad? That is not a good reaction. You say that you were worried you\u2019d get their hopes up, but it sounds like your daughter doesn\u2019t even want you two dating. That is a red flag that needs to be addressed. Ask your daughter why she hates this idea and see about possibly getting her therapy for whatever is causing it. One way or another, you need to know why this is affecting her.~~\n\n~~Also talk to your son. He may know something you don\u2019t. And let them both know that no matter what they say, they will not get into trouble and you will not hate them and nothing bad will happen to you or them. I worry that your ex is hiding something from you, that they know about and have been warned not to say anything\u2026. Whether that\u2019s someone else he\u2019s dating or abuse or something else, I don\u2019t know. But it is very concerning.~~\n\n**ETA:** After seeing that your daughter is worried about you leaving when her dad has to travel, I feel much better.
