As an autistic adult with an autistic child and as someone with knowledge of elopement behaviors, I cannot applaud you and thank you enough for creating a reliable, safe space for Emily.  What your family does not understand, is that Emily trusts you and that trust is fragile. You have given Emily a way to feel safe (and actually be safe) when she's overwhelmed. Moving the safe space that belongs to her would have likely damaged her relationship with that space and with you.  Allowing others to be in the space would have eroded its status as sanctuary.  I know a lot of people will not understand this, but I do. What you did is significant for that child.  I'm so glad she has you.", "NTA if your siblings aren't willing to teach their kids about special needs and how to be compassionate about it, that's absolutely not your problem. Shame on your parents for not understanding also", "Wow, first of all: your parents want to host the holidays so \u201cEmily won\u2019t have the tent\u201d. So they just want to take her safe space away like that? That\u2019s- yikes. \n\nAnd, no, NTA. These people need to teach their kids what boundaries are, and if that\u2019s too difficult, make them handle disappointment better. Because, let\u2019s be honest here, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of toys they\u2019re gonna see and wanna play with but they won\u2019t be able to be because they\u2019re not theirs. \n\nThis is not something for you (OP) to deal with, but the parents of the other kids. It doesn\u2019t say in your post how the kids responded to this though. Was it even an issue for them after you explained and set the rules about the tent?", "NTA, the kids can be forgiven for being a little upset about being \"teased\" with a bunch of toys right in plain sight, as they're perhaps not old enough to understand. The grown adults on the other hand have no excuse and shame on them for being so selfish!", "Absolutely, 100%, totally NTA!!!\n\nSo furious at the relatives.

Your house, your rules. I was prepared to judge otherwise based on the title, but the tent is a reasonable solution given your foster child's needs. I understand the temptation it represents, but for your siblings to leave because of it? That's nuts.", "NTA. you're a great foster parent, and your nephews won't die from hearing no, it's JUST a tent. You explained the reasons why they weren't allowed in it, and they're completely reasonable. It's Emily's safe space and your main concern is her safety. They should understand this and your siblings should have helped make your nephews understand bc they're the adults here. They seem entitled brats who can't hear no for an answer.", "NTA. Emily has special needs that need accommodating and you have found a way to do it and keep her safe. The other kids had plenty of other toys to choose from and their parents should have backed you up. The only thing I would suggest, if there is room and not an inconvenience, set up another tent away from Emily's for the rest to play in. Emily keeps her safe space and they can play in their tent.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing a great job catering to Emily\u2019s needs.

It was not an option to hide away Emily\u2019s safe space when she was clearly going to be in a situation where would be needed for some quiet rest and her toys weren\u2019t collectibles placed at the eye level of children with curious eyes, but a vital part of Emily\u2019s feelings of comfort and safety in her home. You did well guarding those feelings for her. All kids have to learn to respect boundaries at some point, and while more nuanced boundaries such as \u201csome toys are for sharing and some aren\u2019t for you to touch\u201d can be tougher, this was absolutely a situation that warranted the effort to explain it as many times in a single day as it took to protect Emily. Definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for standing your ground and defending your daughter's safe space.", "NTA. Your family really doesn't have any idea what is involved in fostering a child with special needs do they? \nShame on them, their lack of empathy is showing!\nAnd thank you for looking after your foster child's well being! Don't be bullied or harassed, this little girl needs a safe place, and you are awesome for providing it for her!", "NTA ! How amazing that you are creating a safe safe for a child in need. Some people do not and will not understand the special care needed for children from difficult situations. You are doing an amazing job. You were right to force respect for the tent. It\u2019s not a playhouse, it\u2019s a safe space with a purpose. Keep it up. \n\nFor anyone wanting more information about how to interact with children in foster care, I\u2019d recommend the Instagram account \u201cfoster.parenting\u201d (not my account, just a good one, and sorry don\u2019t know how to link it).", "NTA \n\nAnd THANK YOU for being a good foster parent that cares about the needs of the kids.", "NTA.

The tent is a great way to teach kids about boundaries, it is a really simple way to make it make sense to kids.", "NTA. Kids need healthy boundaries and should be ok with being told \"no\" by that age.", "NTA.  In fact, you are the hero of this story.  Your family really needs to learn about interpersonal boundaries.  Good for you for looking out for Emily.", "NTA the tent is not a toy, it is a tool to help a young girl feel safe in a safe way. I am horrified at the guests at your home with their 'my kid is being denied' attitude instead of caring for a young person with special requirements - if it were me, i would have explained to my child that 'the tent is not a toy, off limits'. Maybe if you do host a gathering in the future you could provide a separate tent for the other kids?", "NTA.  Where do you live, Hell?  Otherwise I can't see how you managed to find so many people who'd be jealous of a 6 year old and her tent.\n\nIf you genuinely explained to the siblings what you wrote here about Emily's needs etc., and they're still moaning, I don't know what to do.  Maybe install an adult-size tent for them to go into when the realities of the world overwhelm them...", "NTA - thank you for being such a caring foster parent and giving emily a safe space. it\u2019s not your fault that your parents and siblings don\u2019t understand. it\u2019s her space, not anyone else\u2019s, and i\u2019m glad you held your ground for her until the end", "NTA you Saint.", "NTA. Maybe teach your family what her conditiona are exactly and how they affect her, but I fear it is better to just protect her and just keep the inconsiderate family members far away.", "NTA, this is really lovely.", "NTA. Unless these kids were all under 3 years old, they can understand that different people have different needs and that Emily needs the tent of toys that others don\u2019t touch. I\u2019m a teacher in an inclusion classroom, and I have found that kids are actually really good at understanding this kind of thing if explained to them. Plus, it sounds like the grownups were the ones throwing tantrums.", "NTA. You gave a neurodivergent child a place to feel safe. You stood your ground. Your siblings and parents may be upset, but Emily will remember this for a long time. She will remember that someone stood up for her and cares about her in a world that constantly tells her she's not cared about.", "How self absorbed are these people who feel so entitled to other people's belongings like that? I don't mean to speak ill of your family but how do they not understand they don't have a right to anything or toy she owns.\n\nNta", "NTA. When you take your kids to someone else\u2019s house the kids should be expected to abide by the rules of that house. It\u2019s a simple concept. Your family unfortunately are being TA\u2019s and are teaching their kids bad habits. Kudos to you for standing up for your foster child!", "NTA. Emily's NEEDS outweigh the WANTS of the other kids and their parents.  \n\nMaybe if the other parents used the word \"no\" occasionally, their kids would understand its meaning.", "NTA.", "NTA, I teach my kids to respect others\u2019 space and belongings. My 3 yr old understands this, even if he wouldn\u2019t have been happy about it. This situation is no different than not just walking into someone else\u2019s room and going through their things. If your siblings aren\u2019t teaching their children that they\u2019re not entitled to everything they see or want (especially if it belongs to someone else), then that\u2019s not your fault. Also, that little girl needs someone who is willing to advocate for her and her needs, so it\u2019s sounds like that\u2019s exactly what you were doing.", "NTA and I'm glad you stuck to your guns. The other parents need to be versed on how it can be for kids with special needs. This is a them problem and their kids need to learn to respect people's private spaces.", "NTA. The only critique I might have is that you could have given your sibs a heads up about the tent so they could take some time to talk about medical equipment and how we don't get to ride in someone's wheelchair or go in Emily's tent.", "NTA but everyone trying to ruin a child with special needs safe space are 100% AHs.  Especially when it was explained why and without it is causes a dangers situation.  I bet they just leave their homes door wide open for strangers to come in a use all their belongings right?  That is what this is equivalent to in the eyes for that little girl.  They can get over themselves and their spoiled children who apparently cannot be told no or to respect boundaries.  For the future it is probably best that they not come to your home to begin with as they feel entitled to just take over and cause potential psychological harm to a person who is extra delicate in that regard.", "So, if your nieces and nephews are out and about, and they see a kid in a wheelchair, and they think that looks cool, do they tell their parents, I want that wheelchair, and your siblings then tell the kid to give up his or her wheelchair because it\u2019s just not fair that their little darlings can\u2019t play with it? Or a kid with crutches???\n\nWhy am I thinking of Willy Wonka right now? Oh, yeah \u2014 that movie was about a bunch of enabled selfish little children who were, ultimately, taught some uncomfortable lessons. \n\nKids need boundaries. Being guided about what to do and what NOT to do in this world is Parenting 101 because it allows the species to survive AND because it shows children that we love and care about them. We not only want them to thrive, we want them to be properly socialized, which also helps their chances of survival. Failing to do this results in selfish twits that no one wants to be around. (I bet if you talked to those kids\u2019 teachers, you\u2019d learn that their parents are total pains.)\n\nNTA, x 1 billion. And kudos to you for not only fostering but for stepping up and being and providing Emily\u2019s safe space. You are making an enormous positive impact on her life.", "NTA.\n\nGood job looking out for the children in your care, and for fostering a special needs child. \n\nYour siblings could look at this as an opportunity to teach their children about respecting people's boundaries, especially as a guest in someone's home, and about respecting children with special needs. The fact that they are whining about the situation instead is why this answer isn't a NAH.", "NTA. This is no different than if you visit someone's house who has Lego sets on display or a collection of dolls/figures and kids who visit are told they aren't for them, don't touch. I raised 3 boys and wouldn't have had a problem with your setup. Kids need to learn no at an early age, if they are, situations like this aren't an issue. Your nieces/nephews sound spoiled.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA because as the foster parent, I think you have to put Emily and her safety first. Not sure if you really should have been hosting a bunch of people when you have Emily, who is easily overwhelmed and easily scared, living there but I\u2019m not voting on that point", "NTA. Your siblings should be teaching their children about special needs and having compassion instead of complaining to you because their kids whined about not getting to play in the tent. Your sins and parents are assholes and determined to pass that on to the newest generation.", "NTA. What a missed opportunity for your extended family to show some compassion (at Christmas, of all times) and for your siblings to talk with their kids about how sometimes different needs have to be respected. You sound like an amazing foster family to Emily.", "NTA.\n\nYou made accomodations for a special needs child. Private spaces should be respected. Was it annoying for everyone else, definitely. Kids will be kids and they will want what they can't have. I'm sure your siblings were just annoyed at having to deal with their kids whining. I have 2 kids and I would also be annoyed but I would also understand the situation. It's not my house, so it's not my rules. If I don't like it I can just leave. Your family's attitude sucks especially after you explained the situation. The only thing I can think of that you should have done was tell your siblings about the tent BEFORE they arrived so they could have prepared their kids.", "NTA", "Why are ppl rasing entitled kids that cannot be told no ? Why is it rude ? You are doing the right thing , she's so lucky to have you .", "Why can\u2019t we ride in Emily\u2019s wheelchair\u2026..\n\nGood life lesson for those other kids\u2026.", "NTA \n\nYou made a smart move, your family is being ridiculous.", "What ever happened to guests honoring the boundaries set by hosts and being a good guest?\n\nNTA!!\n\nWhy should the parents feel that their children are entitled to touch, use or play with anything and everything in your home? Tempting or not?  \n\nYou explained what the tent was for - it wasn't a toy or to be used as one, it is a therapy & safety device for Emily.  You were not \"taunting\" them with it.  It is pretty sad that the parents (yours and the other children's) could NOT understand that.  I suppose you could have moved it from the area where it wouldn't have been as noticeable during the event, but that would have been defeating the purpose of it for Emily and she is the priority here - not some kids disappointed they couldn't play with ONE THING. \n\nThe parents issue is that their precious angle was told \"NO\" and they had to 'deal' with the fallout of their kids wanting to play with something that was off limits to them.  It's a lot harder to tell a kid NO and actually PARENT a child and deal with the consequences than it is to just let the little one do whatever they want. \n\nYeah, sorry but your family kinda sucks and if it was one of their kids that needed a 'safe area' to decompress you better believe that they would be telling people not to touch it. \n\nIf they don't want you hosting anymore I would be careful of how they treat Emily when you go to their homes, I am betting they will tell their little angels not to let Emily play with this or that while there.   Good luck.", "NTA. \n\nNo means no. Their kids are not hurting by hearing it.", "NTA. The only thing I can think of is that it would probably have been helpful if everyone knew about Emily\u2019s needs and boundaries before the event so they could have prepared their kids. On the other hand, if they\u2019re still feeling wounded by them after the fact, maybe they simply aren\u2019t willing to accept that Emily needs her tent more than they need to be free from having to tell their kids no at a party.", "NTA my son is autistic and when he was younger we had a tent in the corner of our living room that was a \u2018time out\u2019 space (just to clarify time out was never a punishment it was used when one of my children wanted to have alone time). The rule was if he went in the tent no one was allowed to disturb him. It was important for him to have a safe space where he could go to calm himself when he was getting overwhelmed. \n\nMy younger son had to learn to accept this as did my nieces and nephews when they visited. It was one of the rules of the house, like don\u2019t grab the dog or jump on the furniture. It is good for children to learn to respect other\u2019s boundaries and to recognise that what they want doesn\u2019t override what other\u2019s need.", "NTA. \n\nYour siblings are acting entitled because they didn\u2019t want to tell their kids no, or explain to them that Emily needs a safe space. I guarantee if it was one of their children they would insist on accommodations. \n\nThank heavens Emily has someone like you looking out for her!", "NTA\n\nI see the utility of the tent. I see the utility of the rules in place. I also see why it caused problems with other kids the in family that made the holiday not-so-enjoyable for their parents. Logical argument & explanations don't necessarily make a kid feel any different.\n\nThey're TA for berating you, but I do think the solution of other people hosting is a good one. This set up clearly didn't work well.", "NTA , a lottttt of parent need to start parenting their kids. They need to understand that they aren\u2019t always going to get what they want just because they want it", "NTA\n\nThe fact the adults are more than willing to disrespect a small child's boundaries and potentially but her in danger all so their kids don't feel disappointed is gross.", "NTA you didn't elaborate but seeing you're fostering Emily she likely has suffered some trauma and giving her the tent is giving her the space she needs. I think it's a great and fun idea for her personally.\n\nIt's really sad that your family doesn't understand that Emily has some special needs and needs some accommodations.  You did all the right things here. \n\nMaybe next time they come over (if you even allow them to- NTA if you don't invite them until Emily doesn't need the tent anymore etc) could you get another tent for the kids?

Don't doubt yourself. You know what's best for your kids.", "NTA- How DARE you make your siblings parents their own children. \u201cThat tent is Emily\u2019s special safe space. She has toys in their because they are special to her. Emily gets to decide who goes in her tent.\u201d That is all your siblings had to say. A 3 year-old who isn\u2019t a brat can understand that logic.", "NTA - the fact that adults can\u2019t understand this situation and be empathic makes them the AH", "NTA. Your siblings and parents were looking for a fight or they\u2019re simply devoid of compassion and empathy. They\u2019re behavior was immature and mean spirited. \n\nYou and your husband are awesome foster parents!", "NTA\nThank you for fostering her and dealing with her issues. Foster kids have delt with alot of unthinkable things.\nYour extended family is full of selfishness and obviously don't realize they are blessed .", "Wait so you have the tent in view 24/7 and your 12 and 9 year old (and your older kids) can ignore it living there but your nieces and nephews visiting for a few hours can't ignore it. Do you siblings understand that implication? As the oldest cousin helping watch the littles the only time when I had to put away things is if the child is not taught to respect others property, or understand the words no. NTA.", "NTA it's for medical purposes and adults should know better.  There kids won't be traumatized over not having toys to play with that aren't there's to begin with.", "Thank god Emily has you! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\nNTA", "NTA, and if your parents want to host in the future I hope you will only attend if you can have a safe space set up for Emily.", "NTA my 5 year old is very protective of his belongings and I have a niece who destroys EVERYTHING. She is not allowed to use any of his things and her mom just rolls her eyes at me or makes comments under her breath. You\u2019re the parent and it\u2019s your home NO MEANS NO", "NTA. If my parents had made the slightest attempt to help me feel less overwhelmed as an autistic child, maybe I\u2019d still talk to them.", "nta- good on you for providing that space for emily", "Wow NTA you're amazing foster parents.\n\nKeep doing what you are doing.", "Special place for a special-needs kid, that is hers alone even when other kids visit?\n\nYep. Perfect. You are nailing this foster-parent job (and probably the bio-parent job, too).  NTA.\n\nThe only thing I can possibly think of that might have prevented the fuss over it is to have educated your family ahead of time on Emily's needs, and to have reminded your siblings, before Christmas, that Emily truly needs her private bolt-hole. It's not a matter of denying your niblings the special place, it's a very serious matter of maintaining Emily's emotional health. Are your siblings just not familiar with her issues and best practices for parenting her, or are they deliberately ignorant? I can see how you might not want to discuss the reasons for her needing the tent, in order to keep her history private, but it does kinda strike me that it was ultimately unhelpful to not prepare everyone before the get-together.\n\nYou DID have other stuff for the niblings to play with, if I'm reading right.", "NTA, you are supporting your foster child wonderfully, and the other kids have plenty to play with and don't need to encroach on Emily's safe place. These parents need to teach their children compassion and boundaries instead of  simply leaving in a huff.", "NTA.  If you want to keep hosting, why not have a holiday tent that is in the same room that also has toys, but is open to all?", "NTA - this is a brilliant and more importantly caring and compassionate thing to do for your foster daughter.      \nThere are so many horrible stories about foster care it\u2019s wonderful to hear a great one.     \nYour family are AHs and their kids need to learn that you can\u2019t have everything or do everything you want.", "NTA. The tent is the same as a bedroom, if you\u2019re not invited you can\u2019t go in.\n\nChildren also need to be taught that they can\u2019t do whatever they want by being told \u2018no\u2019 sometimes.", "NTA! You are creating trust with Emily. Demonstrating that adults can be trusted, that Emily can set boundries that will be respected by adults and that those boundries will be protected by her adults. Thank you for taking such good care of a child who has most certainly suffered in her very short life.", "NTA your family kinda sucks. You prioritize the safety and wellbeing of the child in your care. You rock!", "NTA. \nAre the parents going to get mad when the kids aren't allowed to drink a glass of wine they see an adult drinking? Or not allowed to do something they see teenagers do that could hurt them? \n\nHonestly, it sounds like these kids are likely the bane of any teacher or daycare etc teachers day, every day. \n\nThey're also not going to make friends not understanding boundaries...or consent for that matter. \n\nBet their parents don't let them play with every adult or breakable thing in their own house, so how is this any different? \n\n\nPs. What you've set up for Emilie is absolutely wonderful, and she's really lucky to have such caring and compassionate caretakers.", "NTA, your siblings sound dense as fuck. You have taught their kids a valuable life lesson that they can't always get their own way, and you also protected Emily in the process so kudos to you for not giving in!!", "NTA - no question about it.", "NTA, your family suck. Emily clearly has a traumatic past bad enough to need a safe hideaway, their children can cope with not being allowed in the tent. Needs trump wants.", "NTA but your family need to either learn about trauma in children, or not come to Emily's home.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. Seems like your siblings could be more understanding of Emily\u2019s needs. It\u2019s also a good lesson for their kids that they can\u2019t just have or do anything they want in life.", "NTA\n\nSpecial needs is the same as any other illness, condition, disability, etc. If this is what Emily needs to function, its no different from a medication, ambulatory device, hearing aid, eyeglasses, etc. \n\nI can understand an older generation not understanding that a behavior can't be controlled with discipline but your siblings have young kids and are exposed to a wide range of kids at school, parks, etc.\n\nYour siblings should absolutely have been empathetic and respectful about the setup you have for Emily.\n\nShame on them.", "NTA, but your sibs and your parents sure are.  I'm glad Emily has you in her life.", "NAH, but this was a terrible idea.  You might as well have a pile of dog biscuits on a table and carefully explain to the visiting dogs that they\u2019re not allowed to ge up on the table and eat the biscuits, only a rover is allowed to do that.  If, as you say, it was unsafe to move the tent to a non-public space for a few hours, then you should not have been hosting an event with similarly aged children.", "NTA this is a great opportunity for all the kids to learn about special needs and tolerance and how to prioritize others needs over their desires. So healthy! This is great! Boundaries are hard to teach kids and this opportunity is perfect. The parents ought to be thanking you", "Absolutely NTA. Thank you for respecting her needs.\n\nSide note: a lot of disabled people are speaking out against the term \"special needs\" because it's infantilising and our needs aren't \"special\" :)", "NTA your siblings are teaching their kids that their own wants are more important than someone else\u2019s needs.", "NTA. Children are allowed to have things of their own and not share them unless they want to. The tent is HER place and she\u2019s under no obligation to allow her cousins in it. You did wonderful not pushing her and accepting Emily\u2019s decision.", "INFO \n\nDid you explain anything about this to your siblings before they showed up? \n\nHonestly, I think you did exactly right *for Emily and your household,* but you might be asshole-adjacent for not giving everyone outside your household a heads-up about an attractive nuisance in your living room. \n\nOh well, you can't unring that bell - unless you have a specially modified DeLorean - but you've learned something for the future: the best way to fix a problem is to avoid having it to begin with. \n\nAnother time, explain to your siblings in advance that there's a tent full of toys in your living room that no one is allowed to touch and ask them to do whatever they need to do to keep their kids away from it. \n\nAlso, good job taking care of Emily and making her needs your priority. That's the most important thing.", "NTA - And, also, WTF?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow in the world are two teenagers and a preteen jealous of a 6-year-old's safety tent? I could see the 9-year-old having impulse control issues, but it sounds like he's the only one who had empathy in the bunch. Bunch of entitled weirdos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmily is lucky to have people in her life who value her privacy and her trust. Keep it up!", "I think the tent in the living room is attracting other kids.   It would be different if in her room.  I would take my kid and leave, but not berate.", "Esh  \nIt was one night.  You could have put the tent in her room for the night.\nThose parents can get over them self.  It's just a tent not Disneyland", "Soft yta how old are your nieces and nephews ? Are you able to move the tent to her room? It is like taunting and although they can grow to understand that situation it seems rude to have her have a fun exciting place that only she can use in front of the other kids. Get rid of the locks on doors and have her go to a non-communal place.", "I loved your answer.\n\nOP,  I'm a teacher of students with SEND and I wanted to congratulate you for understanding Emily's needs and do not succumb to your family's tantrums.", "My dog has a potato brain and handles the word no better than these kids.", "Thank you for sharing this vital information! Have my free award for making me laugh. \ud83d\ude02", "My dog \u200b\u200bis good with people and will stay on his bed and mostly ignore everyone", "It\u2019s a simple concept. Your family unfortunately are being TA\u2019s and are teaching their kids bad habits", "Yeah parents are idiots. I'd be pretty clear that Emily in fact will have her tent, because me and the family will not be attending.", "Same here. I was ready to come yell at him from the title but after the first paragraph I was like YOU GO DUDE!!! lol", "It's both \"just\" a tent and NOT \"just\" a tent. It's not something the nephews NEED, but it is something Emily needs. Nephews (their parents, apparently) need to learn to respect boundaries.", "Right! One of the best aita I\u2019ve read in a while", "This is it, OP. This is the thing", ">Not sure if you really should have been hosting a bunch of people when you have Emily, who is easily overwhelmed and easily scared,\n\nOn the other hand, having people in the house will help socialize Emily.  Much harder to take her out of her comfort zone to work on those skills.\n\nIt's beyond me where the extended family gets the idea that kids who are visiting have a right to whatever they want in the house they are visiting.  Sounds like the visiting families didn't bring their own kids items to distract them.\n\nWouldn't it be nice if families just accepted the boundaries parents are using.", "Wait, are you trying to insinuate it might be wrong to unplug grandpa's respirator to charge my phone?  Why does he get to hog the tempting tempting electrical outlet?  This seems unfair that his \"special needs and considerations\" outstrip my need; this is a day about family.  God I hope I didn't need to point out my sarcasm.  NTA btw.", "The sense of entitlement here! Your family sucks and I'm sure part of it has to do with Emily not being \"real\" family. \n\nThis is a comprehensive answer. And a good reminder to keep an eye on how they treat her at future family gatherings held in their homes.  NTA.", "Or 3, The parents can teach their kids that no means no.", "Yes but it would\u2019ve been harder for us to keep an eye on Emily in the tent. With its current placement, I can see her in it from the living room, kitchen, dining room, and laundry room but if we move it to a more secluded place we would not be able to monitor her nearly as much.", "Or the children that are not disabled can be taught that they don't get everything that they want just because they want it when the thing they want is important and necessary for a disabled child... learning moment completely missed", "He said she would lock the door if the tent was put somewhere other than the living room, where there are no locks. The tent has a purpose and it's the parent's job to teach them why they can't get inside and a great opportunity to teach them some compassion and boundaries and why some kids have special needs.", "?? Why would you leave because your kid can't play with the one thing they were asked not to play with? It's not even like it was the only toy in the house. That sounds so entitled.", "Damn, I've been teaching special ed for 8 years (in the program before that for an additional 4 years) and never heard that term, had to look it up. Mine have behavioral disorders/learning disabilities but it's never come up in all my years!", "Right? My cat hears NO and she immediately stops and tries to figure out what the fuck she's doing wrong lol", "Maybe install an adult-size tent for them to go into when the realities of the world overwhelm them.", "Exactly what I said. It's JUST a tent TO THE NEPHEWS. not to Emily, obviously. They can live without going inside it.", "You can teach a kid that no means no, but if that kid is, say, 3, you're going to be in a perpetual fight all night with a kid who can't be redirected to something else because there are no other options for them. The only option for parents of kids who  are in the room with the tent full of toys is to take their kid and leave. For kids at certain developmental stages, this sort of thing is just setting them up for failure.", "You're NTA but do you need to keep an eye on Emily when she is in the tent? The way it seems to me is that the tent is the safe space and when she's in there you probably wouldn't need to be eyes on the whole time", "I think the tent in the living room is attractive to others.  If everyone else wants to do holidays elsewhere, thems the breaks.  It like when a pool is called an attractive nuisance, it can be expected to attract kids.", "Because  to put toys in the living room and expect other kids not to want to play with them is pushing it, and best to just avoid.  Grandparents see that too.  Everyone has the right to make choices.   It is like if you have a swimming pool and expecting kids not not to want to jump in.", "Which term? SEND? It stands for Special Educational Needs and Development. I teach in England, where do you teach? From what you said it sounds like you teach in the US.", "Just thought you might be interested in knowing that a lot of disabled people don't like the term special needs because our needs aren't \"special\" :) if you already knew then ignore me lol!", "really? My cat hears no and looks around to see who I am talking to because it can't possibly be her.", "Probably so she can do it again right. Lol", "This is a good answer. I would say if the kids are under 5 something like this is just going to be the attraction and will be nothing but an argument because of the developmental stages of the kids involved. Or leaves the parents constantly saying no for hours on end, which isn't enjoyable for anyone. \n\nI feel like I am the only person who would have simply bought a second tent/fort for the other kids to enjoy lol.", "It\u2019s helpful to be able to keep an eye on her. We know her being in the tent usually means something\u2019s wrong and sometimes we have to step in but we won\u2019t know if we can\u2019t see her.", "Again, an opportunity for the parents to sit with the children and explain that the tent is NOT a toy and serves a purpose (explain the purpose) and also the tent couldnt be moved from the living room so they could watch Emily at al times. If you raise kids right they will understand boundaries and why they should leave the tent alone, and go play with other toys since OP said they were available. They won't die from being kept away from a tent for a few hours.", "It doesn't matter if it's a pool or a pile of money, you don't just do whatever you want with it, especially when you've been explicitly asked not to, and you certainly don't get uppity about it either. It was already explained by OP and another commenter that there are safety reasons involved with the placement of the tent. It's not like she put it there out of spite. \n\nIt's on the parents to teach their children that they can't always have what they want. There were other things to do and play with, and absolutely no reason for the parents (as if they're the ones who wanted to play with the tent) to bitch and moan about it.", "Right? We don't know what age the other kids are. I have kids of my own. They're teens now, but I know that there would have been a massive difference between them at, say, age 8 vs. age 3.", "NTA. If your foster daughter had a wheelchair would she be expected to let other kids play with it because it's \"tempting them\"? The adults in the family need to do better about teaching equitable vs equal.", "Fair enough you would obviously know more about her needs than I. Your siblings suck for how they acted and it seems like there genuinely wasn't a whole lot of room for compromise", "And the parents may decide that the best way to keep their kids away from then tent is to not go to OPs house.  I suspect grandparents want to see all their kids at holidays.  Time will tell.\n\nYOu do not get to decide what other parents do.  They have the right to remove their kids from a situation.", "But you have the right to leave.  Not saying OP is the AH, but others ahve the right to leave.", "True. And also parents need to understand that not everything is available for their children in a house they visit just because they're children. They need to be taught boundaries. You're right when you say that the best way to keep the children away from the tent is not to go to the OPs house if you can't sit with your children and explain the reasons and those boundaries to them.", "You do not get to tell other parents how to parent.  As to boundaries, I tell my kids if they do not want to share, toys stay in their room.  Everyone has different standards.  I suspect the issue is the grandparents understand that the other siblings will just not to go OPs house.  Everyone has to make their own decision and live with it.", "If you don't want to hear other views on parenting, you should not be in this page. I'm giving you my view on how children should be taught boundaries. If you think they should be allowed to do whatever they want, it's your opinion. You can give yours and I can give mine. Simple as that."]}
