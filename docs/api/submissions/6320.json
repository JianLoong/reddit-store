As an autistic adult with an autistic child and as someone with knowledge of elopement behaviors, I cannot applaud you and thank you enough for creating a reliable, safe space for Emily.  What your family does not understand, is that Emily trusts you and that trust is fragile. You have given Emily a way to feel safe (and actually be safe) when she's overwhelmed. Moving the safe space that belongs to her would have likely damaged her relationship with that space and with you.  Allowing others to be in the space would have eroded its status as sanctuary.  I know a lot of people will not understand this, but I do. What you did is significant for that child.  I'm so glad she has you.", "NTA if your siblings aren't willing to teach their kids about special needs and how to be compassionate about it, that's absolutely not your problem. Shame on your parents for not understanding also", "Wow, first of all: your parents want to host the holidays so \u201cEmily won\u2019t have the tent\u201d. So they just want to take her safe space away like that? That\u2019s- yikes. \n\nAnd, no, NTA. These people need to teach their kids what boundaries are, and if that\u2019s too difficult, make them handle disappointment better. Because, let\u2019s be honest here, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of toys they\u2019re gonna see and wanna play with but they won\u2019t be able to be because they\u2019re not theirs. \n\nThis is not something for you (OP) to deal with, but the parents of the other kids. It doesn\u2019t say in your post how the kids responded to this though. Was it even an issue for them after you explained and set the rules about the tent?", "NTA, the kids can be forgiven for being a little upset about being \"teased\" with a bunch of toys right in plain sight, as they're perhaps not old enough to understand. The grown adults on the other hand have no excuse and shame on them for being so selfish!", "Absolutely, 100%, totally NTA!!!\n\nSo furious at the relatives.

Your house, your rules. I was prepared to judge otherwise based on the title, but the tent is a reasonable solution given your foster child's needs. I understand the temptation it represents, but for your siblings to leave because of it? That's nuts.", "NTA. you're a great foster parent, and your nephews won't die from hearing no, it's JUST a tent. You explained the reasons why they weren't allowed in it, and they're completely reasonable. It's Emily's safe space and your main concern is her safety. They should understand this and your siblings should have helped make your nephews understand bc they're the adults here. They seem entitled brats who can't hear no for an answer.", "NTA. Emily has special needs that need accommodating and you have found a way to do it and keep her safe. The other kids had plenty of other toys to choose from and their parents should have backed you up. The only thing I would suggest, if there is room and not an inconvenience, set up another tent away from Emily's for the rest to play in. Emily keeps her safe space and they can play in their tent.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing a great job catering to Emily\u2019s needs.

It was not an option to hide away Emily\u2019s safe space when she was clearly going to be in a situation where would be needed for some quiet rest and her toys weren\u2019t collectibles placed at the eye level of children with curious eyes, but a vital part of Emily\u2019s feelings of comfort and safety in her home. You did well guarding those feelings for her. All kids have to learn to respect boundaries at some point, and while more nuanced boundaries such as \u201csome toys are for sharing and some aren\u2019t for you to touch\u201d can be tougher, this was absolutely a situation that warranted the effort to explain it as many times in a single day as it took to protect Emily. Definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for standing your ground and defending your daughter's safe space.", "NTA. Your family really doesn't have any idea what is involved in fostering a child with special needs do they? \nShame on them, their lack of empathy is showing!\nAnd thank you for looking after your foster child's well being! Don't be bullied or harassed, this little girl needs a safe place, and you are awesome for providing it for her!", "NTA ! How amazing that you are creating a safe safe for a child in need. Some people do not and will not understand the special care needed for children from difficult situations. You are doing an amazing job. You were right to force respect for the tent. It\u2019s not a playhouse, it\u2019s a safe space with a purpose. Keep it up. \n\nFor anyone wanting more information about how to interact with children in foster care, I\u2019d recommend the Instagram account \u201cfoster.parenting\u201d (not my account, just a good one, and sorry don\u2019t know how to link it).", "NTA \n\nAnd THANK YOU for being a good foster parent that cares about the needs of the kids.", "NTA.

The tent is a great way to teach kids about boundaries, it is a really simple way to make it make sense to kids.", "NTA. Kids need healthy boundaries and should be ok with being told \"no\" by that age.", "NTA.  In fact, you are the hero of this story.  Your family really needs to learn about interpersonal boundaries.  Good for you for looking out for Emily.", "NTA the tent is not a toy, it is a tool to help a young girl feel safe in a safe way. I am horrified at the guests at your home with their 'my kid is being denied' attitude instead of caring for a young person with special requirements - if it were me, i would have explained to my child that 'the tent is not a toy, off limits'. Maybe if you do host a gathering in the future you could provide a separate tent for the other kids?", "NTA.  Where do you live, Hell?  Otherwise I can't see how you managed to find so many people who'd be jealous of a 6 year old and her tent.\n\nIf you genuinely explained to the siblings what you wrote here about Emily's needs etc., and they're still moaning, I don't know what to do.  Maybe install an adult-size tent for them to go into when the realities of the world overwhelm them...", "NTA - thank you for being such a caring foster parent and giving emily a safe space. it\u2019s not your fault that your parents and siblings don\u2019t understand. it\u2019s her space, not anyone else\u2019s, and i\u2019m glad you held your ground for her until the end", "NTA you Saint.", "NTA. Maybe teach your family what her conditiona are exactly and how they affect her, but I fear it is better to just protect her and just keep the inconsiderate family members far away.", "NTA, this is really lovely.", "NTA. Unless these kids were all under 3 years old, they can understand that different people have different needs and that Emily needs the tent of toys that others don\u2019t touch. I\u2019m a teacher in an inclusion classroom, and I have found that kids are actually really good at understanding this kind of thing if explained to them. Plus, it sounds like the grownups were the ones throwing tantrums.", "NTA. You gave a neurodivergent child a place to feel safe. You stood your ground. Your siblings and parents may be upset, but Emily will remember this for a long time. She will remember that someone stood up for her and cares about her in a world that constantly tells her she's not cared about.", "How self absorbed are these people who feel so entitled to other people's belongings like that? I don't mean to speak ill of your family but how do they not understand they don't have a right to anything or toy she owns.\n\nNta", "NTA. When you take your kids to someone else\u2019s house the kids should be expected to abide by the rules of that house. It\u2019s a simple concept. Your family unfortunately are being TA\u2019s and are teaching their kids bad habits. Kudos to you for standing up for your foster child!", "NTA. Emily's NEEDS outweigh the WANTS of the other kids and their parents.  \n\nMaybe if the other parents used the word \"no\" occasionally, their kids would understand its meaning.", "NTA.", "NTA, I teach my kids to respect others\u2019 space and belongings. My 3 yr old understands this, even if he wouldn\u2019t have been happy about it. This situation is no different than not just walking into someone else\u2019s room and going through their things. If your siblings aren\u2019t teaching their children that they\u2019re not entitled to everything they see or want (especially if it belongs to someone else), then that\u2019s not your fault. Also, that little girl needs someone who is willing to advocate for her and her needs, so it\u2019s sounds like that\u2019s exactly what you were doing.", "NTA and I'm glad you stuck to your guns. The other parents need to be versed on how it can be for kids with special needs. This is a them problem and their kids need to learn to respect people's private spaces.", "NTA. The only critique I might have is that you could have given your sibs a heads up about the tent so they could take some time to talk about medical equipment and how we don't get to ride in someone's wheelchair or go in Emily's tent.", "NTA but everyone trying to ruin a child with special needs safe space are 100% AHs.  Especially when it was explained why and without it is causes a dangers situation.  I bet they just leave their homes door wide open for strangers to come in a use all their belongings right?  That is what this is equivalent to in the eyes for that little girl.  They can get over themselves and their spoiled children who apparently cannot be told no or to respect boundaries.  For the future it is probably best that they not come to your home to begin with as they feel entitled to just take over and cause potential psychological harm to a person who is extra delicate in that regard.", "So, if your nieces and nephews are out and about, and they see a kid in a wheelchair, and they think that looks cool, do they tell their parents, I want that wheelchair, and your siblings then tell the kid to give up his or her wheelchair because it\u2019s just not fair that their little darlings can\u2019t play with it? Or a kid with crutches???\n\nWhy am I thinking of Willy Wonka right now? Oh, yeah \u2014 that movie was about a bunch of enabled selfish little children who were, ultimately, taught some uncomfortable lessons. \n\nKids need boundaries. Being guided about what to do and what NOT to do in this world is Parenting 101 because it allows the species to survive AND because it shows children that we love and care about them. We not only want them to thrive, we want them to be properly socialized, which also helps their chances of survival. Failing to do this results in selfish twits that no one wants to be around. (I bet if you talked to those kids\u2019 teachers, you\u2019d learn that their parents are total pains.)\n\nNTA, x 1 billion. And kudos to you for not only fostering but for stepping up and being and providing Emily\u2019s safe space. You are making an enormous positive impact on her life.", "NTA.\n\nGood job looking out for the children in your care, and for fostering a special needs child. \n\nYour siblings could look at this as an opportunity to teach their children about respecting people's boundaries, especially as a guest in someone's home, and about respecting children with special needs. The fact that they are whining about the situation instead is why this answer isn't a NAH.", "NTA. This is no different than if you visit someone's house who has Lego sets on display or a collection of dolls/figures and kids who visit are told they aren't for them, don't touch. I raised 3 boys and wouldn't have had a problem with your setup. Kids need to learn no at an early age, if they are, situations like this aren't an issue. Your nieces/nephews sound spoiled.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA because as the foster parent, I think you have to put Emily and her safety first. Not sure if you really should have been hosting a bunch of people when you have Emily, who is easily overwhelmed and easily scared, living there but I\u2019m not voting on that point", "NTA. Your siblings should be teaching their children about special needs and having compassion instead of complaining to you because their kids whined about not getting to play in the tent. Your sins and parents are assholes and determined to pass that on to the newest generation.", "NTA. What a missed opportunity for your extended family to show some compassion (at Christmas, of all times) and for your siblings to talk with their kids about how sometimes different needs have to be respected. You sound like an amazing foster family to Emily.", "NTA.\n\nYou made accomodations for a special needs child. Private spaces should be respected. Was it annoying for everyone else, definitely. Kids will be kids and they will want what they can't have. I'm sure your siblings were just annoyed at having to deal with their kids whining. I have 2 kids and I would also be annoyed but I would also understand the situation. It's not my house, so it's not my rules. If I don't like it I can just leave. Your family's attitude sucks especially after you explained the situation. The only thing I can think of that you should have done was tell your siblings about the tent BEFORE they arrived so they could have prepared their kids.", "NTA", "Why are ppl rasing entitled kids that cannot be told no ? Why is it rude ? You are doing the right thing , she's so lucky to have you .", "Why can\u2019t we ride in Emily\u2019s wheelchair\u2026..\n\nGood life lesson for those other kids\u2026.", "NTA \n\nYou made a smart move, your family is being ridiculous.", "What ever happened to guests honoring the boundaries set by hosts and being a good guest?\n\nNTA!!\n\nWhy should the parents feel that their children are entitled to touch, use or play with anything and everything in your home? Tempting or not?  \n\nYou explained what the tent was for - it wasn't a toy or to be used as one, it is a therapy & safety device for Emily.  You were not \"taunting\" them with it.  It is pretty sad that the parents (yours and the other children's) could NOT understand that.  I suppose you could have moved it from the area where it wouldn't have been as noticeable during the event, but that would have been defeating the purpose of it for Emily and she is the priority here - not some kids disappointed they couldn't play with ONE THING. \n\nThe parents issue is that their precious angle was told \"NO\" and they had to 'deal' with the fallout of their kids wanting to play with something that was off limits to them.  It's a lot harder to tell a kid NO and actually PARENT a child and deal with the consequences than it is to just let the little one do whatever they want. \n\nYeah, sorry but your family kinda sucks and if it was one of their kids that needed a 'safe area' to decompress you better believe that they would be telling people not to touch it. \n\nIf they don't want you hosting anymore I would be careful of how they treat Emily when you go to their homes, I am betting they will tell their little angels not to let Emily play with this or that while there.   Good luck.", "NTA. \n\nNo means no. Their kids are not hurting by hearing it.", "NTA. The only thing I can think of is that it would probably have been helpful if everyone knew about Emily\u2019s needs and boundaries before the event so they could have prepared their kids. On the other hand, if they\u2019re still feeling wounded by them after the fact, maybe they simply aren\u2019t willing to accept that Emily needs her tent more than they need to be free from having to tell their kids no at a party.", "NTA my son is autistic and when he was younger we had a tent in the corner of our living room that was a \u2018time out\u2019 space (just to clarify time out was never a punishment it was used when one of my children wanted to have alone time). The rule was if he went in the tent no one was allowed to disturb him. It was important for him to have a safe space where he could go to calm himself when he was getting overwhelmed. \n\nMy younger son had to learn to accept this as did my nieces and nephews when they visited. It was one of the rules of the house, like don\u2019t grab the dog or jump on the furniture. It is good for children to learn to respect other\u2019s boundaries and to recognise that what they want doesn\u2019t override what other\u2019s need.", "NTA. \n\nYour siblings are acting entitled because they didn\u2019t want to tell their kids no, or explain to them that Emily needs a safe space. I guarantee if it was one of their children they would insist on accommodations. \n\nThank heavens Emily has someone like you looking out for her!", "NTA\n\nI see the utility of the tent. I see the utility of the rules in place. I also see why it caused problems with other kids the in family that made the holiday not-so-enjoyable for their parents. Logical argument & explanations don't necessarily make a kid feel any different.\n\nThey're TA for berating you, but I do think the solution of other people hosting is a good one. This set up clearly didn't work well.", "NTA , a lottttt of parent need to start parenting their kids. They need to understand that they aren\u2019t always going to get what they want just because they want it", "NTA\n\nThe fact the adults are more than willing to disrespect a small child's boundaries and potentially but her in danger all so their kids don't feel disappointed is gross.", "NTA you didn't elaborate but seeing you're fostering Emily she likely has suffered some trauma and giving her the tent is giving her the space she needs. I think it's a great and fun idea for her personally.\n\nIt's really sad that your family doesn't understand that Emily has some special needs and needs some accommodations.  You did all the right things here. \n\nMaybe next time they come over (if you even allow them to- NTA if you don't invite them until Emily doesn't need the tent anymore etc) could you get another tent for the kids?

I used to nanny/babysit for a handful of families in one neighborhood who all had 4-5 yo kids. About once a week I\u2019d have all the kids at one house together so they could play and the parents could all have a few hours to do whatever and we\u2019d alternate which family\u2019s house hosted each week. Pretty early on I started implementing a rule similar to what you did with Emily. The kid whose house we\u2019d be at would gather up any toys they didn\u2019t want to share and they\u2019d be put away somewhere off limits. Anything left out was fair game. It helped minimizing fighting and gave the children a sense of independence and control over their belongings. All the parents were on board with this as well. \n\nAdditionally, we had a kid in the group who had autism. He only joined us when it was at his house or the neighbor directly across from him since those were the two places he was comfortable enough with, and at both houses he had a designated safe spot where he could go if he needed to. He also had a special firetruck that functioned as his security object and he always had it with him. All the other kids were made to understand that this one toy was not a sharing toy, that it was something he needed and was off limits even though it was \u201cout\u201d. They also learned that if he was in his special spot, he was to be left alone until he chose to rejoin them. I only had to correct one of the children once, because she didn\u2019t quite grasp that even if he put the firetruck down, it still wasn\u2019t to be touched. After that I never had a problem with the kids or parents. If a group of 4 and 5 year olds can understand the needs of one little boy outweighing their own desires, then your family has no excuse other than selfish ignorance.
