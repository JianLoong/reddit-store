As an autistic adult with an autistic child and as someone with knowledge of elopement behaviors, I cannot applaud you and thank you enough for creating a reliable, safe space for Emily.  What your family does not understand, is that Emily trusts you and that trust is fragile. You have given Emily a way to feel safe (and actually be safe) when she's overwhelmed. Moving the safe space that belongs to her would have likely damaged her relationship with that space and with you.  Allowing others to be in the space would have eroded its status as sanctuary.  I know a lot of people will not understand this, but I do. What you did is significant for that child.  I'm so glad she has you.", "NTA if your siblings aren't willing to teach their kids about special needs and how to be compassionate about it, that's absolutely not your problem. Shame on your parents for not understanding also", "Wow, first of all: your parents want to host the holidays so \u201cEmily won\u2019t have the tent\u201d. So they just want to take her safe space away like that? That\u2019s- yikes. \n\nAnd, no, NTA. These people need to teach their kids what boundaries are, and if that\u2019s too difficult, make them handle disappointment better. Because, let\u2019s be honest here, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of toys they\u2019re gonna see and wanna play with but they won\u2019t be able to be because they\u2019re not theirs. \n\nThis is not something for you (OP) to deal with, but the parents of the other kids. It doesn\u2019t say in your post how the kids responded to this though. Was it even an issue for them after you explained and set the rules about the tent?", "NTA, the kids can be forgiven for being a little upset about being \"teased\" with a bunch of toys right in plain sight, as they're perhaps not old enough to understand. The grown adults on the other hand have no excuse and shame on them for being so selfish!", "Absolutely, 100%, totally NTA!!!\n\nSo furious at the relatives.

Your house, your rules. I was prepared to judge otherwise based on the title, but the tent is a reasonable solution given your foster child's needs. I understand the temptation it represents, but for your siblings to leave because of it? That's nuts.", "NTA. you're a great foster parent, and your nephews won't die from hearing no, it's JUST a tent. You explained the reasons why they weren't allowed in it, and they're completely reasonable. It's Emily's safe space and your main concern is her safety. They should understand this and your siblings should have helped make your nephews understand bc they're the adults here. They seem entitled brats who can't hear no for an answer.", "NTA. Emily has special needs that need accommodating and you have found a way to do it and keep her safe. The other kids had plenty of other toys to choose from and their parents should have backed you up. The only thing I would suggest, if there is room and not an inconvenience, set up another tent away from Emily's for the rest to play in. Emily keeps her safe space and they can play in their tent.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing a great job catering to Emily\u2019s needs.

It was not an option to hide away Emily\u2019s safe space when she was clearly going to be in a situation where would be needed for some quiet rest and her toys weren\u2019t collectibles placed at the eye level of children with curious eyes, but a vital part of Emily\u2019s feelings of comfort and safety in her home. You did well guarding those feelings for her. All kids have to learn to respect boundaries at some point, and while more nuanced boundaries such as \u201csome toys are for sharing and some aren\u2019t for you to touch\u201d can be tougher, this was absolutely a situation that warranted the effort to explain it as many times in a single day as it took to protect Emily. Definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for standing your ground and defending your daughter's safe space.", "NTA. Your family really doesn't have any idea what is involved in fostering a child with special needs do they? \nShame on them, their lack of empathy is showing!\nAnd thank you for looking after your foster child's well being! Don't be bullied or harassed, this little girl needs a safe place, and you are awesome for providing it for her!", "NTA ! How amazing that you are creating a safe safe for a child in need. Some people do not and will not understand the special care needed for children from difficult situations. You are doing an amazing job. You were right to force respect for the tent. It\u2019s not a playhouse, it\u2019s a safe space with a purpose. Keep it up. \n\nFor anyone wanting more information about how to interact with children in foster care, I\u2019d recommend the Instagram account \u201cfoster.parenting\u201d (not my account, just a good one, and sorry don\u2019t know how to link it).", "NTA \n\nAnd THANK YOU for being a good foster parent that cares about the needs of the kids.", "NTA.

The tent is a great way to teach kids about boundaries, it is a really simple way to make it make sense to kids.", "NTA. Kids need healthy boundaries and should be ok with being told \"no\" by that age.", "NTA.  In fact, you are the hero of this story.  Your family really needs to learn about interpersonal boundaries.  Good for you for looking out for Emily.", "NTA the tent is not a toy, it is a tool to help a young girl feel safe in a safe way. I am horrified at the guests at your home with their 'my kid is being denied' attitude instead of caring for a young person with special requirements - if it were me, i would have explained to my child that 'the tent is not a toy, off limits'. Maybe if you do host a gathering in the future you could provide a separate tent for the other kids?", "NTA.  Where do you live, Hell?  Otherwise I can't see how you managed to find so many people who'd be jealous of a 6 year old and her tent.\n\nIf you genuinely explained to the siblings what you wrote here about Emily's needs etc., and they're still moaning, I don't know what to do.  Maybe install an adult-size tent for them to go into when the realities of the world overwhelm them...", "NTA - thank you for being such a caring foster parent and giving emily a safe space. it\u2019s not your fault that your parents and siblings don\u2019t understand. it\u2019s her space, not anyone else\u2019s, and i\u2019m glad you held your ground for her until the end", "NTA you Saint.", "NTA. Maybe teach your family what her conditiona are exactly and how they affect her, but I fear it is better to just protect her and just keep the inconsiderate family members far away.", "NTA, this is really lovely.", "NTA. Unless these kids were all under 3 years old, they can understand that different people have different needs and that Emily needs the tent of toys that others don\u2019t touch. I\u2019m a teacher in an inclusion classroom, and I have found that kids are actually really good at understanding this kind of thing if explained to them. Plus, it sounds like the grownups were the ones throwing tantrums.", "NTA. You gave a neurodivergent child a place to feel safe. You stood your ground. Your siblings and parents may be upset, but Emily will remember this for a long time. She will remember that someone stood up for her and cares about her in a world that constantly tells her she's not cared about.", "How self absorbed are these people who feel so entitled to other people's belongings like that? I don't mean to speak ill of your family but how do they not understand they don't have a right to anything or toy she owns.\n\nNta", "NTA. When you take your kids to someone else\u2019s house the kids should be expected to abide by the rules of that house. It\u2019s a simple concept. Your family unfortunately are being TA\u2019s and are teaching their kids bad habits. Kudos to you for standing up for your foster child!", "NTA. Emily's NEEDS outweigh the WANTS of the other kids and their parents.  \n\nMaybe if the other parents used the word \"no\" occasionally, their kids would understand its meaning.", "NTA.", "NTA, I teach my kids to respect others\u2019 space and belongings. My 3 yr old understands this, even if he wouldn\u2019t have been happy about it. This situation is no different than not just walking into someone else\u2019s room and going through their things. If your siblings aren\u2019t teaching their children that they\u2019re not entitled to everything they see or want (especially if it belongs to someone else), then that\u2019s not your fault. Also, that little girl needs someone who is willing to advocate for her and her needs, so it\u2019s sounds like that\u2019s exactly what you were doing.", "NTA and I'm glad you stuck to your guns. The other parents need to be versed on how it can be for kids with special needs. This is a them problem and their kids need to learn to respect people's private spaces.", "NTA. The only critique I might have is that you could have given your sibs a heads up about the tent so they could take some time to talk about medical equipment and how we don't get to ride in someone's wheelchair or go in Emily's tent.", "NTA but everyone trying to ruin a child with special needs safe space are 100% AHs.  Especially when it was explained why and without it is causes a dangers situation.  I bet they just leave their homes door wide open for strangers to come in a use all their belongings right?  That is what this is equivalent to in the eyes for that little girl.  They can get over themselves and their spoiled children who apparently cannot be told no or to respect boundaries.  For the future it is probably best that they not come to your home to begin with as they feel entitled to just take over and cause potential psychological harm to a person who is extra delicate in that regard.", "So, if your nieces and nephews are out and about, and they see a kid in a wheelchair, and they think that looks cool, do they tell their parents, I want that wheelchair, and your siblings then tell the kid to give up his or her wheelchair because it\u2019s just not fair that their little darlings can\u2019t play with it? Or a kid with crutches???\n\nWhy am I thinking of Willy Wonka right now? Oh, yeah \u2014 that movie was about a bunch of enabled selfish little children who were, ultimately, taught some uncomfortable lessons. \n\nKids need boundaries. Being guided about what to do and what NOT to do in this world is Parenting 101 because it allows the species to survive AND because it shows children that we love and care about them. We not only want them to thrive, we want them to be properly socialized, which also helps their chances of survival. Failing to do this results in selfish twits that no one wants to be around. (I bet if you talked to those kids\u2019 teachers, you\u2019d learn that their parents are total pains.)\n\nNTA, x 1 billion. And kudos to you for not only fostering but for stepping up and being and providing Emily\u2019s safe space. You are making an enormous positive impact on her life.", "NTA.\n\nGood job looking out for the children in your care, and for fostering a special needs child. \n\nYour siblings could look at this as an opportunity to teach their children about respecting people's boundaries, especially as a guest in someone's home, and about respecting children with special needs. The fact that they are whining about the situation instead is why this answer isn't a NAH.", "NTA. This is no different than if you visit someone's house who has Lego sets on display or a collection of dolls/figures and kids who visit are told they aren't for them, don't touch. I raised 3 boys and wouldn't have had a problem with your setup. Kids need to learn no at an early age, if they are, situations like this aren't an issue. Your nieces/nephews sound spoiled.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA because as the foster parent, I think you have to put Emily and her safety first. Not sure if you really should have been hosting a bunch of people when you have Emily, who is easily overwhelmed and easily scared, living there but I\u2019m not voting on that point", "NTA. Your siblings should be teaching their children about special needs and having compassion instead of complaining to you because their kids whined about not getting to play in the tent. Your sins and parents are assholes and determined to pass that on to the newest generation.", "NTA. What a missed opportunity for your extended family to show some compassion (at Christmas, of all times) and for your siblings to talk with their kids about how sometimes different needs have to be respected. You sound like an amazing foster family to Emily.", "NTA.\n\nYou made accomodations for a special needs child. Private spaces should be respected. Was it annoying for everyone else, definitely. Kids will be kids and they will want what they can't have. I'm sure your siblings were just annoyed at having to deal with their kids whining. I have 2 kids and I would also be annoyed but I would also understand the situation. It's not my house, so it's not my rules. If I don't like it I can just leave. Your family's attitude sucks especially after you explained the situation. The only thing I can think of that you should have done was tell your siblings about the tent BEFORE they arrived so they could have prepared their kids.", "NTA", "Why are ppl rasing entitled kids that cannot be told no ? Why is it rude ? You are doing the right thing , she's so lucky to have you .", "Why can\u2019t we ride in Emily\u2019s wheelchair\u2026..\n\nGood life lesson for those other kids\u2026.", "NTA \n\nYou made a smart move, your family is being ridiculous.", "What ever happened to guests honoring the boundaries set by hosts and being a good guest?\n\nNTA!!\n\nWhy should the parents feel that their children are entitled to touch, use or play with anything and everything in your home? Tempting or not?  \n\nYou explained what the tent was for - it wasn't a toy or to be used as one, it is a therapy & safety device for Emily.  You were not \"taunting\" them with it.  It is pretty sad that the parents (yours and the other children's) could NOT understand that.  I suppose you could have moved it from the area where it wouldn't have been as noticeable during the event, but that would have been defeating the purpose of it for Emily and she is the priority here - not some kids disappointed they couldn't play with ONE THING. \n\nThe parents issue is that their precious angle was told \"NO\" and they had to 'deal' with the fallout of their kids wanting to play with something that was off limits to them.  It's a lot harder to tell a kid NO and actually PARENT a child and deal with the consequences than it is to just let the little one do whatever they want. \n\nYeah, sorry but your family kinda sucks and if it was one of their kids that needed a 'safe area' to decompress you better believe that they would be telling people not to touch it. \n\nIf they don't want you hosting anymore I would be careful of how they treat Emily when you go to their homes, I am betting they will tell their little angels not to let Emily play with this or that while there.   Good luck.", "NTA. \n\nNo means no. Their kids are not hurting by hearing it.", "NTA. The only thing I can think of is that it would probably have been helpful if everyone knew about Emily\u2019s needs and boundaries before the event so they could have prepared their kids. On the other hand, if they\u2019re still feeling wounded by them after the fact, maybe they simply aren\u2019t willing to accept that Emily needs her tent more than they need to be free from having to tell their kids no at a party.", "NTA my son is autistic and when he was younger we had a tent in the corner of our living room that was a \u2018time out\u2019 space (just to clarify time out was never a punishment it was used when one of my children wanted to have alone time). The rule was if he went in the tent no one was allowed to disturb him. It was important for him to have a safe space where he could go to calm himself when he was getting overwhelmed. \n\nMy younger son had to learn to accept this as did my nieces and nephews when they visited. It was one of the rules of the house, like don\u2019t grab the dog or jump on the furniture. It is good for children to learn to respect other\u2019s boundaries and to recognise that what they want doesn\u2019t override what other\u2019s need.", "NTA. \n\nYour siblings are acting entitled because they didn\u2019t want to tell their kids no, or explain to them that Emily needs a safe space. I guarantee if it was one of their children they would insist on accommodations. \n\nThank heavens Emily has someone like you looking out for her!", "NTA\n\nI see the utility of the tent. I see the utility of the rules in place. I also see why it caused problems with other kids the in family that made the holiday not-so-enjoyable for their parents. Logical argument & explanations don't necessarily make a kid feel any different.\n\nThey're TA for berating you, but I do think the solution of other people hosting is a good one. This set up clearly didn't work well.", "NTA , a lottttt of parent need to start parenting their kids. They need to understand that they aren\u2019t always going to get what they want just because they want it", "NTA\n\nThe fact the adults are more than willing to disrespect a small child's boundaries and potentially but her in danger all so their kids don't feel disappointed is gross.", "NTA you didn't elaborate but seeing you're fostering Emily she likely has suffered some trauma and giving her the tent is giving her the space she needs. I think it's a great and fun idea for her personally.\n\nIt's really sad that your family doesn't understand that Emily has some special needs and needs some accommodations.  You did all the right things here. \n\nMaybe next time they come over (if you even allow them to- NTA if you don't invite them until Emily doesn't need the tent anymore etc) could you get another tent for the kids?

I used to nanny/babysit for a handful of families in one neighborhood who all had 4-5 yo kids. About once a week I\u2019d have all the kids at one house together so they could play and the parents could all have a few hours to do whatever and we\u2019d alternate which family\u2019s house hosted each week. Pretty early on I started implementing a rule similar to what you did with Emily. The kid whose house we\u2019d be at would gather up any toys they didn\u2019t want to share and they\u2019d be put away somewhere off limits. Anything left out was fair game. It helped minimizing fighting and gave the children a sense of independence and control over their belongings. All the parents were on board with this as well. \n\nAdditionally, we had a kid in the group who had autism. He only joined us when it was at his house or the neighbor directly across from him since those were the two places he was comfortable enough with, and at both houses he had a designated safe spot where he could go if he needed to. He also had a special firetruck that functioned as his security object and he always had it with him. All the other kids were made to understand that this one toy was not a sharing toy, that it was something he needed and was off limits even though it was \u201cout\u201d. They also learned that if he was in his special spot, he was to be left alone until he chose to rejoin them. I only had to correct one of the children once, because she didn\u2019t quite grasp that even if he put the firetruck down, it still wasn\u2019t to be touched. After that I never had a problem with the kids or parents. If a group of 4 and 5 year olds can understand the needs of one little boy outweighing their own desires, then your family has no excuse other than selfish ignorance.

Hear me out.\n\nI am 100% for Emily's tent. This was a brilliant idea. Seriously, mad props.

You should have explained to them *before* they arrived and requested that they speak with their own kids before the trip so that those kids were prepared beforehand as well. Hell, you could have venmoed everyone $2 and let them go to a dollar store with their kid to buy a pack of stickers or something to give to Emily for her tent... that way they would get to be a part of it while still respecting boundaries.\n\nThis isn't to protect the poor little babies from hearing the word \"no.\" It would have had many benefits. Primarily, it would reduce the risk of others having a meltdown (idk the age of the other kids, but if they're not old enough to rip off some duct tape, then they're likely at prime meltdown age). That reduction in meltdowns would make everyone's lives a little easier, AND potentially reduce how overwhelmed Emily felt (especially if she's dealing with sensory issues that may be aggravated by a toddler's meltdown). Additionally, it would have given the other kid's guardians a chance to teach their kids about how some people have different needs. The best time to do any sort of teaching is during a neutral moment, not while we're being denied access to a shiny new thing that's just out of reach. Third, it would have given all of the adults a chance to come up with an alternative activity to redirect the other kids so that you could have avoided duct taping Emily's tent. Maybe Uncle Jim likes to camp and is willing to bring his tent over for the back yard, or Aunt Suzy has a projector and a white sheet where a movie could be popped on while the kids pretended to be camping *near* Emily's tent. \n\n.\n\n\nI'm gonna reiterate that it is a really soft ESH. It sounds like you've made some amazing progress with a little girl who needs your love.

There were kids 5 and under and kids 6/7 and older according to OP; not sure about the breakdown in how many of each age.

Plus when you put it in writing people can\u2019t argue with you while you\u2019re talking. They have to focus on what\u2019s written and the explanation. I actually commented nearly the same as Kuchi_kopi49 did above did and thought that if you gave them a heads up prior they would have plenty of time to prepare their children for the situation. And if they thought their kid would have a hard time then they could bring something else for the kids to focus on. Yes kids should learn the word No. But dropping them into a surprise situation like that if they\u2019re not good about accepting the word No is not the time to train them either. Not everyone is going to teach their kids the same and what *should* be a standard when raising kids isn\u2019t always reality unfortunately. So all you can do is prepare them the best you can for the situation and those that have to leave can leave. But at least they\u2019re going into a situation with a heads up and be prepared to be firm with their No when their kids ask. This can be turned into a valuable teaching situation with the right set up as well and teaching them that there are exceptions for kids not sharing and that they need to have empathy for others. They can say - Remember we talked about this? That\u2019s Emily\u2019s tent and she needs that to feel safe. \n\nYears ago I dated a guy with two children. His youngest at the time was a 5 yr old girl. She had a little trouble with the word No and I knew this. We were heading over to a friend of mine\u2019s house who lived in a historical home in a town nearby. They had lots of antique things that would be enticing for children, little miniature Mickey Mouse and Alice in wonderland figurines and stuff like that. A lot of breakable things. I had a talk with his daughter the day before going explaining to her that she could not touch things without asking. I knew it would be really enticing and that if she asked my friend, she might be able to touch a few of the things if she asked nicely. I primed her for the situation and again reminded her in the car on the way over, and I was really really impressed how well she handled it when we were there. She was very good about not touching things. And my friend was impressed too!", "That is perfect.", "I agree. If ducktape over the zipper stopped them.

Parents need to lead by example. A firm explanation to their children about Emily\u2019s needs should be all it takes for them to drop it. They won\u2019t die if they can\u2019t go on the tent.       \n\nThe only thing that may have helped this situation is if maybe you had taken a picture of the tent prior and sent e-mails out explaining the situation so the parents could talk to their children prior and prepare them and answer any questions they had on more detail. It would give everyone more time to process the situation. Also depending on where you live, if it\u2019s nice out then maybe putting a regular tent up in the backyard for the kids to play in. Obviously that would only work in warmer areas of the country this time of year. I get why they are attractive. It\u2019s like a little fort and I remember being fascinated and liking tents when I was a kid. But I definitely understood no also. Having another tent available would have taken the pressure off of Emily to share and might have encouraged Emily to invite them into her tent.

I hope there is a way to both help your siblings understand the need and to find ways to ensure that the cousins who come over have plenty to entertain them without feeling like they NEED to get into the tent.

People will judge behavior based on normative social structures and Emily's needs break the very tenets they are imparting on their own children. That of sharing their toys and social activities amoung their peer group. Of course they are going to be upset that you undermined those lessons by giving perceived special attention to Emily. The Adults are developed enough to understand that Emily's rules are different because she will take longer to reach the same level of cognitive development stage as their own children, those children will not understand and will resent the special rules and alienate Emily from their playgroup unless their own parents enforce the rule and can explain it to them in a way they can understand.

You probably shouldn\u2019t host again under these circumstances so that everyone can enjoy their Christmas.", "NTA\nIt's your house your rules. \n\nBut honestly as a parent navigating the holidays with small children, this would have made for a miserable time for us, too. It's already exhausting af. Idk if I would have gone home... but we wouldn't be making plans to come back another year. You can tell a small child \"no\" all day long but ultimately, when we want to relax and enjoy ourselves we make sure the environment is safe for ALL of the children present so it's not a nonstop game of guarding the no-go zones or chasing a toddler. This is probably much easier to do under normal routine circumstances but the holidays? The kids are BUZZED between visits and seeing their cousins all together. \n\nI think knowing how kids get excitable, I would have opted to move the tent into the bedroom and assigned an adult family member to shadow my own child for the night instead of putting the onus on all of our guests. If that's not an option... then hosting probably isn't a great idea.  I think you were well meaning but short sighted on this one. This would be akin to putting out a fragile glass nativity in the middle of the family room and expecting guests with small children to still enjoy themselves. It's a predictable mess.", "Not enough info for judgement.\n\nThe big thing here is that you didn't include the ages of the other children (nieces and nephews) that were visiting in the original post.\n\nIt is understandable that Emily should be entitled to her own space and items. You are in no way the AH for that.\n\nThe issue here is that if the visiting children are young - like 4 and under. It's a big ask to keep redirecting toddlers from an attractive nuisance. We can all sit here and say \"well the parents should tell their kids no.\" Well, even if you tell them no, it's going to be a constant battle over the duration of the stay.\n\nYes, things like empathy and self-control are necessary and must be taught, but restraint and self regulation are difficult for young children. An older child should have a better understanding, younger children (or neurodivergent children) do not.\n\n\nThis whole situation could have been avoided if you were more specific about the tent when communicating with adult family members. If mentioning the tent to them was so important that you remembered to do it, then you should have been specific about it's location in the house: giving your relatives a chance to prepare their children for that. \n\nIn comments, you said that you told them about the tent but didn't inform them of its location. You should have been clear that it was in a communal living space, where these guests would be situated for the duration of their visit.\n\nYou definitely are not the AH with regards to providing for your foster daughter, nor for setting boundaries. But the thing is, neither are the relatives that left early and removed their children from the environment. I think anybody with a young, impulsive child that needed constant redirection from a item usually seen as a form of play or entertainment that wasn't meant for them would opt to remove themselves given the circumstances.", "ESH - it\u2019s a good options for Emily.  But I can see why it\u2019d be annoying for the kids to have something they want to play with AND would typically be a kid play thing, exist within reach all night. It\u2019s asking for trouble and for kids to bother the adults all night. It would make sense to go elsewhere for everyone else in the family so you\u2019re going to need to navigate that.\n\nEdited: from N T A to E S H.  based on OP  not telling adults beforehand that there\u2019s be a tent full of books and toys in the mai. Living space that they\u2019d need to keep their kids away from all night long. I can think of worse tortures but not much. With a 16 month old, I would have just declined to make it better for everyone. Sure I can explain and wrangle and explain and wrangle - but I don\u2019t want to do it all night. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason people make \u2018untouchable\u2019 things inaccessible to small children.", "There are way too many people who don\u2019t realize or care how difficult it can be to constantly have to redirect a child\u2019s attention and be a broken record of \u201cNo\u201d for hours on end.  OP could relax knowing Emily was fine and accommodated for, but in return, the other parents most likely couldn\u2019t enjoy the party (ie. talking with other adults) because they were too busy being the broken records.  Even the most well behaved child would be frustrated that he or she couldn\u2019t play with a tent and toys right in front of them even if there were other things to do.", "It's unreasonable to expect a 3 year old to understand they can't play in that tent. The older kids, obviously, could comprehend special needs. It may make me an AH too, but I wouldn't want to spend my holiday constantly redirecting a toddler. I would skip holidays at op's home until my child was older. I don't think it makes op an AH, but her house is not a good fit for parents with toddlers.", "Do the cats let you pet them? Or only come around when there\u2019s food", "Oh yes, they love pets! I got them when they were about two months old, so I've trained/loved/snuggled a lot of the feral out of them, but some feral bits remain, ie: food stealing. One of them will fish nacho cheese containers out of the trash and lick them clean.\n\nBut I wouldn't change them for the world. My feral babies \ud83d\udc96", "WHAT?! My 2 cats and a dog literally run off the tile and laminate and find carpet when they have to puke, sometimes leaving a trail. It\u2019s maddening.", "In that case I\u2019d say they are feral no more! Semi ferals will allow humans in their presence but generally won\u2019t willingly be touched", "Oh, so a cop then?", "Not probably, that's 100% for sure what they're thinking.  They slow down to actually give you a chance to do something about it, which of course, you won't. They want you to think about your actions and see the error of your ways.", "no but the insane thing is the KIDS sounded like they fully understood 'hey that's actually her special safe place and you're welcome to enjoy everything outside it but please respect that' and only had to be corrected that that rule also applies to when she's not in the tent. This is all the fuckhead parents mad they have to slightly parent their kids.", "The delicate nature of the tent behaving as a solitary sanctuary and being a very important accommodation is what I did not think people would understand. I commented when this post was minutes old, and I'm glad to see social awareness has come a long way compared to social attitudes of the very recent past.", "I have no idea. Must be the same thing as the ones that reply they don't want to use Christmas as a teaching moment. Because parenting is only needed on non holiday days.", "I was assuming it was because the siblings don't understand what autistic means. But, this could be part of it, too.", "The parents can take their children into another room to explain it.\n\nMy kids hate being explained to/told off in front of other people anyway. So taking them somewhere quiet is a good option either way. Then they can ask questions etc.", "Y'all, my animals mind quicker than my family do!!  I whisper to the cats \"*get off the table.\"*  Boom. Down and away.", "I'm in love with your cat!!! Cat tax?", "My cat is soooooo naughty and my husband keeps telling me to spank her.  Seriously?  That's gonna cause me waaaaaay more harm than her \ud83d\ude44  You can't spank a cat, at least not this one \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She\u2019s hard to take a picture of, as she\u2019s seldom still.  I just tried, and after teasing me with cute poses, she launched herself at the screen barrier so she could kill my littlest kitty.  I tell people she\u2019s a sweet southern lady with the heart of a serial killer, lol.\n\nI put a picture of her as my profile pic - it\u2019s when she was spade and I couldn\u2019t keep the gray inflatable collar on her.  She got swallowed by the \u2018rag monster\u2019 - a homemade surgical \u2018onesie\u2019.", "We rotate the boxes out, she gets bored with them.  When she steals a new one, the old one goes in the recycle.  She was OBSESSED with an empty Golden Grahams box and an empty box from a variety pack of chips.  She thinks she has SO many toys, I think theres trash all over my floor.", "That is honestly adorable! I will say our cat doesn't care to be picked up and held while we are walking around. She doesn't like it at all. I think it is the lack of control though. She will come to you for pets or snuggles and sleep on our bed (typically in my hair) or on our laps. Just don't pick her up \ud83e\udd23"]}
