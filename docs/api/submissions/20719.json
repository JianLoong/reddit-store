I did marine biology as an undergrad and got into med school with my degree. I backed out after I couldn't put together enough loans to pay for it, and instead did a PhD in marine biology (in health-relevant research).

You cannot keep him isolated from any media that might allow him to stay from your dreams. That is how you give your children lifelong mental issues and depression.

Grown adults change careers all the time. Adults that are so fixated on their kid fitting into a certain mold and expect them to stay in the career path they envision are doing them a disservice.
