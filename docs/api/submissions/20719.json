I did marine biology as an undergrad and got into med school with my degree. I backed out after I couldn't put together enough loans to pay for it, and instead did a PhD in marine biology (in health-relevant research). Eventually I got tired of the epic grind of constantly seeking funding while watching mass ecological decline, and I transferred my skills to work in medical comms with perfectly fine pay, meaningful impact, and an enjoyable workplace.

When i asked him, where he will take the time for that he answered: \"You and dad can watch the kids.\"", "Mummy would be a great job!  Housing is included and you just lay real still.  Score.  My child wanted to be an elf around that age.  What a stupid thing to argue about.", "When my son was very little, he told us when he grew up he was going to be a giant robot.\nMy husband was silent for about ten seconds, and then just quietly said \"Why didn't I think of that?\"\n\nMy son is 13 now, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't still plan to be a giant robot.\nMy 11 year old still plans to be a cat, and I think my youngest is lining up a career as either a supervillain, or an extreme window washer.\n\nLittle kids change their future plans all the time. They don't even know what jobs are out there yet.\nWhatever they do, it should be something they're interested in, and something the enjoy, not something someone has decided they should do. NTA.", "Aaahhh.... Inferno and Ratchet. Good choice.", "My brother wanted to be a fighter pilot when he was 9. If that didn't work out, his backup plan was to be an ice cream truck driver.", "\"I had this friend once, he took some acid\n\nnow he thinks he's a fire engine.\n\nIt's ok, until he pisses on your lighter\"", "And why the heck not! Good luck to the kid :-).", "Ouch. I think there are some big problems in this marriage that need to be addressed. No reasonable person expects a 9 year old to commit to a career path, and a man who values his marriage does not go running to his bigoted mother after picking a fight with his wife over a nature documentary.", "I always loved hearing what they wanted to be and how they were going to fit it all in", "I'm actually gutted, they all sound like really good career prospects. \n\nI can imagine starting as a small robot and transferring my conscience into something like Liberty Prime from fallout once I complete my KPIs", "My four year old wants to be a farmer that farms digitally so he can grow veggies and play video games \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m good with this one \ud83d\ude02", "I totally wanted to be Optimus Prime at one point.", "I feel like you need to expand on the extreme window washing. Is that the abseiling down skyscraper extreme, or running up ladders and washing windows as quickly as possible extreme? Picturing the last one like the extreme fireman race competitions that they have, only with a squeegee and cloth", "So, professional Farmville player?", "I *still* want to be Optimus Prime", "Well see\u2026 we\u2019re also vegetarians so I think he wants some actual produce produced \ud83d\ude02"]}
