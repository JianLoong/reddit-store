I did marine biology as an undergrad and got into med school with my degree. I backed out after I couldn't put together enough loans to pay for it, and instead did a PhD in marine biology (in health-relevant research). Eventually I got tired of the epic grind of constantly seeking funding while watching mass ecological decline, and I transferred my skills to work in medical comms with perfectly fine pay, meaningful impact, and an enjoyable workplace.

And even private schools and highschools are not going to care if he drops from 1st to 5th or 10th.  \n\nAs long as he stays in his routine, and continues the same studying and testing habits. He will be fine. You don't want the kid to burn out by 14byears old. \n\nAnd as for his career dreams. He will change another dozen times before he even gets to high school.  You cannot keep him isolated from any media that might allow him to stay from your dreams. That is how you give your children lifelong mental issues and depression.

As a parent you should encourage your child to learn about new things and encourage them to chase their dreams. \n\nYour son will probably change his mind 10 or 20 times as he grows up about what he wants to be. Grown adults change careers all the time. Adults that are so fixated on their kid fitting into a certain mold and expect them to stay in the career path they envision are doing them a disservice. Kids are individuals with their own likes, dislikes, and dreams that may be different than their parents. That is perfectly OK!\n\nYour husband starting an argument about this and saying he won't pay his tuition if that's what he chooses is awful.

He still thought she was on track for med school, and justified his reasoning by saying that if she went to the (posh, private) school he taught at, her grades would be A+s by the time she sat her exams.
