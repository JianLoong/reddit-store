Depending where you live, that might be illegal. It sounds like fraud. I\u2019d question if you even won genuinely, or if you won on the assumption you would give the winnings back to him.

He's trying to take advantage of your friendship.", "NTA. Be careful. His behavior sounds unethical and fraudulent and he wants you to get involved. How would the other people who bought raffle tickets feel knowing that there weren\u2019t actually prizes? They probably wouldn\u2019t have bought tickets. They\u2019re potentially being defrauded too. This has class action lawsuit written all over it.

I dunno I really couldn\u2019t imagine this being a serious dilemma, especially if he is a good friend as you put it. Dear god is that what people consider a good friend these days?

I\u2019ve lost sleep from thinking about what to do. He is a good friend and I know this would almost certainly ruin our friendship. But you are right, he would not have this choice if a random person won and is definitely taking advantage of our friendship. It seems like it\u2019s going to be a lose lose situation for me.", "Even if it was free, thr friend is not entitled to it. Someone once gave me a raffle ticket because they said they wouldn't win anything. Less that 5 minutes later, that ticket was called, and I still have that jacket.

All I know is that he was initially excited about it because he was expecting to make a huge profit from the amount of people who would enter the raffle. It obviously did not go as planned for him.", "This is not possible. He went through a raffle manager to legalize the raffle.", "That was my thought as well. The raffle went on for way to long bc the friend couldn\u2019t afford the payout, and he was hoping to keep dragging it out. I am sure someone who purchased a ticket lodged a complaint and this \u201cthird party\u201d got some sort of kickback to pick a certain winner.\n\nUsually in raffles with prizes this large the state would require rules against friends and family entering for this reason.", "You are also not considering it isnt just giving back the car. On large raffles like that there are usually tax implications.", "Do you know if this was in fact random? Or did he rig it so he could pick you over other participants? I would give him the choice to refund everyone for all of the ticket sales or deliver the advertised prize.", "Correction: he's been a good friend to this point. A good friend wouldn't ask you to do this. Fuck that", "I\u2019d be careful with that, the car and money prize are generally considered income which is taxable and if there is a third party handling it they will likely report it as 1099 (non-employee compensation) income, which must be cleaned on a tax return, if it\u2019s transferred back it would likely be considered a gift which means OP would have the tax burden but no award to benefit from.  OP\u2019s friend sounds like a greedy AH", "Has he proven to you that the raffle didn't make much money?", "Right. I was just emphasizing that Op got no special deal on the ticket just because they're friends. Why would friend expect a special deal from Op's winnings?", "This is what i am wondering. Are we sure the whole raffle wasn\u2019t just rigged?", "This comment needs to be the top comment.", "NTA\n\nBy law, he has to award the prize.  And you will have to pay taxes on the full value of the award.  If you accept the prize and sign it over to him, you would lose thousands of dollars.", "NTA, do not give him back the car.  Depending on where you are you may have a tax liability related to the car so you'd end up paying taxes on a car you didn't get to keep.  You also presumably paid for the raffle tickets which would be wasted if you don't get to keep the prize.  Not only is it an enormous dick move to ask for the prize back it's incredibly suspect.  At best your 'friend' (because a real friend would never ask this) is an idiot, this raffle would never have directly made money.  It's not about making money, it's about marketing, the same as any other giveaway or prize draw.  At worst, he rigged the game so you'd win, thinking he could take advantage of your friendship to cover the costs of his business mistake.\n\nYou have a new car, congratulations.  An asshole identified himself and is helping you cut off your friendship on terms that are extremely favorable to you, congratulations again, you won twice!", "Often times these raffles have 3rd party insurance. So the company isn\u2019t really out the car but the insurance they paid. Sounds even more sketchy.", "This type of raffle is normally insured just in case something like this happens, tell them it's not your fault he didn't cover himself.\n\n\nDefinitely NTA op", "NTA\n\nYou won. He should have put in a condition that the raffle would make x amount.\n\nWould he have given you more if the raffle made millions? I don't think so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to say - how come you found out off a third party and not him? Was he not going to tell you?", "FYI, You will have to pay taxes on the prize.", "NTA, don\u2019t give it back. \nBut\u2026be careful. A similar thing happened here in Australia a year or so ago where the company running the raffle hadn\u2019t been making enough income, gave the car to the prize winner but the car was still under finance because of the company\u2019s lack of money and the car got repossessed. \nThe winner had spent $$ paying on road costs and transporting it to her state too. \nYour friend might be in a similar situation, can you run a check on the car ownership?", "NTA \n\nbut really this comes down to how much you care for this friend.. yes it\u2019s unfair of him to ask but if you don\u2019t  need the car and it will save him from a big loss maybe give him the car? i mean is it worth losing a good friend over this?   \nMaybe have a proper convo with him and sell it to him cheap if you must get something out of this \n\nI know that it sound like he\u2019s being a prick but he might actually be in a terrible situation", "ESH - Is the business struggling?", "NTA. he cant calculate risks. thats not your problem. and he isnt a good friend if he demands that... ir does he just wants this specific car to show off...?\ud83e\udd14", "NTA", "Nta", "I\u2019d be curious what the fine print is on this raffle. Or I guess state law? I work in design for food companies and they often do giveaways or sweepstakes and I, myself and my family are not permitted to win. Not sure if that\u2019s just a fairness rule or if it\u2019s fomenting dictated by the state laws?", "He might lose thousands, but if you give up the car you\u2019ll lose tens of thousands. He made the mistakes, not you.  Why does he deserve the money more than you?  How is this different from him just asking you to give you that much cash because HE made bad business choices?\n\nNTA.  Keep the car.", "Nta", "Would they have asked that of a prize winner that was not their friend? NTA you are owed a prize. That's why raffling off something like a car is a bad idea.", "NTA you won it fair and square.\n\nKeep the car.", "NTA.  He should have taken that into account. And it's rather underhanded to get the top prize awarded back to him.", "NTA. Friend should have had a threshold before the raffle was taken  or cancelled (there are some online companies that do this) or had insurance against it. \n\nTo me, even as someone lacking in the friend department, the friendship would be dead at this point. Either I'd be disappointed in the friend who took a prize away or their mad because I wouldn't give it back. Might as well take the car tbh.", "NTA - and if he doesn't award the prize, it is likely illegal as well.", "NTA & that\u2019s technically fraud.", "Enjoy the car. This is beyond belief. Your friend got an extremely valuable lesson from this. He should thank you. NTA.", "NTA but if he is a good friend I would not accept the car unless you are in absolute need for it.  It\u2019s going to ruin your friendship and your taxes are going to F you.  Think about the taxes man.  I would say to friend take me out to dinner and drinks for one night and give him the car.  It\u2019s not worth it because of the taxes alone especially if you can\u2019t afford it.", "Nta - you won and he isn\u2019t being fair.", "Do you think he would be refunding the raffle tickets if it was too profitable?", "NTA. Don\u2019t let friendships and business mix. He\u2019s taking advantage of his friendship. He wouldn\u2019t say that to you unless he knew you. He knew the consequences.", "Whether he knows the winner or not, it is fraud.", "Lesson to friend: if you want to rig your raffle, you have to get your plant in on it first!", "This should be top comment.", "There\u2019s probably more than 25% of the car\u2019s value in tax liability", "Other than the tax implications. It\u2019s not quite that easy unfortunately.", "That sounds like fraud.", "If it were ever found out it would constitute fraud. Not only did a friend \"win\" the raffle but they gave back some of the money to the person running the raffle. The only thing to do to avoid any legal trouble is to keep the prize and never send the friend a dime.", "If you have to screw yourself to 'save a friendship,' the friendship isn't worth saving.", "Shouldn\u2019t have done the raffle if their wasn\u2019t a big want for one. He gambled, he lost.", "I agree, why would the friend want to fuck OP over like that?", "If the friend couldn\u2019t afford to lose out on the raffle, shouldn\u2019t have had one.", "Geez---my idea has been judged as  a no", "Did you actually win or did your friend deliberately pull your name from the raffle?\n\nWhen such raffles are run here there's a stipulation that the closing date can be extended if the ticket sales doesn't cover costs so that something like this doesn't happen.\n\nI'd be very wary that this whole thing isn't outright fraud from the beginning.", "If you don\u2019t take the car, your friend stands to make likely tens of thousands in profit from this raffle. Why should they get a huge windfall from something that was ultimately a huge failure for them, all at your expense. You did the right thing, you helped out a friend doing a raffle, you probably wouldn\u2019t have bought this raffle ticket if it wasn\u2019t a friend selling it. You\u2019ve already done good by your friend and now they\u2019re trying to take advantage of you. Collect your winnings and accept that you\u2019ll probably lose a friend, if you don\u2019t collect your gonna resent you friend, either way this friendship is over. Don\u2019t worry tho, people make new friends all the time, friends are temporary, only circumstances hold you together, when circumstances push you apart you\u2019ll lose contact either way.", "It\u2019s over.

I think that was a story here recently", "NTA. Screw that. Maybe he should take responsibility for sucking at marketing the raffle instead of pawning the result of it off on you. Sounds like the raffle was supposed to be a way to make money for a business that is suffering from crappy marketing. Let\u2019s save a business suffering from poor marketing with a marketing ploy that was done poorly. Sounds like your friend needs to go get a job working for someone else.", "Sure but what does that mean? Did he still make a profit and it's not enough profit? Is he straight up lying to you because he thinks he can walk away with both ticket sales and the car? Dude is sketchy as heck asking for you to gift him a car, much less with so little info. Plus doing that is going to have you still paying taxes on the car.", "If that\u2019s the case, the manager is a professional and there were likely Ts&Cs that said a min number of tickets had to be sold, the raffle holder could cancel and refund everyone, etc. sounds like your friend may be scamming you.", "Then given that you're dealing with the raffle manager to keep things legal and arms length, no.\n\nBesides, you can't just 'sign over' a car.  There's tax implications, amoung other things.\n\nShit, I'd almost suggest mentioning this to said raffle manager.", "Right but real friends would work that out (cover taxes with raffle earnings, whatever). I can't imagine tossing out a valued friendship over something material and ultimately meaningless that I didn't expect to win in the first place. \n\nSeems a lot of people on here don't really understand true friendship. It's having each other's back, \"Ride or die\" for life", "I would never screw my friend over like that.  To each their own.", "u/bapaheelwani", "Lets play the reverse uno card.

In much of the world prize winnings aren't taxed", "Nothing in OP's post implies that the friend expected anything. It simply states that he asked. There's a fair possibility that it wasn't an easy ask and that he felt like shit having to ask.\n\nYes, he made a bad business decision and that's on him   but he merely asked a friend for help. While he may not be a solid businessman, I don't think that makes him an asshole.", "They referred to the value in dollars, being in the US seems likely.", "I mean Canada exists but OP is definitely in the US based on post history.", "And Australia and New Zealand...", "Doesn't Canada tax winnings as well?", "Yes it\u2019s possible they are in Canada but as you say they seem to be in the US based on post history.", "No."]}
