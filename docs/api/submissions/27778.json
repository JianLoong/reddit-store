He's taking advantage of your friendship. If a stranger won the prize, would he be asking for it back? That would be fraud. Depending on how good a friend he is, the best I would do is sell the car and share the cash.", "Did your friend give you the raffle ticket for free? If not, why would you give him a car for free? You won it fair and square. It's yours.\n\nLet's look at the even split option. If the car is worth 10K, then if some stranger won, would you give your friend 5K out of your pocket just to help your friend?\n\nNTA for not effectively letting your friend reach into your pocket and pull out lots of cash.", "NTA. The fact that the raffle list money is his problem not yours. If he refuses the award the prize notify the third party provider and whoever else would deal with a fraud claim in your area.", "NTA. Depending where you live, that might be illegal. It sounds like fraud. I\u2019d question if you even won genuinely, or if you won on the assumption you would give the winnings back to him. Your friend shouldn\u2019t offer such valuable prizes if he can\u2019t be certain he can recoup the value via ticket sales.", "NTA. You won the prize legimately and he's taking advantage of your friendship with him to recoup/ make even more money (since he could be lying about not makinf money from the raffle).", "NTA. As a compromise you could just ask for all the money the raffle made so you can have money and he can still have the vehicle", "INFO:  how does a raffle last for a year?  Is that so they get tons of entries?  But someone is still going to win, correct?\n\nI'm leaning n  t. a but would like to hear more about the raffle", "NTA.  I assume you bought the winning ticket.  Your friend can't just decide because it is you that won that he can renege. What would he plan to do with all the money he has already collected?  This just doesn't smell right to me.", "Nta. What a dick.", "WTAF? No, he doesn't get it back. NTA", "If he made a killing and someone else won, would he refund your ticket?", "Nta that's why you either get donations as raffle prizes or only spend what you can afford to lose", "NTA - if anyone else had won the car and he asked for it back, he could be charged with fraud. He's trying to take advantage of your friendship.", "NTA. Be careful. His behavior sounds unethical and fraudulent and he wants you to get involved. How would the other people who bought raffle tickets feel knowing that there weren\u2019t actually prizes? They probably wouldn\u2019t have bought tickets. They\u2019re potentially being defrauded too. This has class action lawsuit written all over it. Accept your prize.", "If it were I, I would consider working a deal with him where you sell the car and split the money. It would possibly save a friendship and you still get money.", "Honestly it\u2019s a lose, lose.\n\nMy best thought would be let him keep the car but he gives you 100% of the raffle money. If he would be cool with that it would still kinda be a win win. If he\u2019s not cool with that, you got a greedy friend you probably don\u2019t need in your life.\n\nIf all else fails you won fair and square. And if I was another person who bought a raffle ticket and saw him with the car after the raffle I would feel scammed. Professional raffle company or not..", "find out what the car is worth then tell him you will give him the car for 75% of the value. if he refuses then it isnt about him losing money.  (change the percentage to what you are comfortable with. Making the offer at all will determine your friends intentions)", "\tNTA\nHave you considered that you may have \"won\" because you are friends?", "Man a lot of people on here have serious friendship issues. He\u2019s your friend, he made a mistake, you can either choose to force him to pay consequences for that mistake and burn the friendship so you can have some stuff. It\u2019s not even like you\u2019re losing anything in the end, hell it sounds like he\u2019s more than happy to let you keep the money portion of the winnings. I dunno I really couldn\u2019t imagine this being a serious dilemma, especially if he is a good friend as you put it. Dear god is that what people consider a good friend these days? Someone they would say \u2018F you\u2019 to because they made a mistake and were pleading with you not to run off with their shirt they gave away by mistake.\n\nSome seriously F\u2019d up extremely selfish people on here.", "Nta. You won. \n\nBut why would you want to fuck your friends over like that?", "Friendship vs prize fairly won.

Your friend is not a very good businessman.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHe took the risk, it doesn't matter who won.", "NTA", "This is what has been lingering in my mind since he asked. I\u2019ve lost sleep from thinking about what to do. He is a good friend and I know this would almost certainly ruin our friendship. But you are right, he would not have this choice if a random person won and is definitely taking advantage of our friendship. It seems like it\u2019s going to be a lose lose situation for me.", "Even if it was free, thr friend is not entitled to it. Someone once gave me a raffle ticket because they said they wouldn't win anything. Less that 5 minutes later, that ticket was called, and I still have that jacket. NtA", "I'm sure I heard of someone who got scammed winning a car in a raffle and then the car was repo'd because it was never actually paid off by the people running the raffle.", "I\u2019m not really sure why it lasted so long. All I know is that he was initially excited about it because he was expecting to make a huge profit from the amount of people who would enter the raffle. It obviously did not go as planned for him.", "This is not possible. He went through a raffle manager to legalize the raffle.", "That was my thought as well. The raffle went on for way to long bc the friend couldn\u2019t afford the payout, and he was hoping to keep dragging it out. I am sure someone who purchased a ticket lodged a complaint and this \u201cthird party\u201d got some sort of kickback to pick a certain winner.\n\nUsually in raffles with prizes this large the state would require rules against friends and family entering for this reason.", "You are also not considering it isnt just giving back the car. On large raffles like that there are usually tax implications.", "Do you know if this was in fact random? Or did he rig it so he could pick you over other participants? I would give him the choice to refund everyone for all of the ticket sales or deliver the advertised prize.", "Correction: he's been a good friend to this point. A good friend wouldn't ask you to do this. Fuck that", "I\u2019d be careful with that, the car and money prize are generally considered income which is taxable and if there is a third party handling it they will likely report it as 1099 (non-employee compensation) income, which must be cleaned on a tax return, if it\u2019s transferred back it would likely be considered a gift which means OP would have the tax burden but no award to benefit from.  OP\u2019s friend sounds like a greedy AH", "Has he proven to you that the raffle didn't make much money?", "Right. I was just emphasizing that Op got no special deal on the ticket just because they're friends. Why would friend expect a special deal from Op's winnings?", "This is what i am wondering. Are we sure the whole raffle wasn\u2019t just rigged?", "This comment needs to be the top comment."]}
