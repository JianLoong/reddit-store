Depending on where you are you may have a tax liability related to the car so you'd end up paying taxes on a car you didn't get to keep.  You also presumably paid for the raffle tickets which would be wasted if you don't get to keep the prize.  Not only is it an enormous dick move to ask for the prize back it's incredibly suspect.  At best your 'friend' (because a real friend would never ask this) is an idiot, this raffle would never have directly made money.

So if I went out and bought a $40,000 car I would pay $2400 in taxes plus registration, title licensing etc. Even though you won the car you have to pay that tax to claim the car. Then on top of that $40,000 is considered income so you probably have to pay income tax on it. \n\nWhich is why a lot of people on TV shows like The Price is Right, they take the cash because they would have to fork out their own cash to pay taxes on the things they won! I just don't see how it's possible for you to sign that car over to him without paying all those taxes anyway or at least getting audited for them.
