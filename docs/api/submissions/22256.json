She came to see our whole family at our grandma's house and was obvious for everyone that she had cosmetic surgeries. Not only does she look way younger, she also used to have a more round face and now the shape is totally different, she was always skinny and now she has curves, may have done something with her eyes and hairline too. She looks great (I even told her that) and the only reason our family knew she had work done was because we knew what she looked like before.\r  \n\r  \nShe tried to deny and told us it was all natural because new diet, exercise and her features changed as she grew older but it was all in vain, everyone could tell there was no way she didn't have any surgeries. Eventually she gave up and started talking about the surgeries and justify how some of the changes she made weren't achievable any other way so she \"had to do it\".\r  \n\r  \nOur family made fun of her (we tease each other all that the time, a cousin even joked about my addiction problem during a wedding toast) and pointing the reason why she was distant was because she was probably waiting for the surgeries to heal. I did tease her a bit, congratulated her for finally looking younger than me.\r  \n\r  \nShe snapped and said that because of me drug addiction I should look way older and that she always \"deserved\" to look better than me. I talked back and things snowballed into a fight where she kept pointing my short comings in life and how everything I have is unearned. I told her it's not my fault she thinks she's better than everyone and that she's not entitled to look a certain way just because she has money. We haven't talk since.\r  \n\r  \nTo my surprise, our family sided with her. They told me I knew how sensitive she was about her appearence and that she did work hard to get what she wanted.

You are only 2 years apart so their guess was most likely not due to looks.", "She took a low shot after you did. And FYI, the more you try to make yourself not sound jealous the more jealous you sound. Its obvious that it does bother you that she looks younger than you now. If it didn't then all of your comments wouldn't revolve around her looks!\n\nYTA!! Just accept it and shut up", "YTA\nAnd I get the impression you weren't being as civil as you're making out you were being.", "Info: what was your goal? \n\nRight now you seem spiteful. Why does it matter? Who cares? Is she safe? Is she healthy? Are you safe and healthy? What did you hope to accomplish?", "ESH You'll both said some pretty hard stuff being an overachiever has it's own trauma you'll both came up from the same household and have different trauma still trauma none less, but I will give a YTA she did work hard for her money it wasn't given to her", "Honestly ESH. \n\nSeems like both of you used things that you knew the other would be sensitive about, not cool.", "The first sign of YTA and jealousy is \u201cover achiever\u201d, second, criticism \u201cwithout a tone\u201d. Strangely had you just said \u201cwithout makeup\u201d it\u2019d be a different thing. Oh, and you also said \u201ceveryone knows she\u2019s insecure\u201d, you would only know this had you discussed your sister with \u201ceveryone\u201d.\n\nSounds like you\u2019re insecure about your looks and about your former addiction.\nTruth is, you didn\u2019t deserve to look younger than you did after your addiction.\n\nThere\u2019s tease where only one party is \u201csensitive\u201d i.e your cousins teasing, and then there\u2019s \u201cmany a true word said in jest\u201d or a version of it.\nYou saw an opportunity air a personal vendetta, twist the knife and you took it.\n\nYou\u2019re just as insecure about your looks as your sister is.\nAlso discussing your sister\u2019s insecurities with \u201ceveryone\u201d is pretty detestable.", "ESH the whole family is ridiculous.\nWhy do you compete with your own sister? Daddy issues, mommy issues? Golden child - scapegoat relation? Who do you need to prove yourself to?", "ESH, but double suckage points go to every single loser in your family who participates in the stigmatization of cosmetic surgery.", "ESH. You shouldn't have teased her, neither should the rest of the family. However she shouldn't have said what she did. You've done brilliantly to overcome an addiction, and no one deserves to look better than anyone else, beauty is luck of the draw.", "ESH", "Yeah, YTA. She is not only within her rights to do any aesthetic work she wants to, but the fact that she has been suffering for years is plain as day, even though your spin. The fact that everyone made fun of her (awful, horrible, i see why she never thinks she\u2019s good enough) doesn\u2019t give you a license to be horrible too.", "ESH wtf is this family dynamic \u2026", "YTA after seeing what the rest of what you said to her in the comments", "Hopefully, never again. What a nightmarish bunch of people.", "Did you see some of the comments OP posted about all of the things she said to her sister?", "Yikes if I was her I would move far away to", "Do you think it may be her first visit in four years because how your family and you behaves?", ">I can only assume\n\nThat\u2019s the problem - everything you have written is based on you assuming *so many things.*\n\n>I think she looks at her life and how I lived mine and thinks \u201cI deserve to be better looking than she does\u201d\n\nYou are assuming all of this.  Every bit.  You\u2019re assuming her whole thought process, and worse you\u2019re assuming it is all based around comparing her whole life to yours.\n\nEveryone is telling you that she worked hard to get what she wanted, and all you see is \u201cshe is an over-achiever, she feels entitled because she has money.\u201d  You need to seriously stop projecting, and leave your sister alone.", "You're the one who brought it up though?! You 'teased and congratulated her' whatever that's supposed to mean... By saying she 'finally looked younger than you'. \n\nGot to break it to you that's not congratulating someone that's called a backhanded compliment. It's a way to drag others down whilst trying to sound like you're saying something nice. It's cruel and transparent.\n\nYou started it, you and your family were bashing on your sister for something she's so insecure about she went and spent who knows how much on surgery to perfect it. And even that wasn't good enough. You all circled round her like vultures picking her apart until she snaps and then you get to bring out the righteous indignation because of what she said! It's a common bullying tactic and it won't wash OP.", "You are so toxic. Ugh. I'll congratulate on being sober if you can explain to be me why a sober person would pick up on toxic behaviors (that should have been readily addressed in your personal therapy as an addict) and choose to single out your half sister.\n\n You're still in active recovery. Every addict is. Knock it off. Stop normalizing any toxic behavior.", "Good lord why does everyone have to pander to this spoilt middle aged princess?! Grow up !!", "You teased her about something she didn't have a choice in, it's not like she was stunning and brave sized brought on by lifestyle choices, she was born weird looking. The addict thing is a  lifestyle choice. Your the A.  But it's pretty funny congratulating her on finally looking younger", "YTA. Look, you started it. You were all teasing her, she bit back. Some of your comments were flat out bitchy 'congratulated her for finally looking younger than me.' How nasty.\n\nYea, she was harsh, but I can't blame her.", "OK to begin with you said \u201cshe probably had these feelings buried inside for a long time. \u201cI\u2019m truly not understanding where The probably comes in at because this is information that you gave us at the very beginning of this post, I don\u2019t know if you being an addict has fried a couple brain cells, but I feel like any normal person would be able to put two and two together and read a room. Not even read a room. All you have to do is go back and read your post. I don\u2019t trust addicts on my best day even ex addicts because once an addict always an addict this is something I\u2019ve grew up with. I know this is something I have to get out of but I\u2019m still pretty mixed up with my family and addiction, you probably more than likely don\u2019t deserve to look like that and that sounds shitty but that\u2019s because there is probably so many things that you did during active addiction depending on how long you were addicted, I honestly don\u2019t know the timeline but if you were not an addict, you were probably not a morally upstanding person because this post just screeches that you are an un- empathetic person, but not only that you don\u2019t have enough common sense to see how really shitty and crazy it was to read this post", "And also to add to what I previously said, it\u2019s none of y\u2019all\u2019s fucking business what she got done y\u2019all couldn\u2019t of cared fuck all what she was doing and y\u2019all didn\u2019t put in any money.", "ESH massive red flags from your whole family no one is innocent here.", "I was already concluding YTA when you said she was an overachiever.  It sounds like you think you automatically lose whenever she wins.", "ESH. Your entire failure sounds toxic. She obviously got the surgeries because she was insecure about her looks, why couldn't you all just let her be??", "YTA. She deserves to be happy and it seems like she worked hard for it. You only mention two things about yourself; recovering drug addict and prettier than her. While i commend you on getting over the addition (seriously, that's amazing) if the only thing you ave going for you is your looks, you should rethink insulting people about improving their looks (even if other people wee also joking about it, which just mean they are AH's too).", "ESH. Everyone here is shallow and insecure.", "Not just the asshole, but also petty and jealous. Just sad", "YTA. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, sis! Instead of tearing each other down, let's lift each other up and rock our own unique styles. Slay queen!", "What a cow she sounds", "OP, you sound bitter and jealous. Your sister probably has her faults, but I understand why she doesn't visit you more often. There's teasing and there's being mean disguised as teasing. You seem insecure about her looking good. Seriously, how old are you ? It's never too late to make amends though, so I suggest you pick up your phone and have a heart to heart conversation with her. Be kind, OP. You're the big sister, so act like it. If you don't you'll come to regret it one day.", "Addiction runs on the family. Good for you for beating yours, but your sister seems to be still struggling with hers. She's addicted to her appearance and clearly dealing with mental health stuff. Anyone who gets cosmetic surgery is dealing with mental health stuff because it's not normal. But this is family and you should be able to have fun and rib each other a little bit. She seems like she was overly sensitive. NTA", "ESH. Really makes me appreciate my comparatively mild family. Going to have our annual reunion in two weeks and I am worry-free about drama. Worst I've got to worry about is the coin flip of whether one specific relative gets booked for drunk driving afterwards... again.", "Oh, so it is okay for her to slam you, but not for you to push back.   I get family was happy to see her, and probably afraid if she is pissed off that she might stay gone longer next time.  Still.   Actually, the fact that you got clean, stay clean and seem to have a good life is testament to how well adjusted you are.   Your sister is an insecure sniveling little girl who basically just stamped her foot.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t get to get mad at you just for existing.", "I'm glad I'm not the only one who picked up on that. This post was awful to read.", "You're right, we shouldn't have joked about that. It's just this sense of entitlement in her response that bothers me, that somehow she's deserving of a look she got through surgery and I'm not because of how I led my life.", ">and no one deserves to look better than anyone else, beauty is luck of the draw.\n\nWe really shouldn't have teased her and I came to regret that. But this last sentence is something I'm trying to point out that my sister couldn't accept and used it to lash out on me.", "She thinks she \"should\" and \"deserves\" to be more attractive, that the way she lived her life means she gets to be beautiful (unlike me, apparently, whose life proves I deserve to be ugly or whatever). She realized that even with everything she's done and she's still not that good looking and resorted to the surgery because it's not right that she's not as attractive as she thinks she's entitle to be.", "As I said to the other person.\n\nShe thinks she \"should\" and \"deserves\" to be more attractive, that the way she lived her life means she gets to be beautiful (unlike me, apparently, whose life proves I deserve to be ugly or whatever).
