She's an over achiever, top of her class, college scholarship and athlete. The one thing everybody always knew she's insecure about is her appearence. She's the kind of woman who refuses to leave home without a tone of make up and changes her hair once a week because she never thinks it looks good enough.\r  \n\r  \nWe look nothing alike (we have different dads) and since our late teens people assume I'm the younger sister. The fact I look younger particularly bothers her. I'm a recovered addict (been clean for 4 years) and considering my history I should probably look worse than I do.\r  \n\r  \nMy sister lives in Europe now and came home last month for the first time in 4 years. She came to see our whole family at our grandma's house and was obvious for everyone that she had cosmetic surgeries. Not only does she look way younger, she also used to have a more round face and now the shape is totally different, she was always skinny and now she has curves, may have done something with her eyes and hairline too. She looks great (I even told her that) and the only reason our family knew she had work done was because we knew what she looked like before.\r  \n\r  \nShe tried to deny and told us it was all natural because new diet, exercise and her features changed as she grew older but it was all in vain, everyone could tell there was no way she didn't have any surgeries. Eventually she gave up and started talking about the surgeries and justify how some of the changes she made weren't achievable any other way so she \"had to do it\".\r  \n\r  \nOur family made fun of her (we tease each other all that the time, a cousin even joked about my addiction problem during a wedding toast) and pointing the reason why she was distant was because she was probably waiting for the surgeries to heal. I did tease her a bit, congratulated her for finally looking younger than me.\r  \n\r  \nShe snapped and said that because of me drug addiction I should look way older and that she always \"deserved\" to look better than me. I talked back and things snowballed into a fight where she kept pointing my short comings in life and how everything I have is unearned. I told her it's not my fault she thinks she's better than everyone and that she's not entitled to look a certain way just because she has money. We haven't talk since.\r  \n\r  \nTo my surprise, our family sided with her. They told me I knew how sensitive she was about her appearence and that she did work hard to get what she wanted. Although I was mad at them because they were teasing her too, I felt guilty because I know these things are true and she probably had these feelings buried inside for a long time.\r  \n\r  \nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1689363178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zprtv/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_doesnt_deserve_to/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bunch of tiresome BS going on here.", "ESH I mean you both took \"teasing\" too far. Like you hit a nerve and I assuming in the fight she hit a nerve.

She deserves to feel beautiful and look how she wants.  She does *not* deserve a family that craps all over her and tears her down.\n\n>she probably had these feelings buried inside for a long time\n\nShe\u2019s not the only one.  Yeah, you said that she is obviously insecure about her appearance.  She isn\u2019t the only one with insecurities - and at least she is doing something about hers.  You attacked her for \u201cthinking she\u2019s better than everyone\u201d - what?  Because she was top of her class?  Got scholarships?  Was an athlete?  *You* have issues, you have problems you are holding against your sister, and you used your family \u201cteasing\u201d her about her surgery as an opportunity to attack her.", "ESH.

Wtf did I just read?\n\nESH!", "YTA- not cool to poke at someone if you know it\u2019s something they are sensitive about. Even if your family is joking, you could have asked them to stop.

I think that all of you were TA a bit. I can definitely understand why you feel the way you do about your sister and how she responded to you would set you off. I also can understand why your sister would lose it with you congratulating her for finally looking younger than you. \n\nI think the joking was mean spirited on both ends, but I don\u2019t think you or anyone are solely to blame. You and your family all need to be able to discuss the situation and maybe come to an agreement that teasing isn\u2019t fun if it\u2019s not fun for all involved and it may not be the way you should have fun with each other going forward. \n\nYou and your sister may not have a great bond, but if you want to clear the air that might not be such a bad idea.

As is everyone in your family who teased her for her insecurities and the cousin who worked your addiction into a wedding toast for a laugh. This isn\u2019t teasing. It\u2019s rude behavior and needs to stop. Laughing at someone\u2019s expense should never be funny", "ESH & your whole family dynamic sounds toxic. The fact your cousin \"joked\" about your addiction during a wedding speech doesn't make it ok, or make it ok to make fun of your sister. The fact you were ok with that but not ok with what your sister said makes it sound like this is more about a sibling rivalry between the two of you more than anyone else. You clearly resent her success in life & she sounds like she thinks you're a loser. Nobody looks good here", "Ouch. Slightly ESH for this particular encounter but your sister is obviously more in the wrong than you are. But you could have been more diplomatic. It sounds there are anger issues on both sides, honestly.\n\nThis said, again, ouch. I think you might be underestimating the problem here. Your sister is really struggling. She has a great life but underwent plastic surgery to look better than you? It's sounds...dangerous, even a little crazy. It sounds like someone who has serious mental health problems.\n\nYou cannot be the one who helps her. But what you can do is get yourself to therapy, and quick, because this screams underlying problems in your family. Sisters do not develop such a twisted, unhealthy relationship when they had a great childhood. Whatever happened, you have been affected also.\n\nYou have a lot to unpack.", "Oof, YTA. Your sister said she deserved to look younger than you after *you* insulted her first by saying that she finally did - meaning, that you looked younger/better than her before. It doesn't sound like she thinks she's better than everyone, it sounds like she has been extremely insecure about her appearance for a long time and has now taken extreme measures to change her looks. You've been her prettier older sister for her whole life and you hit her right where it hurts, on purpose. Your sister is responsible for lashing out at you, but she did so in response to a cruel joke that you shouldn't have made.", "more than enough insecurities to go around...", "YTA. Your jealousy is so so so obvious. People were already teasing her but you had to mention the age thing.

If she is happier that way, it's her problem, just leave her alone.", "ESH and you know it.

I was thinking YTA until your sister whipped out the \"deserving\" card first but YTA more than your sister.

There's a line between banter and bullying, and you crossed it.", "ESH.", "Yes\nYTA You went in on her first along with her family but you seem to be the ring leader and went for the jugular. Just from your starting description you seemed to harbor resentment towards your sister for her accomplishments.\n\nDid you expect she was going to take all your hurtful insults and say nothing? This isn't teasing. This is your sister and you went at every insecurity and twisted the knife until she \"snapped\". You \"talked back\" but once you went into detail further down in the comments you didn't just talk back you doubled down on her and took it to the point of no return. There's probably a reason she lives in another country if this is how \"family\" treats her.\n\nYou may be 'prettier' on the outside but it can't mask being ugly on the inside. Looks only get you so far until you reveal your true self to people. Looks fade no matter how 'young' you think you look now.", "Who gives a shit.
