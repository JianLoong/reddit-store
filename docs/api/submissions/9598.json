Megan is usually out of the room when I have them, but sometimes, she is at the dorm. Megan says she doesn\u2019t mind me playing the trumpet because she can put her earbuds in.\n\nThis afternoon at around three, I was practicing after my Zoom lesson had ended (Megan was not in the room). I got a text from Adina, asking if I would mind not practicing right now. I told her no, it wasn\u2019t quiet hours in the building until ten. She said she could hear it through the wall and she was taking a test. I told her that the building is where a lot of people live, and she could go to the lobby or to another building if she didn\u2019t want to hear me playing the trumpet.\n\nShe came to our door in person and asked me to stop again. I told her politely again that this was my room and I had the right to do what I wanted as long as it wasn\u2019t quiet hours. We got into a huge argument, she left and went somewhere else to study, and I continued to practice.\n\nI told Megan and she said she\u2019s kinda pissed at me since now the four of us probably won\u2019t hang out together now, and we\u2019ve been getting along really well.
