My roommate is Megan, 20F, and she and I have gotten along somewhat well for the most part. Our suitemates, Adina and Cassidy, whom we share a bathroom with, are next door.\n\nI recently (over the past two weeks) started learning how to play trumpet and have been taking private lessons. Megan is usually out of the room when I have them, but sometimes, she is at the dorm. Megan says she doesn\u2019t mind me playing the trumpet because she can put her earbuds in.\n\nThis afternoon at around three, I was practicing after my Zoom lesson had ended (Megan was not in the room). I got a text from Adina, asking if I would mind not practicing right now. I told her no, it wasn\u2019t quiet hours in the building until ten. She said she could hear it through the wall and she was taking a test. I told her that the building is where a lot of people live, and she could go to the lobby or to another building if she didn\u2019t want to hear me playing the trumpet.\n\nShe came to our door in person and asked me to stop again. I told her politely again that this was my room and I had the right to do what I wanted as long as it wasn\u2019t quiet hours. We got into a huge argument, she left and went somewhere else to study, and I continued to practice.\n\nI told Megan and she said she\u2019s kinda pissed at me since now the four of us probably won\u2019t hang out together now, and we\u2019ve been getting along really well. Now I feel like maybe I messed up, but then again I feel like I was following the building rules, so Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1676004813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ygmg7/aita_for_playing_the_trumpet/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are there **music practice rooms** available for students to reserve for *free*?", "YTA. These are people you have to live with for a whole semester. Sharing space with someone requires compromise. Your suitemate wasn\u2019t asking you to never practice, just to give her a little time to finish a test. That seems like a more than reasonable request. The fact that you are following the building rules doesn\u2019t make you not TA. The building rules are the absolute bare minimum of what you should be doing. You could just also be nice on top of the rules.", "YTA. Sounds like they put up with it most of the time, but on this one instance she asked to be able to take a test in a place she's most comfortable to help her get the best possible score and you were a jerk about it.

The polite thing to do would be to stop. Go to the music hall and book a private room..yes it's ok to play your instrument in your room but when it's bothering someone's focus while they are taking a test, you are being rude. Just wait for them to comply with the rules and not be thoughtful and considerate of you... When you live in a community you have to think about other people, not just the rules. Now, if this person was chronically rude or mean, I'd say play all you want.... But they made a reasonable request and yta for not being thoughtful and stopping while they take their test.", "YTA - You couldn't at the very least wait until her test was over to start practicing?

You live on a college campus--you probably have more options for appropriate places to practice your trumpet right now than you ever will in your life. Your dorm room is not one of them.  This goes double because you're not in the marching band or minoring in jazz or anything, you just started playing and it's probably terrible.", "YTA.

Her exam is more important than your hobby.", "She wasn't asking you to stop playing all the time, just while she was taking a TEST. Couldn't you delay practicing for an hour or so? Wouldn't you hate it if someone was practicing their bagpipes or drums (or whatever you find particularly annoying) while you were trying to concentrate or were on an important phone call or taking a test? \n\nYTA, and an inconsiderate one at that. And yes, you ruined friendships with all your suitemates.", "I'm sorry to say, but YTA, in my opinion, here. You wrote that she asked if you wouldn't mind not practicing and then followed by saying she was doing a test. It is important to practice, and while technically you were within the rules, it was something you could have stopped doing for a bit or gone elsewhere, too.

I know in a pinch some people who would practice in the stairwells but in your dorm with a brass instrument is too much.

A trumpet is loud AF", "YTA. \n\nPart of living in a communal place means you have to respect the people you\u2019re living with. Adina was taking a test and you should have had enough respect for her to NOT be playing a loud trumpet while she was doing that. School comes before hobbies. Period. \n\nYou could have gone to another building or gone to the music building and occupied a practice room. But you didn\u2019t. Be more considerate and respectful moving forward please.", "YTA. Go to the practice rooms at the music building for goodness sake. Playing a trumpet (a beginner no less) in a dorm is ridiculous. I was a music major and this idea never once crossed my mind.", "YTA and speaking as a RA, while it wasn\u2019t quiet hours you could still get in trouble.

Literally no one wants to listen to it", "YTA. You are likely terrible at the trumpet since you just started, and it is a super loud instrument.  That would be annoying AF to have to listen to. You are likely annoying ALL of the residents in the dorm that are in the same floor and the floors above and below you.

After you get it, go back over to your neighbor and show it to her and tell her you will try to be more accommodating in the future.  You can\u2019t help that she was taking a test but an open lobby is also a poor choice for concentration.  If you want life to go back to normal, own it, apologize and use the mute.  It will still be loud enough for your Zoom teacher to be able to tell if you are on key and if you are hitting the right rests and tongue positions and it is streamlined so that your teacher can see your fingering and whether you are being lazy and bending your wrist or puffing out your cheeks.
