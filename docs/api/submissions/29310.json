Normally, if we\u2019re both home (such as on the weekend), we\u2019ll do the laundry together and fold/put away our own clothes. \n\n\n\nHowever, if I get home early during the week and notice the laundry bin is full, I\u2019ll just do it myself and fold/put everything away because it seems silly to wait until she gets home. \n\n\n\nThe other day, I had a work related emergency and didn\u2019t get home until about 10pm. My wife had decided to do a load of laundry which was great, but  when I went to crawl into bed, I realized she had put all her clothes away but left mine on my side of the bed. This meant I had to spend 10 minutes folding and putting away clothes before I could even lay down. \n\n\n\nWhile spending 10 minutes putting clothes away isn\u2019t typically an issue, it was the last thing I wanted to do after a 13 hour work day and dealing with a crisis situation (I\u2019m a child psychologist at an inpatient facility). Leaving my clothes on the bed and unfolded felt petty. While never asked for, it\u2019s a courtesy I always do for her when the situation is reversed and I know she appreciates it.\n\n\n\nShe claims that she didn\u2019t want to do a load of laundry to begin with, but needed clean work scrubs for the morning and that she was too tired to put everything away. She thinks I\u2019m being an AH for expecting her to wash and put away my clothes. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH since I regularly do it for her if she\u2019s not home. I told her at the very least she could have left my clothes downstairs rather than piled on my side of the bed, forcing me to deal with it before I could go to sleep.\n\n\n\nETA: This is not a serious issue or even an argument. The next morning I made a half hearted  comment about it and she also joked about it, saying something along the lines of \u201csurely you\u2019re not asking your wife to do all your laundry.\u201d", "created_utc": 1697817033, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ceg6n/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_put_my_laundry_away/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's the only possible solution.\n\n(for real, you guys can afford to hire someone to do all of your laundry so do that and problem solved - sounds like you already have enough stress in your life)", "\"Hey I love you but I'm a little upset about what happened not because of the laundry but because I feel like the effort that I put in to make your life a little easier is not being reciprocated and I don't want this problem to spiral in our marriage and make us be petty to each other. I'm more worried about you not understanding where I'm coming from on this and I hope that you can try to understand.\"", "NTA... we tend to expect reciprocal treatment. It doesn't always happen. You didn't demand it, you were just dissapointed.", "NAH. Acts of service might be a love language for you but not her, so she didn\u2019t think through leaving the clothes as more work for you.", "NTA.", "NTA - A relationship is never 50/50, more like 60/40. And in good relationships both try to be the part that gives 60.", "NAH\n\nIf you normally put her clothes away, it would have been courteous for her to put yours away too. That said, sometimes we all have terrible days and sometimes I get the laundry out of the dryer and am too exhausted to fold it so it just gets dumped in piles around the house until the next day. (thank you, chronic illness.) So I think if you were truly exhausted, laundry could have gone in a basket until the next day and unless she does this all the time, I wouldn't worry about it.", "NTA but also probably not worth making it as big of a deal as you are.\n\nMaybe not all households are the same, but for me, whoever does the laundry puts it all away, or you\u2019re not finishing the task.", "NTA. your wife is petty AF", "NAH. \n\nYou split things 50/50 so usually you would fold your own laundry so this situation isn't different. Would it have been nice if she? But that doesn't make her an asshole for not doing it. It you push the issue further, then you are probably the asshole.\n\nPersonally, I would rather my partner put my laundry of the bed so I can just take care of it right there instead of going downstairs. It wasn't a obviously better thing to do, to leave it downstairs. Now you are just expecting her to know in advance how late you will be coming home, how you would feel, how tough of a day you had and if you would need/prefer to fold laundry now or Tomorrow. That's not reasonable to expect your wife to know how the whole day would be and feel to you.\n\nBut honest question here. You say you fold her laundry when you can, but she doesn't. Is this an isolated situation or a regular occurrence? And I don't necessarily mean the laundry, but favor in general. Because if an similar event happen from time to time, you need to let it go. But if you are in a one sided relationship where you often go out of your way to help her and she rarely return the favor, then you have another issue than just folding laundry.", "If past relationships have taught me anything, you need to go full petty/passive aggressive, and politely thank her for doing the laundry, then never fold hers again. NAH.", "NAH I guess? \n\nWho does any other independent adults laundry for them at all is more my question?\n\nMy spouse and I and our kids, all do our own laundry. I can\u2019t imagine knowing what another person might need done, having to set aside the mental space for that\u2026and then trying to figure out where and how they like their clothes folded and stored? No way. \n\nIf I need more stuff to make a load I use towels or sheets. Not someone else\u2019s clothes. \n\nGawd\u2026 I went thru enough trauma doing my kids\u2019 laundry as they hit school age to last me a lifetime. Taught them how to do it real quick. \n\nYou grown. Do it yourself.", "NTA, but your wife is, you do it for her and she'll happily take it without comment but won't do it in return even when you ask?", "NTA\n\nSo SHE is the one who needed fresh scrubs, so SHE chose to do a load of laundry. It literally takes the same amount of energy to fold an item and stack it up, as it does to pick an item out of the bunch and toss it to your side of the bed. So, for whatever reason, she WAS being petty.\n\nOh btw you didnt expect her to wash and put away your clothes. You put your clothes in the laundry and if she hadnt needed her scrubs, and hadnt done the load of wash, you could have been the one who ended up doing the wash and folding the clean laundry.", "NTA. Now, see, in a way I get the 50/50 thing, and the being too tired to put everything away part... but then, she didn't do just half, she did HER HALF and then made sure to make it mandatory for you to do the rest before bed. That makes her the AH.", "She is an inconsiderate AH", "NTA, but I would stop putting away her laundry for her then. Treat her the way she treats you. You both work demanding jobs. She should understand you were tired. Not to mention that you do it for her.", "NTA\n\nYour wife was both selfish (only folding her own clothes) and passive-aggressive (putting your clothes on the bed where you'd have to deal with them).\n\nYour approach is fair and generous, and you should be able to expect to have it reciprocated. Her argument that you are \"expecting her to wash and put away your clothes\" sounds like weaponized anti-sexism to me. It would be true if you both worked and you expected her to do it all the time while not doing it yourself. In your circumstances, she's being a total AH.", "NTA but if this really bothers you I would get separate laundry bins for your clothes and then you both do your own laundry. If she doesn\u2019t like that arrangement and enjoys you doing her laundry and folding it and putting it away then she should be prepared to return the act", "NAH. You guys need a laundry basket.", "NTA but I'm sure you can simply tell her why this was an issue for you. Your entire profession is based on finding ways around hard emotional and psychological issues but you're coming to reddit instead of just telling your wife something like 'Hey, the other night when you didn't put up my laundry too made me feel like the things I've been doing to make your life easier are becoming one sided' and going from there.\n\nI've no doubt it can be worked out without the drama", "NTA", "NTA \nWhen it's a regular thing you do for her it's not unreasonable to think she could once do it too. \n\nBut the decision to neatly fold and put away the clothes instead of just putting them to the side and get some much needed sleep was yours.", "YTA. Put your clothes on the floor and deal with them later. No one says you have to put them away there and then. Yes, it would've been nice if your wife had, but she didn't. It's not that big of a deal.", "Extremly ignorant and petty. NTA", "YTA - but, only for expecting her to put your stuff away. Otherwise, you sound like a decent hubby. In my home, the hubby and I are responsible for our own laundry and don\u2019t have any expectations of one and other to expect otherwise. It is nice when you put her stuff away and I am sure she appreciates it, but she isn\u2019t obliged to reciprocate any favor and neither are you.", "NAH\n\nWhen it is about the chores, it is never the chores, what it is all about. Such speaks experience. Maybe you two need a spa weekend with a bit of talking, every once in a while.", "I'm going to go with NAH. It sounds like you and your wife both had a hard day at work that day. And it sounds like for the most part, even though she doesn't fully put your clothes away, she normally folds them and puts them somewhere out of the way. Its fair youre frustrated, but at the end of the day, this is the type of thing where in a relationship you both should be giving some grace to each other. She should realize that leaving the clothes on your side of the bed wasn't very considerate, and you should realize that it sounds like she also had a tiring day and didn't have energy for one more step.\n\nThere are also lots of people saying she's a bad partner because you fold and put away her clothes if you do laundry, but she just folds your clothes and doesn't fully put them away if she does laundry. I'd like to take a moment to remind people that there's almost certainly a different chore where she might go a bit above and beyond what he does. In general, nitpicking down to the tiniest detail isn't really that healthy in relationships. If they both feel like they're splitting things 50/50, that's what matters.", "NTA -She was already putting her stuff away. It wouldn't have taken more than five or ten minutes to do it all. Tired or not, this wasn't going to cut into her sleep time in a meaningful way.\n\nYou are meant to be a team. This means that when one can't do something, the other picks up the slack. It's not about keeping score. Once you get into that game, it has the potential to become a mine of toxicity from both partners. \n\nEvery relationship requires some give and take. Sometimes, one takes or gives more than the other, but that is meant to balance out, not be the norm. You're not the asshole here, but I suggest that you have a discussion about working as a team and helping each other out instead of being petty.", "But you didn\u2019t *have* to fold and put them away just because they were on the bed. You could have put them on the floor, in a basket, on top of the dresser, on a chair. \n\nIf someone is doing  something extra, they get to choose how to do it. You choose to fold and put away her clothes. That\u2019s awesome but the world isn\u2019t tit for tat. That\u2019s not what she does. She probably does stuff that you don\u2019t think to do.\n\nMove on. \n\nI don\u2019t think this is quite worth a YTA, but this is where you posted, so that\u2019s what you get.", "NTA. When you\u2019re in a relationship, you help each other out. Who cares if it\u2019s normally 50/50? She knew you were working late, and having a long day. The bare minimum she could have done was fold your laundry. I would feel incredibly frustrated if my boyfriend did this. When he has long or bad days, I take care of shit. When I do, he takes care of shit.", " YTA.   Be grateful she helped you out that far.   She can get a divorce and support herself.   And, she can have a peaceful life without being on the receiving end of your petty, fussy crap.", "NTA - Putting the clothes on your side of the bed *was* petty, or at least inconsiderate. If she didn\u2019t have the energy to put them away, which happens, then it\u2019d make sense to keep them downstairs or somewhere out of the way until they could be dealt with in the morning. Putting them on your side of the bed just made an unnecessary inconvenience for you.", "Next time you do the dishes, put her half of them under her pillow.", "NAH. You're married - communicate with each other, but do so when you're not both tired from what sounds like two demanding jobs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
