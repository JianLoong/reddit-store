Best if your parents can agree to collate the days and maybe over the time spend it at your dads at a stretch than being miserable every weekend. Your quality of life is important as well and when you are 18 you can decide for yourself what you want to do. Best to move out and see your parents when you want to.", "NAH, none of you are in the wrong. It\u2019s your decision if you want to go or not, like is seeing your dad every second weekend worth losing energy and time? Or is it worth it. Just make sure to try and make it clear that this has nothing to do with anyone expect for the driving difference", "NTA your dad moved he can't force you to fit around his schedule and life decisions.  Your compromise works better.  That's way too long a trip to be doing that regularly.", "Your dad can come in and stay in your town and visit with you.  Saves money on gas, he can shift that money to housing.  Spend time with him, no riding in the car, everyone wins.", "NTA. I don't know if it would work but can't you ask your dad to come to your city once a month and sleep at a hotel? He choose to move so he should be the one to find a way to be with you.", "NTA. And your dad isn't either honestly, I'd just say your mom is. 8 hour round trip is crazy to make every other weekend, especially carsick. It's just a sucky situation. But certainly not something you should have suck up.", "NTA. It doesn't sound shitty, it doesn't make you a bad son. \nYou're entitled to your own life and if you have half your weekends taken away, it leaves you with little time to do that. It might be hard for your dad in the short term but he'll get used to it. He needs to understand that you're an adult and have your own life.", "NTA. It's unfortunate your dad had to move but it's completely unreasonable to expect you to spend a large chunk of your weekend in the car. Set aside time to call or FaceTime occasionally and see him on school breaks when you can stay a bit longer.", "NAH. OP, if a 16 year old is getting that exhausted & sick by \u2018all\u2019 that car time, then your parents need to get you to the doctor for a through check up.  Your father is putting in DOUBLE the transportation time that you are trying to maintain his relationship with you.  No wonder he is incredibly hurt by your rejection.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I seem to remember reading that people that get motion sick in a car have only a 15% (Or some other relatively low number) chance of being sick if they are the one driving. It stems from some sort of being the one in control thing combined with the concentration needed for driving. It takes their mind off the nausea. Maybe this could be a work around? If it is the 8 hours out of his weekend thing too, then forget I said anything.", "NAH because your dad agreed to it. (Actually, your mom has an AH opinion, but if she also allows the change, then I guess she's also fine here.)\n\nYou need to enjoy your life; that's a ridiculous way to spend every other weekend.\n\nMaybe your dad could arrange to visit your town, spend some Saturdays together doing things like museums, concerts, whatever you're both into. Then he can make the commute, and you wouldn't have to. As you said, you can enjoy longer periods (like time in the summer), just not sacrifice every Friday and Sunday to this misery.\n\nYou are not a bad son. FaceTime your dad some Saturdays, keep the communication going, and enjoy the non-car-sick weekends!", "Can you fly?\n\nIs there anything you can do about getting car sick?", "NTA, but at least it sounds like your father wants to see you. After my parents divorce my father only took partial custody was to hurt my mother. He never cared for us and basically just ignored us when we were over. He would intentionally be late picking up and dropping off and would show up falling down drunk and the sheriff's would force us to leave with him. Trust me, it could be far, FAR worse.", "Can you increase your contact with your father in other ways, such as doing video chats, nightly or every other day?\n\nI understand  your position.  If you are susceptible for motion sickness, a two hour car ride is miserable.\n\nWould your mother be willing to let you stay with father over most of the summer?\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Just because she is your mom, doesn't mean she knows what is best for you.  She might mean well, but that doesn't change how much you hate doing this routine, and you don't have to accept her judgment over your own internal guidance system.  \n\n8 hours of travel on a weekend is a lot.  And having only one day of quality time every time you sacrifice two is not a good tradeoff.  I wouldn't want to be that way either.  \n\nThis doesn't make you a bad son.  You are becoming your own person and starting to establish boundaries.  You are in the in-between stage where you start to know what you can accept, but you don't have money or freedom to execute it, and also your parents still see the moments where you haven't figured things out yet as proof you are only a child.", "NAH, why can\u2019t you do it once a month and your dad come to your town and stay in a motel (maybe you can even stay with him?) once a month? \n\nI\u2019d recommend that you suggest that, and say that you understand it might be too expensive but that you\u2019d be happy for that. That way he can see you want to see him but that you don\u2019t want your physical wellbeing to suffer. Frequent travel is exhausting, especially if you get sick and you are totally within your rights to not want to spend your weekends feeling ill!!", "If we meet halfway everybody still has to drive for four hours.", "How is the mom an ah? It's not her fault he had to move for work and the op sounds like this was a him decision. And her comment sounds like she wants them to maintain a relationship", "True, but then it is a total of 4 hours, not 8.  I don't think you are an AH. I don't think anyone is in this scenario.  I also get that at 16 your social life is drastically changing while school work is increasingly demanding.  And if you are interested in sports or clubs that visiting schedule makes that next to impossible, not to mention if you are wanting to start working a little bit.  There are a lot of things that make this incredibly difficult. \n\nBut I do want to point out that your dad is still showing up and obviously cares about you deeply to be making those trips also.  I might suggest thinking about the different reasons I posted above and writing down the ones that are true for you and thinking about the other things you currently can't do living in two different places.  Then sit down and talk to your dad about it.  Let him know you truly don't hate him, but that you are entering a part of your life when you need to start laying a foundation to be a successful adult, and living in two different homes that are 4 hours apart is too demanding.  I have a feeling the stress this has caused you has probably become apparent in your visits and maybe you dad has attributed it as a reflection of your relationship with each other instead of the living situation. \n\nTell him you are committed to the relationship also and make plans to talk frequently, FaceTime, zoom etc. It doesn't have to be a long conversation. But I'm sure it would help him know the relationship is important to you.  Maybe even make plans to screen share a movie or show together.   And share with him your excitement when you start engaging in activities you couldn't with the old schedule.  Tell him the details, how much you are enjoying and learning, the friends you are making.  Just make sure you also work to keep him involved in your life since that will be harder when you don't physically see each other as frequently. \n\nSorry to go on a rant.  I just think you are taking a very important step and hope you can help ease your dad's concerns.", "OP still would be doing 4 hours each way. Just in two different cars.", "How? He drives two hours and spends day with dad at central location, drives two hours back to mom's. Four hours total, in one day."]}
