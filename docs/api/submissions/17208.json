Best if your parents can agree to collate the days and maybe over the time spend it at your dads at a stretch than being miserable every weekend. Your quality of life is important as well and when you are 18 you can decide for yourself what you want to do. Best to move out and see your parents when you want to.", "NAH, none of you are in the wrong. It\u2019s your decision if you want to go or not, like is seeing your dad every second weekend worth losing energy and time? Or is it worth it. Just make sure to try and make it clear that this has nothing to do with anyone expect for the driving difference", "NTA your dad moved he can't force you to fit around his schedule and life decisions.  Your compromise works better.  That's way too long a trip to be doing that regularly.", "Your dad can come in and stay in your town and visit with you.  Saves money on gas, he can shift that money to housing.  Spend time with him, no riding in the car, everyone wins.", "NTA. I don't know if it would work but can't you ask your dad to come to your city once a month and sleep at a hotel? He choose to move so he should be the one to find a way to be with you.", "NTA. And your dad isn't either honestly, I'd just say your mom is. 8 hour round trip is crazy to make every other weekend, especially carsick. It's just a sucky situation. But certainly not something you should have suck up.", "NTA. It doesn't sound shitty, it doesn't make you a bad son. \nYou're entitled to your own life and if you have half your weekends taken away, it leaves you with little time to do that. It might be hard for your dad in the short term but he'll get used to it. He needs to understand that you're an adult and have your own life.", "NTA. It's unfortunate your dad had to move but it's completely unreasonable to expect you to spend a large chunk of your weekend in the car. Set aside time to call or FaceTime occasionally and see him on school breaks when you can stay a bit longer.", "NAH. OP, if a 16 year old is getting that exhausted & sick by \u2018all\u2019 that car time, then your parents need to get you to the doctor for a through check up.  Your father is putting in DOUBLE the transportation time that you are trying to maintain his relationship with you.  No wonder he is incredibly hurt by your rejection.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. \n\nI'm curious if the OP has his license. I seem to remember reading that people that get motion sick in a car have only a 15% (Or some other relatively low number) chance of being sick if they are the one driving. It stems from some sort of being the one in control thing combined with the concentration needed for driving. It takes their mind off the nausea. Maybe this could be a work around? If it is the 8 hours out of his weekend thing too, then forget I said anything.", "NAH because your dad agreed to it. (Actually, your mom has an AH opinion, but if she also allows the change, then I guess she's also fine here.)\n\nYou need to enjoy your life; that's a ridiculous way to spend every other weekend.\n\nMaybe your dad could arrange to visit your town, spend some Saturdays together doing things like museums, concerts, whatever you're both into. Then he can make the commute, and you wouldn't have to. As you said, you can enjoy longer periods (like time in the summer), just not sacrifice every Friday and Sunday to this misery.\n\nYou are not a bad son. FaceTime your dad some Saturdays, keep the communication going, and enjoy the non-car-sick weekends!", "Can you fly?\n\nIs there anything you can do about getting car sick?", "NTA, but at least it sounds like your father wants to see you. After my parents divorce my father only took partial custody was to hurt my mother. He never cared for us and basically just ignored us when we were over. He would intentionally be late picking up and dropping off and would show up falling down drunk and the sheriff's would force us to leave with him. Trust me, it could be far, FAR worse.", "Can you increase your contact with your father in other ways, such as doing video chats, nightly or every other day?\n\nI understand  your position.  If you are susceptible for motion sickness, a two hour car ride is miserable.\n\nWould your mother be willing to let you stay with father over most of the summer?\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Just because she is your mom, doesn't mean she knows what is best for you.  She might mean well, but that doesn't change how much you hate doing this routine, and you don't have to accept her judgment over your own internal guidance system.  \n\n8 hours of travel on a weekend is a lot.  And having only one day of quality time every time you sacrifice two is not a good tradeoff.  I wouldn't want to be that way either.  \n\nThis doesn't make you a bad son.  You are becoming your own person and starting to establish boundaries.  You are in the in-between stage where you start to know what you can accept, but you don't have money or freedom to execute it, and also your parents still see the moments where you haven't figured things out yet as proof you are only a child.", "NAH, why can\u2019t you do it once a month and your dad come to your town and stay in a motel (maybe you can even stay with him?) once a month? \n\nI\u2019d recommend that you suggest that, and say that you understand it might be too expensive but that you\u2019d be happy for that. That way he can see you want to see him but that you don\u2019t want your physical wellbeing to suffer. Frequent travel is exhausting, especially if you get sick and you are totally within your rights to not want to spend your weekends feeling ill!!", "If we meet halfway everybody still has to drive for four hours.", "How is the mom an ah? It's not her fault he had to move for work and the op sounds like this was a him decision. And her comment sounds like she wants them to maintain a relationship", "True, but then it is a total of 4 hours, not 8.  I don't think you are an AH. I don't think anyone is in this scenario.  I also get that at 16 your social life is drastically changing while school work is increasingly demanding.  And if you are interested in sports or clubs that visiting schedule makes that next to impossible, not to mention if you are wanting to start working a little bit.  There are a lot of things that make this incredibly difficult. \n\nBut I do want to point out that your dad is still showing up and obviously cares about you deeply to be making those trips also.  I might suggest thinking about the different reasons I posted above and writing down the ones that are true for you and thinking about the other things you currently can't do living in two different places.  Then sit down and talk to your dad about it.  Let him know you truly don't hate him, but that you are entering a part of your life when you need to start laying a foundation to be a successful adult, and living in two different homes that are 4 hours apart is too demanding.  I have a feeling the stress this has caused you has probably become apparent in your visits and maybe you dad has attributed it as a reflection of your relationship with each other instead of the living situation. \n\nTell him you are committed to the relationship also and make plans to talk frequently, FaceTime, zoom etc. It doesn't have to be a long conversation. But I'm sure it would help him know the relationship is important to you.  Maybe even make plans to screen share a movie or show together.   And share with him your excitement when you start engaging in activities you couldn't with the old schedule.  Tell him the details, how much you are enjoying and learning, the friends you are making.  Just make sure you also work to keep him involved in your life since that will be harder when you don't physically see each other as frequently. \n\nSorry to go on a rant.  I just think you are taking a very important step and hope you can help ease your dad's concerns.", "OP still would be doing 4 hours each way. Just in two different cars.", "How? He drives two hours and spends day with dad at central location, drives two hours back to mom's. Four hours total, in one day.", "NTA. The situation sucks, but you're getting the worst of it and that's not fair to you. You had no say, you made no choices, you should bear as little burden of the choices adults have made as possible. I'm sure your dad's feelings are hurt, but his feelings are NOT your responsibility. Your parents chose to divorce, your dad chose to move farther away. I'm sure those choices were hard to make, but they do come with consequences. You need to prioritize your own mental health and physical well-being.", "YTA, suck it up kid, you have a parent who cares.", "NAH\n\nYou should discuss options, once a month? Long weekends? Him coming to see you for the day.", "NTA \n\nI get carsick easily and I would hate to spend a portion of every weekend very sick", "That's bullshit. Children are not on the hook to pay for adult choices. A child doesn't owe a parent the same effort a parent owes a child.", "The age old reply of people who don\u2019t have insight or empathy.  The situation is crappy for all around.  NAH.", "If they cared just a little bit more, they wouldn\u2019t guilt trip son for their mistakes", "I don\u2019t think the driver can get car sick. It\u2019s to do with you knowing what the car is going to do", "Yeah but it'd be 4 hours not 8 it does half the time.", "For telling him to suck it up and go. He's 16, setting a reasonable boundary - mom should be supportive.", "Nta,  if I was your dad I would drive to you, stay in a hotel at least once a month, and hope you would come the other weekend", "NTA\n\nIt might be unfair to your father but he moved a significant distance. I get that it is job related but it still ultimately was the father's decision.\n\nPresumably when your father lived closer, not only was the commute to his home much shorter, but you were still reasonably close to your friends and school activities as most 16 year olds have an active schedule of school, friends, after school activities etc.\n\nI would also think it would impact your school work as well. When I was in high school I had papers and at least one day on the weekend would be necessary for homework, papers, studying etc.", "NTA\u2026tell dad you do not hate him, but this drive is killing you.  He chose to move four hours away, he has to accept that that drive us but feasible for you.  Although, if your mom is also upset about it, maybe she could drive two hours one way and meet dad in the middle where you can get a break from the car ride for a bit.  Bet that won\u2019t pan out.", "NAH - But just be honest, the weekend is when you want to hang out with your friends instead of your parents at 16. Tell your dad this. Most kids friends are more important than parents at 16, it\u2019s normal. Right now he just thinks he\u2019s not worth any effort on your part, which might be true. But you owe him honesty atleast. Most of us have been in your shoes at some point.", "NTA he shouldn't have moved and why isn't he driving to pick you up instead?", "NTA. Often with that sort of distance, parents switch to a long distance parenting plan. Every other weekend just isn\u2019t practical at that distance. As you said, it is miserable for everyone involved.", "YTA", "Who said he \"had\" to? Sounded like a personal choice to me.", "This. I get horrendous car sickness I\u2019m the back seat, and when I\u2019m the passenger it\u2019s often enough. But I\u2019ve only gotten car sick a handful of times while I\u2019m the driver, and every instance was either the start of a sinus infection or a gallbladder attack so there was another reason.", "So I get very carsick myself and am learning to drive. Most of the time it is alright. Except for those swoopy hills, the ones that go up then down really quickly. Or a lot of turns in a row. It makes me dizzy. \n\nI hope the OP is not one of the ones who get carsick while driving, but also ouch 8 hours a weekend lost.  Could he take a night bus/train and sleep?", "The driver absolutely can get car sick.  I'm usually okay if I'm driving, but if it is really windy or in certain cars I'll still get sick.  It's way better than being a passenger, though.", "But a 2 or 4 hour car ride should not leave an otherwise healthy 16 year old so exhausted they they can\u2019t do anything for the rest of the day.\n\nA through checkup won\u2019t hurt. And the doctor might be able to prescribe anti-motion sickness medication or provide some other relief to make the car rides less draining.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the visits to Dad. OP\u2019s life will be limited if they can\u2019t ride in a car for even two hours without being exhausted. I\u2019m surprised OP made it this long without it being an issue\u2014school field trips, family vacations\u2014all sorts of things require long car rides.", "the commenter isn't suggesting that they meet in the middle and then continue to dad's house, they're suggesting that they meet in the middle and do an activity there.", "NAH (though I\u2019m side-eyeing your mom for not being more constructive). You\u2019re so wiped out by the car-sickness that you can\u2019t actually enjoy spending time with your dad. Your dad is deeply sad that he\u2019s losing even more time with you because he loves you dearly. But this situation isn\u2019t sustainable.   \n\n\nI don\u2019t know what your financial situations are, but could your dad come to your city and stay in a motel? Or could you change things up, so you spend longer with him during school breaks? Are there other transport options that are affordable/feasible? Can you and your dad take long weekends/mini-breaks that you can plan together? Can you talk to each other about things you can do together so that your relationship doesn\u2019t falter - even something as basic as playing an online game together keeps you in each others lives. It\u2019s not on you to square this circle this all by yourself, but I suspect you\u2019ll reassure your dad that you\u2019re not rejecting him if you can initiate that talk.", "NTA. He\u2019s the one who moved away. As someone who also gets terrible car sickness, I feel your pain. There are anti car sickness glasses on Amazon that takes the edge off. Do you get less sick if you do the driving? \nI think you are offering a reasonable compromise. He chose to move away and you are paying the price. Longer visits less often will allow you to actually spend time together instead of you just recovering.", "NTA. Honestly, your parents suck for asking or expecting you to keep that insane schedule in the first place.", "This plan could maybe work, but it\u2019s not financially beneficial in any way as you\u2019re suggesting. \n\nDo you have any idea how expensive hotels are? Significantly more expensive than gas\u2026 Not to mention the extra money you are forced to spend on food and activities because you have to eat out and don\u2019t have the usual things you would at home for entertainment."]}
