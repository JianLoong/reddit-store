He wasn't there till 18:30 by which time there were no more spots left and he was turned away by the organizers. I was in the middle of a game and didn't leave with him. I texted that I would leave as soon as this game ended. He said to take my time. However, I had really been looking forward to this evening, even if it didn't go as per plan. So I kept playing some more games, finally leaving at 20:00.

From your description, he was understanding of this though.\n\nYou shouldn't tell him you'll leave as soon as this current game ends, then continue to play more games.", "ESH. He was an hour later than his planned time. That\u2019s super late. Not the asshole for not leaving in the middle of your game but you\u2019re the asshole for playing some more games after you said you\u2019d leave during the first game", "He should have been on time and you shouldn't have told him you would leave after the current game if you had no intention of doing so.

This is simple miscommunication. He should have been more clear, if he wanted you to leave earlier, so you could hang out. You should have responded with, \"Ok, I'll play another game or two & plan on leaving around 8.\"", "You two sound like you really have a great relationship.", "ESH. Both of you are a match made in heaven- you both have zero regards to other people time.\n\nHe was late to a scheduled organized event (and even asking to save a seat for 30min is s**ty, when there are multiple people that did arrive in time)\n\nBut you then not telling him that you are staying and letting him wait for an hour and half?", "Info - what was he up to for the 1hr30 before you left and did you keep him up updated as to how long you'd be?", "YTA, because you told your boyfriend you would leave after a game and did in fact the opposite. He might be upset because you did that to him rather than you staying and playing, because the difference is large. You should have just told him you wanted to spend your evening at the event.", "YTA.  If the plan was to do something together, not specifically board games, then YOU ditched bf. If the plan was board games, then It would be tough shit for bf because he was late.", "YTA for telling your boyfriend you would leave as soon as your game was over, but instead you kept playing just because you wanted to have fun and you didn't care that your boyfriend was on his own. You'd made plans to do something together. Since your original plan fell apart, you should have finished your game and left to go do something else together.", "NTA Oh! I (36f) want to comment on this. A long time ago I planned to go to a Friday Night Magic the Gathering tournament that started promptly at 7pm. This one of the few game nights I actually very much looked forward to back then. My boyfriend at the time knew this and would always ask me to \"leave early\" so we could spend time together. So anyone that is not familiar with MtG tournaments, if you make it into the final rounds you can be there almost until 10pm or later. I once was in the final round and I was super excited about even making it that far. He texted me asking if I could \"cut it short\" so I could spend time with him (at Burger King) no less at 9pm. I said no and that he should be excited for me! Instead he just said there is no way I was that good at MtG and I was just there because I'm a \"chick\" and it's because dudes liked that. He also accused me of cheating on him with another guy that plays the game. Well, of course I didn't leave and lo and behold I find him at the Burger King making out with some other \"chick\" in our class.\n\nSo anyways, that was the end of that relationship. But either way. No, you are not in the wrong for making a commitment to a gaming night that has very strict timing as to when it starts and typically when it could end. Your boyfriend's slight \"butthurtness\" could have been avoided if he showed up when it started. If he respected you enough he would have been there on time to spend together with \\*you\\* and not been sad that \\*you\\* didn't want to leave early (as per the original plan) to spend time with him. And yes, if it was both of your original plans to probably spend the entire night there it's not really your fault you wanted to capitalize on that. I mean, if he had shown up at the time as he said you probably wouldn't even be having the conversation. Takes two to tango...Also verbatim he told you to \"take your time\" and should have respected the fact that you love game nights and shouldn't have to leave early if you changed your mind. Yes, people might get on the fact that you didn't leave after finishing that one game. But hey, I figure he could have easily found something else to do and respected your decision to enjoy the night to the fullest.", "NTA.\n\nBoyfriend apparently thinks it's just fine to be an hour and a half late when the plan is to do something together with OP.\n\nOP then played for another hour and a half after boyfriend left.\n\nSounds about right.", "Your bf turned up an hour and a half late for your evening plans. That's on him - he has no reason to be upset with you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's his own damn fault for showing up late.  He also told you to take your time.  So he actually can't legitimately claim to be mad at you at all.\n\nI guess he was expecting you to just skip out in the middle of a game.  If he were, he'd be expecting you to be an asshole to the other players, right?\n\nSo if that happened and you guys went back there, you'd be looked at as an asshole to the other players.  Might not even get to play if anyone made a stink about it.", "\n\n>My boyfriend isn't exactly mad at me but it feels like he might be unhappy that i didn't leave earlier to be with him since the initial plan was to do something together.\n\nNTA- he got there late and missed out. That's his own fault. He would've gotten there on time if he actually cared about doing something together.", "NTA he said to take your time and had already run late entries to ruin it as a joint activity. Being so late he can't join in ruined it as a date night and you still got back at a reasonable hour.", "NAH. If he was waiting around for you though you should have communicated that you were staying longer.", "NTA\n\nYour BF should have gotten there on time", "NTA, you both knew what time the event started to be there, and he was more than an hour late. You weren't obligated to leave due to his lack of time management, unless there was an emergency reason.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why is your boyfriend with you? Why are you with him if you'd rather play boardgames? And to lie to him to play more boardgames?", "How does he suck if he was understanding that him being late meant he couldn't play?", "This", "The boyfriend said he would be there at 5:30 and got there at 6:30, unless I\u2019m mistaken he was an hour late. But agreed, would be good to know why he was so late!", "He said he\u2019d be there by 17:30, so plan was board games. (Together, so he broke the contract first.)", "I'm not up on board game culture, but it doesn't sound like this was a tournament. If this was a game night with more than one group playing, it seems odd that the BF couldn't hang around & get in when a new game started. I'm guessing he had to work late & was bummed in part because he wanted to play games, too.\n\nYour ex BF is a flaming AH, though!", "You skipped the part where OP said she would leave after the current game. \n\nEven though she was in the right beforehand, she did lie to her boyfriend.", "Except she said she was going to leave and then didn\u2019t tell him that she was actually going to stay and play? That seems like TA to me.", "Because he was late. If you are 1h30min late to an event you are an AH, especially if you were supposed to meet someone there in time.", "Good point. I guess the administrators wouldn't let him in but that was earlier in the night. I've never even been to a table top game night that has a closed session  the \\*entire\\* night unless it was over capacity. Must be a good group!", "Yep, I did skip that part. I also skipped the part where the boyfriend said he would get there by 7:30.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure OP *lied*. Perhaps she was having so much fun she changed her mind.", ">If you are 1h30min late to an event you are an AH\n\nIf it's a pattern of behaviour then you're an AH. But sometimes you get stuck in a meeting at work, or your train breaks down, or there's an accident that causes a traffic jam.", ">However, I had really been looking forward to this evening, even if it didn't go as per plan. So I kept playing some more games, finally leaving at 20:00.\n\nI\u2019m not blaming OP, because I would have done the same. But she did choose to continue playing when she said she would finish up the game and leave. So she brought that on herself. \n\nHer boyfriend saying he\u2019ll be there at 17:30 (5:30p) makes me think he was coming from work. Which would explain how he could have ended up being later. It also sounds like he was turned away due to capacity rather than because he was late.\n\nReally they just need to talk it out, because this really isn\u2019t that big of an issue.", "And if you trust the person you could ask what happened.  If they say \u201cI was busy getting stoned\u201d they\u2019re probably TA.", "I agree, I should've left sooner. But he said he was walking home after he was turned away. It takes ~1-1.5 hours to walk to my place from there so I thought I could stay longer and then take the bus. I ended up staying a bit longer so I made it home about 30 minutes after he did. I also informed him that I am staying longer and he seemed kind of okay with it. I am wondering if I should have left mid-game with him so we were not in this situation at all? And we had got the entire evening together?", "He actually started walking home right after he was turned away, that walk takes about 1-1.5 hours so he wasn't really waiting for me. I didn't know how to catch up to him after the game ended so I kept playing and thought I'd catch a bus later to reach the same time as him. However I ended up reaching about 30 minutes- 1 hour after him.", "He said he was stuck at work, went to a specific, out of the way fueling station to refuel since it is discounted for him. I think he didn't know he wouldn't be let in if late, I didn't know either that that was a thing.", "Yes, you are right on that.", "We had no idea that he could get turned away. I have never been late to it and he was with me once before and we were on time. So we didn't strategize on that. We strategized a bit on saving a spot or maybe him joining me as a team when I was mid-game but none of that worked. \n\nOne of the many things we do together, it was not a rare night but this boardgames night itself happens once in 2 weeks and we both enjoy it so it is something to look forward to. \n\nYes, I told him I would stay longer but not exactly how long, I didn't know either.", "I don't think that was the point they were making. It's not that you should have left sooner. Why? You were responsible enough to get there on time, and your boyfriend was rude to make you wait 90 minutes. It's just that you should have been honest and said you were going to stay because this was something you had been looking forward to.\n\nBut regardless, he's more of an AH than you in my opinion. He essentially stood you up.", "Yes, they were very full last night and said they have a strict policy to not let people in once they reach full capacity. \n\nMaybe I should also mention that I usually go to these boardgames nights with another friend of mine and she was also there. So I was a bit stuck between ditching her or ditching my boyfriend. I felt quite stressed the whole night in general, first wondering what game my boyfriend could even join whenever he would reach, as the place was packed. And after they turned him away, I was stressed about doing the right thing by my boyfriend, my friend, the game I was already in the middle of and myself \ud83d\ude05", "He is not always late. He said he got stuck at work and he works quite far away. However, he was a whole 1 hour later than planned for. I am not mad at him for being late, it happens, I am just wondering how I I should've handled that situation.", "NTA. Dump him. He disrespected your plans by being late then guilts you for not dropping everything to be with him. That is a good reason to dump him. Go and look for someone who honors your time as much as their own.", "I think him being 90 minutes late to an event his gf was looking forward to is the larger issue.\n\nShe had every right to stay and enjoy it and didn\u2019t need to leave early or stress about the time. He didn\u2019t stress about the time when he decided to be 90 minutes late.", "He was 90 minutes late. That was disrespectful to you. Don\u2019t play the naive girl and blame yourself for enjoying an event you had been looking forward to."]}
