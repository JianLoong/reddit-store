Depression can be crippling. Her crying over a banana isn't something she wants to be doing, noone wants to feel that way. \n\nShe got some heartbreaking news, she's suffering, and it's great you're being a support to her when she needs it BUT it becomes an issue when you're then making your wife feel like her needing this extra support from you is a burden. \n \nLife is always throwing curveballs directly at our faces, it could be you next that needs her support.

She didn\u2019t see a baby in a stroller or an advertisement with a pregnant woman, it rained so she felt the need to call him to complain about it on a day he specifically told her he would be busy, which he says she has done before, and the one time he says no she just ignores him and gets mad?
