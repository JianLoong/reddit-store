You said she works at a nursery if I understood correctly, that makes it even harder.

Depression can be crippling. Her crying over a banana isn't something she wants to be doing, noone wants to feel that way. \n\nShe got some heartbreaking news, she's suffering, and it's great you're being a support to her when she needs it BUT it becomes an issue when you're then making your wife feel like her needing this extra support from you is a burden. \n \nLife is always throwing curveballs directly at our faces, it could be you next that needs her support.

Psychological help to process what's going on emotionally and help her rebuild a new positive image of herself and her future that doesn't involve having children.\n\nSo much of this is tied up with societal expectations of women, and I understand that it's difficult to put yourself in your wife's shoes because it's not something you have experienced. But as someone who had experienced it, all I can tell you is that the pervading feeling of misery is real.", "NTA. I saw a comment you made saying that she doesn't want therapy. There is only so much you can help and you can't risk your work in the long-term. You sound burned out and frustrated though. You need to fill your cup too so that you can sustain being there for her through a clearly difficult time for both of you. Remember, you don't have the have the right words every time. Sometimes just being held by someone you love while you fall apart is all you need.   \n\n\nIf she has female friends, I'd encourage her to do some sort of activities with them so that she has something positive to settle her but also the opportunity to let it all out and get her thoughts in order. You might be too close to the situation to be her only confidant.   \n\n\nI do wonder if her self-esteem has taken a knock and is pushing you away with this behaviour because she is under-valuing herself. Loose theory.   \n\n\nI have been in her shoes and felt terrible for putting a cloud over the house for a long time and my partner was amazing through it all. I didn't need solutions, I just needed patience and for him to be present with me and love me while I fall apart, which I know is no small thing over a long period.   \n\n\nThere are online therapy options these days if scheduling is a barrier. Maybe her hormones need to be checked also. I hope you both weather the storms and that she gets the help she needs when she's ready.", "NAH. But I think your wife needs a level of help you are not equipped to give her.

I think you're both at your wit's end in this situation and it's not going to get better with outside help.", "NTA", "Sounds like she's grieving about the infertility. She probably needs medical help for struggling to manage and adjust -- not dismissive judgments about being 'overly emotional'. It's understandable that you're frustrated and at a loss on what to do because these situations could put employment at risk for one or both of you and she's said no to therapy. That said, you gotta do your best to keep it constructive. Consider if there are trusted friends or family either of you can reach out to for emotional support and encouragement. Maybe set aside some time to address her concerns about therapy or seeing a doctor about whether this is a serotonin problem. Good luck.", "NTA.  Although it must be heartbreaking for your wife, what about you?  Her life isn't the only one that's affected here.  You're also coming to terms with not being able to have a child unless you try to adopt.  I would probably lose it, too, if my husband had been crying over every single thing the last two months.  You're out there doing what you've got to do.  She seems like she's really struggling.  If she refuses therapy, I'm not sure what else you can do.  Catering to every single that goes wrong that she can handle herself as an adult is not the answer.  It's so sad, but she has to find a way to keep going.  Her getting a license because you can't drop everything for her right before an important work meeting is a start.   If you had left work that day, your job probably, as time goes on, would be in jeopardy, and she'd depend too much on you for things she needs to do herself.  Someone needs to stay level-headed and responsible here, and that seems to be you.  Stay strong.  Although you love her and should remind her of that, you've got to both keep going.  Maybe if you offer to go therapy with her, she'd be into it.  Maybe she needs to get away for a few days.  Perhaps a girls' trip or something.  I'm not sure if any of them have been in the same situation.", "NTA\u2026 but obviously your wife has a LOT going on. Why wait until June to have driving lessons?

Typically , we are on a controlled spectrum of emotions. For some, this spectrum can be thrown very rapidly to one side or the other, whether it be a fit of rage or a deep state of depression, with seemingly no major reason outside of typical life obstacles. I would suggest seeking out a medical professional so your wife doesn't suffer more than she has to, and see if there is some deeper emotional regulation issue here. It can be difficult to be in a relationship with someone who struggles with their mental health, but often these people have the capacity to love so deeply and have incredibly beautiful hearts. Boundaries are super important in any relationship, and at times you cannot drop everything to run to the aid of someone, even if it's the person you love the most.

Say \"I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up. I really wish I could have given how you've been feeling lately, but my job's understandingness probably isn't infinite, and we need my income.\"\n2.

People would appreciate the gas money!\" (There used to be websites specifically for these kinds of arrangements.)\n3. Address the emotional issues. Say \"I'm worried about how frequently you seem to be hurting in the past couple of months. Could you tell me a little about what's happening?\" Then listen thoroughly.

Say \"I'm worried there could be a medical problem making you feel this way. I feel it's important for you to see your doctor and rule anything like that out since there are many medical issues that can cause frequent crying and could be causing more serious health issues we're not aware of.\"\n5. Say \"In addition to looking into medical help, I feel we also need to get to the root of what's making you so upset. I hate to see you hurting so much. I want to be as supportive as I possibly can, but everyone has their limits for how much support they can provide in emotional situations. I'm worried I'll burn out, and then neither of us will be well. I feel we should both see therapists to help us get through this. We could even go together to help us learn how to better cope with hard times as a team.
