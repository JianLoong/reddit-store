Depression can be crippling. Her crying over a banana isn't something she wants to be doing, noone wants to feel that way. \n\nShe got some heartbreaking news, she's suffering, and it's great you're being a support to her when she needs it BUT it becomes an issue when you're then making your wife feel like her needing this extra support from you is a burden. \n \nLife is always throwing curveballs directly at our faces, it could be you next that needs her support.

I\u2019m not even talking about the picking her up situation. He basically portrays her as a crybaby. I stand by my original comment he\u2019s emotionally incapable. Maybe he needs to grow up.", "Sounds like OP is just exhausted, frustrated and needed to vent. Regardless of how close someone is to you, if they\u2019re emotional the majority of the time and it\u2019s been going on for months, it can be emotionally taxing on anyone to handle; especially if they refuse help via therapy", "We aren\u2019t all programmed the same. Unfortunately a lot of us men offer solutions instead of understanding. This has taken me a long time to understand. Doesn\u2019t mean op is a asshole.", "She\u2019s crying over rain and he\u2019s the one who needs to grow up? I think you need to stop going on niceguys and see your own bias, they both cannot get pregnant and while yes it\u2019s harder on her you are completely ignoring the guy and just assuming he doesn\u2019t want to deal with her when he\u2019s clearly trying his hardest. She didn\u2019t see a baby in a stroller or an advertisement with a pregnant woman, it rained so she felt the need to call him to complain about it on a day he specifically told her he would be busy, which he says she has done before, and the one time he says no she just ignores him and gets mad? Yeah that\u2019s real emotional maturity. Idk what to tell you", "Yes it does. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to learn how to meet their partners needs. If you don\u2019t learn that you\u2019re an AH.", "No, SHE cannot get pregnant. I don\u2019t think you understand the emotional pain this can cause a woman who wants to become a mom and after a year of trying was informed she can\u2019t ever become a biological mom. She isn\u2019t crying about rain! It sounds like you may be just as emotionally stunted as him. I did say it\u2019s hard for him - yes, it must be tiring to try to console your wife for 2 months. It is also *only* two months. She needs time to work through it with someone who can emotionally support her. Not sure what your comment about niceguys has to do with anything unless you are one and somehow was triggered by me being on that sub.", "Doesn't mean you can completely ignore the other person in the relationship that you are relying so heavily upon to meet all of YOUR needs.\n\nHe is also a human with emotions who is getting no opportunity to understand or deal with them. He is constantly supporting someone who is not even willing to do anything to help themselves. Won't even consider therapy.\n\nSpeaking from a similar (not same) position his wife is in now (a while ago) the longer one victimizes oneself the longer you prolong the recovery. I learnt this in my own therapy. Brutal to hear, I was so upset! But, my Dr was right. I was feeling so sorry for myself and giving no understanding of the equal pain my partner was in.\n\nMen's emotions matter too!", "So you\u2019re saying it\u2019s a mutual obligation?", "They are a couple, they wanted a child, they cannot get pregnant. Do you think he just goes \u201coh well, no baby for now\u201d. He is also going through the pain of not becoming a father which you continually ignore. And once again because she didn\u2019t get her way, once, she ignores and doesn\u2019t speak to him. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nA relationship is a two way street, and she needs to work with him as well. Idk if you\u2019re actually on that sub, but you clearly have some disdain for this dude. I\u2019m not denying that she\u2019s absolutely shattered, but you\u2019re acting as if her husband is just annoyed at her and doesn\u2019t care about their children they cannot conceive. He isn\u2019t King Henry VIII, ready to off her head for the inconvenience  of her being infertile for a suitable heir or some garbage.", "Dude I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s acting rationally or healthy, nor do I have any disdain for this guy, why would I have any type of feeling towards a random person on the internet? I\u2019m just trying to explain that he doesn\u2019t have any emotional capacity for her and I don\u2019t think any of your comments argues otherwise."]}
