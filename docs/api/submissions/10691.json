It's heartbreaking, devastating to find out you can't do the one thing that is meant to come to you naturally as a woman.\n\nIt has taken me years of hard emotional work to get to a place where I'm ok with it. This is now the focus of my academic work because that's the way I've found works best to bring me healing.\n\nYou need to understand your wife is not being overly emotional. If it is the infertility that is the issue here you need to get her to get help. Psychological help to process what's going on emotionally and help her rebuild a new positive image of herself and her future that doesn't involve having children.\n\nSo much of this is tied up with societal expectations of women, and I understand that it's difficult to put yourself in your wife's shoes because it's not something you have experienced. But as someone who had experienced it, all I can tell you is that the pervading feeling of misery is real.", "NTA. I saw a comment you made saying that she doesn't want therapy. There is only so much you can help and you can't risk your work in the long-term. You sound burned out and frustrated though. You need to fill your cup too so that you can sustain being there for her through a clearly difficult time for both of you. Remember, you don't have the have the right words every time. Sometimes just being held by someone you love while you fall apart is all you need.   \n\n\nIf she has female friends, I'd encourage her to do some sort of activities with them so that she has something positive to settle her but also the opportunity to let it all out and get her thoughts in order. You might be too close to the situation to be her only confidant.   \n\n\nI do wonder if her self-esteem has taken a knock and is pushing you away with this behaviour because she is under-valuing herself. Loose theory.   \n\n\nI have been in her shoes and felt terrible for putting a cloud over the house for a long time and my partner was amazing through it all. I didn't need solutions, I just needed patience and for him to be present with me and love me while I fall apart, which I know is no small thing over a long period.   \n\n\nThere are online therapy options these days if scheduling is a barrier.

I think you're both at your wit's end in this situation and it's not going to get better with outside help.", "NTA", "Sounds like she's grieving about the infertility. She probably needs medical help for struggling to manage and adjust -- not dismissive judgments about being 'overly emotional'. It's understandable that you're frustrated and at a loss on what to do because these situations could put employment at risk for one or both of you and she's said no to therapy. That said, you gotta do your best to keep it constructive. Consider if there are trusted friends or family either of you can reach out to for emotional support and encouragement. Maybe set aside some time to address her concerns about therapy or seeing a doctor about whether this is a serotonin problem. Good luck.", "NTA.  Although it must be heartbreaking for your wife, what about you?  Her life isn't the only one that's affected here.

You're out there doing what you've got to do.  She seems like she's really struggling.  If she refuses therapy, I'm not sure what else you can do.  Catering to every single that goes wrong that she can handle herself as an adult is not the answer.  It's so sad, but she has to find a way to keep going.  Her getting a license because you can't drop everything for her right before an important work meeting is a start.   If you had left work that day, your job probably, as time goes on, would be in jeopardy, and she'd depend too much on you for things she needs to do herself.  Someone needs to stay level-headed and responsible here, and that seems to be you.  Stay strong.  Although you love her and should remind her of that, you've got to both keep going.

I would suggest seeking out a medical professional so your wife doesn't suffer more than she has to, and see if there is some deeper emotional regulation issue here. It can be difficult to be in a relationship with someone who struggles with their mental health, but often these people have the capacity to love so deeply and have incredibly beautiful hearts.

It's hard on both of them, and he's been emotionally supporting her but it doesn't sound like anyone is checking in on him too.

It wanes even further when they refuse help but demand that others drop what they're doing to comfort them whenever they need it. I deal with several severe mental illnesses, but the operative word here is \"I\". **I** deal with it, I take my meds I go to therapy and every single day I'm working on processing this shit and learning/reinforcing coping skills. It isn't easy, like at all in the least bit, but it needs to be done. For me most of all, because frankly the idea of relying on others for my mental well-being is terrifying as the only person guaranteed to be around and available to help me is....me. People need to be as responsible for their own health, mental/emotional included, as they can be. Outside support like this should be a short term crutch until healthier coping methods are established, because codependency is not healthy and *will not help*.", "So she's been spending six hours a day commuting on public transport when you could spend an hour to drive her there? How in hell did that become the routine for you guys instead of carpooling? Her commute alone is almost a full time job.", "I wonder how long her commute would be if she drove herself and didn't use public transportation. Where I live in the US, I could drive to a major city 1.5 hours away but if I did public transportation, it's 20 mins drive to bus stop, 30 min bus ride and then a 3 hr train ride. (If I took a bus to the bus stop, that's a 15 min walk and likely half an hour of buses.)\n\nA 3 OR 5 hour car ride is easily 12-24 hours for other locations, after driving an hour to the train station.", "Can you get yourself solo therapy? I know it\u2019s expensive, but it sounds like you\u2019re stressed and grieving, which means you can\u2019t also fully be there for your wife\u2019s stress and grieving. You two are really young to be dealing with such huge emotional burdens, and at least one of you reaching out to a professional might help you both.", "She doesnt need therapy. She needs to see a medical doctor to check if she has depression.

Big difference.\n\nOp, YTA. Part of being a good spouse is supporting your partner through the bad. It's been what? Two months since she found out she was infertile? It takes time to process that blow. \n\nYou say she's refused therapy, well, it's ultimatum time. You can even offer to go with her for the first session. Therapy is scary.

He spent the entire post talking about how she cries over everything and mocks her for not crying at one point.", "This message is directed at OP. If his reaction to this terrible situation is to go on the internet to see if he is an asshole, he needs to see a therapist. This sub is for figuring out if some minor incident makes you an asshole, not for dealing with depression in a relationship. There are plenty of resources for help, what won't help is figuring out if a bunch of strangers think he is an asshole.

She'd rather him drop everything and miss work to come get her. \n\nYou can't help someone who refuses to accept the help, or refuses to help themselves.

I'm all for having compassion for your partner, but that is too much. \n\nSometimes life sucks, but you don't get to just demand people drop everything to cater to your emotions, especially not every damn day.

I'm guessing they found out about her being sterile when trying to have a baby, so I would believe it has been a hard blow to be dealt. It takes time and lots of work to get over something like this.
