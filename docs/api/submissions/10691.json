She cries, no sugar? She cries, missed her bus? She cries.\n\nI\u2019d almost think she was pregnant, but we discovered after a year of trying to conceive that she\u2019s infertile (this was two months ago) she also recently had a baby start at her nursery, which also sets her off (so it\u2019s been a tough time)\n\nI\u2019ve tried to be empathetic, but it\u2019s all the time tears! I\u2019m so tired. Like each time she cries I\u2019ll drop what I\u2019m doing to comfort her, even if she calls me at work.\n\nShe walks an hour to work, after a bus journey (she leaves at 630 to get to work at 930 that\u2019s how long the travel is) I told her I\u2019d drive her, she didn\u2019t want me to, I told her to take a umbrella and she  forgot.\n\nShe called me, sobbing, because it rained like I said it would, she asked me to pick her up and I said I couldn\u2019t because I had a meeting - she said \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand\u201d and truthfully, they have been understanding\u2026but it\u2019s all the time, and I did warn her.\n\nI refused, she did get huffy and when she got home that night she wasn\u2019t crying (shocker) but was mad, and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since but we haven\u2019t seen each other much as she gets home late and still has work to do (coursework etc)\n\nI asked a friend who insisted I\u2019m TA.\n\nBut my wife texted me to say she\u2019s considering taking driving lessons in June, which I thought was a win! But she\u2019s apparently still angry.\n\nExcuse my grammar I\u2019m typing this hurriedly before work in the ice cold so my hands are numb!!\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit; I can\u2019t read all the comments/reply to them, but thanks for the input! For those asking \n\n1) I did want children, but obviously I want to allow my wife to have her feelings on this I do not want to grieve in front of her and think I\u2019m blaming her - should she want to adopt or do IVF, I am open but should she decide to not have children then I will support her. I do not feel like it is my space to be upset here.\n\n2) she got a hormonal blood test, for reasons other than trying to conceive  and  we were told due to a hormonal imbalance she would not conceive - at least not naturally, and even through intervention she will struggle.\n\n3) if she drove the journey would be 32 minutes, she\u2019s getting her qualification so moving jobs is out of the question, not that she\u2019d want to, so she\u2019s looking into driving lessons", "created_utc": 1677140936, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119sn4m/aita_for_having_no_empathy_toward_my_overly/", "score": 3497, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously my case was different because I was told this before children were even remotely on my mind. But this is a tough thing to come to terms with. You said she works at a nursery if I understood correctly, that makes it even harder. She is grieving a life she wanted, a child she\u2019ll never have and as being able to grow a fetus and birth a child is often so intertwined with the identity as a woman, that\u2019s also something she has to figure out. This shit runs so deep, of course she is emotional!\n\nEdit: I obviously don\u2019t know your wife, but judging from my personal experience, chances are she\u2019s also worried you might leave her because she can\u2019t give you children.

Maybe it\u2019s easy for you but she\u2019s clearly grieving. You need to support and encourage her, instead of getting upset about it. If leaving to help her would affect your job, then order her an Uber. Show some compassion and maybe Help her find a job that isn\u2019t a 2 hour commute, that\u2019s insane", "Your wife is in trouble and would benefit from professional help.

Depression can be crippling. Her crying over a banana isn't something she wants to be doing, noone wants to feel that way. \n\nShe got some heartbreaking news, she's suffering, and it's great you're being a support to her when she needs it BUT it becomes an issue when you're then making your wife feel like her needing this extra support from you is a burden. \n \nLife is always throwing curveballs directly at our faces, it could be you next that needs her support. Would she be there for you if roles were reversed? Would she make you feel guilty about it?\n\nI don't know man, I just think if you love someone you want to help ease their suffering don't you? \n\nI hope she is able to see a doctor (not sure what country  you're in and how possible that is) or someone that can help her out a bit.

She just learned she's infertile, for someone who wanted to experience pregnancy and parenthood that is a deeply hurtful revelation, traumatic even. She needs therapy and support as she goes through the grieving process and the way you wrote your post you come off as extremely dismissive of the fact she is clearly struggling.

Catering to every single that goes wrong that she can handle herself as an adult is not the answer.  It's so sad, but she has to find a way to keep going.  Her getting a license because you can't drop everything for her right before an important work meeting is a start.   If you had left work that day, your job probably, as time goes on, would be in jeopardy, and she'd depend too much on you for things she needs to do herself.  Someone needs to stay level-headed and responsible here, and that seems to be you.  Stay strong.  Although you love her and should remind her of that, you've got to both keep going.

I would suggest seeking out a medical professional so your wife doesn't suffer more than she has to, and see if there is some deeper emotional regulation issue here. It can be difficult to be in a relationship with someone who struggles with their mental health, but often these people have the capacity to love so deeply and have incredibly beautiful hearts.

Say \"I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up. I really wish I could have given how you've been feeling lately, but my job's understandingness probably isn't infinite, and we need my income.\"\n2.

People would appreciate the gas money!\" (There used to be websites specifically for these kinds of arrangements.)\n3. Address the emotional issues. Say \"I'm worried about how frequently you seem to be hurting in the past couple of months. Could you tell me a little about what's happening?\" Then listen thoroughly.

Say \"I'm worried there could be a medical problem making you feel this way. I feel it's important for you to see your doctor and rule anything like that out since there are many medical issues that can cause frequent crying and could be causing more serious health issues we're not aware of.\"\n5. Say \"In addition to looking into medical help, I feel we also need to get to the root of what's making you so upset. I hate to see you hurting so much. I want to be as supportive as I possibly can, but everyone has their limits for how much support they can provide in emotional situations. I'm worried I'll burn out, and then neither of us will be well. I feel we should both see therapists to help us get through this.

Getting donor sperm is relatively simple and cheap because the process of donating it is so easy. Donating eggs is extremely complicated and thus donor eggs are extremely expensive.

The price and the complexity shoot through the roof, well beyond what most people can handle. \n\nThose two things combine to create a looming threat that your partner will leave.
