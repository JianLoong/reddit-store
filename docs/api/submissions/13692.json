It\u2019s amazing to me how much hate, perceptions and judgements people make on a widow. I never would have imagined this is how it would be when my husband passed away. There is this power control of who is the most important to him even when his wishes were already made. I\u2019ve heard \u201cbut his mother, brother and sister were there first, don\u2019t think you deserve anything just because you were his wife\u201d. Never once putting into consideration I am still raising his four children. It\u2019s like his death has cut his connection to his children that he adored so so much.

It SHOULD go to you and the children. Glad you said no. My father hadn't completed changing his life insurance, and after his murder my grandma sued my mom for the money. They ended up splitting it and I never met his family (even though most were pissed at her for doing that) until I was 25.
