That would be the first route. The neighbors should have kept them in the loop, letting them know how long this was going to be.

Take this out. \n\nAnd you expect that to go well?", "A little communication goes a long way. Why cause issues if you can just walk there and say, hey, this isn\u2019t working, is there another way to do this? Why go strait to reporting them if there was never an issue with them before? These are people they will be living next to for quite some time. If they say tough, it is what it is, then sure, go report them, but at least give them the decency to go talk to them face to face. What if this is just temporary? Now you\u2019ve made your neighbor all angry over something that could have just been talked over and help remedy the situation. Now you\u2019ve made an enemy for no reason. You think for one second that it\u2019s not going to get out that you went to the township and reported them?"]}
