It's your birthday, you get to pick the cake.", "If your cake isn't chocolate, you could just tell her chocolate gives you a headache. I def get a headache when I eat chocolate.", "NTA - you told her you wanted to provide your own cake, you told her not to bake the cake you don't like, for your birthday. If she gets upset, it's because of her own doing. Take the cake, and have a slice for me!", "Would you feel worse if you hurt your grandma's feeling or didn't eat the cake you want? \n\nWhich ever way you answer should guide your decision.", "NTA It\u2019s your birthday. You enjoy what you want. She sounds an awful lot like my wife\u2019s grandmother. It\u2019s not always about her: and it\u2019s your day. Hope your cake is great.", "NTA - she already knows you don\u2019t like the cake and made it anyways for your birthday. She takes too much pride in being in control of that party. I\u2019m with your dad. Hope your day goes well! \n\nJust curious, is it your dad\u2019s mom? If this Grandma is on your dad\u2019s side, I\u2019m sure he knows his mom well enough to make a good call.", "YWBTA I don't like cake either but it's something I eat as a polite social obligation. Your grandmother made this cake for you out of love and kindness so you wouldn't  have to bring your own.", "NTA, it's your birthday but do try to talk to her about it.", "This might be my own thing, but I don't love when everyone piggybacks on a celebration and choose to kill 2 birds with one stone and make it also a family reunion. If you wanted that that's you business but it should still be about you and what you want on your birthday. NTA", "NTA.  It's your birthday.  Bring the cake that you want and already told her that you  were bringing.  Also, more cake is never a bad thing.  Happy Birthday!!!!", "YWNBTA but if it were me I'd just save the cake and eat it with your family when you get home, it wouldn't be worth the drama that i know your grandmother will stir up over you bringing your own. But you'd be well within your rights since you told her beforehand that you'd be bringing your own cake and have already bought it. NTA", "NTA If anyone is the asshole here, it's your grandmother for not making a cake you like and then trying to insist you don't bring a cake for yourself to enjoy. Listen to your Dad, it's YOUR birthday celebration, you're not even inconveniencing your grandmother in any way. She's being entirely unreasonable and inconsiderate.\n\nHonestly, it just sounds like she wants to throw a get-together and have everything the way she wants it. Saying it was for your birthday seems like an after thought.", "NTA - where I\u2019m from baking someone a cake they said they don\u2019t like is a hostile act - bring a cake you like, and if she gives you grief ask the guests to vote on whether you were doing something ungrateful", "NTA\n\nWhy don't you bake the cake and cut it at home with your immediate family? Grandma doesn't get her feelings hurt and you get the birthday cake you actually want.\n\nEdit: Read that it would go to waste. That being the case, just bring the cake. I know she's old, and there is this tradition that apparently the birthday person's wishes are irrelevant, but maybe that should change. It's a cake. If she's hurt, she needs to grow up and develop some coping mechanisms. Not all things can/should be her way.", "NTA \n\n\"Thank you, granny, but I wanted a specific cake and I'm bringing it. More cake is never a bad thing.\"", "it does actually- i do have migraines in my medical history, she does know that! i can try that angle", ">it's actually a tradition, everyone in the family gets a birthday family reunion so it's not unexpected! I just usually never get to pick either the main meal or dessert and let it go so i know my grandma will think im being ungrateful if i push back now", ">worth \n\ni live only with my dad so the cake would def go to waste cuz i eat little bits and slowly hahaha we don't talk to the neighbors so idk if giving some away would be weird", "Ok, that makes sense. It's still you birthday and if you want to bring your own cake, I don't see a problem with that. Odds are both cakes will still be eaten so it might actually make it so ppl can have more cake.", "It's your birthday. If you're grandma makes it about herself then she's ruining your birthday.\n\nNTA.\n\nIf she creates drama, I'd suggest leaving with your parents and have a nice dinner at a restaurant you want to go to. Preferably with a dessert menu that appeals to you.", "Ah okay. Good of you to not want food to go to waste, if it were me and my dad we'd eat a whole cake in no time :)  Let us know what you decide to do and how it goes over with your grandma"]}
