You could have been considerate and brought him some takeout from wherever you had lunch, since you were so proud of his level of responsibility.

If yes, he can come get me or I'll go meet him. Your son doesn't have that luxury of being able to come meet you.\n\nI'd be hurt if my husband didn't even text, because I'd be waiting for him to come home to eat because that's what he normally does. And I'm an adult. Kids assume you're gonna feed them, as they should. If you'd said, \"we're going to go out to eat after, are you ok to feed yourself?\" That would have been fine because it would have been communicated and he'd have the understanding that his choice was skipping both things.\n\nSo yeah, your son *can* feed himself, but I can see why he'd be hurt over your choice. It would have been better to pick up food and bring it home rather than just specifically leave him out.", "You know what\u2019s a sign of actual good parenting?

Apologise to him and figure out an alternative to make it up to him.

Like, he was only denied a meal out, it\u2019s not like he was denied food in general or an invite to the family event that led to the lunch. \n\nMy only thinking is that, sure, you could\u2019ve brought him takeout. Going home just to get him sounds like an unreasonable expectation unless the house is within like a 5 minute drive. Bringing him something would maybe have been a nice treat since he was being responsible, but it\u2019s not like it was needed. No one needs takeout if they have food at home.

Miss church and miss out on food. Last time I checked, that's the opposite of the lessons I was taught in church.", "You deserve it, you were definitely ruder.", "... Read the whole thing?", "I don't know about you but at 15 I didn't exactly think that eating in a restaurant with my family was particularly thrilling.  The novelty of eating food that was otherwise unavailable was the appeal.  Being able to eat it at home by myself would have just been even better.", "Very few people are saying OP should have gone home and picked his kid up. Everyone's point is there was an option between excluding him from lunch completely and going home to pick him up and that option was bringing him a meal home so he didn't miss out on the restaurant food that everyone got just because he was being responsible and studying. You can eat and study at the same time.", "He could have texted them and asked for food? WHAT? Did you even read the post, he didn't know they were going out to eat.\n\nI feel like you keep missing the entire point of everything people are saying in this post.", "They didn't tell him they were going out for lunch so he didn't know to ask for them to bring him something home.", "No one says the kid is going to starve. Obviously that\u2019s not the concern here.\n\nThe concern is that the kid is going to feel left out. And that actually happened. If you\u2019re trying to reason your way into thinking that the kid isn\u2019t going to feel left out, you\u2019re making a futile point because it already turned out that way. \n\nOP shouldn\u2019t asked the kid if they wanted anything. That\u2019s the nice and considerate thing to do.", "Just out of curiosity.. had one of the parents stayed home and the others went out to lunch without that parent, would it be a big deal? Does that mean they excluded the other parent? No, sometimes things happen in the moment and whomever is there goes and those that aren't just don't get to participate.  That is life.", "But he was at home..... Alone.... With no food whilst the \"real\" \"religious\" family ate...... Right?", "Heaven forbid you do a little more driving to have an outing with all of your kids", "Could you not have offered to order him something to go? You didn\u2019t need to pick hi up.", "Makes sense, I'm guessing they had all Saturday to do homework or at least some time, and it's not like church is an all day thing just sounds like the kid didn't want to go to church and that's okay but don't expect to be rewarded for not going. So on your side of NTA", "That's how it's looking to me, a bit before 15 was when I started getting fed up and thinking for myself and I know I tried to get out of church but I would miss out if they did something after. It sucks but also I wouldn't expect to get the bribe if I didn't go to get bribed lol", "Lol don't blame anti religion lol, if anyone hates Muslims it's Christians, lol. The far Christian right despises Muslims lol. You are extremely passive aggressive, how do you live to be 43 and not have the mentality to consider and empathize with your son. Stop with the it's cold and will be soggy, you are really just projecting your immaturity. Just accept that you are the asshole. If you were proud of your son making a responsible decision then you want to encourage those decision making skills not attack him from such a passive aggressive stance. Accept that you are a truly asshole.", "Or OP could have texted their studious son and let him know they were eating out at \"blank\" restaurant.  Then offer to bring food home, he could've ordered something cold like a salad or sandwich that holds up well when cold.  \n\nOP is more interested in being right than acknowledging he's giving his children very mixed messages about education vs. church prioritization.  Congratulations you taught your son an important life lesson.", "Because we were already in town and no one had plans.", "Do you really expect me to believe you see no difference between a single hour long drive home and a drive that would be one hour home, an hour back to town and an hour back home again?", "Microwave is against their religion", "We drive an hour to get to town, which is where the church is.\n\nIf you know you're going to have to microwave it, why not just buy a microwave meal for half the price? That seems illogical to me.", "It's an hour. I never said it was thirty minutes.", "Yeah, we use it to heat up certain things. But not entire meals. Then it's rubbery or soggy. Gross.", "By saying cold takeout sounds horrible?", "So again, it is not about being hungry, it is about being stuck at home studying and missing out on the fun of the restaurant.  It is FOMO.  Plain and simple.", "If they didn't offer to bring something home to their spouse after they took the kids out, yes they would be an asshole then as well.", "Where did you get the no food part from?", "Well, us not picking him up is what he was upset about, so that's overall irrelevant.", "But if they were being passive aggressive about it, that's an AH way of dealing with it.  They claim they weren't punishing the kid for not going, but I suspect they really were. In which case be straight about it and tell the kid that if they want to be included in whatever family outings may take place on Sunday after church, they should get their homework done on Saturday and make time for church and lunch.  Not pretend this was totally coincidental.", "No, this is totally fair. If you don't go on the outing with the rest of the family, you don't get to complain about missing part of it. Your son is 15, totally capable of grabbing food from your kitchen. \n\nNTA", "I never said that , you take 2 hours everyday anyways . To church then back home , you don\u2019t have to do multiple trips . A simple text of \u201c hey we\u2019re getting lunch , would you like anything ? \u201c \n\n\n\n\nAnd then you argue \u201c the food would\u2019ve been cold \u201c you have an oven and a microwave , you could easily have heated up the food . You just didn\u2019t want to get him food , you can say that\u2019s not the case all you want but we all see it", "Because microwave meals aren't the same as restaurant meals.  And because you can reheat your takeout in whatever way makes sense for the type of food (doesn't have to be microwave).  You could have brought your 15yo something on the condition that he would be responsible for reheating as he saw fit.  (If he doesn't know how, he could google it.)  Don't you ever bring home leftovers from a restaurant.  I virtually never finish everything served to me in a restaurant because they give insane serving sizes.", "Your entire argument for takeout is illogical.", "Imaging driving 2 hours in one day just to go to church", "Just accept you were punishing your teen for not going to church.", "Oh, so you don't know how to use appliances? Got it.", "What do you do with your leftovers from the restaurant? People bring those home and heat them up the next day all the time. It's not rubbery and soggy if you heat them correctly and if it's something that's better heated up in the oven, you can do that as well. You may think it's gross but your son is hurt that you didn't include him and this would have been an easy way to do so.", "How old are you?", "You can choose to order a meal that heats up well in the microwave or on a pan. \n\nThe point is, you never have your responsible child the OPTION. \n\nYou should have called and asked if they wanted you to bring them something. \n\nYTA", "But you\u2019re not the one who would be eating the \u201ccold take out\u201d so it\u2019s not for you to decide whether someone else would want it without AT LEAST ASKING. YTA big time here. Playing favorites with your kids and dismissing your eldest\u2019s feelings.", "Yes - you're saying \"well at that point just reheat something from the fridge or freezer\", that's not the point. It's not the point of what you want or what you think sounds good, but what your kid wants too. What if he doesn't mind or doesn't care that it's cold? Even if it is, it's the gesture of it. Plus, wouldn't you want to reward your kid for trying to better themself academically? I know plenty of kids that wouldn't have actually done their studies if presented the opportunity yours was given. \n\n\nI feel like you're either trolling or asking for attention at this point. You were given a pretty clear verdict, and are still rationalizing it. YTA.", "There was a year, pretty recently, when this was the only option if you wanted a meal from a restaurant.  You've never had a pizza delivered?", "Yawn you are just making excuses because you were a selfish dick punishing your son for not going to church", "Sorry I meant alone whilst the \"Family had lunch\".....\n\n\nHe wasn't part of the lunch you had.....", "It\u2019s really not. That could\u2019ve been a middle ground. He may not have been upset if that compromise was presented m. You seem to be very black and white in your thought process", "The kid stayed home to do homework. They didn\u2019t want to stay back. OP is definitely TA", "I'm not arguing for takeout. I never get takeout. Seems pointless. Like, the whole point of a restaurant is to eat there. If you're going to eat at home, why spend all the money on restaurant food?", "Why is that worse than the two hours of driving we need to go to work and school? Not to mention the grocery store, movie theater, skate rink, etc...", "Nothing. We eat all of our food and if we don't finish something, we leave it. But we only don't finish stuff if it's bad.", "43", "Says the person who wastes gas to go to church. Just read your bible.", "The whole rest of the world disagrees with you.  You can heat up takeout in the microwave or toaster oven or regular oven.   Plenty of food tastes just as good heated up, and there's usually way more options at ax restaurant than at home. You're being deliberately dense.", "All your ridiculous attempts at excusing and justifying what you did, and your flat out refusal to even acknowledge any sort of compromise, makes you that much more of an asshole. Not that you care.", "So you get something you like that you don\u2019t have to cook and can eat in the comfort of your own home", "Okay, then you really live in knowone's land... i can't imagine how much you must pay for gas each month... and how much more time you would have if you lived somewhere else", "Wait so you have never brought leftovers or takeout home ever? Like you eat half a pizza and leave it? Or a sandwich? You are just making stuff up now.", "##YTA", "Bahaha \ud83e\udd23best answer ever\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23", "I also waste gas to go to work and take my kids to school.
