We grew apart a little in our teens when her best friend became her bigger focus. Her best friend was not very nice to me ever. I hated her being around because she always seemed to dislike me and more than once she made comments toward me that left me upset. But my whole family loved her. She didn't have a good relationship with her parents and she was an only child. From the age of 15 she spent most of her time at our house which often meant I felt out of place. My parents would tell me we'd get closer with time and she was just struggling with having a younger kid around so much. When she turned 18 my parents adopted her so she'd have family legally to fall back on who would be there for her and since then she has been treated the very same as me and my sister. My sister loves it. But things between me and her were not improved by the adoption.\n\nMy sister and I ended up a little closer again but not like it was before and not like she has with her best friend. And I get that. Friends can often be the family you choose vs the family you are biologically related to. But it makes it hard for me to do the big family stuff because technically she is now family and I would need to invite her and not inviting her would be a huge freaking deal.\n\nI'm engaged to my amazing fiance and I have found a really good sisterly relationship with his older sister. She's the only girl in their family and I think she loved the idea of having that sisterly relationship. So when we got engaged I asked her to be my bridesmaid. My only bridesmaid. \n\nMy sister had asked about bridesmaids and said she would love to be mine. I asked her if she really wanted to be. She said of course. That she and her best friend would be the best bridesmaids. I asked her if she'd do it if her best friend wasn't asked. She told me that wouldn't happen since we're all family now and she's our sister now. I told her she wasn't my sister or my friend and I wouldn't want her in my wedding. This is when my parents got involved too and they asked me why I didn't ask my sister. I said I love my sister, even if we're not close like we were, but I would not want her best friend to be a bridesmaid too and I know they would never be okay with me having just my sister. I think everyone knows what happened from here, seeing as I'm posting. I was reminded she's family. That she's legally my sister now. That it seems so mean to not ask my sister just because I would have to include \"both sisters\" and how I am harming the relationship more than anyone else by doing this.

However, by taking in and adopting someone who so clearly doesn\u2019t like me you\u2019ve done exactly what her parents did but to me. I feel isolated from my own family because I don\u2019t consider someone who isn\u2019t kind to me to be a sister.

Your parent's made the choice to adopt her and make her a daughter. You were an adult at the time and you did not have any say. They don't get to dictate who you love like family and who you don't. You had no choice in her becomming their daughter, but that doesn't make her your sister.", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t believe your family did that. If the best friend was over so much they must have been aware of the bad blood between you guys. You don\u2019t just adopt an adult without consulting your minor daughter.\n\nIdk how you usually deal with family members hurting you but it sounds like you have difficulty advocating for yourself. Talk with your husband. He should have an opinion that puts you first for a change and he should have observed the family dynamics. \n\nIt feels like your parents loved the best friend so much, they didn\u2019t care what you would feel. I would go low contact with all of them but I don\u2019t stand for stuff like this at all.", "NTA you aren't obligated to put your sister in your wedding party under any circumstances and certainly not required to include the person who made you feel like the adopted child. \n\nYour parents cannot mandate friendship.

Your wedding, your decision. Your sister and parents shouldn\u2019t force this.", "INFO: Did your sister's best friend ever apologize for her behavior? Are your parents aware of how she treated you?", "NTA", "NTA Etiquette wise parents and grandparents are not meant to play favourites, but siblings and aunts and uncles and cousins can. You are an adult you can have a relationship with one sister and not the other. That is your choice. It is rubbish that the two have to be invited to absolutely everything together as if they were one person. Your parents are wrong to be selling you this narrative. It was their choice to adopt her as their daughter, but not yours to accept her as either a friend or a sister. You can cut both sisters and have none if you so choose. Your sister chose a new sister and so can you. I had a terrible childhood filled with lies, broken promises, drama, gaslighting and abuse. I refused to have any of it in my life as an adult. You can choose to put your foot down if you are brave enough and refuse to put up with it. Life is too short for letting toxic people dictate your life.", "NTA- it's your wedding so it's your choice and why would you want someone who made you miserable in your home to be apart of it.

I kinda get that your parents adopted her so she wouldn't feel abandoned, but it's sad that they did so at your expense. The opinion that since you've always had them, you're always important to them, but they're showing that's not quite the case here.", "NTA\n\nI'd tell them, \"You adopted her, I didn't, therefore she's your family not mine.

I have no sisters and it's great.", "NTA\nThat is a difficult situation. :( I would invite her for harmony's sake (It's like bringing a +1) but I woudn't chose her as bridesmaid. Maybe you can talk to your adopted sister, how she feels about all of this.", "**NTA**   You need to have a sit down talk with your parents, and only your parents.   Tell them that it's long past time they accepted the fact that their fantasy of your being close to someone who actively denigrated you when they weren't around is never going to happen.   They chose to adopt the girl without ever considering how you felt.   Tell them that if you had gone to family counseling before, they would not be at all surprised to hear that you never wanted to this and that the family is now broken because they never cared to understand how you felt.", "NTA.

You don't and haven't had a good relationship with the best friend, your sister made it clear she would only be your bridesmaid on the condition her best friend was as well and your parents backed her and not you. I think they're not respecting your boundaries, feelings about your wedding day is plenty of harm. You are low man on the totem pole.

The f...k they talking about ???", ">My sister and I ended up a little closer again but not like it was before and not like she has with her best friend. And I get that. Friends can often be the family you choose vs the family you are biologically related to. \n\nThis is just as true for you as it is for them. You don't have to be close to your sisters friend just because your biological family chose her. \n\nNTA. Enjoy your wedding with the people you chose.", "Your parents are TAs for not taking your feelings into account when they made the decision to permanently alter your family. YOU didn't adopt your sister's best friend. Your sister is also TA for putting conditions about her best friend on your relationship with her. \n\nNTA, hold your ground on this and on the relationship in general. Draw boundaries, and keep them - your parents will keep pressing you to ignore your feelings in order to make their lives easier.

I would say that it's not about not having a sibling relationship, but how it's been clear for years she never really liked you or wanted to be near you.

Perhaps a better wording- im only having one bridesmaid.we are keeping the party small.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou have two families: the one \"imposed\" upon yourself (siblings, parents, relatives, etc.) that just happened to be there because of life; the family you choose to consider family.  \nAs you described it, your sister's best friend is imposed family, not chosen family. So, while she's legally your sister now, you still are totally entitle to not see her as your sister.

It is not right for your family to ignore that and only look at said sister\u2019s point of view!!!
