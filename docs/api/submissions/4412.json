We grew apart a little in our teens when her best friend became her bigger focus. Her best friend was not very nice to me ever. I hated her being around because she always seemed to dislike me and more than once she made comments toward me that left me upset. But my whole family loved her. She didn't have a good relationship with her parents and she was an only child. From the age of 15 she spent most of her time at our house which often meant I felt out of place. My parents would tell me we'd get closer with time and she was just struggling with having a younger kid around so much. When she turned 18 my parents adopted her so she'd have family legally to fall back on who would be there for her and since then she has been treated the very same as me and my sister. My sister loves it. But things between me and her were not improved by the adoption.\n\nMy sister and I ended up a little closer again but not like it was before and not like she has with her best friend. And I get that. Friends can often be the family you choose vs the family you are biologically related to. But it makes it hard for me to do the big family stuff because technically she is now family and I would need to invite her and not inviting her would be a huge freaking deal.\n\nI'm engaged to my amazing fiance and I have found a really good sisterly relationship with his older sister. She's the only girl in their family and I think she loved the idea of having that sisterly relationship. So when we got engaged I asked her to be my bridesmaid. My only bridesmaid. \n\nMy sister had asked about bridesmaids and said she would love to be mine. I asked her if she really wanted to be. She said of course. That she and her best friend would be the best bridesmaids. I asked her if she'd do it if her best friend wasn't asked. She told me that wouldn't happen since we're all family now and she's our sister now. I told her she wasn't my sister or my friend and I wouldn't want her in my wedding. This is when my parents got involved too and they asked me why I didn't ask my sister. I said I love my sister, even if we're not close like we were, but I would not want her best friend to be a bridesmaid too and I know they would never be okay with me having just my sister. I think everyone knows what happened from here, seeing as I'm posting. I was reminded she's family. That she's legally my sister now. That it seems so mean to not ask my sister just because I would have to include \"both sisters\" and how I am harming the relationship more than anyone else by doing this.

It\u2019s YOUR wedding, your big day with your husband to be. You get to choose who is in your wedding and standing by your side on your big day.", "\nNTA. Your sister has the right to say no, but she has no right to force a relation you don't want. /", "Sounds like OP's losing two bad sisters, but gaining a great one.", "They differently have a double standard with you and the friend.", "Yeah, you can just tell them you are sad they chose to abandon you completely in order to be her parents and this is why your sister will not be a bridesmaid and, the more you think about it, they will not play parental roles in your wedding.", "They want to keep proving to everyone how good and noble they are.", "Please tell me you are not having your father walk you down the aisle or giving your parents any special place in your wedding. The way your family acted, they should be guests at your wedding, nothing more. Why does your asshole sister and her asshole friend even want to be bridesmaids?", "It does make a legal difference if she's in a coma, and a probably a few other things I could think of if I bothered.\n\nThere's no legal requirement for her to be in the bridal party though, if that's what you meant I agree.\n\nDoesn't change the situation.", "They wouldn\u2019t have had to adopt her to have the legal right to make decisions for her if she was incapacitated. A power of attorney would cover that if the adult being adopted didn\u2019t want their bio family involved in their affairs if something happened. I can\u2019t think of anything that adopting an adult would do that a power of attorney or other legal document couldn\u2019t cover other then feel good reasons. But perhaps there\u2019s something. \n\nAnd yes we are agreed that there\u2019s no legal requirement or any moral requirement for OP to include an adopted-as-an-adult sister, or any sibling for that matter, in her wedding party. It\u2019s her and her fianc\u00e9s wedding, no one else should have a say in how their day plays out.", "Effectively that is true. They would have needed her bio parents to sign off on the adoption. It was probably always their intention, they just had to wait.", "NTA\n\nJust don't invite anyone, get them out of your life, if they love her as much as a daughter, let them have her, you will have your own family and I want to believe that you get along very well with your future husband's family\n\nSo let's be honest it won't be a big loss", "NTA \n\nBut your parents, sister, and sister's BFF are. She bullied you and made you feel unwelcome in your own home while they stood by and watched. \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding. I wish you and future husband nothing but health and happiness.", "NTA.  Your wedding,  your choice. Also, just because your parents adopted a fullass adult (weird and creepy, imo) doesn't make that person your sister. You have zero obligation to her. Including any obligation to invite her to your wedding at all.", "NTA at all", "Its your wedding and you only get one. The day is to short to do what other people wants you to do.\n\nAsk your sister and not her friend or dont, you dont even have to invited best friend choice is yours. \n\nIf your parents make it a drama, confront them and explain how you feel neglected and how a \u201cfriend\u201d was more importen than their own daughter and uninvited them if they cant accept its your wedding. Life is too short for people who cant support at stand up for you, speciel when its family", "Pleae update", "NTA - My best friend and *only* my best friend was by my side during my wedding.\n\nI have four (4) half sisters by blood; two maternal and two paternal. The two from my mother did not even know they were my half sisters until they were older (our mother\u2019s husband/their father adopted me). The two from my father did not know I existed for awhile. \n\nWhen I got married, the person I was closest to was my best friend since I was a small child. She had always been there. I chose her. \n\nMy wedding. My choice. \n\nYour wedding. Your choice. \n\nYou are taking the high road here and if they can\u2019t see that, everyone can piss off.", "NTA, and drop the rope with them. THEY chose their family, you choose yours."]}
