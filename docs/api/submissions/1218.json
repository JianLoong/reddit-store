Your mother sounds emotionally abusive.", "NTA - you are right that your mom has most definitely experienced emotional trauma. And instead of ending cycle of abuse, your mom is perpetuating it.\n\nAs a 15-year-old, It is not your job to look after your mother\u2019s emotions. she is being manipulative and by guilting you she is ignoring the hurt she caused,  and manipulating you to focus on her fake hurt. \n\n\nYour mom is holding you to higher standards Then she is able to hold her self to. You are a child\u2026.you are a teenager. She is an adult. It is her job to look after your emotional well-being. It is not your job to look after her emotional well-being.\n\nI am very sorry you\u2019re experiencing this. She won\u2019t change. She is likely a narcissist, or has borderline personality Disorder. the best you can do is accept her for who she is and try your very best to not let it affect you.. but it of course will.\n\nLook into some books on parents with narcissism, border personality disorder, or even just emotional immaturity. Most local libraries let you sign up online and you can link to an app that will let you download books and audio books so no one has to know what you\u2019re doing. \n\nMy mom is also like this. Thankfully I\u2019m 32 and I don\u2019t have to live with it anymore. I\u2019ve been spending my 30s reflecting on my childhood and dealing with the trauma. My mom yelled at my sister the way your mom is yelling at you. My mom did not allow me to have emotions, besides \u201chappy perfect child\u201d.  I was not allowed to be sad, mad, god forbid I cry. I have a distinct memory of my mom telling me that I am not allowed to cry.\n\nBecause of this, I\u2019m a hyper independent people pleaser. I want everyone to like me and I freak out internally, (of course never visibly) if anyone does not like me or if I get insulted. I don\u2019t let other people in. I have huge walls built as I\u2019ve learned I can\u2019t trust other people with my emotional well being\u2026The only person I can trust is myself.  I have anxiety and I\u2019m a pro at having anxiety attacks around ppl without them knowing. It breaks my bfs heart\u2026he tells me to tell him when it happens and I just CAN\u2019T. \n\nNow don\u2019t feel too bad for me, as ugly as all that is. I bought my own house by myself at 25. I make 6 figures. My hyper independence does have a good side.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? I\u2019m not sure. Maybe I see myself in this situation. Hopefully something I said here is useful? \n\nUnfortunately growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, we didn\u2019t have all these great tools that you have.  Even Reddit can be so helpful\u2026 here  you can learn from other people and talk about this and learn that this upbringing  isn\u2019t normal. I thought this was normal. I thought this was life. \n\nI remember watching an episode I think Lizzy McGuire, and in the episode, Lizzie and her mom got into a fight. After the fight, the mom reflected, knocked on Lizzys door, and when she was allowed in, she apologized genuinely to Lizzy. I distinctly remember thinking \u201cwhat Disney garbage. Moms don\u2019t do that. moms would never apologize.\u201d I was so warped into thinking my family situation was normal. \n\nSo yeah\u2026long story short, you will NEVER be the asshole in this situation.

That\u2019s your mother\u2019s fault, she saw the way her parents treated her and decided that she was going to treat her child the same way. I doubt that you would make that choice. All of the things that you feel bad about are normal teenager thing, things children are supposed to do. Do not feel bad, you are not a bad kid, it sounds like you have a bad mom. i\u2019m so sorry, but don\u2019t internalize her hatred and anger, you are so much more than what she thinks you are. NTA"]}
