She was 13 when her father and I started dating, and sadly, she has always blamed me for her parents separation, despite the fact they'd been divorced for several years before we even met.\n\nOver the years, I've tried hard to connect with her by taking her on expensive vacations, having girls days with her at the spa, or taking her to dinner. Two years ago, she even moved in with us rent-free for several months while she was between jobs. (Though we eventually had to ask her to leave because of excessive partying, as we have two younger children).\n\nDespite my efforts to build a relationship, it just hasn't worked. My stepdaughter is passive-aggressive towards me at best and, at worst, tells other family members I'm a \"wicked stepmum\", spreads lies about me to other family members, and has actively plotted to break me and her father up. I was understanding of this behaviour when she was a teen, but now that she's a fully grown adult, I have very little time or patience for this behaviour.\n\nMy stepdaughter has recently broken up with her boyfriend and is once again between jobs. She asked her father if she could move in with us again until she was back on her feet. However, I've told my husband I feel uncomfortable with this because of her excessive partying and also because of the way she treats me. I've suggested an alternative: helping her financially rather than letting her move back in. My husband agreed this was a good solution and spoke to her about it.\n\nMy stepdaughter, however, was not happy and is blaming me for \"keeping her from her father and younger siblings\". Her mother has also emailed me to say that stepdaughter is going through a tough time mentally and could use our support.\u00a0Regardless, I don't want her to move in.

The \u201cenough is enough\u201d moment is when you two decide to put your foot down. The ideal time for that moment can\u2019t be decided by the Reddit community, but anytime an adult-child starts \u201cnegotiating\u201d what she wants, we as parents have to admit to ourselves that we missed the mark. She isn\u2019t a child and could start trying to find solutions to her own problems if you allow her to. She has to have practice with that or she\u2019s never going to grow up. \n\nYou and hubby need to focus on how to make sure your younger kids are raised to be better. \n\nAnd lest the Reddit world start firing back, yes-I have a 26 yo myself + 2 more who are 23 and 20. They\u2019re all graduated from college and fully 100% independent. It IS possible to raise actual adults in a timely manner.

She is now trying to manipulate you through her mother as well. She doesn't have to live in the same building to come and see her father and her younger siblings and supporting her financially is quite a generous offer already. Stand your ground together with your husband, you have experience what her living with you was like recently - she doesn't seem to have changed her ways or acknowledge the need to change, so why would you expect different behavior now?", "Nta you're still trying to help her, but don't want to line with her based on her own behavior. That's fair.", "INFO.  Why doesn\u2019t she stay with her mother?\n\nIf it\u2019s a matter of money you could send the support money to the bio mom.

I shoul'n't have to share your house with someone who doesn't respects you, spreads lies about you and has tried to sabotage your relationship.

She needs to GTFU, make better choices, and learn that the world doesn't revolve around her unresolved daddy issues. That is your home. Not hers. Those are your children, and they deserve to be protected. There's no telling what she's saying to them when you're not around. It's generous of you to offer her financial assistance, especially since she's 26 and keeps making the same bad choices. Her dad can offer lots of emotional support without her moving in with you.

I'd be wary of even financially supporting her at this point, particularly if this kind of behavior is how she repays you. You've tried it before and it didnt work out well at all.
