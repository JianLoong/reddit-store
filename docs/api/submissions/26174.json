She was 13 when her father and I started dating, and sadly, she has always blamed me for her parents separation, despite the fact they'd been divorced for several years before we even met.\n\nOver the years, I've tried hard to connect with her by taking her on expensive vacations, having girls days with her at the spa, or taking her to dinner. Two years ago, she even moved in with us rent-free for several months while she was between jobs. (Though we eventually had to ask her to leave because of excessive partying, as we have two younger children).\n\nDespite my efforts to build a relationship, it just hasn't worked. My stepdaughter is passive-aggressive towards me at best and, at worst, tells other family members I'm a \"wicked stepmum\", spreads lies about me to other family members, and has actively plotted to break me and her father up. I was understanding of this behaviour when she was a teen, but now that she's a fully grown adult, I have very little time or patience for this behaviour.\n\nMy stepdaughter has recently broken up with her boyfriend and is once again between jobs. She asked her father if she could move in with us again until she was back on her feet. However, I've told my husband I feel uncomfortable with this because of her excessive partying and also because of the way she treats me. I've suggested an alternative: helping her financially rather than letting her move back in. My husband agreed this was a good solution and spoke to her about it.\n\nMy stepdaughter, however, was not happy and is blaming me for \"keeping her from her father and younger siblings\". Her mother has also emailed me to say that stepdaughter is going through a tough time mentally and could use our support.\u00a0Regardless, I don't want her to move in.

It's generous of you to offer her financial assistance, especially since she's 26 and keeps making the same bad choices. Her dad can offer lots of emotional support without her moving in with you.

Your adult stepdaughter spreading rumours and treating you badly is bullying you for basically existing.", "NTA \nYou have the right to not be disrespected in your own home. I'd be wary of even financially supporting her at this point, particularly if this kind of behavior is how she repays you. You've tried it before and it didnt work out well at all.

I am currently thinking you are NTA, but again this needs further details IMO.\n\nI have so many questions: why is she relying only on her father and not her mother? what is her excuse to party so much while being in between jobs? Why does she still disrespect you, is it a lack of boundaries, or is her father enabling this behavior?\n\nWhy does she refuse to accommodate the request you and your husband made? I mean, she is not banned from the house she just won't be living with all of you, that's it. Which is rather normal at 26.\n\nWhy does she resent you so much as a grown adult, I feel like the whole dynamic on how you met your current husband would probably explain her behavior (I am not excusing her, btw; I just wanted clarity).\n\nAnyway she's an adult, she should be grateful to be receiving some help, regardless of her expectations, many would not receive any, again if her mother feels it's a touchy moment maybe she should step in, not emailing you, which I find rather convenient.\n\nAlso, her attachment to the father is somewhat twisted, perhaps therapy could help her, it's almost as if she's the ex-wife. Plus, she needs to stand on her own legs and to stop relying on her father for financial help and stop finding excuses to not be independent.\n\nIf this is becoming a pattern, I think you guys should reinforce your boundary and leave at that to prevent this becoming a bigger problem.", "If her mother wants her to have support, then SHE can house her.\n\nYour husband needs to tell her this was his decision after her behavior last time.

As for the rent, we'll work something out", "If this occurs in a decade for one of your own children what would you do??", "NTA. Why is her mom calling you instead of opening her door.

You need to look that woman straight in the eye and tell her that because she cannot respect you as a human being and has actively dismissed you over the years, and tried to drive a wedge between you and her dad and other family members, she is not welcome in your home.

She can live with her mom if she really needs a place to live.

Her parents divorce obviously hit her hard and now that she's an adult maybe you two can work through it and get peace?", "NTA. If the mother is that concerned, then she should take her daughter in. If not, STFU.", "The mother can take her in. Not your problem.", "NTA. She is a full grown adult. It was generous to offer financial support. Once she started spreading rumors and trying to purposely damage your marriage she lost her chance to live with you..she sounds like she has mental health issues and needs therapy. I would not let her around my young children..Her mother can let her.daughter  live with her.", "Nta. She treats you like shit, for years. Shes a grown up, and a mean one. Let her mother take her in this time., she can see her dad whenever she wants to, just not in your house. And stop wasting your time trying with her.", "NTA.  Her mother can take her in if she needs support.  You are offering financial assistance because her lifestyle is such that she refuses to respect you or your house rules.  You could just say No and leave her on her own.  She is entitled, lies about you, and doesn't deserve to live in your house.", "She's 26? The time to indulge her passive aggressive behavior is over. No need to have her toxicity in your home plus your husband has your back. Definitely NTA.", "NTA & if her mom is that concerned why doesn\u2019t SHE take in her own daughter?", "Why doesn't her mother take her in? She doesn't like you, is passive aggressive towards you, tells lies but wants to move into your home? How does this work exactly? Let her go to her mom's place. \nNTA", "She is 26. Some people are paying off mortgages on their own homes and holding a steady job at 26. Some people are married and have children. Some people are employers running their own businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s time for your stepdaughter to sort herself out.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAnd even after such treatment you found a good compromise that doesn't harm anyone, and communicated it to your husband.\n\nAlthough I wander did you talk with your husband in the past about her behaviour? \n\nAnd did she go to therapy or something similar?\n\n\n\nStepdaughter is an adult. She should see that you tried to be a good stepmother (and if what you said is correct then you did an exceptional job at trying to bond with her and be a good parental figure). She should grow up and start acting her age.", "NTA\n\nYou are entitled to feel safe in your home. Your step daughter ensures you do not. She is an adult and can therefore figure it out herself. Or go to her own mother.", "So NTA. It sounds like you've done everything you can to foster a relationship with her, and although many times there is resentment on the side of the step-kid, you'd think it would have dissipated, Or at the very least she would be mature enough to stop using it as an argument.", "NTA. Stepmother here. I know when we love our children we park part of our dignity to the curb sometimes. She\u2019s an adult. She can\u2019t act like an adult then those are the consequences of her actions. She 26 not 6. \n\nDon\u2019t let her in your home again. That\u2019s on her. If her mother has such an issue, her mother can take her in. I\u2019d make this a hard line.", "Right?! Why doesn't her mom take her in, if she's so worried about her daughter?", "The step daughter appears to be in the FO stage of FAFO.", "100%. I have a great relationship with my parents but they set the boundary at a young age (in a totally different economy so no judgement on this generation of young adults) that once I was an adult I needed to be self sufficient which involved living outside of their home, whether alone or with a partner or roommates.  I always had a key and could stay over at their house any time if I needed physical help (recovering from surgery) or just for convenience (out late with friends and their house was closer to work) but I couldn't live there.  When I had hard times they supported me emotionally and helped me pay my bills but I still lived outside of their home.  \n\nYou are doing more than just helping your stepdaughter get through a tough time, you are teaching her independence while providing a safety net.  I hope your husband agrees you are NTA.", "[removed]", "THIS. Tell it to hubby straight. Why keep pandering to someone who's so rude and disrespectful? You don't want her in the house, you don't want her around the other kids, and until she smartens up and quits with the s\\*\\*\\*, she doesn't get a cent of your money.", "So, to answer some questions. \n\n- Her mother also drinks and parties excessively and their relationship is rocky. One day they can be best friends, the next day worst enemies. \n\n- I think her mother is partially to blame for my stepdaughters poor attitude to me. They had been divorced FIVE years before I was set him with him via mutal friends. However, the ex wife has voiced to her daughter they'd have eventually gotten back together if not for me. (They divorced because she was unfaithful btw). \n\n- we live pretty far away (a twelve hour drive or 3 hour flight) so I guess she feels like if she can't live with us so doesn't get opportunity to see her father and siblings as much. Though he does fly out to visit her every couple of months. We also tried to set her up with a job here last time she stayed, but she just wanted to party and date boys. \n\n- her father and I have suggested therapy and offered to help her find a therapist and pay. She's declined.", "Yeah I feel like there has to be a lot left out here lol\n\nIf I take it at face value it's NTA for sure.\n\nBut like....what 26 y/o would prefer to move in with parents, one of whom she clearly does not like, than get financial help to live alone?\n\nWhy is she referred to as \"wicked\"? Is the daughter really just an asshole and hates her for absolutely no reason? \n\nWhy can't she jsut move in with her bio mom?", "She\u2019s 26, time for her to make her own home.", "Because she knows exactly who her daughter is , and probably enjoys the thought that she\u2019s making the ex and Op life difficult.", "Exactly. The poor thing is going through a tough time and could use her support. How heartless of her to force her own daughter to have to ask to live with her wicked stepmother!", "I don\u2019t understand why the stepdaughter is even upset here. Dad and step mom are willing to help financially. So she can live on her own with financial support from them. Wouldn\u2019t that be better than moving back in with your dad and his wife????\n\nEven if she\u2019s looking for emotional support, she can still get it from her dad without living with them. Phones exist and she can visit. This is mind boggling.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I would say it\u2019s more likely the case of someone who have already passed the hot potato doesn\u2019t want to get the potato again", "Sounds like she just enjoys playing victim to everyone.", "> I don\u2019t understand why the stepdaughter is even upset here.\n\nShe wanted one thing and her step-mom suggested giving her something different. Doesn't matter that it's better, the issue is it was step-mom's idea.", "Well if she can\u2019t move in, she can\u2019t take out her frustrations on OP. her father needs to remind her that the last time she moved in, she wasn\u2019t able to coexist with his wife very well and that was stressful for everyone. As much as he loves her, it\u2019s time for her to find other housing and the most they can offer at this time is financial support. Seems like she just wants to bounce from boyfriend to home to boyfriend so someone else is always responsible for her.", "OP also had the hot potato and has activated her anti-potato shield", "NTA I was in the same situation except it was my wife and her son.  I told her I simply couldn\u2019t live with her son because I truly believed her son would end up coming between us somehow someway.  He never moved in.", "TLDR.  Didn\u2019t need to read.  Yes.  You are 100% the asshole.", "I\u2019m like 90% sure I\u2019ve read this exact story on here before.", "Mom emailed? Why doesn\u2019t mom let her move in?", "Info: how much partying was excessive?", "NTA.  She is reaping what she sowed.", "Nta. Your house, you decide who lives in it. If she wants to live there she needs to treat you better, pretty simple.", "Commenting on AITA (F46) for refusing to let my stepdaughter (F26) move in ?...", "NTA.  Stepdaughter turning down cash to be in your home shows something else is up.  Whether it\u2019s because she wants to be clothed/fed/cleaned up after in addition to being housed or if she\u2019s just there to screw with your family dynamic, who knows, but something is up.", "NTA.  Wait a minute.  Stepdaughter\u2019s mother emailed you to say she needs the support?  Why doesn\u2019t stepdaughter move in with her mother?\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t invite someone who is somewhat abusive to you to live in your home.  Supporting her while she makes her own way in the world is more than generous.", "NTA.\n\nIf her bio mother cares enough to offer her opinion about daughter's mental state, then she should offer up her home to her child. Otherwise, she can stay out of it. You have good reason for your reluctance and the daughter is mid-twenties, not a child by any stretch of the imagination.", "NTA. She's an adult she can figure it out. You have boundaries.  She can live with her mom if the mom is so worried.", "NTA she's 26 and she can go and live with her mum if the mum says she needs support, only help her to get to her mum's house", "NTA. However, I have the best relationship with my step mom thanks to her letting me move in and long conversations about life.  It was a really good opportunity for me to get to know her, and now she's like a real mom to me.", "NTA. Also, If her mother believes her daughter needs your support, then why doesn\u2019t SHE do it then?", "See the fable of the scorpion and the frog.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog", "NTA this chick needs to get her shiz together", "Perfect!  OP NTA", "Right, this wicked woman took her on expensive vacations, dinners, and spa days. How awful.", "100 percent. OP is under no obligation to support a 26-year-old. Sounds like she endured a lot when stepdaughter was young, and she handled it with grace. It also sounds like stepdaughter has had a lot of enablers in her life: her parents, boyfriends who were supporting her, etc. and maybe it\u2019s time she learns to support herself. The fact that OP is offering to financially help is way more than anyone should expect.", "SD definitely acting spoil. Definitely no consequences for her actions growing up. Both parents fault.\n\nThe SD has tried to ruin OP's marriage recently. \n\nThe daughter is an adult,  its past time she got over her father re-marrying, especially when SD's dad met OP years after her bio-parents got divorced. Her anger is misplaced, but that's not stopping her from slandering OP now. \n\nOP is in her rights to refuse SD in her home.   She'll try again to ruin their marriage, say things to her half-siblings to cause trouble, and misbehave again. \n\nSD can move in with friends, her bio mom,  ask this relatives she's been talking trash too.", "Yeah and a lot of people aren\u2019t. Most young adults (let alone older Americans as well in this day and age) nowadays have no nest egg to speak of and are living with multiple roommates. A sudden change in living situation like a breakup can be a really big problem. I get what you\u2019re saying but it\u2019s kind of dismissive. \u201cSorting herself out\u201d still requires her having a place to stay while she does so, doesn\u2019t it? \n\nOf course, there\u2019s her mother\u2019s as well. But I just wanted to point that out!", "This means she has to cook, clean and buy groceries. At dads house she just needs to breathe. Eveything else is taken care of.", "Because then she can\u2019t say bad stuff about OP to her younger siblings.", "Sounds like the stepdaughter\u2019s version of emotional support is probably thinking of new ways to torture OP.", "I guess I\u2019m giving the stepdaughter too much credit and assuming she lives like an otherwise regular 26 year old and would like the freedom to bring a random person back to her place for a good old fashioned post break up rebound. But I guess it\u2019s more fun being weirdly passive aggressive to your step mom than going out with friends, drinking, doing drugs, and hooking up with hot strangers.", "OMG! Can I get the anti-potato shield too, please? I have a 30 yo step potato that I need it for.", "Anyone can activate their anti-potato shield, it takes perseverance and the willingness to put your foot down.
