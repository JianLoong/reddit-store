Yes it's a little rooster too but unless your'e a multigenerational chicken farmer nobody here thinks of it that way.  \n\nSo for the sake of your little girl being brought up in the good 'ol USA stop yelling 'There's my little penis!' at your daughter.

I think you are aware of the connotations of that word, and banning MIL for raising a valid concern is a big overreach.
