My wife and I have a daughter who is 6, I have a few pet names for her which are very common and normal where i'm from, they are cock/cocker/cockle. My parents used them for me when I was growing up, as did aunts/uncles and also parents of my friends, like I said, common and normal.\n\nAnyway, about a week or so ago I get home from work and greet my daughter with a \"Yoreet cock, how was your day at school...\" etc and my MIL was visiting at the time and obviously overheard it, but didn't react in the moment. Later on that evening, after she'd gone home, she gives me a ring and starts giving me an earful about how i'm \"sexualising\" my daughter by giving her \"such a disgusting pet name\". I argued back telling her it was disgusting that she would even attribute my pet name for my own daughter to me trying to sexualise her and until I get an apology, she's banned from my house and from seeing my daughter.\n\nAll week since, my phone and facebook have been blowing up with relatives on my wife's side telling me how innapropriate, evil and sadistic i'm being with my pet name for my daughter and for denying her access to my home (MIL refuses to apologise and we were supposed to host christmas dinner this year, so until I get an apology, she isn't coming for that).\n\nAITA here?\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow, this blew up, not a chance i'm going to be able to reply to all the comments, so i'll clarify a few things here;\n\n* When I greet my daughter with cock/cocker/cockle, I do it in my own home, which is where I was when MIL overheard me. Some of you seem to get the impression that I'm strutting around town screaming cock at my daughter at the top of my lungs for every Tom, Dick and Harry to hear.\n* Secondly, It was pretty funny to see an awful lot of people ruffle their feathers and proceed to explain with haughty condescension that \"cock\" was actually slang for \"penis\" here in the US of A. Yeah, it is also slang for \"penis\" in the UK too, only I wasn't calling my daughter \"*a\"* cock. Words can have different meanings depending on context and phrasing, which I know is also the case here in America. I see a man call his six year old daughter cock and I don't jump to \"porn phrasing, ew\". The same goes for the Fanny example that i've seen a lot in the comments, because while it can be used as slang for vagina, it can also be used as a name.\n* A few have asked what my wife thinks of the name, I answered this in a comment, but since it's probably buried by now, i'll re-iterate here;  She's fine with it, we ended up going over it years ago when she came to my grandparents house for christmas about a year after we first got  together. She overheard my uncle call my cousin cock at dinner and asked me about it afterwards. She's also supportive of the MIL's ban from the house until I get an apology.\n* Lastly, i've seen a lot of people imply that it's an outdated and archaic way of talking in the UK, but it's definitely not where i'm from. It's still common parlance in and around Manchester where i'm from.", "created_utc": 1670959516, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl4e8m/aita_for_using_a_pet_name_for_my_daughter_and/", "score": 2433, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you are aware of the connotations of that word, and banning MIL for raising a valid concern is a big overreach.

To the American ear, you are insulting your daughter.", "Ehh just because you can, doesn't mean you should.", "I\u2019m not attacking you, but I think it\u2019s interesting that when Americans say \u201chey, in our culture this means x and it\u2019s rude\u201d we are called out accepting of other cultures and being puritanical Americans. At the same time when we are in other countries and do something that the locals consider rude the response is \u201chey, how dare you not learn and confirm to the culture of the country you are visiting\u201d and are considered rude for not researching the country we are visiting.", "Right?  Like this is just cultural. As someone that moved within the United States there are plenty of terms that I used growing up that I don\u2019t say now because it just causes confusion for people. It\u2019s not a big deal.", "So many of the comments are missing this. It's not \"cock CAN mean penis in the US,\" it's \"cock means penis.\" The equivalent is not calling your daughter \"Fanny,\" it's calling her \"vulva.\"", "Y\u2019all Non-Americans have such an issue comprehending that certain things y\u2019all say simply aren\u2019t the best in our culture. I think a teacher here would genuinely report it if a kid mentioned being called cock. It\u2019s purely sexual here. There is no endearment.", "Nah, I\u2019ll take all of your bits! \ud83e\udd23 \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of people here with sticks up their butts and very boring yet very American ethnocentrism.", "American slang for a signature is a John Hancock. You have to say cock to say it. Obviously Americans need to change their slang so that Americans aren't offended. If not, other Americans will bully them.", "I\u2019d totally forgotten about buggerlugs! Mum would give me the \u201cOi buggerlugs\u201d call when I was getting a fake telling off - it\u2019s very much the same in Scotland, the more I love the person the more I take the piss, it\u2019s just how we are - I\u2019m sure to folk from other parts of the world my interactions with my husband, mother, kids etc would seem \u201coff\u201d but they don\u2019t need to understand the intricacies of our relationships to accept them for what they are and not place their own standards on us that we don\u2019t want or need.", "She likes another kid and calls them a cock.  Teacher intervenes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong?  My daddy calls me his little cock when he hugs me at night!\u201d\n\nCPS intervenes.", "I literally just text my 18yr old daughter who got a warning at work for being off too much saying \u201cyou\u2019ll just need to stop being a fanny\u201d - her reply was just laughing emojis - honestly, fanny isn\u2019t overly offensive and we are very aware of the way Americans use the word so no one would give a rats ass if you went around saying fanny to everyone - we understand language differences and context - now, if you came to Scotland be called someone a Tory, that would be fighting talk", "I think the words are about or related to the heart. Heart cockles...?", "But why should OP change his heritage because those around him won\u2019t get their mind out of the gutter? He\u2019s from a different country to you. Different countries use words differently. I\u2019m a different area to OP but could guess he was from the North West with the word cocker.", "Immigrants should be able to speak their language in the privacy of their own home without you Americans policing how they speak.", "fancy a babby\u2019s yed and pey wet???", "Cockles are mollusc", "My reading comprehension is just fine. You think living daily life, that he's not going to call her that by accident in front of friends?\n\nDoesn't matter--I see by his update he's doubled down, so, Cock it is.", "I don't think it's sexual, but shocking to hear a child called a word that is just not used that way here. Like reading Agatha Christie, and seeing old women called \"pussies\". Took me a second to figure out that is was not an insult, just calling them sort of soft and gentle, like a well behaved cat.", "All the puritans get shipped over here and you wonder why Americans freak out over sex?", "Why do you think nobody uses Dick or Willy anymore?\n\nBoth of those have died out specifically because of the connotation", "What about a Smack barm?", "Yes, but mollusks are heart shaped!", "This is what I always think of when I hear Fanny! I grew up in the 90s/00s so it was always funny to read it, but I understood that the books were written when it was still a common name. NGL I think it's silly that they've been reprinted with new names - it is not that hard to explain to kids that it used to be a common name but has now become more commonly used as \"naughty\" slang.", "Indeed it's particularly interesting when you want to bum one.", "OMG\n\nThe reddit i never  knew I needed.", "It was used as a name for vagina when I was a kid (from Yorkshire) and I\u2019m only 31.", "So we should also ban the names DICK, and Willy, cause some idiots might think of a penis?", "If Americans don't like using words that are popular in porn, what do they call their step-sisters? lol.", "Scouser here who went to college in St Helens. If I ordered cheese on toast the dinner ladies would say \u2018cheese on, cock\u2019 to confirm my order. We all found it hilarious but were definitely not offended!", "My main concern was the daughter herself saying it. While I worked with kids a lot of them would call their dolls, animals, sometimes friends by the same names their parents use - baby, sweety, peanut, etc. My niece called everything babygirl because that's what her mom called her. I get the nostalgia of calling your kid something you were called growing up, but if Cocker and cockle hit the same meaning why not just stick with those? Different words have different meanings in different places, even though it also means penies in uk, the secondary use of nickname for not exist in USA, and the imagery evoked by the word is very different. It's similar to the word cunt in Australia vs USA, you're just asking for trouble.", "Go on YouTube and search Irn Bru (Scotland\u2019s soda that beats Coca Cola sales) and Fanny. Trust me. You will not regret it!", "Lol Iive in the land of Scouse it's a similar level of insult here. Or even worse call someone a Sun reader. The worst insult to shout at a Scouser is \"Yer Ma reads the Sun\".", "Same, I'm glad you asked because I had just assumed the daughter's name was Yoreet."]}
