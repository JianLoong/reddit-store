Yes it's a little rooster too but unless your'e a multigenerational chicken farmer nobody here thinks of it that way.  \n\nSo for the sake of your little girl being brought up in the good 'ol USA stop yelling 'There's my little penis!' at your daughter.

I think you are aware of the connotations of that word, and banning MIL for raising a valid concern is a big overreach.

FWIW I have *no* interest in reviving horrible names like that (which was my point, but lost to my poor delivery).", "One wouldn't know from your comment.", "Cocker is more common and it very much is an older generation thing.  So he could achieve the same thing without using a word that has a different meaning.  I mean my SO says c*** all the time being Scottish but he doesn\u2019t dare say it around my family because ya know Americans and he\u2019s not an AH\n\nETA:  Also being told it\u2019s more common to use for friends and duck is more common for children.  So my opinion stands.  OP is just using it to sound edgy and crying victim when he\u2019s called an AH.", "Does any of that change the fact that no one in America uses the word \"cock\" as an affectionate nickname for a child? No. It doesn't. We could argue which country has a \"mentality issue\" because of that, but it will not change reality. \n\nCock means a man's penis in America. That is not going to change anytime soon. Kids will make fun of you if your damn shoes are too cheap. Why would they NOT make fun of you for being nicknamed after genitals?!", "But OP sticking his head in the sand to insist that it SHOULDN\u2019T be an issue doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t become an issue in the society that he is choosing to live within.\n\nThere are plenty of stories on here where people pick names that are setting up their kids for a harder life and they\u2019re considered an AH for it. While cock shouldn\u2019t follow her forever, it could follow her all through elementary school. It\u2019s shortsighted to not consider that.", "I absolutely would if one of their common words was a slur or curse word in the USA.\n\nIt has nothing to do with Americans thinking we're high and mighty, it has to do with common sense. If the vast vast majority of people in a country know a word as one thing, you should probably understand and use caution with that word", "No, it\u2019s about considering what his daughter will deal with once it gets out that that\u2019s her nickname at home. He\u2019s so focused on \u201cmy history!\u201d He\u2019s not considering her future experiences. OP went to a school where that was a commonly used nickname, and he\u2019s really underestimating what it could be like for her to be in a school where it is not.", "Liverpool. Maybe it's just not a Scouse thing", "It makes more sense that his parents called him that. Maybe he strutted around when he was little. Calling his daughter that is extremely weird. Call her your little chickie or any other nickname that doesn\u2019t mean penis in the country you are residing in. YTA", "Oh whatever. People aren't allowed to carry some of their own culture over, just because you think it's weird? It doesn't work that way.   \n\n\nAnd what's more, this wasn't OP flaunting it. This was OP greeting his daughter, *in their own home*. MIL doesn't get to come into OP's house and tell him how he should and shouldn't act, cultural ignorance or otherwise. It's simply none of MIL's business, and if she's going to live in ignorance, that's not OP's fault.", "Not now that she is away at university, but they did when she was at school. If i ever used it in front of her friends, and I doubt I did, it would have only been in front of her closest friends, ie people who wouldn\u2019t bully her. \n\nIt\u2019s called situational awareness, don\u2019t purposely embarrass your children. Most good parents have this.", "That's what I'm saying.  I think now that he has been made aware that there is an issue, he could potentially revise it (like you said \"cocker\" instead of \"cock\") just to avoid further conflict - but he should get to use the nickname without being branded a sadistic sexualizing jerk.", "Key words, IN AMERICA", "If you told a child to sit on their fanny, to you that means sit down on your ass. If you said you were gunna open your fanny pack, that\u2019s normal to many Americans. Here that means something WILDLY different, but with a little explanation nobody would even care and would probably find it funny. We are from completely different cultures, I much prefer ours.", "That\u2019s the part I agreed with you on but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ignorant about the meaning.  I think he said it to annoy his MIL.  So he\u2019s AH for acting ignorant and an AH for crying here about it.", "Which is where op lives and is raising his daughter.", "Prefer what you want. Calling a little girl a cock in the USA is extremely bad form. It really isn't that difficult a concept", "Fair enough and to be fair I do get some of what you Americans are saying. But he is from another culture.", "And I understand that, too. I wouldn't be saying this if they were living back home, I think from your perspective it's actually a very cute thing. It's just that this is the culture his daughter is surrounded by, now. If I didn't think it was going to hurt her eventually, I wouldn't say anything.", "Obviously it\u2019s on another level and I do get that you definitely do not mean it this way whatsoever and get your point completely, but that mentality on an industrial scale on both sides of the pond is one of the reasons why we still have racism and xenophobia. I personally would drop the nickname tbf but he shouldn\u2019t really have to."]}
