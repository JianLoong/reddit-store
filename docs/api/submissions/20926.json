I still have a lease on an apartment until September 31st, but I've been slowly moving into my fiance's house since our engagement.  She has 2 kids from a previous relationship (19F & 16M) and they both have rooms at her house even though her daughter has been living with her BF for a year.  There is one spare bedroom at her house and before I moved in I asked if I could turn that room into a gaming/hobby room so that I could have a space in the house that I could kind of call my own.  She did not have a problem with this.  I have already been contributing to some bills and other household expenses since I've been living with them pretty much full-time now.  \n\nSo, over the past few weeks, her son and I have been bringing over my gaming and hobby stuff and putting it in that room.  He and I share a lot of the same interests, so it's actually been a pretty cool bonding experience for the 2 of us.  \n\nWell, last week her daughter came over and told my fiance that she's pregnant and wants to keep the baby.  She also said that she and her BF can't afford to live on their own and afford a baby, so they want to move back in with my fiance.  My fiance agreed right away and she told me about it after the fact.  She also told me that I would have to move all of my stuff out of the spare room because that would now be the baby's room.  \n\nI was pretty disappointed because her son and I had already put a fair amount of work into that room, but it's still her house and her daughter, so I didn't really feel like I have a say in the matter.  So, this past weekend, her son and I moved everything back to my apartment.  \n\nI have been staying at my apartment since then and I'm now considering extending my lease for another year.  My fiance and I had planned on having a Spring wedding next year, but she said that with her daughter's pregnancy, the wedding will probably be delayed until next fall at the earliest. \n\nWhen I told her I was considering extending my lease so that I would have space of my own since it sounds like her place would be pretty crowded for the foreseeable future, she did not like my idea.  I explained to her that I need to feel like I have space of my own, and that's not going to be possible at her house right now.  But she accused me of ditching out just because life got a little complicated. \n\nShe said that I should be doing everything I can to save money for our wedding and honeymoon and that throwing money away on a lease when I could live with her for much cheaper is a stupid idea.  But to me, the conditions of me moving in have drastically changed.  I was looking forward to sharing interests with her son, but now that has been taking away from us and 2 (eventually 3) more people have been added to the house.  \n\nI don't really know what this means for our relationship just yet, but I already feel like that house will never really feel like it's \"my home,\" too.

Honestly I think you need to evaluate the entire situation, if she unilateraly makes these types of decisions (daughter, boyfriend and soon to be grandchild moving in) and postponing the wedding I would be questioning what else is she going to decide on your behalf without consulting you because its her house? Are you ready to be a parent to a baby? Something tells me the 19yr old will heavily be relying on mom and soon to be step-dad to shoulder the child rearing duties. \n\nMaybe not, maybe everything is fine...only you have insight into the situation.", "Oh man, look. Keep your lease because:\n\n1. She's a mother with her own set of priorities \n2. Those priorities have shifted because of #1\n3. I think she expected you to pitch in with the bills now that her daughter is home (which is not fair because her daughter is now a grown up having a child, but thats a pretty big and different issue) \n\n\nLife just got tougher for her adukt daughter, not you. That's all on her. Your level of involvement with her adult daughter is optional for you, your fiance and her adult daughter.", "NTA.  You're not considering leaving the relationship because life got hard.  You're evaluating the relationship because there is literally no room for you in her home.   You need and deserve your own space.   If that's not possible in her home, then you need another space.  It's that simple.    \n\n\nNow, there are options.   She could sell her house and buy a bigger one.  You could build an addition, take over a garage, or add a 'she shed' type building to the yard, if there is space.   But the important part is that you both recognize and honor your need for space of your own.  If that can't happen on her property and she's not willing to sell it and move, then you need to keep a separate apartment.", "NTA - Keep the apartment.  Looks like things are changing quickly and you don't want to the odd man out.", "I think you should see this as a sign of things to come. She doesn\u2019t respect your needs or wants and doesn\u2019t think she needs to treat you as a partner who gets any kind of say over your own life. NTA", "NTA. Keep your lease. While the relationship doesnt necessarily have to end, you do have the right to your own space. If she doesn't have a \"time frame\"  for daughter & family to move (say like 2 years) then maybe consider if this relationship is what you want for the long haul.", "Is the daughters room so small that it would not fit bed for the baby?\n\nMaybe it is a cultural thing and it goes beyond me because of that... Where I live it is more common to keep the baby in parents bedroom.", "NTA if you were moving in and going to pay the bills then you get a vote on what happens there. Keep your place, save yourself the stress and see what happens.\n\nWhen is the daughter going to move out? It\u2019s nice she wants to help her daughter but all actions have consequences. It could take five years before the daughter and boyfriend move out.", "NTA! Daughter and Baby Daddy need to figure out things, baby could have slept in their room for a while. They are now going to be parents which means they are full fledge adults at this point, something tells me they are going to use your Fiancee as a free babysitter.\n\n Your Fianc\u00e9 while yes it's her house doesn't seem to have a lot of respect for you or your relationship in.", "NTA Seriously, not your circus, not your monkeys. I hate to say it, but your fiance wants you there to foot the bill for daughter, baby and baby daddy. Keep your own place. You will quickly find yourself taking care of a baby (if daughter isn't responsible enough to take care of herself and baby, she's going to be leaving said baby to go play while you two take care of said baby). You are not married. It sounds like she's not committed to you. Therefore, you need to take care of you. A committed relationship means just that, commitment. \n\nShe will be sorry, by the way. You sound like a catch (I'm married to a gaming dude). She will end up caring for her grandchild. I've seen this so many times.", "NTA You're fiancee can't have her cake and eat it too. Moving out of your own apartment into your fiancee's house with her children was going to be an adjustment for everyone. You've lived comfortably on your own for years and you need a certain amount of privacy for your own sanity. However, unforseen circumstances being what they are, now you're adding a teenage couple and a baby into the mix.\n\nI think taking a wait an see approach to all these changes is better than jumping in feet first. If she can move her pregnant daughter and her baby daddy into what was supposed to be a shared home, you can decide it's not the right time for the move and extend your lease. I think your cautious approach to this situation is wise and warranted.", "RUN!!!!\n\n(nta)", "\nNTA. Interesting situation.  You are supposed to save money by not having the space you were going to have and not re-upping your lease.  But she eon\u2019t be saving money because she is going to be supportive mg her daughter, her daughter\u2019s boyfriend, and a baby.  They can\u2019t afford a baby but are having one.\n\nYour fiancee quickly made decisions without you, told you the wedding must be postponed, etc., but she wants you to move in with her anyway because it will be easier to access your money if you live with her.  You won\u2019t be able to save anything. \n\nBabies die not get less expensive after a year.  Your fiancee will be babysitting so her daughter can have frequent breaks.  Your life in that household won\u2019t be about losing a room.\n\nSo keeping your lease for another year makes perfect sense.  You get to have your life since this isn\u2019t your daughter or your baby.  Paying rent and utilities and good will be a good reason for not paying for the baby.  It gives you time and space to find out how marrying into your fiancee\u2019s family is going to impact your life. \n\nMaybe your fiancee assumes her daughter will save money for a year snd get her own place.  But any person who reads reddits knows how that goes.", "Nta, definitely renew the lease. I don't see you marrying her, life got so much more complicated, have a safe distance to it. I mean yes, it's her daughter, but she put everything that is important to you on hold, does this sound like \"in sickness and health\" for you?", "NTA she seems to want the benefits of being the homeowner (not consulting you on changes), the benefits of a live in partner (time together + $$), but wants to sacrifice nothing. Meanwhile you get less private space, no say in the household and you get to pay for the privilege.", "Nah she isn't wrong to want to help her daughter, and you aren't wrong for not being happy she made a unilateral decision about a shared space.  \n\nYou def need to talk about it.  How far is she going to go in the name of help?  What if the daughter says, 'i changed my mind, i want to go to college sans baby'  Is grandma going to say, 'ok, I'll raise the kid'?  Hiw much babysitting is she going to do?  How much money is she going to spend\n\nShe has no problem spending *her* money on what she wants - the grandbaby- but thinks you shouldn't spend *your* money on what you want- a dedicated space.   So her money is hers and your money is.....also hers?\n\nI have a feeling the son is going to want to move in with you to get away from that cluster fuck.", "NTA\n\nEven without taking away the rec room that is going to be a disaster having to adjust to being overcrowded and having to help support two irresponsible people and their kid. \n\nSaw a post the other day where a woman wanted her BF to rent or sell his home so they could get one together because it would always be his home and she wouldn\u2019t really have any say in things. \n\nShe had it right. You may want to push for something like that as well if she really wants to live together permanently.", "NTA - Look you have a couple of serious issues with your fiance\n\n1.  She makes unilateral decisions without your input but that impacts you and tells you afterwards\n2. She obviously considers this \\*her\\* house. You would be, at best, a tenant and like #4 on the when it comes to your happiness and comfort, but probably #1 when it comes to financial contribution.\n3. Her reaction to your perfectly reasonable response is an attempt to be manipulative. \\*LISTEN TO WHAT SHE IS TELLING YOU\\*. She is litearay saying you need to suck up whatever the family needs regardless of how it negatively impacts you, AND you need to take on all the financial responsibility for it.\n\nI don't know if there is a future there but she isn't really treating you well. I can't fault her, I'm pretty sure she has told you, up front, that her kids will always be her priority.", "NTA You need to see how this relationship works out after the baby comes. I'll bet there are a lot more changes headed your way.", "NTA. There's no compromise being offered here. Her daughter's irresponsibility and your fiance's enabling of it has made this a much shittier situation for you. It's not fair to ask you to sacrifice this much", "NTA\n\nYou immediately accepted that her daughter would move in and that the baby would have that room. Deciding not to move in when the circumstances have changed so dramatically is more than reasonable.", "NTA. Your gf made a unilateral decision that impacts you. If this is what she does during an engagement, it will be immeasurably worse if you marry.\n          \nWhat has occurred is that you have been gifted a red-flag. Ignore it at your own peril.", "Well, at least you found out where you are on the pecking order.", "NTA. She's changed the dynamics of your mutual home and also shown you that marriage to you can take a back seat. It's clear that the baby will be there long-term.\n\nI think you're right to be re-evaluating your relationship because it seems unlikely she'll have much time for you once that baby is born.", "NTA, this just sounds so complicated. Can you move into a bigger place? I don't know how I would feel if she did all that without talking to me. If the daughter is adult enough to have a baby then she should be adult enough to take care of it. I have no children so I don't know and I also don't know if I would be ready to be a step-grandparent already I would say yes to extending your lease. And say, hey I am being understanding. You told me that she needs the space so I moved out but I am not going to give up my apartment when now there will be three extra people living with us.  To be happy I require my own space.", "NTA\n\nYour fiancee shouldn't have told her daughter she could move in without talking to you first.  \n\nI recommend you extend your lease and stop contributing money to your Fiancee's household (continue to contribute something for groceries and utilities if you spend much time there, but nothing beyond that).  There's a very good chance that your Fiancee would expect you to help contribute to her household in sufficient amounts to help support her daughter, daughter's BF, and the baby.  You're smart to keep yourself out of the mess that household is likely to become.\n\nIf you have the ability, and sufficient relationship, to do so, you might offer to let Fiancee's son come stay with you.  His Mom's house is going to get crowded and noisy, and having a refuge could be good for him.\n\nIf your relationship ends because your Fiancee overextended herself in caring for her daughter and grandbaby, then let it go.", "Give it a year and she\u2019ll be trying to move into your apartment.", "NTA. She has the right to prioritize her kids and future grandkids but you also have the right to be with a partner who prioritizes you or, at the very least, considers and consults you as a live-in fiance. \n\nI would not even continue the relationship.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine dealing with a 19 year old and her boyfriend living in the same place, much less with a newborn. Keep your apartment.", "NTA. You both have boundaries, she wanted to cross yours without asking if its okay. \n\nYou'll likely end up single. That's unfortunate for both of you. You'll both lose on this deal. \n\n**Why can't daughter move into your old apartment?** If you're paying rent anyways, it would allow you and your fiancee to live together. Its still expensive but makes it so you can maintain your relationship.", "NTA. Extremely inconsiderate. But September 31? Shenanigans. September has 30 days.", "NTA. She\u2019s made it clear by making this choice without even consulting you that your not equal to this relationship so what my bother to even stay in it. She makes all the choice and just expects you to follow along like a good little doggie.", "NTA and I would definitely extend your lease for another year.  You\u2019re going to need the time and space since your relationship is likely about to change drastically.", "Going with NAH. She isn't in the wrong to want to help her daughter out and it sounds a bit like you got one foot out the door.  At some point the decisions will have to be to prioritize the relationship or prioritize the individuals. You are both doing the later right now and eventually the relationship will probably drop.", "NAH. She's not the AH for letting her pregnant daughter move into the family home when she needs somewhere to stay. You are not the AH for feeling the  situation has changed and moving in now is going to be complicated. Pregnant daughter is not the AH for needing somewhere to stay.  \n\n\nMy own feeling would be for the two of you to sit down and talk through if you're agreed you still want to get married and if so when you'll both be ready to. And then figure out where you'll both be living with space for all the family. \"Saving for the wedding\" is one thing, but it sounds like what y'all should be doing is saving for a bigger house that will be both of yours for all the family.", "NTA. Hang on to your apartment just in case.", "NTA. The thought of living with a young couple and their baby....instead of a gaming room? Yeah, no.", "NTA - that's actually a very grown up way to handle it. If you can afford your own space, I'd suggest you keep it. You're completely right, it's her house and her house will be very crowded with her kids, grandkid, and daughter's bf.", "NTA. \n\nYou're not being heartless here.  Stuff has changed.  Change brings loss.  Moving in with a mother and son is way, way different than moving in with a mother, son, and a whole other family.", "NTA... yes to the year. She said yes to her daughter and rearranged the house without discussing this with you. This would affect you in a big way. She is not thinking like a couple yet. This needs another year.", "NTA\n\nKeep the lease, lose the woman. She didn\u2019t have you in mind when she made her choice, which means she doesn\u2019t see you as an actual partner. Plus, living with a baby SUCKS! Especially when it\u2019s not yours.", "Seems like you both have some thinking to do. She made a huge decision with out a thought to you. Not saying her child and grandchild shouldn\u2019t come first. But when your engaged, living together or married major decisions like this should be discussed. Sounds like she\u2019s going to have a lot going on and you may not want to deal with the drama that is about to happen. Three young adults, 2 about to become parents and not having a clue what they are getting into and add a screaming baby. All a disaster if you ask me. Might want to take a step back. Who wants to walk into messy if you don\u2019t have to. Messy could end up costing a lot and not just financially but you don\u2019t want that either.", "NTA\n\nNTA, but you are the meal ticket. \n\nYou\u2019re engaged to woman that got knocked up at 16/17 and again at 20. Her kid is having a kid at 19.  Their poor decision making is going to continue.  Extricate yourself and run.", "Keep your lease. Suggest she has some of here stuff there as well. When tje baby is here she is gonna want some alone, quiet time herself. That\u2019s can be your twos hideaway", "Tread carefully my Friend.  Trust your gut.", "NAH - I don't blame her for letting the daughter move back in or for you not wanting to move into that situation. Fyi - if you got married and moved in before the daughter got pregnant, you would either be letting the daughter move in or getting divorced.\n\nWhile paying a mortgage and rent isn't ideal, neither is fitting too many people into one house. Either find a bigger house you can buy together or move in and give the daughter your apartment. And since her daughter needs financial support, maybe skip the wedding and get married at the court house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your fiance's eagerness to help her daughter is admirable, but her unilateral decision making is a big concern.

And the best intentions don't prevent disagreements, frustrations, and feeling like it's too much. Having a place to \"retreat\" may help both of you. \n\nEither way, this is serious talk time. Why did she act without talking to you? How long does she expect to house her daughter's family? Childcare for baby and/or expectations for you to help as future step-grandpa?

Once she has a breather and she and OP speak like adults she may see the other side and help find a way for OP and Son to have their own space. \n\nLike getting a storage unit for Daughter's stuff, having the parents keep their baby in their room with them (Because seriously, an infant doesn't NEED its own room. Its nice, no denial there, but a baby can absolutely sleep in a crib in the corner of Mom and Dad's room without a bit of harm and iirc its actually good for them.) and giving back the game room. This might be doable to Daughter and BF if they aren't entitled little assholes, and OP never says Daughter is unreasonable or anything. She didn't demand or announce she was moving home, she asked her mother and was given an invitation. So she might accept \"Yes you can move home and get onto your feet, but the spare room is your brother and stepdad's bonding time so the baby's crib will have to be in your room with you.\"\n\nOr getting a shed for the backyard, insulating it with OP and Son, and having an electrician run some outlets so they can make a game clubhouse.

In her shoes, I'd be offering to help pay for the shed and improvements, and maybe offering to make them a Super Mario cushion for the game couch or something.\n\nBUT all of this depends on this being another of the optimistically more common \"OP and other side act like grown ups, talk it out, and reach a mature choice that benefits everyone.\" story and OP's GF not seeing him as a ATM.
