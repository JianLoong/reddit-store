His ex gf (28f) had their daughter in 2021. She\u2019s now almost 3 and such a lovely kid.\n\nBM and I have not really gotten along that well, we\u2019re civil at pickups and drop offs but we aren\u2019t friends at all. We both have very different views on a lot of things. She\u2019s very much on the crunchy/hippie mom type of thing. No big deal, everyone lives their lives in different ways and I don\u2019t have a problem with it. \n\nHis daughter started spending the weekends at our place and it\u2019s been a great time. Her mother gave me a list of all of her favorite foods which was perfectly fine because I wasn\u2019t sure what she liked at all. Now here\u2019s the issue, she buys all natural and some vegan style foods for their daughter. Once again no biggie she wants her daughter to eat healthy and all of that jazz BUT she has food stamps.. She is able to spend a good chunk of money on all of these foods for her daughter so she eats healthy. My bf and I don\u2019t have food stamps since we don\u2019t qualify for it (we actually tried to get them). \n\nWe had BM over for dinner so she could see the place and her eyes nearly burst out of her skull at some of the stuff I had. I got a good amount of off brand healthy stuff for their daughter. She started tell me that I needed the on brand stuff since it\u2019s all she buys and etc etc. After she left I talked to my bf about all of it and he said that he just wants to make BM happy and that we should just follow all of her rules and such. I rarely give my opinion on things regarding their daughter but I just can\u2019t hold back on this because it\u2019s starting to bother me and we really can\u2019t afford to get these things.\n\nSo, WIBTA for telling my boyfriend how to raise his daughter at our house?\n\nEdit for any confusion, when I said BM i meant baby mom, not bio mom. sorry for the confusion\n\nEdit 2: I would also like to add that our budget is between $200-$250 depending on what we need. He does give me money for her groceries and snacks specifically. Our last shopping trip we went over our budget to about $325 because I decided I would just buy the name brand stuff. We work out of finances on every check and split everything evenly for whatever we need like groceries, bills, rent, miscellaneous stuff we might need during the month.\n\nFinal Edit: Wow okay so I got a lot of mixed answers lol. I know the title seemed misleading I just didn\u2019t know how to phrase it at first. With all the comments I read and replied to really makes me feel like I wouldn\u2019t be the AH which I appreciate a lot. I\u2019m planning on talking to my boyfriend about everything and setting up boundaries and such with his ex gf. Thank you guys so much and I\u2019ll try to reply to more comments.", "created_utc": 1696591509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1719rqb/wibta_if_i_gave_my_input_on_how_to_raise_my_bfs/", "score": 283, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if he is paying for it all, it is taking away from someplace else.  It doesn't matter that she wants all name brand.  If you are going over budget by 30% every week, you can't afford it. \n\nYour BF's attitude is one of a child in a broken home \" he just wants to make BM happy \".  That is a co-dependent attitude.

He needs to make those decisions when his daughter is in your home, including what she eats.", "NTA. Your title is misleading. You\u2019re not looking to parent this child, you\u2019re being asked to feed her expensive food. Have your boyfriend shop and pay for everything the child needs. Problem solved. Not your responsibility to pay for this kid. Having a food budget is different than a parenting opinion. Having kids makes us moms a little protective, we want what\u2019s best for our kids. Sounds like baby\u2019s mama is doing that. However, I do find it weird she is in your house looking in your pantry. Just tell your BF you\u2019re not paying for name brand stuff, he is.", "NTA\n\nI agree with other post, your title really should deal with food price and buying off brand.  The problem you describe has nothing to do with \"parenting\" and everything to do with budget.  You have done NOTHING but met BF's daughter's needs.  You have a limited income and still do it...Congrats.  BF just wants to make \"baby mom\" happy then he can ask that BM provide the food that she demands be eaten if the \"off brand is not adequate.  There are some on brand that I can't live without, but there are a whole lot more I NEVER would pay extra for because the off brand is the same.  BF needs to back you or come up with another way to not cost the two of you more then you are currently paying to meet 100% of the daughters needs.", "NTA\n\nThis is a budget issue, but really it sounds more like she was waiting to find something she could complain about.

If your boyfriend thinks buying the food will maintain harmony between him and his mothers child, then that is the best decision for the sake of their child's wellbeing. Your bf should definitely be the one to continue paying for it, because his daughter is his financial responsibility. If that has an impact on your over all home budget, maybe the conversation should be around how he can find ways to supplement his income to afford the extra money spent on groceries.

My son did have to take pills at that age, so one of the ways to do that is to crush up the pill and put it in applesauce or pudding and then spoon feed it to them so you know they got it all.
