AITA for telling my brother to get a lawyer and helping him to enforce the pre-nup?\n\nUpdate:  People seem upset about the phrase \"take him to the cleaners.\"  The biggest issue in the marriage was that she diverted many thousands of dollars to her family.  Sometimes she would do it openly, sometimes she would ask him for money for X and give it to her family instead.  My brother claims it was several hundred thousands of dollars, but I don't know for sure.

You doing the right thing.", "I concur. NTA.", "Yes, and  I don't apologize for using that expression.  Reddit is fun partly because people get stuck on side issue, but this is absolutely a side issue.  Any one that knows her would not be offended by the expression and it was a prediction, not an accusation.", "Good point.", "My family told him all of that.  There are no kids by the way.  This was a specific discussion about the divorce process.", "She never used those words when complaining though so I doubt he told her that.   She thought she had him talked into not enforcing the pre-nup is my understanding.", "No, and she had her own lawyer as well.", "Correct.  I don't agree with what my brother did, but thought he was entitled to a lawyer.", "Good point.", "Get a fucking grip. The brother could be in his fifties with a 35 year old girlfriend. Just because he\u2019s a jerk does not mean he\u2019s a perv", "That is a bit unhinged but OK.  The GF is in her mid 40s.", "She basically was saying leave her out of it when she said go to a lawyer and figure it out.", "I was so confused why people are focused on that. It's a really common expression.", "But why did you accuse her to your brother of being that kind of person? That was nasty unless you already thought poorly of her.\n\nedit: And with 20 years of marriage and if it wasn't her fault, why did you encourage him to enforce it? You didn't just \"remind\" him of it then, you actively encouraged him to use it.

I told him that he needed a lawyer to enforce it.  That is not the same thing.  And she was far from blameless in the marriage, I was just trying to keep things simple.", ">But why did you accuse her to your brother of being that kind of person? That was nasty unless you already thought poorly of her.\n\nI mean, if it's true that she wasn't sticking to a prenup agreement that she had signed, it kind of does seem like she was trying to take his money. It might not have been to the extent of \"taking him to the cleaners\" but she was clearly intent on taking what she didn't legally have a claim over. Otherwise, why wouldn't she stick to the prenup?\n\n>And with 20 years of marriage and if it wasn't her fault, why did you encourage him to enforce it? You didn't just \"remind\" him of it then, you actively encouraged him to use it. Ewww.\n\nOf course OP encouraged their brother to enforce the prenup. It's a contract that both spouses signed-it doesn't matter if the divorce wasn't her fault or how many years of marriage it had been, the wife agreed to the terms and now has to follow them. She can fight it if she wants, but it was her decision to agree to the prenup and-barring extenuating situations like being coerced to do so-and being a good wife who did everything right has no bearing in a legal contract.", "It is just an expression in my family, it is not an accusation.  My brother did not take it as an accusation, he agreed that it was a probable course of action that his ex would take.  But if you want to think it was nasty, I accept the judgement.  PS:  She diverted money routinely to her family throughout the marriage, hundreds of thousands of dollars per my brother.  It was the biggest long-term issue in the marriage.   So I think that the phrase \"Taking her to the cleaners\" was 100% accurate and a prediction, not an accusation", "He\u2019s dating an adult it\u2019s a completely acceptable age gap", "Well then, aside from the infidelity, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. She\u2019s well old enough to decide that she\u2019s willing to bang an old man.", "So still human trash, but not a 40 year old predating on a 20 year old. That's better. Reminder though, better than isn't the same as good. You are both still kinda trashy and bad people.", "Noted.", "\"See a lawyer.\"  Should honestly be about the safest thing to say to anyone who asks for legal advice.  Real life is not Reddit after all.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t help your brother get a divorce. Your brother wanted a divorce and you helped him not get screwed.\n\nMake sure he gets a fr agreement with this new woman. Generally 20 year olds don\u2019t get with much older men with a lot of money and bad social skills out of a pure love for the man.", "NTA\n\nWell.\n\nI think your brother is an asshole for having an affair, AND the person is 20 years younger makes me wonder if he\u2019s a creep.\n\nBut recommending a lawyer in a divorce is pretty standard, and I don\u2019t think it makes you an asshole.", "\u201cGet a lawyer\u201d is not helping someone it\u2019s common sense.   But after 20 years together a prenup should be voided especially after your brother cheated on his wife. What a crappy situation.", "NTA but this is why you should have infidelity clauses in prenups", "NTA but your brother is the dumbest rich person I've ever heard of. \"I don't need a lawyer...\"", "NTA \n\nI mean, your brother is definitely an AH, but you're not.  Personally, I think you should distance yourself from both your brother and ex-SIL for a while. You shouldn't be dragged into this mess nor thrown under the bus for giving basic advice.", "NTA but I believe once a cheater always a cheater. Once his mistress becomes his wife he\u2019s gonna get another mistress. Maybe not now but eventually.  Also dating a woman who could be his daughter is kinda gross imho", "NTA yeah of course everyone involved should have a lawyer but your brother sucks. You can say the divorce is because his ex spent money but at the end of the day he has a 20 year younger side piece so he will always be a bad person", "NTA", "Nta at all", "NTA\n\nYou advised him to get legal advice \u2026 to assist him in a legal issue. That\u2019s not a bad thing.", "NTA, even if your brother sounds like a huge one.\n\nI'm of the belief everyone should be entitled to good legal advice in any legal matter. Even people like murderers deserve good legal representation. You were just ensuring that happened.", "Gonna go with NTA\n\nYou\u2019re right, he is entitled to a lawyer. But your brother sounds like a piece of work. A cheater isn\u2019t exactly someone with a great character. And I don\u2019t have sympathy for rich people who lose money.\n\nEdited because OP reveals that the girlfriend is in her 40s so it\u2019s her choice to keep making shitty decisions.", "NTA. She signed the prenup. Everyone grow up, shut up, move on with their lives. Plus, he's your brother, so f her.", "NTA. You just gave him some common sense advice.", "Unless you wrote the prenup she signed and agreed to 20 years ago then no you are NTA.

We don\u2019t know if there was more going on and regardless, they had a prenup in place.", "Your brother is dumping his wife of 20 years for a woman young enough to be his daughter, and you made sure the soon to be ex-wife is left with nothing. Wow. You and your brother...YTA.", "Ooo", "And if ops brother was telling the truth, it sounds like the ex lied on multiple occasions about needing money for something and then giving it to her family instead at the sum of hundreds of thousands of dollars. So in a way she got her money already.", "20 years younger, she is in her mid 40s.  But yes, you are right.", "Yeah, that is why I feel badly about it.", "An interesting thing is that with the prenup and no kids, it only took a few months.  It is already done with and I have no reason to see my SIL.", "Also, usually prenups are set to expire after a certain length of marriage and if not most judges will determine what the spouse is owed even with an existing prenup after more than 10 years of marriage.\n\nAfter 20 years, it's really strange she got absolutely nothing unless he could prove that the wife was doing something financially shady.", "Lol just looking to be angry I see", "What does that matter at all? The facts are she signed a prenup. End of story.", "Why did you make up a whole scenario where there are kids lol, nowhere in the original post were kids mentioned. \n\nYour whole response is actually full of assumptions and misunderstandings, kids were never mentioned and OP never said to take the ex wife to the cleaners. Reread the original post haha", "Yeah, we weren't happy about it.", "Why would you instantly assume he\u2019s a predator? He\u2019s retired, so wouldn\u2019t it stand to reason he\u2019s around 60? Brother seems like an asshole but that doesn\u2019t instantly make him a creep.", "Not her business not does OP approve. She simply told him to lawyer up. The ex-wife had been sending money to his family for the duration of the marriage already. She clearly got her pound of flesh already.", "\"you made sure the soon to be ex-wife is left with nothing\"\n\nYes, I invented a time machine, make the ex wife sign the pre-nup and told the judge to enforce it.  /s   I have mixed feelings about how it turned out, but all I told him was that he needed a lawyer.", "Did you find any other reason why your brother wanted to leave his wife other than trading her in for a newer model? Did he say that his wife was spending too much money?", "I know plenty of women who said they want a civil divorce and just want to take whats theirs and go. Then they meet with the lawyer just once, who tells them how much they can get, and suddenly they want it all.", "Seems like a lot of people are stuck on that phrase. I use that phrase often, such as \u201coh man the freaking lawn service took me to the cleaners.\u201d \n\nRegardless, the situation is legally clear but morally? Lots of gray area. If your SIL treated your brother well throughout their marriage, he\u2019s an asshole. Even if she diverted funds to her family, adultery on his end is also a breach of trust. Hard to determine which is worse, stealing from your spouse or cheating on your spouse? Morally, I\u2019d argue that she is at least entitled to SOME financial compensation for her 20 years with your brother. You could argue that her diverting hundreds of thousands to her family was compensation enough, so we\u2019re back at square one. In the end, the prenup seems ironclad and unless she signed it under duress, she has no legal leg to stand on. \n\nAs for you? In my opinion, NTA. You gave brother the most basic of legal advice. For a successful man like himself, it\u2019s comical he thought he didn\u2019t need a lawyer if she\u2019s threatening to not abide by the prenup.", "See my edit for info about financially shady.", "Doesn\u2019t this sub just love to create baseless assumptions.", "\"How can I make this the man's fault\" -AITA", "Yikes. Scary to think there\u2019s a lawyer out there advising women to sign agreements that disadvantageous. Twenty years of marriage and she is entitled to absolutely zero marital assets? Your brother is the biggest asshole in this scenario. Her lawyer is second.", "So if you don't believe you were in the wrong at all, why did you post here?", "He said that she diverted a couple hundred thousand dollar to his unemployed in-laws over many years and lied about it.  But it might have been part of the marriage agreement, we aren't sure.", "It's in the edit", "This subreddit in particular has some gendered opinions that are...not in line with reality, to say the least", "Because when people in this sub want to be pissed at an OP but realize they can\u2019t mental gymnastics their way into voting Y T A on the actual issue, they find some arbitrary detail to decide is the issue at hand and vote Y T A over that. The number of top comments on this sub that spend 75% of the comment focusing on 5% of the post is wild.", "Whenever there's a relationship with age difference, this sub can't wait to jump into conclusions.", "I don't know that the lawyer advised her to sign it.  They might have said no and she signed it anyway.  I just know that she had a lawyer look at it.", "To be fair his brother seems like an absolute dick who screwed over his wife lol. The ESH comments are just weird tho lol, reminding someone to get a lawyer can hardly be called helping.", "Its an expression everywhere. Zero need to explain."]}
