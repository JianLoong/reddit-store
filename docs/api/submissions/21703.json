It might not have been to the extent of \"taking him to the cleaners\" but she was clearly intent on taking what she didn't legally have a claim over.

You didn't just \"remind\" him of it then, you actively encouraged him to use it. Ewww.\n\nOf course OP encouraged their brother to enforce the prenup. It's a contract that both spouses signed-it doesn't matter if the divorce wasn't her fault or how many years of marriage it had been, the wife agreed to the terms and now has to follow them. She can fight it if she wants, but it was her decision to agree to the prenup and-barring extenuating situations like being coerced to do so-and being a good wife who did everything right has no bearing in a legal contract.", "It is just an expression in my family, it is not an accusation.  My brother did not take it as an accusation, he agreed that it was a probable course of action that his ex would take.  But if you want to think it was nasty, I accept the judgement.  PS:  She diverted money routinely to her family throughout the marriage, hundreds of thousands of dollars per my brother.  It was the biggest long-term issue in the marriage.

But yes, you are right.", "Yeah, that is why I feel badly about it.", "An interesting thing is that with the prenup and no kids, it only took a few months.  It is already done with and I have no reason to see my SIL.", "Also, usually prenups are set to expire after a certain length of marriage and if not most judges will determine what the spouse is owed even with an existing prenup after more than 10 years of marriage.\n\nAfter 20 years, it's really strange she got absolutely nothing unless he could prove that the wife was doing something financially shady.", "Lol just looking to be angry I see", "What does that matter at all? The facts are she signed a prenup.

The ex-wife had been sending money to his family for the duration of the marriage already. She clearly got her pound of flesh already.", "\"you made sure the soon to be ex-wife is left with nothing\"\n\nYes, I invented a time machine, make the ex wife sign the pre-nup and told the judge to enforce it.  /s   I have mixed feelings about how it turned out, but all I told him was that he needed a lawyer.", "Did you find any other reason why your brother wanted to leave his wife other than trading her in for a newer model? Did he say that his wife was spending too much money?", "I know plenty of women who said they want a civil divorce and just want to take whats theirs and go.

I use that phrase often, such as \u201coh man the freaking lawn service took me to the cleaners.\u201d \n\nRegardless, the situation is legally clear but morally? Lots of gray area. If your SIL treated your brother well throughout their marriage, he\u2019s an asshole. Even if she diverted funds to her family, adultery on his end is also a breach of trust. Hard to determine which is worse, stealing from your spouse or cheating on your spouse? Morally, I\u2019d argue that she is at least entitled to SOME financial compensation for her 20 years with your brother. You could argue that her diverting hundreds of thousands to her family was compensation enough, so we\u2019re back at square one. In the end, the prenup seems ironclad and unless she signed it under duress, she has no legal leg to stand on. \n\nAs for you? In my opinion, NTA. You gave brother the most basic of legal advice.

They might have said no and she signed it anyway.  I just know that she had a lawyer look at it.", "To be fair his brother seems like an absolute dick who screwed over his wife lol.

She is out of your life.", "I mean, the brother might be an asshole for the divorce in the first place but 'Get a lawyer to handle your legal proceedings' is standard advice.\n\nEven amicable divorces are emotionally fraught.

It's his ex's fault if him getting his shit together dumpstered her whole case.\n\nAlso, if she didn't want the pre-nup she shouldn't have signed it. A prenup can be unfair in its writing, but at the end of the day she wasn't forced by any real measure other than personal desire to sign it.

I don't blame her to be honest.", "He wasn't paying her to be with him. She doesn't need back pay. Especially since they don't have children to mutually support. That wouldn't be marriage, it'd be prostitution. Nothing wrong with that, just a very different situation.", "Why do ppl have to add their two cents. He is asking a question. Everyone is entitled to a lawyer.", "Guess stay at home wife isnt a good life project", "I don;t think that he would listen to me and I am trying to stay out of it from now on.", "Does this obligate us to say maybe the new woman is in the family way?", "I mean, let's not split hairs here, this is absolutely the man's fault, but that doesn't make op the asshole for telling his brother to get a lawyer", "Cause sometimes the wife gives up her job because the husband makes enough. Instead she renders services in childcare or housework. Once you leave a lot of career tracks it is exceptionally hard to renter.", "I agree unless one partner made career sacrifices that benefit the other\u2026 like moving far away for one partners career, or a partner working less or quitting altogether to do more around the house or take care of the kids.", "She agreed to a prenup 20 years ago. Conditions/people change over 20 years. You seem to believe a \"gotcha\" situation is fine -- like she was dumb to agree 20 years ago, so she deserves it when he leaves her for someone else?\n\nedit: Do you still make the same type of decisions you made when you were a lot younger and more naive about the world? A lot of us learn over 20 years.", "What a play on words: You didn't encourage it, you just told him he needed a lawyer to enforce it after he told you they had discussed it! Your own AITA uses the expression \"helped him.\"\n\nAnd now you edit it to add that she'd been \"diverting\" money to her family -- which your brother knew about through the years. How could she do that without joint accounts? And if they did have joint accounts, how could she get nothing?\n\nEdit: Found another comment where you say she asked him for money that she then gave her family but he SOMETIMES didn't know it was for them. -- So they didn't have joint accounts and she had to ask him for money? He controlled the finances, then?  You also indicate that you aren't sure who is telling the truth (\" might have been part of the marriage contract. We aren't sure.\") so it sounds like your brother isn't the greatest. He sounds increasingly like an AH.", "Just as old fashioned marriage should be.", "People here have too much change and are always offering their 2 cents to everyone regardless of what the latter asked for.", "Was she a stay at home wife? Maybe I'm missing it - I don't see it. But regardless, if she was instrumental to him creating his wealth by supporting him financially or even just being a partner to him, it seems like the kind thing to do would be to give her some kind of settlement. Especially since his infidelity is the reason they broke up.", "This guy might be an a hole for leaving his wife. But I don\u2019t see a problem with a 60s male adult dating a 40s female adult.", "She is in her mid 40s, not sure how likely that would be.", "I mean it is, but you know every time the genders are flipped and someone cheats people invent a whole scenario about abuse and battered spouses. Maybe the brother had a legitimate reason to be cheating. We don't know, and nobody just cheats for any reason. Maybe the wife deserved it for some reason, it seems suspicious to assume so much innocence on her part and again I'm kidding, but it was be awful if people on here with a gender bias suggested this about male victims of infidelity.", ">You are both still kinda trashy and bad people.\n\nTrashy and bad for saying \"Hey if you're getting divorced you should look into a lawyer?\"", "The wife isn't so innocent either, giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to her family without ops brothers knowledge.", "I accept your judgement but I don't find you credible beyond that,  \"To the cleaners\" is NOT a derogatory phrase, expecting a brother to know every detail of a marriage is not credible (I am his brother, not his accountant) and you seem to have an axe to grind.  Have a good weekend, thank you for your judgement.", "Depends if she got a lawyer or not to handle the divorce situation", "yeah people forget how much labor is done by a spouse to LET someone run a tech start up \u2014 it also kinda seems like he really controlled their finances??? and she just wanted to help her family?? honestly i just don\u2019t really trust tech start up guys, especially ones that immediately go for a younger partner", "Check where OP says it might have been in the marriage contract. OP's use of information tends to be a moving target.", "I think you\u2019re confusing that with a different post yesterday.", "She had a lawyer for both the divorce and the pre-nup.", "Nah, this is somthing people concot to justify how women are entitled to money they did nothing for.sitting at home while your partner works is not challenging.", "Nope, op stated it on this post.", "It's in the edit", "Check the OP again", "He does claim that happened.", "oh boy"]}
