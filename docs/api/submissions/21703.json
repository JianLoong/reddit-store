He said his wife was not sticking to the agreement, after a bit of a discussion he meant that they had a pre-nup.  I told him that he needed to talk to his lawyer about that and it turned out he did not have a lawyer.  He said he was trying to save money and that he didn't need a lawyer because of the agreement.  I told him that he was wealthy, of course he needed a lawyer and that his wife would try to take him to the cleaners without one.\n\nHe got a lawyer and told his ex that I recommended it.

AITA for telling my brother to get a lawyer and helping him to enforce the pre-nup?\n\nUpdate:  People seem upset about the phrase \"take him to the cleaners.\"  The biggest issue in the marriage was that she diverted many thousands of dollars to her family.  Sometimes she would do it openly, sometimes she would ask him for money for X and give it to her family instead.  My brother claims it was several hundred thousands of dollars, but I don't know for sure.  But I think that the phrase was appropriate in the circumstances, it was a likely outcome.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1688848423, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14uem2d/aita_for_helping_my_brother_divorce_his_wife_for/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was a specific discussion about the divorce process.", "She never used those words when complaining though so I doubt he told her that.

I don't agree with what my brother did, but thought he was entitled to a lawyer.", "Good point.", "Get a fucking grip. The brother could be in his fifties with a 35 year old girlfriend. Just because he\u2019s a jerk does not mean he\u2019s a perv", "That is a bit unhinged but OK.  The GF is in her mid 40s.", "She basically was saying leave her out of it when she said go to a lawyer and figure it out.", "I was so confused why people are focused on that. It's a really common expression.", "But why did you accuse her to your brother of being that kind of person? That was nasty unless you already thought poorly of her.\n\nedit: And with 20 years of marriage and if it wasn't her fault, why did you encourage him to enforce it?

I told him that he needed a lawyer to enforce it.  That is not the same thing.  And she was far from blameless in the marriage, I was just trying to keep things simple.", ">But why did you accuse her to your brother of being that kind of person? That was nasty unless you already thought poorly of her.\n\nI mean, if it's true that she wasn't sticking to a prenup agreement that she had signed, it kind of does seem like she was trying to take his money. It might not have been to the extent of \"taking him to the cleaners\" but she was clearly intent on taking what she didn't legally have a claim over. Otherwise, why wouldn't she stick to the prenup?\n\n>And with 20 years of marriage and if it wasn't her fault, why did you encourage him to enforce it? You didn't just \"remind\" him of it then, you actively encouraged him to use it. Ewww.\n\nOf course OP encouraged their brother to enforce the prenup. It's a contract that both spouses signed-it doesn't matter if the divorce wasn't her fault or how many years of marriage it had been, the wife agreed to the terms and now has to follow them. She can fight it if she wants, but it was her decision to agree to the prenup and-barring extenuating situations like being coerced to do so-and being a good wife who did everything right has no bearing in a legal contract.", "It is just an expression in my family, it is not an accusation.  My brother did not take it as an accusation, he agreed that it was a probable course of action that his ex would take.  But if you want to think it was nasty, I accept the judgement.  PS:  She diverted money routinely to her family throughout the marriage, hundreds of thousands of dollars per my brother.  It was the biggest long-term issue in the marriage.   So I think that the phrase \"Taking her to the cleaners\" was 100% accurate and a prediction, not an accusation", "He\u2019s dating an adult it\u2019s a completely acceptable age gap", "Well then, aside from the infidelity, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. She\u2019s well old enough to decide that she\u2019s willing to bang an old man.", "So still human trash, but not a 40 year old predating on a 20 year old. That's better. Reminder though, better than isn't the same as good. You are both still kinda trashy and bad people.", "Noted."]}
