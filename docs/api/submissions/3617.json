If she's regularly cleaning the office, then we don't have a situation where the following sentences are true:\n\n*\"I have asked her multiple times to please leave my room alone. I clean it myself. I take my dishes to the kitchen and either wash them or place them in the dishwasher. I take out my own trash. When I play with my kids in my office I clean up after all of us. When my wife joins me in my office for video games I clean up afterwards. There is quite literally no reason for her to do anything in there when I am not in it. I do not have a lock on my door but I do have my laptop password protected.\"*\n\nSo I guess if she's regularly cleaning the office, she doesn't know he doesn't want her in there. I'd want more facts. What does the regular cleaning look like? How long has she been cleaning? What does that cleaning entail? How does he react to the fact that she cleans? Why didn't she check the laptop before closing it? Why did she close it at all? \n\nAt the end of the day, though, she still broke the laptop. I'd *probably* come down on the side of her paying it.

If its not materially impactful to your overall finances to just...absorb this into the overall budget anyways, can you just do that and let it go?

It was just weird to me that there their space is completely off limits.", "You end up with situations like these. Not because of malice but because of accidents. They're normal, but much more probable if you don't know your way around stuff.", "It\u2019s essentially how damages are measured in tort cases, so idk.", "I\u2019m just grateful I\u2019m not in a relationship where my SO effectively bans me (or even thinks he has the authority to ban me) from an entire room. (And yes, I know OP has said \u201cshe\u2019s not banned from the room!!!11\u201d But he was backtracking on his original post in which he said she wasn\u2019t supposed to be in the room.)", "So he would pay for 100% of it?", "Sounds awesome.  I am getting the Hulk Buster soon.", "If it was an accident, yeah. I\u2019m trying to think of the most expensive thing I own and if my partner broke it by accident, yeah, it would just be like \u201coh well things break.\u201d\n\nThere would absolutely be a conversation about how we will handle paying for the fix or replacement. I would expect my partner to want to contribute, but I\u2019d also want to figure out the best way so that the any suffering is shared more or less equally.", "The total cost was $250. I was going to have a guy at work do it for me. Until I decided replacing it was a better option.", "It's an analogy.", "She has a harp in her room. It is worth about $15,000.  If I go into her hobby room for no reason other than to do something nice that she has told me on many occasions not to do and I trip and damage the harp should she pay to repair it?", "So she gets to break his things without any consequences? That's not fair either if they're partners.", "Thanks! That\u2019s absolutely crazy that they both stored them the freezer and then left them there when they moved. I can\u2019t imagine being the person who found them.", "That\u2019s so wild.", "It's allowed, but this whole thread is insane strawmen, all implying shitty things about OP.  So I figured I'd point that out.", "I think that\u2019s just part of married life, though. The more people you have together under one roof, the more likely things will get broken.\n\nObviously people should try to respect each other\u2019s things and space, but that only goes so far under a shared roof all day for years. In my opinion, anyway.", "Well good thing we are talking about a tort case. But even if we were, you still aren\u2019t making the point you think you are. Any element of reasonableness would be looked at under the specific circumstances. Here, not only did OP warn his partner about his office, my guess is the partner was highly aware of OP\u2019s hobbies and figures.", "I think even in tort cases, unless OPs wife has eyes which are near-blindness, she would be expected to see the lego pieces on the laptop and reasonably know that closing the laptop on those pieces would damage them.", "Honestly that makes sense, for the most part. I have hobbies and work stuff here that I don\u2019t expect my partner to touch, tidy or clean, and he doesn\u2019t (because, why would he?)\n\nBut I don\u2019t know how far that extends and she may not, either. He wouldn\u2019t mess with my work lap, but if he were vacuuming, for example, he might pick up the cords of my work laptop in my office to vacuum underneath them. \n\nIf he accidentally hooked the cord with the vacuum it would suck but I\u2019d consider an accident, not something that he broke that he shouldn\u2019t have been messing with.", "Yeah he would and he wouldn't have a problem with that. Our marriage is a partnership and the money he earns is our money.", "So what is inherently unfair about how we decided to handle it?", "And, this is your real life, and you are damaging your marriage and your wife\u2019s feelings toward you.  \n\nDo I need to explain?", "the point is y\u2019all have plenty of money so why squabble over a $250 mistake. so yea you are punishing her.", "consequences?? this is just not how my marriage works. I think everyone has lost their minds.", "Yeah, I want to know the thought process here... Did they not think the remains would be discovered? Or the landlord would have their names? Not to be callous, but the remains would probably all fit in a black trash bag.", "> I think that\u2019s just part of married life, though.\n\nSometimes your spouse just ignores your polite requests not to fuck with your space, and your stuff gets broken?", "She closed my laptop on my little plastic people who were standing on my keyboard area.", "And if he broke your Xbox you would then payn100% of the costs out of your own money right?", "> Hard to say without knowing their finances.\n\nThis is answered in the OP:\n\n> This will in no way affect our budget for anything other than our own personal side projects and hobbies.", "In theory, nothing. In practice, it doesn\u2019t sound like your wife was an active participant in coming to this agreement.", "So where do you think the money should come from?", "I understand, but it was still an accident. Unless you think she did it on purpose?", "Fair enough! In some way this may come down to the fact that I\u2019m not materialistic and I don\u2019t really care about money. As long as I can pay my bills, take my cat to the vet, and save, I\u2019m happy. \n\nAnd also, because my partner is an adult student and reliant on me at the moment, I consider pretty much everything to be \u201chousehold.\u201d\n\nSo, I do find OP\u2019s financial approach with his financially dependent wife to be too transactional. I do however agree that she bears financial responsibility of breaking the laptop - I just think her responsibility is to the household, not to her husband.", "It would come out of our shared money no matter who broke who's.", "I think whether I\u2019d be the AH or not really depends on the details of how it went down. \n\nLike I know for sure my partner would want to contribute to rectifying for the situation, and I think OP\u2019s wife is an AH for not offering immediately.\n\nWhat settled me on ESH isn\u2019t so much the expectation of repayment but the whole \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed in my room except when you are but since you\u2019re kinda not if you broke something doing chores, it\u2018s all on you\u201d and also taking away her entire month of discretionary spending. \n\nThey have credit cards and as you pointed out, are likely financially comfortably. I don\u2019t see why this couldn\u2019t have been spread out.", "I meant more like, do they have a joint account for household expenses? Emergencies? How do they manage larger, unexpected expenses?", "See, for one thing, that is the wrong question. \nInstead of keeping score, you should be working together to make your marriage stronger. By taking away her money, you are punishing her and causing resentment, and making her feel like a child.\nIt\u2019s like you are acting like the Pharisee by adhering exactly to the letter of the law;!while a loving marriage calls for more of a Jesus approach\u2014I forgive you, go in peace and sin no more type of situation.\nA marriage usually dies a death of a thousand small cuts, not usually one knock-out blow. Your insistence on punishing her is a metaphorical cut, that she will remember long after the computer is gone.\nIf I were you, I would say, \u201chey, you know what? Here\u2019s the $250 so that you can do some fun things with your mom and friends. It\u2019s Christmas .\u201d and she will say \u201c where is the money coming from for the computer?\u201d And I would say, \u201cyou know, we have the money elsewhere. I want you to have a good month because I love you and I want you to be happy.\u201d And she would be so happy and the two would not be fighting tonight, and she will remember this forever and she will probably tell this story at your Celebration of Life, and all of your friends and family will be impressed.\nBut that is just me\u2014do what you want. If you need to be right above all else, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.", "I do not think it was on purpose.  But, for example, she has a big honking harp in her room.  If I go in there to change a lightbulb I make sure she is there to help with the ladder because I do not want to damage the harp. Or to be responsible for fixing it.", "I don't know that it's materialistic to want your things to be well taken care of. (Materialistic is *needing* the latest $4,000 laptop every year.) I also see having separate budgets as freeing, not transactional. And, perhaps ironically, the wife could have done best by the household by staying away from her husband's office, particularly when she was told to stay out of her husband's office. Reasonable people can disagree.", "So it should come out of the money for our retirement, kids education, groceries, mortgage payments, or car payments?", "Sounds like a healthier arrangement.", "The facts we have on her access to his office are these: \n\n*\"I have asked her multiple times to please leave my room alone. I clean it myself. I take my dishes to the kitchen and either wash them or place them in the dishwasher. I take out my own trash. When I play with my kids in my office I clean up after all of us. When my wife joins me in my office for video games I clean up afterwards. There is quite literally no reason for her to do anything in there when I am not in it. I do not have a lock on my door but I do have my laptop password protected.\"*\n\nDo we have any facts to suggest that the wife requested to spread out the payments and that OP rejected that request? If those were the facts, we could consider an everyone sucks here judgment. But I *still* don't know that I'd get there based on the facts. We all learn in kindergarten not to touch things that aren't ours. The wife had no business touching the laptop or being in his office. \n\nThis is as open and shut as it gets for me.", "If I had to pay for her accident then I would be pissed. But for some reason you think those thousand cuts do not affect me?"]}
