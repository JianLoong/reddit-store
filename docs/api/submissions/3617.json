If it were me (my partner, broke student, broke my laptop by accident while cleaning,) I\u2019d just pay for it out of household savings or put it on my credit card like anything else we need for the home, and then pay off my credit card as normal. \n\nHe\u2019d probably offer me some money as well, and I\u2019d probably tell him to give me what he wants from his next paycheque (he works PT retail so they aren\u2019t big paycheques). Knowing it\u2019s December, I\u2019d probably also say he can give it to me later after Christmas, or he can spread it out.\n\nIf OP and his wife don\u2019t have any savings or credit cards, I\u2019d probably have gone with the cheaper option of fixing the screen and split it 50/50 with my partner so that neither of us was without any spending money that month.", "There\u2019s so many other details I wish I knew.

Wife is doing a big dusting, does his desk too which involves lifting items to dust underneath, and accidentally slams down the lid into the figurines.\n\nOP\u2019s inconsistent comments about what his wife is allowed to do in there isn\u2019t helping all that much, either. In a recent comment, he said that he didn\u2019t want her to rearrange his furniture or put stuff away because she messily put away some of his files in the past. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d automatically assume that means \u201cno cleaning of any sort.\u201d  \n\nQuestion for you - if everything else was the same but OP\u2019s wife regularly cleaned his office, and OP was fine with that, would you feel the same?", "Sorry to hear that- maybe practice?", "We can assume OP are sufficiently well\u2013to\u2013do because (i) his wife doesn't need to work outside the home, (ii) they live in a home where each have their own space despite having kids (plural), and (iii) the wife appears to have a healthy amount of fun money every month. That tells me that they have a house that has at least three bedrooms (probably four) and at least two extra rooms (in addition to a living room and a dining room/kitchen) so that OP and wife can have their own space. \n\nThe point, though, remains \"who should pay.\" It's wonderful that you'd extend grace to your partner. (And it sounds like you're the breadwinner in the relationship.) But would you be an asshole if you expected your partner to replace the laptop, particularly if he broke it doing something you expressly told him not to do? My vote is \"no,\" you wouldn't.", "If she's regularly cleaning it, then we're dealing with a night\u2013and\u2013day difference in the fact pattern. (No, I don't place stock in what people add in the comments; it's too hard to find that information.) If she's regularly cleaning the office, then we don't have a situation where the following sentences are true:\n\n*\"I have asked her multiple times to please leave my room alone. I clean it myself. I take my dishes to the kitchen and either wash them or place them in the dishwasher. I take out my own trash. When I play with my kids in my office I clean up after all of us. When my wife joins me in my office for video games I clean up afterwards. There is quite literally no reason for her to do anything in there when I am not in it. I do not have a lock on my door but I do have my laptop password protected.\"*\n\nSo I guess if she's regularly cleaning the office, she doesn't know he doesn't want her in there. I'd want more facts. What does the regular cleaning look like? How long has she been cleaning? What does that cleaning entail? How does he react to the fact that she cleans? Why didn't she check the laptop before closing it? Why did she close it at all? \n\nAt the end of the day, though, she still broke the laptop. I'd *probably* come down on the side of her paying it. But I'd really want to know the facts. One of the reasons I like this particular post is that we have a lot of facts and can make some intelligent commentary."]}
