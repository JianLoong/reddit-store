If she's regularly cleaning the office, then we don't have a situation where the following sentences are true:\n\n*\"I have asked her multiple times to please leave my room alone. I clean it myself. I take my dishes to the kitchen and either wash them or place them in the dishwasher. I take out my own trash. When I play with my kids in my office I clean up after all of us. When my wife joins me in my office for video games I clean up afterwards. There is quite literally no reason for her to do anything in there when I am not in it. I do not have a lock on my door but I do have my laptop password protected.\"*\n\nSo I guess if she's regularly cleaning the office, she doesn't know he doesn't want her in there. I'd want more facts. What does the regular cleaning look like? How long has she been cleaning? What does that cleaning entail? How does he react to the fact that she cleans? Why didn't she check the laptop before closing it? Why did she close it at all? \n\nAt the end of the day, though, she still broke the laptop. I'd *probably* come down on the side of her paying it.

If its not materially impactful to your overall finances to just...absorb this into the overall budget anyways, can you just do that and let it go?

It just feels somewhat petty to pull what sounds like a pretty material portion of her fun money if you don't have to without causing actual financial damage. \n\nAnother thought is that...its the holidays - would you each be open to the idea of her just getting $50/mo less in spending money each month from Jan-May?

He never bought a new laptop, he chose to fix the broken one instead. He was going to take only $100 less than what he took from HIS fun money, he'd still pay for an accident that, while not done in malice, still had consequences. Even if they'd compromised to have it discounted from her fun money in installments after the holidays, it would still mean he:  \n1) Would have to go without a laptop for a while or  \n2) Would still have to pay, right before the holidays.\n\nIs it fair he pay for it, all $250, to fix his laptop, and still forgo buying his LEGO (in case you don't know, it is expensive and $100 more makes all the difference), while she still is able to use her fun money, go to her SPA, whatever she wanted?\n\nHe didn't sound (at least not to me) like he wanted to teach her a lesson. It sounded like he felt hurt that a space he cared about had been breached, possessions he cared about had been damaged, plans he had made with his money - that involved quality time with his children, on top of it - had been ruined.\n\nHad it been the other way around, and his wife's safe space, trust, boundaries, hobbies and money were the ones affected, would you still vouch for the \"let it go and move on\" approach?", "I know this marriage sounds like my nightmare.

These being the \"dots\" that make up the resolution. eg. a full HD screen has 1920 pixels across and 1080 pixels down. It is possible for them to break individually and its not uncommon to see LCD screens with \"dead pixels,\" which just look like black dots on the display. If you break a lot, it might look like a black smudge or dirty mark.\n\nIt was very common on matte LCD displays that didn't have a glass front. These were so soft that you could gently poke your finger against the screen and it would distort the image. I had loads in my first job and I'd constantly scream at staff for poking their fingers on the screen when they wanted to point at something. Eventually the pixels would break and the screen would have spots all over it and need replacing.\n\nIt generally requires a little more force on modern screens, but even with a glass panel, its not too hard to make the LCD break.", "Touchscreens are obviously made to be hardier because they expect you to touch them. You wouldn't want to put excess pressure on one, though, such as closing the lid on a hard object.

If my husband and I had something like this happened, we have 100% joined accounts but I would still expect whichever of us did this to actively not spend as much that month.

I'm definitely going to keep tabs on this case now. If any parent of the infants have a record, it shouldn't be too difficult to find out who they are.
