You have a good reason why you need to spend your majority effort on someone else. The people you've chosen to help need you and they don't have other options.\n\n3. It's normal to spend most of your effort on your children and grandchildren, not as normal to curtail your life for a sibling.\n\n4. Your brother has other options as he can access facility care due to your mother's work history. This is also a more sustainable option, because if you took over your brother's care, you would burn out just as your mom has burned out. \n\nI think it is a bit callous that your mother expects you to let your tiny grandchild be left in the lurch so that she can take advantage of your early retirement to offload her caregiving responsibilities onto you. \n\nGoing back to the big picture, that your family as a whole simply has too much caregiving needs for the amount of caregivers you have available, it sounds like your brother's care is what CAN be outsourced. It doesn't mean you should all just dump him in a home and forget about him, but it sounds like it would be a lot more sustainable, and the most care needs would be met, for him to be placed in a facility where you could visit him on a regular basis, than for you to become his fulltime caregiver.\n\nSorry your brother's future was so impacted at such a young age.
