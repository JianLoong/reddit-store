Mom can go live elsewhere if she doesn't like what's happening under YOUR roof. I hope she's not on the lease.", "NTA. Just to recap, almost no one (including your own mother) accepts you being gay. Your family that does not accept you being gay wants your mother to move in with you. Your family that does not accept you being gay is forcing you to live with your mother. Your grandmother, who doesn't accept you being gay, is guilt-tripping you to make changes to your life to make your mother, who also doesn't support you being gay, more comfortable in your home.\n\nI hope you see the direction I'm going in.\n\nYou cannot be yourself, love who you want, etc. if your mother lives with you. If you have a boyfriend over, in your own home, you should be able to sit in the open together; you should not have to confine yourselves to your bedroom for fear that your mother would be uncomfortable. Down the line, if you both mutually decided to move in together, this will become a problem; this is inevitable.\n\nYour mother's comfort level is irrelevant because that is your house; she insisted upon living with you, so she can remove herself from the situation. Your mother and you lived with your grandmother prior to this, so your mother can move back in with your grandmother. Your grandmother inserting herself in the situation is unnecessary, too.\n\nYou are NTA and you have done nothing wrong IMO. It feels like your family is trying to prevent you from dating men, and that's wrong.", "NTA.  The AH move was the entire family strong-arming you to let you mom live with you.   And then expecting that (since mom is there) you have no right to a normal social life.  You played this correctly.  If mom doesn't like boyfriend, then MOM has to go.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is an adult woman who needs to live her own life. That includes renting her own place & paying her own bills. \n\nUnfortunately, a LOT of cultures have us (adult children) think it\u2019s our responsibility to let our parent live with us. Hello! I\u2019m one of those people who was raised to believe it was my job as the daughter to let my mom live with us (me & my husband). She did so for over 10 years which resulted in her meddling in our marriage, our raising of kids, & created such a toxic environment in my family that resulted in my kids having an unhealthy childhood because everyone was walking on eggshells to please her & make her happy otherwise everyone else was made more miserable.\n\nYou\u2019re an adult male, your sexuality honestly is a moot point because you could be straight with a girlfriend & she\u2019d have issue with it as well. Time for mom to leave & for you to learn how to have a health adulthood & healthy relationships with others. If that means going NC with family then do so. Trust me, don\u2019t waste your youth trying to please them. They\u2019ll always find fault in everything you do.", "NTA.  Is she on the lease?

She is an adult who can do the same--without interfering in yours.", "NTA - I wanna say it's time for the bird to leave the nest, but in this weird ass case it needs to be applied to your mother.\n\nEdit: this isn't really a question is it? I mean it's blatantly obvious that you shouldn't put up with homophobic shit like this, and family are no exception. If anything they're even less of an exception.", "NTA.

I guess that she had Sex in the house when you were just a child, so she isn't the one to complain ;)", "So you left home to live your life as you want and your mother decided to invade that privacy by forcing you to accept her as your roommate in YOUR rental home.  I hope you are getting rent money from her.  Did you do something wrong?  Yeah, you did.  You let your mother move in even though you wanted to live alone.  Other than that, live your life and tell your mother to butt out or move out.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like an awful freeloader. It's not like she's elderly and needing help.", "Lol no you\u2019re NTA and your mom needs to understand that at 20 you need to be prioritizing a lot more in your life then your mom. \n\nI think mom moving out is a really good idea", "NTA", "NTA.

I would think at 20 years old your mom would be happy that you are becoming an autonomous adult who is no longer dependent on her. Is she elderly and need care?

Your mom is 1000% an AH!\n\nHere\u2019s the deal doll, first, at this point in your life you should be your own first priority (if that includes sex, then good for you).  Second, you do not owe your mom ANYTHING! I despise parents who pull the \u201cI gave you life/everything\u201d card. Feeding, educating, housing, (hopefully) loving a child that you brought into this world doesn\u2019t entitle you to anything. Last, your family\u2019s acceptance (or lack thereof) of you being your true self is a reflection of them, not you! If they have an issue with who you love, that\u2019s their issue, not yours. \n\nMy advice would be to ask your mom to move out. Tell her that it\u2019s nothing against her (even if it\u2019s a lie) because you have things to work through and you need to be alone to work through them\u2026hopefully she moves out, and then change the locks. Or a less manipulative way would be to ask her to move out and let her know she\u2019s not allowed back until you both go to therapy. And  I know therapy gets tossed out a lot, but your mom absolutely needs to because she\u2019s codependent, manipulative, or struggling with your sexuality (even though she shouldn\u2019t). And you do because at the very least you seem incapable of setting boundaries and saying no. \n\nJust know doll there is at least one person in this world who loves you for who you are.

Don't hide yourself because others don't accept you. You didn't ask her to be there, and you're not asking her to stay. You're saying this is me, and this is my home.

This is a hard situation emotionally, but if I were in your shoes, I would kick mom out, be your wonderful gay self, surround yourself with people who love you for who you are, and go NC with my family (except for the 3 supportive cousins).

You need to get your mother out of there.", "This is a very good comment.\n\n>so your mother can move back in with your grandmother\n\nHowever, I suspect that OP's mother cannot move back within with grandma; that the entire point of his family moving mum into OP's place was because grandma doesn't want her anymore.  It's very likely OP is being set up to take care of Mum for the rest of his life and just doesn't realise it yet.", "Ty. What do you make of his mom voicing her discomfort next-day to her grandmother, though? It seems like she's reporting back to her. It's so weird to me to have a mom snitch on her son to her own mom (his grandmother). That's the piece that makes me believe his mom moved in with an ulterior motive since communication between his mom and his grandmother seem good.", "I don't think there is a conflict between them i.e. Grandma wanted Mum to move out; Mum wanted to move out and here is OP with a house for Mum to move into.  There is no reason for Mum and Grandma to be in conflict especially given, I think they are two nasty peas in a pod, in that they both have the same opinion of OP and they are actively looking for ways to critise him.\n\nMum complains to Grandma \"Look at this awful thing my awful son did to me\", Grandma re-enforces Mum \"Yes your awful son is being awful to you.\" and they both get to abuse OP.\n\nAs for who is the lead here it's impossible to know without knowing the people.  It could be Grandma; it could be Mum.\n\nETA: Don't assume just because Grandma was the one doing the talking that she is main villain.  Some people are very good at getting others to do their dirty work for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It's so weird to me to have a mom snitch on her son to her own mom (his grandmother).\n\nMay this always be true for you."]}
