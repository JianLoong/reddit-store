You SHOULD be prioritizing sex over your mother.", "You moved out & your family forced her on you. They sound awful & you should live your life as you are meant to. NTA", "NTA. Standing up against this kind of homophobic, entitled, and frankly abusive behavior is the only way to make it stop for all of us. Thank you for standing up.", "NTA \u2014 you're also not prioritizing sex over your mom. You're prioritizing your autonomy over your mom's hangups and creating boundaries.", "NTA. Mom can go live elsewhere if she doesn't like what's happening under YOUR roof. I hope she's not on the lease.", "NTA. Just to recap, almost no one (including your own mother) accepts you being gay. Your family that does not accept you being gay wants your mother to move in with you. Your family that does not accept you being gay is forcing you to live with your mother. Your grandmother, who doesn't accept you being gay, is guilt-tripping you to make changes to your life to make your mother, who also doesn't support you being gay, more comfortable in your home.\n\nI hope you see the direction I'm going in.\n\nYou cannot be yourself, love who you want, etc. if your mother lives with you. If you have a boyfriend over, in your own home, you should be able to sit in the open together; you should not have to confine yourselves to your bedroom for fear that your mother would be uncomfortable. Down the line, if you both mutually decided to move in together, this will become a problem; this is inevitable.\n\nYour mother's comfort level is irrelevant because that is your house; she insisted upon living with you, so she can remove herself from the situation. Your mother and you lived with your grandmother prior to this, so your mother can move back in with your grandmother. Your grandmother inserting herself in the situation is unnecessary, too.\n\nYou are NTA and you have done nothing wrong IMO. It feels like your family is trying to prevent you from dating men, and that's wrong.", "NTA.  The AH move was the entire family strong-arming you to let you mom live with you.   And then expecting that (since mom is there) you have no right to a normal social life.  You played this correctly.  If mom doesn't like boyfriend, then MOM has to go.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is an adult woman who needs to live her own life. That includes renting her own place & paying her own bills. \n\nUnfortunately, a LOT of cultures have us (adult children) think it\u2019s our responsibility to let our parent live with us. Hello! I\u2019m one of those people who was raised to believe it was my job as the daughter to let my mom live with us (me & my husband). She did so for over 10 years which resulted in her meddling in our marriage, our raising of kids, & created such a toxic environment in my family that resulted in my kids having an unhealthy childhood because everyone was walking on eggshells to please her & make her happy otherwise everyone else was made more miserable.\n\nYou\u2019re an adult male, your sexuality honestly is a moot point because you could be straight with a girlfriend & she\u2019d have issue with it as well. Time for mom to leave & for you to learn how to have a health adulthood & healthy relationships with others. If that means going NC with family then do so. Trust me, don\u2019t waste your youth trying to please them. They\u2019ll always find fault in everything you do.", "NTA.  Is she on the lease?  If she's not, and you can afford all the bills without her help (assuming she's even helping in the first place), then I would not longer make her leaving a suggestion.", "NTA outdated and bad opinions need to stay where they belong, in the past. If she doesn't like it she can move out and honestly I would just go NC with the people who think like this, including your mother. You don't need this hate or drama in your life.", "NTA, and if you don\u2019t receive any kind of financial assistance from your family I suggest you tell your mother she needs to find alternative living arrangements.", "Nta you\u2019re mom could gtfo. Never let anyone pressure you into allowing someone into your living space. You\u2019re a grown ass man.", "NTA. It's 2023  and we aren't dealing with homophobes anymore. It's definitely time to leave your mother behind. She can lease her own place. And any family members who whine can feel free to take her in. Live your life your way!", "NTA, you're prioritizing your life and needs over hers, and that's why they're all in a huff. You have a right to live your life the way you want. She is an adult who can do the same--without interfering in yours.", "NTA - I wanna say it's time for the bird to leave the nest, but in this weird ass case it needs to be applied to your mother.\n\nEdit: this isn't really a question is it? I mean it's blatantly obvious that you shouldn't put up with homophobic shit like this, and family are no exception. If anything they're even less of an exception.", "NTA. Your relatives are toxic.", "NTA, you are an adult. So is your mother. I guess that she had Sex in the house when you were just a child, so she isn't the one to complain ;)", "So you left home to live your life as you want and your mother decided to invade that privacy by forcing you to accept her as your roommate in YOUR rental home.  I hope you are getting rent money from her.  Did you do something wrong?  Yeah, you did.  You let your mother move in even though you wanted to live alone.  Other than that, live your life and tell your mother to butt out or move out.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like an awful freeloader. It's not like she's elderly and needing help.", "Lol no you\u2019re NTA and your mom needs to understand that at 20 you need to be prioritizing a lot more in your life then your mom. \n\nI think mom moving out is a really good idea", "NTA", "NTA. It's your life, do what makes you happy. It was already very nice of you to let her live with you.", "NTA.\n\nBurning bridges with your fam doesn't sound like much of a loss so don't feel the slightest bit guilty about kicking her ass to the curb. If the rest of the fam care so much for her they can have her.", "NTA. \n\nYour family is manipulating you. You are not forced to do anything, although it feels like you are. You are not forced to keep relationships with those people just because they\u2019re blood. Love who you love, and cut out the people who don\u2019t embrace you fully. \n\nStay safe and good luck \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.\n\nKick her out. \nGo low contact/no contact.\nLife is too short for homophobic family.", "This could be an excellent opportunity for your mother to move out. \n\nShe should not be living with you. You should not be buying food for her. She is an adult. She is responsible for herself. \n\n\u201cFam, Mom needs to move out [to grandmother\u2019s, on her own] so that she has time and space to process her feelings about me and my relationships. She won\u2019t be comfortable staying in my home.\u201d", "NTA but why are you still in touch with homophobic relatives? You can\u2019t really complain if you\u2019re still choosing to be in contact with them", "Why does your family insist on your mother living with you? I would think at 20 years old your mom would be happy that you are becoming an autonomous adult who is no longer dependent on her. Is she elderly and need care? This is just bizarre, plus she is bigoted and that is not going to be helpful for you as a newly out person. You should be able to have space to explore your independence at that age.
