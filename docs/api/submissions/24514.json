This morning we were hanging out in the living room and our 3 year old was acting crazy, jumping around my lap and the couch, and she fell off. I caught her arm with one hand, preventing her from cracking her head on the coffee table, and my other hand never left the arm of the couch.\n\nShe stood up, looked at me in the eyeballs, and said, \"you pushed me off the couch!\" I didn't, but she's 3 and toddlers gonna toddler. I explained that I did not push her, she fell, but I did catch her so she didn't get hurt.\n\nThe issue arose when my SO told me to just apologize for pushing her. At first it was a joke (I think?) but then suddenly he was serious and we were fighting. He legitimately wanted me to apologize for pushing her, even though he admitted he knew I didn't. He said it's important to teach her to apologize. He said she thinks I pushed her, so I should just apologize for it because in her mind I hurt her. He said I'm allowing my pride and my childhood trauma to interfere with my parenting. He said I have an issue with apologizing. \n\nI don't think we should be teaching her to apologize for things she didn't do. I think that's an awful thing to teach a child, and it's setting her up to be taken advantage of. However, I DO have some trauma regarding this topic (my dad made me admit to and apologize for things I didn't do or never even happened all the time), so I'm worried I can't trust myself here. Maybe I am clouded.\n\nTL;DR 3 year old fell off the couch and thought I pushed her. SO is angry I won't apologize for something I didn't do to keep the peace. Am I wrong for allowing it to become a big thing when I could've just said sorry and ended it?", "created_utc": 1691875958, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pg950/aita_for_refusing_to_apologize_for_pushing_my_3/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, 3 is young but not too young to learn what is good behaviour and what isn't. He's setting you up for a shed load of hassle. Nta", "NTA if he wanted to teach his daughter how to apologize, he would be asking said daughter to apologize for lying (you didn\u2019t push her) and then apologize for jumping recklessly to begin with. Or even better he can apologize to you in front of her for trying to make you apologize for something you did not do. If he\u2019s not open to those options, then it\u2019s not about teaching the child to apologize\u2026 he wants to focus on you and is raising so many red flags", "NTA. This is a weird battle for your SO to be fighting. Yes, it\u2019s good to teach kids to apologise for things they\u2019ve done to hurt others, whether intentional or accidental. But\u2026..you *didn\u2019t* do the thing she thinks you did. Why on earth would you want to teach your kid that people are entitled to demand an apology for any damn thing, whether you did it or not?", "NTA. This is so weird. Child falls, you break fall so she doesn't hit head and SO gets mad. \n\nThat just makes no sense.", "NTA\nThough if an apology is,wanted in a similar situation, try something like \"I'm sorry you slipped on the couch, but happy I was there to stop you hurting yourself.\"", "The only thing you should apologize for, is for not stopping him earlier. NTA", "First time parents? \nShit like this happens, it's unavoidable.\nWhat usually works is overacting something the youngling finds funny. Then they'll forget what they were mad about. \nIt's however terrible to argue with your SO in front of the child, not if it's in a normal tone. But yelling is nono.", "Not the ahole.  She is 3 and needs to learn that apologies are for when you did something that was unintentionally done.\n\nHeck, my daughter fell a few times, and once it was because she didn't see me move my foot. I apologized for her tripping over my foot and told that she needs to be careful when walking.\n\nWe both hugged and said we're sorry to each other, then laughed it off.\n\nTeach them to apologize when they do something that accidentally hurt someone, and they will hopefully know that accidents happen, but taking responsibility for their actions is the right thing to do.", "NTA\n\nToddlers learn by example, don't teach them that they can \"lie\" and get sympathy.\n\nYes, I know it's not a conventional lie, but still. My son is a god damn menace in this regard (and I still love him dearly lol).", "NTA. I can sort of see where your SO is coming from, because adults absolutely should model behaviors like apologizing when they\u2019re wrong. But, why does he think you should apologize for something you didn\u2019t do just to keep the peace? What kind of lesson does *that* teach your 3yo?", "NTA BUT\n\nSeems therapy is needed if you think that your trauma may be affecting you. Although it also seems like your trauma is helping you parent better in this instance. You caught your kid and prevented her from getting hurt and your SO knows this. \nSitting down with your kid and your SO and ask her what she thinks happened. Ask why she thinks you pushed her. Then explain your reaction. Calmly.", "NTA but your partner is using this incident to air grudges he has about things he doesn\u2019t like about you in a mean and manipulative way. Not a good look for him.", "NTA BUT!!! You should have apologized lightly when it happened. Your pride does seems slightly visible. You\u2019re not teaching her to apologize for things she didn\u2019t do (she thought you pushed her. You\u2019re teaching her that sometimes we don\u2019t know what upsets people until they tell us and it\u2019s ok to say sorry and validate one\u2019s feelings. \n\nYour not apologizing for pushing her. You\u2019re apologizing for making her feel scared. She\u2019s little and didn\u2019t grasp the total situation correctly. You are the adults. If she thinks you hurt her why not just offer a little \u201cI\u2019m sorry baby, I would never try to hurt you\u201d or something. Less about the actual push and more about her feelings. \n\nI think that would have been a far more compassionate approach then \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u201d.", "NTA here. However It's not like it's going to become a recurring thing you making her believe she should apologise for things she didn't do. In her mind you hurt her and as a child that's not something they quickly forget as you know. Apologise and move on from it.", "Wow your kid is that manipulative already? Don't cave into it, as it will become learned behaviour that will continue into school and life. Also sounds like your SO doesn't want to deal with confrontation with the child......", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But you all seem pretty stubborn. You and your SO have created a fight out of nothing. I would sit down with my child when she\u2019s calm and let her know that I love her more than anything and would never purposely push her. Let her know that you were trying to help her from falling but that you can understand how she may have perceived it differently.

It's having the exact opposite effect on her.", "I do not think her daughter was \"lying\". She did not make a claim KNOWING what she was saying was not true. Her daughter made that determination from her 3 year old context clues. This really has nothing to do with the 3 year old and everything to do with a father that thinks teaching people to apologize for things they didn't do to make others happy is completely misguided and wrong.", "We weren't yelling, but it still probably wasn't a conversation we should've been having in front of our kids. Truthfully though, we don't fight very often, which is a big part of why I posted here. We're normally very in sync when it comes to parenting.", "I've been in therapy most of my adult life haha.

Thank you for a very empathetic response.", "But OP didn\u2019t make the child feel scared - falling after jumping off the sofa did.", "I think she truly thought I pushed her. She's 3, and generally a very kind, sweet kid. I explained that I didn't push her, and that probably would've been the end of it.", "In my opinion I don\u2019t think they are.
