I truly appreciate them.", "Yta. Touching the chair makes you the asshole.  How would you like it if someone moved you to get something down even if it was to give it to you? Do not touch or move wheelchairs without permission", "I was sympathetic to you right up until you moved his chair. That's like grabbing someone's legs. YTA. \n\nWhat you did was you treated him as less-than. You didn't ask, you just did, and you TOUCHED HIS CHAIR. Don't do that. Ever. Ask first.", "YTA. First, do not EVER move a wheelchair without permission. Second, you assumed he needed help. Imagine you were reaching for a box of cereal and someone said \u201clet me help you,\u201d shouldered you aside, got it and handed it to you. That is what you did. You can ask if someone wants help, but you need to wait for the answer and respect it. And never, ever, ever, ever touch someone\u2019s wheelchair again.", "YTA\n\nFirst off never touch anyone's chair/equipment unless given out right permission. You were not doing it maliciously but imagine if your whole life people tried to take over doing basic things for you out of pity? Next time wait for a response", "YTA\n\nAsk if someone wants assistance - just like you would do with anyone who isn't visibly disabled. Treat mobility aids as an extension of the person and don't touch without permission.", "I was all ready to be on your side, but then you moved his chair. Oooof. I get that you just wanted to be helpful, but as soon as you moved him without his consent... YTA.\n\nYou had good intentions, but your friend was right.", "Moving his chair was very intrusive and disrespectful. It's the equivalent of shoving someone out of the way. Under the circumstances, I don't think his response was rude at all. YTA I'm afraid.", "Yes, YTA for moving the chair and not waiting for a response before jumping to help. But it's a learning moment, doesn't make an AH, just the AH in this situation.", "YTA. Moving someone\u2019s wheelchair without permission is incredibly rude, as rude as if you\u2019d grabbed someone by the shoulders and moved them aside. Take is as a lesson learned and be more mindful going forward", "YTA\n\nSorry. Thing is, the wheelchair is like a part of someone\u2019s body. It\u2019s like shoving someone out of the way to get at something, which is what you did. Also, if you\u2019re offering help, wait until they actually affirm your offer of help. Some people, like this guy I\u2019m sure, are independent and will want to help themselves. People in wheelchairs aren\u2019t helpless.", "YTA, though your intentions were good. Always consider an accommodation -- a wheelchair, a service dog, a cane, whatever -- an extension of the person's body and DO NOT TOUCH IT without consent.", "YTA\n\nThis is a \"now that you know better, you can do better\" situation. It's always best to offer help and wait for a response than it is to just take over. And just like you wouldn't pick up a person and move them unless they asked (or I hope you wouldn't), you shouldn't move someone using a wheelchair unless they ask you to.", "Yta, not for trying to help but for not asking first, and for moving the chair without permission. The chair is his personal space.", "YTA, but you don\u2019t have to stay the asshole. You meant well but didn\u2019t understand some things. \n\nAn assistive device (wheelchair, hearing aid, cane, crutch, service animal, glasses) are an extension of that person\u2019s body, and shouldn\u2019t be touched or grabbed without permission. They\u2019re like a second butt. Would you have gently cupped someone\u2019s ass to get the cereal? Then don\u2019t touch the chair.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to understand a lot of people with disabilities spend a lot of time and energy learning to do their best. When you step in and do things FOR them, it\u2019s more discouraging and hurtful than helpful.\n\nImagine if you\u2019d spent a semester in art class. You made a painting. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s better than where you started and you worked really hard on it. And someone comes along and says, \u201coh just let me\u2014\u201c and picks up a brush and \u201cfixes\u201d it for you. You\u2019d feel like shit, singled out, and embarrassed.\n\nSo in the future:\nIf you see someone (disabled or not) struggling, ASK \u201cwould you like me to grab X for you?\u201d\n\nAlso be prepared for the NO. For example, this guy could\u2019ve spent the last six months in PT practicing to reach something on a high shelf. This could be a victory moment for him.\n\nDon\u2019t touch a wheelchair or other device without explaining you\u2019re going to touch them and why, and asking permission (again, the same way you\u2019d explain if you had to put your hand on someone\u2019s butt to get by.)", "YTA Think you know now to ask if somebody wants help and wait for the response. And especially not to move somebody's chair or any other mobility aid - easy to remember if you treat the mobility aid as an extension of the person. You can ask yourself if you would push them out of the way if they didn't have the chair/other aid.", "Mild YTA. Many wheelchair users see their chair as an extension of themselves, so moving someone my chair isn\u2019t like moving a cart that\u2019s in the way. Unless you would shove a standing person out of the way, don\u2019t move someone in a wheelchair without them asking you to.\n\nYou were a bit presumptuous to help without him asking, and I think that probably bothered him because visibly disabled people are often infantilized, where people assume they always need help. As a short person, I would be happy if someone handed me something I was trying to reach, but people don\u2019t assume I can\u2019t take care of myself because I\u2019m short like they often do with wheelchair users. \n\nYTA for touching the chair, NAH for helping, but either way, ask disabled people if they want help before jumping in and doing things for them.", "YTA. Just because someone looks like they need help doesn\u2019t mean they want it. Ask and wait for confirmation.", "YTA - You have a good heart but if happens again let the person make sure that wants help", "YTA on moving the chair, you meant well but learn from this. Treating people\u2019s mobility equipment as any other inanimate object is disrespectful. It was nice to offer but you should wait for a response before acting either way.", "YTA \n\nShould have waited for a response and not moved the chair \n\nWould you push a short person out of the way to get an item off the top shelf they were reaching for?", "Oof, never EVER touch someone\u2019s wheelchair without permission, let alone manoeuvre it.\n\nAsk if someone wants assistance, then wait for an answer before providing it. Basic stuff.\n\nYTA", "Yes, YTA. It\u2019s great that you wanted to help, but physically moving him in his chair to get the item for him is a huge lack of personal space and boundaries. Next time, ask \u201chey, need some help with that?\u201d And wait for the reply. Not everyone wants or needs help, just because they are a wheelchair user or have some sort of alignment. There are others with disabilities whom may need help but you would not realize, don\u2019t just pick out those who seem like they have a disability based on items they may use (wheelchair, cane, etc).", "YTA. Moving his chair without his express permission is not ok. How would you feel if someone you didn't know just grabbed you and picked you up because they thought they should help you reach something?", "YTA. First, you should have asked if he wanted your help. Second, never move someone\u2019s chair. That\u2019s like pushing someone out of the way.", "As the person in the wheelchair, you did two things wrong. Never touch a wheelchair without permission. It's rude to push someone out of the way, even if it is to help them. Second, always ask if they need help and don't act until they say yes or no. \n\nDisabled people are often treated like they are less than, or children, or just straight up incompetent. While it may not have been your intention, you took the choice out of his hands and assumed he needed help. \n\nA gentle YTA, because you seem to genuinely want to help. The best help is offering and respecting the person's space and choice.", "Soft YTA, I know that your heart was in the right place, but in the future (if a similar situation were to happen again) it would be best to confirm if the person actually needs help or not.\n\nMoving that person's wheelchair would be the equivalent of someone taking you by the shoulders, and just moving you out of the way. Even if they were being nice about it, it would still feel a bit off to have someone do that to you without your consent.", "YTA. You just assumed he wanted or needed help AND you touched his personal property (his chair).  It is one thing to ask someone if they need help, or to help if they ask. It is entirely something else to just assume anyone who appears disabled needs or wants help.", "Oof. YTA but I think you have a kind heart and this was a learning lesson. Unless someone is like in danger or some kind of imminent situation, you should always ask \u201cwould you like help?\u201d Or even better, \u201cwould you like me to grab X?\u201d Touching a person\u2019s device is also a huge no-no. Think of it like an extension of their body. Plus, you could do more harm than good inadvertently.", "I get that you were trying to do a nice thing, but indeed YTA. Never, ever move someone\u2019s wheelchair without their consent. That was extremely rude and where you really became ableist. Also, before providing help to anyone, you should ask and wait for a response. I often tell my husband, \u201c it\u2019s not helping unless I actually want help\u201d. I can be simply reading the directions or taking a second to figure something out and he will grab it from me to do whatever I was trying to do. It\u2019s very frustrating because often times I would have been just as capable as he. He means well and just gets overexcited in helping, but it doesn\u2019t make him any less of a butthead when he does it. You are young and seem kind hearted. Take this as a learning experience and do better in the future!", "Why do you trust redditors more than a disabled man to articulate whether or not your interaction with him was appropriate?\n\nYTA", "YTA. Handing him the box is no problem. That's something you might do for anyone in the store struggling to reach something. But moving the guys chair is super disrespectful. It's robbing him of his autonomy of mobility, hence his dignity.", "YTA. Yes, you overstepped. Next time, ask if he wants help AND wait for a response. Don't just insert your able bodied self.", "Yeah YTA. Would you have been so presumptuous with someone that was not in a wheelchair? The least you could have done was ask if he wanted help.", "You meant well, but YTA.\n\nNext time, respectfully ask \"do you need me to grab that for you?\" If he says no, take no for an answer. Don't touch him or his wheelchair. Anything that comes across as condescending is a big no-no (and that goes for able-bodied people too).", "YTA. \n\nNever, ever, ever, *ever* touch someone's wheelchair without permission. And especially don't *move his chair* wtf. He's a human being, not an inanimate object. By moving him out of the way, you essentially treated him like a box that was in your way. It's unbelievably disrespectful. If an able-bodied person were in your way, would you just walk up to them and move them? Grab them by the shoulders or the arm and move them out of your way? My guess is that would never even occur to you to do that, so why would you do it to a wheelchair user? \n\nHad you not done that, I would think you had good intentions to help by getting the cereal box but ended up being a bit presumptuous. Next time you want to help, ask the person if they would like help and wait for them to answer before doing so.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't ask if he needed help. \n\nIt looked like he was struggling TO YOU\n\nNext time, it's easy to ask \"Oh do you need/could you use help with that?\"", "NTA. Making a well intentioned misstep does not make you an AH. You should not have moved his chair, and that was the mistake. I'm sure understand that now.", "YTA", "I love how doing the write thing now offends everyone. Fuck what a time to be alive.", "Yep. Don\u2019t move people around without their permission whether they\u2019re in a wheelchair or not. Unless it\u2019s an emergency, I guess. \n\nThe reason you\u2019re ableist, and we all know you are acting out of ignorance, is because you ignored the person\u2019s personal space and body autonomy. You assumed you had a right to move their body because you were helping them.  Think about it like eyeglasses. Would you reach over and adjust a stranger\u2019s glasses? No, that would be intrusive and weird. Don\u2019t put your hands on somebody\u2019s wheelchair, either. \n\nPro tip: don\u2019t touch people without their permission. Don\u2019t move their chairs, crutches, canes, or walkers unless they ask you to. Don\u2019t fix things for them unless they want you to. \n\nDisabled people get to have personal space too.", "Your friend is correct. However I wouldn't call you an AH, you tried to do the right thing, you tried to be thoughtful and kind , but did it the wrong way. Simply consider this a lesson learned. No need to consider yourself an AH over it, just uneducated on the best ways to help someone at the time. Now you know. We all make mistakes.", "YTA never touch a wheelchair without permission, it's the same as touching someone's body without permission", "YTA - you make yourself the superior person by moving them out of the way and doing what they were already doing for themselves.", "Done please do the same", "A very gentle YTA, it\u2019s great that you are mindful and considerate, but you did go about it in a bull in china shop kinda way, take this as learning experience you know what not to do next time!

That\u2019s kinda what you did in the supermarket. you are clearly a kind hearted person so don\u2019t take it too much to heart, and don\u2019t beat yourself up too much, just remember for next time.", "NTA. American youth have life in easy mode that your making up shit to be offended by. \u201cThat\u2019s ableist!\u201d Said no one ever in a starving third world country.", "You made a mistake OP, which makes you technically YTA I guess, but you're not ableist. You should ask someone if they need or want help rather than presume. Dude was a little harsh for sure but I'm sure he deals with shit like this all the time.

That makes it yta, as moving others without consent is never a good idea. \n\n(But I do think that OP can learn from this and didn't necessarily  intend it badly.) And originally I wrote nah.

I love when people can call out asshole behavior on this sub kindly. \n\nAnd yes, like another commenter pointed out, your edit is sweet.", "This 100%. If OP had done the same thing minus moving the chair it would be presumptuous, but not asshole territory imo. Moving the chair is def crossing a huge boundary.", "Literally. The chair touch without specific consent is a big nono. Ive seen people in wheelchairs drop something and struggle to pick it up and i always still ask them if i can grab that for them before proceeding. I would absolutely not touch their chair though in a situation where someone was reaching for something. When ive been walking into places theres been a few times someone in a wheelchair in front got stuck on the tracks, and id wait a few seconds then walk around so they could see my face and ask if they need help if it seemed like they genuinely needed it. Ive seen other people grab the back of their chair and push it over the tracks. A complete stranger. After 2 seconds of them trying to get over the tracks. (Actually one time i was on break on the second floor deck with like 15 coworkers and across the fence way there was all these townhouse ranchers and i heard someone yelling and yelling help help and so i jumped up and tried to get some of my coworkers to run down to the sound but they didn\u2019t want to, had to run around a whole block and climb over this guys fence who had been stuck in his chair on the tracks of his sliding door for over 12 hours and i was the first person who came to help, he brought me gifts every year as a thank you) \n\nI worked in ltc where most of our residents were full care ie 90% in wheelchairs and you still wait for consent to help them out if they need it. \n\nHaving a disability means certain things can take longer or can be harder. Doesn\u2019t mean that you do it for them. Theyre still a person. I don\u2019t particularly like it when men the same size as me grab stuff out of my arms thats heavy because \u2018im a woman\u2019. its the respectful thing to do according to them. But its not. Its really like saying im not able to do this. And i feel like having any type of visible disability would amplify this treatment 100x.", "Exactly.\n\nIt's also just so incredibly patronizing. Imagine being in the same position even as an abled person. You're reaching for something and about to grab it, when some stranger comes up, physically moves you aside/away, snatches it, then hands to you and goes, \"There you go.\" \n\nWould *you* really be a-okay with that? Or would you find it patronizing, belittling, humiliating, and presumptuous, *regardless* of the stranger's good intentions? \n\nA wheelchair user's chair is, for all intents and purposes, a part of their body. If you wouldn't move a person's body without their permission, then don't do the same to somebody's wheelchair.", "Putting this on top comment to emphasize since some people aren't getting it or are downplaying: medical devices are considered an extension of the person. Touching a medical device without consent is assault/battery. Further, moving the chair meant moving him. It doesn't matter if it was \"only a little.\" OP was still a stranger who went up to someone, grabbed him, and started to drag him somewhere. The man did not know OP, did not know where he was being taken, did not know OP's intentions. Maybe OP wanted to hurt him, maybe she was one of the \"disabled people are furniture and in my way\" people, maybe she was planning to steal from him and using \"I'm just helping!\" as an excuse to get close (which is unfortunately common). Obviously, OP wasn't planning to do those things *but he did not know that.* All he knew was someone put their hands on him and was dragging him somewhere. That's terrifying! OP is lucky to have only gotten what was essentially a \"don't touch me.\" \n\nNow, I recognize OP is young and ignorant. So, educate yourself. Learn from this experience. Call out other people you see doing this behavior and do better in the future. Always ask someone if they need help before you move to do so", "... prideful? \ud83e\udd14", "I am short and disabled and this is the right answer.", "Yep. This is how I feel. I split my time between a wheelchair on bad days and a walker on good days and they are extensions of my body. They re a part of me.

Would she be doing the right thing if she pushed a standing person?", "Really\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a Southerner (United States), and people are very naturally friendly here. This would be a common thing, as well as opening doors. Even someone not in a wheelchair having trouble reaching something would likely have a passerby get it for them. \n\nBut society, at least in the United States, seems to be moving toward a strict \u201cdon\u2019t interact with me in the slightest\u201d attitude. I had a lady trying to manage an agitated kid once, I opened a door for her (I was helping as an usher at a volunteer community theatre), and she snapped at me and got annoyed, saying \u201cI can open my own f**king door\u201d.  Also tried to stop a guy backing his truck up, he flipped me off, then backed into a parked car (which is why, surprise surprise, I was waving and saying \u201cSTOP!\u201d). Selling theatre tickets, a person ran their card and was declined, and it still had the \u201ccard needs to be activated\u201d sticker; suggested they may not have activated it, they snarkily said \u201cI know how to manage my credit card\u201d. After four declines, she stepped out, saw her make a call, then punch in a bunch of numbers. She came back, and viola\u2026card worked. \n\nI\u2019ve stopped doing anything like that unless I know the person. People take offense at everything. If asked for help, I\u2019m glad to, but I definitely don\u2019t volunteer it anymore. Too many people take it the wrong way.", "This is absolutely the worst response in this thread. RIP to any karma you may have.", "Yes, it was ableist. While OP's intentions were good, dismissing ableism is dismissing the problem. Something isn't not bigoted or discrimination just because the person didn't intend it that way. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, after all. OP was ableist in two ways: first was automatically interjecting instead of asking him if he needed help. This was incredibly infantilizing and was based off the assumption that wheelchair = inherently needing help. The other way was *moving him.* This is assault. It isn't \"a bit harsh\", you'd probably freak out if a stranger grabbed you and suddenly started dragging you somewhere. It doesn't matter if they didn't drag you very far. You don't know what they're doing, you don't know what their intentions are. That person is a stranger who decided to put their hands on you without consent. It's not an overreaction to react negatively towards that. (Which... he also wasn't rude. Saying \"don't get in my business\" is a boundary, not rudeness.)", "For everyone downvoting, that\u2019s ok, but I going off the opinion that OP has a good heart and did it with good intentions. For that reason I say NTA, which I think needs to include a malicious intent. \n\nI hope OP use this as a learning experience and continue to offer help but in a respectful way. \n\nAlso, I think the person they helped were completely right to express their displeasure at what OP did.", "Nope.
