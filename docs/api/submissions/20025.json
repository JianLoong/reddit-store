One thing about him is he hates wearing suits, will not wear a tie, will rarely wear a button up shirt and if so it will not be tucked in.  He says it makes him uncomfortable.  \n\nFor our wedding he did wear a very nice suit but no tie (I tried but he refused and obviously it wasn\u2019t going to be my hill to die on as this was the person I wanted to marry most importantly). He looked really good on the day. \n\nWe have been to a other dozen weddings together and whilst they don\u2019t usually specify dress codes, in our culture we do tend to dress up for weddings.  So usually I\u2019m very formal and he will wear a button up shirt not tucked in and chinos.  Sometimes a casual blazer.  He is always the most underdressed person but he doesn\u2019t care as long as he is comfortable.  Of course this bothers me but I don\u2019t say anything for these occasions, sometimes I suggest wearing darker colours to dress up the outfit more but that\u2019s as far as I go. \n\nHowever my brother\u2019s wedding is coming up and he is insisting on wearing the same wedding guest outfit he usually wears.  This is upsetting me as although there will be no bridal party, as he is part of the family he will have an important role in the wedding.  He will just stand out being dressed so casually especially for family photos and it upsets me that he doesn\u2019t want to make an effort for my brother\u2019s wedding.  He still has his wedding suit and won\u2019t even wear the suit pants and definitely won\u2019t tuck his shirt in and wear a belt even with chinos.   \n\nI cracked and told him I will be embarrassed to stand next to him on the day and now he is upset and called me controlling.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable because I have dropped this for all other weddings and i accept he won\u2019t wear a suit but think he should compromise by dressing up a little bit more (shirt tucked in, belt etc).

Do you believe that your husband's casual dress will cause an issue at the wedding?\n\nEdit, based on response: NTA He is knowingly taking advantage of the lack of an official dress code to underdress, ignoring the cultural expectations. I consider this an ahole move because people don't (usually) wear formal wear because they like it, they do so as a gesture of respect. By putting effort in your appearance (within reason, it is possible to go too far), despite minor discomfort, you show that you value the event. I disagree that you are being controlling by being embarrassed at his casual appearance, since you are going as a married couple his actions and attitude are associated with you, especially since this evwnt invalses your side of the family, not his, therefore you have the right to be angry when he ignores normal standards.", "NTA and I\u2019m not sure why you are with a guy who:\n\n1) Doesn\u2019t care about you enough to make sure you don\u2019t feel embarrassed in public\n2) Is extremely childish. Everyone feels uncomfortable in a suit. But we wear them to look good because it\u2019s the polite thing to do in certain situations. He\u2019s the only one who refuses to grow up and look past his own comfort.\n\nI am sure you have a list of positives about him. But my #1 alone is a major red flag. He doesn\u2019t care to make sure he won\u2019t embarrass you.", "NTA. Your husband is disrespectful and a sloppy dresser. Well tailored suits certainly don't have to be uncomfortable, your husband is just refusing to put out any effort.   \nFrankly, I'd just make him stay home. If he can't be presentable in public then he can just not go out in public.", "NTA.  Part of the social contract is we occasionally do things we might not otherwise because we love and respect others. This is one night and you aren't even asking for a full suit, small children can be taught to tuck in their shirts, so can he!  Also I'd have him post on r/Weddingattireapproval and see if he'll listen to the community on what is and is not appropriate to where to someone else's wedding.", "YNTA he\u2019s a sloppy dresser for formal occasions. He\u2019s not considerate of the people having the wedding he only wants to do what he wants and that makes him very selfish. If I were you I would have your brother talk to him directly about when he is expects at his wedding as far as the dress code", "NTA\n\nGoodness. There will be little children there in button downs with their shirts tucked in. There will likely be little boys there in suits. How embarrassing that a grown man can't tuck his shirt in and put on a belt for a few hours when he knows he will be in the wedding photos with you.", "Leave him home if he wants look inappropriate? Is he childish about a lot of things? Are you planning to have children because he seems very immature?", "NTA. Formal events have formal etiquette rules. Is there a particular reason he finds formal clothing uncomfortable? I get the belt thing- I hate them. But the way around it is to have actually fitting pants. Also- he refuses to tuck in his shirt. Is it a body image issue? Many men are way less likely to admit to body image issues and use I want to be comfortable as an excuse.", "Are you sure you didn't marry a toddler? Obviously NTA", "NTA\n\nNormaly i would have said the same about him too, but there is one little problem: you, his WIFE, feel uncomfortable and ashamed about the way he wants to be dressed at the wedding.\n\nBeing some \"random\" relative, underdressed and out of place at the wedding is one thing, and its fine if he doesnt care about the looks he gets, but willingly embarrassing his wife in a public setting is a whole other thing.\n\nSounds to me like this could very well turn into a \"hill to die on\", becasue he cares more about his comfort than your discomfort in a disproportionate amount.", "NTA. You could discuss the situation with your bother. Your family is probably well aware of the situation.\n\nIf he is 40 and unable to understand dressing appropriately maybe he could stay home. He is the one being arrogant and controlling.\n\nAnd no, I don't think you need to feel bad for saying he is embarrassing, because he is.", "My husband\u2019s similar (hates suits/ties/dressing up/etc) and will usually just do a tucked in button down under a nice sweater to a wedding or something dressy. I never push him because I\u2019m not a super dressy person myself, but I also don\u2019t have to because he 100% will grin and bare it for an occasion that he needs to wear a suit or tie to.\n\nLike, he knows the difference in wardrobe required between my old college friend\u2019s wedding and my brother\u2019s. He may even bitch and moan, and double check with me \u201cI have to wear a suit\u2026?\u201d but he\u2019s asking that as he\u2019s already pulling the one suit he owns out of the closet. Because he knows this is the time for it and just wants to grumble.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll pull out heels, which I hate wearing, and we\u2019ll commiserate together, but we suck it when we need to because we\u2019re grown.\n\nSo NTA. This made me appreciate that my husband at least has the ability to suck it up when necessary.", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult.  Time for him to act like one.", "INFO does he have sensory difficulties? \nIs it some kind of a disability thing? \n\nEveryone is uncomfortable in fancy clothing.. But it seems to me, that he might is finding it harder than other people to wear uncomfortable clothing?", "If he is really not prepared to wear a suit, just buy him a onesie or one of those blankets you wear and insist that wears that.", "ESH\n\nHe's obviously a massive AH, a selfish and immature man who thinks that his comfort comes before any consideration or respect for other people. And unless he has genuine sensory issues that mean that wearing a suit  or tucking his shirt in cause him SIGNIFICANT discomfort or pain (which I doubt, if he's willing to wear chinos or a casual sport jacket, which don't feel any different in terms of cut, seams, etc. than a suit), then he's not even that genuinely uncomfortable, he just doesn't LIKE the feeling of more structured/tailored clothing. Which is his right, but again, he's still an AH for thinking that supercedes all consideration for anyone else.\n\nBut while I don't usually believe in blaming people for someone else's behaviour, I do believe in calling out enablers. And in this case, you're an AH because you've been enabling his ridiculously childish behaviour from the start. You married him. You married this 40-year-old man who won't dress appropriately for any social occasion that isn't a backyard BBQ or a day at the beach, and have been giving him the impression throughout your relationship that you think that his selfish, self-centered, inappropriate behaviour is acceptable because you've not only been willing to accept it, you agreed to spend the rest of your life with someone who behaves this way. You said it yourself: it wasn't as important to you as being with him.  \n\nExcept that suddenly, when it's super embarrassing, it IS important. So maybe now you should be sorry that you \"have dropped this for all the other weddings\" . . . because all you did was teach him that you were okay with him pulling this nonsense when the occasions weren't important to you personally (which, BTW, also makes you an AH . . . that you didn't care about the weddings of people who cared enough about you to invite you to celebrate with them, to expect your husband to dress appropriately). And all HE'S doing is continuing to behave the way he always has. You got exactly what you paid for, a husband who has never misrepresented himself and who you never held to a higher standard. And now you're upset about it. You're both pretty dreadful. ESH.", "NTA and why would you marry a slob?", "NTA\n\nHe needs to bw an adult and respect the dress code. By not doing that not only is disrespecting you but the whole guests and hosts. \n\nI would tell him that if he cannot follow the dress code, he better stay home where he can wear comfy pijamas and call it a day. He is the AH", "INFO what is the wedding dress code?", "I don\u2019t understand the shirt hanging out, unless it\u2019s a tee or polo. How old is he? 12?", "NTA. Weddings happen so rarely during the year. He can put his big boy pants on and \u201csuffer\u201d through one night of being uncomfortable. \n\nMy husband was similar but when I told him it was important to me for us to dress up on certain holidays, he did it as a compromise which is what normal people do in relationships. Now he enjoys it and sees my perspective. We got married young so these things are to be expected.", "YTA Not for wanting your husband to be a little more dressy since he will be in wedding photos (I guess. Maybe he won't.) But for telling him you will be embarrassed by him.", "I\u2019m so surprised by these answers. If this was post was written by a man asking if he was the asshole because he\u2019s embarrassed to be with his wife who will wear a dress to weddings but not a *fancy enough* dress everyone would be calling him out. \n\nYou married your husband knowing he was a casual guy. He\u2019s not comfortable in a suit and tie. You can\u2019t force him to be comfortable in a suit and tie and I\u2019m astonished that you would want him to be uncomfortable just so you have someone prettier to walk around with. \n\nThere\u2019s no dress code, so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for him to wear chinos.", "YTA\nHe\u2019s your husband, not your child. You\u2019re supposed to honor him, stand behind him, and support him. Throwing a fit over how a grown man wishes to dress himself is absurd. You stated you were well aware in advance that he hates wearing suits, this isn\u2019t a surprise to you. That\u2019s his decision, respect it.", "INFO--- how do your brother and his fiancee feel about it? Do they want to strictly enforce a dresscode that your husband simply plans to ignore? \n\nIf they do have a strict dress code, and they tell your husband he can't attend unless he's wearing proper attire, will your husband feel disrespected or offended that he's being \"excluded\"? (He isn't, but would he act like he is?) Would he try to crash the wedding anyway and break the dress code, or would he be relieved to have the dress code as an excuse to just stay home altogether and not have to go to the wedding anyway? \n\nDo you have any reason to believe he wants an excuse to avoid these events in the first place, as if it's a matter of convenience if he ends up being disinvited when his conditions aren't met?\n\n>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable because I have dropped this for all other weddings...\n\n... The problem is, that's exactly why he doesn't think it's an issue. Your preferences have never outweighed his comfort before. Asking him to obey the dress code *someone else* has set for THEIR wedding does not make YOU controlling. Not at all. You are not responsible for apologizing to *other* people and getting them to grant him special concessions for the type of clothing he wants to wear, and that seems to be what he expects you to do--- to make his excuses for him. \n\nFeel free to tell him you're not controlling but he can't be either, and you're no longer going to be responsible for arranging special circumstances to accommodate him--- he's a grown-ass man and he can do that himself. You do know the man you married, and that this has always been an issue for him. That doesn't mean his issue is your fault. Let ***him*** tell your brother he's not willing to show up if he has to tuck in his shirt. \n\n...Now on the other hand if he doesn't want to go to these events with you anyway and you feel like you're dragging him there in the first place, that's a separate issue. I'd stick with just explaining that it's not your responsibility to get him out of the reasonable dress code requirements other people set for their events and that it's not about control, you're just hurt that he'd rather stand you up at your own brother's wedding and leave you there alone than tuck in his shirt for three hours to be there with you. Or, if he's \"allowed\" to be there but won't dress up, explain that his refusal to wear conventional wedding clothes at your family's weddings makes you feel like he's disrespecting your family. Just explain how the level of effort he's willing to put into how he presents himself towards your family makes you *feel*. You may disagree about dress codes but it doesn't invalidate your feelings when he decides to ignores the code at a certain event.\n\nThis isn't really about shirts, it's about your priorities towards each other.", "Did you really just post that you chastised him for \"not making an effort\" for your brother's wedding because he won't wear what you want him to, but - you married him while he wasn't wearing a tie? You thought you would fix him, didn't you. He's not broken, and YTA.", "I've read enough on reddit about it know YTA ... you can't dictate what your partner wears, they can wear whatever makes them comfortable", "YTA. I'd say otherwise if the people actually getting married had asked him to dress up, but judging from your post, none of them did. This is a 40 year old man. He's not trying to impress anyone, he's not a groom or groomsman. *Hopefully* he's not telling you what to wear, either. I'm sorry his lack of formal attire embarrasses you, but you just can't control other people, even when you're married to them.", "You are NTA for thinking your husband should compromise, but may be one expecting him to. You knew your husband did not like dressing up for any occasion. You barely got him in a suit for your own wedding. He is behaving exactly like he did before you married him. Your husband did not do a bait and switch. I'm not sure you have a right to complain. You picked him.  You said his mode of dress for your wedding wasn't the hill you were going to die on. Is your brother's wedding that hill?", "What does your brother think? If he isn\u2019t bothered then if you didn\u2019t want to die on this hill at your wedding, his wedding should not be the place to do it.\n\nI understand why you\u2019re frustrated but pushing the issue & saying he embarrasses you won\u2019t help. Unfortunately, there can be consequences if he\u2019s not dressed appropriately. It will be up to the bride & groom whether or not they want to include him in any formal pictures.\n\nYour husband needs to stop making other people\u2019s events about himself. Formal dress code is not optional. \n\nESH", "YTA. The fact that you are embarrassed by the attire of another human being is just silly. It's immature.

I didn\u2019t think I would \u201cfix\u201d or \u201cchange\u201d him as I don\u2019t try to for all other events but thought maybe a compromise would be acceptable here?", "There is no dress code however as mentioned there is usually an unspoken dress code for weddings of our culture and men wear suits (tie optional).  My brother wouldn\u2019t be happy and would be disappointed but also wouldn\u2019t be the type to make an issue out of it.", "There is no dress code however as mentioned there is usually an unspoken dress code for weddings of our culture and men wear suits (tie optional).  My brother wouldn\u2019t be happy and would be disappointed but also wouldn\u2019t be the type to make an issue out of it.\n\nI didn\u2019t push the tie at our wedding but he still wore a nice (very expensive) designer suit which is just sitting in his wardrobe collecting dust.  I don\u2019t expect this at other weddings but considering it is a family wedding I thought he would dress up a little more.", "Is it within an acceptable dress code though?", "It\u2019s a wedding, dress properly or don\u2019t go.", "Thank you.. I completely agree and as a woman who has to wear professional dress a lot and I would very much like not too I resent when I am dictated too about my clothes. Let\u2019s switch this narrative and he is dictating what she can and cannot wear and says he is embarrassed to be seen with her and see the monkeys fly. He dressed up for her important day and just because she liked how he looked he was uncomfortable and she fucking knew this going in. YTA because I am sure the double standard would apply if he told you he was embarrassed to be seen with you.", "Can\u2019t he wear a button shirt and dress pants and suit jacket and belt and tuck it in for pictures and then untuck it the rest of the time?\n\nI also echo not understanding why he\u2019s so uncomfortable. I would offer to send him to a tailor that can custom make him something from a suiting material that\u2019s got lots of stretch in it and a softer less scratchy material. I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019d tried to optimize shirts too with something softer possibly with some stretch in it. I wouldn\u2019t worry if he wears the most unstylish thing but just generally conforming with the dress code. Have you tried a clip on tie and upsizing the neck on the shirt slightly?", "She doesnt need to ask. He needs to dress accordingly to the event. In her country everyone dresses up, then he needs to do it or not going", "I wear a suit (or a blazer and slacks, usually wool) 3 to 5 times a week (I am a prosecutor in rural Northern California) and I do not find suits uncomfortable.  In fact if I have something after work I will usually not bother changing- I am involved in community theatre and I have attended scores of rehearsals in my court clothes (I do take the jacket off). Sounds like there's some self-imposed mental barrier here.", "Not the woman in you. And formal clothing that fits well is not not uncomfortable. Including ties. I was at a funeral visitation today. Wore a suit and tie. Because it demonstrates RESPECT for others. That you care enough about them to go the extra distance. Weddings are the same. It is about making the extra effort one might not normally make. OP\u2019s husband is a clown. Both emotionally and physically. All he\u2019s missing is the red nose.", "I myself only got a comfortable suit when I was old enough to understand sizing and afford to get every piece tailored.", "It\u2019s because most people\u2019s experience with suits is some cheap off the rack monstrosity, generally made of poor quality fabrics and definitely not properly fitted. \n\nA good suit is comfortable, and a great suit is like wearing a massage.", "Unless you\u2019re in a perfectly tailored suit which most of us aren\u2019t, they\u2019re not nearly as comfortable as you think.", "Suits are comfy.  Anybody who says different is wearing their 15 year old suit that doesn\u2019t fit anymore.   \n\nDress clothes tend to be made of better material than tshirts.  I\u2019d wear a dress shirt and tie every day if I could", "You realise that not all suits are tailored, right? I doubt that someone who hates wearing suits is going to have a tailored one for the handful of times in their life that they have no option other than to wear it.", "That would just mean OP\u2019s husband is even more of an asshole because he\u2019s refusing to wear something that is actually comfortable.\n\nWhich would mean my vote is correct.", "Well at your wedding you can specify \"no suits allowed\" as the dress code. Someone else's wedding who wants suits? Put on a fucking suit or don't go.", "Suits are sexy AF. Especially ladies in suits.", "Only in context. A suit would look ridiculous at a BBQ or a football match. But at a wedding where everyone else is dressed up, casual clothes without even the shirt tucked in would look ridiculous.", "Is he like this for weddings only? or does he also dress sloppy for funerals?\n\nHonestly, I'd leave him at home if he doesn't shape up.", "Tell him if he can\u2019t wear a suit and tie to just stay home because you\u2019re too embarrassed to have him in the family pictures anyway", "If he can't put big boy pants on for one night, that's pathetic", "Expecting people to wear formal attire at formal events is not controlling. If you don't like it, you can just not go - nobody is forcing him to go! How are they controlling him? Is it controlling to not let people go to funerals in neon-coloured tracksuits? What's next, society is too controlling because people can't show up in swimsuits at job interviews?", "It\u2019s pretty close to it, if you can\u2019t be bothered dressing appropriately for a special event you\u2019re a slob", "Would he be less disappointed by a sloppily dressed guest or if your husband stayed at home? I think that should be your guide for what to do.", "Welp, the problem you have is this is the guy you selected. You knew this was his \u201cthing\u201d and he\u2019s unwilling to compromise. Luckily, at a family event, everyone knows he isn\u2019t going to wear a suit. Nobody will be surprised.\n\nMy advice is for you to let it go. On your insides. Withdraw this irritation from yourself. Simply stop caring what he wears. This might take a bit of practice. But every time your brain begins to dwell on his clothes, you must tell yourself to stop it. He is otherwise a good person, and you aren\u2019t going to dwell on it anymore.\n\nYou can be happy, and you can let this stop bothering you, it will take a bit of courage on your part, but if you try, it can be done.\n\nGood luck!", "[removed]", "He would die in my country. Weddings are mostly black tie events\u2026 men in tuxedos\u2026 and venues can ban you if you are not dress accordingly, even if the bride and groom think is ok. He wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to cross the door! Lol", "But there is no dress code for this event.", "You are dictating and using emotional blackmail to get your way. If he did this to you, you would be rightfully livid. He has the right to decide what he puts on his body and what he comfortable in. These are your standards not his. You married him knowing this. This is a you problem and your embarrassment is actually an embarrassment in yourself because you do not accept him for who you knew he was.", "A cultural expectation isn't really the same as a dress code, unfortunately.  If your brother would be disappointed that his BIL didn't dress up, then your brother should speak to him before the wedding.", "It\u2019s your brother\u2019s day. Tell him the issue & ask how he feels about it. Maybe he should speak to your husband? \n\nIf your husband will create a distraction or unnecessary drama at this event, he should either dress appropriately or should not attend. You can\u2019t force him to wear a suit but you can go without him.", "YTA. You are controlling. Who are you trying to impress? You obviously don't care about your husband's comfort.", "You tell us - what\u2019s the stated dress code for your brother\u2019s wedding?", "He\u2019s still wearing a suit, just not to her standard. It\u2019s not to her standard. He isn\u2019t rolling up in gym shirts and a tank top.", "Girls can wear suits. It's my comfortable option for when I don't want to do the heels and dress, so it's weird to hear people say, oh obviously suits are uncomfortable.", "His wedding suit is likely tailored to him, or he likely can afford to get it tailored at the ripe young age of 40. It sounds like they have enough occasions to justify the cost.\n\nEdit: OP said the wedding suit is tailored in a comment", "Cool?", "I\u2019d rather not look like someone from 1800", "A 40yo slob! He was single before that for a reason\u2026", "Or she can leave him at home and enjoy the wedding with her family without wondering if everyone else is looking at him and thinking that the man she picked can't even put up with the \"discomfort of a suit\" for 5 hours in order to show respect to her and the wedding couple.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Heels go beyond uncomfortable into actually painful to wear for extended periods. Damn near anything short of bondage wear is more comfortable than heels.", "Totally irrelevant to the comment you replied to lol", "Then just avoid the suitcoats that are very short in the front and very long in the back. Also a more modern tie over the frippery of a cravat.", "Yeah. That's another way of saying girls have way different thresholds for these things, which makes the idea of a suit being uncomfortable seem absurd to me.", "I believe you are referring to a \u201cmorning coat\u201d.", "And I'm saying the threshold of discomfort women are expected to put up with when it comes to fashion is bad and wrong and shouldn't be applied to anyone.", "Ok, I'm still gonna wear heels tho."]}
