One thing about him is he hates wearing suits, will not wear a tie, will rarely wear a button up shirt and if so it will not be tucked in.  He says it makes him uncomfortable.  \n\nFor our wedding he did wear a very nice suit but no tie (I tried but he refused and obviously it wasn\u2019t going to be my hill to die on as this was the person I wanted to marry most importantly). He looked really good on the day. \n\nWe have been to a other dozen weddings together and whilst they don\u2019t usually specify dress codes, in our culture we do tend to dress up for weddings.  So usually I\u2019m very formal and he will wear a button up shirt not tucked in and chinos.  Sometimes a casual blazer.  He is always the most underdressed person but he doesn\u2019t care as long as he is comfortable.  Of course this bothers me but I don\u2019t say anything for these occasions, sometimes I suggest wearing darker colours to dress up the outfit more but that\u2019s as far as I go. \n\nHowever my brother\u2019s wedding is coming up and he is insisting on wearing the same wedding guest outfit he usually wears.  This is upsetting me as although there will be no bridal party, as he is part of the family he will have an important role in the wedding.  He will just stand out being dressed so casually especially for family photos and it upsets me that he doesn\u2019t want to make an effort for my brother\u2019s wedding.  He still has his wedding suit and won\u2019t even wear the suit pants and definitely won\u2019t tuck his shirt in and wear a belt even with chinos.   \n\nI cracked and told him I will be embarrassed to stand next to him on the day and now he is upset and called me controlling.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable because I have dropped this for all other weddings and i accept he won\u2019t wear a suit but think he should compromise by dressing up a little bit more (shirt tucked in, belt etc).

Do you believe that your husband's casual dress will cause an issue at the wedding?\n\nEdit, based on response: NTA He is knowingly taking advantage of the lack of an official dress code to underdress, ignoring the cultural expectations. I consider this an ahole move because people don't (usually) wear formal wear because they like it, they do so as a gesture of respect. By putting effort in your appearance (within reason, it is possible to go too far), despite minor discomfort, you show that you value the event. I disagree that you are being controlling by being embarrassed at his casual appearance, since you are going as a married couple his actions and attitude are associated with you, especially since this evwnt invalses your side of the family, not his, therefore you have the right to be angry when he ignores normal standards.", "NTA and I\u2019m not sure why you are with a guy who:\n\n1) Doesn\u2019t care about you enough to make sure you don\u2019t feel embarrassed in public\n2) Is extremely childish. Everyone feels uncomfortable in a suit. But we wear them to look good because it\u2019s the polite thing to do in certain situations. He\u2019s the only one who refuses to grow up and look past his own comfort.\n\nI am sure you have a list of positives about him. But my #1 alone is a major red flag. He doesn\u2019t care to make sure he won\u2019t embarrass you.", "NTA. Your husband is disrespectful and a sloppy dresser. Well tailored suits certainly don't have to be uncomfortable, your husband is just refusing to put out any effort.   \nFrankly, I'd just make him stay home. If he can't be presentable in public then he can just not go out in public.", "NTA.  Part of the social contract is we occasionally do things we might not otherwise because we love and respect others. This is one night and you aren't even asking for a full suit, small children can be taught to tuck in their shirts, so can he!  Also I'd have him post on r/Weddingattireapproval and see if he'll listen to the community on what is and is not appropriate to where to someone else's wedding.", "YNTA he\u2019s a sloppy dresser for formal occasions. He\u2019s not considerate of the people having the wedding he only wants to do what he wants and that makes him very selfish. If I were you I would have your brother talk to him directly about when he is expects at his wedding as far as the dress code", "NTA\n\nGoodness. There will be little children there in button downs with their shirts tucked in. There will likely be little boys there in suits. How embarrassing that a grown man can't tuck his shirt in and put on a belt for a few hours when he knows he will be in the wedding photos with you.", "Leave him home if he wants look inappropriate? Is he childish about a lot of things? Are you planning to have children because he seems very immature?", "NTA. Formal events have formal etiquette rules. Is there a particular reason he finds formal clothing uncomfortable? I get the belt thing- I hate them. But the way around it is to have actually fitting pants. Also- he refuses to tuck in his shirt. Is it a body image issue? Many men are way less likely to admit to body image issues and use I want to be comfortable as an excuse.", "Are you sure you didn't marry a toddler? Obviously NTA", "NTA\n\nNormaly i would have said the same about him too, but there is one little problem: you, his WIFE, feel uncomfortable and ashamed about the way he wants to be dressed at the wedding.\n\nBeing some \"random\" relative, underdressed and out of place at the wedding is one thing, and its fine if he doesnt care about the looks he gets, but willingly embarrassing his wife in a public setting is a whole other thing.\n\nSounds to me like this could very well turn into a \"hill to die on\", becasue he cares more about his comfort than your discomfort in a disproportionate amount.", "NTA. You could discuss the situation with your bother. Your family is probably well aware of the situation.\n\nIf he is 40 and unable to understand dressing appropriately maybe he could stay home. He is the one being arrogant and controlling.\n\nAnd no, I don't think you need to feel bad for saying he is embarrassing, because he is.", "My husband\u2019s similar (hates suits/ties/dressing up/etc) and will usually just do a tucked in button down under a nice sweater to a wedding or something dressy. I never push him because I\u2019m not a super dressy person myself, but I also don\u2019t have to because he 100% will grin and bare it for an occasion that he needs to wear a suit or tie to.\n\nLike, he knows the difference in wardrobe required between my old college friend\u2019s wedding and my brother\u2019s. He may even bitch and moan, and double check with me \u201cI have to wear a suit\u2026?\u201d but he\u2019s asking that as he\u2019s already pulling the one suit he owns out of the closet. Because he knows this is the time for it and just wants to grumble.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll pull out heels, which I hate wearing, and we\u2019ll commiserate together, but we suck it when we need to because we\u2019re grown.\n\nSo NTA. This made me appreciate that my husband at least has the ability to suck it up when necessary.", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult.  Time for him to act like one.", "INFO does he have sensory difficulties? \nIs it some kind of a disability thing? \n\nEveryone is uncomfortable in fancy clothing.. But it seems to me, that he might is finding it harder than other people to wear uncomfortable clothing?", "If he is really not prepared to wear a suit, just buy him a onesie or one of those blankets you wear and insist that wears that.", "ESH\n\nHe's obviously a massive AH, a selfish and immature man who thinks that his comfort comes before any consideration or respect for other people. And unless he has genuine sensory issues that mean that wearing a suit  or tucking his shirt in cause him SIGNIFICANT discomfort or pain (which I doubt, if he's willing to wear chinos or a casual sport jacket, which don't feel any different in terms of cut, seams, etc. than a suit), then he's not even that genuinely uncomfortable, he just doesn't LIKE the feeling of more structured/tailored clothing. Which is his right, but again, he's still an AH for thinking that supercedes all consideration for anyone else.\n\nBut while I don't usually believe in blaming people for someone else's behaviour, I do believe in calling out enablers. And in this case, you're an AH because you've been enabling his ridiculously childish behaviour from the start. You married him. You married this 40-year-old man who won't dress appropriately for any social occasion that isn't a backyard BBQ or a day at the beach, and have been giving him the impression throughout your relationship that you think that his selfish, self-centered, inappropriate behaviour is acceptable because you've not only been willing to accept it, you agreed to spend the rest of your life with someone who behaves this way. You said it yourself: it wasn't as important to you as being with him.  \n\nExcept that suddenly, when it's super embarrassing, it IS important. So maybe now you should be sorry that you \"have dropped this for all the other weddings\" . . . because all you did was teach him that you were okay with him pulling this nonsense when the occasions weren't important to you personally (which, BTW, also makes you an AH . . . that you didn't care about the weddings of people who cared enough about you to invite you to celebrate with them, to expect your husband to dress appropriately). And all HE'S doing is continuing to behave the way he always has. You got exactly what you paid for, a husband who has never misrepresented himself and who you never held to a higher standard. And now you're upset about it. You're both pretty dreadful. ESH.", "NTA and why would you marry a slob?", "NTA\n\nHe needs to bw an adult and respect the dress code. By not doing that not only is disrespecting you but the whole guests and hosts. \n\nI would tell him that if he cannot follow the dress code, he better stay home where he can wear comfy pijamas and call it a day. He is the AH", "INFO what is the wedding dress code?", "I don\u2019t understand the shirt hanging out, unless it\u2019s a tee or polo. How old is he? 12?", "NTA. Weddings happen so rarely during the year. He can put his big boy pants on and \u201csuffer\u201d through one night of being uncomfortable. \n\nMy husband was similar but when I told him it was important to me for us to dress up on certain holidays, he did it as a compromise which is what normal people do in relationships. Now he enjoys it and sees my perspective. We got married young so these things are to be expected.", "YTA Not for wanting your husband to be a little more dressy since he will be in wedding photos (I guess. Maybe he won't.) But for telling him you will be embarrassed by him.", "I\u2019m so surprised by these answers. If this was post was written by a man asking if he was the asshole because he\u2019s embarrassed to be with his wife who will wear a dress to weddings but not a *fancy enough* dress everyone would be calling him out. \n\nYou married your husband knowing he was a casual guy. He\u2019s not comfortable in a suit and tie. You can\u2019t force him to be comfortable in a suit and tie and I\u2019m astonished that you would want him to be uncomfortable just so you have someone prettier to walk around with. \n\nThere\u2019s no dress code, so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for him to wear chinos.", "YTA\nHe\u2019s your husband, not your child. You\u2019re supposed to honor him, stand behind him, and support him. Throwing a fit over how a grown man wishes to dress himself is absurd. You stated you were well aware in advance that he hates wearing suits, this isn\u2019t a surprise to you. That\u2019s his decision, respect it.", "INFO--- how do your brother and his fiancee feel about it? Do they want to strictly enforce a dresscode that your husband simply plans to ignore? \n\nIf they do have a strict dress code, and they tell your husband he can't attend unless he's wearing proper attire, will your husband feel disrespected or offended that he's being \"excluded\"? (He isn't, but would he act like he is?) Would he try to crash the wedding anyway and break the dress code, or would he be relieved to have the dress code as an excuse to just stay home altogether and not have to go to the wedding anyway? \n\nDo you have any reason to believe he wants an excuse to avoid these events in the first place, as if it's a matter of convenience if he ends up being disinvited when his conditions aren't met?\n\n>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable because I have dropped this for all other weddings...\n\n... The problem is, that's exactly why he doesn't think it's an issue. Your preferences have never outweighed his comfort before. Asking him to obey the dress code *someone else* has set for THEIR wedding does not make YOU controlling. Not at all. You are not responsible for apologizing to *other* people and getting them to grant him special concessions for the type of clothing he wants to wear, and that seems to be what he expects you to do--- to make his excuses for him. \n\nFeel free to tell him you're not controlling but he can't be either, and you're no longer going to be responsible for arranging special circumstances to accommodate him--- he's a grown-ass man and he can do that himself. You do know the man you married, and that this has always been an issue for him. That doesn't mean his issue is your fault. Let ***him*** tell your brother he's not willing to show up if he has to tuck in his shirt. \n\n...Now on the other hand if he doesn't want to go to these events with you anyway and you feel like you're dragging him there in the first place, that's a separate issue. I'd stick with just explaining that it's not your responsibility to get him out of the reasonable dress code requirements other people set for their events and that it's not about control, you're just hurt that he'd rather stand you up at your own brother's wedding and leave you there alone than tuck in his shirt for three hours to be there with you. Or, if he's \"allowed\" to be there but won't dress up, explain that his refusal to wear conventional wedding clothes at your family's weddings makes you feel like he's disrespecting your family. Just explain how the level of effort he's willing to put into how he presents himself towards your family makes you *feel*. You may disagree about dress codes but it doesn't invalidate your feelings when he decides to ignores the code at a certain event.\n\nThis isn't really about shirts, it's about your priorities towards each other.", "Did you really just post that you chastised him for \"not making an effort\" for your brother's wedding because he won't wear what you want him to, but - you married him while he wasn't wearing a tie? You thought you would fix him, didn't you. He's not broken, and YTA.", "I've read enough on reddit about it know YTA ... you can't dictate what your partner wears, they can wear whatever makes them comfortable", "YTA. I'd say otherwise if the people actually getting married had asked him to dress up, but judging from your post, none of them did. This is a 40 year old man. He's not trying to impress anyone, he's not a groom or groomsman. *Hopefully* he's not telling you what to wear, either. I'm sorry his lack of formal attire embarrasses you, but you just can't control other people, even when you're married to them.", "You are NTA for thinking your husband should compromise, but may be one expecting him to. You knew your husband did not like dressing up for any occasion. You barely got him in a suit for your own wedding. He is behaving exactly like he did before you married him. Your husband did not do a bait and switch. I'm not sure you have a right to complain. You picked him.  You said his mode of dress for your wedding wasn't the hill you were going to die on. Is your brother's wedding that hill?", "What does your brother think? If he isn\u2019t bothered then if you didn\u2019t want to die on this hill at your wedding, his wedding should not be the place to do it.\n\nI understand why you\u2019re frustrated but pushing the issue & saying he embarrasses you won\u2019t help. Unfortunately, there can be consequences if he\u2019s not dressed appropriately. It will be up to the bride & groom whether or not they want to include him in any formal pictures.\n\nYour husband needs to stop making other people\u2019s events about himself. Formal dress code is not optional. \n\nESH", "YTA. The fact that you are embarrassed by the attire of another human being is just silly. It's immature.

If you want a partner who will make concessions for you then don\u2019t marry someone who won\u2019t. \n\nDon\u2019t marry someone knowing exactly who they are then be surprised when they are being exactly themselves. \n\nIf that\u2019s not the trait you want then move on and be with someone who you are more compatible with. She did this to herself. She knew exactly the type of partner he was.  \n\nYou can not change people. And people love in different ways. He may not see this as a slight against how he feels about her or her family. People just don\u2019t operate the same.", "Yeah. Attending your partners siblings wedding is a pretty basic assumption of a partner. If he doesn\u2019t go the backlash would be deserved", "If you body and weight stay the same for a decade then you\u2019re a much better person than I am.", "This comment should be higher up.", "Not so true. I will agree there are men out there with that attitude but not all of us are that way.\n\nI as a guy at 60 HATE suits, I find them very confining if the fit the way they are meant to. I much prefer looser clothing. \n\nAs for events that a suit should be worn. I like them just as much as a causal bbq in my back yard. \n\nBut with all that said I do wear suits when they should be worn such as at a wedding, unless it is specifed as suits not to be warn.", "There are a few companies that make full-bust shirts but they are $$$$.", "Bamboo. If you run hot, get bamboo clothing. Your sweaty balls will thank me.", "All I have to say is that she knew this about him before she married him. In my book, that makes her a controlling asshole. Don't marry someone with plans to change who they are. That is ridiculous. Even if they are on board, if you marry them before they changed, you asked for it because people rarely truly change.\n\n\n\n\nYTA", "Actually only a grown matture man would capable of deciding what he wears instead of succumbing to the social pressure!\n\nDon't you think the toddlers are the people who let other tell them what to wear?", "Yet there are plenty of men who don\u2019t care about that stuff but I found women talk badly about other women, so maybe that\u2019s a bigger source of your frustration ?", "Women don't have to do all that.\n\nI literally just attended a wedding. I looked about as good as it gets for me. Makeup took 5 minutes. Getting dressed took 5. I depilated my legs, which I do once a month anyway. I wore flats. Nothing was uncomfortable.\n\nIf you want to look a certain way and it's unfortunate, you can choose to do that. But you can also choose not to.", "If you ever needed confirmation that there is an obvious gender bias on this sub this is it.\n\n2k upvotes for a comment that is essentially \"shut up and stop complaining because women have it harder\".", "Boohoho. Who asked about what women go through in this thread? It\u2018s about OP\u2018s husband Ms. Egocentric.", "You're doing most of that for the other women there, not the men.", "You wear that out of choice", "\n\nI'm not totally disagreeing with you, and I realize you're speaking about a specific gendered dynamic/societal pressure, but you can break free of the Spanx.", "Except when it's really hot out and women can wear light dresses but men are required to be in suits.  In that situation, the men have it worse.  FAR WORSE.", "So men need to play this ridiculous game too? The solution to you isn\u2019t \u201cwomen should just do this less\u201d it\u2019s \u201cmen should suffer too\u201d? \n\nStockholm syndrome much?", "Yeah, if he doesn't tuck in the shirt then he looks like a total shlub. He will stand out in the photos. For some families weddings are one of the few events that allow them to finally get a nice family photo that they can put on the wall. Everyone else will look nice and he will look like he's rounding the end of a bender.", "Ok, as an aside. I need to talk to you. I\u2019m also a petite enby AFAB. I\u2019ve always said, if I could find a tuxedo that made me look great, I\u2019d be all in! What was the process like for finding a tailor and getting a suit?", "NB AFAB here. Check out Kirrin Finch online \u2014 it\u2019s menswear made for AFAB bodies. I was shocked I was able to get an off-the-rack suit considering I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d and have a large chest.", "I hate both.  Suits and the events that require them.", "Yeah as a guy who likes parties I was very confused. Suits are fine.", "I\u2019m AMAB but have dabbled into female clothing, I\u2019ve found dresses and stuff to be super comfy. The extra airflow between the legs is so fucking nice. Those pointy shoes are nightmares tho", "Well one option is hitting the shops with suits some of them over tailor made but in my experience they don't do afab people and are more expensive\n\n\nI just looked for individual tailors in my area whose work I liked, who did 3 pieces for men and suits for women and just hit her up with \"can you do a 3 piece for me? \"", "Just did the same search. The website doesn't seem to factor in the \"casual\" part. Some of the jersey dresses are definitely wedding appropriate due to quality and cut. Others are definitely not!", "Hi, what\u2019s the name of the retailer please?", "Mine did that in the middle of a softball game, I pulled it off under my shirt and tossed it in the garbage can while I was waiting to bat much to the amusement of my mostly male teammates. Seriously though, could they not design them so they don't become deadly weapons when they inevitably start to fall apart?"]}
