One thing about him is he hates wearing suits, will not wear a tie, will rarely wear a button up shirt and if so it will not be tucked in.  He says it makes him uncomfortable.  \n\nFor our wedding he did wear a very nice suit but no tie (I tried but he refused and obviously it wasn\u2019t going to be my hill to die on as this was the person I wanted to marry most importantly). He looked really good on the day. \n\nWe have been to a other dozen weddings together and whilst they don\u2019t usually specify dress codes, in our culture we do tend to dress up for weddings.  So usually I\u2019m very formal and he will wear a button up shirt not tucked in and chinos.  Sometimes a casual blazer.  He is always the most underdressed person but he doesn\u2019t care as long as he is comfortable.  Of course this bothers me but I don\u2019t say anything for these occasions, sometimes I suggest wearing darker colours to dress up the outfit more but that\u2019s as far as I go. \n\nHowever my brother\u2019s wedding is coming up and he is insisting on wearing the same wedding guest outfit he usually wears.  This is upsetting me as although there will be no bridal party, as he is part of the family he will have an important role in the wedding.  He will just stand out being dressed so casually especially for family photos and it upsets me that he doesn\u2019t want to make an effort for my brother\u2019s wedding.  He still has his wedding suit and won\u2019t even wear the suit pants and definitely won\u2019t tuck his shirt in and wear a belt even with chinos.   \n\nI cracked and told him I will be embarrassed to stand next to him on the day and now he is upset and called me controlling.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable because I have dropped this for all other weddings and i accept he won\u2019t wear a suit but think he should compromise by dressing up a little bit more (shirt tucked in, belt etc).

Do you believe that your husband's casual dress will cause an issue at the wedding?\n\nEdit, based on response: NTA He is knowingly taking advantage of the lack of an official dress code to underdress, ignoring the cultural expectations. I consider this an ahole move because people don't (usually) wear formal wear because they like it, they do so as a gesture of respect. By putting effort in your appearance (within reason, it is possible to go too far), despite minor discomfort, you show that you value the event. I disagree that you are being controlling by being embarrassed at his casual appearance, since you are going as a married couple his actions and attitude are associated with you, especially since this evwnt invalses your side of the family, not his, therefore you have the right to be angry when he ignores normal standards.", "NTA and I\u2019m not sure why you are with a guy who:\n\n1) Doesn\u2019t care about you enough to make sure you don\u2019t feel embarrassed in public\n2) Is extremely childish. Everyone feels uncomfortable in a suit. But we wear them to look good because it\u2019s the polite thing to do in certain situations. He\u2019s the only one who refuses to grow up and look past his own comfort.\n\nI am sure you have a list of positives about him. But my #1 alone is a major red flag. He doesn\u2019t care to make sure he won\u2019t embarrass you.", "NTA. Your husband is disrespectful and a sloppy dresser. Well tailored suits certainly don't have to be uncomfortable, your husband is just refusing to put out any effort.   \nFrankly, I'd just make him stay home. If he can't be presentable in public then he can just not go out in public.", "NTA.  Part of the social contract is we occasionally do things we might not otherwise because we love and respect others. This is one night and you aren't even asking for a full suit, small children can be taught to tuck in their shirts, so can he!  Also I'd have him post on r/Weddingattireapproval and see if he'll listen to the community on what is and is not appropriate to where to someone else's wedding.", "YNTA he\u2019s a sloppy dresser for formal occasions. He\u2019s not considerate of the people having the wedding he only wants to do what he wants and that makes him very selfish. If I were you I would have your brother talk to him directly about when he is expects at his wedding as far as the dress code", "NTA\n\nGoodness. There will be little children there in button downs with their shirts tucked in. There will likely be little boys there in suits. How embarrassing that a grown man can't tuck his shirt in and put on a belt for a few hours when he knows he will be in the wedding photos with you.", "Leave him home if he wants look inappropriate? Is he childish about a lot of things? Are you planning to have children because he seems very immature?", "NTA. Formal events have formal etiquette rules. Is there a particular reason he finds formal clothing uncomfortable? I get the belt thing- I hate them. But the way around it is to have actually fitting pants. Also- he refuses to tuck in his shirt. Is it a body image issue? Many men are way less likely to admit to body image issues and use I want to be comfortable as an excuse.", "Are you sure you didn't marry a toddler? Obviously NTA", "NTA\n\nNormaly i would have said the same about him too, but there is one little problem: you, his WIFE, feel uncomfortable and ashamed about the way he wants to be dressed at the wedding.\n\nBeing some \"random\" relative, underdressed and out of place at the wedding is one thing, and its fine if he doesnt care about the looks he gets, but willingly embarrassing his wife in a public setting is a whole other thing.\n\nSounds to me like this could very well turn into a \"hill to die on\", becasue he cares more about his comfort than your discomfort in a disproportionate amount.", "NTA. You could discuss the situation with your bother. Your family is probably well aware of the situation.\n\nIf he is 40 and unable to understand dressing appropriately maybe he could stay home. He is the one being arrogant and controlling.\n\nAnd no, I don't think you need to feel bad for saying he is embarrassing, because he is.", "My husband\u2019s similar (hates suits/ties/dressing up/etc) and will usually just do a tucked in button down under a nice sweater to a wedding or something dressy. I never push him because I\u2019m not a super dressy person myself, but I also don\u2019t have to because he 100% will grin and bare it for an occasion that he needs to wear a suit or tie to.\n\nLike, he knows the difference in wardrobe required between my old college friend\u2019s wedding and my brother\u2019s. He may even bitch and moan, and double check with me \u201cI have to wear a suit\u2026?\u201d but he\u2019s asking that as he\u2019s already pulling the one suit he owns out of the closet. Because he knows this is the time for it and just wants to grumble.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll pull out heels, which I hate wearing, and we\u2019ll commiserate together, but we suck it when we need to because we\u2019re grown.\n\nSo NTA. This made me appreciate that my husband at least has the ability to suck it up when necessary.", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult.  Time for him to act like one.", "INFO does he have sensory difficulties? \nIs it some kind of a disability thing? \n\nEveryone is uncomfortable in fancy clothing.. But it seems to me, that he might is finding it harder than other people to wear uncomfortable clothing?", "If he is really not prepared to wear a suit, just buy him a onesie or one of those blankets you wear and insist that wears that.", "ESH\n\nHe's obviously a massive AH, a selfish and immature man who thinks that his comfort comes before any consideration or respect for other people. And unless he has genuine sensory issues that mean that wearing a suit  or tucking his shirt in cause him SIGNIFICANT discomfort or pain (which I doubt, if he's willing to wear chinos or a casual sport jacket, which don't feel any different in terms of cut, seams, etc. than a suit), then he's not even that genuinely uncomfortable, he just doesn't LIKE the feeling of more structured/tailored clothing. Which is his right, but again, he's still an AH for thinking that supercedes all consideration for anyone else.\n\nBut while I don't usually believe in blaming people for someone else's behaviour, I do believe in calling out enablers. And in this case, you're an AH because you've been enabling his ridiculously childish behaviour from the start. You married him. You married this 40-year-old man who won't dress appropriately for any social occasion that isn't a backyard BBQ or a day at the beach, and have been giving him the impression throughout your relationship that you think that his selfish, self-centered, inappropriate behaviour is acceptable because you've not only been willing to accept it, you agreed to spend the rest of your life with someone who behaves this way. You said it yourself: it wasn't as important to you as being with him.  \n\nExcept that suddenly, when it's super embarrassing, it IS important. So maybe now you should be sorry that you \"have dropped this for all the other weddings\" . . . because all you did was teach him that you were okay with him pulling this nonsense when the occasions weren't important to you personally (which, BTW, also makes you an AH . . . that you didn't care about the weddings of people who cared enough about you to invite you to celebrate with them, to expect your husband to dress appropriately). And all HE'S doing is continuing to behave the way he always has. You got exactly what you paid for, a husband who has never misrepresented himself and who you never held to a higher standard. And now you're upset about it. You're both pretty dreadful. ESH.", "NTA and why would you marry a slob?", "NTA\n\nHe needs to bw an adult and respect the dress code. By not doing that not only is disrespecting you but the whole guests and hosts. \n\nI would tell him that if he cannot follow the dress code, he better stay home where he can wear comfy pijamas and call it a day. He is the AH", "INFO what is the wedding dress code?", "I don\u2019t understand the shirt hanging out, unless it\u2019s a tee or polo. How old is he? 12?", "NTA. Weddings happen so rarely during the year. He can put his big boy pants on and \u201csuffer\u201d through one night of being uncomfortable. \n\nMy husband was similar but when I told him it was important to me for us to dress up on certain holidays, he did it as a compromise which is what normal people do in relationships. Now he enjoys it and sees my perspective. We got married young so these things are to be expected.", "YTA Not for wanting your husband to be a little more dressy since he will be in wedding photos (I guess. Maybe he won't.) But for telling him you will be embarrassed by him.", "I\u2019m so surprised by these answers. If this was post was written by a man asking if he was the asshole because he\u2019s embarrassed to be with his wife who will wear a dress to weddings but not a *fancy enough* dress everyone would be calling him out. \n\nYou married your husband knowing he was a casual guy. He\u2019s not comfortable in a suit and tie. You can\u2019t force him to be comfortable in a suit and tie and I\u2019m astonished that you would want him to be uncomfortable just so you have someone prettier to walk around with. \n\nThere\u2019s no dress code, so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for him to wear chinos.", "YTA\nHe\u2019s your husband, not your child. You\u2019re supposed to honor him, stand behind him, and support him. Throwing a fit over how a grown man wishes to dress himself is absurd. You stated you were well aware in advance that he hates wearing suits, this isn\u2019t a surprise to you. That\u2019s his decision, respect it.", "INFO--- how do your brother and his fiancee feel about it? Do they want to strictly enforce a dresscode that your husband simply plans to ignore? \n\nIf they do have a strict dress code, and they tell your husband he can't attend unless he's wearing proper attire, will your husband feel disrespected or offended that he's being \"excluded\"? (He isn't, but would he act like he is?) Would he try to crash the wedding anyway and break the dress code, or would he be relieved to have the dress code as an excuse to just stay home altogether and not have to go to the wedding anyway? \n\nDo you have any reason to believe he wants an excuse to avoid these events in the first place, as if it's a matter of convenience if he ends up being disinvited when his conditions aren't met?\n\n>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable because I have dropped this for all other weddings...\n\n... The problem is, that's exactly why he doesn't think it's an issue. Your preferences have never outweighed his comfort before. Asking him to obey the dress code *someone else* has set for THEIR wedding does not make YOU controlling. Not at all. You are not responsible for apologizing to *other* people and getting them to grant him special concessions for the type of clothing he wants to wear, and that seems to be what he expects you to do--- to make his excuses for him. \n\nFeel free to tell him you're not controlling but he can't be either, and you're no longer going to be responsible for arranging special circumstances to accommodate him--- he's a grown-ass man and he can do that himself. You do know the man you married, and that this has always been an issue for him. That doesn't mean his issue is your fault. Let ***him*** tell your brother he's not willing to show up if he has to tuck in his shirt. \n\n...Now on the other hand if he doesn't want to go to these events with you anyway and you feel like you're dragging him there in the first place, that's a separate issue. I'd stick with just explaining that it's not your responsibility to get him out of the reasonable dress code requirements other people set for their events and that it's not about control, you're just hurt that he'd rather stand you up at your own brother's wedding and leave you there alone than tuck in his shirt for three hours to be there with you. Or, if he's \"allowed\" to be there but won't dress up, explain that his refusal to wear conventional wedding clothes at your family's weddings makes you feel like he's disrespecting your family. Just explain how the level of effort he's willing to put into how he presents himself towards your family makes you *feel*. You may disagree about dress codes but it doesn't invalidate your feelings when he decides to ignores the code at a certain event.\n\nThis isn't really about shirts, it's about your priorities towards each other.", "Did you really just post that you chastised him for \"not making an effort\" for your brother's wedding because he won't wear what you want him to, but - you married him while he wasn't wearing a tie? You thought you would fix him, didn't you. He's not broken, and YTA.", "I've read enough on reddit about it know YTA ... you can't dictate what your partner wears, they can wear whatever makes them comfortable", "YTA. I'd say otherwise if the people actually getting married had asked him to dress up, but judging from your post, none of them did. This is a 40 year old man. He's not trying to impress anyone, he's not a groom or groomsman. *Hopefully* he's not telling you what to wear, either. I'm sorry his lack of formal attire embarrasses you, but you just can't control other people, even when you're married to them.", "You are NTA for thinking your husband should compromise, but may be one expecting him to. You knew your husband did not like dressing up for any occasion. You barely got him in a suit for your own wedding. He is behaving exactly like he did before you married him. Your husband did not do a bait and switch. I'm not sure you have a right to complain. You picked him.  You said his mode of dress for your wedding wasn't the hill you were going to die on. Is your brother's wedding that hill?", "What does your brother think? If he isn\u2019t bothered then if you didn\u2019t want to die on this hill at your wedding, his wedding should not be the place to do it.\n\nI understand why you\u2019re frustrated but pushing the issue & saying he embarrasses you won\u2019t help. Unfortunately, there can be consequences if he\u2019s not dressed appropriately. It will be up to the bride & groom whether or not they want to include him in any formal pictures.\n\nYour husband needs to stop making other people\u2019s events about himself.

Turns out that it helps if you get one the right size and cut for you, and also maybe wear one more than once a decade so it doesn\u2019t feel too unusual.\n\nIf this guy can handle chinos, a blazer and an untucked shirt, there\u2019s absolutely no reason why he can\u2019t wear matching trousers and jacket, with a tucked-in shirt for a day.", "Yeah I remember as a kid hearing about the horrors of being stuck in a monkey suit, but they\u2019re far from uncomfortable, it can be a bit of a to do getting ready but no more than his wife getting ready for the same event, this is a strange hill for him to die on", "Heat, mostly (that's the complaint I usually hear). If they wear a tie that's a legitimate comfort complaint as well, I'd hate to have something thick wrapped around my neck! But there are clever clipons that can look the part with less discomfort.", "I was with you until the babies part. Most men don\u2019t know how to wear suits and thus wear ill fitting ones. A poorly fitting suit is very uncommon. It\u2019s restrictive in the arms and chest. It scratches the back of the neck, it puts pressure on the waist and makes siting uncomfortable. A well fitted high quality suit has none of these issues but most men don\u2019t own a well fitted, high quality suit, and I say this as a man who wears a suit almost every day.", "Let me preface this by saying that I used to wear suits to work everyday and still wear them as needed to formal occasions, so I\u2019m more than willing to wear a suit.\n\nThey\u2019re hot as hell. Like I\u2019m almost always sweating if I have a suit on unless it is really cold. If it\u2019s 65f/17c in the room, I\u2019m sweating. It\u2019s like wearing two shirts and then keeping your coat on inside.\n\nI know that some women\u2019s clothing and many women\u2019s shoes are uncomfortable, but I also look at a lot of my wife\u2019s dresses with envy. I\u2019d be much more comfortable in many of them than I am in a suit.\n\nShould OP\u2019s husband dress up more for the wedding, absolutely. But don\u2019t tell me what clothing I have to find comfortable.", "I\u2019m not a woman but I whole heartedly agree. Suits aren\u2019t uncomfortable at all.", "Found the sexist. I hate suits. They are very uncomfortable. Maybe you should stop insulting and start empathizing.", "Some guys like the feel, but for most, suits that fit and feel good are *expensive*.\n\nHere's where I'm going to chime in with my personal stuff which may or may not apply to OP's husband. Identify and sensory issues. I spent a lot of time growing up and even as a young man not having much, if any, control over what I wore, did, spent time with. Once you break free and carve that sense of self, it is something you cling onto, so if you don't feel \"yourself\" wearing something, you'll fight tooth and nail to not do it (think about how many posts we see here about a trans person being asked to dress as their gender assigned at birth and how quick we are to defend them)\n\nSensory wise, I personally detest the feeling of ties, if I *have* to wear one it's with the top button undone and the knot loose, and you can bet that badboy comes off asap. I just hate the feeling of things around my neck. Sometimes the creases/seams can be a real issue for me too. Then there's a constant anxiety of checking your shirt is tucked. The weight distribution of some suits can feel weird as well.", "My husband doesn't even own a tie I think but always wears suits to weddings or funerals.", "Go wear it every day. Not as a fun option, as a weather appropriate option, but as your only option. Appoint a couple of people in your environment as on-duty women that will shame and insult your clothing choice every time you do not wear it.  \n\nYour hate is showing, it is not a good look.", "I\u2019m not a woman but I whole heartedly agree. Suits aren\u2019t uncomfortable at all.", "So then stop doing those things. Are you really so ugly that you need 2 hours? Women overdue it then complain about it.", "I do lol. I\u2019m the only one I trust to take care of my clothes.", "He is the one being arrogant and controlling,,", "Nobody would cry abuse if a husband insisted his wife wear a dress-code appropriate outfit to a special occasion.", "Is it possible that your husband is autistic/neurodiverse and struggles with sensory processing issues?\n\nI think you're NTA, but there must be a way for him to compromise, at least for photos, as this is a sign of respect in your culture. \n\nMaybe he is genuinely unconcerned because he doesn't understand. If he *does understand the culture/how important this is to you/that it may offend your brother, but is willing for your *brother to suffer emotional discomfort, then he's being outright selfish and childish. \n\nHe may still be autistic tho/ have different physical limits of his own that he's struggling to communicate, and therapy might be helpful for him. \n\nGood luck, I hope y'all can reach a compromise.", "Of the rack suits never fit perfect. Every suit needs to be tailored.", "If he wore it then and it was tailored for him, it might be possible to get it altered to fit him now. At least it\u2019s worth a try!  Good luck!", "Certain events have certain expected standards of dress. If you don\u2019t like that, you don\u2019t have to come.", "Honestly, he just shouldn\u2019t be invited to this wedding.", "I saw that. A nice suit without a tie for his own wedding seems a bit ridiculous.", "It kinda does though.", "Sorry i disagree i have autism and anything constructive is very uncomfortable", "You need to get all the way over yourself and stop being so controlling.", "Lol. If a woman showed up to a wedding grossly underdressed and looking like a slob and her spouse was embarrassed I'd vote the same. Dress up or don't come, it's as simple as that.", "No no no no no no. Please no stretch in the suit. Contrary to what you might think that\u2019ll emphasize the discomfort and stuffiness. Instead get a well made suit in a fine wool. Something between super 130 to super 180 would be ideal. They\u2019re not the sturdies garments but that shouldn\u2019t matter if he won\u2019t wear them often. *make sure it\u2019s well made*. The softness of the fabric won\u2019t mean anything if it\u2019s a poorly made garment. Small armholes, well fitting shoulders and room in the chest, no slim fits please. That\u2019ll give the best range of motion and comfort.", "I 100% agree that is is disrespectful the way OP\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t show up appropriately. Disrespectful, self centered and honestly bratty.\n\nTHAT SAID, ties are literally least comfortable thing in the world to me. My body temperature goes up like 50 degrees and I will sweat profusely from my forehead. I avoid them unless absolutely necessary! I say this as someone who wears pretty wild things in general that give me blisters, rashes and aches - happily suffer for fashion but ties are just evil.", " NTA\n He's an adult. Time for him to act like one.", "I think I need to watch a sitcom about your life! or a quirky Northern Exposure type show! you sound awesome!!!", "Exactly. An Ill fitting suit is an uncomfortable suit. A well fitting suit is very comfortable.", "Every cat or dog I have ever had loved/loves stealing suitcoats and sleeping on the silky interior.  It does feel very nice.", "Heat shouldn\u2019t be an issue with the right suit. Something in a lighter fabric in an open weave with little structure is very comfortable in the heat. More so than shorts and a tee shirt as it shields your skin from the sun while still allowing airflow. Also clipons most definitely don\u2019t look the part, in fact they make you look like a little boy who can\u2019t tie a tie.", "The irony of women being naturally colder than men but your formal wear is suits and ours is dresses... Should be the other way really, ha", "It costs 50 bucks at most to get a reasonably fitting suit tailored and any suit you buy should be reasonably fitting. Most of the time is closer to $20. The only time I\u2019ve spent more is to get two suits my grandfather gave me restructured. That was expensive as hell.", "Yes they are and I say that as someone who wears one every day.  It costs less than 50 bucks to have a suit tailored. Tailoring a suit isn\u2019t something for the upper classes, infact its part of owning a proper suit.", "A proper suit isn\u2019t uncomfortable. Get a high quality tailored suit and I guarantee it\u2019ll look and feel great, even if you won\u2019t admit it.", "Yeah that's exactly what's going on here, drama queen.", "Actually they literally have in previous posts lmfao. Telling them to leave this controlling asshole.", "Seersucker begs to differ.", "This is such a bad take. Anyone not wanting to wear a suit isn't a slob.", "I do too. You have a disability which makes you an exception. A normal adult without sensory issues shouldn\u2019t have that problem.", "In a different comment so you get notified, unstructured suits do exist. They\u2019re not my cup of tea (I Iike double breasted suits, shoulder pads, stiff waistbands, and I wear a detachable starched collar with my tux) but they can look quite elegant and are appropriate for your average wedding.", "The opinions that matter are the bride and groom. If they\u2019re fine with causal wear, then that\u2019s what he can wear. If they want formal wear, then if he\u2019s not willing to wear that he shouldn\u2019t go. Have respect for your hosts.", "What he's wearing isn't a suit lol. It's a sloppy excuse for a sport coat at best.", "I use a tie to hide the fact my fat neck cant button the top button", "Personally I think u/FitBit8124 needs to be the lead in a romcom. Maybe an enemies-to-lovers plotline with the love interest being a fellow actor in the theatre.", "Ah blumburg. I admit I too will rub my cheek against it on occasion.", "Since you have such a firm grasp on his finances based on so much information, how much should he spend to wear clothes that he hates because his wife finds him embarrassing?\n\nDoes he then get to dictate what his wife wears too? Maybe her skirt is embarrassing, so she should buy some clothes that he finds appropriate for the situation they're in, even if she doesn't like that?\n\nCome on, think it through. No one should be forced to wear clothes they don't like (especially expensive ones that don't get much use) because their partner finds them embarrassing. That's a huge YTA for the partner (OP in this case), not the person that doesn't like wearing certain clothes.", "Why are people making this a comfortability argument? I like dressing up, the whole nine (just FYI) but it has nothing to do with comfortability, and you\u2019re never going to win that argument. I\u2019m never going to be as comfortable in a suit as I am in sweats and a t shirt at home, stop pretending other wise. What is thread\u2026", "What can be recognized as a suit evolved in the mid 1800s. The modern suit was popularized in the 1920s and has remained relatively intact for the past hundred years, with detailed such as lapel width and gorge hight, length, cut, and accessory\u2019s changing.", "I don\u2019t want to wear a suit either out of personal preference I\u2019d rather wear a hoodie and be comfortable but I\u2019m definitely wearing one if it\u2019s expected of me cos I\u2019m not a fucking baby lol \n\n\nWhat kind of a grown ass man doesn\u2019t wanna tuck in a shirt cos its more \u201ccomfy\u201d.", "They do not have a dress code she has repeated that. The brother has not came to him about it, that was all her. The host have not set the expectations or the rules and until they do then her using her insecurities to emotionally blackmail him makes her the AH.", "Or a defense attorney, since they\u2019re a prosecutor?", "There is a certain level of decorum that is expected at certain events and she is embarrassed because he refuses to abide by it.   It would absolutely be reasonable if roles were reversed and OP was wearing clothing that did not follow decorum for the event.", "He's not being forced to wear clothes he doesn't like because his wife finds them embarrassing. His clothes are embarrassing because they do not suit the social expectations for the occasion, therefore he shouldn't wear them. If his wife is the only person who has problems with his clothes, then she's likely the problem, but so many people have pointed out that it's not respectful to show up to formal weddings without even tucking your shirt in. You're acting like OP is the only person on earth with these opinions when these are long-established social conventions. His clothes are inappropriate for the events he's attending, regardless of what his wife thinks. She's not the only person who has to see him. Do you think he should be free to wear whatever he wants at a funeral too?\n\nIf I wear a bikini or a white wedding dress or a tracksuit to someone else's formal wedding, my partner will absolutely find that fucking embarrassing, but the bigger problem and the reason why I shouldn't do that is because it's disrespectful to everyone at that event, not just my partner.\n\nAlso, like I said, his wedding suit is tailored to fit him. There's no need to spend a single more cent for him to dress appropriately.", "No thank you. As a civilized member of society I will continue to show up to the by weekly bord review in a frock coat and cravat.", "I mean, yeah, it might make him a baby, but not a slob.", "I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s not an asshole. I just think they should ask the bride and groom what they want.", "Or - hear me out - BOTH! A newly arrived defense attorney joins the local theatre as a way to get to know people. Their battles in the courtroom start spilling onto the stage when they get cast as Petruchio and Katherina in The Taming of the Shrew. But as they rehearse together, will they be able to resist their growing attraction? Featuring endless comical meddling from other theatre members, and some sage advice from a stern but well-meaning judge.", "And yet no one seems to have ever called him out on it except for OP? \n\nIt's very possible to look smart without wearing a suit.\n\nI think it's OK to say \"Hey, mind dressing a bit smarter?\", but not be controlling over what the other person wears. If a man was telling his wife she HAD to wear a certain outfit, it absolutely wouldn't be acceptable. Neither is this acceptable.\n\nBut let's be real here. The top comment is saying that it's a \"red flag\" and questioning their whole relationship based off this one thing. That's an extreme overreaction.", "You're comparing wearing a bikini, wedding dress or tracksuit to wearing a relatively smart shirt and pants, just because it's not a suit?", "Refusing to wear a suit when you're supposed to wear a suit makes you a slob.", "She asked him to just wear the suit pants and he refused. He refused to even tuck in his shirt - she's not making him wear a suit at all, and she is asking him to dress smarter like you said and he's refused all options. In what world is an untucked shirt in chinos an acceptable outfit for a formal event?", "I know it doesn\u2019t mean much to most people but khakis and a sport coat with an untucked shirt are a far cry from a suit in formally. The untucked shirt adds a level of sloppiness.", "Noone expects women to wear high heels. That's entirely on y'all. Stop wearing them and none of us will bat an eye.", "If their is not a dress code, which OP stated, why is he \"supposed\" to wear a suit? Serious question.", "It depends on the event and who's there. Maybe it's an American thing but in the UK, no one really cares, the bride and groom will obviously be dressed up, people who are actually a part of the wedding somehow (OP said there is no bridal party) but generally people can wear what they want.\n\nI'd say it's far less rediculous than suggesting OP should divorce her husband that she's happy being with over what pants he wants to wear to a wedding.", "So that's the same as a bikini?", "Because there are certain societal expectations of dress for certain events. There may not be a dress code for a funeral but you know damn well not show up in a clown suit. It\u2019s the same deal for wedding, even if there isn\u2019t a stated dress code it\u2019s expected that people show up looking presentable. OP herself stated that in their culture is expected to wear a suit for wedding.", "In that it\u2019s in inappropriate for the event at hand, yes.", "Clown suit at funeral example is absurd. Get real. Do you have to wear a suit to a wedding or a funeral? Absolutely not. \n\nYou do realize their is an in-between of a suit and a clown costume, right? I own 3 suits. I've definitely worn slacks and a dress shirt and tie to a formal event. We get it dude you like suits, but it doesn't mean you're a slob if you don't wear one."]}
