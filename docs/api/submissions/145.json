Saying, \"Yeah, I could not make it.\" would have ended the inquiry. Sorry you are dealing with office politics spurred by the party.", "NAH, but it sounds like you\u2019ve missed out on good things because of your fear of even the *possibility* of being near a dog. That\u2019s no way to live.", "NTA\n\nIf you aren't comfortable around dogs, then you are correct, this party likely would have been rough on you.\n\nBUT as a general rule, and I am surprised you have not learned this yet in your life - looooots of people side-eye someone who says they \"don't like dogs.\" Heck, some people even still give people who say they are afraid of dogs a hard time, but even that would be more socially acceptable.  Telling people you didn't go to a party because you dislike dogs is basically like telling people you sit in your basement plotting a mass murder.\n\nWhich is silly, who cares, etc etc.  But in terms of not starting off on the wrong foot at work - next time, just say you already had another commitment and leave it at that.", "NTA but please stop explaining things to your coworkers. You didn't go to the party. If they asked why you just say a family thing came up and leave it at that. I learned long ago that coworkers aren't friends and the less info you give them to talk about the better off you'll be.", "NTA.\n\nYou RSVP\u2019d.\n\nI\u2019m a dog person and I understand that not everyone is. The Halloween party I was at on Sat had tons of doggos and it was fun. You would have hated it. \n\nBut much like not liking kids, saying you don\u2019t like dogs will get some peoples\u2019s hair up. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would have just said that you had a prior obligation.", "NTA.  You don't need to give people an explanation.", "NTA. The party said it was dog friendly, and you don't like dogs so you didn't go. That's completely fine.", "NTA but a little white lie could have saved you a headache here.", "NTA\n\nGently, is this \"just a job\" or are you career building? If building your career, you need to weigh your level of discomfort against positive office politics. All these folks mentioning the anti-dog-side-eye-thing are for real. Double gently, next time your real reason is dog anxiety, have a little white lie prepared if rudely pressed.\n\nNo way AH territory.", "NTA.", "NTA for not going - but generally speaking, it does look bad if the new person doesn\u2019t show up to the boss\u2019s party even if you just show your face for a half hour and leave. It\u2019s like an unwritten rule.", "NTA. It's hard for people to understand things that they don't understand, if that makes sense. Maybe it's worth going next year and maybe you can have a good time without having to even go near dogs. You could always just leave if it's not working for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
