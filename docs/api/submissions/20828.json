They have 3 girls (12, 5 and 3). My brother was definitely one of \u201cthose\u201d husbands who worked, came home, played with the kids, but that was it. His wife ran the show: chores, raising the kids, making sure they went to school and activities, all the cooking, etc. All on top of her own full time job. She died quite unexpectedly and to say he was loss is an understatement.\n\nSo, I stepped in to help. Some may call it enabling, but it was that or my nieces would suffer. They do their part around the house (what\u2019s appropriate for their ages, obviously). I\u2019ve been trying to teach my brother to do the rest. I understand he just suffered a massive loss and a lot of his inability to learn, I put on grief. But as we close in on 14 months since her passing, he definitely has just used me to replace his wife in all ways domestic.\n\nI\u2019ve tried talking to him about it before and he\u2019d pull the \u201cmy wife just died\u201d card. Again, on me that I let it slide. \n\nMy final straw was when I went on a work trip. Came back to chaos. The house was cleaned, because the girls did more than their fair share. Obviously they should have chores but by his own admission, he did nothing despite having the time to. Oldest told me she was the one making sure the little ones went  to school/daycare. She\u2019s done all the cooking. She had to give up an end of the year dance because my brother asked her to watch the girls so he could go out with friends.\n\nI had a come to Jesus meeting and told him he needs to get his shit together. I\u2019m doing one more \u201ctutorial\u201d day and that\u2019s it. He needs to either hire a housekeeper or nanny (he can afford both) if he\u2019s not interested in doing his share of the chores or taking the kids anywhere. He needs to get a calendar to remind himself when stuff needs to get done. I said it was this or the girls come stay with me until he gets his act together.\n\nHe started on the whole \u201cI just lost my wife\u201d stuff again and I pointed out the girls lost their mother, and now it\u2019s like they lost their dad too. He asked if I was calling him a bad dad and I didn\u2019t answer, which pissed him off. He said as family I should be willing to help. I said I\u2019d help but I\u2019m not his wife.\n\nNow the girls are staying with me. My family says I should\u2019ve kept helping him vs berate him and that I\u2019m heartless for not being empathetic enough. They added it\u2019s my fault the girls are missing their dad because I gave him the ultimatum and if I just kept helping, they\u2019d still see him. It seems no one is on my side.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687979230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14li4b3/aita_for_not_letting_my_brother_hide_behind_the/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have no siblings or family on my side (my choic eon the family part that's another story) so if my fianc\u00e9e passed on me suddenly and we had kids ( We don't yet but we do have a cat) I would have no help from my family at all and would have to still take care of my kids.\n\n2) What would happen if the tables turned and he passed instead of his wife. Do you think she would just stop taking care of the girls due to grief? No of course she wouldn't. \n\nAfter losing my bestfriend and my grandfather (basically my dad because he was the only good adult in my childhood) I ended up living my car and I learned something that's going to seem cruel but needs to be said and understood.  When someone passes, your world may pause but the entire world does not. You don't stop going to work, you don't stop paying bills you can't just do nothing otherwise it's going to cause more troubles then just grieving.   If he wants to go out with his friends then he has the effort available to ATLEAST stay home with the kids he helped bring into this world. \n\nYou need to tell him you will contact CPS and take legal custody of his kids if he can't be a GOOD father to them, that way you atleast have documented help and the ability to fully take care of those girls. I don't think he will seriously make any changes and will keep using you as his new wife until he is slapped in the face with the real world, sometimes a legal slap. Seems minor right now with helping with chores but I worry what if something emergency happens and you have to take one of them to a doctor or worst? Does he even know what their socials are or any of their health information?\n\nScrew the family that doesn't see the issue. They aren't the ones taking care of the kids currently and they aren't paying you so they don't get a say.", "NTA\n\nEven if he is still grieving, he has kids to take care of.  If he can't handle taking care of them, he needs to let someone else do it.\n\nHe does need therapy, though, if he is still grieving.", "NTA\n\n\nBrother is. As is the family that continues to enable him.", "NTA! Good grief, sorry you're not getting more support.\n\nI had to laugh about the \"girls missing their dad\" and pinning that on you. All he has to do is hire help and they'd return to him!\n\nPaul McCartney's mother died when he was in his early teens. He had a younger brother. Suddenly his father was now stuck with looking after him, whereas before it had been his wife's responsibility. His sisters would come over to help, but they had families of their own to look after too. So Paul's dad Jim stepped up and learned how to do everything a wife was expected to do. He learned to cook. He learned to sew and iron. Etc. All while having a fulltime job himself. He was devastated by his wife's death. But had to pull himself together for the sake of his sons.\n\nYou did not \"berate\" your brother. You told him he had to pull himself together and if he wasn't capable of it, hire someone to do so, which you say he can afford. He's lucky no one reported him to Child Protective Services.\n\nIf your family thinks you should be empathetic, let *them* help your brother!", "NAH. Look, he's going to process that at whatever pace he needs to. I'm sure it isn't easy. You're correct that he needs to step up. He should step up for his children not for you though. Part of being a good parent is keeping at it even when it's hard. Because they need you. He needs to do that part of it. You're fine to be over this. It's only fair because you've rowed the boat enough.", "YTA.  Sounds like brother and the kids need grief therapy to work through their emotions.  Rather than berating him and giving him an ultimatum, show some empathy and help steer him toward healing.", "If the chikdreb are staying with you after this, it sounds like he is unable/unwilling to parent, and that is a huge deal.\n\nIf you or other family can care for them, great.\n\nIf not, a call to social services may be in order.\n\nYes, he is allowed to grieve as long as he needs to grieve, but the children still need to be looked after.\n\nNTA", "And where exactly are all the flying monkeys in this, 'Help the grieving Dad out' scenario? Oh nowhere - they just want you to do it all and they sit back and criticise.", "People will either work with their grief or just use their grief as leverage. You\u2019re not an asshole. Dad is a grown man that needs to get his shit together before he loses the relationship with daughter.", "NTA. You helped him for 14 months. That is more than enough. You're right, he is taking advantage of you and you are enabling his behavior. Good for you for finally putting your foot down, and shame on him for allowing his oldest daughter to be a better 'parent' than him.", "Nta, let them go clean his house", "You should know by now, if you've been reading this site, that whenever anyone stops being exploited by a relative, all the other relatives pile on the innocent party in favor of the exploiter. It seems they just love to attack, but only if they're going after the good guy. There's no point in attacking the bad guy: he already knows he's bad and relishes it.\n\nTell those berating you that if they feel that way they can come and be his housekeeper themselves.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. One question, if your family finds you \"heartless\" and everything, why aren't they 'helping\" him instead?", "NTA so on top of losing their mother, the children have to deal with an incompetent father who clearly doesn\u2019t care much about them.\n\n> Oldest told me she was the one making sure the little ones went to school/daycare. She\u2019s done all the cooking. She had to give up an end of the year dance because my brother asked her to watch the girls so he could go out with friends.\n\nFather of the year.", "He gave up his kids to you but your family thinks your are the problem? NTA, those poor kids.", "NTA!!  Brother won\u2019t grow up until he feels the consequences. Maybe not even then. I wonder if something besides grief and entitlement is going on. Drugs or booze?", "Nta its time for him to seek therapy too.", ">Oldest told me she was the one making sure the little ones went to school/daycare. She\u2019s done all the cooking. She had to give up an end of the year dance because my brother asked her to watch the girls so he could go out with friends.\n\n\nWTAF \n\nHe left a 12 year old in charge of 2 younger siblings so he could go out with his mates?  \n\n>My family says I should\u2019ve kept helping him vs berate him \n\nTell your family he's guilty of neglecting his kids!\n\n>my wife just died\u201d\n\nYeah, 3 little girls lost their mother, step up, and be a decent father!\n\nNTA  for you but your brother is a major AH and so are your family for enabling his neglect of his children. \n\nIt's a good job those kids have you to stand for them", "NTA. He will keep using you for as long as he can. Anyone defending him can take your place and do everything for him.", "NTA. It\u2019s good that the girls have you to step up for them at this stage of their lives. I cannot imagine losing my spouse and I know I\u2019d barely be able to keep my shit together, but the priority needs to be the children. He needs to get into a routine where he can be the dad those girls deserve. Therapy, a nanny, cleaners, etc.", "I don\u2019t know where all these deadbeat dads come from, but DAMN! He needs to get his shit together and stop his self pity, Your not the ass!", "NAH - he's still grieving and you are worn out and fed up. Help him hire a nanny since he seems to be unable to do so right now. \n\nThe kids need their dad and you need your sanity.", "NTA, and if the kids are staying with you, you should be getting some child support. As you said, your brother can afford it, so feel free to get a lawyer if you feel like it. Or ask all these harassing family members if they're willing to pay for the care of, or take care of the children themselves.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't his wife, and his OLDEST DAUGHTER isn't his wife either. He needs to step up and be an adult rather than depending on others taking on his adulting for him.\n\nHim putting the 12yo basically in charge while you were gone was highly inappropriate, and long-term would have likely resulted in CPS involvement.", "Geesh, that's a lot. NTA. You made things clear. You don't need to decide if he's a bad dad or not, this situation is not one that needs to make that definition. However, right now it's clear he is still dealing with the loss of his wife - per his remarks - and since his kids can't live in lingo long term, their needs to be addressed. If your family feels it should've been handled differently, then they're welcome to carry out those ideas on their own. The girls were missing their dad even when they were living there. He knows the rules for having them returned; so any delay in that happening is on his shoulders. Quite honestly, you're going above and beyond by taking the girls with you instead of just leaving them at his house under his limited care.", "Help him with one last task...hiring help. Send his kids back to him. NTA.", "NTA, I feel for him and the kids but he needs ti step up fir their sake. You aren't the asshole you're giving him tough love.", "He expect you do do two households on your own ??? It's not like you don't have your own laundry , your own cleaning etc to do beside working and whatever you have to do.\n\nThe main problem is that he somehow grew up that women have to take care of the house and the kids . It's his mindset and you saved the 12 years old to become a mom . If family and friends complain then tell them help . the burden should not lie on you and esp not on the girls . He would continue forcing the oldest to do all the jobs he suppose to do he forced her to give up on school stuff for him to hang out with his friends .What about her childhood ?", "NTA. So when faced with actually parenting his children he sent them home with you? As you said, his kids just lost their mother, yet he expects them to take on more responsibility than himself. I get that he's grieving, but the adult in the house has to pull themselves together and run the house and be the parent they signed up to be. That's their job. Also, you are still helping, just not in a way where your brother doesn't face consequences for his (in)actions.", "NTA. Your brother has obviously had a massive shock. You sound like an amazing sister helping him out. While the grieving process takes a long time, I think it was time for a \"come.to Jesus\" conversation.", "NTA.\n\nSympathies to him for having lost his wife, of course. Grief is always rough.\n\nThat said: You are not \"heartless\" for not doing all this stuff for him. If your family are so sure that someone needs to do this, then there's only one thing for it: They can sub in as housekeeper for a week on top of their other obligations. See how \\*they\\* feel about it. And then when they inevitably can't deal with it, ask them why they're being \"so heartless\".\n\nThe thing is, if it was a family perspective that he needs all the help: Why don't they offer to fill in on certain days, even? Sounds like they know exactly where you're coming from - they just want it to be you over any of them.", "You spent 14 months helping him learn the ropes. Everyone grieves differently, so knowing how the sudden loss impacted him is impossible, but he is a parent. Most parents realize they need to step up to help their children, but he did not do that. Instead, he willingly used you as a fill-in and relied too heavily on his children to do the rest. NTA.", "Don't you dare back down. NTA.  \n\nI feel for your brother losing his wife. The kids have lost their mother and now their childhood. He is a shit father. Letting them parent each other is disgusting.  There for the easy stuff but checks out for the hard stuff.  This pisses me off.", "nta... the girls lost a mom, you lost a sister in law...what does losing a wife have to do with keeping your house in order and your girls taken care of?", "So much NTA. That man needed a come to Jesus meeting. Being a widower doesn't mean he's not a parent.", "I have tried that. It didn\u2019t work. We had several other gentler conversations, which I say in my post.", "So you think op didn't do more than their fair share of helping out?  They did way more than a lot of people would have, and op's brother needed the reality check.  He's allowed to grief, but he has kids to take care of, and he's not doing nearly enough himself to make sure his grief doesn't affect his kids.  Grief therapy would be good for sure, but it's not going to work if op's brother doesn't want to put the work in.\n\nHis wife died, that sucks hard, but what's important now is that the kids are in a safe environment, and op did more than enough to make that happen.\n\nNTA", "She did. For 14 months.", "She can\u2019t force him to get therapy. Is she supposed to raise his children in his home indefinitely?", "Yeah, they\u2019ve used the fact that I\u2019m single and childless that I have time to do it. The rest have families, so they \u201cdon\u2019t have time\u201d.", "They claim to be too busy.", "He doesn\u2019t want the kids. I\u2019m not sending them back to be neglected emotionally.", "Our mom definitely enabled him. Our dad was the same type of dad, so this is just \u201cthe norm\u201d for him.", "No one said anything about forcing him to get therapy or raising his children indefinitely.  OP just needs to take a better approach on this.", "Of course.", "Yikes. He needs some grief counseling. Would he join a grief group?  Good of you to step in, but can you keep this up for 15 years?", "This commenter actually said just that.", "No, he won\u2019t do that. He has flat out refused everything."]}
