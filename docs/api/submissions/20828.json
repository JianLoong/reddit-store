They have 3 girls (12, 5 and 3). My brother was definitely one of \u201cthose\u201d husbands who worked, came home, played with the kids, but that was it. His wife ran the show: chores, raising the kids, making sure they went to school and activities, all the cooking, etc. All on top of her own full time job. She died quite unexpectedly and to say he was loss is an understatement.\n\nSo, I stepped in to help. Some may call it enabling, but it was that or my nieces would suffer. They do their part around the house (what\u2019s appropriate for their ages, obviously). I\u2019ve been trying to teach my brother to do the rest. I understand he just suffered a massive loss and a lot of his inability to learn, I put on grief. But as we close in on 14 months since her passing, he definitely has just used me to replace his wife in all ways domestic.\n\nI\u2019ve tried talking to him about it before and he\u2019d pull the \u201cmy wife just died\u201d card. Again, on me that I let it slide. \n\nMy final straw was when I went on a work trip. Came back to chaos. The house was cleaned, because the girls did more than their fair share. Obviously they should have chores but by his own admission, he did nothing despite having the time to. Oldest told me she was the one making sure the little ones went  to school/daycare. She\u2019s done all the cooking. She had to give up an end of the year dance because my brother asked her to watch the girls so he could go out with friends.\n\nI had a come to Jesus meeting and told him he needs to get his shit together. I\u2019m doing one more \u201ctutorial\u201d day and that\u2019s it. He needs to either hire a housekeeper or nanny (he can afford both) if he\u2019s not interested in doing his share of the chores or taking the kids anywhere. He needs to get a calendar to remind himself when stuff needs to get done. I said it was this or the girls come stay with me until he gets his act together.\n\nHe started on the whole \u201cI just lost my wife\u201d stuff again and I pointed out the girls lost their mother, and now it\u2019s like they lost their dad too. He asked if I was calling him a bad dad and I didn\u2019t answer, which pissed him off. He said as family I should be willing to help. I said I\u2019d help but I\u2019m not his wife.\n\nNow the girls are staying with me. My family says I should\u2019ve kept helping him vs berate him and that I\u2019m heartless for not being empathetic enough. They added it\u2019s my fault the girls are missing their dad because I gave him the ultimatum and if I just kept helping, they\u2019d still see him. It seems no one is on my side.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: comments telling me to send those girls back and let cps get involved if he doesn\u2019t get better will not be entertained. That\u2019s not punishing them, it\u2019s hurting the girls.

I have no siblings or family on my side (my choic eon the family part that's another story) so if my fianc\u00e9e passed on me suddenly and we had kids ( We don't yet but we do have a cat) I would have no help from my family at all and would have to still take care of my kids.\n\n2) What would happen if the tables turned and he passed instead of his wife. Do you think she would just stop taking care of the girls due to grief? No of course she wouldn't. \n\nAfter losing my bestfriend and my grandfather (basically my dad because he was the only good adult in my childhood) I ended up living my car and I learned something that's going to seem cruel but needs to be said and understood.  When someone passes, your world may pause but the entire world does not. You don't stop going to work, you don't stop paying bills you can't just do nothing otherwise it's going to cause more troubles then just grieving.   If he wants to go out with his friends then he has the effort available to ATLEAST stay home with the kids he helped bring into this world. \n\nYou need to tell him you will contact CPS and take legal custody of his kids if he can't be a GOOD father to them, that way you atleast have documented help and the ability to fully take care of those girls. I don't think he will seriously make any changes and will keep using you as his new wife until he is slapped in the face with the real world, sometimes a legal slap. Seems minor right now with helping with chores but I worry what if something emergency happens and you have to take one of them to a doctor or worst? Does he even know what their socials are or any of their health information?\n\nScrew the family that doesn't see the issue. They aren't the ones taking care of the kids currently and they aren't paying you so they don't get a say.", "NTA\n\nEven if he is still grieving, he has kids to take care of.

Suddenly his father was now stuck with looking after him, whereas before it had been his wife's responsibility. His sisters would come over to help, but they had families of their own to look after too. So Paul's dad Jim stepped up and learned how to do everything a wife was expected to do. He learned to cook. He learned to sew and iron. Etc. All while having a fulltime job himself. He was devastated by his wife's death. But had to pull himself together for the sake of his sons.\n\nYou did not \"berate\" your brother. You told him he had to pull himself together and if he wasn't capable of it, hire someone to do so, which you say he can afford. He's lucky no one reported him to Child Protective Services.\n\nIf your family thinks you should be empathetic, let *them* help your brother!", "[deleted]", "YTA.

He needs to step up and be an adult rather than depending on others taking on his adulting for him.\n\nHim putting the 12yo basically in charge while you were gone was highly inappropriate, and long-term would have likely resulted in CPS involvement.", "Geesh, that's a lot. NTA. You made things clear. You don't need to decide if he's a bad dad or not, this situation is not one that needs to make that definition. However, right now it's clear he is still dealing with the loss of his wife - per his remarks - and since his kids can't live in lingo long term, their needs to be addressed. If your family feels it should've been handled differently, then they're welcome to carry out those ideas on their own. The girls were missing their dad even when they were living there. He knows the rules for having them returned; so any delay in that happening is on his shoulders.

You aren't the asshole you're giving him tough love.", "He expect you do do two households on your own ??? It's not like you don't have your own laundry , your own cleaning etc to do beside working and whatever you have to do.\n\nThe main problem is that he somehow grew up that women have to take care of the house and the kids . It's his mindset and you saved the 12 years old to become a mom . If family and friends complain then tell them help . the burden should not lie on you and esp not on the girls . He would continue forcing the oldest to do all the jobs he suppose to do he forced her to give up on school stuff for him to hang out with his friends .What about her childhood ?", "NTA. So when faced with actually parenting his children he sent them home with you? As you said, his kids just lost their mother, yet he expects them to take on more responsibility than himself. I get that he's grieving, but the adult in the house has to pull themselves together and run the house and be the parent they signed up to be. That's their job. Also, you are still helping, just not in a way where your brother doesn't face consequences for his (in)actions.", "NTA. Your brother has obviously had a massive shock. You sound like an amazing sister helping him out.

Grief is always rough.\n\nThat said: You are not \"heartless\" for not doing all this stuff for him. If your family are so sure that someone needs to do this, then there's only one thing for it: They can sub in as housekeeper for a week on top of their other obligations. See how \\*they\\* feel about it. And then when they inevitably can't deal with it, ask them why they're being \"so heartless\".\n\nThe thing is, if it was a family perspective that he needs all the help: Why don't they offer to fill in on certain days, even? Sounds like they know exactly where you're coming from - they just want it to be you over any of them.", "You spent 14 months helping him learn the ropes. Everyone grieves differently, so knowing how the sudden loss impacted him is impossible, but he is a parent. Most parents realize they need to step up to help their children, but he did not do that. Instead, he willingly used you as a fill-in and relied too heavily on his children to do the rest. NTA.", "Don't you dare back down. NTA.  \n\nI feel for your brother losing his wife.

We had several other gentler conversations, which I say in my post.", "So you think op didn't do more than their fair share of helping out?  They did way more than a lot of people would have, and op's brother needed the reality check.  He's allowed to grief, but he has kids to take care of, and he's not doing nearly enough himself to make sure his grief doesn't affect his kids.  Grief therapy would be good for sure, but it's not going to work if op's brother doesn't want to put the work in.\n\nHis wife died, that sucks hard, but what's important now is that the kids are in a safe environment, and op did more than enough to make that happen.\n\nNTA", "She did. For 14 months.", "She can\u2019t force him to get therapy. Is she supposed to raise his children in his home indefinitely?", "Yeah, they\u2019ve used the fact that I\u2019m single and childless that I have time to do it.

How much he has put on you OP is pathetic. I say this as someone well-acquainted with death. \n\nHe needs a grief counselor, and to come to terms with the fact that he was leeching off of his wife\u2019s labor. He doesn\u2019t pull his weight\u2014physically, emotionally, mentally. \n\nHe will mourn his deceased wife all his life, but he can no longer mourn his irresponsible lifestyle. He has to be a father now. Life is hard, but he is the adult here\u2014not his kids!\n\nI bet he will find a replacement wife as soon as possible, expecting her to do all the adult work again because of his ingrained misogyny.

My dad would not do a single task. I cooked, cleaned, did laundry, helped my siblings with school work, etc. I really lost out on my childhood becoming \"mom\" of the house because my dad was, to put it nicely, lazy. This has caused a strained relationship with my father and this was 20-ish years ago. You or the oldest daughter should not be in charge of the household. That is his job and his job alone.

I say let your nieces stay with you. \n\nI hate to be cynical, but realistically he's not going to get his act together.

Either way you are all these girls have got and you're doing the right thing holding onto them. NTA", "NTA You are 100% right he didn't just lose a wife, those girls lost their mother. Instead of stepping up and being a supportive dad to them, he made them support him. They deserve better. He can grieve and feel lost, but he can't make his daughters pay the price for it.  If he's still unable to do anything because of grief, he needs therapy. If he's just using it as an excuse, he needs a kick in the a$$ to get his act together. Either way, something needs to change.

Sorry for the terrible tragedy, no one deserves this. It is hard to judge a man who lost a wife and the mother of his kids, but it is really unfair for the girls, who lost their mom, to also lose their childhoods (arguably already somewhat gone) to do the chores your brother can\u2019t juggle with work. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, it sounds like he\u2019s in a pit of grief and doesn\u2019t have the autonomy to get back control of his life. Hopefully he can soon come to the realization and take on the parent role that the kids need. Sorry again for your loss and wishing you and your family the best.", "NTA. Is he in any type of grief counseling?", "NTA \nDeath is horrible, painful, and turns your life upside down. Nevertheless, life and the world around survivors marches on, and it is necessary to deal with it. If he can afford a nanny or a housekeeper, then he can probably afford a therapist if he needs help dealing with grief. There\u2019s a whole lot of single parents out there whether by death, divorce or abandonment who step up.

I don't understand how you are the only one who is picking up this responsibility and other people have the audacity to judge you about anything. \n\nObviously I feel bad for your brother. This is all terrible and has to be the worst time in his life. However he needs to acknowledge that he still has children and he can't just neglect them because he is grieving. You can grieve adn still be responsible.", "Agree.   CPS is not the way to go.  You're right to take the girls to let him figure out how to take care of himself.  He's clearly parentifying the eldest and taking total advantage of you.  You've done your piece.  Tell family with the tudes to go clean up after him themselves.", "NTA. You laid it all out for him, and he made his choice. You're doing what's best for your nieces. They matter most.\n\nYour family's attitude about how you're treating him is a big indicator of why he is the way he is. No one seems to expect him to pull his weight, despite the burden he's placing on his daughters.", "You\u2019re an amazing aunt, OP. Those girls are lucky to have you. \n\nMy mom died when I was 13. It was traumatic. I had a dad who was a lot like your brother. I really needed support, but he couldn\u2019t get out of his own way. My aunts didn\u2019t think it was their place to interfere, so it just went downhill. I moved out at 17, struggled to make my own way and resented not only my father but also my aunts for not intervening. He was a mess. They had no excuse. \n\nOP, you are NTA. You are providing much needed stability to those girls. Please make sure you are taking care of yourself too. Taking guardianship of 3 kids is a lot. You will need some respite too. It concerns me that your family support system is scapegoating you. Do you have others who can help you out? Is your brother providing for the girls financially?", "Yeah my dad was the same way. From the ages of ten plus I would cook him every meal, gave him a list for grocery shopping, help my younger brothers do the schoolwork, and all the laundry and cleaning. It was a heavy load, and I feel like he stole my childhood from my by his own weaponized incompetence. The killer is, after I left for college, my younger brothers had to do the same thing. Now that I\u2019m 25 and we are all living on our own, my dad struggles to take care of himself in almost every way. He tries to get me to pity him, but it\u2019s not working.

Natural deaths. And I ended up with a massive load of grief. I absolutely shattered. But I still managed to get up to do what I needed to do. Some days that's all I did. And I did it on auto pilot at that. But damnit, I did it. Doing those things often became the only way I had to get outside of myself for a bit. Your brother needs to game face it up.

If they are staying with you long term, you should try to get a letter from your brother giving you the right to get them medical treatment, etc. I have done letters like this for my kids when they traveled with their grandparents. Look up in loco parentis laws in your state. Make sure you have their health insurance cards, etc.\n\nIf I were you, and this continued long term without the father re-assuming responsibility, I would call the school district\u2019s social worker or school psychologist, particularly for the 12 year old. I would explain the situation and say that you are worried her education will suffer because she is being parentified, and that the young ones will suffer because they are being parented by a 12 year old. School social workers can help find grief counseling, family counseling, etc. Plus, they are a neutral 3rd party who can report to CPS if they feel there is actual neglect or abuse. It\u2019s possible that having to explain himself to someone who is not a family member will wake your brother up to reality.\n\nAnd bless that 12 year old.

He hasn\u2019t been a parent to those poor girls at all. Your family is enabling his toxic behaviour and in the end is doing far more harm than good. Good on you for stepping up and supporting the girls! \n\nHonestly, if he was truly grieving, I highly doubt he\u2019d be going out with friends so much. \n\nSue for custody and child support, protect those girls like you have been doing. \n\nNTA NTA NTA!", "Make sure you get child support.", "NTA \n\nBut\u2026what\u2019s your plan for these poor kids?

In which case, power & strength to you for doing something so noble and selfless. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for you for being in such a crap situation.

If the kids were a bit older I would have said the better move would have been to let him abuse them a bit longer then call CPS so you have more legal standing to protect those kids. But 3 years is way too young to survive that kind of neglect for long.\n\nThough next time don't be coy about him being a horrific parent. Let him have it. Really grind into him what a horrific person he is. How distressed his dead wife is looking down on her children suffering. Be cruel, be vicious, protect those children at all costs.", "NTA. Just because you won\u2019t call cps doesn\u2019t mean a teacher won\u2019t if they realise the situation", "You're right - NTA.\n\nBut aside from trying to teach him to parent, which is failing obviously (and I am NOT blaming you for that! You have clearly gone above & beyond). \n\nIs he getting other support aside from you? Is he in Grief therapy? Has he joined any berived parents groups?\n\nMaybe a more compassionate approach here **is** to take the girls for an extended stay with you, and tell him he has 6 months to get his shit together. He can hang out with them a couple of times a week to maintain his relationship without pressure there, but his real focus should be him for a little while.\n\nLet us assume the best about him, he truly IS swamped in grief still and basic functioning is beyond him, even with the motivation of caring for his kids - let's assume it IS an impossibility for him.\n\nFine. That's the reality. In that case, what is to be done about it? No amount of cajoling, begging, threats etc. are going to fix his core problem - the overwhelming grief. It is not uncommon for the surviving parent to sink so deeply into their grief they fail miserably at every other area beyond just surviving. \n\nSo that is the priority for him to work on, and **WORK ON**, not take advantage of you taking the girls for a while to sit on his ass at home and stare sadly at walls. He starts doing weekly grief therapy, with a solo therapist and possibly a group if that works for him (group therapy isn't for everyone and that's fair). He makes progress on grief management for a short while (3 months is usually a good time to allow for settling into a groove with therapy and starting to make the baby steps of real progress), he then starts reclaiming his home - whether this looks like hiring a housekeeper or doing it himself doesn't matter, the important thing is reclamation happens and structure is restored. \n\nThen the kids, he starts spending MINDFUL parenting time with them, rebuilding those relationships and re-investing himself in them as little people he ACTIVELY LOVES and who are part of him, not just little people who are under his feet needing stuff at home he just wants to keep quiet.\n\nOnce those pieces come together, he picks up the parenting again, the kids start living with him again, and he parents them in a healthy and appropriate way. Because right now that is clearly impossible for him. \n\nAnd if he still cannot at that time, it's time to think of the long term solutions for the girls and let him do whatever. \n\nAnd if he asks you if you think he's a bad dad in future, the answer is \"Right now? You are being a bad parent. The kids lost their mother. You're not the only one who lost someone vital here. Your kids need you to step up and parent - that means providing them a clean, safe and loving home - and if you cannot do it physically and emotionally yourself because of your grief, that is actually OK! That's hard to do immediately. \n\nBut then you NEED to provide alternatives for them so they can keep being kids and heal from this loss too. Hire a nanny or housekeeper to make sure the home is safe and clean, and spend more time with them just loving them without the pressure of house upkeep. \n\nBut what you do NOT do is you do NOT get your 12 yr old to become replacement mommy. That is forcing her to take the role of a parent, it's actually got a name, it's called parentification and it is such a shitty thing to do a child it is literally classified as abuse. So if you do that, then my answer will become YES, you are a bad father. \n\nYour grief is understandable, being overwhelmed is understandable... but you have resources to provide better for your kids AND yourself. Do better for them AND for you or they will leave when they're 18 and never look back because right now you are abandoning them when they need your love and care the most.\"\n\nGood luck, and thank you for stepping in to love those kids when they need it most.

This left me with three kids to raise (who at the time were 16, 10, and 7) by myself. My parents are long gone, and her family couldn't do much because of the quarantines. I had to step up and make sure they were fed, clothed, doing well in remote school, had appropriate chores, help them find hobbies, teach them to ride bikes, and so on. All of this happened while I was working full time (computer geek with a WFH gig).\n\nTo this day, their mom's family are almost completely uninvolved with them. I totally get that they may not want to deal with me very much, but my kids see the lack of attention and passive-aggressive comments from them. They've almost completely written off their mom's family due to this.\n\nIn January 2022 and I met someone through online dating. Nearly eighteen months later and we're still crazy about each other. My kids like her, and her kids like me. With both of our work schedule, a day on the weekend is usually all she and I get, but we make the most of it. We even get our families (parents, kids, and dogs) together periodically because they all have fun.\n\nu/drowningunder, your brother needs to get his fucking head out of his ass and grow up. If this 50 year old solo dad can have kids who are happy and comfortable enough to talk with me about anything (their mom, periods, gender questions, how to cook mac and cheese, etc.), plus a relationship, plus friends, then he really has no excuse for his actions. He's milking the situation for all it's worth so he doesn't have to step up.\n\nI'm glad you were able to take in his kids, but that's not a healthy long-term solution for you or them. I'm not sure how you can get him to wake up, especially when the rest of the family seems to be enabling him, but it's got to happen. Soon enough, his kids will see what kind of father he is, and they'll resent him for it.", "NTA OP, but get child support for those kids, before he gets used to having the extra money and freedom to spend it.", "Nta.

They're quick to offer your help, but not their own. That goes to show that they know exactly what your brother is like, and that he will continue to do this as long as you let him.

I was figuring everything out with my mom after my dad passed.\n\nI have my own family too, so I've been managing 2 households, basically. It's  beyond exhausted. \n\nI also understand the brain fog that grief brings, however. Your brother does have to find a way to pull himself up to take care of his girls and you can't continue to do all of that work but just a gentle reminder that it's much easier said than done. Unfortunately, grief isn't linear, and it doesn't have a timeline. \n\nI do agree that your brother needs to take over the reigns. Considering how hard it is to actually think and to make plans - maybe you can help initially organize a schedule for him? So he can see an example and do that for a bit (until any major changes happen) and get a feel for it. He will ultimately do everything but you help to set up the initial schedule and game plan, *with you*, you guys carve out an afternoon or some time to set the plans, and then he takes over? Just a suggestion. It's kind of what I've done with my mom. I've basically spent the last year living with her part-time, and now I've been going less and less as some things have settled. \n\nJust because it really is so hard to think. Even though your brother does need to be doing more now and can't keep falling back on his grief as a reason forever, it doesn't mean that actually doing it makes it any easier. It's not necessarily laziness (idk maybe it is) but more of an actual inability and mental block because the grief literally fogs your brain and just short circuits any original thoughts that weren't already a habit (like completing tasks at work). So maybe help to set up an initial game plan with him as you step away when you do bring the girls back.\n\nAnd to those suggesting CPS - I am truly sorry. Your brother may be lacking, but he also knows that he's had a trusted source (you) to help them. This is not neglect as we see as typical child abuse.

F*** em, I'll just keep the family I like.", "> You\u2019re absolutely right, he didnt just lose his wife\n\nIn another way too: He didn't _just_ lose his wife, he lost her _over a year ago!_\n\nI mean, sure, he can still mourn her. But it's really high time for him to get his shit together.", "To be fair to my uncle, I'm pretty sure it was 80% fear of losing his big sister, and he probably would have dragged my father out of bed even more aggressively if it was my mother who died.\n\nBut yeah, in general this is definitely because he's a widower father, and a widowed mother would absolutely be expected to ignore her needs.", "Once a year at most. It's the end of year dance, and it's pretty unusual to start having something like a homecoming or Fall Dance in 6-7th grade. Neither my kids nor I did at that age, it was only in High School that we sometimes had 2 school dances in a year, unless you were invited to one by someone in another year, but then it wasn't your class's dance.", "You're not wrong, but it screams crushing depression and escapism. He's got to better but he needs professional help.", "Hopefully. I've heard horror stories about foster care.", "Because most of us are raised to be accommodating, despite everything else, including our own discomfort. It\u2019s why we make such ideal victims. \ud83d\ude10\n\nExample: A few weeks ago, I was at the laundromat: noise-canceling headphones on, and working on a personal project while I waited for my shit to dry. I had some random dude tap me on the shoulder and demand to know how to use the dryers. He didn\u2019t ask. He **demanded.**\n\nI said: \u201cDude, I don\u2019t work here,\u201d and he replied: \u201cAw, you ain\u2019t doin\u2019 *nothin\u2019.* \n\nSo I sarcastically told him to press the green button to start the machine and put my headphones on while maintaining eye contact. A clear indication that I didn\u2019t want to be bothered (or so I thought.) A few minutes later, another tap, this time to ask which coin slot he should use. I (again, unfortunately) engaged and said it was clearly marked: quarters on the left, dollar coins on the right. \n\nI was simmering with irritation\u2014 then he, yet again, tapped me on the shoulder. I immediately got aggressive and in his face. I pulled my headphones off and stood up so quickly, it made him step back. I barked out \u201cWHAT?!\u201d like I was a fuckin\u2019 drill sergeant. He said \u201cI just wanted to thank you..\u201d in the smallest voiced and walked to the other side of the room. If you wanted to thank me so much, random laundry dude, you should clearly have left me the fuck alone!! I just wanted to listen to my audiobook and work on my artwork\u2014 however, I have a vagina, so I\u2019m *clearly* more experienced at doing laundry! \n\nAnd as shitty as the whole thing was, I *still* had to talk myself out of feeling guilty. Like it was my responsibility to coddle this dumbfuck\u2019s feelings, and help him navigate something that, by all accounts, he *should know how to do!* If he didn\u2019t know, there were plenty of people around who are actually paid to help! But no. I was conveniently close. He could have asked the guy sitting at the next closest table, scrolling on his phone.. but that\u2019s ludicrous, right? Because he\u2019s a man, and of course he can\u2019t be expected to help! \ud83d\ude44\n\nThat kind of instinct to plaster a smile on my face, be innately helpful, and \u2018just be nice so he goes away\u2019 runs SO deep. I\u2019ve been fighting against it for my entire adult life\u2014 and, despite knowing logically that I owe a stranger NOTHING, I still feel an innate sense of discomfort\u2026 like I\u2019m somehow wrong by saying no and asserting my rights.", "In fairness they also raised Saint OP", "It's like caring for an aging relative (you know, especially with Alzheimer's or dementia, etc), the other family members whine and complain about how the caretaker Is Doing It All Wrong but never ever does anything to help. Complaining is free. Taking care of kids/elders/etc isn't, and is *hard*.", "That was a very smart idea on the family's part", "as long as OP is okay with that, it's probably the best option.", "On the plus side: if she gets custody, the girls won't be left in charge of all the housework and he'll need to pay child support.", "Fucking hell im so sorry\u2026. I don\u2019t even know what you could to do to help without just enabling him at this point. I hope his kids don\u2019t learn that he doesn\u2019t want them", "Awesome story. I will adopt this attitude!", "Why can\u2019t everyone in society just be a little kinder to each other? You were in a public place and a guy asked you how to use a machine, takes 30 seconds out of your day and helps someone out. Instead of helping him and maybe feeling like you did a good deed you got angry and you\u2019re still thinking about it a few weeks later. Maybe he asked you cause you\u2019re a girl and he\u2019s a misogynist. Maybe it\u2019s cause you were closest and he\u2019s lazy. Maybe it\u2019s just because you seem like a good person. I get asked for directions frequently, just have one of those faces. Assuming everyone around you is acting with malice and has bad intentions is a good way to stay perpetually angry and paranoid.", "Or they parentified OP while letting her brother do whatever he wants, which is why he is a trash father.", "Not if the girls continue living with her", "Bro, read again. I've explained this so. Many. Times.", "Based on their family's reaction I'm guessing he was like that growing up as well. Mom probably took care of everything and that was normalized enough in their family that his sister naturally jumped in to do what their mom would have. But she's realizing just how bullshit that dynamic is.", "OP's brother sounds like a lifelong narcissist, whose lack of interest was masked by his wife doing all the parenting for him. Now that she's gone, so is his ability to mask it. It's one thing to not do any housework, it's another to not care at all about the happiness of the children and their ability to go to a school dance or participate in their lives fully because of his actions. That's a level of self-entitlement beyond being lazy.", "CPS has been called on both my parents, they were divorced and fucked up for different reasons. I totally felt like they made it worse but CPS is a LOT better than they used to be. I ended up working for them as an adult. It isn't perfect but they tend to place kids with a family member if anyone is willing and sounds like OP is so she will likely just be legally recognized as their temporary guardian while dad gets a nanny or his shit together. \n\nIf they can't work this out soon, CPS involvement will likely become inevitable. Usually better to be proactive with them than reactive. But hopefully they work this out before it gets there.", "That very well may be the case. His stubborn resistance to hiring a nanny can, on the other hand, be worked on. \n\nThen he can return to being the \u201cfun\u201d dad, albeit a bit more poor.", "We have no obligation to be kind to those who aren't kind to us. That's exactly the attitude she's talking about. That guy *could* have been kind enough to leave someone who's obviously involved in something - with headphones on - alone and unbothered, while he goes to ask the person whose JOB it is to help him. He decided to be lazy/rude/misogynistic/*it doesn't matter what* and you want him to never learn to be any better than that because OP is just supposed to 'be kinder' to him anyway. Eff that.\n\nThe kindness can start with HIM, instead.", "Yeah gotta agree with you here... That other person actually comes off as an asshole. Been in the same position as a male, where someone is annoying me and asking questions when I have headphones in... Not really a gender thing, some people are just a little oblivious. But a thank you at the end is all I need to feel good, as opposed to simmering/feeling abused for a long while after.", "I'm not sure that it matters much to me, but I totally read this story as if OP was a man, and your comment confused me initially. I was just putting myself in the shoes of the OP.\n\nParentification is so screwed up and girls and young women absolutely take the brunt of it", "All of this. \nAnd then tell him he is losing his daughters too, because when a parent is not there for kids, they get cut off by the kids very soon. If he wants any chance of having a good relationship with them, he needs to step up. \nBut if his priority is still hanging out with friends, tell him to give you child support money. \n\nI am pretty sure he will find another lady and just drop him on the girls, which will just add to their misery. What a terrible excuse of fatherhood.\nNTA.", "No, he'll still need someone to cook and clean for him and manage his calendar. And he'll spin some sob story that makes OP look cruel and conniving, and him just a poor lonely widower who had his children stolen from him in his darkest hours.", "At 12, there's usually only 1 dance a year, if that. \n\nThe amount of cooking and having to get younger kids to school she is doing gives \"child with no sober parent in the home\" vibes. Now, there are some cultures where the eldest girl, in particular, may function in this way in a family, especially with a single mom who works long hours, but she usually gets trained by her mom in real cooking skills she takes pride in developing, and she also gains more privileges as a result of caring for her siblings.\n\nIf oldest daughter also gets a night out with friends, I'm not seeing it.", "Not sure why you're being downvoted. I also have depression and you're absolutely right.\n\nHe probably does have depression. But he also needs to be responsible for getting himself help so he can manage it better, and making sure his kids have the support they need one way or another while he learns how to manage his depression and the responsibilities of being a parent. The problem is that he didn't put in the work to figure this out while OP was helping him earlier. \n\nI'm glad that OP is taking care of the kids but having her brother go to therapy and some parenting classes should be a condition of this, along with him offering financial support. Otherwise she will either need to get legal guardianship/custody or contact CPS so they can figure out a suitable home (which would probably be OP anyway).", "It sounds like he was an entitled, self-absorbed AH before his wife died and now he's an entitled, self-absorbed AH with possible depression.\n\nOP is definitely NTA & might qualify for sainthood.\n\nBut she should definitely be getting those girls what they're entitled to financially for support as well.  Kids are expensive & OP's family should not have to take that on any more than necessary.", "No child should have to miss an important event in order to make up for their parents laziness and neglect. The poor twelve year old is doing everything that is not related to economics, on top of her regular responsibilities at school and with friends! I bet this father has pulled the \u201cI make the money and feed you\u201d card to his children.", "Hell, CPS got involved over my nieces being abused by their father, and all they did was *tell him exactly what the girls told them*. Would have been 100x better if they had just done nothing.", "CPS varies wildly from state to state, county to county, and even city to city. It really depends on their workload and how much the workers care. You can't assume they're better based on your experiences unfortunately.", "He can agree in court to add her as a guardian. Nothing adversarial about it. It gives her the legal right to act when there is no time to go get a consent form. It's just smart planning.", "I doubt any prosecutor would come after her for kidnapping (especially given that he presumably let her take the kids). But yeah, them staying with her for a few nights or a week is one thing, after that it's no longer a visit.", "I suspect it is ease and contempt, not pride, that keeps him from hiring a nanny and/or housekeeper.\n\nAfter all, why should he pay someone to do these tasks when OP is doing it for free?  He probably doesn't even consider it to be \"work\" worth respect or payment.\n\nI fear the husband will be recalcitrant, not seeing the value in the care OP is providing, or the need to ensure she can manage it properly.  Which actually makes getting the legal status of the children line up with their actual living situation, he can pretend he's being the active, doting father who is being done wrong by OP's interference, rather than the neglectful parent ignored the care of his children.", "I'm being downvoted because people don't want to read. Pretty typical here unfortunately.", "The best option at this juncture.", "Relatives are responsible for most amber alerts. I wouldn\u2019t be too trusting of prosecutors here."]}
