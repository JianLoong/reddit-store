They have 3 girls (12, 5 and 3). My brother was definitely one of \u201cthose\u201d husbands who worked, came home, played with the kids, but that was it. His wife ran the show: chores, raising the kids, making sure they went to school and activities, all the cooking, etc. All on top of her own full time job. She died quite unexpectedly and to say he was loss is an understatement.\n\nSo, I stepped in to help. Some may call it enabling, but it was that or my nieces would suffer. They do their part around the house (what\u2019s appropriate for their ages, obviously). I\u2019ve been trying to teach my brother to do the rest. I understand he just suffered a massive loss and a lot of his inability to learn, I put on grief. But as we close in on 14 months since her passing, he definitely has just used me to replace his wife in all ways domestic.\n\nI\u2019ve tried talking to him about it before and he\u2019d pull the \u201cmy wife just died\u201d card. Again, on me that I let it slide. \n\nMy final straw was when I went on a work trip. Came back to chaos. The house was cleaned, because the girls did more than their fair share. Obviously they should have chores but by his own admission, he did nothing despite having the time to. Oldest told me she was the one making sure the little ones went  to school/daycare. She\u2019s done all the cooking. She had to give up an end of the year dance because my brother asked her to watch the girls so he could go out with friends.\n\nI had a come to Jesus meeting and told him he needs to get his shit together. I\u2019m doing one more \u201ctutorial\u201d day and that\u2019s it. He needs to either hire a housekeeper or nanny (he can afford both) if he\u2019s not interested in doing his share of the chores or taking the kids anywhere. He needs to get a calendar to remind himself when stuff needs to get done. I said it was this or the girls come stay with me until he gets his act together.\n\nHe started on the whole \u201cI just lost my wife\u201d stuff again and I pointed out the girls lost their mother, and now it\u2019s like they lost their dad too. He asked if I was calling him a bad dad and I didn\u2019t answer, which pissed him off. He said as family I should be willing to help. I said I\u2019d help but I\u2019m not his wife.\n\nNow the girls are staying with me. My family says I should\u2019ve kept helping him vs berate him and that I\u2019m heartless for not being empathetic enough. They added it\u2019s my fault the girls are missing their dad because I gave him the ultimatum and if I just kept helping, they\u2019d still see him. It seems no one is on my side.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: comments telling me to send those girls back and let cps get involved if he doesn\u2019t get better will not be entertained. That\u2019s not punishing them, it\u2019s hurting the girls.

I have no siblings or family on my side (my choic eon the family part that's another story) so if my fianc\u00e9e passed on me suddenly and we had kids ( We don't yet but we do have a cat) I would have no help from my family at all and would have to still take care of my kids.\n\n2) What would happen if the tables turned and he passed instead of his wife. Do you think she would just stop taking care of the girls due to grief? No of course she wouldn't. \n\nAfter losing my bestfriend and my grandfather (basically my dad because he was the only good adult in my childhood) I ended up living my car and I learned something that's going to seem cruel but needs to be said and understood.  When someone passes, your world may pause but the entire world does not. You don't stop going to work, you don't stop paying bills you can't just do nothing otherwise it's going to cause more troubles then just grieving.   If he wants to go out with his friends then he has the effort available to ATLEAST stay home with the kids he helped bring into this world. \n\nYou need to tell him you will contact CPS and take legal custody of his kids if he can't be a GOOD father to them, that way you atleast have documented help and the ability to fully take care of those girls. I don't think he will seriously make any changes and will keep using you as his new wife until he is slapped in the face with the real world, sometimes a legal slap. Seems minor right now with helping with chores but I worry what if something emergency happens and you have to take one of them to a doctor or worst? Does he even know what their socials are or any of their health information?\n\nScrew the family that doesn't see the issue. They aren't the ones taking care of the kids currently and they aren't paying you so they don't get a say.", "NTA\n\nEven if he is still grieving, he has kids to take care of.

Suddenly his father was now stuck with looking after him, whereas before it had been his wife's responsibility. His sisters would come over to help, but they had families of their own to look after too. So Paul's dad Jim stepped up and learned how to do everything a wife was expected to do. He learned to cook. He learned to sew and iron. Etc. All while having a fulltime job himself. He was devastated by his wife's death. But had to pull himself together for the sake of his sons.\n\nYou did not \"berate\" your brother. You told him he had to pull himself together and if he wasn't capable of it, hire someone to do so, which you say he can afford. He's lucky no one reported him to Child Protective Services.\n\nIf your family thinks you should be empathetic, let *them* help your brother!", "[deleted]", "YTA.

He needs to step up and be an adult rather than depending on others taking on his adulting for him.\n\nHim putting the 12yo basically in charge while you were gone was highly inappropriate, and long-term would have likely resulted in CPS involvement.", "Geesh, that's a lot. NTA. You made things clear. You don't need to decide if he's a bad dad or not, this situation is not one that needs to make that definition. However, right now it's clear he is still dealing with the loss of his wife - per his remarks - and since his kids can't live in lingo long term, their needs to be addressed. If your family feels it should've been handled differently, then they're welcome to carry out those ideas on their own. The girls were missing their dad even when they were living there. He knows the rules for having them returned; so any delay in that happening is on his shoulders.

You aren't the asshole you're giving him tough love.", "He expect you do do two households on your own ??? It's not like you don't have your own laundry , your own cleaning etc to do beside working and whatever you have to do.\n\nThe main problem is that he somehow grew up that women have to take care of the house and the kids . It's his mindset and you saved the 12 years old to become a mom . If family and friends complain then tell them help . the burden should not lie on you and esp not on the girls . He would continue forcing the oldest to do all the jobs he suppose to do he forced her to give up on school stuff for him to hang out with his friends .What about her childhood ?", "NTA. So when faced with actually parenting his children he sent them home with you? As you said, his kids just lost their mother, yet he expects them to take on more responsibility than himself. I get that he's grieving, but the adult in the house has to pull themselves together and run the house and be the parent they signed up to be. That's their job. Also, you are still helping, just not in a way where your brother doesn't face consequences for his (in)actions.", "NTA. Your brother has obviously had a massive shock. You sound like an amazing sister helping him out.

Grief is always rough.\n\nThat said: You are not \"heartless\" for not doing all this stuff for him. If your family are so sure that someone needs to do this, then there's only one thing for it: They can sub in as housekeeper for a week on top of their other obligations. See how \\*they\\* feel about it. And then when they inevitably can't deal with it, ask them why they're being \"so heartless\".\n\nThe thing is, if it was a family perspective that he needs all the help: Why don't they offer to fill in on certain days, even? Sounds like they know exactly where you're coming from - they just want it to be you over any of them.", "You spent 14 months helping him learn the ropes. Everyone grieves differently, so knowing how the sudden loss impacted him is impossible, but he is a parent. Most parents realize they need to step up to help their children, but he did not do that.

We had several other gentler conversations, which I say in my post.", "So you think op didn't do more than their fair share of helping out?  They did way more than a lot of people would have, and op's brother needed the reality check.  He's allowed to grief, but he has kids to take care of, and he's not doing nearly enough himself to make sure his grief doesn't affect his kids.  Grief therapy would be good for sure, but it's not going to work if op's brother doesn't want to put the work in.\n\nHis wife died, that sucks hard, but what's important now is that the kids are in a safe environment, and op did more than enough to make that happen.\n\nNTA", "She did.

Is she supposed to raise his children in his home indefinitely?", "Yeah, they\u2019ve used the fact that I\u2019m single and childless that I have time to do it.

How much he has put on you OP is pathetic. I say this as someone well-acquainted with death. \n\nHe needs a grief counselor, and to come to terms with the fact that he was leeching off of his wife\u2019s labor. He doesn\u2019t pull his weight\u2014physically, emotionally, mentally. \n\nHe will mourn his deceased wife all his life, but he can no longer mourn his irresponsible lifestyle. He has to be a father now. Life is hard, but he is the adult here\u2014not his kids!\n\nI bet he will find a replacement wife as soon as possible, expecting her to do all the adult work again because of his ingrained misogyny.

My dad would not do a single task. I cooked, cleaned, did laundry, helped my siblings with school work, etc. I really lost out on my childhood becoming \"mom\" of the house because my dad was, to put it nicely, lazy. This has caused a strained relationship with my father and this was 20-ish years ago. You or the oldest daughter should not be in charge of the household. That is his job and his job alone.

Either way you are all these girls have got and you're doing the right thing holding onto them. NTA", "NTA You are 100% right he didn't just lose a wife, those girls lost their mother. Instead of stepping up and being a supportive dad to them, he made them support him. They deserve better. He can grieve and feel lost, but he can't make his daughters pay the price for it.  If he's still unable to do anything because of grief, he needs therapy. If he's just using it as an excuse, he needs a kick in the a$$ to get his act together. Either way, something needs to change.

Sorry for the terrible tragedy, no one deserves this. It is hard to judge a man who lost a wife and the mother of his kids, but it is really unfair for the girls, who lost their mom, to also lose their childhoods (arguably already somewhat gone) to do the chores your brother can\u2019t juggle with work. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, it sounds like he\u2019s in a pit of grief and doesn\u2019t have the autonomy to get back control of his life. Hopefully he can soon come to the realization and take on the parent role that the kids need. Sorry again for your loss and wishing you and your family the best.", "NTA. Is he in any type of grief counseling?", "NTA \nDeath is horrible, painful, and turns your life upside down. Nevertheless, life and the world around survivors marches on, and it is necessary to deal with it.

You can grieve adn still be responsible.", "Agree.   CPS is not the way to go.  You're right to take the girls to let him figure out how to take care of himself.  He's clearly parentifying the eldest and taking total advantage of you.  You've done your piece.  Tell family with the tudes to go clean up after him themselves.", "NTA. You laid it all out for him, and he made his choice. You're doing what's best for your nieces. They matter most.\n\nYour family's attitude about how you're treating him is a big indicator of why he is the way he is. No one seems to expect him to pull his weight, despite the burden he's placing on his daughters.", "You\u2019re an amazing aunt, OP. Those girls are lucky to have you. \n\nMy mom died when I was 13. It was traumatic. I had a dad who was a lot like your brother. I really needed support, but he couldn\u2019t get out of his own way. My aunts didn\u2019t think it was their place to interfere, so it just went downhill. I moved out at 17, struggled to make my own way and resented not only my father but also my aunts for not intervening. He was a mess. They had no excuse. \n\nOP, you are NTA. You are providing much needed stability to those girls. Please make sure you are taking care of yourself too. Taking guardianship of 3 kids is a lot. You will need some respite too. It concerns me that your family support system is scapegoating you. Do you have others who can help you out? Is your brother providing for the girls financially?", "Yeah my dad was the same way. From the ages of ten plus I would cook him every meal, gave him a list for grocery shopping, help my younger brothers do the schoolwork, and all the laundry and cleaning. It was a heavy load, and I feel like he stole my childhood from my by his own weaponized incompetence. The killer is, after I left for college, my younger brothers had to do the same thing. Now that I\u2019m 25 and we are all living on our own, my dad struggles to take care of himself in almost every way. He tries to get me to pity him, but it\u2019s not working.

It sounds like you helped him as much as you could, and are being very generous and loving to take in your nieces so that they get the care/structure they need. Your brother sounds like he needs some serious therapy. Maybe help him get set up with a therapist and make sure he goes to those appointments, but otherwise you've done more than enough. If I lost my spouse, the kids would be my top priority.

Then theyll get sent to you instead of a group home. \n\nAll that aside, no, NTA. At first i sided with him. Grief is hard and doesnt have a timeline... but this isnt grief. You can still do the minimum. But even more so when you said he can afford bith a nanny and a maid, he has no excuses.", "Wait wait wait. He had a choice between stepping up, hiring a nanny and a cleaner, keeping his family together. Or sending his kids off with you\u2026 And he chose option B.

How did the girls end up with you? Did your brother decide it was for the best?\n\nAlso, people saying let cps involved probably have absolutely no idea what cps does. The state will not take a kid from their biological parent unless they are basically in some sort of immediate danger (due to violence or drugs).

All I can say here is my own anecdote. I lost my partner in 2020 suddenly. It absolutely traumatized me. Then I lost my mom a few short months after. They were not covid losses either. Natural deaths. And I ended up with a massive load of grief. I absolutely shattered. But I still managed to get up to do what I needed to do. Some days that's all I did. And I did it on auto pilot at that. But damnit, I did it. Doing those things often became the only way I had to get outside of myself for a bit. Your brother needs to game face it up. Take care of basic needs.", "NTA. The children definitely need to be back with their father and he needs to step up.

Thank you for being there for those girls. If they are staying with you long term, you should try to get a letter from your brother giving you the right to get them medical treatment, etc. I have done letters like this for my kids when they traveled with their grandparents. Look up in loco parentis laws in your state. Make sure you have their health insurance cards, etc.\n\nIf I were you, and this continued long term without the father re-assuming responsibility, I would call the school district\u2019s social worker or school psychologist, particularly for the 12 year old. I would explain the situation and say that you are worried her education will suffer because she is being parentified, and that the young ones will suffer because they are being parented by a 12 year old. School social workers can help find grief counseling, family counseling, etc. Plus, they are a neutral 3rd party who can report to CPS if they feel there is actual neglect or abuse. It\u2019s possible that having to explain himself to someone who is not a family member will wake your brother up to reality.\n\nAnd bless that 12 year old. She would have been well within her rights not get the other two to school, and let the father field calls from school wondering why he didn\u2019t bring them in!", "So much NTA , OP! You did your best, but he has his head up his own a$$ he can\u2019t see passed his own needs and wants. Your family and he are A  Holes for putting you and your nieces in this situation. I\u2019d suggest getting a lawyer and apply/sue for custody and child support from him on the ground of him being a de@dbe@t father and child neglect. He hasn\u2019t been a parent to those poor girls at all. Your family is enabling his toxic behaviour and in the end is doing far more harm than good. Good on you for stepping up and supporting the girls! \n\nHonestly, if he was truly grieving, I highly doubt he\u2019d be going out with friends so much. \n\nSue for custody and child support, protect those girls like you have been doing. \n\nNTA NTA NTA!", "Make sure you get child support.", "NTA \n\nBut\u2026what\u2019s your plan for these poor kids?

If you keep them for a while, it might cause them more emotional trauma when you have to drop them back on his door step because you can\u2019t raise them full time. It\u2019s not fair, but speaking as one of them, some kids just have to deal with crap, self absorbed parents who don\u2019t know how to be parents.

In which case, power & strength to you for doing something so noble and selfless. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for you for being in such a crap situation.

If the kids were a bit older I would have said the better move would have been to let him abuse them a bit longer then call CPS so you have more legal standing to protect those kids. But 3 years is way too young to survive that kind of neglect for long.\n\nThough next time don't be coy about him being a horrific parent. Let him have it. Really grind into him what a horrific person he is. How distressed his dead wife is looking down on her children suffering. Be cruel, be vicious, protect those children at all costs.", "NTA. Just because you won\u2019t call cps doesn\u2019t mean a teacher won\u2019t if they realise the situation", "You're right - NTA.\n\nBut aside from trying to teach him to parent, which is failing obviously (and I am NOT blaming you for that! You have clearly gone above & beyond). \n\nIs he getting other support aside from you? Is he in Grief therapy? Has he joined any berived parents groups?\n\nMaybe a more compassionate approach here **is** to take the girls for an extended stay with you, and tell him he has 6 months to get his shit together. He can hang out with them a couple of times a week to maintain his relationship without pressure there, but his real focus should be him for a little while.\n\nLet us assume the best about him, he truly IS swamped in grief still and basic functioning is beyond him, even with the motivation of caring for his kids - let's assume it IS an impossibility for him.\n\nFine. That's the reality. In that case, what is to be done about it? No amount of cajoling, begging, threats etc. are going to fix his core problem - the overwhelming grief. It is not uncommon for the surviving parent to sink so deeply into their grief they fail miserably at every other area beyond just surviving. \n\nSo that is the priority for him to work on, and **WORK ON**, not take advantage of you taking the girls for a while to sit on his ass at home and stare sadly at walls. He starts doing weekly grief therapy, with a solo therapist and possibly a group if that works for him (group therapy isn't for everyone and that's fair). He makes progress on grief management for a short while (3 months is usually a good time to allow for settling into a groove with therapy and starting to make the baby steps of real progress), he then starts reclaiming his home - whether this looks like hiring a housekeeper or doing it himself doesn't matter, the important thing is reclamation happens and structure is restored. \n\nThen the kids, he starts spending MINDFUL parenting time with them, rebuilding those relationships and re-investing himself in them as little people he ACTIVELY LOVES and who are part of him, not just little people who are under his feet needing stuff at home he just wants to keep quiet.\n\nOnce those pieces come together, he picks up the parenting again, the kids start living with him again, and he parents them in a healthy and appropriate way. Because right now that is clearly impossible for him. \n\nAnd if he still cannot at that time, it's time to think of the long term solutions for the girls and let him do whatever. \n\nAnd if he asks you if you think he's a bad dad in future, the answer is \"Right now? You are being a bad parent. The kids lost their mother. You're not the only one who lost someone vital here. Your kids need you to step up and parent - that means providing them a clean, safe and loving home - and if you cannot do it physically and emotionally yourself because of your grief, that is actually OK! That's hard to do immediately. \n\nBut then you NEED to provide alternatives for them so they can keep being kids and heal from this loss too. Hire a nanny or housekeeper to make sure the home is safe and clean, and spend more time with them just loving them without the pressure of house upkeep. \n\nBut what you do NOT do is you do NOT get your 12 yr old to become replacement mommy. That is forcing her to take the role of a parent, it's actually got a name, it's called parentification and it is such a shitty thing to do a child it is literally classified as abuse. So if you do that, then my answer will become YES, you are a bad father. \n\nYour grief is understandable, being overwhelmed is understandable... but you have resources to provide better for your kids AND yourself. Do better for them AND for you or they will leave when they're 18 and never look back because right now you are abandoning them when they need your love and care the most.\"\n\nGood luck, and thank you for stepping in to love those kids when they need it most.

This left me with three kids to raise (who at the time were 16, 10, and 7) by myself. My parents are long gone, and her family couldn't do much because of the quarantines. I had to step up and make sure they were fed, clothed, doing well in remote school, had appropriate chores, help them find hobbies, teach them to ride bikes, and so on. All of this happened while I was working full time (computer geek with a WFH gig).\n\nTo this day, their mom's family are almost completely uninvolved with them. I totally get that they may not want to deal with me very much, but my kids see the lack of attention and passive-aggressive comments from them. They've almost completely written off their mom's family due to this.\n\nIn January 2022 and I met someone through online dating. Nearly eighteen months later and we're still crazy about each other. My kids like her, and her kids like me. With both of our work schedule, a day on the weekend is usually all she and I get, but we make the most of it. We even get our families (parents, kids, and dogs) together periodically because they all have fun.\n\nu/drowningunder, your brother needs to get his fucking head out of his ass and grow up. If this 50 year old solo dad can have kids who are happy and comfortable enough to talk with me about anything (their mom, periods, gender questions, how to cook mac and cheese, etc.), plus a relationship, plus friends, then he really has no excuse for his actions. He's milking the situation for all it's worth so he doesn't have to step up.\n\nI'm glad you were able to take in his kids, but that's not a healthy long-term solution for you or them. I'm not sure how you can get him to wake up, especially when the rest of the family seems to be enabling him, but it's got to happen. Soon enough, his kids will see what kind of father he is, and they'll resent him for it.", "NTA OP, but get child support for those kids, before he gets used to having the extra money and freedom to spend it.", "Nta.

They're quick to offer your help, but not their own. That goes to show that they know exactly what your brother is like, and that he will continue to do this as long as you let him.

Can the rest of the family step up for child care or for him?", "So like they said below....I would look into legal guardianship....even child support.", "And you know nothing about severe depression. O", "Ignore that ridiculous comment. There is no way you\u2019re the problem here. Your brother is a shit parent. End of story. He cannot use the grief excuse and then go out partying with his friends while leaving his kids alone at home. You seem fine with raising his kids, which sounds much better for them. If you don\u2019t want any money from him for doing this at least make him have college funds for each kid. NTA.", "They're probably worried they'll have to step in so attack OP", "Why would CPS be called if the children are living in a safe environment and being well cared for? If because OP is their aunt & not the biological parent shouldn't play into this unless their father decides to make an issue of it while sounds like he isn't beyond whining to family.", "I\u2019m not sending the girls back to be neglected. Period. If it\u2019s enabling him, fine. I will not let them get hurt or parentified to \u201cteach him a lesson\u201d. Because he won\u2019t give a shit. But they\u2019ll be traumatized.\n\nRespect this is non-negotiable.", "Exactly. It's not grief. It's just sparkling misogyny.", "After 14 months, that's not grieving.  That's wallowing in self pity.  He should either be stepping up immediately or in therapy for depression.\n\nNo, wait, I'm wrong.  He should be in therapy for depression immediately AND stepping up.  Leaving his eldest to run the household as he is is called \"parentification\", it is a form of child abuse, and it is _absolutely_ something the law can and should step in over.\n\nThe children are grieving too, but they don't get to give up on their responsibilities, or stop hanging out with people.  And they don't have the money to just hire a nanny, which he does.\n\nNTA, OP.  But everyone in your family is.\n\nThe next time family tell you you should be willing to help because you're family, say 'oh, thanks for volunteering to help because you're family; that makes my life and his much easier' and present them with a schedule for which days they're responsible for getting the children to school, which meals they're responsible for cooking, and when it's their turn to clean his house.\n\nHave no further contact with anyone who doesn't either do their share or immediately apologise.  In fact, have no further contact with anyone who doesn't do _both_.  You have bigger problems to worry about than your family's whiny, selfish hypocrisy.", "What? Seriously, you have to be the *least funny* troll ever. \n\nGrief looks different for everyone. It's deeply personal. And for most people, it requires support as well as appropriate distraction. The support of friends and loved ones is top of the list.", "Depression appears in many forms, so you can't really say that he isn't. He needs to get his shit together either way though.", "I would not even say OP is leveraging the kids, she\u2019s centering their well-being. And good for her; someone needs to!", "I\u2019m thinking OP realized this as well if not in the same terms.", "He won\u2019t. She\u2019s going to end up with those kids\u2026", "It's why one of my best friends called CPS on her own dad 2 years after her mom died, and lost her whole family as a result. And her foster home caused lasting trauma on top of the rest of her trauma and it's been 25 years since and she's only now getting to deal with *any* of it.", "This must be the first time in months I've seen parentification legitimately used correctly on this sub!", "People like that won't learn. They just plop the responsibilities onto the oldest. OP is doing what is best for the children.", "There isn\u2019t any good reason to involve the \u201cauthorities\u201d at this point. All that will do is bring the system into the situation, and cause even more stress, anger, and confusion.", "If getting his kids back isn't enough to make him step up, nothing will and the kids are better off without him at that point.", "He can go get the kids whenever he wants. He\u2019s their legal guardian. He\u2019s choosing not to. \n\nMeanwhile, OP is making sure those kids don\u2019t suffer further neglect/abuse from their father and have their needs met.", "If having his kids taken away because he can\u2019t/won\u2019t take care of it won\u2019t get him to learn, nothing will.", "Well, it's not uncommon for a 12yo to babysit small children. But babysitters should be doing it by choice and should be paid.", "Assuming he is grieving, if he\u2019s in such a state that he\u2019s incapable of caring for his children after 14 months, he needs therapy. He probably needs therapy regardless to get his head out of his ass.", "She isn\u2019t interested in escalating the situation to involve the courts and court orders. She wants her nieces taken care of and her brother to shape  up. It\u2019s weird so many of you are so gung-ho about involving CPS an and the courts. \n\nA regular nightmare.", "The hell? She just doesn\u2019t want to involve CPS or have the girls be taken into a strangers home when she happily is willing to have them in her home and support them with her own funds. How the hell is that her unwilling to accept reality? Because she\u2019d rather just give the girls the childhood they deserve rather than fight the dad for child support that he probably will fight against paying, or rather she ship them off into the states custody?", "They think I should stop by daily and do the work of the mother, while he just shows up when he feels. They say that\u2019s healthiest for the kids.", "Severe depression is not a valid excuse to neglect 3 daughters who lost their mom and now have their dad being actively unhelpful.", "Please describe what would be a better approach, that's different that what OP has already been doing for the last 14 months.", ">No one said anything about forcing him to get therapy\n\nCommentor:\n\n>Sounds like brother and the kids need grief therapy to work through their emotions.", "OP has taken literally every approach besides calling CPS on this neglectful and abusive asshole cause she doesn\u2019t want her nieces to end up in stage care. OP has does EVERYTHING for 14 months to support her brother and try to help her brother get better and take care of his kids and he refuses to do that. He couldn\u2019t even be a big enough man to take his own kids to school or watch them and made his 12 year old miss a school dance to hang out with friends. \n\nThis man does not need grief therapy because he\u2019s WAYYYY PASSED grief therapy. He didn\u2019t do shit before the wife died and he isn\u2019t doing shit now so what makes you think he\u2019ll get any better and start raising his own damn children? I\u2019ll answer that for you NEVER because he didn\u2019t do shit for the 12 years he had a wife and now he doesn\u2019t have a wife and expects his sister to be the role of mom and wife.", "Everyone jumps to \"call CPS\" but OP obviously loves her nieces, how could she put them through that?\n\nNTA, I hope he gets some help for his grief and is able to parent his children, but they are very lucky to have someone looking out for their best interests.", "I admire that you\u2019re willing to take them on so completely. That\u2019s really going above and beyond. NTA- your brother should have been doing his share all along, and as long as it\u2019s feasible I think you keeping the girls is for the best.\n\nJust look out for when he inevitably starts dating to find the replacement wife/mother so he doesn\u2019t have to do anything. And lock down the legal guardianship", "The girls are lucky to have you, otherwise this is exactly what would have happened to them. I can't believe your family though. If they are so keen on helping him, they can take turns. If you found the time to do all this they'll manage a few hours here and there. I'm not even talking about a mile in your boots, just five friggin' steps.", "Then maybe you should seek temporary custody of the children until he gets counseling?  I honestly don't know what to recommend, but I agree with you 100% that the children shouldn't be allowed to be neglected just to avoid \"enabling\" his behavior.", "What\u2019s your end goal here? How long does your brother have to get it together before you return his children? If that never happens, are you keeping them forever? You\u2019d have a case for him signing over physical custody to you with him paying child support if CPS is involved. As it stands, you have no legal right to make medical decisions or otherwise, like taking them to therapy. You may see this as protecting them but you\u2019re also traumatizing them by removing them from their home and their parent.", "[removed]", "Yeah but that doesn't give him a free pass to completely abandon all responsibilities and make his 12 year old daughter do all the chores. He needs to come to realize he us now the only parent aka both the mother and father and needs to get his shit together and/or someone to help. As op said sure he lost his wife but his kids lost their mother and need a parent to help them adjust and greive now.", "I know you chose to misinterpret this comment in bad faith, though I don\u2019t know exactly why. \n\nClearly this person is saying if you are able to plan and go out with friends while depriving your daughter of being a kid to do your job for you then you are capable of just taking care of your kids. Without putting it all on your deceased wife.\n\nBut we both know you understood that.", "\u201cAppropriate distraction\u201d isn\u2019t letting your sister and kids do your job so you can go out with friends.  His grief is not more important than his responsibility to his family.", "I don't know all the ways people show grief, but a good way to show you are an AH is to make your 12 year old miss a dance and stay home to parent when the actual parent goes out drinking.", "If he is well enough to go out with friends, he\u2019s well enough to take care of his kids.", "I'm not saying he's definitively not depressed. But if he can push through that hypothetical depression to maintain a job and hang out with his friends, then he can certainly push through it to properly care for his children.", "He did zero housework, childcare, etc. when his wife was still alive. She did everything despite her also having a full time job. So personally I don't think depression is the reason for why he acts like he does. He just doesn't want to do \"woman's work\" either because he thinks he is too \"manly\" or something for it or he is just too lazy or a combination of both.", "Wow! It isn\u2019t right of him to do this to those girls and it isn\u2019t right for them to think this is \u201cnormal.\u201d No matter what you are doing the right thing by thinking about those girls\u2019 needs first. He is just thinking of himself. Even if they go back and he treats them just the same, they will know by your actions that this is wrong.", "That\u2019s definitely NOT healthiest for the kids!", "The family is out of their cotton-pickin minds!  This is not your job!", "Yeah, fuck that.", "So I'm reading all the comments and I'm gonna break it down.\n\n1st choice- get some kind of guardianship over those kids and raise them.\n\n2nd choice- keep doing what you are doing.\n\n3rd choice- cps to hopefully scare the shit outta him(I know you said you don't wanna do this, but dude these are your options).\n\nYOU can't force him to take care of his kids and your family obviously doesn't give a fck. You either do it yourself, or someone of authority is gonna have to get his ass into shape.\n\nEdit to say can anyone else think of another solution?", "There is a huge difference between saying \u201csounds like they need\u201d and \u201cforcing\u201d. Learn to read.", "You can usually assign short-term guardianship without CPS or a court order. If the father consents to OP acting as guardian, a signed and notarized agreement will usually work for situations 6 months or less. If the father is still not willing to be a parent, family courts can help with a longer term guardianship.\n\nIt sounds like the kids' safety is not at risk, so CPS is not the best way to handle this.", "Unless you absolutely must, I wouldn\u2019t get \u201cthe system\u201d involved. Very rarely does CPS, the courts, our police make anything better.", "If having his girls stay with his aunt didn't convince to make one meal or clean up after himself them nothing will. \n\nI'm just worried he'll find some naive 20-yo to be interim mom/domestic labor instead.", "I absolutely did not say or suggest that.", "I never said that. You're making a lot of assumptions.", "Again, huge assumptions. \n\nI NEVER said that was okay. It's DEEPLY wrong. \n\nI took issue with the suggestion that 'true grief' is exclusive from spending time with friends.", "That's a bullshit false equivalency. People need support while grieving. \n\nAnd since apparently no one pays attention: I INCLUDE THE KIDS IN THIS. THEY ABSOLUTELY NEED AND DESERVE SUPPORT.\n \nThe appropriate response would be therapy for him AND the kids, AND him continuing to engage with his natural supports **WHILE APPROPRIATELY SUPPORTING HIS KIDS.**", "I would say him being depressed or not is a moot point. He is lucky he has a sister who was able to step in and help, but many people do not. This normally means even despite dealing with grief, they have to step up and prioritize their children.", "If she can get child support from him, she can use that to hire help for herself. Cleaners, etc.\n\nHe is not going to fix himself. He has refused to. I suspect the only way through to him is via the friends he goes out with instead of being a dad. I can't imagine they're going to help, but perhaps he hides the truth from them.\n\nHe is absolutely toxic. Enabled by his family who failed to raise him to be a man. \n\nBut why should OP sacrifice her life for him? What about her future? She deserves one.", "She doesn\u2019t need to involve the courts or CPS, she can continue doing what she is doing, and with thr help of the girls and the family, the father will start stepping up.\n\nThere isn\u2019t any good reason to put the kids through social workers, court dates, and the kind of real animosity and hatred that stems from involving the authorities.", "Maybe, just maybe, the perpetually lazy father is using his grief to continue to push off his responsibility onto his sister and daughter because he doesn't feel like paying for help?\n\nIt's saying something that his concern of about being called a bad dad just meant he...changed absolutely nothing about what he was/still is doing.", "Yeah but\u2026 he chose to do only one of those things you suggest - going out. \nSure we grieve differently, but he needs to step up as a father or admit he is a shit one currently.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get the benefit of \u201ceveryone griefs differently\u201d anymore", "Option 2", "I said what I said and I explained pretty thoroughly.", "Sure, and many of us probably disagree.", "You disagree that his kids should be priority and he also has needs? Okay. Go off I guess."]}
