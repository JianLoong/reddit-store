It's a huge room with private bath, private balcony, *two* sliding door closets, and an additional walk-in storage closet in the hallway. There is central air and heat, the fastest internet my address can get, and two outdoor spaces. There is a laundry room. The hardwood flooring is brand new. We agreed the rent would start after he got his new job. He told me repeatedly, \"Once I get this job, I can pay rent like a normal tenant no problem.\"\n\nHe got the offer over a week ago for the new job. I told him this week the lease would start on March 15 and rent would be $1,350 with internet and all utilities included, and he balked at that price. I told him fine, that we could do 3 months at $1,000 and then 9 months at $1,350 with all utilities included. Nope, he's still balking at that price. His reasoning is because he HAS to buy a $15,000 car and it HAS to be a used Prius. I encouraged him to buy a cheaper car and widen the brands and models he's considering, but he refuses because a Prius with specific options is his \"perfect car.\" I have never spent that much on a car. He acts like because I own a home I must be rich.\n\nI am 1 mile West of SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. My tenants in 2012 paid $1,250/month, so I have only increased the rent by $100 in 11 years and he's complaining. I worked hard to buy this house (80-100+ hrs a week for all of my 20s) and work hard now to maintain it. You cannot find a private room with private bath anywhere near me for the price I am offering him. The only cheaper place near me is a dormitory-style house where 4 adults share 1 bedroom (2 bunk beds) for $750. I do think that's outrageous and believe what I'm offering is more than fair. I feel like telling him, if you think you can find a better deal then do it.\n\nHe's acting like I'm an asshole for not lowering the rent. Am I the asshole for taking this position?
