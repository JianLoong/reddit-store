It's a huge room with private bath, private balcony, *two* sliding door closets, and an additional walk-in storage closet in the hallway. There is central air and heat, the fastest internet my address can get, and two outdoor spaces. There is a laundry room. The hardwood flooring is brand new. We agreed the rent would start after he got his new job. He told me repeatedly, \"Once I get this job, I can pay rent like a normal tenant no problem.\"\n\nHe got the offer over a week ago for the new job. I told him this week the lease would start on March 15 and rent would be $1,350 with internet and all utilities included, and he balked at that price. I told him fine, that we could do 3 months at $1,000 and then 9 months at $1,350 with all utilities included. Nope, he's still balking at that price. His reasoning is because he HAS to buy a $15,000 car and it HAS to be a used Prius. I encouraged him to buy a cheaper car and widen the brands and models he's considering, but he refuses because a Prius with specific options is his \"perfect car.\" I have never spent that much on a car. He acts like because I own a home I must be rich.\n\nI am 1 mile West of SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. My tenants in 2012 paid $1,250/month, so I have only increased the rent by $100 in 11 years and he's complaining. I worked hard to buy this house (80-100+ hrs a week for all of my 20s) and work hard now to maintain it. You cannot find a private room with private bath anywhere near me for the price I am offering him. The only cheaper place near me is a dormitory-style house where 4 adults share 1 bedroom (2 bunk beds) for $750. I do think that's outrageous and believe what I'm offering is more than fair. I feel like telling him, if you think you can find a better deal then do it.\n\nHe's acting like I'm an asshole for not lowering the rent. Am I the asshole for taking this position?

And you had been letting him. Don\u2019t be a dunce. NTA.", "NTA, either he pays it or he goes and you find a different tenant.", "NTA why are you even negotiating with this person?? You own this home and you decide what the rent is. He is an AH for thinking HE determines the price here.", "NTA- kick this mooch to the curb. SEE YA!!", "NTA: Your place sounds absolutely incredible, I'm renting an old place with outdated everything for $950.. He's gotten too used to your graciousness over the last few months. What your asking for is not too much at all for what you've described, especially with utilities.  He needs to lower his expectations on the things he WANTS in life , having the exact dream car you would like is rare, and is not a need...", "NTA. He is using you, and you need to evict him.", "NTA If this guy doesn't like the rent give him a move out date. It's your house not a charity.", "You DID lower the rent though, and he still refused to pay. NTA", "INFO what is your relationship to this person?", "Do you have a written contract? If not YTA if you do then NTA", "Time to tell him to start his search for his own place. NTA", "NTA. Then tell him to move out.", "NTA\n\nHis \"dream stuff\" is not worth more than you financial future. He can figure out what he can afford somewhere else.", "Stop negotiating with him. Put the lease n front of him, require a 1 month deposit, put a late fee penalty clause and tell him he signs or he has 30 days notice to leave. Frankly I wouldn\u2019t want him there as he will continue to find other reasons to not pay. What happened if he doesn\u2019t like his job ? Then you\u2019re stuck with him staying for free again. Quit sacrificing your financial position by coddling this freeloader. Sorry to be blunt. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019d get your shit together or he is going to squat and you\u2019ll never get him out. That price is a steal and he\u2019s gaslighting you.", "NTA. I would suggest finding the legal way to kick him out, because even if he pays the rent you're asking, he'll do it begrudgingly and be terrible to live with.", "NTA. Tell him the rent is $1350/mo, and if he doesn\u2019t like it, he can find his price range elsewhere starting April 1. Quit supporting this boy.", "NTA.  I assume the Prius will have heat/AC but I think they have a known defect in providing running water.", "NTA- be careful with how you approach this situation, in many states squatters rights make it so that someone cannot be removed from a property, if not on the lease, as soon as mail has been sent to that address. I would definitely do research on it so that he can't sue you for the money for his new car!", "Right?! I feel like we're missing some pretty important information here. OP, why did you agree to \"help\" this person out in the first place? What is his relationship to you?", "Well...thanks for the laugh!", "I\u00b4m not american i am just some guy who reads the dumb stories at /legaladvice from time to time.\n\nBut isn\u00b4t ther this thing calle tenant rights after someone lives somewhere for a long enough time. Even without paying. \n\nDepending on the legal situation the poster above may have made the most important answer to the OP in this thread.\n\nObviously i am just some idiot on the internet but if i where in this situation i would very much like to actually now the facts about this.", "Soft NTA. It sounds like the conversation was vague and that no specific amount was decided on in advance, though you did give a ballpark. I think it would have benefitted both of you if you'd decided a specific amount before move-in, because the vagueness left room for misinterpretation on his part. With that said, I think you're well within your rights to set the rent at whatever amount you want to set, and that it would be ok to tell him to go find a better deal (assuming you follow whatever notice you need to give).", "That is why I say to start the process immediately - depending on how litigious the 'squatter' is, it could take more than a year to get them out."]}
