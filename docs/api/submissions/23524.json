He curses at and calls our mom Diana (her first name.) I think a big reason for this is because Troy\u2019s dad isn\u2019t in his life and my mom really hasn\u2019t handled it in the best way. \r  \n\r  \nMom makes excuses for Troy like \u201che hasn\u2019t been the same since his father left\u201d but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s tried therapy and she\u2019s basically given up and decided that Troy is just going to be this way and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do about it.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom tells lies to hide how bad things actually are with Troy. I think she\u2019s in denial herself and it\u2019s her coping mechanism to avoid being too overwhelmed with the situation. Because it\u2019s not as if Troy acts any better in front of people outside the family.\r  \n\r  \nTroy was kicked out of his public school after an extremely cruel \u201cprank.\u201d But she\u2019s told people that she started homeschooling Troy because she \u201crealized that gifted kids need to lead their own education.\u201d He\u2019s in a homeschool co-op right now but is on thin ice because of how he acts.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ve had to help with Troy and have ended up doing a lot more parenting than a sister should have to. Oftentimes our mom couldn\u2019t get off work and I would end up having to take home Troy or talk to his teachers because he got in trouble. \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s a strain because Troy really doesn\u2019t respect me much more than he does our mom. He flips me off and calls me names and yells over stupid things. Troy doesn\u2019t show any real respect or appreciation even when I\u2019m trying to do something nice for him.\r  \n\r  \nMy friend Hayley\u2019s sister just got married and moved in with her now husband. Meaning there\u2019s an empty room at Hayley\u2019s house. Hayley and her parents said that as long as I pull my weight with chores and stay out of trouble, I can live with them and pay basically nothing in rent.\r  \n\r  \nI took Hayley\u2019s offer and have been living with her for about four months. Unfortunately, things are not going well with Troy and our mom. She told me that she can\u2019t handle Troy on her own and begged me to come back home because she needs help with him.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom offered to buy me a car and pay for all its insurance and gas if I came back, I know this is not an easy thing for her and it means she is desperate. I told my mom that I was sorry but I like my current living situation and don\u2019t want to go back to Troy\u2019s chaos and disrespect.\r  \n\r  \nI told my mom that I loved her but she said I was breaking her heart and she accused me of not even caring. I feel awful because I know my mom is desperate and she can\u2019t handle Troy. But he doesn\u2019t respect me and I can\u2019t deal with him either.

You absolutely do not owe it to her to be Troy's second parent. \n\nYour mom needs to look into tough love, parenting classes, or just effective parenting. There are literally a million free parenting resources she could have taken advantage of, instead she used you.\n\nHayley's parents are being quite generous and I'm so glad for you. Enjoy your time there. Do more than they ask of you. If you work be sure to buy something small but noticable to chip in (a small grocery run, pizza, etc). If you don't work, maybe volunteer to cook or bake here and there, or whatever would make the parents' lives easier. And really, enjoy the time!", "NTA\n\nYour mother is not doing anything about your brother's behavior, so why should you have to put up with him?\n\nYour brother needs a psychiatric evaluation, a treatment plan and therapy.  If your mother refuses to do this, she deserves to live with the consequences.", "NTA.  Your mom is overwhelmed and not making good choices -- but emotionally manipulating her child to take care of her younger child is not a good look on anyone.  The offer of the car is tempting, but it sounds like you already realize it's not worth it.  What your mom needs to do is figure out how to parent her son.  You should stay where you are for as long as you can, not only for yourself, but so she's motivated to do what she needs to do.  Good luck.", "NTA and your mother probably has no intention of honoring her promise regarding the car.  Once you are back and she has her claws in you again, why would she?", "NTA. Stay gone. This child is not your problem nor your responsibility. Your mother is trying to buy YOU, with a car. Are you for sale? I hope not. Stay gone, please, for your own sake.", "NTA.  You are 19 - you don't need to live at home.  He is not your child, so you are not obliged to take care of him.  I know that sounds awful, but he is out of control, and you don't have to deal with that.  It is totally OK if you want to have a peaceful life without his chaos, as you put it.", "NTA you need to put your self before your brother.\n\nYour mom created this monster. If she doesn\u2019t do something soon(it may be too late) your brother will end up in a juvenile detention center over his behavior. This is her problem. She needs to fix it.\n\nYou are not a parent this is not your responsibility to fix. Your mom needs to get him help and stop making excuses.", "NTA. Your brother is her responsibility.

Stay gone. Mom created a problem, let you handle it while she denied it, and now is having to face the reality of what she did. This is not your problem to deal with. This is hers.\n\nIt's hard she's in this situation, but her choices led her up to this.\n\nBottom line, you deserve a life. She doesn't get to ruin your life.", "NTA. It doesn't seem like moving back in would actually solve anything. You could make it conditional on him attending therapy or some other possible means of improving his behavior, but I kinda doubt that would work either. I hope things get better.", "NTA - You've repeatedly said that Troy needs a therapist. You are not a therapist. Your going back, with the explicit goal of helping with Troy, will fail and will drag you down as well. Troy needs more help, of a different kind, than you can provide.", "NTA. She's the parent, not you. She's the one who let Troy get that way.

Mom has badly needed a wake up call for a long time.", "NTA you should prioritize your well being first because your mother is too overwhelmed to care about it. Both your mom and Troy needs to be in therapy. Maybe suggest her to use the money she would spend on a car on her and her son mental wellness. She keeps enabling his behaviour by letting go and excusing him. You being there won\u2019t solve the root cause of the issue and risk putting your well being at risk as well. If your mom is really desperate she should starts at looking for long-term solutions.", "NTA. Your mother already gave your brother an extraordinary bad start in life with her parenting decisions, don't let her mess up your life too.\n\nShe can use the money she offered to bribe you with to pay for therapists, tutors, or nannies.

Troy is not your responsibility.  Your mother should not be sacrificing your mental health to him.   She needs to get him some mental health evaluations and intensive therapies--nothing you describe is normal 'gifted child' behavior, nor is it normal 'daddy issues' behavior.

Do not fall for your Mom guilt tripping you.   You going back won't help the situation.", "NTA. Your mom needs to pull her head out of the sand. All too often, the verbal abuse turns physical. Do not, under any circumstances, go back there.\n\nA friend's son was like this. He threatened to kill his siblings & parents, then used a large knife to try to get into their locked bedroom one night. They ended up having to \"abandon\" him to the state to get him out of the house and into treatment. He wasn't much older than your brother at the time. I saw the door before they replaced it. It looked disturbingly like the door in *The Shining*. \n\nIt took awhile to get a diagnosis (very difficult with teens) and find a combination of medications that got him stable & more or less back to the lovable loving person he was before he hit puberty. But he made it through. He still has to be in a group home and monitored, but he is able to spend time with his family regularly.\n\nYour brother needs help. I hope it doesn't take something even worse than a couple dozen knife strikes to a flimsy interior door for him to get it.", " NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
