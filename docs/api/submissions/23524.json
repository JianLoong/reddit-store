He curses at and calls our mom Diana (her first name.)

I think she\u2019s in denial herself and it\u2019s her coping mechanism to avoid being too overwhelmed with the situation. Because it\u2019s not as if Troy acts any better in front of people outside the family.\r  \n\r  \nTroy was kicked out of his public school after an extremely cruel \u201cprank.\u201d But she\u2019s told people that she started homeschooling Troy because she \u201crealized that gifted kids need to lead their own education.\u201d He\u2019s in a homeschool co-op right now but is on thin ice because of how he acts.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ve had to help with Troy and have ended up doing a lot more parenting than a sister should have to. Oftentimes our mom couldn\u2019t get off work and I would end up having to take home Troy or talk to his teachers because he got in trouble. \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s a strain because Troy really doesn\u2019t respect me much more than he does our mom.

Unfortunately, things are not going well with Troy and our mom. She told me that she can\u2019t handle Troy on her own and begged me to come back home because she needs help with him.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom offered to buy me a car and pay for all its insurance and gas if I came back, I know this is not an easy thing for her and it means she is desperate. I told my mom that I was sorry but I like my current living situation and don\u2019t want to go back to Troy\u2019s chaos and disrespect.\r  \n\r  \nI told my mom that I loved her but she said I was breaking her heart and she accused me of not even caring.

She definitely deserves some of the blame for how the situation turned out, but I don\u2019t think it makes her an AH simply for her shortcomings as a parent, nor for trying to ask for help in an area where she\u2019s clearly having trouble.
