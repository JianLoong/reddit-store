I think she\u2019s in denial herself and it\u2019s her coping mechanism to avoid being too overwhelmed with the situation. Because it\u2019s not as if Troy acts any better in front of people outside the family.\r  \n\r  \nTroy was kicked out of his public school after an extremely cruel \u201cprank.\u201d But she\u2019s told people that she started homeschooling Troy because she \u201crealized that gifted kids need to lead their own education.\u201d He\u2019s in a homeschool co-op right now but is on thin ice because of how he acts.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ve had to help with Troy and have ended up doing a lot more parenting than a sister should have to. Oftentimes our mom couldn\u2019t get off work and I would end up having to take home Troy or talk to his teachers because he got in trouble. \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s a strain because Troy really doesn\u2019t respect me much more than he does our mom.

Unfortunately, things are not going well with Troy and our mom.

She definitely deserves some of the blame for how the situation turned out, but I don\u2019t think it makes her an AH simply for her shortcomings as a parent, nor for trying to ask for help in an area where she\u2019s clearly having trouble.

If you feel guilty and want to help but not get sucked back in (please don't drown to save a drowning person) you could offer to help her get Troy into a therapeutic school.  This would be six years of therapy for free as the district has to pay for it.  You should not live in that environment but if you want to help, help her and Troy get actual, real help.

You did not have a child, you are barely an adult now- the weight of your home life has been severely hurting you in ways you probably haven't even processed yet. I am so proud of you for leaving so early and getting out of there. I am so proud of you for putting down boundaries and taking care of yourself first. It is the hardest thing to do, and you probably feel so much responsibility, and guilt, and shame that isn't yours to bare. Please look into therapy, at least to get you through this transition period so you don't go back there out of a feeling of obligation. \n\n---- unsolicited advice:\n\nYour mother may need to take your brother to a psychologist. My brother was similar in behavior and not able to stay in a school or eventually take care of himself because of uncontrolled behavior. I also have a close friend with a special needs child who displays a lot of uncontrolled rage and unruly behavior.\n\nThis is not me trying to diagnose your brother over the internet! It's just that my brother didn't start getting diagnosed until he became an adult, we had no tools to know how to raise him. Unfortunately, my brother died as an adult largely due to the isolation and lack of ability to maintain his emotions in a work enviorment due to these behaviors that grew so out of control as a teenager. So I may be projecting but if your brothers behavior seems unusually and consistently and shockingly uncontrollable, unpredictable, and unmanagable, I wouldn't be surprised if one of these (or all) is a potential factor:\n\nOppositional defiant disorder, \nAdhd, \nBipolar\n\nIf it is something like this- there are all kinds of resources your mother can tap into. Support groups, counseling, medication, and the education system would have to put an IEP in place which could get him back in school with the appropriate support in place (they would not be able to expel him due to behaviors related to official diagnosis).\n\nAgain, whether or not this is the case- you can't bare the responsibility of your mother or your brother. You need to fully form as a person yourself and cannot do that in the enviorment you were raised. They will not let you. You made the right choice to leave.", "NTA.

If you want to help, see which institutions can help your mother and help in initiating contact (a psychiatrist maybe, social workers etc.). This will never get better if the whole cycle of enabling your brother isnt broken. So far, what your mum and you did did not work. So cintinuing the old Pattern is a no go imo. \n\nAlso, you are not your brother's parent, and you shouldnt be. The money your mum wants to spent for the car - better to spent it on a social worker or a psychiatrist or stgh.
