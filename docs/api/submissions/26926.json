She have to buy a new one.\n\nNow for the problem i work in a very great MNC IT company which gives me electronics allowance (certain ammount) 2 times a year. 1st allowance is already used and now with 2nd allowance I was gonna buy myself a nice expensive gaming keyboard+mouse combo. Now my gf is asking me to buy a her a watch with my 2nd allowance and she will buy me a less expensive keyboard+mouse which is less than watche's price. I told her if she is willing to buy me the same one that I choose I'll buy her watch through my company but otherwise I'll get that keyboard+mouse combo that I want because I was waiting for almost 5 months for it. She tried to bargain me a alot because she was so used to that watch and all. But I told her I can't compromise on that keyboard+ mouse, it's important for gaming/coding. Now she calling me ass for using my better financial position on her which I am not.

Smh...", "NTA - i dont think its unreasonable for her to inquire but she shouldnt expect you to use it. If you had already planned on using it for something you shouldnt feel bad", "NTA her fault she can replace it herself.", "NTA. You already bought her gift and I understand it was an accident but she was careless and broke it. If you had dropped her watch I would understand her insisting you give up the keyboard/mouse to pay for it. It\u2019s your job\u2019s perk you are entitled to the perk. Buy the keyboard/mouse", "NTA.

She dropped it so 100% on her to replace.. but logically speaking it makes sense to use the tech allowance on the most expensive product. It depends on if you choose to get the watch or expensive keyboard set up.
