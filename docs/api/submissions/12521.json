The logic makes them freaking morons.", "That was my first thought!\n\n\"How am I supposed to eat my pizza without my drink?!\" \n\nLOL", "They should\u2019ve seen the drink in the cart, they could\u2019ve just asked.\n\n\u201cHey is it ok if we get drinks with our meal?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks\u201d", "They may not have looked at his order. I\u2019d have just picked my food and hit add to cart, I wouldn\u2019t have necessarily reviewed the cart to see what everyone else was getting", "Presumably there's a tap in the house", "This is a bit much. There's no reason a live-in partner shouldn't feel comfortable enough to open their mouth and ask if they aren't sure.", "I guess that kinda makes sense, whenever I order something online I always check the cart because I\u2019m afraid my items will fly away.", "NTA - grown ups know if they want a drink. You are not their caretaker.", "NTA you handed them the phone to order what they wanted. If they wanted a drink they should have added a drink", "You passed your phone around, NTA. They could have asked 'are we doing drinks' if they wanted, or hell, they could have looked at what you ordered.", "NTA\nThey wanted a drink? Should have ordered a drink.  That's how ordering food works", "Who gives af?", "Do you have access to water in your home? NTA.", "If you were holding the phone and reading the menu out to them and doing all the ordering yourself and only added a drink for yourself that would be rude BUT they had the same opportunity as you to add a drink. \nNTA", "NTA\n\nThere's no social norm that says you can't add a drink to an uber eats order as the phone is passed around. I have literally never heard of this.", "A. Are you paying for the whole meal or is everyone venmoing you after? So it doesn't matter WHAT they buy, they're paying for it. They can buy lobster and a bottle of wine for all it matters. \n\nB. It's between $1.50 and $3.00 to order a soda or something with your food. That super doesn't matter. Are you getting a $8 Boba drink? You CAN do that too, if your the one paying for it. Are you spending like $10 to add a beer? Cause that's just silly. You CAN, but it's silly.\n\nIt breaks no social norms to add a can of coke to your order. Drinks are PART of the meal. It doesn't break a social norm. You don't have to be stuck with water.", "NTA. \nI\u2019ve never heard that social norm before and it\u2019s probably because it doesn\u2019t exist. I can\u2019t stand people who act polite then get angry when you don\u2019t accomodate for their \u201csacrifice\u201d.", "NTA - follow the social norm of getting the food and drink you want.  Don't rely on others or follow made up rules.  If they're mad, it's at themselves.  It wouldn't even cross my mind to ask.", "No one likes to take responsibility for themselves anymore.  Always, if you can, blame someone else.  \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I don\u2019t understand this, if you\u2019re paying for your own food then who cares how much anyone orders?", "It\u2019s funny considering the more common use of that phrase too.", "But with no soda on the side\u2026", "They did away with the free awards :(", "I didn't realize my account on my phone wasn't the same as my desktop's. For now on I'll do a courtesy check for drinks but it didn't feel right to be berated about it when it happened", "Which apps?", "NTA.\n\nSomething is wrong with your partner and her friend if they have overanalyzed ordering drinks into \"social barriers\" and \"breaking the seal\" to order a drink. Its simple, if they want a drink, they should order one, no one needs to have their hand held through that.", "Not an asshole. \n\nYou are not waiting tables or hosting a dinner event.\n\nIf they wanted a drink, they could have ordered one. They possibly saw your order as well (since you passed your phone)\n\nThe thing is that they completely forgot about ordering drinks and when they saw that you are having one, they are feeling slightly jealous at the moment.", "NTA. That's not a social norm. They are just making that up to avoid admitting they made a mistake.", "NTA. Unless your partner and friend are little children that need you to cut their food for them too, they can make grown up decisions like whether or not they want a drink with their order.", "NTA wtf? You said \u201cget anything you want\u201d???? What part of that doesn\u2019t include drinks? What part of that doesn\u2019t include this ridiculous ass backwards social norm logic already? You shouldn\u2019t have to define what get anything you want means.", "NTA if they wanted a drink they should have ordered one or asked for one. Believe me if I was ordering a meal, I would certainly ask for a drink with it", "NTA - You ordered first. Honestly, I have been in the same position as the friend and what did I do? Look at what my friend had already added to the order and based what I wanted off of that. all the resources were in their hands, they just didn't use them.", "NTA closed mouth don't get fed", "Not to mention - they had the phone. They could SEE what he had ordered. They could see it included a drink.", "They did away with the free awards a while ago.", "NTA \u201cbreaks the seal for others to add a drink.\u201d What seal? This is the dumbest think ever. Get yourselves a glass of water and thank the person who kindly bought you dinner so you could have more time together.", "Wait, doesn\u2019t OP\u2019s GF live there?  If so, why is he the bad host?  Let them drink water. NTA.", "Nta...But it is an unspoken rule as well though....my sis and I do it...or when friends order we do this as well. Depends on who's paying and their budget but if everyone decides to order from one app we just cashapp the person our portion of the meal and pay for our own meal and drinks like that.", "NTA\n\nThey could've said \"I'll ha e the dim sims and get me a coke too\"", "Social norms? WTF? \ud83e\udd23"]}
