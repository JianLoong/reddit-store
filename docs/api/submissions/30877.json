I agree with this. I'm the same with my FIL who eats with his mouth wide open, talks with food in his mouth, and constantly shovels food into it. It's disgusting and ruins my appetite. You have three options:\n\n1) moan back to make it awkward and demonstrate why you feel uncomfortable\n2) ask politely to eat somewhere else because the moaning makes you uncomfortable \n3) deal with it, it's just your future MIL. You'll hate her for other reasons anyway (trust me) \n\nI'd choose (1) because chaos is good\n\nIf your partner defends his mother, just remember he's probably Freud's plaything and has mummy issues. His mother is just another person and is capable of being annoying", "NTA.\n\nYou might get up from the table again and when she complains, just say \"From all that moaning, it sounds like you might want to be alone with your food\" and then wink and keep going.", "NTA\n\nThat's awkward af. No way in hell I'd be sitting there listening to that for more than 10 seconds... The fact that she told you leaving the table is rude made me laugh. I would have told her it's also rude to make sounds like you're having sex at the dinner table.", "just start moaning with her. everytime she does it, do it louder.", "NTA. It may be rude to get up from the table, but it is doubly rude to make sex noises to your food. It could very easily make other people loose their appetite.", "This is hilarious ngl. \n\nI'd say \"the sex noises you make when you eat make me really uncomfortable and I lose my appetite and can't eat. Do you think you could please try to tone them down in front of me?\"\n\nNTA if you say something.", "My husband does something similar under his breath. Ive mentioned it to him before bc it is annoying. Seriously those sounds are for the bedroom dude\u2026not dinner. I was told I was rude (I was polite in how I phrased it.). If she feels you are rude for leaving the table maybe suggest she is rude for making bedroom sounds at the dinner table and it causes you to lose your appetite. Would it be slightly a hole-ish? Yeah. But it would be awesome rofl. I really don\u2019t have any good response other than to tell you I feel ya. But if that\u2019s the most annoying thing my husband does\u2026I\u2019d have to say I have it made.", "Just don\u2019t eat near her. I eat as far from my mom as possible because she does that too", "YWNTA. Omfg how awful. You\u2019re literally just trying to survive. If I was you, I\u2019d talk with my boyfriend about it. He may be numb to it and not even notice it, or he may be driven batshit crazy as well. Either way, I think it\u2019s his place to let her know that it\u2019s making you (and probably everyone else under the sun) uncomfortable. I don\u2019t think you would be unreasonable at all to decline invites to activities with them that include eating if it\u2019s not something that can be resolved. Honestly, she may not even realize she does it at this point and that can make it really hard to stop even if she wants to. Plenty of other things you can do together as a family than eat.\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t hesitated to make a disgruntled sigh at an audible volume after one of her moans during the meal if the moment was right.", "Watch when Harry met Sally... reenact that scene.", "Instead of saying anything start doing it yourself. Over-exaggerated mmmmmmm\u2019s. See if she takes the hint. If that doesn\u2019t work then speak up.", "Make up some awkward songs to go along with her moaning.", "YWBTA\n\nThe way this reads to me is that you live with her and she is eating at her own table?\n\nI agree that what she\u2019s doing is absolutely yucky BUT it would make you TA to tell someone how to eat food in their own home.\n\nI checked your page and you do live with MIL. In your 30s. And you are having intimacy problems. I\u2019m in my 30s and it would realllllllllly bother me if I lived with my boyfriends mom and I had to listen to her enjoy her food more than I have enjoyed her son. That would make me a little stabby lol. Still doesn\u2019t mean you should dictate how she eats at home.", "Nta - sounds like she\u2019s doing it on purpose. Does she do it when you aren\u2019t there? Have others said she does it when you are not around?\n\nAlso, you could try doing it too, see how she likes it.", "NTA That sounds super weird and would drive anyone crazy. I don\u2019t Ike that your bf isn\u2019t backing you up at all (I read that in one of your comments). He should at least acknowledge how offputting it is.", "NTA - ask her if she\u2019s ever seen the movie \u201cwhat about Bob\u201d \n\nAlso I second the comments about making it comical, moan back or heck even initiate your own moaning even if she\u2019s not doing it, then be surprised if / when she has a reaction. Maybe that\u2019s the only way to demonstrate how odd it is to moan and eat in-front of people \ud83d\ude1b", "Talk to your boyfriend about it. Do not embarrass his mother. The convo with him may not go any better with him than directly with the mom, but at least you won't embarrass her. I wouldn't be able to handle that either, though. Gross.", "NTA- Wow\u2026so many comments and not one just suggesting to ask her to stop? \u201cHey mil this might be awkward, but I\u2019ve noticed you kind of moan everytime you eat? Well it makes me a little uncomfortable. Would you mind trying not to? I\u2019d really appreciate it\u201d\n\nIf she\u2019s not a total bitch she\u2019ll just try to stop. You can even both probably laugh about it", "Yo call me up my hogs will take care of her", "I don't see how you can bring it up without making it awkward, but sure. NTA Maybe when it's just your wife and her around pause for half a minute next time she does it and casually ask \"by the way, why do you make a noise after every bite?\" I wouldn't push it further than that (and I **absolutely** would not call it 'moaning' to her). Let your wife kind of lead the conversation from there since it won't sound nearly as potentially sexual from a daughter. Knowing a SonIL noticed and finds it weird might be enough social shame to promote change.", "NTA to ask her to stop moaning when she eats. She can always say no, and then where will you be?", "Tell her it's bad table manners to make body noises when you eat. Slurping, moaning, smacking, chewing with your mouth open, etc.\n\nSlurp your food and when she gets upset, tell her you're trying to demonstrate to her how disruprive body noises are at the dinner table", "NTA\n\nWow, I don't know what to say.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
