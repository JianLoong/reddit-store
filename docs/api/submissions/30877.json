I agree with this. I'm the same with my FIL who eats with his mouth wide open, talks with food in his mouth, and constantly shovels food into it. It's disgusting and ruins my appetite. You have three options:\n\n1) moan back to make it awkward and demonstrate why you feel uncomfortable\n2) ask politely to eat somewhere else because the moaning makes you uncomfortable \n3) deal with it, it's just your future MIL. You'll hate her for other reasons anyway (trust me) \n\nI'd choose (1) because chaos is good\n\nIf your partner defends his mother, just remember he's probably Freud's plaything and has mummy issues.

Ive mentioned it to him before bc it is annoying. Seriously those sounds are for the bedroom dude\u2026not dinner. I was told I was rude (I was polite in how I phrased it.). If she feels you are rude for leaving the table maybe suggest she is rude for making bedroom sounds at the dinner table and it causes you to lose your appetite. Would it be slightly a hole-ish? Yeah. But it would be awesome rofl. I really don\u2019t have any good response other than to tell you I feel ya.

Either way, I think it\u2019s his place to let her know that it\u2019s making you (and probably everyone else under the sun) uncomfortable. I don\u2019t think you would be unreasonable at all to decline invites to activities with them that include eating if it\u2019s not something that can be resolved.

NTA Maybe when it's just your wife and her around pause for half a minute next time she does it and casually ask \"by the way, why do you make a noise after every bite?\" I wouldn't push it further than that (and I **absolutely** would not call it 'moaning' to her). Let your wife kind of lead the conversation from there since it won't sound nearly as potentially sexual from a daughter.
