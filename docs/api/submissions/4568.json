My husbands sister (28f) and I were best friends in high school and then grew apart once her brother and I got together. In my opinion, this has made her feel she can take extra liberties with my children and home, and take advantage of me sometimes. She is also one of those people who laugh and say \u201cOh I\u2019m blunt\u201d but really she\u2019s just rude. \n\nThe conflict is this: Over the weekend, my SIL stopped by my home while my kids were outside playing, opened the door to say Hi to me, and then said she was going to let me kids say hello to hers. I assumed she meant by opening the door to her vehicle. \nAbout 30 seconds later I see her vehicle driving off, and in a panic went to the door to put eyes on my youngest, only to notice all the kids were gone. As a mother, my first instinct is extreme panic when I don\u2019t see my kids. In this specific situation, I knew my SIL had them, and assumed she was driving down our road less than half a mile to take them to my Mother in Law\u2019s house. \nIn any other situation, this would have been fine, but I was immediately angry, because not only was I not asked, but she told me something different. \nMy MIL texted me within a minute to let me know my kids were there, and when my SIL brought them back (about 10 minutes later) she and I had words. I won\u2019t go in to detail, because I honestly don\u2019t remember my exact words, but the gist of it was, don\u2019t ever do that again or I swear to god. \nShe left and immediately called her brother, my husband, to complain about me, and tell him how I need to have respect for his family. When he and I spoke, he explained how he backed me up, but also doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s that big a deal because I knew the kids were with an adult and where they were. \nI remain convinced I\u2019m justified in being very upset, but after days of the cold shoulder from my SIL and my husband insisting it\u2019s no big deal, I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m overreacting.

What in the world, she drove away with your children without your permission, of course she's the asshole.", "NTA - did she even have the correct child seats for them?", "NTA-She took your children from your home without consent. It doesn\u2019t actually matter that you knew who had them. She had no right to take them.", "NTA. WHY WOULD YOU TAKE SOMEONE ELSE'S KIDS WITHOUT PERMISSION!??? You are absolutely right to be upset bc she basically kidnapped them. Just because it is family it is not right to take kids to somewhere else without informing the parents", "NTA, omg it\u2019s YOUR kids! She should have asked you even if it was only to your MIL\u2019s house", "I don\u2019t care how close you are or not, no one EVER takes my kids without clearing it with me first. NTA.", "NTA. If you yad let this pass, then it would be a free for all. She would never respect you as their mother, putting them in whichever situations she pleased without ever consulting you or even actively going against you.\n\nPiercing after mom said no? Just call auntie. Going on a cool trip and wanted to take kids without asking? Respect your husband's family. etc etc", "NTA. She put your kids in her car without telling you and took off! That is not a reasonable thing for anyone to do. It\u2019s amazing she\u2019s trying to defend herself. Even your MIL knew she was wrong, seeing as how she texted you right away.", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t *know* where the kids were.  You had a guess that fortunately turned out to be correct, but if not, there wouldn\u2019t have been anything you could do about it.  And there was no good reason for her not to *ask* whether it was okay for her to take the kids over there before she just went and did it unless she didn\u2019t *want* to give you a chance to say \u201cno,\u201d so she deprived you of the opportunity to act or make a decision there, too.  \n\nPut your foot down that she doesn\u2019t get to be around the kids at *least* until she\u2019s willing to acknowledge what she did wrong here.  And if your husband would rather downplay what she did than stand with you fully, maybe it\u2019s time to go to counseling to figure out why he finds it so hard to set boundaries with her.", "NTA. She wasn't a horrible monster kidnapping your children, but she did violate your boundaries. This just isn't a liberty you take with someone else's children.", "You are absolutely NTA- not even close. When a mother tells you that your actions with her children caused incredible fear and panic, then that is the end of it. A dignified SIL would have responded with contrition that her innocent intentions caused you such real dread. Instead, self righteousness was her priority. She may not have meant harm but she did cause it. Shame on her for her behavior. You are not overreacting. Her indignant reaction is beyond out of line.", "NTA. Did she even put the youngest in a car seat? Even if it\u2019s down the road she can still get into an accident. Your husband needs to back you up and tell his sister she can\u2019t just do that and needs to learn boundaries.", "She managed to put your 2 year old in a car in under 30 seconds? Damn... she must be magic.\n\nIn all serious, NTA. They are your kids. You are allowed to have boundaries around them. If you don't want SIL coming over and just grabbing them and taking them to your MILs that's your rule to set. I can also see how your SIL didn't think she was doing anything wrong. But again. It's your rule to set.", "NTA - You do not remove someone's kids from their property without their clear permission. What she did was kidnapping. This is not a minor situation. \n\nIt is nice that your husband backed you up, but if he doesn't agree that there needs to be a hard boundary against behavior like this then you and he need to have a serious conversation. Are you sure he got the full and true story from your SIL? It sounds like she is purposefully crossing boundaries (that should not even have to be set - I mean, kidnapping?) as a way to assert dominance within the family dynamic or to \"put you in your place\".", "NTA. They\u2019re not her kids. She\u2019s not entitled to lie and just take them, what was she thinking? I\u2019m glad your husband had your back, but he should help enforce that boundary (no kidnapping) more firmly. Her actions were very disrespectful.", "NTA.\n\nThere was no clear communication from her about what her words meant, and you had the fright of your life seeing your kids gone.  If she, as a mother, can't understand how much stress that put you under, then she needs to back off.\n\nYou have a bit of a husband problem here.  Yes he backed you but he needs to understand that it was a VERY BIG DEAL.  And NOT OKAY.\n\nRespect for family includes not running off with their kids unless they have clear permission to do so!!!!  Respect goes both ways!", "NTA - She STOLE your kids without your permission.  What she did was cruel and dangerous!  Did she have carseats for your kids?\n\nSimple rule of thumb is to NEVER take someone's kids without their EXPRESS permission.", "NTA\n\nShe took your kids without permission. I would be PISSED and ban her from my home until she apologizes. (How'd she open the door\u2014she has a key? Time to take it back.)", "NTA this is literally how kids get stolen.", "NTA \n\nTaking the kids without a word is a big NO NO. All she had to do was pop in and say hey I am gonna take the kids over here. Its not difficult and displays the bare minimum of respect. SIL is TAH and should have apologized. If she had apologized right away it wouldnt be a big deal. Instead she tried to make the situation your fault. Your husband needs to stop and think about the fear that missing children can cause. You assumed that she had them but without confirmation you are reasonable in worrying for a moment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She LIED to you", "NTA... Taking kids without parents permission equals kidnapping... Also the fact that she doesn't have the correct car seats.  I'm not a mom and I know better than to drive a child anywhere without a safety seat. All it would take is her backing out of the driveway to get hit by a SUV and the ending wouldn't be pretty.", "NTA \n\nShe literally kidnapped your children by the definition of the law! Next time she does that call the police! That\u2019s seriously unhinged behavior!", "NTA. And you are a better woman than me.

SIL needed to ask you and inform you correctly about her kidnapping plan.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour SIL on the other hand really needs a wake-up call. If that ever happens again, I'd threaten her with a kidnapping charge because that's exactly what that was.\n\nI'm known in my family to not care one bit about denouncing crimes, even by close family members, so you might not want to go all the way there. But your SIL was totally out of line.", "NTA at all. She literally took you kids and didn\u2019t tell you where she was going!!! I would have freaked out also.", "NTA i would have called the cops as soon as she left", "NTA - Frankly you handled the situation better than I would have. Point blank I would have more than just words for her. Husband also needs to get his head on straight and have some hard boundaries with his sister.", "NTA. I don't think there is an overreaction possible when a child goes missing from under your nose. This would be a good time to teach your kids to always give you a heads up before going anywhere. \"Mom, auntie no brains is taking us to grammas\" regardless of whether auntie says you okayed it or not.", "NTA\n\nThink about it. Your mother in law called within a minute of the kids arriving to let you know they were there.

We live 2 driveways down from my in laws, so I know that it wasn\u2019t a priority of hers, but I also know that a huge percentage of car accidents happen within 5 miles of home, and everyone in the family knows I\u2019m a stickler for proper carseat safety. Even my 8 year old who already meets height and weight requirements for no booster is still in one because I just don\u2019t feel he\u2019s responsible to stay properly seated without one.", "That was my first thought!  Some of the children are too young to be sitting in a regular vehicle seat - no matter how short the distance is!", "My husband and I have dealt with boundary issues with his family before. Unfortunately. He has grown a LOT in the years we\u2019ve been together, but finds it so hard to enter into conflict with them, because all the women in his family are very emotionally and mentally abusive toward the men, and it\u2019s basically ingrained in him to downplay any conflict, even if he fully takes my side on the matter. We\u2019re definitely working on it, but I know he\u2019s so anxious because it\u2019s almost Christmas and he wants the issues gone before we all get together.

At all.", "I know she doesn\u2019t think she did anything wrong, and objectively I can also understand how she thinks I\u2019m being silly, but the fact of the matter is she said one thing, did another, and then my kids were gone, and THATS the issue I have here. With everything I see on the news DAILY of children being taken/hurt/abused/killed, my heart just stopped dead.", "He did get the full story, because I think she knew I would be talking to him about it! And she\u2019s definitely very assertive, all the women in his family make it a habit to undermine me and do the opposite of what I\u2019ve said (no you can\u2019t have candy, oh here\u2019s a candy type things), but my husband is so non confrontational and is having anxiety about the situation, he wants it resolved by Christmas and I am just not willing to stand down and apologize. I would NEVER have done that with her children. Never.", "I was inside my house cooking dinner, elbow deep in raw chicken, the kids were playing in the front yard, where I can see them from open front door and windows. The older kids make sure the younger don\u2019t go past our invisible boundaries (driveway, road, backyard where I can\u2019t see).
