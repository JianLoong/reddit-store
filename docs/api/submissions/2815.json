You have bodily autonomy, you owe neither of them anything, even access to your pregnant belly. Not every pregnant woman parades their belly around for attention, and they certainly don\u2019t want people, strangers or family, touching them. \n\nI would notify your leasing office about your erratic mother and sister, ask them to change your locks (they\u2019ll likely charge you, but it\u2019s worth the peace of mind). Consider changing your cell phone number, too. \n\nI would also go so far as to tell your doctors about your mother and sister, so they can\u2019t access your patient files (they have your personal info, and can impersonate you over the phone). When you go to the hospital to deliver, ensure your nurses know about your family circumstances.\n\nAnd for your health and safety, don\u2019t go chasing down your mother in an Uber. The fact she sent you on a wild goose chance to avoid you is alarming enough, but your health and sanity aren\u2019t worth those two. \n\nConsider going no contact for a long while.", "NTA....I hate when people act like this.

You are NTA and I agree strongly with everyone else who is saying you should change your locks. And don't chase after your mum when she's acting crazy. Right now you have ONE responsibility - to youself and the little person in side (well okay, that's two responsibilities, lol). But that's where your responsibilities end.

If you are really an adult then act like one & answer your damn phone. You\u2019re the one being erratic. If you\u2019re so worried that your mom might copy your key just change your lock.
