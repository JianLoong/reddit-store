For about three years, I was a bit overweight, by about 20 lbs/9 kg overweight at 5\u20198\u201d/173 cm.\n\nFor some reason, this invited all kinds of shaming and nasty comments from my coworkers, despite some of them being significantly chubbier than I was for their height and build. I never would make comments on their bodies, and would generally just awkwardly smile or say \u201coh\u201d. I\u2019d get comments about how fat I was all of the time, for years.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve lost some weight. 34 lbs/15 kg. I now weigh 150 lbs at 5\u20198\u201d, or 68 kg at 173 cm. This is a perfectly normal weight for a woman of my height. \n\nNow, guess what. At first, my coworkers were all asking how I\u2019ve been losing weight, asking if I\u2019m taking medication (no but it\u2019s none of their business), what exactly I\u2019m eating. One of them, who is obviously obese, but is 4\u20199\u201d/155 cm keeps pointing out how huge and chunky I was before and now I\u2019m not. \n\nAccording to my coworkers now I\u2019m too thin, they\u2019re asking why I\u2019m skinny, \u201cmy face was more beautiful before\u201d, and I look \u201csick.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve been getting these kinds of comments regularly for the past few weeks but yesterday they crossed the line by saying that I look sick, and deliberately telling me that I need to stop. Another obese coworker who is 4\u20199\u201d/155 cm started giving me diet advice, told me to eat my normal diet because I\u2019m exercising more now and to regain weight. \n\nIt was the last straw yesterday. I am a quiet girl who has never raised my voice ever before at work. I stood in the center of the kitchen, and yelled \n\n\u201cEveryone, needs to SHUT THE FUCK UP about my body. No one, should be talking about my fucking body. I\u2019m never enough for any of you, and I don\u2019t want to hear it anymore. All of you, need to SHUT THE FUCK UP\u201d \n\nThe whole place went quiet, I walked away for a bit, and then apologized for my language. One told me, they are concerned for me. The same woman said I was fat a year ago. \n\nI told them it\u2019s none of their business and I\u2019m never enough for them, and those kinds of comments are inappropriate at work regardless despite of intent. One tried to spin it as compliments and I said, regardless of intent it\u2019s inappropriate and I don\u2019t want to hear about it. \n\nI snapped. I finally snapped.

What tests would you advise and what diagnosis do you suspect?\" Make them be overly specific because it's almost certain that they don't think you have an actual illness, more the old common wisdom type thing that my grandma would always say: you need a couple extra inches [of body fat] in case you are ever in surgery and they slip.\" No kidding, she was an LPN and told all her kids & grandkids that.
