Mom filed for divorce due to my father having hook ups and not contributing financially to the family budget forcing my hardworking mom to maintain the household all by herself and taking care of their two young children while getting minimum wage.\nHe said that he is willing to leave the house to mom if he gets quite a huge amount of money. My whole maternal side of the family helped mom to pay it. He was the best weekend daddy we could imagine. Taking us every weekend to nice places and fancy restaurants. It lasted for about a year when the money was gone. So was my father. I haven't seen him since. As he was a better father after the divorce then he was ever before it broke my heart. After a month not seeing him I begged mom to let me talk to him (mom called him numerous times during that month as she saw that we miss him, but he always had excuses). He agreed to talk to me via phone. He promised me he will visit me on Thursday. The only problem is that he forgot to mention which Thursday as 18 years has passed by and I still haven't seen him. About 7 years ago he wrote me on Messenger claiming that he misses me and that he's sick and needs help. I didn't even tell him to f off. I just blocked him and deleted the message. He kept making new accounts and messaging me basically the same shit for about a year. I always did the same. Block and delete. I haven't heard of him for about 6 years now and if I am lucky I never will. If he was showing up at my door I would call the police on him immediately.\n\nF off shitty parents.
