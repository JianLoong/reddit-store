Abby babysat for me sometimes and was happy to watch my son when I needed a rest. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI badly wanted a baby shower and to feel celebrated even in a small way, but my parents said they could not help, as they were stressed about the situation. I didn't have many friends, so I asked Abby and Megan. Abby was sympathetic, but Megan said she wouldn't help out at all. She told me that a teen pregnancy was not something to be celebrated. Abby just kind of followed what she said and I ended up never getting a baby shower. I always kinda regret that because I doubt I'll have another child. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I'm doing okay. I graduated from community college, I have an apartment where I live with my son, I have a good co-parenting relationship with his dad. Abby announced her pregnancy some time ago, and her baby shower was this weekend. Of course I went. She made a little speech and thanked 'Aunt' Megan for organizing the entire thing.

I told her that I was hurt that she would do all this for Abby but nothing for me. She awkwardly said they were two different situations and I shouldn't make this a big deal on Abby's day.

Nobody's frontal lobe was fully developed in this situation.  \n\nAnd let's be honest if your sixteen year old son got his girlfriend pregnant in six years, how would you respond?

I would have thought that Megan would have matured enough to acknowledge her mistake in the manner in which she treated you and your son.  If all the births in this world were done the right way our population would suffer a major shrink.  Every life is precious. And how amazing that you didn\u2019t internalize whatever messed up ideas Megan has.  You are a good mother and are doing your best to better yourself and raise your son.  You should feel very proud of that.  If there is shame it belongs to your sisters, for not celebrating the birth of their nephew.  Things need to be acknowledged and how can your sister Abby fully enjoy her baby shower without first acknowledging a wish that you had also experienced the same.

But I do have a few thoughts for you. \n\n1. While it is normal to feel sad about the things that you didn't have, you should at least try to be thankful for the things that you did have. \n\nLike supportive parents who paid for your pre and post pregnancy care, delivery care and your child's doctor visits during at least the first few years of his life. Supportive parents and at least one supportive sister who babysat your son. The list goes on here and you only know the exact details.\n\n\n2. When a teenage child becomes pregnant, the entire family goes  through an emotional turmoil; even if the parents decide to put on a brave face. So, while I don't condone Megan's past actions, I see where she is coming from. \n\n\n3. Maybe Megan saw what your parents were really going through and felt bad for them and hence blamed your pregnancy for all that. Again, Megan herself wasn't that old either at that time. She was just a college kid, younger than you are right now. Maybe she didn't have the emotional maturity  to handle all that. \n\n4. Maybe she was just closer to Abby than she is to you. All siblings need not be equally close.\n\nSo what I'm trying to say here is, I feel for you. But at least try to be happy for Abby right now. From what you say; she is the sister who was there for you back then,  right?", "NAH. It has been a decade. People grow, people change. She likley has more cash now to be asked to throw around, something a 21-year-old wouldn't have had. NTA for feeling like you missed out, but she is right. Circumstances are different. And I don't mean that in saying your teen pregnancy was wrong or you or you baby aren't to be celebrated, but HER circumstances, life experience, etc. are VERY different. She also isn't having to watch her parents scramble to care for her sister, which would have caused stress for the entire family and probably some resentment once she was asked to throw a party on top of that.", "YTA. I wonder how much time Megan was expected to \"watch\" OP and other sister when they were younger. I wonder how OP treated Megan during that time? I just have a feeling that maybe Megan was tired of so much of the family's energy and resources being spent on managing OP both before and after the teen pregnancy.", "NTA. You took responsibility for your actions and made it out okay even without Megan\u2019s help. Sure, it\u2019s not your sisters job to babysit. but she was evil about it. From calling your son a mistake to saying he shouldn\u2019t be celebrated with a baby shower. It\u2019s not so much a celebration as it is helping you get a head start on being a mother. Abby was helpful when you needed it and for Megan to do a 180 for her would be hurtful. Plus, you didn\u2019t make a scene when you left the baby shower, so I don\u2019t really see anything you did wrong", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA. These are two completely different circumstances and there is a difference between a child having child and adult having a child.\nPlus the whole my parents helped financially even though it came from my college fund, like I\u2019m sorry where did you expect it come from?", "YTA. You took so, so much more money and energy from your family than your sister did for one baby shower. I assume your parents paid for your care, food, home for you and baby at least until 18, yes? Are they doing that for your sister? I\u2019m guessing not. It sucks you didn\u2019t ALSO get a party, but a little bratty to whine about it.", "YTA. \n\n'She awkwardly said they were two different situations and I shouldn't make this a big deal on Abby's day'\n\nShe was right - this was the time to say ok, talk later. Not to 'get into it' and then leave Abby's shower early. That sucks for Abby.\n\nIt sucks that you didn't get a babyshower but it's not exactly unsurprising given the circumstances, sadly.\n\nA 21 year old and a 31 year old are generally two very different people. 21 year old me would have been fuming if my 16 year old sister asked me to babysit. 31 year old me would love to babysit for her.", "YTA. You had a child 10 years ago.  All of you were in a different place.  It\u2019s very different with an unplanned  teen pregnancy than a pregnancy for someone in her mid-20s.", "NAH but I would seriously reevaluate your relationship with Megan and couldn\u2019t really blame you if you decided one sister in your life is enough, in other words stop wasting your energy on that loser", "NAH.\n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are really wrong.\n\nMegan was completely entitled to stay out of your pregnancy and was essentially a child herself with no real money of her own to throw you a shower. Even your parents couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nBut I completely understand your feelings too. Part of owning your decision to have a child is also to celebrate that, and you didn\u2019t have anyone willing to do that with you. It sucks. I absolutely understand how being at a baby shower for your sister, thrown by the sister who stayed out of your pregnancy, would bring up difficult feelings. \n\nIt is a tough situation and I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge those feelings, but now that you have, I think all of you should move forward together. There\u2019s no changing the past, but it sounds like there is hope for the future.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\n\nYou know that just because she\u2019s your sister she doesn\u2019t have to be your friend right?", "YTA. There is absolutely no reason to celebrate a teen pregnancy. You created a burden for everyone living in that home. You cannot expect people to babysit for you or love your child if you make the child when you are 16. It probably changed the whole dynamic of the home.", "INFO; \n\nShe couldn\u2019t support you then, but has she since? If she has, then you need to let it go.\n\nYou were a scared 16 year old, you had your parents but you also wanted your sisters to be there for you. That\u2019s understandable. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s not about the baby shower\u2026\n\nP.S. Your parents were great helping you and your child, they helped you beat odds against you, and you sound like you\u2019re doing well. Be proud, you made it!", "NTA. \n\nand I'd like to quickly address the comments because JFC some are cruel. Yes a teen pregnancy is nothing to celebrate, but it was already happening. You were going to be a mom regardless, so to have robbed at least a bit of comfort during a scary time is cruel of them to have done. A baby shower for you wouldn't have been focused on celebration but having a official gathering with all your friends and family coming together, letting you know it's going to be alright, giving you their little parenting advices, getting you some baby necessities, and just an easy party to relax before everything gets harder would've been the bare minimum in my family. \n\nTo be a bit upset you didn't get one yet your sister got a very enthusiastic one is gonna dying regardless. \n\nPerhaps you should've gotten \"into it\" with your sister at the baby shower but your emotions are valid and normal.", "NTA. Your sister didn't have to throw you a baby shower when you got pregnant (I also understand why you wanted one and why it was and still is sad that your baby wasn't celebrated). But she should have been kinder to you -- her refusal even to watch the baby so you could rest was cruel and makes it seem like she wanted to punish you. And it would have been nice if, with time, Megan could have reflected and been kinder about what happened in the past.", "NAH. Of course you wanted support and celebration just like anyone else. It\u2019s normal to be disappointed. But the situations are totally different. And your sister is also older now and more ready to be an aunt", "NTA.\n\nActions have consequences, and Megan's decisions cast a long shadow. She owes you an apology, some sort of closure. She doesn't get to tell you to put your emotions and pain away in some closet while you pretend to be happy for Abby's sake. That's not fair to you. Your response is reasonable here.", "YTA. \n\nYou aren't the AH for being hurt that your pregnancy wasn't as celebrated as your sisters. \n\nYour sister isn't the AH for not wanting to celebrate her 16 y/o sister getting pregnant or for not treating it like a great situation.  \n\nYTA for expecting people to respond to the situations the same way and for not recognizing the difference.  And YTA for taking attention from your sister at her baby shower.", "NTA", "YTA bc you decided to have it out with Megan at an event for Abby. No, you didn't get a party, but Abby was good to you. Abby was there for you. Wouldn't you want to celebrate her having a child? No need to be friendly with Megan, but you could have had it out with her at a later date.", "YTA mostly because this wasn\u2019t the time or the place for this conversation. I think you need to understand that there is a big difference between your situation and your sister\u2019s. You were a teen mom completely financially dependent on your parents, and your sister was in college. Things are different now, everyone is financially independent, Megan probably has the time and money to help with these sorts of things, and Abby isn\u2019t depending on anyone to financially support her. Circumstances play a big role in what we get in life, having a kid at 16 typically doesn\u2019t lead to the best circumstances and you can\u2019t always get what you want.", "Nta  I would take it personally as well. Maybe not the day to bring it up but she came and asked you what was wrong", "YTA.Megan was right\u2014a teen pregnancy is nothing to celebrate about.You also had your parent\u2019s financial support which was probably a lot of money since babies are expensive.Instead of being grateful for your family\u2019s support,you wanted a baby shower too.You made it worse by telling Abby and making her feel bad.I think that being the youngest,your parents let you get away with things.Your reaction was also bratty when Megan set boundaries with you regarding baby care.", "NTA. You have the right to be upset about the way this was handled back then. The passage of time doesn't change the hurt and it was okay for you to quietly excuse yourself. Yes, there is a big difference between 21 year old Megan and 31 year old Megan but her actions are her actions and she was the one who started the confrontation.", "NTA. A shower isn\u2019t just about celebrating the pregnancy. It is about helping the new mom with items to make her transition to a new role easier. Babies require a lot of expense up front. While I get not wanting to make the experience look like a great fun time for your teenage peers, You needed that help even more than the average first time mom. It also would have helped out your parents who took on more than most grandparents have to.", "NTA.  That\u2019s going to hurt.  \n\nI feel like there\u2019s often a way to find middle ground.

Megan is a proper asshat.", "NAH, you're allowed to feel like you missed out on these fun things. But they couldn't do those things because of obvious stress, and most already supported you in different ways anyway. Teen pregnancy isn't something to be celebrated, but teen parents shouldn't be punished or insulted", "YTA.

I don't think you should have made a scene at Abby's baby shower since she's not the one who slighted you but your feelings are completely valid.

Just hopefully you remember that Abby doesn't deserve your resentment.", "NTA a shower isn\u2019t just congratulatory, it\u2019s also to help the new mom get the baby things she needs, something I think a teen mom would need.. sorry your family didn\u2019t throw you a shower.", "NAH. I am sorry that you missed out on so much excitement. Even when times are challenging, you still want milestones celebrated. Unfortunately, there are consequences to all actions and neither you or your sisters are in the same place now as you were then. Having a baby at 16 is extremely different than 28. And throwing a babyshower is something a 31 year old does, not a college student focused on school work. \n\nYour son is not a mistake, but getting pregnant was an accident. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to celebrate accidents. All you can do now is focus on the good you have.", "Nta", "YTA, I get why you're upset but you're expecting too much of a 21 year old and an 18 year old. It wasn't their job to babysit or throw you a baby shower.", "YTA", "YTA softly - the situations are different, Megan was clear she didn\u2019t support you being a teen mom and wasn\u2019t going to be supportive of it. Abby is not a teen mom, and Megan is supportive. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that view of Megan\u2019s, there\u2019s also nothing wrong with you wishing you had a baby shower, but it is also one of the potential consequences that was made clear when you choose to be a teen mom. If you had waited until adulthood, you would have gotten your shower, you live with your choices.\n\nTo a lot of people baby showers are celebrations, not everyone celebrates teenage parenthood. Teen parents often require heavy support because they\u2019re children who cannot take care of themselves yet alone another being, they take it from the government, families, and communities - it\u2019s simply just not the same celebratory time.", "NTA as you said, accidents happen and I bet you wouldn\u2019t be without your son. Your sister sounds nasty, and the other one is probably feeling caught in the middle. Hold your head high that you\u2019ve managed to get an education, whilst being a single parent and are now living in your own apartment. You should be really proud of your achievements.

At that point in your sister's life, she didn't want anything to do with your son, she certainly didn't have the funds, and there is no requirement that she help you out.\n\nAt 31, your sister is more stable financially (presumably), more mature, and takes a greater interest in her new nibling. She isn't an AH for this. You're comparing apples and oranges. I never even held an infant until I was in my 30s. Just wasn't a fan of kids or babies. You couldn't pay me to watch children as soon as I got my license and could work a job in highschool. \n\nIt sounds like your middle sister was supportive of you and took your son into consideration when she was also just a teenager. And you basically punished her for your older sister behaving like a 21 yo. \n\nYTA. You can feel how you feel, and you're not an asshole for feeling that way, but you didn't need to involve your middle sister in it. You should have been happy for her on her day celebrating your nearly nibling. But you effectively punished your pregnant sister who was supportive of you.", "YTA. You had a teen pregnancy and were an absolute burden to your family. I completely get why a person wouldn\u2019t want to celebrate your situation. You took joy away from Abby\u2019s day. Those are completely different situations.", "YTA. It wasn't her responsibility to throw you anything. If you wanted one badly enough, throw one yourself. Or why didn't the dad's family throw you one? \n\nThere is a gigantic difference between a 16 year old getting pregnant and a grown woman being pregnant. If you can't understand that, idk what to tell you. Your sister is right that teen pregnancy shouldn't be celebrated.", "Nta. Your sister made her decision, and now she gets to deal with the consequences of being a jerk to you when you were young.\n\nIt's awesome that you were able to graduate from both high school and college! It's not too late to celebrate if you have good friends. Even if it's not a baby shower, you can throw a little celebration for your achievements. And don't invite your sister.", "NAH in 2023- but Megan totally was 10 years ago. You\u2019re absolutely entitled to your feelings. But your sisters were 18 and 21 when you were pregnant.

I hope you can be happy for your sister and allow this to blow over.", "YTA lightly\n\nI\u2019m going to venture a guess that Megan\u2019s attitude 10 years ago was that she was likely the one regularly babysitting and giving up parts of her life for her two younger sisters, as what happens a lot with oldest children, and she was not in the mood to help with a third child she had no responsibility for. \n\nAlso, Megan was 21 at the time. How did you expect her to throw you a shower? A decent baby shower can be a few hundred to even a couple thousand dollars. Money most 21 year olds don\u2019t have lying around. Why didn\u2019t your parents throw you a shower? Probably for the same reason she didn\u2019t. \n\nShe also had a point that teen pregnancy isn\u2019t something to be celebrated. You got a lot more support than most children would\u2019ve at the time. They had money ready to help and you had babysitters so you could get a degree and gain some independence. You sulking over not getting a party 10 years ago is a tad bratty. \n\nThere\u2019s absolutely a difference between a 16 year old who accidentally got pregnant before she could vote and turning everyone\u2019s lives upside down and a grown adult who\u2019s likely financially independent and mature getting pregnant and not needing the support the teenager did. We generally celebrate the latter.", "YTA.\n\nThe situation 10 years ago cannot be compared to the situation now. Megan was 21, she saw her 16 year old sister \"throw away\" her life by getting pregnant. She had a justified \"fear\" of being used as a nanny. You said your parents were very stressed by the situation, which probably also affected your sisters. It is not very illogical that she was not enthusiastic about your pregnancy.\n\nMaybe I'm not the right person. I didn't even want a baby shower at all, I think it's extremely nonsensical that others have to buy things for your baby. I also never go to baby showers (and I think gender reveal parties are even worse).\n\nBut now that you are 26, with a 10-year-old child, you can imagine that it was not a party at all for the people around you, that you were pregnant so young. It caused a lot of stress in the family. That doesn't mean your son is less loved now, but it was just a totally different situation.\n\nBut the reason you're YTA is that you didn't keep your feelings to yourself until after the baby shower.

Do you need to cut ties with Megan?  INFO  eta add 4 words", "I agree with Megan, teen pregnancy shouldn\u2019t be celebrated. You fucked up, and while you took responsibility and made it work, you still got pregnant at 16.

Your feelings are completely valid. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nTo me this just reeks of judgmental bullshit. People have intended and unintended pregnancies at many ages, and I think for your (older) sister to be so cruel is inexcusable. Is an unintended pregnancy at 40 (or any age) any more or less cause for celebration?\n\nYou have every right to feel hurt, and you didn\u2019t make a scene and ruin Abby\u2019s party. You dealt with these feelings like a responsible adult by excusing yourself. It seems like Megan now realizes what an AH she was earlier and is being extra defensive by lashing out.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid. A baby shower doesn't \"celebrate teen pregnancy,\" it helps a family provide much needed items. Having a baby shower wouldn't have changed anything except made you feel like your family had your back. You already knew they didn't approve or condone anything. \n\nI saw someone ask how Megan treats your son now- this is very important, I think. Is she a good aunt, or is she withholding or aloof?", "NTA.\n\nAnd I\u2019m so proud of you for graduating community college, getting your own place, still maintaining a good co-parenting relationship with your son\u2019s dad, and even going to the babyshower.\n\nYou tried not to make a scene, but you are only human. \n\nYou sound like a good mom and I\u2019m so sorry that your sister Megan was - and still is- so judgy and mean. You and your son both deserve better.\n\nI don\u2019t care about what age you got pregnant, all I care about is the baby having a loving, caring and responsible mother (and father). \n\nAgain, because I bet you haven\u2019t heard this enough:\n\nI\u2019m proud of you.", "NAH. You\u2019re nta for feeling resentful or upset or quietly leaving Abby\u2019s shower or telling Megan how you felt. All of that is your right and totally understandable. I\u2019m sure it hurts to watch Abby\u2019s pregnancy get celebrated in a way your pregnancy did not. You did nothing wrong. Your hurt feelings are justified.\n\nHowever, Megan is nta for her feelings either. Could she have been kinder? Sure. But she doesn\u2019t have to throw you a baby shower for your accidental teen pregnancy if she doesn\u2019t feel the desire to. It sounds like the important financial support was there for you from your parents. However, the emotional support from your family/community was probably lacking. Unfortunately, people aren\u2019t always going to emotionally support your choices that they don\u2019t agree with. That\u2019s their right, too.\n\nNo one is the a\u2014hole in this situation. Everyone\u2019s just entitled to their different feelings. Megan didn\u2019t affirmatively harm you, she just didn\u2019t agree to do anything extra for you that one might normally do in such circumstances. Although it would have been a nice gesture, she had no obligations to babysit your child or throw you a baby shower. She could have kept her options on the situation too herself but I imagine you probably asked her about a baby shower and that\u2019s why she made her disapproval of your situation clear by stating that she was not celebrating the situation. Again, not kind or empathetic, but within her rights to feel that way. \n\nThe real issue is did you have necessary financial support to raise your child as you would have needed that at 16. I imagine/hope that your parents still helped ensure that your baby had the needed supplies even without a party/baby shower? If so, then the shower was just extra. The main purpose of a shower was still fulfilled.\n\nWas it the dreamy, perfect vision of a pregnancy that Abby had? No. But Megan didn\u2019t owe you that and your situations dictated some of that difference. I understand that hurts you, but it\u2019s not  ultimately a hurt that is Megan\u2019s responsibility.\n\nThe bigger issue for me would be does Megan treat your child well\u2014like an aunt should. Does she treat your child the same as Abby\u2019s? If so, that\u2019s all she is required to do. If not, I\u2019d remove her from my life.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your pain. I hope you find joy in your beautiful child and the success you\u2019ve achieved despite challenging circumstances.", "Soft YTA. I'm sorry you went through that, but you have to remember that your sisters were also quite young. A pregnancy at an age when you're really completely unprepared to be a parent can send ripples of stress through an entire family, especially if your siblings were still at home. It probably did not feel like something they wanted to celebrate. It sounds like you got all the material needs for your child met. I mean, I would not want my daughter to get pregnant and keep the pregnancy at that age.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re old enough now to know these are two different situations with people aging and maturing between those times. You ALSO knew this baby shower would have the attendants celebrating the mother. You should\u2019ve prepared yourself emotionally to deal with that ahead of time but you acted surprised and left. \n\nReally sit with it and think about why everything was different. Accept your responsibility now as an adult with how you act on your emotions.\n\nNow you have your pregnant sister feeling bad for you when it could\u2019ve been avoided. You had plenty of years to address any resentment you had with your other sister, it didn\u2019t have to be right this moment in your pregnant sister\u2019s celebration.", "NTA. I feel strongly about this. Yes, NOT ideal that you got pregnant at 16. I\u2019m not encouraging it, but I would have never treated you like your older sister did. Yes, having a child is a choice. No, she doesn\u2019t HAve to babysit. But is it really so hard to be nice? Does she treat you better now thst she\u2019s older and happy about babies being born by her sister? Or will she always think, ew how terrible my nephew is born of a teen mother. I was born from a teen mother. I was thought of by the family to be a teen mother one day and that\u2019s just disgusting to treat someone like a stereotype or statistic. We\u2019re all people with feelings. So no, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re out of line. But it\u2019s also ok for you to go low contact or even no contact with people who treat you badly. And IM PROUD OF YOU. You took a hard circumstance and did the best you can do with it. That\u2019s what matters!", "> But accidents happen right?\n\nIt is kinda crazy to read this regarding human life.", "It\u2019s ok for you to feel your feelings. It\u2019s ok for Megan to point out that this is very different situation. These are adults, planning a celebration for adults, in a way that is entirely normal. There\u2019s no reason 18 and 21 year olds should be obligated to celebrate their 16 year old sister\u2019s unexpected baby. \n\nI would say N A H, except that Megan was absolutely right that you should not be using this moment, which should be Abby\u2019s, to air your grievance. \n\nFor that, YTA", "NTA Look family is supposed to help even when it sucks.  They did not.  So maybe you go find better family.  Especially when they were punishing you for having a baby.  Let sis do all the work.  If someone complains tell them it was their decision to get pregnant. Every time. They want to brush how they treated you under the rug. Be bold remind them of how they were.  10 years of abuse for having a teen pregnancy. I would have no chill", "YTA, she could have been more supportive back then but it\u2019s very different to at 20/21 throw a baby shower for your teen sister versus at 31 do it for your adult sister. Yes she could have helped babysit, but I don\u2019t think she was wrong for not throwing you a party. \n\nI think it\u2019s rather unusual to have a baby shower for a teen pregnancy as you\u2019re likely not financially equipped to pay for all your needs on your own so your family is already having to pay so much - a party celebrating that is a bit odd. \n\nIt\u2019s a hard pill to swallow but when you don\u2019t do things the \u201cright\u201d way you\u2019re not going to have a lot of people celebrating you. Being bitter about it and complaining when someone did things the more responsible way, is bad on your part.", "YTA. Your parents couldn't help with a baby shower but you expected your 18 and 21 year old sisters to throw one? With what money??? I think it's selfish to expect your sister who is a full time college student and your other sister who is just about to graduate from High School to lay out a bunch of money for a baby shower.\n\nYou also said you didn't have many friends. So who would your sisters even invite? What would your teenage friends even be able to gift you?? Certainly not any of the items you would REALLY need. Maybe a cute outfit the baby would outgrow in a couple of months. \n\nIf your parents, his parents, aunt's or other adult relatives can't/won't throw you a baby shower, sorry, you don't get a baby shower. If grown adults can't manage, it's extremely unfair to expect your teen and barely out of her teens sisters to do it.", "NAH. This is a very different situation to your pregnancy. You were still a child, having a child. Your sister had the right to not want to be involved, especially if she was worried about being used for free childcare. \n\nYou have every right to feel however you feel. They have every right to celebrate your sister\u2019s pregnancy. \n\nMegan was right that teen pregnancy isn\u2019t something to celebrate. Could she have been kinder? Yes. But she was in college and didn\u2019t want to help raise a baby that wasn\u2019t hers.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m glad you and your son are doing well, that is very nice to hear. However, I think you need to understand that a decade has passed and people change. Your sister is probably not the same person she was ten years ago. \n\nFurthermore, teen pregnancy is not something that should be celebrated. The money that it would take to host a baby shower should be saved for you and your baby. The reality is teen pregnancies do not have those luxuries.\n\nThe only reason i\u2019m not saying YTA, is because i don\u2019t believe your actions are out of spite or intentionally mean. You just need to view the situation more objectively and stop letting your emotions cloud your judgment.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't really about a shower. Irs about having support from your sister's, which you never got.\n\nI don't blame you for feeling hurt about it. And their response kinda sucked. Brushing it off instead of apologizing.", "I\u2019m going with a soft NTA. You\u2019re right in how you feel. You didn\u2019t deserve to be shamed for your mistake by anyone let alone your sister. it was good on you that you weren\u2019t holding it against your pregnant sister, and stepping away from the situation when you were emotionally charged. However I still think that you could have told Megan exactly what you told us. It wasn\u2019t the right time/place for that discussion", "I\u2019m going with NAH. You are entitled to your feelings. Understandable even. However, a teen pregnancy is very different than an adult one. Your sisters aren\u2019t AHs for not throwing you a baby shower. I suggest you have a sit down conversation with your sisters and work on getting past your hurt. I was not kind when my teenage sister got pregnant. I tried to be present but I also had my own life to live. Who I was back then is not who I am now and I have a close bond with all my nieces and nephews. You can be hurt but also try to understand where she was coming from. People saying to go no contact or whatever are dumb as hell. If you have a relationship with your siblings and would like to continue having a relationship talk it out.", "YTA - the main reason here is you don\u2019t seem to see why Megan would have been resentful/unhappy that you\u2019re pregnant at 16. Think of it from her pov, she\u2019s 21 and probably either a junior or senior in college. Her home is now going to have a newborn in it and her parents are too busy giving their time and energy to her 16 year old pregnant sister than help Megan figure out what to do post college - how to apply for jobs, be there as emotional support, etc. \n\nEspecially considering it sounds like they did the bulk of the work taking care of you and your kid. Also, with a 5 year age gap, she probably babysat you and your sister a lot growing up.\n\nI would have said N A H except you caused a scene at Abby\u2019s baby shower. You really do sound like the stereotypical youngest child that has to make everything about them.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NAH mostly. You have the right to still be hurt, but you were all very young. I do think Megan owes you an apology for the way she treated you, especially if she cares about your son. You made an effort to not make it about you, but she was the one who followed you inside.", "Nah!", "How is Megan and your sons relationship now? When or did she ever get over it and start acting like an aunt?", "YTA. Not for wanting a shower, but for bringing it up on Abby\u2019s special day. I don\u2019t think Megan was very kind, but you don\u2019t need to ruin Abby\u2019s event about it. I\u2019m not going to dig on you for being a teen mom though.", "YTA for getting upset then, during the shower, and not addressing the issue with Megan another time. Specifically, because you say Abby was sympathetic, babysat sometimes, and granted you rest when you needed it most. The emotion is understandable. The jealousy, not so much. It was Abby's shower you walked out on, and now she feels guilty for the occasion. This should have been discussed later, and not become an issue during her shower.", "YTA - but only because it was Abby\u2019s baby shower and she was the sister that was very supportive of you during a hard time and even did babysitting for you. You should have rewarded Abby by being elated for her, but instead you chose to focus on the jaded sister being happy for Abby. It sounds like you want Megan\u2019s approval and when she obviously didn\u2019t give it to you collateral damage was inflicted upon Abby\u2019s happy time. On a side note, screw being friends with Megan. Focus on being closer with Abby.", "YTA. Meghan is right. This isn't about you. Abby is a 28-year-old woman, not a 16-year-old girl. They're very different situations. It sounds like this baby was planned and they're in a good place in life to be able to have a child.\n\nChildren having children is not a celebratory event. It's great that it turned out well for you, but it's not a positive situation. And bringing a human life into the world is more important than what you get out of it.", "Soft YTA - you made Abby feel bad on a day she was celebrating her pregnancy due to the actions of another person. \n\nYes, Meghan was an AH to you 10 years ago and continues to be neutral at best to your son, but Abby didn't do anything wrong to you.", "You are inherently the AH for having a child when you were a child yourself and didn\u2019t have the necessary resources to do right by and take care of the child independently let alone the emotional maturity, intelligence, patience, etc. one needs to raise a child. Even with you being a child at the time of your pregnancy, you seem like you\u2019re able to recognize it was not a good choice at the time and you had other options to prevent it. It absolutely is cruel to bring a child in the world when you are not prepared to take care of that child. I think your sisters initial response to the pregnancy is a reasonable one. If she is still distant and aloof with your son that would make her an AH today, not refusing to throw a baby shower for a child, that\u2019s not something to celebrate I agree with her completely on that one. People can rationalize and justify all they want why it\u2019s okay to have a child without securing the basic resources required to do right by them but at the end of the day the child will grow up and know what their experiences were and whether or not you were a good mother because having a child doesn\u2019t make you a good parent automatically.", "A very strong NTA\n\nOP fell preganant at 16, not ideal, however she took responsibility & played the hand she was dealt, all whilst suffering the moralistic judgement of her sister, her SISTER, one of the few people on this earth you should be able to rely on (yes I am aware sister can be awful & not always relied on, trust me I know) I cant imagine how shattered she would have been hearing her sister say\n\n>that a teen pregnancy was not something to be celebrated.  \n\n\nFast forward 10 years & Abby, the other sister who willingly went along with Megan's judgement is pregnant & thankfully to the universe this is at an acceptable age/time for Megan so a baby shower is arranged and Aunt Megan is beside herself with excitment.   \nOP rightly feels left out, ignored & upset, rather than make a scene she gets up & walks out & the ever judgemental Megan still finds a way to dig the boot into OP saying to make make a scene on Abby's day! Sheesh with a sister like Megan who needs enemies!! \n\nMegan is a massive A H & honestly Abby isnt a whole lot better - truthfully OP I cannot understand why you have anything to do with Queen Megan, you & your son are better off without someone this judgemental in your life", "NTA your sister IS cruel.", "NTA. Your sister is a massive one though. It\u2019s not unreasonable to want your family to love you and support you and it seems like over 10 years later she\u2019s still not being supportive.", "Curious question, did Megan have to help out a lot with raising you? I would almost wonder if she was resenting the fact that she got 'done' with helping to look after you, and then had another child dropped on her. (Which is why she was so blunt about not helping out) And! That if she did, maybe she was uspet/disappointed in herself, that she couldn't have helped or stopped you form getting pregnant so young.\n\nI can't judge this, but I think you and Megan need to have a really long, in depth talk. It could be that she is just a set-in-her-ways, with always be judgmental, and you need to see how to navigate that for yourself in the future.", "OP - I am appalled by all the judgmental comments on this thread. I wonder if everyone shaming you for getting pregnant at 16 remained virgins throughout high school or until they got married. If they never made a mistake or got carried away or had birth control fail, etc. Bunch of judgmental hypocrites. \n\n(FYI - 2 of my 3 kids are the result of birth control failing. But since I was older & married when it happened, I get to escape that shame I suppose.) \n\nIt sounds like you, at age 16, make the adult decision to take responsibility for your son. You were trying to do what you thought was right! I'm glad your parents supported you, but I'm sure it was hurtful that your older sister (who you probably looked up to) refused to help you in any way. Even broke college students can throw a small, inexpensive baby shower to make the mom feel supported. I'm sorry you didn't get this. \n\nHow is your relationship with Megan otherwise? If she is still cruel to you & your son, then probably healthiest thing to do is distance yourself from her. If Megan was an immature 21 year old but has since matured, then try to forgive the past. It sounds like Abby was supportive to you when your son was born, so make her the focus going forward & give her the support she needs.", "NAH - Your feelings are valid, but your reaction is not. Sorry but a child having a baby isn\u2019t really something to be celebrated. Your son is special and you of course did a great job and lucky to have your parents help to get there but this is two very different situations here.", "I understand how you feel.

The fact you are keeping and loving the child should have been celebrated.

I wish your timing had been better for expressing your pain, but NTA.", "NTA\n\nA teenage pregnancy is extremely hard for anyone involved, but imo you still deserved to be celebrated. Of course circumstances at that time made it not possible, so it's understandable why a shower didn't happen. Time has passed and circumstances have changed where Abby gets to be celebrated now, but that doesn't mean you can't feel upset about it.\n\nIf anything, when you got upset, you left quietly to not make a scene and hurt Abby on her special day. It's Megan who came and pushed it out of you, while also probably berating you on having some gosh darn human feelings.\n\nI'd agreed with the N A Hs except Megan sounds like a pretty crappy kind of sister. Since the moment you were pregnant, she saw your son as a mistake and as you said in the comments, hasn't really gone out of the way to form an actual relationship with him. She's allowed to not be on call to babysit, take care of your son, etc. But now she's celebrating your sister, *enthused* about it, so it make sense to feel hurt by her, both in the past and present.\n\nEdit: Also as other commenters have pointed out, a baby shower is not just a celebration but an event where the community can come together and gift the mother to be essential baby items. As u/sandvinomom pointed out:\n\n\"Lord knows how many showers I\u2019ve been to for unplanned pregnancies.

It's not like a DUI or something where shaming will hopefully help prevent it happening again. You were a child having a child.

You decided to keep the baby. You needed a lot of help. You needed people to babysit for you. People to watch your baby while you were in the shower. People to give you money from your college fund. Megan recognized this and set up firm boundaries from the start. She didn't want to get parentified and forced into childrearing duties that weren't her responsibility and that is absolutely okay. You do not have the right to be butthurt or to vilify her ten years later because she was not all eager to turn your choice to go through with the pregnancy and keep your baby at 16 into her having to help raise your baby. That's on you! She has zero obligation to help you in childrearing in any small way and I think the shower thing, while unkind, was most likely about trying to keep those boundaries firmly in place. You are very blase in the way you write about how oh it's no big deal to ask people to babysit for me while I need to do this, or that, or other people babysat for me, but it IS a big deal. It is her time and I think the way you write about that all these years later still doesn't respect that.\n\nI think you should recognize that you guys were all teens/very young adults when this happened ten years ago. You are all adults now. It's time to move on. You did not make perfect choices back then. Neither did she. You don't want to be judged for your mistakes, so you shouldn't be judging your sister and hanging on to things that happened ten years in the past.", "NTA.  I'm so sorry that no one supported you when you really, really needed it.  \n\nI can't believe people defending Megan.

Besides the fact that it was a teen pregnancy, I know it can be hard for others to celebrate. They should\u2019ve looked at the pregnancy as if they were getting a nephew/grandson.

No, but having a kid on your own is hard enough, why kick them when they are down?  \n\nI don't see this as a \"Flex\"  and those we have helped were grateful for shower, the gifts and occasional babysitting.", "A 16 year old needs a baby shower more than anyone.

OP\u2019s parents now had to dedicate a ton of their time to this child and OP, vs their kids.

I\u2019m not saying it was the \u201cright\u201d choice, but I can understand why at 21 that probably felt like the right choice at the time. It sucks, but not everyone gets baby showers, that\u2019s just life. OP only seems upset at Megan despite Abby & her parents also not throwing the shower, so it sounds like maybe this is more about feeling supported more broadly by Megan during what was undoubtedly a really difficult time in her life. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is wrong to feel sad about it. From what she said, it sounds like this has never come up before the context of Abby\u2019s baby shower.

There\u2019s a difference between supporting & celebrating the pregnant person (which is what a baby shower is) and supporting & celebrating a kid (which Megan also does anyways during all the expected holidays). \n\nAlso, the kid is like 10 now? So yeah, OP is sad that her sister isn\u2019t babysitting more like Abby does?There\u2019s still plenty of time for them to develop a more robust relationship as the kid grows older and has thoughts/opinions/personality separate from their parents and immediate surroundings. Ten year olds aren\u2019t really exciting to hang around unless you really love kids and some people (myself included) just aren\u2019t \u201ckid\u201d people.", "There's more in the comments.

Maybe she\u2019s resented him these last 10 years", "Yeah, my family threw a pretty big baby shower for my freshly 17-year-old pregnant cousin.

I don't know about Baby Showers now, but they were always boring parties where the mom/parents were given a bunch of practical items and advice about how to care for the new baby.

No need to continue torturing a young mom who is about to be with baby..", "It's only called a lavish party when it fits the narrative of the little boys and deadbeat daddies on this sad sub. They can be very spiteful and judgy.", "OP clearly views a baby shower as a party to celebrate her. She was able to stay at home, finish college and gain financial independence. I would say she was immensely supported, she could have thrown her own baby shower if she truly wanted. No one is celebrating teen pregnancy", "Exactly.  It\u2019s also about celebrating the new baby, who didn\u2019t ask to be conceived to an unmarried teen mom.  That child is worthwhile and special regardless of its parents\u2019 virtues.", "she said she wanted to be celebrated, so it doesn't sound like it was about the kid at all", "Who woulda thought?", "But her mom had to quit her job to watch OPs child while she was at school.", "But her sister was still living at home too.  She didn't plan on having a baby in the house at the time she was studying.

Most of the time it's agreed between the adults of a household but when it's a teen who still lives at home there are other people that feel they haven't made that choice, which at 18 is difficult to deal with.", "Which is why my judgement was NAH. Feelings are valid on both ends", "I am not suggesting at that at all.

There are absolutely ways to set boundaries without being mean.", "> I\u2019m not prepared to look after your child even for 10 minutes\n\nThat's incredibly selfish. Not all boundaries are rational.

I\u2019d hope every parent would do the same. \n\nA baby shower is, you\u2019re right, for supporting mom with necessities. In taking on full responsibility for the financial care of her pregnancy and baby, mom and dad were already doing that, yes? She didn\u2019t need people bringing her diaper trees and onesies. Mom and dad had it covered. And it is bratty to think you are entitled to a shower as you put your family through an incredibly stressful time.

Throwing Abby a baby shower might be extent of her aunty capabilities and desires. I do feel bad for OP.

Megan was not and has not ever been obligated to help her sister babysit or care for her baby. Would it have been nice? Sure, but there's also nothing wrong with her saying no to caring for a child that she did not create.

Megan didn't approve of OP's pregnancy, didn't think her having the baby was a good idea, and wasn't willing to sacrifice her future to help OP raise a child she wasn't equipped to raise on her own. OP put a big burden on her family by having that child at 16 and it's not wrong or an AH move to be less than enthusiastic about that. \n\nThis new baby *is* coming into the world under different circumstances. It's more likely Abby is in a decent financial situation and that she'll get support from the baby's father (based purely on demographics and context - I'm making an assumption here). Megan doesn't feel stressed or like she'll be forced to sacrifice to help raise this child and so feels free to celebrate it. These are natural and understandable emotions, to me (if my assumptions are true). \n\nThat doesn't make OP an AH.
