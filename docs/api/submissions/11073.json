I would have thought that Megan would have matured enough to acknowledge her mistake in the manner in which she treated you and your son.  If all the births in this world were done the right way our population would suffer a major shrink.  Every life is precious. And how amazing that you didn\u2019t internalize whatever messed up ideas Megan has.  You are a good mother and are doing your best to better yourself and raise your son.  You should feel very proud of that.  If there is shame it belongs to your sisters, for not celebrating the birth of their nephew.  Things need to be acknowledged and how can your sister Abby fully enjoy her baby shower without first acknowledging a wish that you had also experienced the same.

But I do have a few thoughts for you. \n\n1. While it is normal to feel sad about the things that you didn't have, you should at least try to be thankful for the things that you did have. \n\nLike supportive parents who paid for your pre and post pregnancy care, delivery care and your child's doctor visits during at least the first few years of his life. Supportive parents and at least one supportive sister who babysat your son. The list goes on here and you only know the exact details.\n\n\n2. When a teenage child becomes pregnant, the entire family goes  through an emotional turmoil; even if the parents decide to put on a brave face. So, while I don't condone Megan's past actions, I see where she is coming from. \n\n\n3. Maybe Megan saw what your parents were really going through and felt bad for them and hence blamed your pregnancy for all that. Again, Megan herself wasn't that old either at that time. She was just a college kid, younger than you are right now. Maybe she didn't have the emotional maturity  to handle all that. \n\n4. Maybe she was just closer to Abby than she is to you. All siblings need not be equally close.\n\nSo what I'm trying to say here is, I feel for you. But at least try to be happy for Abby right now. From what you say; she is the sister who was there for you back then,  right?", "NAH. It has been a decade. People grow, people change. She likley has more cash now to be asked to throw around, something a 21-year-old wouldn't have had. NTA for feeling like you missed out, but she is right. Circumstances are different. And I don't mean that in saying your teen pregnancy was wrong or you or you baby aren't to be celebrated, but HER circumstances, life experience, etc. are VERY different. She also isn't having to watch her parents scramble to care for her sister, which would have caused stress for the entire family and probably some resentment once she was asked to throw a party on top of that.", "YTA. I wonder how much time Megan was expected to \"watch\" OP and other sister when they were younger. I wonder how OP treated Megan during that time? I just have a feeling that maybe Megan was tired of so much of the family's energy and resources being spent on managing OP both before and after the teen pregnancy.", "NTA. You took responsibility for your actions and made it out okay even without Megan\u2019s help. Sure, it\u2019s not your sisters job to babysit. but she was evil about it. From calling your son a mistake to saying he shouldn\u2019t be celebrated with a baby shower. It\u2019s not so much a celebration as it is helping you get a head start on being a mother. Abby was helpful when you needed it and for Megan to do a 180 for her would be hurtful. Plus, you didn\u2019t make a scene when you left the baby shower, so I don\u2019t really see anything you did wrong", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA. These are two completely different circumstances and there is a difference between a child having child and adult having a child.\nPlus the whole my parents helped financially even though it came from my college fund, like I\u2019m sorry where did you expect it come from?", "YTA. You took so, so much more money and energy from your family than your sister did for one baby shower. I assume your parents paid for your care, food, home for you and baby at least until 18, yes? Are they doing that for your sister? I\u2019m guessing not. It sucks you didn\u2019t ALSO get a party, but a little bratty to whine about it.", "YTA. \n\n'She awkwardly said they were two different situations and I shouldn't make this a big deal on Abby's day'\n\nShe was right - this was the time to say ok, talk later. Not to 'get into it' and then leave Abby's shower early. That sucks for Abby.\n\nIt sucks that you didn't get a babyshower but it's not exactly unsurprising given the circumstances, sadly.\n\nA 21 year old and a 31 year old are generally two very different people. 21 year old me would have been fuming if my 16 year old sister asked me to babysit. 31 year old me would love to babysit for her.", "YTA. You had a child 10 years ago.  All of you were in a different place.  It\u2019s very different with an unplanned  teen pregnancy than a pregnancy for someone in her mid-20s.", "NAH but I would seriously reevaluate your relationship with Megan and couldn\u2019t really blame you if you decided one sister in your life is enough, in other words stop wasting your energy on that loser", "NAH.\n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are really wrong.\n\nMegan was completely entitled to stay out of your pregnancy and was essentially a child herself with no real money of her own to throw you a shower. Even your parents couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nBut I completely understand your feelings too. Part of owning your decision to have a child is also to celebrate that, and you didn\u2019t have anyone willing to do that with you. It sucks. I absolutely understand how being at a baby shower for your sister, thrown by the sister who stayed out of your pregnancy, would bring up difficult feelings. \n\nIt is a tough situation and I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge those feelings, but now that you have, I think all of you should move forward together. There\u2019s no changing the past, but it sounds like there is hope for the future.", "For feeling hurt- NTA\nfor making a scene & fighting w Megan & making Abby feel bad... YTA\n\nYou are entitled to how you feel, but this is one of those times where you remove yourself from the situation completely to calm down & address it later. And while Megan was a bit cruel during, it's understandable why she was disappointed. Personally, I wouldn't have gone as far as to say I wouldn't babysit, but honestly that was Megan's decision. Abby on the other hand was good to you & tried to help when you needed it, so there was no reason to put her in the middle especially since she is now pregnant.", "NTA\n\n\nYou know that just because she\u2019s your sister she doesn\u2019t have to be your friend right?", "YTA. There is absolutely no reason to celebrate a teen pregnancy. You created a burden for everyone living in that home. You cannot expect people to babysit for you or love your child if you make the child when you are 16. It probably changed the whole dynamic of the home.", "INFO; \n\nShe couldn\u2019t support you then, but has she since? If she has, then you need to let it go.\n\nYou were a scared 16 year old, you had your parents but you also wanted your sisters to be there for you. That\u2019s understandable. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s not about the baby shower\u2026\n\nP.S. Your parents were great helping you and your child, they helped you beat odds against you, and you sound like you\u2019re doing well. Be proud, you made it!", "NTA. \n\nand I'd like to quickly address the comments because JFC some are cruel. Yes a teen pregnancy is nothing to celebrate, but it was already happening. You were going to be a mom regardless, so to have robbed at least a bit of comfort during a scary time is cruel of them to have done. A baby shower for you wouldn't have been focused on celebration but having a official gathering with all your friends and family coming together, letting you know it's going to be alright, giving you their little parenting advices, getting you some baby necessities, and just an easy party to relax before everything gets harder would've been the bare minimum in my family. \n\nTo be a bit upset you didn't get one yet your sister got a very enthusiastic one is gonna dying regardless. \n\nPerhaps you should've gotten \"into it\" with your sister at the baby shower but your emotions are valid and normal.", "NTA. Your sister didn't have to throw you a baby shower when you got pregnant (I also understand why you wanted one and why it was and still is sad that your baby wasn't celebrated). But she should have been kinder to you -- her refusal even to watch the baby so you could rest was cruel and makes it seem like she wanted to punish you. And it would have been nice if, with time, Megan could have reflected and been kinder about what happened in the past.", "NAH. Of course you wanted support and celebration just like anyone else. It\u2019s normal to be disappointing. But the situations are totally different. And your sister is also older now and more ready to be an aunt", "NTA.\n\nActions have consequences, and Megan's decisions cast a long shadow. She owes you an apology, some sort of closure. She doesn't get to tell you to put your emotions and pain away in some closet while you pretend to be happy for Abby's sake. That's not fair to you. Your response is reasonable here.", "YTA. \n\nYou aren't the AH for being hurt that your pregnancy wasn't as celebrated as your sisters. \n\nYour sister isn't the AH for not wanting to celebrate her 16 y/o sister getting pregnant or for not treating it like a great situation.  \n\nYTA for expecting people to respond to the situations the same way and for not recognizing the difference.  And YTA for taking attention from your sister at her baby shower.", "NTA", "YTA bc you decided to have it out with Megan at an event for Abby. No, you didn't get a party, but Abby was good to you. Abby was there for you. Wouldn't you want to celebrate her having a child? No need to be friendly with Megan, but you could have had it out with her at a later date.", "YTA mostly because this wasn\u2019t the time or the place for this conversation. I think you need to understand that there is a big difference between your situation and your sister\u2019s. You were a teen mom completely financially dependent on your parents, and your sister was in college. Things are different now, everyone is financially independent, Megan probably has the time and money to help with these sorts of things, and Abby isn\u2019t depending on anyone to financially support her. Circumstances play a big role in what we get in life, having a kid at 16 typically doesn\u2019t lead to the best circumstances and you can\u2019t always get what you want.", "Nta  I would take it personally as well. Maybe not the day to bring it up but she came and asked you what was wrong", "YTA.Megan was right\u2014a teen pregnancy is nothing to celebrate about.You also had your parent\u2019s financial support which was probably a lot of money since babies are expensive.Instead of being grateful for your family\u2019s support,you wanted a baby shower too.You made it worse by telling Abby and making her feel bad.I think that being the youngest,your parents let you get away with things.Your reaction was also bratty when Megan set boundaries with you regarding baby care.", "NTA. You have the right to be upset about the way this was handled back then. The passage of time doesn't change the hurt and it was okay for you to quietly excuse yourself. Yes, there is a big difference between 21 year old Megan and 31 year old Megan but her actions are her actions and she was the one who started the confrontation.", "NTA. A shower isn\u2019t just about celebrating the pregnancy. It is about helping the new mom with items to make her transition to a new role easier. Babies require a lot of expense up front. While I get not wanting to make the experience look like a great fun time for your teenage peers, You needed that help even more than the average first time mom. It also would have helped out your parents who took on more than most grandparents have to.", "NTA.  That\u2019s going to hurt.  \n\nI feel like there\u2019s often a way to find middle ground.

But they couldn't do those things because of obvious stress, and most already supported you in different ways anyway. Teen pregnancy isn't something to be celebrated, but teen parents shouldn't be punished or insulted", "YTA. You really need to let go of your disappointment over not having a baby shower 10 years ago.

Your sister was not wrong for not wanting to celebrate a teen pregnancy or not babysitting. To each their own. \n\nYour other sister and parents didn't throw you a shower either.

I don't think you should have made a scene at Abby's baby shower since she's not the one who slighted you but your feelings are completely valid.

I am sorry that you missed out on so much excitement. Even when times are challenging, you still want milestones celebrated. Unfortunately, there are consequences to all actions and neither you or your sisters are in the same place now as you were then. Having a baby at 16 is extremely different than 28. And throwing a babyshower is something a 31 year old does, not a college student focused on school work. \n\nYour son is not a mistake, but getting pregnant was an accident. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to celebrate accidents. All you can do now is focus on the good you have.", "Nta", "YTA, I get why you're upset but you're expecting too much of a 21 year old and an 18 year old. It wasn't their job to babysit or throw you a baby shower.", "YTA", "YTA softly - the situations are different, Megan was clear she didn\u2019t support you being a teen mom and wasn\u2019t going to be supportive of it. Abby is not a teen mom, and Megan is supportive. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that view of Megan\u2019s, there\u2019s also nothing wrong with you wishing you had a baby shower, but it is also one of the potential consequences that was made clear when you choose to be a teen mom. If you had waited until adulthood, you would have gotten your shower, you live with your choices.\n\nTo a lot of people baby showers are celebrations, not everyone celebrates teenage parenthood. Teen parents often require heavy support because they\u2019re children who cannot take care of themselves yet alone another being, they take it from the government, families, and communities - it\u2019s simply just not the same celebratory time.", "NTA as you said, accidents happen and I bet you wouldn\u2019t be without your son. Your sister sounds nasty, and the other one is probably feeling caught in the middle. Hold your head high that you\u2019ve managed to get an education, whilst being a single parent and are now living in your own apartment. You should be really proud of your achievements. I\u2019m sorry some of your family didn\u2019t see it that way. F the haters OP", "Are you really going to fault your 21 year old sister for not throwing you a shower? That's the real question you need to ask. \n\nFeelings are valid and you can be upset but I wouldnt call her an AH for not being available for you when she was likely a broke college student\n\nNAH", "Asking a 21 yo to host (i.e. pay for) and take an interest in the life of their niblings isn't the same as a 31 yo. At that point in your sister's life, she didn't want anything to do with your son, she certainly didn't have the funds, and there is no requirement that she help you out.\n\nAt 31, your sister is more stable financially (presumably), more mature, and takes a greater interest in her new nibling. She isn't an AH for this. You're comparing apples and oranges. I never even held an infant until I was in my 30s. Just wasn't a fan of kids or babies. You couldn't pay me to watch children as soon as I got my license and could work a job in highschool. \n\nIt sounds like your middle sister was supportive of you and took your son into consideration when she was also just a teenager. And you basically punished her for your older sister behaving like a 21 yo. \n\nYTA. You can feel how you feel, and you're not an asshole for feeling that way, but you didn't need to involve your middle sister in it. You should have been happy for her on her day celebrating your nearly nibling. But you effectively punished your pregnant sister who was supportive of you.", "YTA. You had a teen pregnancy and were an absolute burden to your family. I completely get why a person wouldn\u2019t want to celebrate your situation. You took joy away from Abby\u2019s day. Those are completely different situations.", "YTA. It wasn't her responsibility to throw you anything. If you wanted one badly enough, throw one yourself. Or why didn't the dad's family throw you one? \n\nThere is a gigantic difference between a 16 year old getting pregnant and a grown woman being pregnant. If you can't understand that, idk what to tell you. Your sister is right that teen pregnancy shouldn't be celebrated.", "Nta.

It's been 10 years, and everyone is at different life stages now. OP is comparing apples to oranges.", "I said this in another comment but the age gap is such that it\u2019s likely Meghan was helping raise the other two siblings and resented it and being faced with the potential of a baby? Could see reacting like that, however selfishly it comes off.", "So declining to throw someone a party is a punishment now?", "The mistake was getting pregnant, not the child. All megan did was drawing boundaries and saying she won't babysit. And with how entitled OP seems to be, i'd say she was right to draw those boundaries. She is angry that her sister didn't babysat or threw her a baby shower, for god's sakes.", "No, it's not. It's called drawing boundaries. Today is a few minutes to have a shower, tomorrow is watch him all night so i can go out. You'd do the favour for a stranger because you know he won't ask you for more. By how entitled op sounds, megan was right.", "She was already getting everything provided, so the bay shower gifts would of been for her parents to save them money", "It was an accident, she didn\u2019t purposely go out and get knocked up. Families are supposed to stick together and her sister behaved like an AH", "Which would kind of indicate a shower was in order.  Where was a scare 16 year old supposed to get baby supplies?", "It\u2019s not a reason to single them out and make them feel even worse at a time when she needs her family.", "Yeah I do see the difference, but at the end of the day, there\u2019s worse things in life than having a baby. Accidents happen, OP sounds responsible. Doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s expected people to give up their lives whilst she\u2019s out partying etc.", "Getting pregnant at 16 was a mistake", "The way I read it was that Megan was worried she was going to end up having to take care of the baby. I wonder if she was made to look after her siblings when they were kids. If she was a parentified eldest child, who had just escaped to college, but still lived at home, it would be an understandable fear.", "Whilst what Megan said may of come across as harsh, what I see is her setting boundaries with OP, YOU made an adult decision so it\u2019s on you to bare the consequences, I\u2019m not going to give up my youth looking after your child, I\u2019m not prepared to look after your child even for 10 minutes, I did not sign up for this so I will not be partaking in any of the raising of the child. \nI mean don\u2019t get me wrong as I\u2019ve stated I\u2019m the product of teen mother myself and whilst I\u2019m greatful that my mother had me, I did loose on a lot of things that my peers had plus my friend had a child at 16 and her mother through her shower it was a weird experience.", "Are you joking? She made sure her sister saw and and in a way to maximize guilt? Where do you even get that? Just because someone noticed and followed her doesn't mean she caused a scene. Jesus.", "Carrying a human to term is not an accident.", "Huh there is this medical procedure that can easily correct this. They made a choice, there was no accident that is such a cop out.", "Lmao ok? \ud83d\ude02 congrats on your \u201cproper\u201d sperm I guess?", "Her college fund wasn\u2019t free money her parents still earned that money and set it aside for her education and where else did she expect the money to come from", "Her sister was 21 herself, of course she was disappointed in her getting pregnant and didn\u2019t want to babysit, now she is 31 and she sees things differently.", "I\u2019m sorry but refusing to throw her a baby shower and not wanting to baby sit is not treating her like garbage. \nExpecting everyone around her to be excited that a 16 year old was having a baby is a lot to ask. I\u2019m not saying OP made a mistake keeping her child that was her choice to make but by making that choice she needs to understand that not everyone is going to view it as some sort achievement.", "That makes more sense. I would've hoped that at some point over the last 10 years they could've figured out how to communicate with each other better since there seems like a ton of resentment from both.", "Sister actually said that whilst OP was pregnant if you read the post. Doesn\u2019t look like she asked for anything, just the older, judgemental sister telling her how it is.", "This was 10 years ago so current climate is not in question so yeah you\u2019re right pregnancy does and can happen by accident but babies don\u2019t", "From her supportive family. From money made at a job. Lots of people don't have showers. They aren't a requirement.", "She had her family. She didn't have a big party thrown. Big difference.", "It\u2019s been ten years. The situations are in no way comparable. OP wasn\u2019t singled out. \n\nIt\u2019s very different to plan a baby shower and pay for a baby shower when you\u2019re 31 with a job, then to foot the bill to celebrate you sister who is still a child having a baby. \n\nMy friend decided to marry at 19. No bachelorette party or bridal shower. Because me and the other 16 to 19 yr olds didn\u2019t have any money and we didn\u2019t have a lot of time. \n\nThe bachelorette party I held for my sister when I was 22 was pretty nice. Did my friend complain? No. Did she whine that her sister helped plan someone else\u2019s party and pay toward some of the events? No. Because she understood that everyone\u2019s circumstances were different.", "And it's a baby! The lack of shower hurts the baby.  \n\nI'm sure the newborn was happy to learn the withholding of a shower and affection made such a strong message.", "I certainly hope so", "The kid isn\u2019t and the sister was rude for saying it.", "There's a difference between telling someone, especially a teen, that they're making a bad choice... and constantly and consistently making them feel like crap about it. \n\nMegan did the latter.", "Wow -- so you lived this experience firsthand, from the child's POV. That's got to give you an acute sense of perspective.\n\nI don't have quite as hard a tough love as some folks, and I was hoping that 31-year-old Megan would employ some more empathy *just because*... but I can see the wisdom of your viewpoint. It's eye-opening. I'll keep that in mind the next time I see one of these stories.", "Not everyone has the choice to not carry to full term.", "No, but you can get pregnant on accident and not know about it until abortion is not an option.", "Not really because I do not need any more children. All of the steps I have taken to insure that I don't have anymore children are not a guarantee. Just throwing out there that some people are very easy to get pregnant or get someone else pregnant while others struggle. If your super fertile like me and my wife then even taking extreme steps can result in pregnancy.", "Yeah and they probably paid for both her sisters education, and she still worked hard to get that education. Give the girl a break \ud83d\ude44", "Tell me you hate your mom without telling me you hate your mom.\n\nThere is alot of misplaced projection in all of your posts.", "They dont have to be excited but they can at least be there for her damn\n\n\nMy mom had me at that age and yet none of my aunts and uncles treated her like the plague.\n\nHonestly no one knew until she gave birth except my gma who knew the whole time\n\nJust saying you can be disappointed in a situation and still show up for family in some type of way", "I don\u2019t think the OP has had the time, energy or wherewithal to consider how any of this impacted her siblings, she seems solely focused on how people have treated her and not at all on any nuance or consideration about circumstances, so I\u2019d be very surprised if any of that got aired out over the years.", "Just wondering if the older sister also had to already raise the sister given the age gap and that\u2019s why she reacted like that.", "Yes, that's why i said she meant getting pregnant. She literally said she asked for a baby shower. And it's obvious that she didn't like that megan (who was in college and probably had a lot to study and live her life) refused to babysit.", "You\u2019re entitled to your opinion. I just couldn\u2019t imagine treating my younger, probably terrified sister like that.", "Sister didn\u2019t come across as very supportive.", "It sounds like OP had a supportive family who took care of her financially & helped raise her baby. She didn't NEED a baby shower. She wanted one. Lots of people don't have them and do just fine.", "I have not lived as the teen mother no but I am the product t of a teen mother", "And lots do and?", "That is possible but unlikely.", "She got a break. She got to where she is (along with a lot of hard work herself) with her families help, just because her other sister wasn\u2019t willing to give up parts of her life to help her out more doesn\u2019t somehow make her a bad person", "I hear you, but where would this extra money to help with her kid AND college come from? Yeah, sucks that they used the college money saved for her for her unplanned child, but I mean.... what do you expect? Them to front the bills for this entire grandkid's life AND their kid's college? That's ridiculous.", "I don\u2019t hate my mother, at all. I\u2019m actually a lot closer to her than I was when I was younger and it wasn\u2019t just her, she and my dad stayed together and are still together but there was a huge difference between the way I was raised as compared to even my own brother who they had years after to me, they were older, they were established. And it wasn\u2019t just finacially either, I was passed about amongst family for baby sitting, I didn\u2019t have a real home until I was 6 because my parents moved between there parents homes a lot and there wasn\u2019t space for me to have many toys or anything like. I must admit I felt like my mother resented me a lot especially in my teenage years because I had what she never got and I was especially careful that I never ended up in that situation myself", "So why should her baby not have been celebrated? Because she was a teen mum? That\u2019s way out of order. Yeah she made a mistake by getting pregnant, but things happen \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you deal with it the best you can. I just don\u2019t understand why sisters wouldn\u2019t support each other.", "Treating her like what?\nNot giving up your college experience to stay home and watch her baby l?", "One person wasn't supportive. Whoopdeedoo. She had supportive parents and one supportive sister, all of whom gave up their time to watch her kid for her and helped her financially. That's more support than many teen moms.\n\nShe's mostly mad she asked for a party and didn't get one. She even mentioned how she wont get another chance for a baby shower since she wont have another kid. That's the crux of the issue. She's jealous her adult sister's planned pregnancy is being treated differently than her accidental teen pregnancy (when her sister was hardly an adult herself at the time).\n\nI get feeling jealous, but I also don't think it was 21 yr old Megan's responsibility. If no one else stepped up to throw one either then why isn't anyone else being crucified? Why didn't Mom throw it? Or an Aunt? Or one of OP's friends? It seems no one wanted to be the one awkwardly celebrating a teen pregnancy. Even Angie backed down when she realized she'd be the one in charge without Megan.\n\nI mean, it sucks. OP can feel jealous and I'd understand. But bringing it up 10 years later at her sisters baby shower isn't the time.", "OP may have been in a state or situation that wouldn't allow them to end the pregnancy. Just because you believe \"most\" people can, doesn't mean it's true for all.", "OP didn\u2019t ask the sister for anything", "Wtf is to celebrate about a child having a child?? Baby showers celebrate the mothers, not the child. And why should've Megan gave up studying or partying with her friends just because her sister got knocked up? Seriously, the entitlement of some people...", "Who asked her to give up her college experience? She wouldn't even watch the baby long enough for a stressed out 16 year old to be able to shower", "I like how you added a lot of excuses for the op. We don\u2019t know anything except that she is all oops lol accident!", "She asked her to throw her a baby shower", "Baby showers aren\u2019t just celebrations\u2026they are literally community events to provide necessities for newborn children. I think if anyone needs help gathering necessities, it\u2018a probably a teen mom. I\u2019m not a fan of teen pregnancy at all, but it does feel like withholding such community events for a teen pregnancy is more motivated towards shaming the teen mom than anything.", "You\u2019re using the argument that she\u2019s a stressed out 16 year old as some sort of reason as to why it\u2019s so bad because she\u2019s 16 but at the same time it\u2019s good she became a mother at that age and everyone should celebrate", "And? She didn\u2019t ask her to babysit", "That\u2019s a reasonable request for having a baby.", "Not a single person did that it was good to have a baby at 16.  You are totally projecting here.\n\nShowers are to help families get supplies for the baby.  And I can't think of anyone who would need more support than a scared 16 year old.", "I\u2019m not at all actually."]}
