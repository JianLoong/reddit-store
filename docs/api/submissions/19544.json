I know you didn't mean it, but you just destroyed my confidence instead of giving me the support I needed.\"", "NTA - If God exists, I doubt they are so insecure that they need to steal the credit for your good efforts. \n\nThis whole thing about praising God for anything good is even a misunderstanding of the bible. \"God helps those who help themselves\" still needs people to put in good efforts, and the people deserve praise for the efforts that they put in. Your grandmother is the asshole for misattributing your efforts to god. No matter how strong her beliefs, she should still be proud of you for your efforts and make that clear to you. She can then go thank god however she wants.\n\nIt is sad that so many Christians turn every conversations into a fight about whether or not god exists.

It\u2019s kind of disheartening to see a\u00f1l the Christianphobic people here think something as silly as this is okay to stay mad at.", "By \u201csticking to their guns\u201d, do you mean destroying the relationship with the woman who raised him all these years over an innocent comment based on something that\u2019s important to her?   I don\u2019t think grandma was trying to diminish their hard work, but rather just praising god for good fortune (whether you believe in god or not, she does). The OP and grandmother should just agree to disagree, and move on.", "Why not?", "He insulted his grandma the person that raised him that was really disrespectful he should\u2019ve controlled his stupidity", "Or they blame the devil for anything bad that happens.", "it's theologically ignorant. if you want to bash on a religion at least know the difference between grace and magic. it doesn't matter if both religions are wrong. I don't know much about Hinduism, but I'm not going to lie about what that religion believes to make them seem worse.", "you don't think she was trying to diminish the hard work when she says oh actually it was god who let you do well? really??!!", "Why is he the one being blamed for destroying the relationship if this person is so stubborn that they can\u2019t even say \u201cgood job\u201d.", "Because it's downplaying what he did, saying some magical being achieved it not him.", "So it's okay for grandma to disrespect her by saying she didn't work hard?", "If we're getting into name calling, it's really stupid to believe in the Christian God", "He is downplaying what she did, which is take him in, sacrifice for him, and keep him alive long enough to accomplish those things.  If her faith gave her the strength to do that, he ought to be praising right along with her.  He is an unappreciative, selfish ass.", "She never said she didn\u2019t work hard", "Everyone can believe in whatever they want to believe everyone here is so anti religion", "She did those things, not some magical being. He is under no obligation to praise something he doesn't believe in, and have his own hard working trivialized by them", "Yes she is. Grandma needs to give OP the credit they  deserve. Why should grandma thank God when OP did all the work?"]}
