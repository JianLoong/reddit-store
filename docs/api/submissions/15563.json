Also it's illegal", "You opened somebody\u2019s else\u2019s package, and you think it\u2019s possible you\u2019re NTA? Geezuz.", "I once broke up with someone I was dating because instead of walking his neighbor\u2019s mis-delivered package across the street, he decided it would be fine to open the package and see if it was \u201cworth keeping.\u201d I was horrified. No more dates.", "It depends if it was delivered through USPS or not. If it's delivered through USPS, it's a federal crime. If it's delivered through FedEx, UPS, Amazon, or any other delivery service, it's not a crime.\n\nAnd the law only applies if it's stolen from the mailbox or postman.

Could\u2019ve been anything in the package and it\u2019s not your shit. Wtf", "YTA. You and your friends are all AH. Amazon packages may not have the same legal protection as U.S. Mail, but the concept is still the same. You DO NOT open another person's packages unless they expressly give you permission to do so. \n\nYou are miles out of bounds. It is up to your friend whether she will forgive you.

What is wrong with you?", "YTA I literally don\u2019t open my husband\u2019s mail unless I ask and I have no reason to think he\u2019s hiding anything from me. It\u2019s common courtesy.

SHE said you had no right to open HER package and was upset about it. She deserves a sincere apology. Everyone on AITA says it wasnt appropriate to do that but our opinions are irrelevant. Maybe ONE person here gave an example of when they would be ok with this kind of thing.  But even if more people were fine with it, she wasnt.  \n\nIf you want to remain her friend, you should apologise for your mistake and not cross the line for shits and giggles.

We know phone passwords cause in case of emergency. We've told each other our pc password so many times but we can't be bothered to remember it lol.\n\nThe idea of someone at work opening something is so absurd. I used to get stuff delivered at work and was never opened once, in years. The only thing that was noteworthy was my now husband's mom sent the ring from his dad that he promised to him.
