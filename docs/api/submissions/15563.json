How do you not know that you don\u2019t open other people\u2019s packages, their mail, and bother their property. Wtf is wrong with you?", "YTA. dont open others mail", "Did it have your name on it? Were you expecting something in the package? Are you 4?   \nYTA. Don't touch other people's things unless you're a small child who doesn't know better or your name is on it.", "YTA.\n1. It\u2019s a violation of privacy.\n2. It\u2019s illegal.\n3. It\u2019s rude.\n4. It\u2019s none of your business.\n5. You\u2019re 24, you need to know better.", "YTA-My husband is the closest person in the world to me and even I don\u2019t open his Amazon packages or any other mail because it\u2019s his and he has the right to privacy. It\u2019s not about him hiding things from me and it\u2019s not about your friend hiding things from you. It\u2019s about not violating their privacy.", "YTA - This is a simple life lesson you should have learned as a child.", "YTA,it's none of your business", "YTA bigtime. And also you need to eliminate the word \u201csimply\u201d from your vocabulary because you are using it wrong and sound absolutely ridiculous.", "YTA \n\nwhere I work it is part of my job to open the mail and out a requirement that I screen everything. That being said, if an Amazon package comes in that\u2019s clearly for an individual and not business related at all, I DO NOT OPEN IT. I go hand it to the person that its addressed to!!  \n\nIf the tables were turned and they opened your mail without you being in the same room, you would feel very violated", "Even my 7 year old doesn\u2019t open Mail that has someone else\u2019s name on it. Even if she knows it\u2019s for her, she still waits for someone else to open it for her.\n\nOp, YTA", "YTA. Big time, OP. Came here to say this.", "It is where I live, and I believe in the entire EU. Not just mail though, emails and texts as well", "Fr and honestly, if they were so curious they could\u2019ve just waited and asked :/ like that\u2019s a pretty acceptable way to be a little nosy that isn\u2019t violating someone\u2019s privacy", "Yup. Also, \"nothing to hide\" is for her to decide, not OP.\n\nYTA", "Amazon isn't \"post\" unless it comes in the mail.", "Same here. My partner and I have lived together for over 6 years and we don't open mail or packages that are addressed to the other person. It's just common courtesy!", "I'm married and I dont open my husband packages without consent. Because you know, I respect his privacy and autonomy. Also is delightful.to.open something you were waiting and I adore his laugh and excitement.\nBig YTA!", "This.", "It is illegal to open any package that isn't yours, but it isn't a federal offense unless it was delivered by the USPS, so this likely wouldn't apply.", "It sure is. Can you imagine though, just casually opening something that isn't even addressed to you.", "Happy cake day!", "Exactly! Came in here to point out that the OP is not just merely a YTA, but a criminal. Congrats!", "Indeed. I don't know rules around the whole world but this definitely is the case adverts many countries.", "Well in Ireland it comes in the post so it is a crime to open it. Though there\u2019s probably specific regulations about opening any packages that aren\u2019t addressed to you.", "Amazon is mail. Mail is defined as \"letters and packages that come in the postal system.\" Postal system is defined as  \"an institution that makes it possible for any person to send a letter, packet, or parcel to any addressee, in the same country or abroad.\"\n\nI'm in Canada, sometimes our Amazon is delivered by a 3rd party because they don't have drivers everywhere. So yes, it's mailed, thus it's post. \n\nEdit to add: YTA, OP. It's illegal.", "In the U.S. it is a federal offense to open anyone else's mail regardless of what method of shipping was used (FedEx, USPS, UPS, DHL, etc)", "From Ireland too and yep it\u2019s an offence to open anything intentionally that isn\u2019t addressed to you"]}
