That's at least $1,600 per month you've been giving her (again I'm ignoring taxes here). I suppose one might want a bit more data to get at a full understanding of the economics of the household: how much is the rent, and how is it paid? For many cities, $1,600 a month wouldn't even cover a 2-bedroom anywhere, so are your mother and sister also working, and contributing to rent? Does your sister also give your mother half her pay? What does your mother use it for? \n\nBut even aside from all these details, no, NTA remotely for not wanting to live with your mother and give her half your pay. \n\nGod will never support your mother; nor you; nor lift a leaf or move a single mote of dust. God is an excuse your mother is using to guilt and control you. Likewise, while you may owe your mother to some extent, you don't owe her for the mere fact of raising you - that's literally what parents are supposed to do. You don't have to let it be this way. Most people, in most societies at least, I think have far more autonomy than you've described for yourself, one way or another.", "NTA.  She is abusing you.  Stop the money strain straight away.

So if it's a three bedroom apartment and half of your Paycheck is an equal 1/3 of the rent & utilities,  than i'd say kind of tough luck unfortunately.

Your mother is not more \"special\" to God than you are, and God gives a dire warning to those who use him as an excuse to sin or oppress others. Dunno what God y'all worship, but the Bible says that while yes, we children should respect our parents, it's not a one way road. Parents have to be good parents to their kids, and it says do not do anything to anger your children. \n\nMy family was like this growing up. Using my Father and lack of knowledge to condemn or manipulate me. If you really wanna know how God feels about you then ask *him*. Yo momma ain't God, and you need to remember that more than she does. God may speak to us, but we'd be far too arrogant to believe we always speak for him. \n\nDon't fall for those tricks.

You must be living in central london if your wage is needed to keep your mum and sister housed and fed!\n\nYou are in no way responsible for paying the family bills. Everyone is working.
