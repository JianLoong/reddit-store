I would say it's not easy to learn a new medical diet so when people make mistakes I usually try to take an educating approach rather than a judgmental approach. In this case, your mom was cooking the alternative rice, so I'm not sure I would put the sugar addition down to malice. Of course I don't know your situation, maybe your mom was indeed trying to kill your wife but in my experience, that's unlikely. More often, people just find it really difficult to change their cooking habits. We don't realize how automatic our cooking and eating is, until we have to change it, and then our old ways keep sneaking back in. My food allergy kid used to be allergic to dairy and I was an expert at managing that and would roll my eyes at all the ways people didn't realize dairy was sneaking into their food. Then he outgrew his dairy allergy and within a couple of years I had totally forgotten how to make dairy-free food. Now he's allergic to nuts and I roll my eyes at the ways people don't realize nuts are sneaking into their food.\n\nThe other thing I would say is that most people have a really hard time cooking without sugar. I know this because I too cook without sugar, although not for diabetes. The only person I trust to cook for me other than myself, is my husband. Even my mom, once I moved out of her house, forgot how to cook for my dietary restrictions. Practically everything has added sugar and most people, if there isn't sugar in food, feel that it's tasteless somehow and keep trying to find ways to add it back: white sugar, brown sugar, honey, agave syrup, truvia, monk fruit extract. Think of all the different sugar substitutes that try to give people ways to make food taste sweet without putting in \"sugar\" to their food. \n\nIn terms of teaching someone how to cook for a new diet, I think that if the stakes are high as in the case of your wife, then the cooking of all meals really needs to be directly supervised by the person with the medical condition (or their guardian, if it's a child) until the trainee is completely competent at cooking for the diet in the correct way. That way you can catch errors and misconceptions before the person with the restricted diet ingests the food.\n\nI would also say the other thing is that it is indeed difficult to cook a separate meal just for one person. It's another pot to prepare and wash, another burner on the stove, another timed dish to keep track of to make sure you don't burn it or forget about it. Most of the people I know who have a diet restriction, cook one meal for the whole family each day. You may set aside particular leftovers for the person with the restriction for the next day. But cooking, for example, gluten pasta and gluten-free pasta for every hot meal, day after day, is a lot of extra work for the cook and it gets tiring. it's probably the same with alternative rice.", "YTA Jesus so your mother is actively sabatoging your wife\u2019s health while she\u2019s pregnant (sorry there\u2019s 0 reason to ADD sugar to someone suffering from diabetes) and you\u2019re not only excusing that but actively insulting and calling your wife names?

No.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be fair, I am speaking from experience with chronic diabetes (type 1, the insulin dependent kind), so some of what I have to say may not be applicable, but sneaking extra sugar into MY food could easily kill me, and I doubt that's too dissimilar to what can happen to your wife.  Depending on how much sugar is added (read: how much glucose it'll break down into), the amount and intensity needed to exercise it off may be too much for her ability as a pregnant woman.  Not to mention that if her blood glucose is high enough (don't know how easy/hard it is for someone with this type of diabetes to reach, but for me personally I wouldn't risk it at or above 300 mg/dL) it becomes dangerous and possibly deadly to exercise because it can make the appearance of a type of blood poisoning from ketones called ketoacidosis come quicker due to the acids being moved quicker through the bloodstream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLesson here is: YTA and don't fuck with diabetes.  Apologize to your wife and yell at your mom.", "Do you know what happens if the numbers are higher? She goes on insulin. Also as hormones go up and pregnancy gets further along, it's going to be harder to exercise down those numbers. She'll start getting sick and that excess sugar is all going straight to baby.

As many people already pointed out on the potential complications I'm surprised you don't care you wife and you baby as much as you should have.", "You sound delusional about how serious a situation your wife is dealing with and trying to manage.
