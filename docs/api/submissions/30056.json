I would say it's not easy to learn a new medical diet so when people make mistakes I usually try to take an educating approach rather than a judgmental approach. In this case, your mom was cooking the alternative rice, so I'm not sure I would put the sugar addition down to malice. Of course I don't know your situation, maybe your mom was indeed trying to kill your wife but in my experience, that's unlikely. More often, people just find it really difficult to change their cooking habits. We don't realize how automatic our cooking and eating is, until we have to change it, and then our old ways keep sneaking back in. My food allergy kid used to be allergic to dairy and I was an expert at managing that and would roll my eyes at all the ways people didn't realize dairy was sneaking into their food. Then he outgrew his dairy allergy and within a couple of years I had totally forgotten how to make dairy-free food. Now he's allergic to nuts and I roll my eyes at the ways people don't realize nuts are sneaking into their food.\n\nThe other thing I would say is that most people have a really hard time cooking without sugar. I know this because I too cook without sugar, although not for diabetes. The only person I trust to cook for me other than myself, is my husband. Even my mom, once I moved out of her house, forgot how to cook for my dietary restrictions. Practically everything has added sugar and most people, if there isn't sugar in food, feel that it's tasteless somehow and keep trying to find ways to add it back: white sugar, brown sugar, honey, agave syrup, truvia, monk fruit extract. Think of all the different sugar substitutes that try to give people ways to make food taste sweet without putting in \"sugar\" to their food. \n\nIn terms of teaching someone how to cook for a new diet, I think that if the stakes are high as in the case of your wife, then the cooking of all meals really needs to be directly supervised by the person with the medical condition (or their guardian, if it's a child) until the trainee is completely competent at cooking for the diet in the correct way. That way you can catch errors and misconceptions before the person with the restricted diet ingests the food.\n\nI would also say the other thing is that it is indeed difficult to cook a separate meal just for one person. It's another pot to prepare and wash, another burner on the stove, another timed dish to keep track of to make sure you don't burn it or forget about it. Most of the people I know who have a diet restriction, cook one meal for the whole family each day. You may set aside particular leftovers for the person with the restriction for the next day. But cooking, for example, gluten pasta and gluten-free pasta for every hot meal, day after day, is a lot of extra work for the cook and it gets tiring. it's probably the same with alternative rice.", "YTA Jesus so your mother is actively sabatoging your wife\u2019s health while she\u2019s pregnant (sorry there\u2019s 0 reason to ADD sugar to someone suffering from diabetes) and you\u2019re not only excusing that but actively insulting and calling your wife names?

Oopsie!* \n\nIn which case, you send your wife home and you can stay with Mommy for a bit. Maybe your wife can get the divorce paperwork started while you\u2019re away. \n\nEither way, your wife needs to get away from your mom ASAP. Oh, and YTA. Grow a spine, stand up to your mother, and most importantly, protect your wife. It\u2019s weird that you need that explained to you.", "You might want to make sure your mommy doesn't have any rat poison under the sink because she might decide to use it if sugar doesn't kill your wife and child.", "Omg dude. YTA, your mother is putting the life/health of your unborn baby at risk. Do you know what happens to babies when the mother has uncontrolled gestational diabetes? The best outcome is that they are born with hypoglycemia and are way too large. Think a 10lb baby. You are being a terrible husband and honestly not a good father either. \n\nAlso of course the remarks about how much easier it is to cook only one type of rice was a snide remark to your wife. Use your brain man, apologize to your wife and ffs do better with helping her out with her condition.", "She KNOWNINGLY put sugar in a diebetic's food? \n\nAnd you're not on 100% on your wife's side? \n\nWow.", "are you going to be this blase when your mother feeds your child something they're allergic to and kills them?", "Yup completely agree, my MIL is Chinese and she could absolutely do this as well. She's not a malicious person, but there's just this sense of arrogance in the culture that makes it such that anyone older than you MUST be right, no matter what their opinion is. So it's ignorance coupled with a \"I've never heard of it so it must nor be that serious\" attitude, and it's really annoying and frustrating, but it's not malicious.", "Why does his mom have to \"sneak\" the sugar?", "I mean, he's just saying those things to his wife because she pointed out that his mommy was trying to kill her and the baby. OP's wife is a big meanie not letting herself and child be murdered by his mommy. \n\n/s or maybe not", "How does MIL not know this, and why doesn't she care? OP's wife is pregnant, diabetes is not something to mess with. Wth. \n\nWhen I was pregnant, I was super healthy (though still had gallstones so I couldn't have anything greasy) and still my SIL would always ask what I could eat and what not before cooking for us when we went to see her. I would have totally done the same thing (for my SIL), because you care about the person (and the child).", "My father in law had diabetes.  One day he remarked how much he liked Coffee Coolattas from Dunkin Donuts.  He had no idea, until I told him that they were literally filled with sugar.  They taste like coffee milkshakes because they are essentially coffee milkshakes.   People who should know better many times don't.", "I caught that as well. Like, OP, if one of the main reasons you think your mother isn't doing this on purpose is just that it could hurt the baby, maybe their relationship is bad enough that your wife isn't automatically crazy for thinking her MIL is being intentionally harmful.", "Well, if mom didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong then she wouldn\u2019t have been sneaking around doing it.", "I would not expect someone to add sugar to rice\u2026 and even porridge, I\u2019d expect it to be visibly on top if in it not mixed in", "She rectified it when *her son* told her to. I wonder how many times OP's wife asked and was ignored.", "I'm from Latin America too and what's most important is that the mom is save and eats what she can eat, not what MIL thinks she should eat.", ">After being educated, she obliged.\n\nShe literally did not.\n\nShe went out of her way to sneak sugar into the diet of someone with GD and make snide comments towards said woman.\n\nIf she had any good intentions she would've bought the rice OP's wife can eat without any fuss.\n\nIf they were any good they might even join in on eating the same rice and could've solved the issue of the \"extra work\" while making the pregnant person that can't eat something else feel involved in the family dynamic.", "Youll regret when your actions cause further complications with her pregnancy. You\u2019ve already caused significant stress", "Okay- then why are you deliberately not choosing her as your first and most important? Your complete disregard for her safety because mama needs to sabotage, it\u2019s a very YTA moment. And yes- your wife is considering her true position in your for. We all know she comes after your mother.", "No, but many people do not understand diabetes and gestational diabetes is a whole nother ball game.\n\nBut when dealing with people from another country where there could easy be a miscommunication, I'd be shopping for myself and cooking for myself for two reasons.\n\nOne would be so that I need what I was eating was the proper foods, in the proper amounts.\n\nSecond I would not want to be a burden to an older family member.", "Unfortunately not so uncommon in Asia", "Same. The wife needs to get out of there.  OP doesn't have her back and probably never will.", "SO your mother came over to enforce a tradition on your wife that she doesn't follow? Then refused to listen to your wife when she said your mother was doing something wrong? And your mother got upset that your wife got angry at not being listened to about the way SHE wants to care for HER newborn? So when your wife ACTUALLY needed help for an hour to get some sleep, your mother was petty and refused despite being there to \"help\"???\n\nDoesn't sound helpful to me. It sounds like mommy dearest wants to be allowed to do whatever she wants with a baby that's not hers and is crying when she's not allowed to. I'd actually be willing to bet that your mother was doing something unsafe with the baby. Research about infant safety has come a long way since your mother had babies and you're not supposed to do things with babies that people used to do because it's unsafe. No one reasonable would get THAT mad over something unless it was dangerous....", "Bro... You don't see how your mom is being real petty here? Really? I understand that maybe to her and you that's okay, but to a lot of the rest of the world that was incredibly rude behavior. If I were your wife, your mom wouldn't be allowed anywhere near me or my kids. That was cruel.", "Your mother sounds horribly unbearable. Your wife didn\u2019t like how your mother looked after your baby, was tired the next day because she had JUST given birth (assuming this happened within the month as per your comment) and needed to sleep and your mother was passive aggressive in her reply. Where are you as a father PARENTING your child? That\u2019s the moment, when your wife needs to sleep, you step in as dad and take care of your child! And also, maybe SAY SOMETHING to your mother?! She\u2019s being disrespectful to your wife and you are letting her get away with it. You are the problem. Stand up for your wife. \n\nAs to your initial question, gestational diabetes is not something to be trifled with. Your mother deliberately sabotaged your wife\u2019s diet. If your father has diabetes she knows what the diet should be. Your wife outlined what the diet should be and she has deliberately gone against the diet. YTA. I feel incredibly sad for you wife.", "Why do you think your wife is small minded for not wanting to harmed by your mother adding sugar to her meals?", "Most people know that sugar is generally not added to a diabetic diet.", "Your wife is right! \"Of course my wife thinks otherwise,\" you dismiss her at every turn. She KNOWS what she needs and doesn't need/can't have. She got diagnosed by a DOCTOR. Quit being a mama's boy, cut the cord and take care of your wife and unborn child.", "Be honest with yourself, your mom straight up doesn\u2019t care how bad gestational diabetes is. Dude you have got to step in and protect your wife and child. Your mom is being terrible, I can\u2019t stress this enough but her behavior puts your unborn baby at risk. Not just your wife, so if you can\u2019t get it together to be a good husband here please at least protect your baby.", "Well you can thank your mom when your wife can\u2019t have a natural birth and the kid has sugar issues when it is born and has to go to NICU. Gestational diabetes being uncontrolled causes larger babies. Hope it will be worth it. You gonna stay home while she heals from that surgery? Because that takes longer. If you know your mom was adding sugar, why didn\u2019t you shut that down? Do you want a stillborn baby and dead wife because bigger babies and bigger true or look", "If your mother knows about diabetes from experience, then yes, she knew exactly what she was doing when she \"added some sugars\" to your wife's food. Your wife was right to be angry and it's bizarre that you weren't angry about this too.", "Gestational diabetes is not the same as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, so it doesn't matter if your father is diabetic. The probably just makes you all complacent.\n\nIt's caused by hormones and gets progressively worse throughout the pregnancy.\n\nHigh blood sugars can also lead to a bigger baby, potentially creating lots of risks during childbirth.\n\nThey can also lead to the placenta degrading prematurely leading to premature birth or your child not getting enough nutrition or oxygen.\n\nIf uncontrolled, it increases the risk of still birth. Even if your mother wasn't malicious, your wife is entitled to be concerned and upset when your mother's actions could increase the risk of the death of your child. You and your mother are not taking this seriously enough.\n\nSome pregnant women are unable to tolerate any whote rice or alternative rice at all.\n\nMy son ended up in neonatal intensive care as a result of my late gestational diabetes diagnosis, so I know what I'm talking about.\n\nYTA", "YTA, your poor pregnant wife deserves so much better than this.", "If it\u2019s added for taste, why was she ***sneaking it***?", "Ah, okay, this sheds light on OP's mom's attitude. She is accustomed to a diabetic husband who cheats on his diet and is apparently in acceptable enough health. That is probably why she initially wasn't strict about added sugar and white rice around OP's wife. \n\nSeems like there is some culture clash and health awareness differences happening with wife and MIL.", "Why was ur mom sneaking sugar in the food if she didn\u2019t know she was doing something wrong or if she wasn\u2019t being malicious.", "Because your wife is there seeing the context clues and you are not.", "\u201cMy mother was just making food for my wife that was literally dangerous to her in her condition! I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s so mad!\u201d\n\nYTA !", "He took her overseas to visit family. She\u2019s literally trapped with someone trying to harm her.", "And don't act surprised if she gets herself out and leaves you behind.", "Yep, exactly. Well put", "Yep - I'm Indian and when my wife and I first visited India, my wife had the runs (of course she did even with precautions).  She wanted plain white rice (she wanted saltines but we didn't have any).  My mom still put ghee and salt into it and served it with lentils on the side.  She simply couldn't phathom eating plain rice and serving it as such would be an insult.  The next time when we said no ghee, no sides, she put yoghurt in it.  Like....  MOOOOOOM!", "I wouldn't last 10 minutes with in-laws like that.", "This is what I came to say. While she may be aware, she may also be relying on self understanding of diabetes and not really educated on it. My mom could never figure out why fruit pies aren\u2019t good for me to eat (it\u2019s fruit! She would say) and thought any whole food prepared from scratch was \u201chealthy\u201d.\n\nEdit: YTA for how you handled it, belittling her when this was a good chance to talk to your mother about what her actual dietary requirements are. You mom may or may not be an AH, not that you asked but that\u2019s what I meant to say in my original post.", "What did he think made them sweet?", "That's a little different than adding straight sugar to food lol. Also I assume he stopped drinking them after he found out he shouldn't be. Just as MIL new the wife was only supposed to be having a specific type of rice.", "Holy shiiiiiiit just a small one of those has more than 60g of sugar in it what the fuck!", "Smh true though", "Agreed. Like they're using them as incubators for their child and their mom to have a grand kid. It's frankly pretty messed up.", "If they're Asian I think the MIL would consider that extremely rude to come in and start cooking in her kitchen.", "And different cultures!!! There are some allowed actions in other cultures that in other places would have a child removed from the home!!!", "I mean if you have a problem with the way I\u2019m doing something don\u2019t turn around and ask me to do it the next day\u2026.", "I'm a T1D and I had to adhere to a very strict diet during pregnancy. I had to keep my a1c as close to 5.5 as I could. All the risks you pointed out for a baby to a GD mom are the same for any diabetic mom. My son was born at 8 Mos at 7.5 lbs and I worked extremely hard to make it sure.\n\nHormones also affect type one diabetic blood sugar. As in cortisol will still raise it, glycogen will also raise it.\n\nI don't know why you think it's so different for type 1s, or not a risk, or something but it's actually more dangerous and difficult to keep a pregnancy.", "we're all going to end up dead", "OP\u2019s comments and past comments just shows how much of an AH he is. I\u2019m SE asian and Chinese as well but his is the very stereotypical Chinese son syndrome where he won\u2019t go against mummy because she gave birth to him and have to \u201crespect the elders\u201d and not go against them even when they are wrong.\n\nThere is literally no point in telling him how much of an AH he is when he is just trying to justify all of his actions at this point.", ">think\n\nFound the issue.

She's making passive aggressive digs about having to cook a seperate kind of rice for \"some people\" if she expected OPs wife to be doing all the cooking there's no way she wouldn't have been vocal about it.
