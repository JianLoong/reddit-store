She can make her own decisions in life. YTA.", "I'd say YTA. I'm sure you're concerned about your friend but I really don't know what other reaction you expected from her.  Was she supposed to book an abortion?  Put it up for adoption? Your other friends are right on this one.  She's already pregnant so all you can really do at this point is be supportive.", "YTA\n\nwhat was your next step? talk her into having an abortion?\n\nshes 33 not 18", "YTA. And because you even suggested abortion to her, as I read in the comment. You crossed the line.", "YTA - it\u2019s their relationship and not one you should be getting involved in. I\u2019m friends with a couple that fell pregnant after 3 months and 14 years later, they\u2019re still together and happy. Your friend is in her 30\u2019s so perfectly capable of deciding what\u2019s best for her. Just be a friend and be happy for her if she\u2019s happy.", "Decisions we trust you can responsibly handle at 33:\n\n1. *Drinking*: if you want.\n2. *Get into a relationship*: Love who you want.\n3. *Have sex*: It's your body.\n4. *Get Pregnant*: **WHO THE F\\*\\*\\* DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?**\n\nEdit: She's been managing every other aspect of her life? Well she must not know what she's doing now.\n\nYTA", "Your friend is in love and thrilled that she is going to have a baby.\n\n>I expressed my concern about how stupid this was and how they should have been more careful.\n\nWow, YTA for sure. Way to rain on her parade.", "YTA - mind your own business", "Eh.  Your friend is an adult.  She's told you about the pregnancy, so presumably she's happy about it and intends to carry it through, so what is the point in expressing your concerns?  Frankly, that's the sort of thing you mutter about over cocktails with other, non-pregnant friends, not the thing you say to someone who's going to have a baby.\n\nYTA", "YTA as you already stated, it happened already and they are happy. Of course it's insane to have a Baby after 6 months of relationship/ knowing each other, but the only right Thing to Do is offer your help, if she needs it and stay in touch in case she gets in trouble (turning out him babytrapping her, abusive boyfriend, you know what i mean)\nApologise to her and Tell her you voiced your concerns the wrong way. Then offer her to be there for her, if something comes up.", "YTA\n\n How is any of that your bussiness? Unless she asks you to raise the kid for her, you have 0 rights to butt in.", "YTA. I get the concern but considering it's something that happened and can't be changed you shouldn't have said anything. It's her life. You said they're in love. Just let them be.", "YTA my friends parents got engaged and married after knowing each other a month, they are still happily married. This relationship isn\u2019t your business and at this point your opinion can\u2019t be helpful", "YTA. It\u2019s not your place to offer a grown woman to get an abortion. Also, the comment \u201cyou should have been more careful\u201d is not useful and just projects negativity.", "YTA- it's not for you to judge her life or shame her choices. She's an adult. Telling her it was stupid she should have been more careful doesn't help anyone.", " I\u2019d say YTA, but only because of *how* you expressed your concern. There\u2019s no need for name-calling or blame at this time. I get being concerned, but she\u2019s in her 30\u2019s, and has probably considered them not working out and just co-parenting. Maybe she\u2019s just ready for a kid. My cousin found a man she thought would make a good dad, but didn\u2019t necessarily want to be with. They agreed to co-parent from the start. Their son is 22 now so it worked out for them. \nBut the best way to show your concern is to be supportive. She\u2019ll be much more likely to rely on you when she needs it.", "YTA. If your friend is happy, be happy for her.", "YTA, you are acting out of surprise and concern, but berating her for something that's already happened is not helpful at all. \n\nFor now, she's going to be looking for support. You don't know that this relationship she has won't work. Hopefully it will.\n\nBTW plenty of people know very well they've met the person for them within 6 months. My parents for example; they married 6 weeks after meeting each other, and are still happily married over 50 years later.", "YTA not because you think it's a huge mistake and a dumb decision because it is. But YTA because it wasn't the time or method to express how you feel. It's her life. If she's happy just say congratulations and keep it moving. You don't have to agree with what someone is doing to be happy for them if they are happy.", "YTA.  The \"damage is done\" so why say anything?  She seems happy so let her be happy.  You sound a bit miserable.", "YTA, for suggesting abortion on a pregnancy your friend happily told you about. She\u2019s old enough and has a good job, if he fucks off she will be fine. Maybe she wants a baby regardless of if she stays with him.", "If you actually said it like that, yeah, YTA. Uncalled for. Concern can be expressed by offering support, not calling someone stupid and telling them to be careful when it\u2019s already too late.", "YTA I feel bad for you though, clearly your life is so boring and empty that you need to butt into something that has nothing to do with you \n\nGet a hobby, knitting perhaps?", "YTA - Sadly stuff happens and you just rubbed it in their face.", "YTA. I\u2019m sure you mean well, but it\u2019s none of your business.", "YTA- You should have kept your opinion to yourself, but instead offered help IF things do go pear shaped like you fear.", "YTA\n\nI understand your concern but if you think this is a mistake then you need to let her make it \n\nThe more objective you are the more she\u2019ll dig her heels in and you\u2019ll be made out to be the bad person\n\nSometimes people need to learn these lesson themselves", "Yes, YTA.\n\nNo-one tells you they're pregnant to be called stupid and told they should've been more careful.", "YTA. You\u2019re not wrong but you are an AH. Telling her she was dumb and should have been more careful doesn\u2019t actually achieve anything except to make her feel like crap about something she\u2019s really excited about. I assume you\u2019re worried about the possibility of a spilt or him turning out to be a bad dude? Telling her she\u2019s stupid is just going to push her away from you. If you\u2019re actually worried about that then just be there for her if the poop does hit the fan. She\u2019s going to need a lot of support as a new mother, doesn\u2019t need your judgement.", "She\u2019s right, you\u2019re rude. And YTA. If she seems happy, you should be happy for her. Besides, how do you know this was unplanned? Maybe she wanted to get pregnant.", "YTA. Did you think telling her she was stupid would change what is already in motion? Of course not.\n\nAs friends, all we can do in this life is support each other and cheer on our loved ones. Life is way to short to be around those who tear us down; that would be you, OP, in this scenario. \n\nToo bad you have one less friend now.", "YTA.  What's the point of raining on her parade?  She made a potentially bad decision to allow a pregnancy.  It's admirable that you are concerned about her future, but it's done.", "YTA while you may be right, ask yourself what good do you comments do now that she's already pregnant.", "I know someone that got pregnant by a stranger on purpose even. Cheaper donor basically.\nBut i never judged her for it, her decision?\nAnd same with those two, their life, their choices. And maybe there is more to it than you even know \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f and even if it was just an accident, that baby can still have a happy life and loving parents.\n\nThe only negativity comes from OP here.", "YTA - baby is here now and short of an abortion, it is not going away. A fair few relationships start this way with babies, accidential or not. They may do well, they may do badly but that is to be seen. She and he are at least at the age of mature adults and hopefully with established jobs so all that going for them.", "YTA. She isn\u2019t in high school or college. She\u2019s adult enough where she can probably handle this. Should they have been more careful? Probably. But it\u2019s moot and unhelpful. She\u2019s already pregnant. Maybe this relationship will work out, maybe it won\u2019t. Regardless, it isn\u2019t your place to lecture her about something that\u2019s already happened, and something she\u2019s actually excited about.", "YTA , \n\n6 months is plenty of time to get to know someone if you've already spent alot of time together. I'm 34 I met my partner 3 years ago and we've been dating for a year and a half - we have been trying to have a baby for the last few because we are confident in our relationship and we both want children. Fertility in your 30s is now joke and whilst it may be easy for some the harsh reality is it's not that easy to get pregnant at any age. I find that most people in their 30s also find a new confidence to just go for the things that they want and for your friend that may have been to settle down and have a baby. Don't be judgemental at how she's choosing to live her life she's an adult that's going to become a mother and if she's a good person and can provide a loving and safe home that's all that matters . Also single parents and Co parenting exists, is it hard ? Absolutely but it can also be worth it to a person who really wants to be a parent. \n\nYour friend is old enough to know that sex can lead to pregnancy and I don't get why so many people act like it's such an accident to get pregnant and also it's none your business. \n\nPlus you are YTA for suggesting she get rid of it or helping to get rid of her baby . Abortion is a valid option for some but it should never be suggested be a friend especially if the other person is happy to be pregnant.", "YTa", "YTA/INFO\n\nPerhaps more information is needed. \n\nCompetent adults can start a family. \n\nIs there a reason you think they won't be competent parents?", "YTA and at this rate you won\u2019t have to worry about calling her a friend either", "YTA. I read in the comments that you said you\u2019d support her if she wants to \u2018sort it out\u2019. I.e, abortion. This sounds conditional. Does that mean you won\u2019t support her if she decides to keep the baby? Conditional friends aren\u2019t really friends.", "YTA\n\nWhat's happened has already happened. She can't change the fact that she is currently pregnant. \n\nWhy not focus on the things she can control instead of criticising her on something she can't control?", "YTA\n\nShe's happy to be pregnant, is in love and you tell her she's stupid and suggest abortion?.\n\nWTF is wrong with you?\n\nYou sound jealous and scared you'll be left behind and made irrelevant when the baby comes. With friends like you, who needs enemies? If you want to save your friendship, you'd better apologize profusely and offer any support she needs", "YTA she's 33 years old and she's pregnant it's not like she's some 19-year-old who made a mistake. Maybe she's one of the first of your friends to have a kid and you're still in that mentality where when someone tells you you're pregnant you're like oh my God how are you going to fix this \n\nYou all are well past that age right now. On top of that who the hell needs your negativity in that situation. At the very least you could have said how do you feel and then go off of what she said. There's no need for you to suggest an abortion. You are a major AH. You've definitely damaged that relationship. She's not going to feel comfortable talking to you about her pregnancy and you're probably not going to be around her kid much.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t ask you what to do about her pregnancy, she told you she was pregnant and happy about it. That was a time to be supportive of your friend\u2019s decision, not critical.", "There's a lot of way to expressed your concern, and you picked up the worst one...\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your friend is 33 years old. Suggesting abortion for a clearly wanted pregnancy is very rude. You can be concerned, but you crossed a line when you said what you said.", "YTA. It\u2019s literally none of your business.", "YTA. You realise at 33 your friend might have been thinking babies might not happen for her?\n\n If you can't go to her and apologize for your reaction and be supportive from now on then you are not a good friend. No matter what happens going forward she's going to need a good support network. Pregnancy is hard, parenting is hard. If the relationship doesn't work out that is going to be extra hard but I know people who have been together for nearly a decade that have split without any external signs of unhappiness and I know people who got pregnant by accident within a year of starting to see someone who are still happily together raising their child. You can predict the future of a relationship based on how long it's lasted so far.", "YTA. As someone who went through this situation with a friend a few years ago, you offer your support and keep your opinion to yourself. She knows exactly what she\u2019s done, she doesn\u2019t need unsolicited opinions.", "I\u2019m confused \u2026 because you seem to think for some reason that this is any of your business .. it is not. \nShe made her choice and is happy about it .. you\u2019re supposed to be her friend .. why was it more important to you to express your negative opinions about it rather than simply say congratulations and keep your opinion to yourself ? \nYTA and a crappy friend too", "NAH, since you're coming from a well meaning place, but you should have been much more tactful with how you phrased it", "NTA.

You assume she wasn't careful but birth control (even tubal ligation and vasectomy) fails.  YTA for making rude assumptions.  It sounds like it wasn't planned but that doesn't mean it's unwanted.

You can't just swoop in and give her unsolicited advice. You're just heckling her life.", "YTA for how you approached it. You could have said hey I am concerned for you in this situation but you went for basically calling her stupid. I wouldn\u2019t talk to you if you were my \u201cfriend\u201d either. Friends express concern they don\u2019t pass judgment. It is a totally workable situation. My partner and I wanted kids we were pregnant after dating 3 months and we are unbelievably happy with our son and are planning on having a second. For some people it just works. If you want to fix your relationship let her know you are sorry for coming off as judgmental and sorry for basically calling her stupid.

It was a supportive and productive conversation!", "Where did OP say she told her friend to abort? Almost everyone seems to be on that bandwagon.\n\nFrankly birth rates are down because most people are looking at this world and realising, it\u2019s not that great a place right now to have children in. \n\nBut I did say NAH.\n\nIf you can\u2019t be open, and honest, among your friends then you need new friends.\n\n\nThen again I could say that everyone else are TA because the OP could very well be on the spectrum, ASD people often just blurt out what they\u2019re thinking, you know how some people just seem to have no social sense or filters? It\u2019s one of the things my partner does, no filters, says what comes to his mind, and he\u2019s high functioning Aspie \ud83d\ude0e", "While I wholeheartedly agree, my point was mainly about the fact that suggesting something doesnt automatically mean you make the choice instead of the mother. Which the commenter accused the other commenter from.", "They make a thing that goes on the inside bottom of the ring to resize.", "\u201cShe didn\u2019t need to hear that comment\u201d \nGets ring back, you call her exactly that.\n\nYTA", "Right here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130gg6w/aita_my_friend_is_pregnant_to_a_man_she_barely/jhwigg3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3. \n\nEveryone else is TA because they judged on what OP said, instead of the hypothetical possibility that OP is on the spectrum and unable to control themselves? Seems a bit of a reach to me but ok.", "Fair, but I would argue that in this type of case even the suggestion is pushing an agenda. If the friend said \u2018I\u2019ve thought it through and I\u2019m going to get an abortion\u2019 and OP said \u2018you know you could keep it!\u2019, that\u2019s pushing their agenda. And in exactly the same way, the friend excitedly saying \u2018We\u2019re going to have a baby!\u2019, OP replying with \u2018you could get an abortion\u2019 is an agenda. In both these cases, unless someone asks you to talk about their options, then it\u2019s not appropriate to suggest a different choice than the one they have made.", "I had one of these, but it fell off without me realising. And then my ring fell off at night in the garden. Luckily my husband found it the next day! \n\nThey work really well, but perhaps I need a better one than the one o got off Amazon", "The point is that there's no need to pile on and make her feel worse when she's already extremely upset. Once she got the ring back and everything was okay, her friend could gently tell her that she was careless and offer advice so it doesn't happen again. There's nuance to the situation."]}
