I banned my mother and she actually tried to get on the ward as I was pushing. The midwife had to come ask me if I would let her in. I said no! If people won't respect your boundaries you have to get sterner reinforcing them.", "NTA, and make sure the hospital staff have her photo so they know not to let her in.", "That definitely sounds like a toxic relationship. If she can't even respect you, or your wishes, & is projecting her beliefs on you when you're about to undergo one of the most difficult things that a person can go through, then she likely won't have respect for your child as well. That kind of behavior creeps me out on a whole other level. It's your body, your labor, & your child. NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re the one giving birth and your comfort in your most vulnerable moment is what matters. You have every right to only have people you want there in the room.", "At the risk of sounding like the asshole myself here, she doesn\u2019t need to understand your boundaries. She needs to comply with them. The \u2018understanding\u2019 frame shows you\u2019re  thinking about her feelings and prioritising them over your own, and I understand after a lifetime this feels normal but I promise she can be trained (\u2018compliance\u2019). \n\nYou need to make her wear the discomfort in the moment, not you. Next time she touches you, grab her hand and move it off. \u201cWow mom, that was weird and gross after I asked you not to keep touching me. Do you not remember? Do we need to get you tested for dementia?\u201d \n\n\u201cI have asked you not to touch me. It\u2019s disrespectful you can\u2019t stop. Seek help.\u201d If she does it again, tell her to leave. \n\nI saw a friend of mine slap an unwanted hand off her pregnant belly; epic move and the offender never tried again. \n\nGrab her hand. Move away. Make her uncomfortable. \n\nOn being in the delivery room, MAKE IT WEIRD. \u201cWhy do want to look at my vagina tearing open?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s weird you want to see me naked.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s gross you want to have a thrupple moment with me and the answer is no.\u201d \u201cIf your wanted to re-live your mom watching you ruin your pelvic floor, you should have filmed it.\u201d\n\nI suspect many will thank I\u2019m over-reacting here. Slapping your parent is a big call. But if she\u2019s comfortable with stomping your boundaries: what\u2019s she going to make your kid do, that your kid isn\u2019t comfortable with? What happens when she forces your kid to do things they don\u2019t want to \u2018because grandma\u2019 and keep secrets?\n\nTrain her now. Otherwise, regret it later. NTA.", "NTA. Labor and delivery are NOT a spectator sport. You need to be able to focus on the very real work you are going to be doing.

Someone who just gets you, Someone who can help you focus. But this is your ball game, you call the shots, nobody else.", "NTA. Bringing your child into the world is a very intimate and personal experience. It is 100% up to you how you want to handle the situation in the delivery room. This moment belongs to you and your precious baby girl. Do what you feel is best for the both of you. Wishing you all the best for your big day.", "NTA. I've never give birth before, but when/if I will, I'd only want people there, that will make me comfortable and respect my boundaries. If your mother doesn't do that, she has no business being in the delivery room with you.\n\nI know a thing about mothers like yours, I have one myself. Boundaries are really hard to set and protect. But it's worth it. I told her, that I wouldn't bother with boundaries if I didn't care about her. So either she accepts or there'll be a lot more distance. Also greystoning helps.\n\nEdit: have a save delivery and congrats on your pregnancy!", "NTA and I'd say it's a very wise decision. Feeling secure is a huge part of a happy birthing, very underestimated imo. You have your midwife and your doula, that's plenty already. Let them know your mother may try to insist on coming so they're prepared to block her if they have to.", "NTA. Giving birth makes you so vulnerable.

Mom should not be forcing herself into the delivery room. \n\nTell your mom that you need to focus on yourself and the baby and she will have plenty of opportunity for granny duties once the baby is born. \n\nIt could be that your mom is highly anxious but that is not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nNo-one has a say in who's in the delivery room other than the mother-to-be.\n\nYour mother sounds a tad overbearing.

That is the best way to keep her in the dark.", "NTA. Since when did giving birth become a spectator sport? I admit I don\u2019t have children so a, only guessing but I would have thought the only people who need to be present are the mother obviously), the father if that\u2019s what you both want & any medical people required.", "NTA but I think you need to think about what role you want your mother to play in yours and especially your child\u2019s life going forward. Think about areas you might be a bit more relaxed (gift giving?) and areas that require explicit permission each time (belly touching?) and hard nos (being in the delivery room?). Or maybe you want to be low or no contact? Try and think of all the things she does that annoys/stresses you out/makes you uncomfortable individually and make a plan. Practice saying no firmly and walking away.\n\nWhen I had a similar situation, I had to leave the situation for months and feel the peace not having that person in my life gave me. When I let them back in we went slow and I felt so much better equipped to enforce boundaries to protect that peace.", "Relax, breathe. No one is allowed in delivery unless you request that person. I'm not sure of today's  rules, but when I gave birth, only people allowed in delivery had taken the prenatal classes. But, regardless it is your call if she were to enter. You may want to think about while in a hospital bed waiting to go into delivery is she allowed to sit with you? They limit number of family, things to consider. As far as her touching your belly, I don't know, my family never touched except maybe a shoulder pat, cheek kiss when parting. If others try to hug I have an embarrassing jerk away motion that pops my back and shoulders it shocks others. Funny, my close friends over the years will say things like 'easy, I'm  about to hug you', they tease, but I am able to hug now with warning. Maybe, tease your Mom, say okay you can touch, but I'm  counting to 10. One touch each time you see her. She is your Mother, but you are an adult soon to have a child, you are the one to make decisions. She will not be in control at the hospital. Your Nurses will only consider your wishes, your decisions. It's  all about you. Take charge of the moment.", "Hello! \nI believe you are not the asshole.\nIn the process of giving birth, you should be the most comfortable, and if you know the presence of your mother will be difficult for you, perhaps it is truly better if she won't be there.\nHowever, I do recommend you discuss it with her and settle things, since she might get more offended if she doesn't know the reason as to why she's not invited.\nHave a good day!\n~Lian\ud83e\udd8b", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
