I went through something similar with my family when my mom and I were taking care of my widowed grandmother, who had dementia. It was often easier on my grandma especially if we knew family was coming over-like, one aunt had a regular time she visited, so she was in the clear-because my mom and I could remind my grandma that this or that family member was coming over. It was also easier on me due to being autistic; I had stuff that I do every week and sometimes, said family members would be showing up right as I would be needing to leave for said stuff or be parked in the driveway when I was coming back and be 'Oh, I forgot' when they'd be covering for me with my grandma when my mom was working. It was just one more added stressor to an already stressful situation. When I'd say something to my mom about how I'd like to at least have some knowledge that they were coming over, all I'd get is 'Grandma's their mom; they have every right to see her whenever they want' when that wasn't what I was asking for at all. I wasn't asking that they come over less often or asking if they could come to visit, but rather at least some warning (preferably a 'hey, we're on our way' phone call or text) that they were coming over.", "NTA. They know what you want but don't care.\n\nIf they knock, don't answer. Turn on sprinklers that cover the door area and your room's window area. If you feel like it, yell, \"Bad cat!\"\n\nThey'll quickly find it less humorous and less of a sport to intentionally ignore your wishes.", "Nta. It may take awhile to break people from this habit , but keep at it, they will eventually stop.", "NTA, calling ahead of time and 'asking' if it's okay to stop by is the polite and respectful thing to do. Rule applies to everyone, even family.", "NTA. \n\nHoly crap. You're a fair bit nicer than me. I'd have bought blackout curtains and would simply never come to the door except for planned, expected visits. \n\nYou're not being rude. You are, in fact, the only person involved who seems to have any concept of etiquette.", "NTA. If you've explained your perspective and they are choosing to laugh and/or ignore it. They are the AH. Hold the boundary you need. It's pretty inconsiderate to show up at someone's door unannounced and expect to be let in.", "NTA. It's super annoying and kinda rude for people to show up without calling first, and then especially if they insist that you answer. Like, ok, it's probably not \"rude\" if they knock and you don't answer and they go away. But repeatedly knocking and refusing to take the hint is definitely very rude on their part. Either way, you're allowed to not want uninvited guests.", "NTA\nI don't like surprise visitors either and ignoring them was the only way to get them to stop. Frustrating. I wouldn't answer the door to them at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
