And maybe a bit the AH for not taking her hand and leaving together when they wouldn\u2019t let up.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got her back now. And take family dinner meet-and-greets off the table for the future.\n\nIf your sisters had concerns about her, they could have raised them with you privately (and you could have told them to get lost). Being rude to her wasn\u2019t the way to handle it.", "Nah OP even if it turns out she sucks you sisters have no business doing that, that is for you to figure out.", "NTA. They were out of line. I am an older sister (21F) and my brother is (17M) and I would never treat his girlfriend like that; especially without a reason to. They were rude from the jump and didn\u2019t even give her a chance.", "NTA. how old is she? assuming she is 17 too, it's completely normal for her to have a parent paying for her online shopping. as for if shes passing, if her parents don't care it's probably not borderline failing either. its also normal to not have done these things at 17, but you should prolly recognize other people do/did.", "NTA.\n\nYou're 17. I'm guessing your GF is around the same age. What \"catastrophe\" are your dear sisters protecting you from? It's not like you're going to get married next week. They used the dinner as an excuse to kick you around the court and act like condescending @#$#heads.", "Nta. I wouldn\u2019t do this again. Nope. I would also tell them they\u2019ve lost the privilege of meeting any future girlfriends. And if they didn\u2019t get it right and apologize\u2026there would be no meeting the fianc\u00e9 and no meeting the wife down the road. And if they wanted to continue being total a holes\u2026they wouldn\u2019t get to meet their future nieces or nephews (if that\u2019s in the cards). Being your sisters doesn\u2019t give them the right to bully people.", "NTA, it's none of their business, even if she ends up being a totally spoiled airhead, they shouldn't be saying these things to her or you.", "NTA\n\nEven if they don\u2019t like your girlfriend, they were purposefully mean-spirited. That\u2019s absolutely not okay. If they have questions about the sustainability of her lifestyle, there\u2019s a way to address that privately with you and be polite to her in the meantime.", "A bit ESH, I think. They seem a bit full-on, for a girl you've dated for a month at 17. I assume you currently have no plans for anything serious with this girl, like moving in? And you aren't doing anything like paying less attention to school, just because this girl doesn't like class? \n\nIf you're just dating and having fun (and keeping up your responsibilities), they're overthinking it. At 17, you're just testing dating, finding out who you like, etc. They don't need to fry her, like you're planning to marry her or something. However, it was maybe a bit immature to block them. This is just a disagreement with family, not abuse or anything else that requires no-contact. \n\nIt's just practice in setting boundaries with family. So you'd maybe be better to simply message them, and tell them you know they are protective - but they were too full-on. Tell them it's your choice who you date, and you don't want to hear anymore. If they then keep badgering you, just ignore them.", "NTA Your sisters are mean britches. Present or future girlfriends should never be subjected to their abuse. Keep them blocked.", "ESH, their concerns are valid tho the approach is a bit off, your gf sounds like a spoiled airhead, and you need some self reflection on your taste in women, try thinking with your head, not your dick.", "NTA. But your sisters and your gf feel like two sides of the same coin, idk. Blocking them is a bit much, but I believe in \"distance makes hearts fonder.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also many kids her age find school boring.\n\nMaybe she caught onto what the sisters were doing and gave phony answers to them."]}
