Fran saw me(from outside the door)so I kinda loosely said I wouldn't be seeing her for awhile but I cared for her very much.

I am an older lady and some neighbors who were nice to me, say 60 years ago, I still appreciate and think about occasionally. Kids do deserve closure, and answers.  The other neighbor invited you in and you said goodbye. Personally I would say NTA.", "NTA: you went to talk to the PARENTS who you didn't know weren't gonna be there. Fran saw you before you walked away and what people expect you to ignore a kid you nanny for years? \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. \n\nParents on the other hand are the A**holes. You did nothing wrong. They made it clear that they didn\u2019t want anymore contact. It is painful not being able to say goodbye to someone you cared for 3 years. And it is totally understandable that you\u2019d want to say goodbye to the kid, and I\u2019m sorry you gotta deal with such bigoted folks. Hope you find more open minded people.", " NTA and I just don't get all the ESH or YTA votes. You didn't go to directly talk to the kid. You went to question the parents about their shitty sudden turn. You're exactly the same person now that you were for the last several YEARS that you cared for their kid, and they proved to be shitty people. \n\nBut YOU didn't go up to talk to the kid, you went to talk to the parents and were given the opportunity by the babysitter to say hi and there's nothing wrong there. You did NOTHING WRONG. So please don't forget that. \n\nI'm sorry that both you and Franny have to suffer because the parents are garbage.", "NTA.\n\nLiterally the only reason they're doing this can be discriminatory. They'd rather have their kid deal with possession feelings of abandonment than let a LGBTQ person around their kid.", "NTA. While I don't think it was entirely the wisest thing to go to their apartment after they specifically said you are not welcome; that kid needed some closure. You were a big part of their life for the past 3 years and to suddenly disappear would give them trust issues.  You explained to her that you would be going away, that you still care about her, and you didn't put blame on the parents.", "NTA. Also if there was a contract or they owe money demand it. They cannot fire you for sexual orientation.", "NTA.\n\nYou went to talk the issue through with them, but they weren't there. Kid happened to see you and you told them goodbye. Pretty straight-up reasonable.\n\nYou also could literally run into them on any day in the building you both live in. You did nothing sneaky or nefarious.  I bet they were going to tell Fran that YOU quit and didn't want to see her anymore, so they could take the \"Good Guy\" role when she gets upset.\n\nAnd they're just full on AH for being homophobic chumps.", "You are NTA and I\u2019m so sorry this happened. Her parents do not seem well adjusted, so it is probably better to steer clear of the family which you seem to plan on doing. They\u2019re assholes and you did not deserve to be treated this way.\n\nEditing to add, sounds like their daughter is sad you won\u2019t be babysitting! Pretty pathetic they put their own hatred of others over the love they have for their child. \n\nIt\u2019s weird of them to blame you for \u201cmanipulating\u201d her when this was a really sudden change for her and that\u2019s usually going to be very upsetting to kids! \n\nI developed issues as a kid from never going to say some really important goodbyes (my parents were trying to shelter me but it did a lot of damage) so in the long run what you did was maybe better for her even if her parents are mad. I get why others are saying E S H after they asked you not to show up, but this is why I think you\u2019re not the asshole.", "NTA. They live a floor up--you were going to see them at some point.\n\nEven though they told you not to contact them, a response to abrupt termination of employment like that is a conversation--as you said, you wanted to talk to the parents and expected them to be there.\n\nMorally, because they've likely lied to the kid, I think you absolutely had the right to say good-bye and let the kid know that you cared and did not just abandon here--for her mental health, and because their defamation of you could hurt your reputation with that child and even for possible future work. (Even if you were fired for cause, unless it was harming the child, it seems inherently reasonable that you get to deliver this message.)\n\nThe parents already hated you, apparently because they're bigots, so you can now go on with your life, greeting the child warmly with a smile if you ever see her.", "NTA. You live one floor below them and they thought they could tell an 8 year old that you just disappeared?? They were kidding themselves about that, plus they were deprioritizing their daughter's feelings over their own homophobia so no, NTA. I think you did just the right thing and now they're reaping what they sowed.", "Nta. You didnt go inside or say anything uncouth. Ppl are saying you're wrong for attempting to contact them against their wishes but it's so rude to fire you and expect you to not say a single word back.
