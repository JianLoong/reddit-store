She's honestly such an angel and I was super lucky to get to take care of her since we got along well and she never really started any trouble. It was also nice since they live in the same apartment complex as me.\n\nAnyways, I recently just started dating again for the first time since then due to a rough breakup. I ran into Fran's parents while out on a date with my girlfriend who made it pretty clear they were uncomfortable that I was gay. Literally that night, I got a sudden text message saying they found a new nanny that worked better for their needs and that I wouldn't be welcome in their home again and not to contact them.\n\nI'm still pissed off, because we got along all fine until they realized I was a lesbian?? Anyways I went the next morning to question them in person since they live a floor up from me and saw they had gotten the neighbor to babysit who recognized me and invited me in(edit: I didnt go in and her parents were normally home during this time so I expected to talk to them instead). Fran saw me(from outside the door)so I kinda loosely said I wouldn't be seeing her for awhile but I cared for her very much. I felt that I couldn't just abandon this kid who I've been watching for years now without a reason. Anyways, her parents ended up banging on my door today and yelling me out saying I went behind their back to manipulate their kid.\n\nJust wanted to hear what people say because I guess I could've emailed/called first asking to see Franny one last time to clear things but went over in person instead.\n\nUpdate: Well, things escalated quickly. I sent them a final email asking for my final paycheck and to apologize for showing up at their door. Not sure who but someone chucked a couple dollars worth of spare change at my door \ud83d\ude43 Thank god my lease is coming up, time to start apartment hunting.

I am an older lady and some neighbors who were nice to me, say 60 years ago, I still appreciate and think about occasionally. Kids do deserve closure, and answers.  The other neighbor invited you in and you said goodbye. Personally I would say NTA.", "NTA: you went to talk to the PARENTS who you didn't know weren't gonna be there. Fran saw you before you walked away and what people expect you to ignore a kid you nanny for years? \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. \n\nParents on the other hand are the A**holes. You did nothing wrong. They made it clear that they didn\u2019t want anymore contact. It is painful not being able to say goodbye to someone you cared for 3 years. And it is totally understandable that you\u2019d want to say goodbye to the kid, and I\u2019m sorry you gotta deal with such bigoted folks. Hope you find more open minded people.", " NTA and I just don't get all the E S H or Y T A votes. You didn't go to directly talk to the kid. You went to question the parents about their shitty sudden turn. You're exactly the same person now that you were for the last several YEARS that you cared for their kid, and they proved to be shitty people. \n\nBut YOU didn't go up to talk to the kid, you went to talk to the parents and were given the opportunity by the babysitter to say hi and there's nothing wrong there. You did NOTHING WRONG. So please don't forget that. \n\nI'm sorry that both you and Franny have to suffer because the parents are garbage.", "NTA.\n\nLiterally the only reason they're doing this can be discriminatory. They'd rather have their kid deal with possession feelings of abandonment than let a LGBTQ person around their kid.", "NTA. While I don't think it was entirely the wisest thing to go to their apartment after they specifically said you are not welcome; that kid needed some closure. You were a big part of their life for the past 3 years and to suddenly disappear would give them trust issues.  You explained to her that you would be going away, that you still care about her, and you didn't put blame on the parents.", "NTA. Also if there was a contract or they owe money demand it. They cannot fire you for sexual orientation.", "NTA.\n\nYou went to talk the issue through with them, but they weren't there. Kid happened to see you and you told them goodbye. Pretty straight-up reasonable.\n\nYou also could literally run into them on any day in the building you both live in. You did nothing sneaky or nefarious.  I bet they were going to tell Fran that YOU quit and didn't want to see her anymore, so they could take the \"Good Guy\" role when she gets upset.\n\nAnd they're just full on AH for being homophobic chumps.", "You are NTA and I\u2019m so sorry this happened. Her parents do not seem well adjusted, so it is probably better to steer clear of the family which you seem to plan on doing. They\u2019re assholes and you did not deserve to be treated this way.\n\nEditing to add, sounds like their daughter is sad you won\u2019t be babysitting! Pretty pathetic they put their own hatred of others over the love they have for their child. \n\nIt\u2019s weird of them to blame you for \u201cmanipulating\u201d her when this was a really sudden change for her and that\u2019s usually going to be very upsetting to kids! \n\nI developed issues as a kid from never going to say some really important goodbyes (my parents were trying to shelter me but it did a lot of damage) so in the long run what you did was maybe better for her even if her parents are mad. I get why others are saying E S H after they asked you not to show up, but this is why I think you\u2019re not the asshole.", "NTA. They live a floor up--you were going to see them at some point.\n\nEven though they told you not to contact them, a response to abrupt termination of employment like that is a conversation--as you said, you wanted to talk to the parents and expected them to be there.\n\nMorally, because they've likely lied to the kid, I think you absolutely had the right to say good-bye and let the kid know that you cared and did not just abandon here--for her mental health, and because their defamation of you could hurt your reputation with that child and even for possible future work. (Even if you were fired for cause, unless it was harming the child, it seems inherently reasonable that you get to deliver this message.)\n\nThe parents already hated you, apparently because they're bigots, so you can now go on with your life, greeting the child warmly with a smile if you ever see her.", "NTA. You live one floor below them and they thought they could tell an 8 year old that you just disappeared?? They were kidding themselves about that, plus they were deprioritizing their daughter's feelings over their own homophobia so no, NTA. I think you did just the right thing and now they're reaping what they sowed.", "Nta. You didnt go inside or say anything uncouth. Ppl are saying you're wrong for attempting to contact them against their wishes but it's so rude to fire you and expect you to not say a single word back.

So yeah, I feel for that little girl.", "I\u2019m a nanny and I was fired without cause - I was asking to receive breaks as mandated by the state of California and the dad didn\u2019t work he mostly hung out in his office or golfed - and they did not allow me to say goodbye to their special needs daughter I\u2019ve been taking care of for almost 2 years. It was horribly cruel and it makes me so fucking sad - for both of us.", "I'd love to know how they explained to Franny that OP won't be around anymore", "My thoughts for sure! I recall my aunt( only 10 years older than me:) taking me to say goodbye to a lady who watched me sometimes when I was 5. It felt good to know WHY I wouldn\u2019t see her anymore! I really liked the lady. We played paper dolls ( yep that old:) and would have been so confused", "u/PastTomorrowk is a bot.", "I feel bad. Anyone daring to point this out like you (or me is being down voted into oblivion because apparently it's okay to do something wrong if the other people are assholes too) \ud83d\ude44", "Eh I was under the impression it read the first one it encountered and ignored everything else. But changed anyway (though maybe it's too late at this point)", "Wait.. there's a bot that actually tracks this stuff?\n\nBetter throw I'm my answer as NTA", "The only answer that counts for judgment is the top-voted post, and apparently, even if the bot can't recognise the judgment of the top post it gets sent to the mods to resolve.", "Wrong reply? What are you talking about?", "Ooh, you should totally bad mouth them to all the sitters you know.", "OP, what state are you in, out of morbid curiosity?", "You\u2019re correct. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter why the parents didn\u2019t want her there or if they\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s their child and their wishes should have been respected.", "Yea I\u2019m surprised at all the comments saying NTA. If this was a dude saying he went back after his ex told him he wasn\u2019t welcome at her house anymore everyone in the comments would be calling him a creep and to respect her boundaries\ud83e\udd28. Everyone is making it about the sexual orientation which if they read the post it obviously has something to do with it but literally what OP is asking about anyways is if she was an asshole for going to the home after being told she was fired. She clearly was and knows it. OP you are lucky you don\u2019t live in Texas btw. There\u2019s a lot of us who aren\u2019t progressive liberals like most on Reddit and will not tolerate anything when it comes to our kids. Don\u2019t let these comments fool you as you know what you did was an asshole move and wrong. Im certain you know that because you already admitted in the comments that you did not call the parents or text them asking to talk in person because you knew they would not agree to it. So you circumvented that and went straight to their home after being told you aren\u2019t welcome. It will cost you you\u2019re life next time OP. People don\u2019t play those games anymore. Read the room and watch the news more\ud83e\uddd0. People have been killed for less. Disclaimer for those who are angry reading this well I don\u2019t read replies hardly at all. Won\u2019t on this one\ud83e\udd73.", "Screw those parents, they\u2019re bigots and you have nothing to be embarrassed about. Let them be the awkward ones, if you see them, be proud of who you are. Kiss your girlfriend, be happy, and let them be the ones who rush away while you stand proud!", "They weren't even calling out homophobia. They were also owed a paycheck. But yes this is in no way the same situation.", "I doubt any judge is going to issue a restraining order for trying to contact an employer *who lives in the same building* to wrap up an employment relationship.", "What judge do you think is going to give someone a restraining order for walking upstairs and knocking on a door one time?", "She spoke to the kid without parental permission. Sorry, but if someone is asked to not speak to my kid(s) did so on private, I'd be pissed too.", "she can call them on the phone. . .", "Sue them immediately for your back pay. They are trash humans. NTA", "NTA.  Every parent informed the child that OP had relocated.", "Imo OP would have been NTA even if she threw the parents under the bus when saying bye and ruined whatever that explanation was.\n\nMight be helpful for the kid to know in case she would also be the target of her parents' bigotry.", "Why do you say that?", "I disagree that in all cases \u201cnever contact me again\u201d has to be respected immediately. If you have a long close relationship with someone and they literally out of the blue, without any other discussion or conflict, just say \u201cnever contact me again\u201d I think you have a right to a little pushback. Especially if it\u2019s your employer. OP is not a stalker, had not been warned or had a performance issue, she was fired out of hand and I think it\u2019s reasonable she attempt to have a conversation about it with the employer. If she worked at McDonalds and showed up at the managers home she\u2019d have been out of line. But their home is her place of work. And people deserve explanations for things. If I turned to my partner of five years and said, \u201cI\u2019m breaking up with you - never contact me again\u201d would anyone actually expect them to gather their things and leave without another word?", "That might be true. My source is other redditors \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It does not, the only thing that actually matters is the judgement in the top comment. People seem to have this idea that they are voting by adding their own judgments, but really you are voting by upvoting the most popular comment you agree with.", "I think OP means, since they live in the same building, that they're going to be trying to avoid the parents for multiple reasons. I wouldn't want to run into homophobic people unexpectedly either", "It's a bot", "Aside from using slurs or saying \u201cwe are firing you because you\u2019re LGBTQ\u201d, this has to be one of the more clear cut cases of discrimination though, right? She was the nanny for years with absolutely no issues and immediately after they saw her with her girlfriend they abruptly terminated employment. \n\nI don\u2019t think this is actionable because it\u2019s not a business with more employees, but if it were, I\u2019d imagine a situation like this would be considered a major legal liability. It\u2019s a shame labor laws have so many loopholes.", "The first part of this response is obviously a bullshit false equivalence, but the second half, where you basically say those neighbors would have reason to fucking shoot and kill their previous babysitter for coming back to have a discussion... That's some straight up evil and inhuman shit. You are exactly what is wrong with the US right now.", "They live in an apartment. She has as much right to the fucking hallway as they do.", "She wasn't in their home. She was in the shared hallway of their apartment building. Because they owe her money.", "OP has mentioned in other comments \"talking through\" was for her final paycheck and maybe saying goodbye to the kid, not changing their mind abt being homophobes.", "She didn't seek out the kid. The kid just happened to see her. She went there because it's a time when usually the parents are there. What should she have done? Acting like the kid doesn't exist?", "Yeah, but they atleast acknowledged that the child would be upset by not telling her the truth. I hate people like these. They treat their daughter like a doll whom they can hand to someone and take back whenever they want. And the nanny might as well not exist for them. Like this person was taking care of your daughter! And they treated her as an object which has outlived its utility for them.", "Yes. Parents need to realize that even though they see a nanny as an employee, the child sees the nanny as a member of their family.", "NTA. Your neighbors are bigots and homophobes. You didn't do anything behind their back. They just weren't home when you went by. Screw them.", "Doesn\u2019t apply to people you employ in your home.", "she didn\u2019t go in their home though? she made an impulsive decision that might not be been the smartest, but she wasn\u2019t an asshole. she had a whole job where she bonded with these people for years! and they just cut her off immediately like that? anyone would\u2019ve wanted to at least get some face to face closure. she\u2019s not the asshole, the homophobes are.", "The parents are raging assholes but I agree she should not have entered a home where she knew she was not wanted.", "Yes I would. If someone I told not to come to my home did that I'd probably call the police. If she saw them and the hallway and tried to talk to the parents I'd be on her side. But she went to their apartment after being told she wasn't welcome. \n\nNot that it's entirely relevant but if you got fired from a job and tried to go back to talk about it you'd have security called on you instantly.", "It's federally illegal to fire someone for being gay.", "Lol ew even grosser.", "Where did you get \"owe her money\" from? Not in the post for sure. That would change things. Also she went to the apartment and knocked on the door. You think that's really different?", "No, but she shouldn't have gotten I to the discussion after the parents explicitly told her not to.", "They probably told their daughter that it was OP's doing. Laid the blame on OP, not themselves. That's why they didn't want OP to talk to her.", "In theory it probably shouldn't. But in practicality it does work that way because in larger companies the bias is more clear, and smaller businesses are small potatoes. Unless an applicant can somehow prove that bigotry is the reason for not getting hired/getting fired.", "She didn't.", "She didn't.", "Depending on the job and how you're paid you may need to return to pick up a last paycheck which is part of what OP was doing per her additional comments.", "You can be, they're just not able to say that out loud. Unless they are dumb enough to actually state out loud or put in writing that you are specifically being fired for being a member of a protected class, there's not a whole lot you can do. They just say \"it's not working out\" or \"business needs have changed\", and they're in the clear.", "Under the update she said she wanted her final paycheck.", "Except that OP knocked and the neighbor **invited her in**. Sure, the homophobic parents said she wasn\u2019t welcome in their home, but the neighbor (who was there at the time, unlike the parents) **invited her in**. NTA", "That\u2019s been the regulation for more at least 15 years", "What makes it ok to go knock on the door of a home you were told  you were not welcome in?", "OP, you did nothing wrong. Please, don't let fools like these make you question otherwise.\n\nBeing queer and being terminated for being queer is leaps and bounds worse than literally *knocking on a door in an apartment building you literally live in* and I don't think doing so is overstepping boundaries. \n\nIt doesn't even constitute as trespassing, for crying out loud.", "But going to someone's house and then entering a place where you knew you weren't welcome isn't adult behavior.  Send an email or a letter.  Private property rights are a thing even for bigoted shitheads  like these.", "She also said they hadn\u2019t paid her, so no, they can\u2019t just suddenly cut off contact and expect to never hear from her again. F those people.", "she literally said she didn\u2019t go inside. she didn\u2019t even enter the house.", "They rent an apartment. They don't have property, and they don't own the hallway."]}
