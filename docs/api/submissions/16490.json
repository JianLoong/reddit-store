I used to eat like that too, but this year I went away to college, and got convinced by some friends to start working out. I reoriented my diet as well, and started eating lots of lean meat, nuts, fruit, vegetables and dairy, cutting out a lot of junk food I used to eat like pizza, ice cream, gummy bears, doritos, etc. \n\nThis showed results, and so I stuck with it. At a certain point I stopped having any sort of desire for unhealthy food. I would eat pizza or whatever if it was the only thing available at the dining hall that day, or occasionally go out to eat with my friends, but it didn\u2019t ever taste as good as it used to.

Also think about the fact that what they are asking you do would make you uncomfortable, both physically and emotionally", "NTA\n\nThey feel judged because they have a chip on their shoulder.

I will gladly cook for you guys if you want, and I have no issues with whatever you choose to eat.\"", "They are uncomfortable with you living a healthy lifestyle? Maybe the question, \u201cJust to be clear, you want me to put my own health at risk so you don\u2019t feel bad about the way you eat? I am not judging your diet, but this is just how i eat now. Can you allow me the grace to eat what makes my body feel good and you can eat what makes you comfortable? I won\u2019t judge your diet if you don\u2019t judge mine :)\u201d", "NTA. You did not judge them, you did not tell or make them eat your food. They see you doing well and know they should change their own habits if they want to do better. They seem to not know how to cope with that realization and are now blaming you for it. But you are not to blame in any way. They should figure themselves out and I applaud you for doing great! Stand your ground and live the way you think you should live it for yourself.", "NTA- if they feel that uncomfortable watching someone eat healthy food, perhaps they need to revaluate their own diets.  Being skinny doesn't equal health.", "NTA, they\u2019re just projecting their own insecurities. It\u2019s not your job or your responsibility to manage other people\u2019s insecurity for them. It is however, your job and your responsibility to look out for yourself and take care of yourself. So tell them where to shove it.", "NTA. Your body, your choice what you put in to it. Their asking you to eat worse, like them, just shows they are inherently uncomfortable with their choices. That's their problem. I guess the compromise is do not eat around them.", "NTA. This is such a weird situation. If you were belittling them as they eat with like snide comments or telling them they should eat like you too then it would be a different story. It sounds like they know how bad their eating habits are and instead of fixing it they are taking it out on you. As long as you don't put them down for their eating habits then I wouldn't change anything. \n\nPS: I eat wicked unhealthy food daily (I know I should fix this, I'm working on it) and even for me this seems ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nThey are just jealous of your progress. Don\u2019t stoop down to their level", "Your family are the assholes here. A family should support and encourage each other- especially when you decided to make a healthy and positive change. They fact that they are attempting to shame you into reverting back to your previously unhealthy habits is extremely selfish of them. Seems to me that they are oozing insecurity. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t willingly make them uncomfortable\u201d is insane. A person is responsible for their own emotions. Do not allow them to gaslight you back into your bad habits. Continue to eat healthily and keep it up in the gym. Sorry your family isn\u2019t Supportive, OP. If it means anything I\u2019m proud of you. Stay disciplined and keep those positive friends close.", "NTA - I was ready to pop in here with a Y T A as I assumed you made them uncomfortable due to your preaching and open judgment, but apparently it\u2019s really the fact that a vegetable made it across the threshold of their home that\u2019s made them upset. Now they\u2019d have an argument if they couldn\u2019t afford to pay for your separate diet and/or you required much more expensive foods, but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re saying.", "NTA.  Your family needs to manage their own feelings, not make you responsible for them.  It's ironic that they want to make *you* feel uncomfortable in order to avoid feeling uncomfortable themselves.", "NTA.  You are doing you, and hurting no one.

They're insecure about how they eat and they're making you the bad guy instead of confronting their own feelings or making any changes for themselves. \n\nInstead of being happy for the positive changes you've made for yourself, they're jealous, and trying to justify themselves by pretending you're some elitist asshole who's putting others down for the way they eat.
