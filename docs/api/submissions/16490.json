Part of the \"family table\" is the sharing aspect. Spending time together. Sharing your day. Sharing thoughts. Sharing food. Its possible to share food, for both sides to decide to compromise, if their feelings stem from this place.The simplest solution is a salad or a side dish for the whole family to share. Their food. Your food and Our food. A basic green salad is a good option. Everyone can share. Each person can add what they choose, or in your case don't choose, to customize their salad bowl to their taste.
