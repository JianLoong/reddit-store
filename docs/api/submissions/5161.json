We've been dating for over 2 years. I study creative writing while she studies acting. She knows that writing is a lifelong passion of mine. \n\nMy aim is to be a published author once I graduate and am currently writing multiple stories. My girlfriend wants to be an actress and that was the case when I met her also (we met at a drama class.) We always joked about me writing sometimes and then her starring in an adaption of it.\n\nShe's told me she believed I'd be a famous bestselling author one day and whenever I tell her about my story idea she's always really enthusiastic and helps me name characters, come up with appearances for them and curated music playlists for lots of stories and characters I've made.\n\nRecently she informed me that she had started taking a writing course, which surprised me. She had never expressed an interest in writing besides helping me with ideas from time to time. She told me that before she discovered acting she actually wanted to be a writer when she was a child. (I've verified this as true) \n\n\nWhen I asked if she'd show me some of her work from the course, she seemed really shy about it and insisted that it was bad and I wouldn't want to see. When she finally showed me and I was surprised at how good it was for a beginner. She told me she's probably not that good at it since it's been a few years since she's written 'properly' (has she been doing this the whole time?) \n\nI also told her that it seemed a bit late to suddenly begin a new career path, since being a writer is hard work and she's already busy with her acting course. I told her she can't choose both and that she'd need to decide on one for her future. I also expressed my shock by telling her I didn't think she was into writing, and questioned her about why she didn't tell me before now since I've never seen her write anything.\n\nI feel bad since she seemed so excited to tell me, and talked about how we can 'inspire eachother' and discuss our ideas together, and now she doesn't seem to want to show me anything she writes or has written, even if I express interest.\n\nIt has been tense between us since then and I feel like she's being cold towards me. I think she can tell that something is wrong but I didn't want to talk about it, since I know it will probably make me me sound like a jealous asshole. So I've just been telling her that I'm fine.\n\nAm I the Asshole for this? I feel like it was a little blunt and rude of me but I always express my truth to her, and I still believe that it would be impractical for her to persue both writing and acting especially when I'm already a writer and we're planning to get married once we're done with college.", "created_utc": 1671500619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqajyb/aita_for_discouraging_my_girlfriends_new_hobby/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her work was better than yours and it upset you and made you jealous, so you decided to tell her to quit.\n\nAlso a lot of actors have multiple skills in the industry, including trying their hand at things like writing and directing.", "YTA\n\n1. Do you have any idea how many actors also write screenplays? Lots.\n\n2. She's 19 and you're saying it's \"too late\"?\n\nRegardless of those things, though, you were still out of line.\n\nI'd be doing some soul searching into why you don't want her to be a writer, why you can't both do the same thing. Are you afraid she will do better than you? Whatever the reason, you need to figure it out and deal with it, and make it up to her.\n\nBecause if not, this could easily be the thing that sinks your relationship.", "You\u2019re an idiot.

Stalked some childhood friends and asked them? \n\nI also like the fact you had to clarify that she wasn't just making shit up to strangers on the internet. Like 'don't worry, she wasn't just lying to cover up her burning desire to upstage me, I CHECKED' dude ... we never thought that. That's YOUR insecurity talking. \n\nyou're clearly just upset and panicked that's she's a better writter than you.", "YTA.\n\nI didn't realize that someone couldn't be a double major or double career. Man that sucks for me since I'm a housekeeper and a writer. Ironic huh. Writing has become insanely more popular since the quarantine period. A shit ton of people balance two career focuses with work.\n\nIt sounds like you don't want her to be a writer because she's damn good and she's better being a newbie then you were when you started to write.\n\nJust because YOU want to write doesn't mean she's not allowed to be an writer or an author as well. A marriage can have people in the same career field.\n\nAnd you know full well with acting it's best to have a back up plan just in case. And if writing is her plan B then so be it.\n\nYou need a plan B as well. And a C D E and thru Z everyone should.\n\nSupport her. Just like she supports you.\n\nAnd stop gatekeeping being a writer/author. It's not a pretty look", "You were dishonest and manipulative with the person you say you want to marry. Not great.

Who told you that you can\u2019t pursue anything and everything you want to?? Whoever it was, that limiting belief needs to stop with you. You don\u2019t own writing and she\u2019s been nothing but supportive of you and your dreams. Your response to her reeks of insecurity and I hope she finds someone more supportive of her in return.", "YTA. You also are jealous, controlling, threatened and immature.", "YTA.

Think hard about why you feel threatened.", "YTA she\u2019s NINETEEN, saying it\u2019s too late to start a new career path is laughable. People change careers throughout life. Tbh, you come off as jealous that she is a good writer and that it\u2019s not her main focus, when it is yours. There\u2019s zero reason for you not to be supportive of her other than being selfish.

You are discouraging her simply because she has talent and you are jealous. There is no reason for her not to take any course she wants to take and to pursue any career field or hobby she wants. \n\nAnd it is \"too late\" when she is only 19 years old? My old butt started school September 1st for a new career. It is never too late for her to pursue something. And again, this is simply because she has talent and that upsets you.

I mean eitherway YTA.", "You sound jealous and like a big freaking baby.  Why can't someone pursue acting and writing?  Why can't someone pursue whatever the heck they want?  What are you 90?  uck.  I would unload you so fast.", "YTA - I wouldn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with you after this. A partner should support you and be your biggest fan especially in the industries you both want to enter. Of course she has time for a career change. She is an artist and can explore any artistic medium that she wants.", "Apologize to that girl right now! How would you feel if the person you trusted and loved the most in this world looked down on you or your work? Tell her how you feel, that when you read her work you were so impressed that you became jealous and questioned your own skills and say you\u2019re sorry. Give her encouragement. She will forgive you if you take full responsibility for your actions! And maybe even feel encouraged that you think she\u2019s that good. And for you, try not to compare yourself to others. Her natural talent does not take away from your talent. Jealousy will NEVER bring you any closer to your goals. Only hard work and practice. You can fix this!", "YTA of course. Like seriously how can you think you are not??!!! People can have multiple interests and hobbies. Plenty of people work and have a side gig/hustle/project/whatever you want to call it. It really sounds like you  are insecure and jealous.\n\nAlso, tons of actors work in other fields, and tons of writers work in other fields.", "YTA: quit being insecure that she\u2019s naturally more talented than you", "YTA - wow it really sounds like you\u2019re just jealous of her natural talent and being better at it than you. Also who TF are you to try and crush other peoples dreams!!", "YTA - Who issued you a certificate of know-it-all; at the right age. This is sooo defeating. She trusted you, opened up and SLAM....you're blunt and rude. One can act and write....create music and learn to cook. Why are you limiting her?", "Somebody posthumously warn Carrie Fisher that she can't both act and write.", "YTA, somebody sounds insecure they're not the best at something they love.", "Yta\n\nYou only came up with this silly rule that you can't do both because you are jealous and insecure. Honestly, shame on you. She can very well do both snd be great at it!!", "YTA. You can't gatekeep writing as a hobby. How dare you? You do sound like a jealous asshole.", "YTA.  She can pursue both.  Don\u2019t try to limit her because you have some deeply ingrained idea of \u201cwhat makes a writer\u201d.  \nHow about you support her the same way she seem to truly and wholeheartedly supports you.", "Good lord yes YTA. You're just jealous. Reflect on that. She wanted to share this with you.", "Dude. She\u2019s 19 and \u201cits too late to start a new career path\u201d? I think you may be feeling a little threatened by her talent. YTA.", "YTA. Your gf is so young! Why does she have to pick just one thing that interests her now? Or ever? You do realize plenty of well-adjusted creative people have multiple creative outlets? This reads like you are sabotaging your gf because you don\u2019t like that she\u2019s good at something that you are also good at and you are feeling competitive with her. You should apologize and encourage her to explore all her various interests.", "As both a writer & actress, YTA, seriously. Wowwww.", "Dude, what?! The idea that she can\u2019t be a writer because you were one first is bizarre. And your assertion that she needs to focus on one career is also wild. Most actors and writers juggle 1/2 dozen gigs and talents to make ends meet. If anything, she should be on your ass to choose a backup when your writing career doesn\u2019t pan out. Support your partner in everything she wants to do. YTA", "> it will probably make me me sound like a jealous asshole.\n\n\u201cWill\u201d? Too late, dude. Too late.

Tbh OP you sound a little bitter that she\u2019s good at it and don\u2019t want her to maybe outdo you in something you enjoy. You can\u2019t discourage her interest, she\u2019s her own person and you\u2019ll likely only discourage her interest in YOU.

I\u2019m also amused by your stance that at 19 it\u2019s \u201ctoo late.\u201d My brother retired from his job after 20+ years and had his first novel published when he was 52.", "YTA people can have more than one career. Like singers and actors. Often they can do both. I am not sure why you are being a douch.", "So you are jealous and don\u2019t want to tell her that.\n\nYou did tell her to choose one career because it\u2019s too late in now?

It\u2019s sad you feel that way toward your supportive gf. \n\nAnd definitely YTA for shooting down a talent cause you jealous and can\u2019t admit it.", "Yta, though not a big deal. Just apologize. It\u2019s totally possible to do both; most ppl ur ages are still figuring out their futures.", "Do you know how many professional actors are also writers (vice versa)? I think it\u2019s actually beneficial to do both. YTA and maybe insecure in you\u2019re own writing. No wonder she doesn\u2019t want to show you any more of her work.", "YTA. Do you really believe that she's going to be your only competition in the world of published authors? How many actors and actresses have written books in addition to their acting career? We had an opportunity to support her and her hobby and instead you let your jealousy get the better of you. If something that small bothers you? How are you going to deal with the first time she has to kiss someone for a job?", "OP, you do sound like a jealous AH. YTA. If you suspect she's been writing this whole time, why do you think she can't do both? Why do you think you know best how much she can fit into a day? How is it \"too late\" for her to get into this, as well? Neither of you are even 25 yet. People can have a number of skills and professions throughout their lives. There are plenty of authors and other creators who are highly skilled and they didn't start their most successful careers until they were much older.", "YTA a jealous asshole. Read your own post and try to see it any other way", "What is this nonsense? A passion for writing is a great asset for an actor, and vice versa! Where do you think playwrights and screenwriters come from?\n\n\nEven if she were to scrap drama for writing entirely, she's not a threat to you, that's not how art works. She would be writing with her own voice and from her own experience, just as you would be writing from yours. It's not like she's taking the last seat on the bus.\n\n\nYou could be one part of a collaborative artistic powerhouse, making the both of you better artists as you go. But if you let your petty ego and jealousy get in the way, you're going to lose. Lose your girlfriend, lose her creative support, lose the opportunity to double your network, all of it.\n\n\nI hope she writes with a renewed passion, and ascends to her best potential, with or without you.\n\nYou, I just kinda feel bad for. Get your head out of your ass, dude. YTA.", "YTA. I am astonished she showed you her work. Very little is more vulnerable than a beginning writer with a \u201cnaked\u201d MS. From what you\u2019ve said, there is no way in hell that I would show you any of my own work. Writing and acting are connected. You are both very young. Too young for a permanent relationship especially if you don\u2019t yet know how to deal with the envy creatives can feel.", "YTA. You do not own writing as a hobby, maybe being with you inspired her to take an interest so she is pursuing it. Which is great, you both should use this as a date night idea and have a writing session together! Two heads are better than one and you might even write something amazing together.", "YTA. You sound very judgy and possessive of your own chosen field, as well as more than a bit arrogant to even feel like you have a place to judge her work in the first place. She doesn\u2019t want to show you her work because you\u2019ve already put down the work she\u2019s shown you (and again, what credentials do you have to judge another person\u2019s work???) Of course it\u2019s possible to have multiple areas of focus\u2026how many top-selling authors started out as lawyers, teachers, and other careers? For that matter, shouldn\u2019t an author live a bit before they can truly write good, thoughtful prose? At these of 20, you\u2019re just a baby shark in a great big ocean of giant predators. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to work *with* your girlfriend instead of against her? Support each other, maybe even co-author something? \n\nReading into your post, I think you\u2019re afraid she might be better than you and you don\u2019t like that at all. \n\nPeople who write are writers. Period. You and your girlfriend are *both* writers. You can share the same dream. But  more determined to cut her down than to support her when she opened up to you. And if you can\u2019t support each other, you don\u2019t belong together. She can want to be an actress, an author, a basket weaver or an astronaut, it shouldn\u2019t matter.\n\nSo yes, YTA.", "YTA It sounds like you are jealous and discouraging her. Why can't she study acting and write at the same time?  She's clearly been using her creative side to help you write. People can multi-task, you know...  Also, maybe she didn't tell you she used to write because she hadn't really considered it in a while. Perhaps your writing lit that fire in her again.", "I don\u2019t wanna say you\u2019re the AH mainly because I have felt this similar jealousy before, and because you aren\u2019t an asshole for feeling jealous, your an asshole if you ACT on it", "Henry Winkler: actor and author \nYTA", "YTA - you\u2019re telling her to give up on writing for your own benefit because you\u2019re jealous.

You called her \"surprisingly\" good for a beginner. If she's liked it since childhood and acts, it really shouldn't be that surprising. Not to mention, her acting degree really could go towards writing. Plenty of writers never take professional courses for writing. Here's what happened. Your partner was vulnerable with you about something she was excited about, and you shut her down. You just shut her down because you were insecure. You owe her a massive apology and I wouldn't expect her to share ANYTHING with you for a long time. You hurt her, OP, you hurt the person you claim to care about the most because you wanted to gatekeep writing. \n\nBy the way she's 19, she has more than enough time to figure out what she wants. I'm almost 30 and have entirely shifted gears because I found things that make me happier.\n\nEdit; to add, you seem surprised she hasn't been sharing these things with you. Based on your reaction, should it really be that surprising? She thought you would say something hurtful (though she assumed about her writing, not the act of being happy) and you proved her EXACTLY right.", "YTA. You did not \u201cexpress your truth\u201d to her. You didn\u2019t share that you were surprised that she was so good a writer for a beginner. Or maybe you did as she might have figured out that you really don\u2019t have her best interests at heart. You need to do some significant sole searching and learn from this selfish, insecure move. \n\nI once dated a colleague who was a stronger writer than I was. I took the time to learn from him and while the relationship didn\u2019t last, we remain great friends and my writing is better for it too.
