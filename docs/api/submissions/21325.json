He was my dream guy, handsome, funny, and had a good career as a lawyer. One day we met up to talk per his request and I was\u00a0ecstatic as I thought he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend. However, he explained he thought we should stop seeing each other as we were looking for different things. Me, a husband, and him something casual. He was only staying in my town for a few months to handle his family's business' legal issues\u00a0and then back to work in NY. I was absolutely gutted. \n\nA month later my sister (now 34F) had graduated law school and came home for a few weeks before heading to live in NY. My sister and I had never been close so she had no idea of my heartbreak and I was unaware that she had met my ex while out one day. It wasn't until I heard her talking on the phone with a friend describing a very familiar guy I put it all together. Once I learned this I confronted her and it turned out she had no idea me and him dated. Naturally, she was pissed at him but when confronted it turned out he also had no idea we were sisters since she never talked about our family, we have very different features, and different last names. \n\nAfter finding this out they decided to just get over it since me and him we never really serious. He asked her to be his girlfriend and they decided to continue their relationship in NY. You could just tell by looking at them together they were crazy about each other. Once again, I felt absolutely gutted. This is what our big argument was about. I feel my sister betrayed me and broke girl/sister code by continuing to be with him after everything. She should've had my back whether or not we're close. She felt that I was taking a three week courtship too serious and that I should've given her a pass in this situation as she had no idea. At the time most of the family took my side except for my mom who remained neutral.\n\nYears later now my family only knows what's going on in my sister's life through my mom's updates which my sister allowed. Turns out she married that guy, they have 2 kids together, and are still practicing law in their respective fields. In the latest update we received this weekend it turns out my sister is pregnant again and she told my mom they agreed this is their last one. Once my family heard this they lost their shit. They want to be in her life now, meet her family, and connect with her during this pregnancy since its her last. They want me to apologize for making a big deal out of nothing but I refused. However now I am thinking it over and maybe it's time to get over this entire situation as my sister and my ex did a decade ago.\n\nAm I a asshole after all this time? Was I the asshole to even begin the argument?", "created_utc": 1688475677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qem86/aita_for_holding_a_grudge_against_my_sister_for_a/", "score": 437, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So you think that means your sister you're not even close with should break up with him just because she found out you knew him too.  \n\nYou're too old to still be this jealous of your sister.", "YTA. You and this guy didn't work out 10 years ago over a 3 week fling. It sounds like you're jealous that things did work out with him and your sister and you're taking it out on her. It's not like she starting dating him to spite you, she didn't even know.", "Yta. Three weeks of casual dating and you basically edged your sister out of the family? Get over yourself.", "The only person your grudge has hurt is you.  Your sister has moved on has a great life and family, while you are still nursing a perceived wrong from a decade ago.  Worse yet, you drew your whole family in to take sides over three weeks of dates.  It wasn't a relationship, you weren't his girlfriend.  \n\nFor your own good, let this go.  Leave your sister be.  She's living her best life, while your still stuck in the past.  You're still young enough to grow up and move on.  Stop being bitter.  Start living your life.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nBased on the title I thought you weren\u2019t going to be the ahole. Sister code of not dating each others exes. \n\nBut in this case, she didn\u2019t know. Plus it was very brief what you had with this guy. Why should your sister give up being with, what has turned out to be the love of her life, for you?\n\nYour behaviour has only confirmed to him how glad he is he didn\u2019t choose you. \n\nI can\u2019t believe your family and nieces/nephews have missed out on each other company due to your petty behaviour. Shame on them for allowing it to get so far.", "YTA. \nHe didn't want to be with you and you're still whining about it now. \n\nYOU'RE STILL CHOOSING HIM OVER YOUR SISTER FFS. \n\nYOU should be the one ostracized and alienated 100%. You should be ashamed of this entire situation.", "YTA, you\u2019re not close, and neither of them knew when she met him. They all really had a bond, so why would they drop that for someone their not close with? You had every right to be sad about the situation, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to be mad at either of them.", "YTA: Get over it lady. You dated the guy for 3 weeks. They didn't know they were doing something to \"betray\" you until they had been dating for a while. They obviously love each other. Move on.", "YTA and so is the rest of your family outside of your mom. You blew up your relationship with your sister over a three week long casual hookup. Your sister has been without a support system for 10 years while raising her children because of your pettiness and hurt feelings. Her children don\u2019t know their grandparents because of you\u2026.", "YTA and so are your family members not speaking to your sister.\n\nYou weren\u2019t in a relationship. It was a fling. Your sister and \u2018that man\u2019 did not do anything wrong. You were jealous he didn\u2019t pick you and made your sister lose her family over it. Unbelievable. \n\nI hope your sister is very happy without you.", "YTA\n\nYou need therapy. Neither your sister nor your BIL did anything wrong.", "YTA for being jealous over a simple crush from over a decade ago. Get over yourself instead of being so entitled", "YTA You and your sister weren\u2019t close. SHE had NO idea she was dating a man you had dated. HE had NO idea you were sisters.\nYou have held a grudge, alienated your sister from her extended family, and missed out on knowing her kids for 3 weeks? This is beyond me.\nThere was ZERO malice on their part. \nDid it ever occur to you if he was a lousy guy, he could have strung you along as a long distance? Really sad you wasted so much time and energy, OP.", "YTA - I don\u2019t think \u2018girl code\u2019 applies when she didn\u2019t know and you barely dated. I think you were more of the ah to try and get her to break up with someone who made her happy for the sake of you falling head over heels so quickly for a guy you didn\u2019t know.\n\nI also think it\u2019s incredibly sad that you held a grudge for 10 years over something that you had for all of 5 minutes. You have lost out on having a relationship with your sister and your nieces/nephews, what an incredibly petty and sad life to lead. And still you would almost be willing to carry that on, I would strongly suggest talking to someone about that. You can\u2019t let something so petty affect your life for this long, I truly hope you reach out to your sister and apologise and try to work through this. You are punishing yourself and sacrificing a lovely relationship that you could have with your family. The only one you\u2019ve made suffer is you, your sister is happy, she met the love of her life and has 3 beautiful kids with him, kids that you would rather not have a relationship with because of a 3 week casual relationship that didn\u2019t mean anything. \n\nI really hope you talk to someone about why you let that get the best of you for 10 years.\n\nEdit: grammar", "YTA.  Did you ever stop obsessing over him?  Or throw away the last 10 years being salty?", "YTA. You aren\u2019t his ex. He didn\u2019t like you. He loves your sister. You tore your family apart for a really dumb reason.", "Yta you guy don't even date and you don't close to your sister she never knew about this before.  and you turn the family except mom against her for this. Well maybe if your family members told her they sorry for side with you that time your sister might forgive them without you apology to her.", "You\u2019re that gutted by a three week courtship? I guess slight YTA. Holding a grudge like that is not a great personality trait and can leave you bitter in life.", "YTA. You got your sister shunned from the family because of a 3 week fling that she didn't know about? That's a bit excessive, no? Methinks your BIL was also put off by your intensity. If the tables had been turned, would you have dropped this dream guy for a sister you weren't particularly close to? Only you'd know the answer, but we can guess.", "Omg, make amends already. Show them you've grown and changed and that it's long in the past for you. Otherwise, they know the last decade of your life has been all about them. They did nothing wrong. Nothing. You are being bitter and letting it show. Extend yourself some grace and move on. Sorry, but YTA every which way to Sunday.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey did nothing wrong, you are just removing yourself out of their life - you are fine to do that, but be more polite.", "YTA, and jealous one, 3 weeks and he dumped you, and he meets your sister who even lives in his city wich you don't and not only the are in love (you said so yourself) but they get married and have a family, but your ego is more important, how dare she? What about your 3 week fling? Is the world crazy or what? Let me guess that you are still single if not your partner must be so \"happy\". Wow. The entitlement.", "The fact that OP thinks she's the one that have to forgive her sister is amazing, you cost this girl her family, reading the post none of you went to the weeding nor you know her children, why would she allow your family back in her life? What would she be gaining? A bunch of AH? You can say sorry all you want but why would she forgive you?", "YTA. You caused a huge family rift over your sister dating someone she didn't even know you talked to (not even dated). So much that they got married and had children with no family connection because your familial loyalty suggested that you were wronged. Freaking wow...you still have a grudge? And are upset other family members now want to mend bridges with her after abandoning her for a decade? I think you need some serious help.", "YTA", "I feel sad for you and think you should commit to moving past this. Not for your sister, but for yourself.  A counselor could help you work through your feelings and help you decide how you want to relate to your family for the future. I used to really struggle with jealousy so I get how you can get stuck on a person. Overcoming this trait changed my life immensely.", "YTA\n\nIt was 3 weeks of a casual fling that happened 10 years ago. I wouldn't even call it dating, much less refer to the guy as your ex. So yes, it's well beyond time to get over what happened.", "YTA as is the rest of your family except for your mother.\n\nThe fact that everyone only wants to bury the hatchet because they, selfishly, want to be a part of her pregnancy now that it's their last chance is pathetic.\n\nYou all cut her out of the family for a decade over a three week period of dates?\n\nAnd now you want her to forgive and forget that she was excised from the family because your family wants to be around for her last pregnancy? As if she didn't deserve far better from all of you regardless of her being pregnant or not?\n\nShe was a daughter, sister, niece, cousin etc before she was ever a mom and you let your family throw that all away because of this absurd notion of \"girl/sister code\" which is an entirely made up thing.\n\nNo one betrayed you. No one cheated on you. No one set out to hurt you in any way and you blew your family apart.\n\nTo be honest, I hope she realizes she deserves better than all of you and continues to live her best life and only lets in the people who've always cared about her.", "YTA, as are any relatives who cut your sister off due to your anger. It's fine for you to feel sad, angry, upset,  and so on, but if those feelings lasted more than a couple months, you needed to seek therapy. You admit yourself that your sister and the man entered a relationship honestly and with no knowledge of your prior connection to the guy. Therefore, they didn't betray you or act dishonestly. There is no real \"family doesn't date exes\" rule in general and especially not in this case, in which both partners are \"innocent.\"\n\nYou don't own that man or your sister. You are not entitled to deny your sister a relationship because you're sore about it. \n\nAlso, it sounds like you influenced multiple family members to exclude your sister for many years. How many happy family events did sister and her kids miss out on because of your grudge?\n\nYou're not a victim here, just someone who didn't get what she wanted. I get that it's hard and I sympathize with your sour grapes, but dang! Move on!", "YTA\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t like you and didn\u2019t want to be with you. He let you down easy. He decided he liked the next girl (your sis) better. Clearly you read more into it than he did. Ruining your life over this for ten years is crazy.\n\n\nHave you not dated anyone else? Not seen anyone else?", "YTA\n\nThe way you have treated your sister and your family has treated your sister is really terrible.", "YTA\n\nIf your whole family, other than your mom, cut her off completely then something else happened, you lied to them, you lied to us, or you're lying to yourself.", "Yta for holding such a stupid grudge", "FYI it seems like you've spent approximately 170 times the length of your relationship with the guy being furious that him and your sister hooked up", "YTA\n\nReally need to get over how jealous of your sister you are. Sounds like she moved to NY to get away from a lot of toxicity that stems from you.", "YTA, you can do what you like but this is pretty pathetic on your part.", "YTA. Why should she lose the love of her life because he unwittingly went on a couple of dates with her sister at the time he met her ?  It's not his or her fault that happened nor that he preferred her over you. \n\nShe was right to choose him over you. He has made her happy. You have a very weird sense of ownership over a man you never knew and was never into you. You think you have the right to own people and control them. You don't. \n\nYour family has been very silly to side with you on this.", "Yta.", "You're feelings are valid, and your hurt and heartbreak were valid a decade ago when your very brief relationship ended. Your feelings of betrayal by your sister were valid, even though, as you explain, there was no way either of them could have known what was going on. It's valid to feel however you're feeling. That doesn't mean that what you're feeling is rational, or that your feelings are not misinformed, or that what you choose to do in reaction to how you're feeling is always justified by those feelings.\n\nYou expected your sister to break up with someone she was serious enough about to later marry and have kids with because you and he had a thing for 3 weeks. It's understandable for you to be hurt and upset, to feel betrayed by HIM, for not knowing what he actually wanted or not being confident enough to tell you that he didn't want you, and by her for not breaking up with him in retaliation for his hurting you. You probably felt a lot of feelings, not all of them may have made sense.\n\nIn response to those feelings about the end of a 3 week long relationship, you chose to split your family and not get to meet your niblings. This probably does make YTA.\n\nIt's exciting that you're considering letting your grudge go. It's an opportunity to grow as a person, to meet your sister as an adult, and to meet your niblings. Things might be rocky for a bit, your sister may in turn harbour a grudge against you for the opportunities this last decade has cost her and her family (a big family wedding with you in the bridal party, the whole family at baby showers, birthdays etc). I have every faith that you, your family, your sister and her husband can negotiate the challenges ahead and become better for it.", "I'll go, NAH. It's hard when you feel betrayed by a loved one. And people's feelings can't always be explained or rational. After all this time, I don't believe you should have any ill feelings towards your family that want to be in their lives.  \n\nYour sister didn't intentionally try to hurt you. Nor did your crush. I would suggest therapy to help deal with your negative feelings. And holding the grudge can't be helping any current relationships you have.", "NAH. Your sister didn't know and didn't go out of her way to harm you. You had a right to be upset. That your family wants to reconnect with your sister after years of estrangement isn't wrong and you don't owe anyone an apology if you don't want to reconnect. No one's an asshole here.", "[deleted]", "Info: are you currently in a relationship?", "[deleted]", " YTA, this is sad and funny at the same time", "YTA\nA guy liked your sister more than you.\n\nIts going to happen. It's not anyone's fault.\n\nIt's been years and you've been holding on to this like a crazy person.", "He is not your ex. He is a man you causally dated for THREE WEEKS.. you\u2019re delusional, and the fact that you consider someone who never even called you their gf, your \u201cex\u201d proves it. Get help. Seriously. Seek a professional therapist.", "YTA. No one did this on purpose and you barely knew the guy. I think you should really get some therapy, both for how quickly you \"fell in love\" with someone you didn't know at all, and for your reaction to this situation. This is a long time to hold onto so much bitterness", "YTA to yourself and those poor children.\n\n\"Girl code\" my a$$. More like \"They were perfect for each other and I hate that they're happy because I wanted it.\"\n\nI understand the pain, considering my best friend immediately jumped on my (ex) boyfriend the minute I moved away from town (while we were still dating, before we were exes). He had been the only one to make me happy at the time.\n\nI let that shit go and now I'm happily married with my own kid.\n\nWhat happened to your life? Did you recover and find someone else to hold you? Someone who really loves you and commits to you? Or have you held on to that pain and let it poison your life?\n\nLet the past go in this instance, go be happy, whether single or looking to mingle.", "YTA.  You not only destroyed your relationship with your sister, over a casual three week long affair with some random guy, but you let your jealousy get so far out of control that you got the rest of the family to gang up on her and cut her out of their lives for several years.  \n\nYou not only missed her engagement, wedding, but the births of her 2 children, and since she\u2019s decided to stop having kids after her current pregnancy, NOW you want be a part of her life?!! If I were her, I\u2019d tell you to stay gone.", "YTA \n\nThat\u2019s not your ex \ud83d\ude02, that\u2019s literally some guy you were talking to for three weeks. I suspect your family took your side because you\u2019re quite good at spinning scenarios wherein you are always the one suffering and victimized. \u201cGutted\u201d bffr. I\u2019m happy for your sister and her family, you should be too.", "YTA. It\u2019s not even your ex you guys just knew each other and you had a crush on him 10 years ago.", "I'm really confused how he broke up with her cause she was looking for a husband but then married her sister. Sounds like the complete opposite of what he said. She doesn't have to apologise if she doesn't want to and she doesn't even have to be a part of her life but the fact that she made the whole family cut her sister off makes her the AH. I feel for her sister because yes she knew it would hurt OP but she lost her whole family", "[deleted]", "Can you imagine the guys POV?  He goes on a few dates with a girl and in 3 weeks she\u2019s like, I WANT A HUSBAND\u2026COMMIT TO MEEEEE!!!\n\nNo wonder he ran like Bambi across the meadow.\n\nIt might be different if OP had introduced the guy to her sister.  And certainly if they had been in a committed relationship.  And considering the way the family ostracized the sister, if I was her, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed within a mile of my kids.", "Gentle YTA.  You were involved with this guy for all of 3 weeks, you weren\u2019t compatible. He then found someone who was compatible, unknowingly and awkwardly a blood relative - which I\u2019m sure hurt like heck at the time.\n\nBut it\u2019s 10 years later and it\u2019s time to let the pain and anger go. While you\u2019re chewing over this, you\u2019re missing the opportunity to find your compatible someone - It\u2019s obvious when someone is holding a torch, and it drives interested parties away. No one wants to be number 2 in their partner\u2019s heart. Plus, it\u2019s not healthy for you.", "This was mind boggling YTA", "Exactly this. 3 weeks \u201cdating\u201d is barely dating. \n\nJesus get over yourself already. I also feel for whichever poor bugger is dating/married to OP right now. Imagine living this much in the past.", "[deleted]", "It's not that confusing.  He wanted something casual because he was moving away to NY. So he didn't want to start a relationship with someone and turn it to a long distance relationship. \n\nWith the sister she was also moving to NY so this wasn't a fling because they were both moving to the same place. Making a relationship actually possible.", "....you're confused that someone felt differently about different people at different times? This guy wasn't looking for marriage and didn't want to marry OP. He then met a different woman who he felt differently about.\n\nThis is very basic humanity.", "They never dated.  \n\nTo fit this situation you must say don't date anyone your friend or family member ever liked", "They dated for three weeks. I hardly call that an ex.", "It's possible for people to be grown ups.", "The older sister of a former colleague was like this. She was in her early 30's and would ask the guy 'where he thought this relationship was headed' after a few dates because she didn't want to waste time and cut her losses early (I'm not sure if she told the guys this though). My colleague thought what her sister was doing was OK and she was shocked when a few of us said her sister was scaring off guys by trying to get too serious too quickly.", "Why exactly does the sister need to make amends? She was the one cut off, and for a stupid reason", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any indication the sister wants an apology from OP to begin with, so I don\u2019t really get your point. There\u2019s nothing to say the sister wants to reconcile with her estranged family at all, and I don\u2019t know why they would think she\u2019d forgive any of them for cutting her out of their lives because of a perceived slight to OP.\n\nOP is free to wallow in her misplaced feelings of being betrayed by her sister, who in my opinion did nothing wrong in the first place.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "English is not my first so \"make amends\" wasn't right words probably to get my point across. If you truly care about someone you check up on them even on bad terms and you don't analyze who had the last word who said what who owes apology etc.. I don't say she needs to apologize in any way I say she would at least try to get in touch if she felt any need to reconnect or fix something. \n\nI'm just saying both sisters seem doing fine without each other and OP has right to make her choices as long as she's not going out of her way to hurt somebody. And her family has no right to decide on whether she's bad person/should apologize cause they were in the same boat until recently. It is stupid reason to me or you but to OP is not and forcing out apology or witch hunting her for feeling some type of way has no point and it's ridiculous.", "If I understood correctly family is forcing her to apologize and get in touch?\n\nMisplaced or not she's still not asshole for not wanting to be in contact with somebody. They both live their own lives and if OP fell so hard for the man it may be for the best she removed herself from the situation completely. Real asshole person would try to get man back or find excuses to spend time around married man she had feelings for or knows she can regain those feelings easily. This is pretty much neutral imo I've seen worse lol", "They went on a few dates. That\u2019s not the same as boyfriend/girlfriend dating.", "if the love of your life is someone you dated casually for three weeks ten years ago i suggest therapy.", "They dated for three weeks. She did not mention that they had sex. They might have, but it sounds like she dated someone casually for three weeks and the man did not reciprocate her infatuation.", "Simmer down, child.", "She can't claim to be in-love with him because she does not know him, she's just in-love with the idea of him. She only knew them for 3 weeks, 10 years ago. \n\nShe's probably hurt still because she never learnt to move on.  Getting stuck on someone that doesn't reciprocate your love and obsess over them for 10 years thinking they are  the \"love of your life\", thats mentally unhealthy.", "That makes OP look worse, you know that right?", "If someone has you dated for 3 weeks is the love of your life, you have much much bigger issues than a fight with your sister.", "No, not when you\u2019ve been cut off. OP went out of her way to hurt herself by making a big deal out of sister and guy getting together. \nOP has managed to have the entire family except for mom fully on her side for a decade. Who\u2019s to say sister didn\u2019t try with the extended family? \n\nOP made everything about herself, and cut of support for sister.", "[deleted]", "YTA. 3 weeks is not a relationship. Neither of them did anything to wrong you.", "Yes, YTA. You had a brief fling with a guy, but it wasn't meant to be. Your sister didn't know about your past relationship (such as it was) nor did he, until they were falling in love.\n\nIt is very selfish of you to think your sister should stop seeing Mr Right because the two of you had a brief fling in the past. \n\nGrow up!", "YTA\n\nFor three weeks you were willing to throw a way a family member\u2026 I suggest therapy.", "YTA. Why are still obsessing over your sisters husband? Aren\u2019t there more men out there?", "NAH. I might get downvoted for this, but\n\nLet me start off by saying that though I have never been in a situation like yours, I cannot imagine what it would feel like to be involved with a man who said that I was only good for \u201ccasual dating\u201d and not a \u201cserious\u201d partner, but then turns around, and does a complete 180 for someone else, let alone my sister. \n\nIt sounds like, correct me if I am wrong, but by keeping things \u201ccasual\u201d then that means you two were possibly having sex before he broke it off? I have had something similar happen to me, \u201cdate\u201d \u201ccasual\u201d whatever you want to call it, but then let that person into my body, and thereby my heart, only for them to turn around at the 3 week mark, 2 month mark, and say they are only looking for something \u201ccasual\u201d after I\u2019ve already caught feelings. It\u2019s hurtful, whether this person ended up dating your sister or not, and I am so sorry that you went through that. It is actually one of the reasons why I refuse to commit unless I know for sure that the other person has feelings first, and I also refuse to have sex unless  in a serious, committed relationship (wherein I introduce him to my family and friends, and vice versa, and it is clear that he is just as serious as I am).\n\nThat being said, I do think that you are blocking blessings at this point. You and your sister were never close to begin with, so there is not much missing there, but if the idea of them being together still pisses you off all of these years later, it\u2019s unhealthy. Are you allowed to think back on that time/moment and say, \u201cman what assholes\u201d yes. I used to be bullied in high school and middle school, which resulted in a lot of social awkwardness and lack of social skills in my part later in life. I still think back on people like that, whether they\u2019ve changed or not, \u201cwhat assholes.\u201d I am entitled to my feelings and spent enough class time with then to know that most people are ignorant and apathetic when it comes to other peoples feelings that are not their own friends or family - especially when they never saw anything wrong with it in the first place. And though it\u2019s not the same thing, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to keep letting those peoples words and actions still haunt me in adulthood, so I sought therapy, several therapists, before I found a good one, and have a healthier social life now. \n\nI pose this question to you, OP - is it healthy to look back on that time/moment and say \u201cI am still so angry that the thought of their happiness, and any family member who partakes in their happiness, still boils my blood.\u201d? You have to do what\u2019s best for you, and the sooner you realize that it means moving on, the better. I would encourage you to seek therapy for this. You deserve better than this pain. Don\u2019t allow the dishonest actions of this man - and the inconsiderate actions of your estranged sister - keep you from being and finding your own happiness. Would it be/Is it awkward to have this guy at family functions knowing he rejected you? Yes. I would suggest bringing a friend or significant other if you find yourself in that predicament until/if you feel like you\u2019ll be able to handle it. \n\nNow, if you\u2019ve already moved on, you\u2019ve found someone knew a long time ago, already have children, or you\u2019re happy now in some other way, then I would say Y T A because it sounds like you\u2019d already moved on and it would be more like jealousy at this point.\n\nIf you\u2019d posted 10 years ago when it happened, I would\u2019ve said NTA and the feelings were still fresh. \n\nBut 10 years later, it is definitely your responsibility to take pursuit of happiness into your own hands. I think a lot of people here are hung up on the fact that 3weeks is so little time, but it sounds like you\u2019d developed strong feelings for him, he knew it, and lied to you about why he didn\u2019t want to continue further. You really don\u2019t know someone in 3 weeks, I agree, but I also had to learn this in therapy. My family were the type to diminish my feelings about a crush as a teenager/young adult, and then turn around and be so adamant that they know about every single person I was dating, the why the where if I like them when they can meet them, etc. Dating in college meant readjusting expectations for myself and for other people through therapy. Perhaps you should seek the same. \n\nAnd I am not saying that you had unrealistic expectations for him. No one on this subreddit knows what he told you, how he acted, etc for you to think that he would want to be in a serious relationship. I oftentimes find that men in particular are a bit oblivious when it comes to nonverbal cues around women, and especially if you\u2019d have sex, that may have warped your perception of who/what his intentions were. I find it odd that he chose the 3 week mark, before he was about to leave to go back to NY, the time to say \u201coh yeah this is casual.\u201d Like what even made him bring that up, especially if your read on the situation was \u201coh he\u2019s going to ask me to be his girlfriend yaaay.\u201d So maybe he is the asshole, but after 10 years, NAH for you and your sister. You are no longer a factor in her life (she would sound a little unhinged/bitter if she still held anger toward you and she\u2019s still happy), and she should not be a factor in your life. She is renting condos in your head, rent free, and you don\u2019t deserve that.", "YTA \n\nHe wasn\u2019t into you, didn\u2019t want to be with you. \n\nYour sister by your words is crazy in love with him and he is crazy in love with her.

She didn\u2019t steal your life, the relationship they have is not what you would have had. He didn\u2019t like you like that. You are seriously upset about them being happy?

OP delusions with him are a different story.\n\nI have a brother, and a very close one. It'll be impossible for him to date someone I did without knowing, and since we are close that won't happen. I have a cousin that it's like a brother since he share my brother age, and if he date someone I did without knowing what do you want me to do? Tell him to break up cause I use to date her? It'll be weird depending of the breakup but if he's happy good for him.\n\nAlso, I get the betray of 2 people that meant a lot to you. But one, OP obsession with him barely worth a damn cause that's only on her head, and the sister should respect \"siscode\" just because she's obsessed with the guy when she isn't even that close to her? Bs. In other scenario maybe but in this one na.", "I don\u2019t think you know what that word means. \ud83d\ude2c", "Me too! however, I'm not a psycho so I think it's incredibly wonderful that he has an amazing partner and seems to be very happy in his relationship.", "3 weeks is what... Maybe 6 dates?\n\nThat is so little to get so invested in!", "Ok great, you've yelled from your soapbox about how everyone should be honest and true and give a reach around every single time. Now back to the real world, it absolutely sounds like this guy made up some excuse to let her down easy", "She did NOT love him, she had an infatuation that she allowed to turn into an unhealthy obsession. You can love someone you barely know.", "They knew eachother for 3 weeks and weren't even official, I hardly call that ruining her life.  Are you 12?", "Fiiiiine. Whatever. /s", "If that. We don\u2019t know if they met up every day (unlikely) or only once a week.", "You seem very obsessed over this man's penis potentially being in both of these women. Do you even know if OP and the dude ever got that far in the THREE WEEKS they were hanging out? And for the umpteenth time, they were not dating, they were never official, he never asked her to be his gf.", "The sad part it, it seems like they weren't even dating for months, in the OP, it's mentioned that it was a 3 week fling. She was still waiting for him to ask her to be his gf.", "That\u2019s what it sounds like but AGAIN you are both projecting\u2026 It LITERALLY SAYS that the dude and the sister moved to NY and are BOTH lawyers so it\u2019s super likely that they\u2019d have met.\n\nIt even says that the sister was upset and confronted the dude\u2026 It might be a strange concept to you, but people definitely do just tell the truth and are honest.", "But the post never says they met in NY, just that sister met him when she was out one day.\n\nIt sounds like they met in hometown and decided to *continue* the relationship in NY \u2014 because the feelings were real.\n\nBut it wasn't true that he was only looking for a casual relationship. Just that he didn't see himself headed for marriage with OP.", "Yeah i don't know why you're emphasizing points that aren't in contention. Yes, he moved to New York. No, he made no attempt at continuing long distance or suggesting she follow him. He saw a super easy out and took it, it doesn't mean that he was never going to NY. It was just a convenient parachute", "It also never says the met in hometown either. But it does say that the sister came home for a few weeks before going back to LIVE in NY. Not before MOVING to NY. \n\nSo it\u2019s safer to assume that since they\u2019re both lawyers with interests of moving to NY that they met doing lawyer stuff in NY. \n\nAnd it could be true that he wanted something casual, but surprise surprise! Humans change! It makes complete sense that if he knew he was only in town for a few months and single, he\u2019s gonna date casually. But he was planning on moving and actually being  in NY so things can easily change if he met someone in NY.\n\nSame thing I told another commenter\u2026 \n\nIt was 3 weeks, so he would be literally UNHINGED if he asked OP to uproot her life for him after 3 weeks.\n\nAnd he\u2019s a grown ass man who\u2019s attractive and a lawyer\u2026. He\u2019s NOT doing long distance when he can just find someone where he lives\u2026", "There is no way they just happened to meet op\u2019s family probably introduce them to each other", "Why would he try long distance?? It was 3 weeks.\n\nWhy would he ask her to follow him, it was 3 weeks.\n\nYou\u2019re also missing a VERY important detail\u2026\n\nHe started the conversation by saying that he wants to call off the relationship because they were after different things, OP a husband, him something casual.. Dude started the conversation and LED with that. So again, you guys can go project elsewhere, This dude did what he was supposed to do, and communicated what he was feeling.."]}
