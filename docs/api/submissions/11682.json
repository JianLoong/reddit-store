People with allergies don't wear neon lights or big signage, so there's no way that the guy with the dog knew it would be safe.", "It's unhygienic and incredibly unfair to those with allergies. Also people are trying to have a quiet, enjoyable meal and don't need some barking, shitting, slobbering dog around to ruin things (for the same reason people don't like dining around loud/crying children). The most intolerant people nowadays are dog nutters who assume everyone is going to give their personality replacement attention in public, and allow them to act up and leave shit everywhere.", "In my country I don't experience this problem, many restaurants allow dogs and people enjoy it... It seems so intolerant to think dogs shouldn't ever be in family environments like cafes, restaurants etc... In my country there are so many places which do allow dogs. Part of going out in public is dealing with things that annoy you but you should still be tolerant of others (including different animals, different types of people etc.) If somebody is annoyed by children or dogs, it's their own problem and they should stay at home instead of complain about others (kids/dogs etc) daring to be in public.", "With how crazy some people seem to become, I don't blame an employee for not wanting to say anything; who wants to get assaulted for minimum wage?! However, businesses, by not knowing or enforcing, the laws on service animals have created an environment that entitled people exploit to the detriment of trained service animals and people who rely on them."]}
