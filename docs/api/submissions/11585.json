I went to visit my mom and see my siblings. Her husband refuses to help clean and pawns it all off on my siblings! He never helps my mother with anything!

He demands that I wash dishes and clean up their bathroom. I tell him no because I don\u2019t live here and I\u2019m here as a visitor! He got angry and told me I wasn\u2019t welcome back!

Your mom needs to run with your sibs. You did not go too far. Your mom is not his mom. Women are not servants of men.", "NTA. Stop visiting mom at her home. Try a park or take her out for lunch. Her husband can do his own cleaning. Feel sorry for your mom but it's not your job.", "NTA - he's stuck in some 50's wet dream like Pleasantville", "Hi! Definitely NTA I'd say. \n\nLike you said, you don't live there. It's a different story if he or your mom would have asked you for a favor, but not like this. Good job for standing up for yourself, your mom and your siblings!", "Nta your step dad is stuck in the 50\u2019s and needs to man up and help.

It would be *nice* of you to -maybe-help her with a little chore, here and there. But *demanding* you wash the dirty dishes and clean the bathroom?

Your mother's husband is feeling entitled to cleaning services from her children, even the ones who no longer live in the home. Personally, I wouldn't share my home with a moocher and freeloader like that, but then again, different strokes for different folks. At any rate to suggest that you should be picking up after this person is absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA. Told by who? Do you even have to ask?", "NTA.  I\u2019d have said no- and then ignored him.

Why in the world would it be your responsibility to clean his house??", "Who told you, you went too far?", "NTA", "NTA - this is not your problem. Husband is the AH for expecting you to help.
