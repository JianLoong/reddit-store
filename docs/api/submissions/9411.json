Stepdaughter asks for chocolate as a snack. She tried to sneak off with a bag full of chocolate coins but as I saw this I told her to ask my spouse if she could have all of that at once (she tends to overeat sweets if not supervised). She went back to the kitchen and was told she can have 3 coins. So stepdaughter opened the pouch and dropped a coin.

My sister had a dog that went into kidney failure because of grapes. Chocolate is obviously very bad for dogs. This isn\u2019t something that you can gently talk about multiple times. She needs to understand being careless can kill the dog. If it was me, I probably wouldn\u2019t buy either grapes or chocolate for the house for the next year or two until you\u2019re sure she\u2019s more responsible. She is 10 years old and 10 year olds tend to not always be responsible, very normal, but she\u2019s old enough to have consequences for this kind of careless behavior.", "YTA. Th\u00e9 leave it command can be difficult to teach some dogs. If that\u2019s the case, you should work with a trainer who can teach you how to effectively teach your dog to leave it. You have a child and dog in the same home\u2026I don\u2019t understand how that command wasn\u2019t one of the first you taught the dog. Your lack of that responsibility is not your stepdaughters fault.", "YTA. Yes she should be more careful, but you also need to train your dog. Why is he allowed in the kitchen if he\u2019s going to eat food as soon as it\u2019s dropped? Chocolate coins falling on the ground should not be an emergency because the dog should know better than to scarf them down.", "YTA- it\u2019s safer for the dog to teach it \u201cleave it\u201d. I have 5 dogs and two kids at home. Shit gets dropped. The dogs will literally look at me if something gets dropped waiting for permission. Three of them just turned a year old and have done this for months, so your dog is not too young to learn \u201cleave it\u201d. Next you\u2019ll be having a massive coronary because your dog bum rushes the door every time it\u2019s opened but instead of teaching it to \u201cstay\u201d you\u2019ll scream at the poor step child because she was going outside to play and the dog ran her over to get out.", "NAH, but please be sure to communicate to your step-daughter that you aren't mad at her, you're worried about the dog. Don't let this build into resentment towards her and also don't let her think that you hate her. I know this may sound overdramatic, but as a girl who was diagnosed with ADHD at 16, a lot of my childhood was spent with adults getting mad at symptoms I could not control and me thinking I was broken and unfixable, even if the actual situations made sense to be mad at.\n\nIf she does have ADHD and these are all just accidents, remember that it's propably a lot harder for her than it seems like. ADHD can really, really mess with your ability to remember doing even the simplest things, no matter how many times you've been told them. Still, she should not be putting the dog in danger. Explain this to her. Apologize for shouting but also make sure she understands that her being absentminded about this particual topic can be seriously dangerous and ask her to be really careful in the future. She should be old enough to understand and try harder, but she's also young enough to get really scared of your shouting and her own inability to focus.\n\nI hope this makes some amount of sense, I'm not sying you are the AH at all, just providing some perspective from someone who used to be the kid here.", "I'm going to give your stepdaughter the benefit of the doubt here.  I'm guessing she's not dropping things on purpose.  And no doubt she does so out of nervousness when you're around.\n\nHave you and your wife and stepdaughter discussed a plan to keep this from happening again?  Talked about exactly which foods can and can't be around the dog, and figured out how to take steps to keep the dog safe?  This gives all of you something to refer to when the inevitable issues show up.  I understand your frustration.  But having a plan in place seems a lot more productive than yelling at a 10 year old with ADHD for being a 10 year old with ADHD.  \n\nWhat I don't get is the fact that you obviously haven't trained your dog not to scarf up food from the floor.  This is Dog Training 101, especially if you ever plan to take your pup anywhere.  Your stepdaughter isn't the only one to drop food, certainly?  Accidents happen.  Your dog should have been trained long before this.  I have to go with YTA.", "YTA, it's on you as the adult to train your dog appropriately AND serve your stepdaughter in a setting that will not lead to this problem. The grape issue was an expensive lesson that you didn't learn from.", "If you know your dog is prone to stealing dropped food you should be taking precautions like baby gating food areas or not buying the items FFS, it\u2019s not your stepdaughters fault the dog can\u2019t control itself. Not screaming at children for something they PHYSICALLY cannot help. Her mind and limbs already don\u2019t work like they\u2019re supposed to, you\u2019re only going to make her feel bad about herself.

I get that, but accidents happen. I drop stuff all the time. My dog knows if a say \u201cstop\u201d in a certain tone then she needs to back off. That\u2019s a skill your dog needs to have. That said, my lab is a determined garbage disposal and has straight up eaten an entire (sealed) box of Halloween candy that was up on a counter. Didn\u2019t so much as have diarrhea. Your dog would have been fine even if it had gotten a couple coins. As long as your stepdaughter wasn\u2019t just like \u201coh well\u201d and actually went to pick them up she didn\u2019t deserve to be screamed at for an accident. Some kids are clumsy and uncoordinated, she wasn\u2019t being malicious.", "YTA.  Why hasn't your dog been trained not to eat off the floor?", "Hold on.\n\nYou are punishing a child for accidentally dropping things, but you're not training the dog not to jump at everything that lands on the floor?\n\nYTA", "YTA- kids make mistakes. She wasn\u2019t purposely giving harmful items to your dog. You need to teach your dog \u201cleave it\u201d ASAP so you don\u2019t have to worry so much about this happening.", "YTA. There was no reason to yell at stepdaughter for dropping something. What needs to happen is a plan to prevent further accidents. Anything that could hurt the dog should be dished out by you or your wife to your stepdaughter. You've listed 2 occurrences that were clearly accidents. Your stepdaughter got nervous when her mother blamed her for dropping the chocolate when it should have been given to her by one of you. Your yelling will not change anything but to make her more nervous around the dog. Perhaps you should also work on training your dog to sit on command and prevent him from getting over excited.", "YTA.\n\nWhy in the world have you not trained the dog \u201cleave it\u201d??

Train your dog not to go after everything that drops.", "INFO: Aside from the listed incidents, how often does she drop food the dog can't have? Or drop anything else?

How does your husband feel about his daughter's dropping things/your reaction?", "YTA. Train your dog, or keep a gated area where the child eats. Jesus, just do a little critical thinking. Also, that dog would have to eat a shitload of milk chocolate to have any issues...like 3.5 full-sized chocolate bars for a 40lb. dog for even mild symptoms. Relax and maybe STOP buying toxic stuff if you're going to spaz out on a little kid.", "YTA \n\nYou do not punish children for accidents. \n\nMy youngest kid is exceptionally clumsy. Turns out, he has a medical condition that is playing a big role. If your child is dropping things more than what is \"normal\", you don't punish them - you get them evaluated by a Dr. \n\nAnd train your dog.", "YTA\nTeach your dog not to eat unless told.\nIt's safer for your dog and probably one of the first things you should teach.\nYour dog shouldn't just pick up anything to eat it's dangerous", "YTA - she's a child and it was an accident.", "First of all, one grape is not enough to kill a dog of that size. It\u2019s just not. I think you\u2019re already aware of this and that the point of driving to the vet with your stepdaughter as a witness to it was more about making her feel guilty and worried and less about saving your dog\u2019s life. I think you did that to be able to hold it over her head. Either that or you really were somehow under the impression that one grape can kill a dog of that size which is pretty silly. Something tells me it\u2019s the former.\n\nSounds like you\u2019re not giving us the full truth about the nature and content of your reaction. And if what you\u2019re saying is the full representation, you\u2019re the adult, she\u2019s a child. It\u2019s her job to be 10 years old and it\u2019s your job to not freak out about dropping a grape. Get creative about how and when to keep the snacks that aren\u2019t healthy for your dog away from your dog.", "YTA, She was dropping food by accident she wasn\u2019t doing to deliberately harm your dog. You need to teach your dog to not to eat certain foods that are bad for him. People with ADHD especially kids are more sensitive to criticism and are more clumsy and you should know that by now. Pets need to be disciplined when necessary not just kids", "Yta. If you can\u2019t train your dog then consider crating him while children are eating. I have to do this with my scavenger beagle who inhales literally everything.", "YTA who screams at a kid for dropping some food, maybe train your dog not to eat things off the floor or have better recall or even keep the damn dog away from somebody who is eating/preparing food", "YTA, your dog is a year and a half and is old enough to be trained not to eat dropped food without permission.\n\nA 10 year old dropping things on accident isn't something you can train out of them.", "YTA. Everyone drops things from time to time. Especially ten year olds. You overreacted", "YTA. Why in the world haven\u2019t you trained your dog to stop eating shit off the floor???", "YTA\n\nTrain your dog to stay out of the kitchen, or get doggy gates.

I\u2019m a grown ass adult and I drop things that my dog wants to eat literally all the time. Last week she ate a chapstick, plastic and all. 2 incidents is not \u201ca lot of close calls\u201d. She\u2019s ten. Her fine motor control is still developing. \n\nGet some peroxide. It\u2019s a helluva lot cheaper to induce emesis at home, and pretty damn easy too. A tablespoon would do the trick for an average sized retriever.\n\nAnd really? A vet visit for one grape? The last time I had to induce emesis in my dog was because I spilled some aleve on the ground, and I still managed to take care of my dog without flipping my shit.", "YTA, children make mistakes, they have acciendents.  Train your dog not to eat everything, and anything unsafe for the dog should only be handed out by you or your husband. Being clumsy is a common part of ADHD, you screaming at her for an accident is only going to make her afraid to try and fail, so she'll stop trying anything. Look up RSD in ADHD", "YTA.  If accidents have consequences, deliberate actions have more severe consequences.   I really doubt you feel bad for the kid.", "YTA - I have a kid and dogs. To start 1 grape will not kill a lab. Yelling at a kid for being a kid is insane. Teach the dog \"leave it\". Shit will happen all the time. Mistakes happen. Get off your high horse and teach the dog.

Imagine being antagonized over a stepmother counting our your chocolates and ratting you out to the biological father (classy move), and then being screamed at about the damn dog.

Train your dog.", "NAH. You knee jerk reacted for the safety of the dog. I just want to make you aware that poor motor coordination is also a symptom of ADHD. It makes it very common for those affected to drop things, bump into things, knock things over, trip and fall, and all sorts of other klutzy things that we usually grow out of at a young age. Cut the girl some slack and get her officially diagnosed so she can be treated (pediatric occupational therapy is an awesome way to go), then teach your dog the \u201cleave it\u201d command. Goldens are smart and obedient dogs, even at a young age. You guys can figure this out.", "YTA", "NAH\n\nPlease just stop buying grapes, rasins, or chocolate for the next year or two.

It can be as simple as putting a treat on the floor (that dog can have) and teaching dog \u201cleave it\u201d then giving the treat as a reward. You eventually get to the stage that if something is accidentally dropped you should be able to tell dog \u201cleave it\u201d and it won\u2019t go for it.", "Your behavior was inappropriate. It sounds like you were overstimulated and lashed out. That can be harmful for a child. You need to apologize and explain what happened and let the child know in no uncertain terms that she is not responsible for how you reacted and that you are not excused from treating those around you with respect and compassion. You are not allowed to say \u201cI reacted this way because you\u2026\u201d. Explain but do not make excuses. You are human and she needs to see that and know that you are sorry and that you love and respect her.", "YTA for reposting this.", "NTA, but you should stop making foods available to the girl which aren't good for the dog.   \n\nBut just an FYI on chocolate, the typical chocolate a child gets is milk chocolate, mostly milk and sugar with almost no actual chocolate.  It would take the dog eating over 1 pound of it before your dog would be in serious trouble.

That said, maybe you over reacted in that moment, as you were able to get the chocolate away from the dog and then you scared the kid. I think you owe SD an apology and an explanation for your reaction.

Most cats will not readily eat grapes or raisins, reducing the risk.\u00a0 However, if consumed, they are at risk (Dijkman et al 2022). In this study, approximately 15% of animals ingesting grapes or raisins developed clinical signs such as vomiting, anorexia and restlessness, whereas only 1/95 dogs (and no cats)\u00a0developed AKI.\u00a0 However, many of the animals had emesis induced shortly after observed ingestion, which might have reduced the true incidence of AKI. Another study that included 606 dogs that were presented to emergency clinics after ingestion found that likelihood of clinical signs (vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, abdominal distension) increased with increasing time between exposure and intervention (Croft et al 2021).\u00a0 Of the 38 dogs presenting more than 12 hours after ingestion, 25 (66%) showed clinical signs.\u00a0 Only one of 33 dogs that had multiple creatinine concentrations assessed showed evidence of mild AKI.\u00a0 However, as with the other study, most dogs underwent interventions such as induced emesis or fluid therapy.\u00a0 A third study (Reich et al 2021) found an overall AKI incidence of 7%, with the incidence increasing with delayed presentation.\u00a0 Therefore, the true likelihood of developing AKI after ingestion is unknown, because in most studies, investigators instituted interventions that might have decreased the probability of developing AKI. However, smaller amounts could also cause problems - we really don't know exactly what the minimum dose is. Also, not every dog or cat is susceptible - many animals can tolerate large quantities of grapes or raisins without problems. Nobody knows what the patient risk factors are (other than ingestion). Treatment for acute ingestion (e.g. emesis, activated charcoal) followed by diuresis at twice maintenance for 36-72 hours should be instituted for observed acute ingestion. Renal function should be monitored for several days. If there is no renal damage after 3 days, the animal will likely remain unaffected.\u201d", "1. OP never said the dog didn\u2019t exhibit these symptoms or said if the dog is otherwise healthy. Just because the dog is young doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t have preexisting conditions.\n2. This means that even per the hospital you called it is POSSIBLE for a single grape to cause the symptoms and ultimately lead to death. \n3. A single grape can cause lethal toxicity even in a health dog that size", "Hehe yes it\u2019s better than nothing. Vets can\u2019t make recommendations online for treatments or drug doses, especially without seeing the animal, but usually you\u2019d want to give something like Famotidine or Omeprazole after to reduce the acidity in the stomach and hopefully acid reflux won\u2019t be as damaging. Pumpkin/oatmeal/rice are good bland foods. I don\u2019t actually know if sucralfate is OTC off the top of my head, but that\u2019s also helpful as a GI protectant\n\nEdit: also hydrogen peroxide is only effective if it\u2019s within a short time frame of the dog eating something it shouldn\u2019t. It shouldn\u2019t be given if a dog ingested a chemical unless you call poison control first to find out if they interact with each other negatively. Clinics who used to give peroxide would follow it up with activated charcoal, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something people have on hand in a large enough quantity\n\nEdit 2: Milk! Milk can also be a GI protectant", "Because it really highlights how troubled you are as an individual.
