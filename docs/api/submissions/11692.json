She didn\u2019t go on many family holidays as a child and as a result says that she sees holidays as a luxury rather than a necessity. \n\nMy wife and I are expecting our first child. We\u2019re both very happy about this but, at the same time, it\u2019s a massive change to our lives. We are both working, she works in an office and I work as an engineer. \n\nI\u2019ve been finding my job quite stressful of late and have had a few things happen in my personal life that have been upsetting. I told my wife that I was considering taking some time off work and going on holiday somewhere. As my wife is 29 weeks pregnant, she would be unable to fly, so I said that I would go alone. She offered an alternative of staying in our country for a break away together but the country we live in is notoriously expensive to holiday in, I would rather spend the same amount of money on a sunny holiday. She asked if I thought that was fair and I responded that I needed the holiday more than she did. She got very upset about this and told me I was being selfish. I don\u2019t think I am being selfish as she doesn\u2019t view holidays as essential and this will likely be my last opportunity to go somewhere sunny for a few years with the baby on the way.\n\nAITA for needing a holiday?", "created_utc": 1678183210, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kv300/aita_for_wanting_to_go_on_holiday_without_my_wife/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t leave your wife and go somewhere that if something happened, your child would be born in a hospital that could handle it. Babymoons have become more popular because the expectant parents understand this is their last chance to rest for a while, and unless you plan to bottle feed and fully take on 50% of the work (not even counting the difficulty in sleeping or labor and delivery) your wife will be much more tired than you. \n\nPlus hate to tell you, holidays were you travel to other countries ARE a luxury. YTA", "My worst mental health period was when I convinced myself (and was told by everybody around me) that I could not afford a holiday and didn\u2019t take any. \n\nTurns out that being away from my home with all the things I should do and haven\u2019t done, and being in new surroundings with no responsibilities other than filling my brain with new impressions is important maintenance for my brain. \n\nFrom time to time I need to reset the deep relaxation button in my brain. \n\nOP is an ass for \u2018needing\u2019 to go out of the country an at this point in time, but _needing a holiday_ is something I can attest to. Only I met my needs with a tent 50k from home.", "I wish them both a lot of fun.", "Not at all.", "Right, which is why I didn't include the word \"abroad\" in my response.", "My husband was on a hunting trip with his dad about an hour and a half away when I was 38 weeks pregnant, which made him uneasy but I had to be induced with my first two so I didn't think he needed to worry. I ended up going into labor luckily when my husband reached service at his camp site.\nHe got home, we settled our other two kids at the in laws house, and 30 minutes later had our son! Never had my labors gone that quickly, and I know how incredibly lucky we got that it all timed out okay.\n\nI couldn't imagine him wanting to fly States away for a vacation while I was miserably pregnant and alone. That would have had me reevaluating not just the marriage, but how would he be as a father if he's going to be putting his needs and wants first?", "Exactly. Or, if by some miracle he can still afford holidays, he should also be prepared to bring his family with him. But yeah. Regardless he\u2019s still not going to be able to escape his duty as a father.", "Nah, OP will still go on them without his wife and child, and I bet he will get loads of sleep.", "Pregnant women can't fly after ~28-30 weeks (exact weeks depending on airlines t&c). Quite few airlines also require doctors note clearing pregnant woman to fly after ~24 weeks. I had to have one when flying at 27 weeks to visit family.", "OP is saying he specifically needs a holiday abroad. He rejected his wife's suggestion that they holiday together in their own country.", "That's not true. Airline dependent, they can *ask* for a doctors note from 24 weeks. That doesn't mean she CAN'T fly though, it means she needs a note. \n\nI've attached NHS and British Airways guidance for reference. \n\n[https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/travelling/](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/travelling/) \n\n[https://www.britishairways.com/cms/global/pdfs/ba\\_travel\\_trade/bmi\\_policies/children/bmi\\_expectant\\_mothers.pdf](https://www.britishairways.com/cms/global/pdfs/ba_travel_trade/bmi_policies/children/bmi_expectant_mothers.pdf)", "I've flown at 34 weeks. No doctors note. I plan to fly at 32 and 33 weeks this pregnancy. No reason to think I couldn't.", "No, he just said he preferred to spend the same money abroad that a holiday in country would cost. He never said he needs the holiday abroad.\n\n>I would rather spend the same amount of money on a sunny holiday.\n\nThat's the part that makes him the AH - not needing a holiday, but valuing his \"sunny holiday\" higher than his wife's need to have a holiday herself.", "Yes, I read that. I'm just not really clear why you are choosing to take issue with how I've worded my response.  \n\n\nI've clearly stated I am not in agreement with him taking a holiday outside the country. I've clearly stated that feeling like he needs a vacation doesn't make him the AH. I've clearly stated that he is still the AH in this situation.  \n\n\nWhat exactly is it that you have a problem with?", "It specifically said it might take weeks to get the note. She's 29 weeks now, if it takes weeks, it will be too late. I also can't imagine flying that pregnant. I developed complications in the third trimester in both of my pregnancies. The only way you would get me on a plane at that point is if it was life or death", "And they can refuse entry without note same as refusing entry without inhaler for asthmatic.\nAlso in UK (where i am btw) not many people fly with BA for holidays. Most people uses Ryanair or Easyjet or Wizzair. \nPlus you have to have healthy blood pressure for midwife/go to issue note.", "In the comments he's arguing that he neeeeeeeds a holiday abroad because he always had them growing up \ud83d\ude44", "The judgement you have given is NTA...", "I flew to a different state for Christmas when I was 32 weeks pregnant with my son. I also was traveling with just my 2 daughters who were 6 and 3 at that point. My husband met us there.", "On the **NHS** yes. But private notes can be obtained within 24 hours. You pay for the note regardless, so most people would just see a private doctor to get the note.\n\nFor those not in the UK, the NHS is free, but *very slow* to get anything non-urgent.", "Honestly flying while that far along sounds super uncomfortable. I feel uncomfortable in airplane seats now (5 ft 4 in at 156 lbs) and based on my measurements I couldn\u2019t imagine how uncomfortable people taller or heavier than me feel.", "Wait, where can you be refused entry if you don't have an inhaler? I'm asthmatic too, and have never heard of that before! Do you have an NHS link?", "The only comment in that direction I could find was this:\n\n>I accept that I phrased that incorrectly. I have always been accustomed to yearly holidays where as she isn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t bother her to not go on a sun holiday every year but it does bother me.\n\nAnd that's still not saying he \"needs\" it, just that it bothers him not to go. Which is fair enough - he's not the AH for wanting something, just for putting his wants ahead of his wife's needs.", ">NTA for needing a holiday but still YTA.\n\nRead it again maybe?", "As a midwife I gave a woman a letter to fly when she turned up, without an appointment, in my clinic last Friday at 5.30pm. She was flying at 6.00am the next day. This is not ideal but women see their midwife frequently throughout pregnancy and we are not usually slow to help out with this kind of thing.", "Maybe she has a risk that would prevent flying.  Maybe she is nervous.  I assure you when I was 24 weeks pregnant, I wouldn't be getting on a flight.", "The first judgement you give is the one that's counted, though. So NTA.", "Actually, if two judgements are given, neither counts. So this comment isn't being counted as a judgement anyway.", "I've looked through all the rules and found nothing stating anything like this \"first judgement counted\". I don't see it in the sub rules, how to post or the FAQ.  \n\n\nCan you show me where this is located?", "I stand corrected!", "It used to be the case, but apparently now two judgements mean the post isn't counted towards the judgement at all \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f My apologies."]}
