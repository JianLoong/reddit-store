What will you do if he demands a shift change? Or changes jobs? Will you follow him?\n\nYou seriously need to evaluate your trust in him here, whether it\u2019s rationally based or not.

Couples counseling comes to mind.  \n\nAlso, working with a spouse or S/O- NEVER shit where you eat.", "YTA and a stalker.

If you're that distrustful of him, you should have divorced him already instead of playing out a telenovela drama.   \n\n\nAssuming he wasn't cheating with his co-worker (because you clearly don't know that for a fact beyond just being \"concerned\"), he certainly won't trust you in turn now.

YOU decided to forgive him. Now YOU have trust issues and decided it was a good idea to get a job where he works without telling him. I find it funny that you found his reaction \"so over the top\"..... You just told your husband that you don't trust him and embarrassed him in front of every single coworker he has. It's one thing to not trust him because he cheated.

You (and your husband) need the appropriate counseling and you need to decide whether you trust him and can move on or to end the relationship. What are you going to go in the future? Every time he has a female colleague that he's friendly with are you going to go and work there too?\n\nHe's quite possibly doing it again which obviously would be ESH but we don't know that for sure. what we do know for sure is that getting a job to watch him is not the solution.", "ESH.

But getting a job there without telling him is a bit too far. But you should have left after he cheated before.", "YTA\n\nGetting a job there just to spy on your husband at work is what some psycho in a movie would do.", "YTA for all the reasons already listed - however, I think he's pissed because he's up to no good.  Especially if that coworker was pissy to you, when she shouldn't care either way.", "yta and holy insecure batman. like you have issues", "YTA and the uneasiness you feel is kind of what you get for staying with someone who cheated on you before. Infidelity is the best reason to end a marriage (right after abuse), and you should've just done that a long time ago.", "YTA. Your actions are not healthy and are not going to take your relationship anywhere good.", "What you did was creepy.\n\nYTA", "NTA. You're right not to trust him.", "NTA- I would say since infidelity has been an issue in the past, in order to make your marriage work his right to privacy has shifted a bit. As his wife, you should have every right to question him especially if similar signs are being shown that were there when he was being unfaithful to you. People who break your trust don't just get to have it back without earning it. In fact the fact that he's mentioning her to you in the first place sounds like maybe some reverse manipulation. Like, \"Oh, if I tell her how nice this girl is and that we hang out on break then she won't suspect anything because if I was cheating why would I mention her at all?\" Classic. But no, you're smarter than that. So you got a job where he works and you didn't tell him which is genius. Because if you had told him then he would've had an opportunity to warn this girl not to act any kind of way towards him and his coworkers not to say anything. Instead you caught him off guard. Now he's just pissed that you came in and ruined it all or \"embarrassed\" him or something. Well tough shit. And then he doesn't talk to you? Your husband? What a real man should do especially if they have been unfaithful in the past is consistently have no problem with your questioning and concerns for a loooooong time. He completely broke your trust and he has to earn it back. Trust is the foundation of a relationship. Without trust there is no relationship. He doesn't just get to be trusted working with a girl and going on break with her. To fix your marriage, he should stay away from women for a while period. Or at least validate you, respect you and where you're coming from. The moment he started this job and noticed you getting paranoid he should have said something like, \"Honey, I promise you have nothing to worry about. But if you are worried, you have every right to meet this girl, look at my phone, whatever you need to do to trust me.\" If he's not hiding anything  he should have no problem with that. You are his wife. Anyone who says differently does not understand marriage and how it works. He can't keep you and continue to do whatever the fuck he wants to do. He lost that privilege where he abandoned your trust, your PROMISE to remain faithful to each other.", "NTA seems like he cheating and mad  his work romance is done. You can get a job anywhere you want to.", "If her marriage is so bad that she has to get a job at his workplace to keep an eye on him there is no marriage to save.", "Could you imagine being a coworker of theirs!!! You find out one coworker is a cheater.... And his wife is a stalker. Worst part is, OP isn't even embarrassed by her actions.", "Forreal... he was def trying to cheat and she's def oot", "Actually, she should have divorced him when she caught him cheating.", "She doesn't.
