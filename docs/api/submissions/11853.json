You're right not to trust him.", "NTA- I would say since infidelity has been an issue in the past, in order to make your marriage work his right to privacy has shifted a bit. As his wife, you should have every right to question him especially if similar signs are being shown that were there when he was being unfaithful to you. People who break your trust don't just get to have it back without earning it. In fact the fact that he's mentioning her to you in the first place sounds like maybe some reverse manipulation. Like, \"Oh, if I tell her how nice this girl is and that we hang out on break then she won't suspect anything because if I was cheating why would I mention her at all?\" Classic. But no, you're smarter than that. So you got a job where he works and you didn't tell him which is genius. Because if you had told him then he would've had an opportunity to warn this girl not to act any kind of way towards him and his coworkers not to say anything. Instead you caught him off guard. Now he's just pissed that you came in and ruined it all or \"embarrassed\" him or something. Well tough shit. And then he doesn't talk to you? Your husband? What a real man should do especially if they have been unfaithful in the past is consistently have no problem with your questioning and concerns for a loooooong time. He completely broke your trust and he has to earn it back. Trust is the foundation of a relationship. Without trust there is no relationship. He doesn't just get to be trusted working with a girl and going on break with her. To fix your marriage, he should stay away from women for a while period. Or at least validate you, respect you and where you're coming from. The moment he started this job and noticed you getting paranoid he should have said something like, \"Honey, I promise you have nothing to worry about. But if you are worried, you have every right to meet this girl, look at my phone, whatever you need to do to trust me.\" If he's not hiding anything  he should have no problem with that. You are his wife. Anyone who says differently does not understand marriage and how it works. He can't keep you and continue to do whatever the fuck he wants to do.
