In fact, it's a very good idea to no longer be in business with someone who left you at the altar.", "NTA. But don't short change yourself and sell too low just to get out. Especially if you aren't involved in day to day operations that would force you to interact with her. But if you have a good offer, take it.", "INFO:\n\nEmotionally, it's probably a good idea for you not to be working together and I can see the appeal of detaching yourself as soon as possible. \n\nFinancially, it depends on the nature of your business: is it saleable right now? Does it rely on your or her personal knowledge/expertise/experience? Are there any buyers out there right now in a difficult world market? Could you buy her out rather than sell to a stranger? Or can she buy you out?\n\nFrankly, I would be very careful about making an emotional response to your business so quickly. Maybe use/have an intermediary at all meetings, try to hold those meetings on neutral ground, etc etc. Presumably you went into this business venture bc you believed in it; don't be too quick to throw away your involvement unless that's the right thing **for you** longer term.", "Sell your share of the business, and tell her she has  to pay you for your half of the honeymoon.\n\nSince she didn't even give you the choice to go.\n\nNTA everything that happens now is on her and her fault.\n\nI'm sorry she did that to you, no one deserves going through that.", "NTA. How awful! I can\u2019t even imagine how you\u2019re feeling right now. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019d definitely sell.

Not only should you sell your half of the business, you should get your ring back and sell it.  \n\nRemember that the best revenge is leading a good happy life. And just think of how other men are going to regard her. Who wants a fiancee who has seen too many \" Runaway Bride\" type movies?", "NTA, absolutely not, she ended your relationship and you are perfectly within your rights to get rid of things that remind you of her, be it an old Tshirt or a joint business venture.", "NTA \n\nSell off your share of the business and ensure that you don\u2019t get ripped off in the process. You should get a proper share of profits made so far", "Hi OP, you're NTA, and sorry you were humiliated like that. I'd consult an attorney or financial advisor if necessary to be certain you'll get the best deal and aren't making any paperwork mistakes.  Get out, or buy her out. Best of luck to you.", "NTA. Why on Earth would you feel beholden to keep the shares to someone who publicly embarrassed you and left you at the alter?", "NTA, if you are financially secure enough to sell your share, then I encourage you to. She left you at the altar and didn't even show up on time on top of that- I wouldn't trust anyone who acted like that to run a business.", "NTA. You should consult a lawyer to protect your share of said business until you do sell. She obviously can't be trusted.", "What kinda trash bag leaves someone at the altar and then goes on the honeymoon?!? At the very least, the person left at the altar should get the trip. WTF.", "YWBTA if you do anything right now with a head full of sadness.", "YWBTA\n\nDon't base a business\\financial decision on emotions and your want to punish her.\n\nNo one plans a wedding planning to abandon it and her going on the honeymoon does not mean she is heartless or doesn't have regret. She came and told you in person, which sucked for her and for you. \n\nI would absolutely be speaking to a lawyer and looking for ways to divide the business, but not selling to a stranger within a few weeks so you destroy her or yourself financially. You need to deal with it like a grown up xx", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
