In fact, it's a very good idea to no longer be in business with someone who left you at the altar.", "NTA. But don't short change yourself and sell too low just to get out. Especially if you aren't involved in day to day operations that would force you to interact with her. But if you have a good offer, take it.", "INFO:\n\nEmotionally, it's probably a good idea for you not to be working together and I can see the appeal of detaching yourself as soon as possible. \n\nFinancially, it depends on the nature of your business: is it saleable right now? Does it rely on your or her personal knowledge/expertise/experience? Are there any buyers out there right now in a difficult world market? Could you buy her out rather than sell to a stranger? Or can she buy you out?\n\nFrankly, I would be very careful about making an emotional response to your business so quickly. Maybe use/have an intermediary at all meetings, try to hold those meetings on neutral ground, etc etc. Presumably you went into this business venture bc you believed in it; don't be too quick to throw away your involvement unless that's the right thing **for you** longer term.", "Sell your share of the business, and tell her she has  to pay you for your half of the honeymoon.\n\nSince she didn't even give you the choice to go.\n\nNTA everything that happens now is on her and her fault.\n\nI'm sorry she did that to you, no one deserves going through that.", "NTA.

Not only should you sell your half of the business, you should get your ring back and sell it.  \n\nRemember that the best revenge is leading a good happy life. And just think of how other men are going to regard her.

Working with her will only make things difficult for both of you", "Is also get her to compensate OP for the honeymoon. Also if anyone should have had it then it ought to have been him.", "I don't think is is an AITA issue.  Of course you are not the AH for wanting a clean split from your ex-fiancee who left you at the alter.  Of course not.  But right now you are going through an intensely emotional time and deciding to sell a business is more complicated than simply deciding you want out.\n\nYour options, if you don't want to continue having to deal with your ex every day in your business, are:\n\n* You both own the business but one of you steps down from the running of it, and you figure out some financial aspect to that. \n* One of you sells their half to the other. \n* One of you sells their half to a third party \n* You both sell the entire business. \n* You shut the business down. \n\nLegally, financially and emotionally, some of these are going to be more possible than others.  But given you have yet to see or speak to your ex since what should have been your wedding day, there are a lot of un resolved issues and you have no idea where she is at either.  Ask yourself how you feel about the business, not your ex.  Do you love it? Feel like you can make it go far?  Or was it something you did as a couple and you don't care?", "Do you have a written business partnership agreement? That often dictates that the each partner has first right to purchase the other owner's share of the company. A system for valuing the sale to the other partner would have been established. If the business was set up with no legal contract because 'we love and trust each other'... sell your share.", "NTA. Cut all ties you have with her", "NTA. But talk to a lawyer about what to do for the business", "YWNBTA \n\nI think finding a way to fully separate from her is a good idea. \n\nHow can you run a business with someone you won't trust again? She handled ending the relationship in an unkind, immature way, and I assume you'd rather never see her again. \n\nEither she can pay fair market value for your half or someone else gets it. Go through attorneys.", "NTA you should have sold it already", "NTA. Why maintain any ties with someone who had absolutely no consideration or respect for you, in any capacity? Get your fair share and say good riddance once and for all.", "I'm hoping that she will be the one to pay for all the cancellation of that day?  She did call it off...\n\nSell the business", "Nope, you would be NTA fir selling out. It would be difficult to work with her after the public humiliation she did to you. And taking the honeymoon for herself. \n\nI hope you can quickly get another business or a job.", "NTA if you don't want to be around her for hurt feelings.  A business arrangement after that could just turn resentful and tank the business.  Also if you paid for that honeymoon that you didn't go on your entitled to have of that money back.", "NTA. It\u2019s smart for both of you. Look at the income trend since the business began, gather the data you have about all the business assets, add in whatever you paid towards the honeymoon and wedding costs, and have a lawyer look it all over. Give your business partner the right to buy you out first, and if that\u2019s not something she can swing, then you can sell it to whomever you want. \n\nYou don\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to let her buy you out, but not giving her first refusal means she may scuttle the deal later in some way. Also it makes you look mature. \n\nNo special pricing, no discounts. This isn\u2019t \u201cfavors for friends\u201d time. This is business only. Conduct everything through legal council. If you let it get personal, then you run the risk of screwing yourself. The best way to win is to walk away profitable, and enjoy your life without her.", "Do run this by an attorney first.  Assuming you and she had papers drawn up when you started the business.  It should be assumed that your partnership in the business defines your respective roles and obligations. It should also specify how the partnership can be broken up id one partner wants out.\n\nIf you paid for any part of the wedding and honeymoon, your attorney can advise you on how to recoup those costs as well. Do this while she is gone so she is less able to do an end run around you.", "She had ample time to stop the marriage but didn't. He is being grown up and thinking about what's best for \"him\". She is no longer in need for consideration emotionally. \n\nHe is entitled to sell his part of the business regardless."]}
