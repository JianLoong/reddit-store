Side note, It was my first time flying with Leon, I\u2019ve flown with Paul many times. \n\nI have flight anxiety, and it is pretty bad, but not bad enough to get on a plane. It\u2019s usually at its worst during turbulence, take offs, and landings, and I tend to breath faster and my muscles tense up so badly. And sometimes I get too scared I freak out. So I always find touch to be my comfort. \n\nYes Leon and Paul both know about my flight anxiety. Paul is an unemotional person and believes that we shouldn\u2019t show emotions because we\u2019re man, so he\u2019s been teasing me about it since I was a kid. Leon is the complete opposite of Paul as he is caring and very kind person. \n\nSo, few days ago, we boarded the plane, and I started to tense up instantly which usually happens. So right before we took off, I asked Leon to hold my hand for a bit, Leon was obviously fine with it, he grabbed my hand and just held it for about 10 mins. Paul saw it and shot me a dirty look and was obviously annoyed. After 10 mins passed I felt better and we let each others hands go. \n\nThen maybe a hour and half into the flight, Leon was sleeping, and Paul and I was watching a movie.  We  hit some turbulence, and it was very unexpected and it scared me to the point I almost cried. I woke Leon up and grabbed his hand, and he just calmly comforted me. I explained to him what happened and Leon was okay with it. \n\nPaul on the other hand, got so annoyed he pulled my hand out of Leon\u2019s  and told me to stop being a crybaby and I was embarrassing Paul and Leon. \n\nI told him that Leon was being a comforting friend, and Paul said we\u2019re guys we shouldn\u2019t express emotions. That led to some big ass fight between Paul and I. He called me gay, because I showed emotions AND held hands with a male friend, And he said didn\u2019t want us to be judged by people around us and assume negative things just cause we showed emotions. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1674519564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10js4vo/aita_for_seeking_comfort_on_a_flight/", "score": 579, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The bottom line is, your fear is irrational, and you need to get over it.  Turbulence won't hurt you unless you refuse to wear your seatbelt.

YTA, and Paul has / is the problem.", "Paul seems like he\u2019s the most emotional out of all of you. You know exactly how to speak with your emotions, yet he starts fights on planes. NTA", "NTA and it surprised me not at all that Paul is homophobic.  I mean classic toxic masculinity, down to a T.  He's got a bad attitude and the balls to be insecure as hell about it.  If Leon is happy to hold hands then by all means do so OP, he sounds like a good friend.  Don't be afraid to feel your feelings, don't be afraid to express them.", "NTA the only embarrassing one here is Paul. Imagine being That insecure and homophobic that two friends can\u2019t comfort each other when scared.", "NTA glad you had a good friend there to help.  I actually feel sorry for Paul, he is full of toxic masculinity, and it\u2019s not healthy for him.  He\u2019s TA for trying to force it onto you though.", "NTA.\n\nPaul is a dick.", "NTA mate - emotions are a part of life and should be expressed. \nI went to a gig with my girlfriend and one of my mates, it was Nick Masons Saucerful of Secrets - a band I absolutely love.  I genuinely was so overwhelmed with happiness that I was holding hands with my mate and my girlfriend - it wasn\u2019t weird, it\u2019s wasn\u2019t sexual, it was literally just to experience something that my brain told me needed contact to help with.  \nDon\u2019t let someone berate you for having emotions - they\u2019re as much a part of the human experience as any other type of stimulus we get, if not more.", "Paul is a shit sack.", "NTA, but given that you know you have this flight anxiety, you owe it to yourself, and to the other people on the plane, to deal with it.\n\n\nGo see your doctor, and get a little something to help you deal with the anxiety.", "Or just get some meds. I have horrible flight anxiety and tried and tried with my therapist and couldn't get over it. So I just pop a valium an hour before I fly. I still don't fly often but now I can if I have to.", "Paul is OPs brother, it seems even shittier to act like a homophobe towards your own brother. He knew his brother had anxiety and still treated him poorly.", "as are annoyance, shame, and jealousy ;)", "Don\u2019t you need a prescription for Valium?", "A dad joke so bad you got downvoted 25+ times for it - woooweeee.", "Masturbating must be gay too by that logic since you are bringing a dick to completion and letting cum drop on you at the end", "Hes so emotional omg lol", "Yes. But flight anxiety is a pretty common and recognized thing so most PCPs are happy enough to write you a script for just enough to get you through a flight.", "Both proud and confused. Like my parents", "Yes ofc it is. Particularly if you enjoy a good taste ;} \n\nWhen will you people learn, us gays have taken you all over.", "So they still need to see someone about their anxiety, which is exactly what I suggested lol", "Haha I just meant if they can take the quick and easy way around and go to their primary care doctor as opposed to seeking out a therapist and working through it. Both are valid options."]}
