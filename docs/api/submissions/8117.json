Side note, It was my first time flying with Leon, I\u2019ve flown with Paul many times. \n\nI have flight anxiety, and it is pretty bad, but not bad enough to get on a plane. It\u2019s usually at its worst during turbulence, take offs, and landings, and I tend to breath faster and my muscles tense up so badly. And sometimes I get too scared I freak out. So I always find touch to be my comfort. \n\nYes Leon and Paul both know about my flight anxiety. Paul is an unemotional person and believes that we shouldn\u2019t show emotions because we\u2019re man, so he\u2019s been teasing me about it since I was a kid. Leon is the complete opposite of Paul as he is caring and very kind person. \n\nSo, few days ago, we boarded the plane, and I started to tense up instantly which usually happens. So right before we took off, I asked Leon to hold my hand for a bit, Leon was obviously fine with it, he grabbed my hand and just held it for about 10 mins. Paul saw it and shot me a dirty look and was obviously annoyed. After 10 mins passed I felt better and we let each others hands go. \n\nThen maybe a hour and half into the flight, Leon was sleeping, and Paul and I was watching a movie.  We  hit some turbulence, and it was very unexpected and it scared me to the point I almost cried. I woke Leon up and grabbed his hand, and he just calmly comforted me. I explained to him what happened and Leon was okay with it. \n\nPaul on the other hand, got so annoyed he pulled my hand out of Leon\u2019s  and told me to stop being a crybaby and I was embarrassing Paul and Leon. \n\nI told him that Leon was being a comforting friend, and Paul said we\u2019re guys we shouldn\u2019t express emotions. That led to some big ass fight between Paul and I. He called me gay, because I showed emotions AND held hands with a male friend, And he said didn\u2019t want us to be judged by people around us and assume negative things just cause we showed emotions. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1674519564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10js4vo/aita_for_seeking_comfort_on_a_flight/", "score": 280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's a homophobic insecure little boy. ;)\n\nEDIT: I dramatically reduced my flight and turbulence anxiety by flying a lot + educating myself on how planes stay in the air. Now I visualize what I've learned while we're flying and I know that even rough turbulence is very low risk for anything major happening.

Your brother\u2019s been exposed to a lot of really harmful attitudes about gender and orientation in regards to showing emotion. I\u2019d recommend that he read up on the ongoing mental health crisis facing men due to the unrealistic, toxic, and frankly stupid expectation of men not expressing emotion (not to mention divorce rates and heart disease).

Your brother is an idiot for his views that men shouldn\u2019t express emotion and/or touch other men both of which are healthy behaviors. \n\nHowever, you might want to work with a therapist on your phobia of flying.

You really gotta be careful with the \"anger is the only acceptable male emotion\" guys, cause well.....they get angry a lot.

He seems like a solid friend!)\n\nPaul... Well, Paul seems like he has a lot to deal with. Anger and shame are both emotions which means he expressed as many emotions during this flight as you did.
