Problem is she gave me the wrong bank details after I asked her MULTIPLE times to double check just in case, but she still managed to send me her wrong details. I obviously asked her again \u201care you sure this is your account?\u201d And she said \u201cyes I confirm this is my bank account\u201d. So I went ahead and I sent my half to said account and surprise, turns out that wasn\u2019t her account. I tried to block the transaction but the lucky person accepted it right away. I then called my bank to try and see if I could get the money and they said it could take over a month but we obviously need the money cause we\u2019re leaving in a few days. \n\nNow my friend expects me to pay half of my part again because she thinks that even though this was completely her fault I should still pay at least half of my half (so 100\u20ac) to help. I don\u2019t agree because I asked her multiple times to double check before confirming the payment and she almost made fun of me obsessing over this. And now that she made the mistake I\u2019m still expected to pay? \n\nShe\u2019s giving me the silent treatment and honestly I\u2019m not even in the mood to go now. I wanted to celebrate my graduation and I feel like this holiday is now kinda ruined because of a silly mistake. I\u2019m also short on money and I\u2019ve been saving up for over a year and I can\u2019t afford to pay 100\u20ac extra. If I had the money, I honestly would have paid her my entire half again even though that was her mistake but then she started acting all weird and lecturing me on real friendship saying that true friends shouldn\u2019t act like this. This added more fuel to the fire and I feel like she\u2019s painting me to be this cruel and manipulative friend for simply not wanting to pay again.

He, of course, thought it was a scam, but luckily, he got in touch with their support and authorized the reversal. Otherwise no recourse.", "In Nz as long as the number is correct u can put dildo as the name, and the transaction will be honoured lol although, the odds of this mistake happening here are almost impossible.

Maybe the account number is a family members? I hate to think the worst of people, but it's a bit strange she confirmed the wrong number multiple times.", "Normally, a direct bank transfer would be fine. Unless a situation like this happens.
