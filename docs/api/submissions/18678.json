You're allowed to do anything up to the definition of what's not allowed by the rule.  If the intention is for boys to have shorter hair than that, then the rule should say that boys must have shorter hair than that.  It says that hair must be shorter than shoulder length so hair that is shorter than shoulder length is allowed.

One thing that we don't really take into account is how heavily sanitized our view of past societies are. In pretty much the entire world prior to the 1970s, people thought about the world, and their relationships with each other, in a way that is fairly alien to modern sensibilities. In short, they did not think that violence was inherently wrong, and were fully comfortable using it to enforce social norms. The dominant view was that every relationship should be structured as a hierarchy based on social norms dictating who had authority over the others, and that those higher up on the hierarchy had a very broad right to enforce their position on it through physical force; patterns in capacity to wield physical force are the true origin of the traditional social hierarchy to begin with.\n\nCorporal punishment in school was legal in every state except New Jersey (they banned it in 1867) until 1971, and is still legal in 20 states, where they disproportionately beat Black and disabled children. Often, these disabled children are actually beat for behavior that is a direct symptom of their disability, like a Tourette's tic. This is despite evidence pretty clearly showing that the practice has no observable benefit and harms all children, both in the short and long term, even reducing lifetime educational achievement and raising crime rates. As terrible as this is, it used to be much, much worse, and even more arbitrary, in every respect.\n\nAnother example of how much more authoritarian schools were in the past is how we viewed and treated bullying. Prior to the 1970s, the overwhelmingly dominant view of bullying, even when it was physically violent, was actually that it was a normal, unavoidable, even *good* thing; it was a crucial part of indoctrination into social norms, especially gender norms, which they valued extremely highly, possibly more highly than the wellbeing of the individual children.\n\nSorry for the long-winded response, but I think that it is important for us to be honest and informed about our history and where many of the trends that continue today originated. We aren't taught the actual, ground level history of something as central to our lives as the legal and socially normative relationships between husband and wives, and between parents and children, in school, and as a result there is a false perception of a kindness and gentleness to past eras that truly is opposed to what actually happened, which is that conformity to traditional social norms was built on their enforcement through physical, hierarchical violence.", "Yes.

She's a fairly conservative dresser so she didn't care to wear short shorts anyway, but she had a devil of a time finding anything acceptable.", "Okey doke.", "Doubtful, as I've had long bushy hair most of my life, and now it includes a full bushy beard. \n\nIt's hilarious you seem to know exactly how the rules are written, and at the same time forget this Dad has admitted his kids haircut pushed the boundaries his entire time in the school. \n\nAnd they finally got called on it.", "> He keeps his hair just above his shoulders due to his school dress code (boys can\u2019t have hair at or below their shoulders).\n\nLiterally from the OP.\n\n> I responded to ask why, and he said (in more polite terminology) that my son has been skirting the hair length rules this whole year, and his hair length/style are against the spirit of the rules.\n\nThe teacher literally admits he\u2019s in code, it\u2019s just \u201cagainst the spirit of the rules.\u201d\n\nIt's a binary\u2014either he's in violation or he's not.", "Yeah, this. There no such thing as \"technically\" in the rules. His shoulder length hair is either meeting the defined criteria or its not. Clearly this teacher things the rule isn't strict enough, and is trying to use weasel words to twist the rule to be in line with his personal opinion.\n\nIf there is a disagreement between the \"spirit,\" of the rule and the actual rule, it's on the authorities that created the rule to amend it to bring them in line. If the teacher this the rule is too lax, he needs to take it up with the principal.\n\nAllowing the authorities to punish individuals because they violated the spirit of the rule while complying with the rule as implemented  is just inviting petty tyrants to abuse their power.", "He's within the rules.  It sounds like the teacher is one who is either obsessive about gender roles/gender based appearances or is mad that Aiden refuses to fit a very narrow mold but instead wants to be his own person while still maintaining the rules.", "Then they should force the girls to cut their hair just as short as well", "Yeah, I have an office job and am covered in tattoos including my hands. The times have changed \ud83d\ude02", "oh yes! I remember how my FIL wanted to take my hubby shopping for \"proper attire\" when he started working for Google ten years ago. Seriously, those guys run around barefooted and in shorts even in winter (and this is Switzerland, not South Africa, we get snow and freezing temperatures).", "If they're anything like me, they're just so sick of women getting benefit of the doubt that they saw \"authoritarian\" paired with male pronouns and jumped the gun lol", "Thanks. Hadn't even seen that I'd hit two years, lol.", "Dress codes usually discriminate based on gender. Never seen one that didn\u2019t call out male standards and then female standards.", "I assume you are referring to [case fatality rate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate)\n as referring to the [mortality rate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate)\n without providing a timeframe for it is meaningless.\n\nIf so your comment is [factually incorrect](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) - but even if it wasn't, vaccines helped reaching herd immunity\nand reduced contagion risk, thus helping prevent an exponential spread of the virus.\n\nIt is also worth noting that death isn't the only risk posed by covid as many people are still dealing with its long term effects and that shielding people from getting sick in first place also helped avoiding hospitals getting congested, thus becoming infection hubs full of vulnerable patients.\n\nAdd to that the sheer amount of wasting of resources and human suffering the vaccines have prevented and you people sound downright delusional.\n\nThe fact that a bunch of armchairs activists who are unfamiliar with even basic medical terminology can actually convince themselves that their opinion trumps that of experts all over the world is the greatest display of Dunning Kruger effect I have ever witnessed.", "I\u2019ve seen someone shit up before. Such a traumatic experience.", "A turtleneck sweater should be their ultimate Puritan dream top! It covers all of the skin!!", "Haha that reminds me of how our district-wide uniform colors were red and black even for the school that had green and white for school colors", "I graduated HS in Ontario in 2003 and we did have a \"handbook\" (a bunch of pages at the beginning of the agenda they gave us the first week) and we had the standard \"no bra straps showing or crop tops\" nonsense dress code but otherwise we were pretty free to wear whatever. There were a few guys with hair well past their shoulders and both genders with mohawks.", "Yeah as a kid it freaked me out only because it was a gift from a beloved relative and of course I was gonna wear it. As an adult I think back on it and just can\u2019t wrap my mind around the absurdity of it all.
