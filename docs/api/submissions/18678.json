You're allowed to do anything up to the definition of what's not allowed by the rule.  If the intention is for boys to have shorter hair than that, then the rule should say that boys must have shorter hair than that.  It says that hair must be shorter than shoulder length so hair that is shorter than shoulder length is allowed.

Good on the OP's son to have managed to avoid outright conflict while resisting the conformity.
