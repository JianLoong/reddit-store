You're allowed to do anything up to the definition of what's not allowed by the rule.  If the intention is for boys to have shorter hair than that, then the rule should say that boys must have shorter hair than that.  It says that hair must be shorter than shoulder length so hair that is shorter than shoulder length is allowed.

His hair is either currently technically within the rules or it is not.  It seems that, indeed, the recent cut brought him within code.  So, based on this phone call, this is the teacher\u2019s attempt to put him in his place and basically punish him for prior infractions (as well as having the nerve to violate). But given that his hair is not currently violating the rules, I would actually say that it is the teacher that is going rogue - rules are rules, and they are meant to be clear so that students know how to follow them and where they may go wrong. The personal interpretation of any member of administration is irrelevant, in part because this is the exact kind of situation that makes for subjective punishments, exactly as it has happened now. \n\nQuite ironic that this teacher is emphasizing the need to follow rules when your son actually is currently following the rules. If they wanted the \u201cspirit\u201d of the rules to be followed, they should have written it in. And that is also a life lesson - you absolutely should be challenging authorities when they abuse or misinterpret the rules.  Yes, even courts look at the spirit and intent of laws, but when things are written so plainly on their face like this, there seems to be no room for interpretation (I don\u2019t see how \u201cabove the shoulders\u201d can be interpreted any other way, and courts absolutely would look to the fact that this rule wasn\u2019t written in some other way).  And I say this as a lawyer. Respecting authorities should only occur when they are acting in a manner worthy of respect.  This willy nilly random subjective interpretation of s clearly stated rule in order to punish your son for not prostrating himself to the authorities is exactly the type of situation that doesn\u2019t deserve said authorities to be respected.  Good on your for standing by him.", "Part of being an adult is making your own decisions about your hair. Sure there are workplaces that have hair stipulations, but not typically on hair length.

And when my kids go to school, getting their hair cut will be a regular rat-chase for the school, if they like longer hair like their father. I will get them cut, but only after the school has to chase us for a while.\n\nAnd hell, I am also going to use every word of the rule to my benefit. There's no spirit of the rule here.

You and your kid have followed the rule, and that's all that was needed. And that rule is as spirit in that rule. It's as soulless as a dead body.\n\nAnd well, we do need to teach our kids to respect the rules. But not the whims of those tasked to be the authorities.
