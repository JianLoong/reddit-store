That graduation is coming up, and all the students need to look mature and put together for the ceremony.

If I have that right, the teacher is entirely out of line, it's too late to make up new rules now and I doubt he has the authority, plus he sucks for giving you parenting advice (and really bad advice, too).  \n\nIgnore the teacher.

His teacher doesn't have a point. You did not get a complaint since you have not violated the code. Also, was maybe this letter sent before the most recent hair cut?\n\nIf your son wants a hair cut - that's fine - but don't let the school bully him into it. Honestly - no one at graduation is going to notice or care.

The length of your hair has as much bearing on your ability to learn as your gender or your height or your skin colour.  This isn't about discipline, it's about the school and its image.

Even if he's \"skirting the rules\" he's still following them (dress codes being a whole different level of BS is a different discussion) so \"laying down the law\" would very easily mean making sure its kept within the guidelines, barely or otherwise.

You're allowed to do anything up to the definition of what's not allowed by the rule.  If the intention is for boys to have shorter hair than that, then the rule should say that boys must have shorter hair than that.  It says that hair must be shorter than shoulder length so hair that is shorter than shoulder length is allowed.  That teacher is real father of the year material.\n\n\n\nOn a bit of a tangent but I had hair down to my shoulders through high school.

I have no patience for \"you should obviously know this is what we meant and comply with Our Authority, even though it's not written anywhere\" people.
