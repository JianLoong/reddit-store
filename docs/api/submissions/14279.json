Grandfather founded our church circa 1972 and is still pastoring. Dad (55M) is due to become the lead pastor in a couple months. He and Mom (52F) met there and married 30 years ago. My sister and I did not have kids our age at church, and dating is difficult for religious people like us. 2 years ago, I wanted to convert to Catholicism but was told \"If you leave our church, I don't see how we can have a relationship\" from Mom and \"You're a liar and a deceiver\" from Dad. Needless to say, I did not convert.\n\n**Story:** Mom found out that Sister had begun seeing Colleague. Per Sister, Mom said \"If you two have children, your kids will be nothing.\" Sister was obviously upset. I told her that I did not agree with Mom's stance on interracial marriage and I had no religious objection to it.\n\n2 weeks later, Sister stated that there was an event about 1 1/2 hours away that she wanted to go to and that I should come. She then stated that Colleague would drive down as well. We all met there. He is about 5'6\", head full of locs, glasses, hard of hearing (so Deaf-sounding speech), and all laughs. He made her smile, and I was invisible for how enthralled they were with each other. (For clarity, she had previously said that he also was raised in a similar religious background.)\n\nApparently, this was a secret from Dad. Mom blamed Sister for causing secrets in her marriage. Mom also took me aside and said Sister was lying to manipulate the situation. (I confirmed with Sister. She wasn't.)\n\nFinally after 4 weeks, the truth came out. Dad thought on it for a day, then he confronted Sister. He said \"You've always been entitled and rebellious. If you want to go your own way, then you need to go on.\" Sister was visibly upset and went for a drive. Later that night after church, I had been giving Dad the cold shoulder, so he confronted me and asked if I was mad. I said that I disagreed with his position on interracial relationships and that he didn't handle the situation well.\n\nSister and I left church. Parents didn't come home for a while. Mom comes home and doesn't know about Dad. She calls and then comes bursting back in. She says \"Dad drove to his office and sitting in his truck, wailing. He says his kids have turned against him, they don't love him, and he wasn't going to come home.\" Mom blamed me for telling him my feelings and Sister for involving and manipulating everyone.\n\nMom convinced Dad to come home. We were told to sit and listen to her. She said that she had prayed for God to end her life so she wouldn't have to see her family broken up and that God didn't make any mistakes putting us together. The next few days, Mom and Dad would continually smile at us to try and make us smile back at them.\n\nAITA for telling Dad how I felt and causing the breakdown?", "created_utc": 1680959160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12flhzm/aita_for_being_honest_with_my_family/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is that the kind of person you want to be? Really? You're endorsing hate and sitting there as adults with parents trying to get you to smile? That does not sound normal for 27. It doesn't sound normal at any age.\n\nYour sister is with someone who makes her happy. If your parents can't be happy for her, she will likely go NC. And you're going to need to decide-- put up with their bigotry, or have a relationship with your sister. Which is more important to you?\n\nNTA right now, but you're facing a big choice here.

He has to let go if he wants his children to be happy.", "NTA. Going NC with your parents and this church/cult would probably be the best thing for you and your sister", "NTA- This is why I'm glad I put a stopper on my dad forcing our religion onto me at 16. Ironically, later in life, I would actually agree with some Catholic beliefs, but it was the delivery that never sat well. The burning in hell, the hypocrisy of love- it was okay for my aunt and my uncle to be gay but his own child- unfathomable (for the record I am bi, and he has accepted that fact), but then their was the forced meetings with this old man in his Bible group. He once had the audacity to come and perform a sermon in out living room for 3hrs on a Saturday morning when my siblings and I had better things to do like homework was now mandatory on the weekends/I had bad insomnia so I was not worth it to me even if I had slept it wasn't a lot.\n\nSo here's where things lay. You've now created a distance between the cultists and yourselves, and not sorry for calling them that, but if I quacks like a duck, it's definitely a duck. If it threatens excommunication because you put the socks on the wrong feet, it's a cult. Now comes the crisis of faith for your parents, and if they are immovable, you might never have a relationship with them. However  if they are threatening suicide and not doing it because of God there's an opportunity here to be exploited, and that opportunity is their crisis of faith- maybe they'll change or change religions just so they can have their kids in their life. Because even though they are old and stubborn that stubbornness is unfortunately gonna program them to be I'm your life if you like it or not. That's where you exploit. You tell them that in order to retain a relationship, they can not go Jimmy Swaggert on you two and lecture you both now that you are adults, and only God can judge you and your sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They aren\u2019t allowing their children to thrive and prosper in their adulthood. I\u2019d really stop and ask yourself what sort of damage trying to gain their \u201capproval\u201d (impossible really) creates in your life.

And you mom is also manipulative and very intolerant if she treatens to cut all link with you for dating outside your religion or thinking to change church (it's not like you wanted to praise satan, good Lord !).

There\u2019s two paths set before you here which I believe end in vastly different outcomes.\n\nThere\u2019s the one where you continue to live a life systematically controlled and manipulated by your parents and what THEY want, it\u2019s not about you and your own life, your life is about them. When they eventually pass away, you will think about how you did right by them but how you did wrong by yourself, you may be left with deep deep regret and anger towards them knowing they stole so many opportunities from you that were no one else\u2019s but your own.\n\nOr there\u2019s the second path, the one where you sit down with your sister and emotionally plan for yourselves and your futures, if at any point along the way your family continue to throw their bibles and toys out of the pram then it is truly their loss and your gain. When emotionally planning for your future consider that cutting ties with your parents may undoubtedly have to be the option to ensure your own happiness. You get one life and I guess that\u2019s up for debate when the aspect of religion is thrown into the mix but why take the risk of wasting the only one you (may) have. \n\nYour parents at some point need to understand that in no uncertain terms will you go on tolerating the selfish and manipulative hold they wish to go on having over both their children. That if they want to miss out on family, on memories, grandchildren then that\u2019s truly their own path to take. I\u2019m interracial by the way as is my brother, in answering your dad we\u2019re very much not NOTHING.
