Grandfather founded our church circa 1972 and is still pastoring. Dad (55M) is due to become the lead pastor in a couple months. He and Mom (52F) met there and married 30 years ago. My sister and I did not have kids our age at church, and dating is difficult for religious people like us. 2 years ago, I wanted to convert to Catholicism but was told \"If you leave our church, I don't see how we can have a relationship\" from Mom and \"You're a liar and a deceiver\" from Dad. Needless to say, I did not convert.\n\n**Story:** Mom found out that Sister had begun seeing Colleague. Per Sister, Mom said \"If you two have children, your kids will be nothing.\" Sister was obviously upset. I told her that I did not agree with Mom's stance on interracial marriage and I had no religious objection to it.\n\n2 weeks later, Sister stated that there was an event about 1 1/2 hours away that she wanted to go to and that I should come. She then stated that Colleague would drive down as well. We all met there. He is about 5'6\", head full of locs, glasses, hard of hearing (so Deaf-sounding speech), and all laughs. He made her smile, and I was invisible for how enthralled they were with each other. (For clarity, she had previously said that he also was raised in a similar religious background.)\n\nApparently, this was a secret from Dad. Mom blamed Sister for causing secrets in her marriage. Mom also took me aside and said Sister was lying to manipulate the situation. (I confirmed with Sister. She wasn't.)\n\nFinally after 4 weeks, the truth came out. Dad thought on it for a day, then he confronted Sister. He said \"You've always been entitled and rebellious. If you want to go your own way, then you need to go on.\" Sister was visibly upset and went for a drive. Later that night after church, I had been giving Dad the cold shoulder, so he confronted me and asked if I was mad. I said that I disagreed with his position on interracial relationships and that he didn't handle the situation well.\n\nSister and I left church. Parents didn't come home for a while. Mom comes home and doesn't know about Dad. She calls and then comes bursting back in. She says \"Dad drove to his office and sitting in his truck, wailing. He says his kids have turned against him, they don't love him, and he wasn't going to come home.\" Mom blamed me for telling him my feelings and Sister for involving and manipulating everyone.\n\nMom convinced Dad to come home. We were told to sit and listen to her. She said that she had prayed for God to end her life so she wouldn't have to see her family broken up and that God didn't make any mistakes putting us together. The next few days, Mom and Dad would continually smile at us to try and make us smile back at them.\n\nAITA for telling Dad how I felt and causing the breakdown?", "created_utc": 1680959160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12flhzm/aita_for_being_honest_with_my_family/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In addition to that, your parents have exhibited racist behaviour and attitudes. \n\nIn addition to THAT, your parents have exhibited rigid attitudes and beliefs that they apparently would prefer to hold to rather than have a loving family. \n\nAnd in addition to THAT, your mother \u2014 someone who, given your faith description, would undoubtedly consider suicide a sin \u2014 tells you that she \u2018prayed for God to end her life\u2019 when confronted with a deviation from the norms they seek to enforce. This is utter manipulation. \n\nYou are NTA. I hope you focus your honesty on yourself, and examine whether your family and its self-made faith are actually invested in what\u2019s best for your sister and you, or simply on holding to dogma. There are other ways to live. There are other faiths to follow, even Pentecostal faiths. Do not roll over to be placed back under the manipulative ways of your parents.", "NTA. Your parents are literal religious extremists, racist, and are emotionally abusing/manipulating you and your sister. Your parents need to get called out for way more than what you said, and I know it would have been hard for you to stand up as much as you have so far!", "NTA.\n\nYour parents sure are, though. You've done everything right. Keep supporting your sister.", "You\u2019re NTA. Your parents are racist assholes who will either come around to modern times or not, but you\u2019re not responsible for their bigotry and the consequences of it. \n\nIt looks like they\u2019ve been extremely manipulative and at least a little emotionally abusive to you and your sister. I hate to say this because they are your parents who you love, but you may benefit from some time away to get your perspective right and absolve yourself from misplaced guilt. Loving parents do not threaten to disown you for choosing to live your life differently from their plans for you.", "NTA! It is past time for you and your sister to leave your bigoted parents and go make your own way in the world. There are plenty of religions that do not support racism. Go find one that meets your spiritual needs.", "NTA.\n\nThey are your parents so I will say this the kindest and most respectful way possible. They are the kind of religious parents whom non religious people think of when they warn their families and friends. \n\nThey are forcing you to choose between church and your future. They are forcing your sister to choose between her parents and her future. \n\nThey are emotionally manipulating you and your sister (my kids don\u2019t love, I pray that I die blah blah), just to keep you as they want this \u2018picture perfect\u2019 family. \n\nYou didn\u2019t cause breakdown in the family.

I\u2019m glad that despite being raised by small minded, racist, manipulative religious zealots, you and your sister have your own minds and see the world differently. Theres probably no hope of your parents changing their ways. Now, I\u2019m sure that at times their disapproval and manipulation makes you feel like YOU are the one doing something wrong (as evidenced by your post) because people are wired to care about their parents opinions. In this case, please be assured, that you are absolutely, totally, unquestionably right, and they are disgusting, intolerant, backwards people and humongous AHs.", "NTA.  And you need to listen.  Your parents are zealots and are abusing you and your sister.  Get out.  Get out now.  Take your sister and whatever money and things you can find and run.  Go no contact for a few months and both you and your sister get in therapy.  Once you feel stable you can try to reconnect with them and set healthy boundaries. Stop being emotionally blackmailed.

Your father won\u2019t cry in his car if he doesn\u2019t have an audience. \n\nTell both your parents that they will have a family when they start following the word of Jesus. Quote Bible verses about acceptance and love. They are using religion as an excuse for hatred and bigotry.", "NTA. You are supporting your sister and standing up against your parents for their racist views and response, that is to be commended.\n\nHowever, given that your mom is directing the blame towards you and your sister, and has informed you that she prayed for God to end her life so she doesn't see her family broken, I do wonder how honest she was being about your dad sat in the car wailing? Because given your mom reported to you his behaviour and you apparently didn't witness it yourselves, I wonder if this was a tale told to emotionally manipulate you and your sister into ceding to their wishes/demands.", "You're nta. Sticking up for what you believe is right and defending your sister is commendable if anything.", "NTA.\n\nYour father acts like a child who doesn't get what he wants. You are both adults and free to date whoever you please. The only ones turning against anyone is your parents not wishing to be a part of your life if you have free will.\n\nYou didn't cause any breakdown. You are a good person who was being honest about your feelings, if that is a problem to your parents then that speaks lots about them.", "Wait, you and your sister are both ADULTS at 27 years old. Why are you so attached to your parents and in need of their approval? And why are you still following a hate-filled bigoted version of \"Christianity\" (I put that in quotes bc I don't think racism is very Christian) just so you're not disowned by your parents? Is that the kind of person you want to be? Really? You're endorsing hate and sitting there as adults with parents trying to get you to smile? That does not sound normal for 27. It doesn't sound normal at any age.\n\nYour sister is with someone who makes her happy. If your parents can't be happy for her, she will likely go NC. And you're going to need to decide-- put up with their bigotry, or have a relationship with your sister. Which is more important to you?\n\nNTA right now, but you're facing a big choice here. An adult choice. Can you make a choice, OP? Bc if you stick with bigotry you will be T A.", "NTA. That's a hard situation. Your parents are holding on to some very outdated beliefs.\n\nMom blaming sister for creating secrets is unreasonable. Your Father is to blame for the secrets, because no one feels safe sharing with him. You can't be an asshole when people tell you things, then be surprised when people stop telling you things.\n\nYour dad is being unreasonable and manipulating his children to try and hold on to his outdated religious beliefs. He has to let go if he wants his children to be happy.", "NTA. Going NC with your parents and this church/cult would probably be the best thing for you and your sister", "NTA- This is why I'm glad I put a stopper on my dad forcing our religion onto me at 16. Ironically, later in life, I would actually agree with some Catholic beliefs, but it was the delivery that never sat well. The burning in hell, the hypocrisy of love- it was okay for my aunt and my uncle to be gay but his own child- unfathomable (for the record I am bi, and he has accepted that fact), but then their was the forced meetings with this old man in his Bible group. He once had the audacity to come and perform a sermon in out living room for 3hrs on a Saturday morning when my siblings and I had better things to do like homework was now mandatory on the weekends/I had bad insomnia so I was not worth it to me even if I had slept it wasn't a lot.\n\nSo here's where things lay. You've now created a distance between the cultists and yourselves, and not sorry for calling them that, but if I quacks like a duck, it's definitely a duck. If it threatens excommunication because you put the socks on the wrong feet, it's a cult. Now comes the crisis of faith for your parents, and if they are immovable, you might never have a relationship with them. However  if they are threatening suicide and not doing it because of God there's an opportunity here to be exploited, and that opportunity is their crisis of faith- maybe they'll change or change religions just so they can have their kids in their life. Because even though they are old and stubborn that stubbornness is unfortunately gonna program them to be I'm your life if you like it or not. That's where you exploit. You tell them that in order to retain a relationship, they can not go Jimmy Swaggert on you two and lecture you both now that you are adults, and only God can judge you and your sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents are manipulative as hell :) I hope they will see their error, but it's up to them. Sorry for you and your sister, but you will be better by yourselves.", "Omg your family sounds absolutely exhausting.", "What fucking year is it where you are dude. If you get dismissed from a cult you run bro! Whatever religion that is, is TA.", "NTA YOur dad is a toxic AH, your mom is his enabler. THey are manipuilating and guilting you.  GET OUT.", "NTA. Your parents are racist. They also threatened to cut you off for converting. \n\nYour dad's being a drama queen. So is your mom. They're adults. They can behave like adults.", "Have you read up on narcissism? There are a lot of resources on how faith is used as a method of manipulation and how entire systems (eg a church, ideology) can become toxic control.\n\nLong story short, your parents are wrong here. They aren\u2019t allowing their children to thrive and prosper in their adulthood. I\u2019d really stop and ask yourself what sort of damage trying to gain their \u201capproval\u201d (impossible really) creates in your life. It\u2019s okay to leave them behind and let them figure out how to grow up and be better or wallow away from you.", "NTA - I think you are perceiving your religion from the heart and your parents are applying it from dogma and control. If a religion praises God but can't show basic tolerance for it's neighbor I think this is a sick religion. And please, the heart of your partner is more important than his/her religion (and skin color). If a couple can be happy together and each being respectful of the other one's values, it is all that matter. \n\nAnd by the way, your dad is manipulative AF and kind of drama queen/king. He feels more about his reputation and/or virtue than the wellness of his oun daughter. And you mom is also manipulative and very intolerant if she treatens to cut all link with you for dating outside your religion or thinking to change church (it's not like you wanted to praise satan, good Lord !). And your parents are racists disgused in religious righteousness, it is still plain racism. I don't know what your church preach, but is seems it's application is biaised.\n\nAbout your question directly, staying silent to keep peace would have made you an A H to your sister and to your conscience. There is a lot of shit that needs to be stired for you to free yourselves from their control. You might loose your parents, yes. But is being a spineless obedient child better that living freely, from your heart and conscience ?"]}
