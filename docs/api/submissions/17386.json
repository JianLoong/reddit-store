My oldest children are married and recently had children. My son and my dil have a 10-month-old son and my daughter and son-in-law have a 1-year-old daughter and she's currently pregnant. The problem lies when my son and daughter-in-law confronted me and my husband on why we are much closer to my daughter and her family. When my daughter gave birth she wanted me in the delivery room with her so I knew her firstborn since the day she was born and I and my husband are obsessed with her. The exact opposite was for my son and daughter-in-law. They didn't even tell us their son was born until almost a week after. That was fine since that was their choice. What made the boat tip was when my family would ask when we could meet the baby and they told us we couldn't see the baby until he was older. This did confuse us since her parents were able to meet him the same day he was born but we didn't question it. We didn't meet him until Mother's Day (This year) my son and his family decided to visit with the baby. The baby was cute and did try and bond with her but my DIL didn't even let us hold her. Anyways, I was showing my son and his family around because my house has changed a lot since I last saw them.\n\n Everything was fine until they saw that my daughter's children had a playroom/bedroom in my home. They asked if their son had a room in my room and I said no because this is the first time I have seen him in person. My DIL got upset and said that it didn't matter because I should be treating my grandchildren equally and for the whole day I've been showing my daughter's kids more attention. I then told her that me and my husband have been trying to bond with their kid but we aren't even allowed to hold him and that she was crazy to think he would have a room here when we probably aren't gonna see him again until Christmas. She ended up getting upset and dragging my son and their kid out of the house. I thought everything was fine until on Facebook I saw her making posts about bad grandmothers which were directed towards me and I'm starting to feel bad so Reddit AITA?\n\nEdit: a user wanted me to add this: In no way have I done anything to my son and DIL. I and my DIL were very close until they got married. I didn't want her to marry my son because of the way he treated her and carried himself. I've tried to get my son help but he refuses so that's why our relationship is strained. Once they got married they weren't very close to me anymore. I've always invited them over and let them know my home is always open but they declined any offer and stopped seeing my family until mother's day.", "created_utc": 1684244370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j5izh/aita_for_being_honest_with_my_dil_on_why_im_not/", "score": 250, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why can\u2019t your DIL\u2019s child use that space instead of needing their own dedicated room? \n\nNow it\u2019s completely true that your DIL is behaving immaturely and being unreasonable but you shouldn\u2019t have bought in to her craziness.

Is she just normally a jerk? Did you and your son have a falling out?", "you are NTA. It seems that you and your husband are just naturally closer to your daughter children because well, they are around. You can\u2019t bond with someone if they aren\u2019t around you.

Lots of people  worry about people holding their babies the first six months, due to babies not being vaccinated against a lot of diseases. It's not fair to throw a fit and say you won't be close to the kid because of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it is also unrealistic for the kid to have a room at your house if you never see him. Though what you MIGHT consider, is calling the room the kid's room and making it available for any grandchildren that come through.", "OP wrote - For me, I can't bond with someone without hugging and stuff. I didn't feel anything toward my husband until we were close enough to hug and kiss each other. - so if you can\u2019t physically hugging or kissing someone you feel nothing for them? - I\u2019m getting you crossed boundaries lines with you DIL vibes - maybe touching her baby bump when she wasn\u2019t comfortable with that - you talking how you\u2019ll be hugging and kissing the ba y like you do your grandaughter - and your DIL/Son not being comfortable with that.", "I'm gonna say YTA for your attitude here.\n\nIf you see one kid almost everyday, yes, you'll build more of a bond. Totally valid. But your post is telling; you talk about how you weren't in the delivery room, didn't meet the baby day 1 and don't seem to recongise that DIL likely felt very vulnerable and wanted some time to recover before she saw you. You cannot use that as a reason not to be as close with your grandchild; reading between the lines, it does look like you resent the boundaries DIL has set.\n\nYou do need to pay both children equal attention. If you spent an entire day focused on one grandchild and not the other, that's a problem. Why not just have a playroom both kids can enjoy when they visit?", "YTA. Yeah you see one grandchild more than the other, but when I was a kid my cousins lived on the same block as my grandma and I lived two hours away but I would have been really hurt if she made it clear she preferred the local kids. You could just have a generic playroom. Just because you have more disagreements in one DIL vs. your daughter, treating the kids unfairly will only cause the kids hurt.\n\nEdit: is your age a typo or did you have kids at 14 and 15?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because the easiest reason one can think for your DIL to want so much distance between you and her family is that you did something to her or you mistreat her, or that you favor your daughter over your son and that reflects in how much access they give you to their children. \n\nBut it turns out it's your son who did something to his wife, and you not being close or liking him as much as your daughter is a direct consequence of his actions. This is very relevant for judging the situation. \n\nWith this info, I think NTA - Your DIL is either being manipulated by your son not to include you in their lives much (could be because he resents you for not backing him up unconditionally --which you shouldn't-- or that he's afraid you're going to support your DIL in leaving him, etc.). Or she's pinning all her anger and unsolved issues with her husband onto you and making you the scapegoat for their problems. \n\nEither way, you can only respect her and your son's wishes and boundaries about their son. However, it's logical that you won't have the same relationship with their child as you do with the grandchildren you get to bond with and spend time with constantly. It's not that you favor ones over the other, it's not even that you love ones more than the other. It's simply that you have not been allowed to bond with this child almost at all. \n\nAnd honestly, I'd bet if they arrived to your house and discovered a whole room set up for their baby that you haven't even met yet, they'd (or likely she) would've freaked out about it anyway... because it'd be tad weird.", "Oh my god OP, that's absolutely a missing reason. Your DIL is probably keeping you at arms length while expecting you to play nice because you're associated with her husband who cheated on her.\n\nThat doesn't make her correct about how she's going about the favoritism discussion, but it does explain a lot here, especially if you \"don't agree\" with your son while still supporting him here.", "So I was right.

Typically, MIL is not in the delivery room- the woman's mother or partner is because it's about comfort. And if partner is responsible for dispensing info but not close to his mom, explains the delay in the info.\n\nIn short- there may be a problem between a parent and OP, but it's not the parent we assumed. If she's judgemental against her son (rightfully so or not) there's the wedge. Add in DIL seems to be the protective type (I think it does need to be pointed out that the not seeing is happening at the tail end of the pandemic and some parents even now are still gunshy about taking very young kids around a lot of different people) and there's some reasoning behind what's happening. \n\nI think OP might be taking some things as slights against her that aren't meant to be slights, but son may also be a big cause if their relationship isn't always good.\n\nDoesn't mean they should have the same relationship, but it does mean OP needs to be a bit careful if she wants a relationship with son and dil's kids.
