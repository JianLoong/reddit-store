All day then you have an issue and really need to get landlord in order or just stomach the cost of repair.\n\nAs to wound cleaning, I am sure you have a kettle to heat up water. If not get one.", "Ultimately, NTA. \n\nI'm not sure what kind of surgery she had, but waiting an hour shouldn't make a major difference. For instance, we have patients that sleep shorter or longer time frames. If someone went to bed and got up one hour later, would they then have an infection from sleeping in for an extra hour?

Anybody who says \"it\u2019s just one tiny thing\u201d isn't looking at the whole list (feeding, housing, driving, mobility, office).  Your sister, who has had major surgery, is entitled to have poor perspective -- but should learn it quickly.  Your parents are the source of the problem here, because they should have told the sister she was being unreasonable.  Sister should get up earlier, get up later, find another method of washing, or something.  \"Sit in her own filth\" is pure manipulation.  Your parents should support you as a loving sister who is doing everything she can.  You should not be pushed in areas you care about as you've given up a *lot* as you're used to your own space.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re already doing enough to accomodate her. How hard is it for her to wake up sooner than usual? Does she just sit and let her surgical scars get dirty instead of using a rag to clean them?", "NTA\n\nbut I'd suggest figuring something out, regardless. Your sister is definitely being the asshole but if it's true that she is in recovery, her bathing schedule might be a bit more demanding than yours.\n\nYou say yourself that your schedule is flexible, and you have such a flexible schedule that you can have an entire block of time between your work hours. Yeah, routine is important and you're entitled to your routine in your own home, there's no question there, but how much do you value it over your sister's recovery? \n\nIt seems you might've only brought her in out of obligation, and now you feel rightfully burdened by it, and don't want to move another inch for her benefit. That's a little misguided in my opinion, and maybe even a little passive aggressive. Are you just refusing to budge out of some sense of regaining control and power over your apartment, or is this really that big of a deal for your schedule and routine?", "NTA - Her recovery does require her to get enough sleep, but that does not mean she needs to sleep until 10am. She could go to bed earlier and then wake up earlier. She can even take a nap after her shower.", "If you have access to the water heater, just go and turn up the temperature. Google how to do it if you have questions. \n\nThere will still be the same volume of hot water available but it will be hotter, so you can mix it with more cold water, thereby lowering the flow rate of the hot water, using less. \n\nShould work. Then when your sister leaves, turn it back down again, if you want.\n\nNTA.", "NAH.  Your house, your rules.  I can understand your sister's anxiety having just had surgery but she's not working and waiting an hour for her shower is not going to hurt her.", "Sounds like you are both being a bit unreasonable", "NTA. She is staying with you. You have a life that comes with a schedule and have made clear to her that the one window of time she can't shower is during that block between your shower time and the water filter refilling. She can adapt around that schedule.", "NTA; you are already helping her out quite a bit. It's not sitting in her own filth to wait a bit to shower. Also, she can clean her surgical site with cold water.  How long does she have to wait? Assuming you shower at 9 for 15 minutes and she wakes up at 10, that means she only has to wait 15 minutes or so. Can you point that out and note it gives her time to fully wake up, brush her teeth, etc?\n\nThat being said... recovering from surgery is tough and frustrating, and I imagine it's even moreso when you aren't in your own house. Can you find a way to compromise, even a little? For example, ensuring you are out of the shower by 9:15 so she wouldn't have to wait long after she woke up? Could you shift your shower to 8:45? I know you like routine, but 15 minutes isn't a major adjustment, and so by the time she's up and moving, the water heater will have refilled? To be clear, you are already doing a lot and you aren't obligated to do anything more; however, if you let your sister move in for a bit, I assume you care for her, and it might make it easier to give her a little grace about being grumpy and try to find a solution. (However, if you were guilted into taking her and she doesn't normally treat you well, screw everything I said and ship her off to your parents.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m telling you this about myself so that you know I\u2019m credible when I say that she is absolutely full of shit. Changing her showering time by an hour is going to have little to no effect on her recovery (and the little effect that it may have will be largely mentally based, which isn\u2019t your job) \n\nNTA.", "NTA. If they want to side with her she can go live with them. If she\u2019s not happy she can go live with them.", "NTA\n\n> She\u2019s been complaining that I \u201cam making her sit in her own filth\u201d by making her wait and risking infection at her surgical site by refusing to change my shower time and that there\u2019s no concrete reason I couldn\u2019t adjust my schedule. \n\n\u2026yeah, this is bullshit.\n\n\u201cSitting in your own filth\u201d is a reference to sit in your own urine and feces, not waking up after sleeping.\n\nYou\u2019ve already given up a lot, and her shifting her schedule just means shifting her schedule - is does NOT mean asking her to do too much. (It\u2019s something she\u2019s already doing.)\n\nI also doubt waiting an hour to shower is going to risk an infection - especially if she maintains that schedule the next day, and the next.\n\nEven though you are helping her during her recovery, that is not a free pass to get everything she demands.", "Time to pack the ingrate up and have your parents tend to her since they have an opinion. NTA", "NTA.let her hire someone to come to her house and take care of her! Or stay with your parents", "NTA. If she doesn't like it she can stay with someone else. Waiting an hour to shower isn't gonna kill her", "NTA its your house and your already doing mych, don't change your schedule, ungrateful people", "NTA \nPerhaps your parents can take her to their place and take care of her.  (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s too far, so they can go to her place and take care of her).  You\u2019re  doing enough,  she needs to get up earlier or  shower later and zip it.", "and she can always have a colder shower. there is not a health risk for taking a less than hot shower\n\n\nNTA", "I figure it\u2019s either a power play, or severe anxiety.", "You assume that the OP's sister is cleaning her clothes/sheets.  \n\nMaybe a false assumption without the OP chiming in.", "Exactly! How would hospitals even run in that case? \n\nPlus a lot of patients can't take full showers frequently due to access/mobility/other health reasons.", "OP, I can see here that you are very concerned about her, and that you are a very good sibling...\n\nThat said, unless her wound has gotten in contact with contaminants that warrant immediate cleansing (dirt, etc.) you will not be putting your sister at risk by making her wait another hour. I had to get cut from chest to crotch, and I was perfectly fine with a daily shower at any time I felt like it. I recovered with absolutely no infection/complications whatsoever, and my scars healed in perfect shape. As long as she showers daily, uses the washing liquid the hospital gave her, and doesn't pick at the surgical site she will be A-okay.\n\nNTA.", "I did, but that\u2019s because the surgery was on my scalp so it was easier to get in the shower than to try to stick my head in the sink. For other wounds with stitches, I just use soap and water in the sink.", "Precisely. Someone needs to educate the sister.", "Well that makes sense, though I probably would have just dab-cleaned at that point lol.", "Does she shit the bed or something", "3% Hydrogen Peroxide takes 60-90 seconds to inactivate or kill most pathogens. Works better than most quaternary ammonium household cleaners.", "INFO:  Is there any reason to believe that there is something wrong besides the surgical wound? Something that would make her claims of \"sitting in her own filth\" and needing to immediately shower upon waking more reasonable than they sound right now? If no, then listen to all the NTAs. If yes, still NTA, you guys just need to have an awkward conversation.", "Wait a minute, wait a minute. INFO:\n\nWhy is she bathing so soon after a major surgery?\n\nAfter my open heart surgery I was instructed not to get the surgical site wet for at least a month and a half after surgery. I was sent home with bath sponges that you\u2019d wet and they\u2019d soap up and I\u2019d clean my body with those until that time had passed and washed my hair in the sink. This was because the incisions were closed with sutures that dissolved over time as the wound healed so that they didn\u2019t have to be removed later. I was under the impression that this was standard procedure for major surgeries. \n\nIf your sister has water-soluable stitches and she\u2019s bathing the area, she\u2019s going to set her recovery back by WEEKS if not MONTHS.", "NTA. Even in a hospital, they don't bathe that much. If she's that concerned about her own filth, get her wipes to wipe down in and clean up her wounds and stank. Nurses wouldn't change the schedule just because she whined about it. They have their own schedule and rounds to do. Her argument isn't realistic.", "NTA. It's literally not one tiny thing, it's one tiny thing and also the very big things of letting her stay in your home, moving your office to a closet, feeding her, helping her, driving her, etc. She's being ungrateful and entitled. If she's that worried about the surgical site she could wake up earlier, take a cold shower, or wash it in the sink.", " Well my solution is tell her she can move in with the parents since they\u2019re on her side and you get your office back and don\u2019t have to change your schedule!!  Your sister is so entitled that YOU have to change everything even though you are already doing so much for her??  You are NTA but everyone else certainly is!!  The situation is just ewww!!", "NTA your doing plenty, the next time your parents say something tell them they can have her stay with them instead if they have so many damn opinions. Is it not already a big inconvenience to be taking care of someone? Have you not already changed your whole damn life around? \n\nHonestly just don't put up with it and tell them if they don't like it you don't have to help her at all. Some people really don't deserve the kindness given to them. I would be so thankful if one of my family members did the things you are doing. I would be so worried about bein an incovienance and yet your sister is bitching at you cuz she doesn't want to wait an hour to take a shower?!", "NTA. If she so urgently needs a shower she can take a cold one. You're already going far out of your way for her needs.", "this! plus she shouldn't be washing her surgical site anyway! most surgeries require full healing of the skin/incision before it can be washed... in which case, she wouldn't need to be staying at your house, right?!", "I thought that you were often specifically told *not* to get surgical wounds completely wet in the shower or bath, in which case your method sounds better.", "Oh no! I meant if OP helps clean the sheets, sis can shower at night, and then there\u2019s no filth to sit in. \nBut the sheets have to be cleaned when the new routine starts.", "Water is not bacteriostatic. Anything that is frequently wet is probably home to say least a few (un/)friends, though they are harmless most of the time."]}
