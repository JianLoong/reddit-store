All day then you have an issue and really need to get landlord in order or just stomach the cost of repair.\n\nAs to wound cleaning, I am sure you have a kettle to heat up water. If not get one.", "Ultimately, NTA. \n\nI'm not sure what kind of surgery she had, but waiting an hour shouldn't make a major difference. For instance, we have patients that sleep shorter or longer time frames. If someone went to bed and got up one hour later, would they then have an infection from sleeping in for an extra hour?

Anybody who says \"it\u2019s just one tiny thing\u201d isn't looking at the whole list (feeding, housing, driving, mobility, office).  Your sister, who has had major surgery, is entitled to have poor perspective -- but should learn it quickly.  Your parents are the source of the problem here, because they should have told the sister she was being unreasonable.  Sister should get up earlier, get up later, find another method of washing, or something.  \"Sit in her own filth\" is pure manipulation.  Your parents should support you as a loving sister who is doing everything she can.  You should not be pushed in areas you care about as you've given up a *lot* as you're used to your own space.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re already doing enough to accomodate her. How hard is it for her to wake up sooner than usual? Does she just sit and let her surgical scars get dirty instead of using a rag to clean them?", "NTA\n\nbut I'd suggest figuring something out, regardless. Your sister is definitely being the asshole but if it's true that she is in recovery, her bathing schedule might be a bit more demanding than yours.\n\nYou say yourself that your schedule is flexible, and you have such a flexible schedule that you can have an entire block of time between your work hours. Yeah, routine is important and you're entitled to your routine in your own home, there's no question there, but how much do you value it over your sister's recovery? \n\nIt seems you might've only brought her in out of obligation, and now you feel rightfully burdened by it, and don't want to move another inch for her benefit. That's a little misguided in my opinion, and maybe even a little passive aggressive. Are you just refusing to budge out of some sense of regaining control and power over your apartment, or is this really that big of a deal for your schedule and routine?", "NTA - Her recovery does require her to get enough sleep, but that does not mean she needs to sleep until 10am. She could go to bed earlier and then wake up earlier. She can even take a nap after her shower.", "If you have access to the water heater, just go and turn up the temperature. Google how to do it if you have questions. \n\nThere will still be the same volume of hot water available but it will be hotter, so you can mix it with more cold water, thereby lowering the flow rate of the hot water, using less. \n\nShould work. Then when your sister leaves, turn it back down again, if you want.\n\nNTA.", "NAH.  Your house, your rules.  I can understand your sister's anxiety having just had surgery but she's not working and waiting an hour for her shower is not going to hurt her.", "Sounds like you are both being a bit unreasonable", "NTA. She is staying with you. You have a life that comes with a schedule and have made clear to her that the one window of time she can't shower is during that block between your shower time and the water filter refilling. She can adapt around that schedule.", "NTA; you are already helping her out quite a bit. It's not sitting in her own filth to wait a bit to shower. Also, she can clean her surgical site with cold water.  How long does she have to wait? Assuming you shower at 9 for 15 minutes and she wakes up at 10, that means she only has to wait 15 minutes or so. Can you point that out and note it gives her time to fully wake up, brush her teeth, etc?\n\nThat being said... recovering from surgery is tough and frustrating, and I imagine it's even moreso when you aren't in your own house. Can you find a way to compromise, even a little? For example, ensuring you are out of the shower by 9:15 so she wouldn't have to wait long after she woke up? Could you shift your shower to 8:45? I know you like routine, but 15 minutes isn't a major adjustment, and so by the time she's up and moving, the water heater will have refilled? To be clear, you are already doing a lot and you aren't obligated to do anything more; however, if you let your sister move in for a bit, I assume you care for her, and it might make it easier to give her a little grace about being grumpy and try to find a solution. (However, if you were guilted into taking her and she doesn't normally treat you well, screw everything I said and ship her off to your parents.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why can\u2019t she shower at night?", "NTA, it\u2019s not a big deal for her to wait for an hour. You already are doing a lot.", "Waiting an hour makes no difference.  She is pretending there is a medical reason to cry to parents. \nAlso if it's such a big deal she can shower a couple hours early.\nWould sister and parents do all this for OP if she required it?\nOr is this a golden child situation?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Beggars can't be choosers. She can wake up earlier or later but either way she should be more grateful.", "NTA but climb up the landlords ass to fix it. If this is a unit dedicated to your apartment, in like a mechanical closet, it sounds like you have a failing unit packed full of sediment and buildup. Ya may even be paying a higher power bill than normal because the unit cant reach and maintain an adequate reserve of hot water.\n\nEDIT: Take my advice about the landlord with a grain of salt, others have pointed out I may be slightly misinformed about the normal longevity of hot water in a standard water heater.", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019re being very accommodating in general and that she\u2019s trying to take advantage of that. If she\u2019s so concerned about her surgical site being clean, could you/she boil some water to clean it at 10am and follow up with a shower later?", "op=NTA\n\nit's not actually one little thing.\n\nand your suggestion is reasonable that she get up earlier--all she has to do is go to sleep earlier to compensate. \n\nTell Mom and Dad they are welcome to 1) fix your hot water issue 2) take her in.\n\nwhat they don't get to do is tell you how to live in your own home and conduct your own life.", "NAH, but do you really want her getting in the shower at 8:59a or 5 minutes prior to your workout ending?  That would meet your request and upset your schedule.  I do think it is reasonable for you to tell her either be in the shower by 8a. or wait until 11a.  I don't think waking having coffee and water, maybe breakfast before showering is dangerous to her infection site.  As long as it DOES get cleaned daily it makes no difference if it is at 10a everyday or 11a everyday.", "NTA.   If it's a 'tiny thing's then why are they complaining?", "NTA, sister can wake up sooner or later to shower", "NTA. You already made adjustments to accommodate her. I think she should go stay with your parents since they are all on the same wavelength.", "NTA", "She literally has any other time to shower, right? Before bed, noon, 2 pm etc? You\u2019re NTA but she is when she has no scheduling restrictions. If she continues I\u2019d see about other family members taking her in", "If the sheets are cleaned, she can shower before bed and she won\u2019t be sitting in her own filth either.", "[removed]", "15 minutes of hot water and then an hour to recharge sounds pretty standard to me for an apartment water heater.  That's about how long my hot water lasts and I'm in a house.  The only way to make it better is for landlord to either get a bigger water heater (there might not be room for one) or a expensive tankless one.", "I think OP is doing enough. This is a beggars choose beggars situation.", "I was thinking the very same thing!", "/u/Dirfvhmv is a bot that stole part of a comment from /u/InfiniteSlaps here /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108ekiy/aita_for_using_all_the_hot_water_in_my_own_home/j3rr1v1/", "Is that a thing? I only have a boiler and I'm in the same boat. I can only shower for like 15 minutes before the water gets instantly cold.", "Or why doesn't she shower at night?", "That's absolutely not normal. You'd probably want to have the unit looked at. I live in a house too. Mine is the average 30 gallon unit. If you only get 15 mins of hot water, then it may be severely filled with sediment either in the tank, on the elements or both. Even when I lived in an apartment and had those half height units, so probably less than what I have now, I had zero issues with hot water. I could take my 15-20 min shower and it would still be fine.", "It is! I can shower for an hour using hot water if I'd want to. Grew up with 4 siblings, it wouldve been a slaughter house with only 15 minutes hot water per hour", "Sorry to say, but I can shower indefinitely. Hot water 24/7. To add salt to the wound it's a rainfall shower and is utter bliss. Only issue is my kids. I have to take short showers because of them and can't stay in until I go all pruney.", "Do you have a low flow shower head?  We do have hard water here, but I have a gas water heater - so no element to worry about.  I did drain the tank last year and it was full of crap, but it's all gone now!  Showers have lasted about the same amount of time for me my entire life before the hot water goes out.", "You have a higher power heater, or warmer water from the mains\u2014 Assuming perfect efficiency, 30 gallons at a standard 1.8gpm restricted shower head gives lasts 16 minutes 40 seconds, and it takes 4542Whs to heat 30 gallons of water 60\u00b0F (ie from 50\u00b0 to 110\u00b0). That\u2019s 220V 20.6A for an hour. \n\nNow, you don\u2019t get the full 30 gallons, because the tank doesn\u2019t empty completely, so 15m of hot water sounds right, and you don\u2019t get perfect efficiency because the tank isn't perfectly insulated, so it sounds like a 220V 30A circuit, with a 22-24A heater (standard 80% draw) operating perfectly normally.", "Hmm, gotta look into this.\n\nThank you!", "Ya know what, it's possible i do. I don't think it states it on the head but the house was built in 2017 so it's likely that is the default used. I admit i might be a bit uninformed then.", "To be honest, I think I am far less educated on the topic than I thought. As stated in another reply, entirely possible i have a low flow head. Never actually checked. It's just whatever head the builder installed in 2017. I also dont take hot water only showers. I prefer the dial middle, leaning a tad hot, so that likely does cut down my hot water usage significantly .", "https://www.mieterbund.de/mietrecht/mietrecht-a-z/stichworte-zum-mietrecht-v/warmwasser.html\n\nThat should help you", "I don't need to hear her post-surgical instructions.
