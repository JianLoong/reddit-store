No one's business if you want to spend your share on one dish you're craving or if you'd rather get $10 mozzarella sticks and try some awesome cocktails.

Even if the bill was being split equally alcoholic drinks (depending on type and amount)would more than likely have been a comparable price or indeed added more onto the bill than your steak meal.  \n\nAny time I've been in a group setting, we've ordered what we want and paid our own costs of the meal and drinks, the exception being if it's a special occasion for someone. Then their meal costs are split between us and added to our own.", "NTA. I really don't get it. You paid your share plus tip.
