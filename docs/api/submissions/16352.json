Why keep toxic people around in your life, they sound **exhausting**!", "Umm... $475/9 (not charging birthday person) is about $53, split evenly your portion of the bill should have been $106, you chipped in $130, if anything you overpaid. NTA.", "NTA. We go out to dinner all the time as a group and never dictate what each other order. However I\u2019m the single mom of the group (which is usually my boyfriend and all his friends) and if someone orders a $70 meal or a $50 scotch I make sure to only hand over the money for my meal, drinks and tip. If everyone orders something reasonable I have no problem splitting it evenly", "NTA.\n\nAm I bad at math? Because it seems like you generously overpaid. Seems like your share including tip should have been around $95 - $100 unless sales tax is off the charts high where you are.\n\nThe only way you getting a steak could have offended a normal person would be if they now regret not getting the steak. But they each ordered and paid for items of their own choosing. You are not responsible for anyone else's choices or regrets.", "NTA. What a weird person. Their booze would have made their shares quite high. But even if they all had water it doesn\u2019t matter what you ordered when you paid. I would never go anywhere with that oaf again and I\u2019m not shy about letting folks know why.", "Wow. NTA. Bluey just wanted to show his @$$.\n\nPerhaps he fully expected the rest of the table to gang up on you or something.", "NTA, that kind of rule only applies when you all share the bill, ik which case you didn't. You paid for your own.", "NTA - this guy sounds like a complete turd", "This is what I\u2019m trying to figure out.  It\u2019s baffling. \n\nMy petty ass response would have been \u2018who\u2019s the asshole that cares what I choose to eat?\u2019", "I think they are just here to complain?  AITC? Yes!", "\"Was it only $43, I guess I paid too much then.\" and proceeds to take $50 back.", "Nah, that's showing no class.

It also sounds like Bluey is a miserable loser of a person who does nothing but complain and make things all about themselves.", "It worked in that I was able to avoid any awkward conversations about splitting the bill, or people only paying for what they ordered, when the bill came.\n\nI was able to play it off having a separate bill because I am always early to things anyway, so no one ever questioned it.  I got my separate bill, no one thought anything of it, everyone else got to split evenly (or however they wanted), and no awkward conversations had to happen.  It was win-win.\n\nEdited to add: Servers always knew about the open tab. They would come find me at the bar to let me know my party was there, and ask if I left a tab open.  When I said \"yes\", they said \"no problem\".  So the server and I knew, and it never came up when I was at the table.  In some cases, it was the host/hostess that would get me, adn they would let the server know.", "Has my choice of meal left you feeling blue?", "She shouldn't have gone in the first place.

What in the world? Where do you live that not splitting is the norm? Only time I've ever not defaulted to splitting is family. It isn't awkward, and if talking about money is awkward for you, I'd recommend you take a look at your financial situation, you're probably getting fleeced somewhere.", "Yes!", ">who I needed to distance myself from during that time\n\nPeople who like the color blue???\n\nI'm going to need you to show your work on this one", "Okay, so you probably are an AH. The social media post thing is just weird. not an AH for the steak situation though.", "I think it's safe to assume the post was about some kind of political opinion or something, and not literally about the colour blue", "Calling bullshit. Ten people had dinner at a place upscale enough to have \u201cfancy cheeses\u201d, the majority of the table got multiple alcoholic beverages, and the bill somehow was below $400?", "Best response evar.", "That\u2019s tasteless.  I\u2019m poor.  That hurt my feelings. Yta? Or me?", "Mine is yellow. I feel you.", "Is this a peasant joke I'm too rich to understand?", "Yes. She should turn him into a roach...", "My financials are fine, thanks.  And that is because I am careful with my money (e.g., not subsidizing other peoples' meals and alcohol when I was not making a lot back in the day).  Me doing what I did ensured that I did not get \"fleeced\".\n\nSplitting is a norm, but how you split is not always agreed upon.  Sometimes, people would spilt based on what each person orders.  But, most of the time, they would just split evenly.  So, even though my meal and drinks may have been like $20, I would end up paying way more.  \n\nNow, I am in a good financial spot and I don't mind splitting evenly.  Sometimes that means I pay more, sometimes it means I pay less.  It all works out in the end. With that said, I will speak up for people at dinners when their portion of the bill is significantly less than the rest of us. Someone once did that for me and it was much appreciated.", "No dog food for Victor tonight!", "A flea! A harmless little flea\u2026lol", "What is the rational behind splitting evenly? If a group was putting together their own party at a place and had decided on the menu ahead of time, even split makes sense. But at a restaurant where everyone will inherently get their own stuff at separate costs, it makes no sense to subsidize other people by evenly splitting, unless you're purposefully doing that.", "I can see that your scenario is more likely (I missed the word \"like\" in the post originally so didn't catch that this was an example).\n\nI will still say that it would have been easier for everyone (and less dodgy for OP) to just write \"anyone who likes [political figure/ thing] is an ass\" in the post. Like, at least make the actual theme clear bc posting that can be perfectly reasonable, but posting it about anyone who likes *one of the most commonly liked colors* ranges from annoying in a way that only sixth graders get a pass for to actively insane.", "So you\u2019re a Trump supporter and you were deliberately provoking a liberal?", "How do you read that she paid $130 of a $400 bill and assume that's all anyone contributed to tipping? Obviously other people also put in money for their meals and tips.", "How is that the OP problem they chose to get alcohol and then other food. Don\u2019t get alcohol and get a steak. They also said that people ordered Italian and seafood sooo that can also be pricey. Again not the OP fault at all", "They can't be that poor - they all had multiple alcholic drinks.  They just spend their money on booze and not food.", "It is easier to split evenly.  You don't have to itemize each thing, ask what people ordered, etc.  But, a lot of times, that can screw people over when they order cheaper food/drinks.  Back in the day, I was often the one being screwed over.  It was awkward to have to be the one person, in a large group, to say, \"hey, can we itemize?\", especially when the culture of the group was to spilt evenly.  That is why I came up with my tactic.\n\nThe reason I don't mind splitting evenly now is that my friends and I order roughly the same amount of stuff, and we can all afford it. In the event we don't order stuff of the same value, we don't worry about it.  The only exception would be if someone ordered something really pricey.  For example, I once went out with friends (a couple) who ordered a $300 bottle of wine.  When they ordered it, they made it clear, \"this is on us, but you are going to have some\".", "NTA.\n\nNext time ask for separate checks, or don't go out to dinner with assholes.", "What?? Where did you get that from??", "Yeah this is just a rant post about people they don't like.", "Yes like why are we going out for dinner at all if we can't have what we like?", "I feel discriminated against for the color of my hair.", "It was pineapple on pizza, wasn't it? That debate never fails to piss someone off.", "Why not just pay for what you ordered? \nIn the age of instant transfer it\u2019s a non issue if the restaurant doesn\u2019t split bills. \nIf you can\u2019t afford it and no one wants to shout you maybe you shouldn\u2019t be out to dinner? \nSpeaking as a poor person in their mid twenties", "NTA.
