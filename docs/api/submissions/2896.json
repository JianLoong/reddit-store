It's not for everyone.\n\nAdoption is not awful if both the birthparents and potential adoptive parents have gone through training on what to expect and receive support after the placement is made.

Open adoption can help both sides immensely.\n\n>My mom told me to stop being ridiculous, that suggesting adoption is insulting to a woman.\n\nThat is a really strange statement, but to me it's clear that the sister is not ready to even think about adoption.

It would be completely unfair to not deal with trauma from infertility and miscarriages and then use an adoptive child as a mere replacement. After the grief/trauma has been processed, it would be appropriate to apply for adoption.  But there are plenty of stories of families quickly adopting and then having that \"miracle\" baby with awful consequences for the adoptive children.", "As someone who struggles with infertility there are so many things you grieve. Everyone\u2019s journey is different. For me I first grieved the idea that I will never get to experience pregnancy, never get to feel the joy of seeing a positive result on a pregnancy test. Never get to tell my husband that we are pregnant. Never get to see what a mini version of me & my husband looks like. Then there was a whole other grief about how hard it is to even adopt, do ivf, or surrogacy. Everything is expensive so unless you are extremely wealthy you you have to pick one lane and hope it works out. Then there is the foster system. Which is amazing to adopt from but you are very unlikely to get a baby (at least where I am from). So there is a whole other grief around never getting to experience raising a baby, missing out on the first x amount of years of your child\u2019s life. So while yes adopting a child is amazing and something I hope to do at some point in my life someone choosing not to adopt is not the same as someone not want to be a parent. Infertility is a pain you cannot understand until you have been in those shoes.

When I started experiencing fertility issues, I immediately went towards the route of adoption. I would have preferred to adopt instead of pumping myself full of hormones. But, unfortunately, IVF was likely going to be cheaper and easier and, sure enough, $17k and 1 year later, I'm expecting my first in 5.5 weeks. Adoption generally costs north of $50k. \n\nI didn't need a child that had my DNA or grew in my uterus.

My family is very sweet and caring, but they can be ignorant about some of the harder aspects of adoption that they may not see in other family dynamics as you've listed. \n\nSome things can be a beautiful thing and very hard thing at the same time.

They said that anyone who could only ever see themselves loving someone (let's be charitable and assume a child before it gets too Sweet Home Alabama up in here) who they themselves conceived, is probably not the best fit to be a parent. Plenty of people are able and willing to love unconditionally and openly without strict expectations on said child to be a particular way, but may not be financially or mentally ready to deal with adoption, that is different. A potential parent who is already fixated on having their own child who is just like them is almost certainly getting into parenthood for the wrong reasons. \n\nThough I will say, taking on the responsibility of a child when there are doubts about your financial or psychological state is risky business. A lot can go wrong in your life, or a child's life, and the consequences for that kid if you fuck it up or can't handle it are catastrophic.

Adoption is great but it's not for everyone, and your sister is desperate to grow that life and carry that baby before becoming a mother.\n\nInfertility is cruel and unfair, it's caused mental illness in your sister and you've been incredibly callous. Show a bit of sensitivity.", "If she really wants to be a parent then adoption is great. It sounds like she wants to be pregnant. Even if she were able to, 36is considered a geriatric pregnancy. Comes with higher risks for both her and baby. But I think your sister really needs therapy to deal with it.", "I say NTA. My (now ex) SIL was like this. She and my brother tried to get pregnant and there were issues. My wife and I, on the other hand, had 2 right away. At every family gathering SIL would be upset about this. She would go to another room, still in view of everyone, and sulk. I asked my brother what is wrong and he aid \"she is upset she can't have kids\". She made sure everyone was informed of her woes. To be fair to SIL, this was not the only way in which she was an AH, but during those years she did all she could to try to make my wife and I feel guilty for having kids, and all she talked about was her inability. It made me not want to go to family gatherings. They did adopt, 2 infant boys. Well, her woes just changed from \"I can't have babies\" to \"I have 2 babies\". Everything was always about how she had it rougher than anyone else. So it gets tiring, to say the least. I agree that OP could have chosen different words, perhaps \"shut the f\\*\\*k up\".", "NTA I had four miscarriages and totally understand the heartbreak involved, but at some point you move on or do something different. She needed to hear those words.", "NTA. It's a reasonable suggestion for someone wo has been trying to have a kid for over 2 decades.  The sisters feeling were hurt because she wants a biological child.  Mom is just sensitive to her plight and whatever else is going on with her.  If she's saying things that are unintelligible to herself..then she needs some mental health care.  Either you will have to put up with hearing your sisters plight about not having a child are you are going to.have to go low contact with her.  There really is no way out because like your husband said, she is not well.  It does not seem like anyone is going to suggest therapy anytime soon.", "YTA. Adopting is an option for becoming a parent, but it is not a substitute for being pregnant. It is not good for either the children or the prospective parents to conflate the two issues.\n\nYour sister has trauma and situational depression around not being able to conceive and not being able to carry a pregnancy to term. An adoption cannot stick a bandaid over that wound. (And do you seriously think she'd make a good parent right now?! No. Babies are not accessories, emotional support objects, or fixes for all life's ills.) If she can get the mental health treatment she needs and get through that trauma then it might become an alternative route to parenthood, but the healing must come first. \n\nAnd your dismissiveness to her pain is uncaring to the point where you're passing into cruelty. That was badly done of you.", "I had fertility issues and would have loved to adopt. Seriously that is not offensive. It\u2019s harder than everyone thinks but your sister really needs someone to talk to about all this.", "Hopping on the top comment to clarify something. Most of you have stated some variation on 'adoption is extremely expensive'. Well, if you are trying to adopt healthy white newborns from teen moms who had an 'oops' then you are right.\n\nBut adopting a toddler or older child or sibling group through the state system is not. It is free. The child has free medical until 18, free in state public university education, though that may vary from state to state. There are varying degrees of post placement support in each state. If you adopt an infant from overseas, the only post adoption support you get is in the trenches with other international adopters.\n\nThe adoptive parents of children in the special needs category (being a sibling group that can't be split up is special needs) receive a monthly stipend until the child is 18. The amount varies from state to state. It is similar to a foster care monthly payment. \n\nThe stipend is an effort on the part of the fed to allow people that want to adopt but would struggle financially to have a little help. And it helps system children find a permanent placement rather than age out. \n\nAnd that is why I was and still am absolutely livid when the draft of the order overturning Roe v. Wade contained the disgusting statement that this \"would increase the supply of domestic infants\". I still get nauseous when I look at it. My feeling is not about politics; it is about not selling babies, it is about violating the rule of law in such a way that it feels like we are one perfect radical storm away from being used to breed babies \u00e1 la the handmaid's tale.", "Sorry, but i need to correct something here. It might not be rational, and obviously is some mental illness that needs therapy. But the feelings when you want a child and are unable to get one can lead to question yourself being a proper woman, your abilities in general and much more. This is pretty common. And i know its tiring to hear somebody grief over it for so long. But snapping at her and telling to just adobt is highly insensitive and an AH move. Its good for her that she was able to shake this off so easily, but that also means that she does absolutely not understand what her sister feels. Her husband is absolutely right with his statement.", "I understand what y\u2019all are saying but what OP was trying to get across is that if she were desiring to be a parent, she would\u2019ve attempted adoption. She wasn\u2019t trying to minimize her grief but trying to help her achieve her need to be a parent. The delivery was not the best which is why it was read wrong, but it wasn\u2019t her intention. I\u2019d go with NAH because she wasn\u2019t intentionally insulting her by suggesting adoption. Her sis is also clearly mentally ill and needs to go to therapy to process her grief.", "Yes I agree adoption should not be your last resort for becoming a parent", "That\u2019s a shitty and incredibly stupid assumption to make and adds nothing to the discussion. I\u2019m also infertile, but go off.", "I disagree. To me it sounds like OP was burnt out with hearing about her sister\u2019s journey and her \u201cjust adopt\u201d comment is abrupt and somewhat thoughtless. I do agree with many posters that her sister sounds like she needs a support group and counseling. \n\nThere are many, many barriers to even attempt to adopt. Some are controllable and some are not. \n\nAlso, not everyone wants to go down the adoption path for various reasons (traumatic to child and birth parents, many agencies exclude single parents and same sex couples, discomfort with navigating open and closed adoptions, not able to afford it as it costs 2-4 times as much as any fertility treatments). \n\nAlso, adopting through the foster care system is often even more complex because in that case it\u2019s not uncommon for the birth parent to (understandably) want to retain custody of the children and the court battles are very difficult. \n\nSaying just adopt isn\u2019t actually helpful in this scenario, it\u2019s dismissive.", "Many adoptees don't share your sentiment. That aside, it hasn't been 20 years, they're still of childbearing age. While sister definitely needs therapy that's not a question I had seen OP answer. Acknowledging the problem and asking to move on isn't tiptoeing around the issue, it's setting a boundary to try to help everyone enjoy their time together.", "Thank you for all your perspective! I\u2019ve seen a bunch of your comments here. I plan to adopt a child when I am ready (still have a ways to go working on myself and learning how to raise a child) and hearing your own experiences has been enlightening. Is there any space you recommend where I can hopefully learn more about adoptees experiences so that I can not make the same mistakes as other adoptive families and offer better support/be better prepared?", "I suppose she could try IVF if she is a good candidate for it and has the resources? Or perhaps surrogacy, although I find the ethics of it a bit iffy. \n\nBut adoption is not a family planning tool - particularly for people who are struggling mentally to come to terms with their infertility. In most cases, children are put up for adoption due to traumatic family events, lack of resources, etc. In a perfect world, if every child and parent was supported, there wouldn\u2019t be any children to adopt. People who want to, but are are unable to have biological children need to come to terms with the fact that you can\u2019t get everything you want in life.", "Congratulations on your first \ud83e\udd70", "Yup, I\u2019m sick to my back teeth of being considered a commodity. Very very few people are actually equipped with the empathy and skills required to be adoptive parents. Especially those making up for infertility pretty much never are."]}
