However, that was not helpful. There is no such thing as \"just\" adopt and for good reason, but that doesn't make the process any easier emotionally. Your sister is in a lot of pain and you completely dismissed it in a very unempathetic way.", "NTA. You're both infertile, so it's not like you don't understand to some degree what she's going through. It can be exhausting talking about and watching someone go through the same thing over and over again. Your comment wasn't wrong or inappropriate. If being a mother is what she wanted, she could adopt. However, your husband's right. Your sister's obviously mentally ill. It's almost like she's obsessed with the idea of pregnancy and birthing her own child rather than being a mother, which is likely why your adoption comment was \"hurtful.\" Also, your mother's an AH. Who tells their infertile daughter that \"suggesting adoption is insulting to women\"? That's probably part of why your sister keeps imploding her life in an attempt to have a baby.", "She does not need a baby. I\u2019d be scared for that child.", "NAH. I think it's a reasonable question and suggestion to make given the circumstance. But I think it goes deeper than that. Your sister needs therapy. This is the kind of desperate obsession that drives people to commit heinous crimes. I'm not saying this to be mean or presumptuous. I'm saying this because you need to have a long talk with her about what her obsession looks like and what it's costing her.", "No one has ever brought up the idea of adoption to your sister in 16 years?? Why would suggesting adoption be insulting in the first place? This is quite bizarre. I guess you could have said it in a more compassionate manner but NTA.", "NTA but honestly I don\u2019t think she should adopt because there is no way I would think an innocent child should be with someone like that. She needs mental health immediately.", "NAH. \n\nI think it\u2019s understandable that you snapped and said that. It\u2019s understandable that it upset her. \n\nI think it would appropriate to apologize for being insensitive and upsetting her, and then maybe see her a bit less of try to avoid the subject so you get her break from her drama.", "Gentle YTA\n\nMost of the YTAs forget that you do understand how she feels to an extent. Both if you have the same problem. \n\nBut you need to realise that first, your sister has to accept that she's not having biological kids. If she hasn't fully accepted it and made peace with it, she's not in the right mindframe to adopt. You need to apologise to her for how you said this because that wasn't the right way. \n\nShe likely needs therapy, time to process and to fully recover from this. Then she should consider what she wants and if adoption is the right path for her.\n\nYour mother is wrong BTW. There is nothing insulting about adopting. Adopting a child is giving a child a new chance at life, giving them love and care they otherwise were not getting. Women who adopt children and love and care for them as they would their own are truly admirable in my eyes.  The best kind actually \n\nAnd I also think your mother has a role in this unfortunately. Your sisters persistence for wanting a biological child and not considering adoption on her own, which people usually do, I wonder if mother expressed these backward views to her and doubled down on them.\n\n(Edited)", "YTA.

Your sister needs professional counseling, not to project all these issues into an innocent baby who's already gone through trauma.", "YTA. Adoption isn\u2019t some kind of one to one replacement for a bio kid. Treating it like that is disrespectful to the person you\u2019re suggesting it to, the child you\u2019re referring to, and their birth mother. Babies don\u2019t spring out of nowhere. There\u2019s going to be an entire set of connections that led to this child being born and the tragedy of having to give them up to be raised by another family. Ignoring that is just treating this kid like a commodity to plug a hole in a family. Treating the birth mom like a rent-a-womb. Unhealthy as fuck. \n\nShe was venting her pain, not asking for advice.

And from personal experience, it HURTS to see that word on your paperwork and then to miscarry only amplifies that pain. Your sister may need grief counseling to work through her pain. \n\nAdoption, however, is not a cure for that grief. You're TA for suggesting it to be her cure and for being ok with placing a child who very well may have trauma from their own circumstances with your traumatized sister. \n\nApologize to your sister.", "YTA. It was insensitive. You're her sister, someone she should be able to confide in.

Someone isn\u2019t less of a parent to their child because they didn\u2019t give birth to them. Giving a child a good home is not something to be ashamed of. \n\nSounds like your sister is more obsessed with the idea of being pregnant than being a parent. There\u2019s something deeper going on here \u2026 she\u2019s had 2 marriages fall apart due to her intense focus on wanting to get pregnant. That\u2019s not normal. I say this with kindness, but she should probably speak to a therapist or doctor about that.", "YTA.  Your sister was venting, not asking for solutions.  And presenting adoption as if it is an easy thing to do is also an asshole move, and largely inaccurate.", "Yta for talking to her like that when you know it's a sensitive topic for her", "YTA\n\nAdopting an infant is a difficult and costly process and it's not something someone just does. Plus, adoption isn't just a band-aid for people who are unable to conceive. This way of thinking does harm to children who are adopted.", "Eh, it is a sensitive subject.  I think adopting is an honest suggestion to make, but it's not the same as having your own and it should be suggested in a sensitive way, and not offered as an equal solution to not being able to have her own biological children. \n\nShe may have to accept that having a biological child or getting pregnant herself is unlikely, and that doesn't mean she will be childless forever - but considering adopting may only happen once she has fully accepted that she cannot carry a healthy baby to term on her own. Suggesting adopting like that as if her feelings are inconvenient, when you know she is still emotional about it and hasn't accepted it yet, is definitely an AH move. \n\nYou should have apologized for being insensitive at least. Not that adoption is a terrible suggestion. It's the way it was delivered I think.", "NTA.

I understand it must be challenging and devastating beyond my own comprehension. But it\u2019s become too much. You should be allowed to discuss a new family member without the conversation immediately switching to your sister and changing the tone from happy to sad and uncomfortable every freaking time.

You can say no or say its not something you want to discuss but you can\u2019t get mad that somebody brought it up.

The fact that you got over your fertility issues so easily should not be a reflection of how your sister feels.\n\nYour mom is being insulting to so many people with that sentence.
