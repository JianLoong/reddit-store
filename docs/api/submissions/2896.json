It's almost like she's obsessed with the idea of pregnancy and birthing her own child rather than being a mother, which is likely why your adoption comment was \"hurtful.\" Also, your mother's an AH.

My resources were finite, no guarantee either way, and I was over 40.  I decided on IVF with my last 3 frozen embryos.  If that didn\u2019t work, then I would be the best damn aunt in history.  I was extremely lucky and gave birth to a precious boy, now 17 yo.  I did go through some health scares during pregnancy, but I came through.  For me, the decision was rightfit me - not every other person.  If adoption doesn\u2019t feel right, DON\u2019T DO IT.

While I wish that everybody who wants children and would be good parents can have them easily and those that do not don't, biology does not work that way. It might be time to take a step back and look at her life right now.

Yeah, that couldn\u2019t ever end poorly for the baby in question. \n\nSome pertinent questions: How well do you think your sister would manage it if the baby decided to seek out their birth parents later? If they developed a relationship with the birth parents? Would she try to completely erase the baby\u2019s history and pretend that she birthed them? Could she be bothered to ensure that whatever agency she\u2019s using is 100% ethical? If she were to have a biological child after would she downgrade the adopted baby to second class? Adopting a child comes with its own unique set of challenges that are totally different from having a biological child. \n\nThe unique needs and challenges of adopted kids should be acknowledged and respected, not swept under the rug so that they can act as a cure of sorts for someone\u2019s infertility.

From your post it seems like you're not too fixated by children and perhaps had a more \"it would be nice if we had a child, but it's not the end all be all\" while your sister was a lot more focused on becoming a mother. Different attitudes towards children may have lead to different attitudes to infertility and I think that's something to keep in mind.", "YTA for how you phrased it.

I was honestly shocked at the amount of hoops and money involved. I realized very quickly that the chances of me being able to successfully go through that was not as high as I thought. \n\nThen I also read a lot of shit on adoption from the perspectives of adopted children and birth parents. There\u2019s a host of practical and ethical issues involved in adoption, *especially* since it\u2019s often treated as a consolation prize. \n\nThe TL;DR here is that even if your sister wanted a child who was not biological and didn\u2019t have all the mental and emotional baggage from her infertility, it would not be a simple and easy solution. Adoption can be its own years-long process with a lot of emotional ups and downs just like she\u2019s already faced with infertility. I get that you mean well, but your comments oversimplify something very complex and personal to her. \n\nShe needs therapy, and some help navigating the best way to come to terms with her situation or the ins and outs of whether and how being a mother is possible given her specific circumstances. Even if adoption turns out to be a viable and desirable option for her, she\u2019d also then need guidance on how best to approach parenting an adopted child in a way that is truly healthy and not traumatizing or treating the child as a band-aid. All of this can be incredibly overwhelming while also dealing with the emotions of years of infertility.", "Whenever adoption comes up on this page the top comments are always so ignorant. YTA. You do not just adopt a baby. If your sister has not felt drawn to adoption in 16 years of trying then it is not for her. Adoption isnt the back up card for infertile people. It's also extremely unhelpful to suggest it. Many women who face infertility have a very hard time accepting that the vision for their life is not going to happen. Consider yourself lucky you were able to move on so easily. She was likely venting to you and your mom because she felt safe in doing so and letting her true feelings out. And your reaction was cruel. You 100% owe her an apology.", "YTA - There's nothing wrong with adopting, if you're able. One, if she's currently single her chances are lower. Adoption also costs $25-$45k on average and your sister may not have that after any ivf attempts.\n\nIt was also just freaking insensitive.", "Adoption is not insulting at all. Adoption is a gift to many parents. What your sister wants is not to be a mother but to be a mother to a biological child. And it looks like that isn't going to happen.

Adoption is traumatic for kids and in most cases bio parents would want to keep their kids if they had support/resources they needed. In many cases it\u2019s really quite awful, really more of human trafficking! Legal guardianship is at least a better option in the extreme cases of there being no bio family or next kin available, because it at least doesn\u2019t permanently alter birth certificate, erasing child\u2019s access to own medical info and potential connection to ancestors/culture.
