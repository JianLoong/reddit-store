It's not for everyone.\n\nAdoption is not awful if both the birthparents and potential adoptive parents have gone through training on what to expect and receive support after the placement is made.

Open adoption can help both sides immensely.\n\n>My mom told me to stop being ridiculous, that suggesting adoption is insulting to a woman.\n\nThat is a really strange statement, but to me it's clear that the sister is not ready to even think about adoption.

It would be completely unfair to not deal with trauma from infertility and miscarriages and then use an adoptive child as a mere replacement. After the grief/trauma has been processed, it would be appropriate to apply for adoption.  But there are plenty of stories of families quickly adopting and then having that \"miracle\" baby with awful consequences for the adoptive children.", "As someone who struggles with infertility there are so many things you grieve. Everyone\u2019s journey is different. For me I first grieved the idea that I will never get to experience pregnancy, never get to feel the joy of seeing a positive result on a pregnancy test. Never get to tell my husband that we are pregnant. Never get to see what a mini version of me & my husband looks like. Then there was a whole other grief about how hard it is to even adopt, do ivf, or surrogacy. Everything is expensive so unless you are extremely wealthy you you have to pick one lane and hope it works out. Then there is the foster system. Which is amazing to adopt from but you are very unlikely to get a baby (at least where I am from). So there is a whole other grief around never getting to experience raising a baby, missing out on the first x amount of years of your child\u2019s life. So while yes adopting a child is amazing and something I hope to do at some point in my life someone choosing not to adopt is not the same as someone not want to be a parent. Infertility is a pain you cannot understand until you have been in those shoes.

When I started experiencing fertility issues, I immediately went towards the route of adoption. I would have preferred to adopt instead of pumping myself full of hormones. But, unfortunately, IVF was likely going to be cheaper and easier and, sure enough, $17k and 1 year later, I'm expecting my first in 5.5 weeks. Adoption generally costs north of $50k. \n\nI didn't need a child that had my DNA or grew in my uterus.

My family is very sweet and caring, but they can be ignorant about some of the harder aspects of adoption that they may not see in other family dynamics as you've listed. \n\nSome things can be a beautiful thing and very hard thing at the same time.

They said that anyone who could only ever see themselves loving someone (let's be charitable and assume a child before it gets too Sweet Home Alabama up in here) who they themselves conceived, is probably not the best fit to be a parent. Plenty of people are able and willing to love unconditionally and openly without strict expectations on said child to be a particular way, but may not be financially or mentally ready to deal with adoption, that is different. A potential parent who is already fixated on having their own child who is just like them is almost certainly getting into parenthood for the wrong reasons. \n\nThough I will say, taking on the responsibility of a child when there are doubts about your financial or psychological state is risky business. A lot can go wrong in your life, or a child's life, and the consequences for that kid if you fuck it up or can't handle it are catastrophic.

People who aren\u2019t adopted either thing it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world, or that the adoptive parents are saints who can do nothing wrong, and their children should be thankful every day that they were \u201csaved\u201d. Both of these thoughts are SO belittling to adoptees and it only causes most of us more trauma that we don\u2019t need.", "> Adoption is a beautiful thing and something very needed in this world. \n\nNo it is not. Or it very very frequently isn't. look up adoptee voices. Adoption causes immense trauma to a lot of kids.", "I hate the \u201csavior\u201d BS that people think of. It can and often does cause real and lasting harm. Please don\u2019t continue to think this way.", "Congrats on being adopted\u2026? \n\nCongrats to you for being born I guess.", "i mean she did have two miscarriages it's not an unexpected touchy subject and op even mentions it in the post", "A large percentage of the kids in foster care are removed for \"neglect\", which is actually just poverty, that could be easily remedies by given their bio family the money they're going to give to the foster family for their care.", "Think what way?? My parents adopted my older sister and are lovely wonderful people and parents. They never absconded her when they had us other kids on accident. They were planning on my sister being their only child. It\u2019s very sad that people have bad experiences and obviously the \u201cadoption industry\u201d has MAJOR MAJOR issues and I\u2019m not disputing that,  and I don\u2019t think people who adopt are \u201csaviors\u201d. I\u2019ve just seen a lot of people VERY against it and it\u2019s like.. okay get rid of adoption and then have EVERYONE in orphanages where they don\u2019t get enough attention or in foster homes? In MYY personal life experiences foster homes are awful places according to my friends who have been in them. Hence my comment.", "Just go to BabyMart and pick one out!", "Adoptee here and yeah, people think this. It\u2019s either \u201cjust adopt\u201d as if it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world, or \u201cYou are an Angel from heaven for adopting these poor, needy, kids. They\u2019d be no where without you, you are their savior\u201d. \n\nIt sucks and I wish people would realize that adoptees are not objects, we aren\u2019t political pawns, we are human beings who deserve the same respect any other person would get.", "One of my sons was exposed to cocaine, tobacco, heroin and pot in utero. He was born on heroin, which was used to induce labor. The other is has ADHD, was hypersensitive, and had anxiety and processing issues. Both had birthmothers who were addicted to drugs and were bipolar. We had no idea what the future would hold when we took these babies home. There is no such thing as the \"best circumstances\" when adopting. That is why you educate yourself and build a support system.", "I\u2019m glad your parents are lovely and good parents. \n\nBut while you say you don\u2019t believe in the \u201csavior\u201d part\u2026 what you say after kind of disputes your claim that you don\u2019t believe in the \u201csavior\u201d part. \n\nAdoptees hear all of this, quite often. This can cause increased trauma. Increased negative thoughts. And worst of all, it can put our safety at risk. \n\nBtw I\u2019m not fully against adoption, I think there are certain circumstances where it\u2019s the best option that can be made.", "\ud83d\udcaf i was looking at adoption as well since I had Infertility issues and ever since I was a kid I wanted to adopt too. Researching adoption, it's incredibly expensive, not guaranteed, emotional and i feel like a popularity contest with newborn young moms picking families to Me. International adoption is even more expensive! IVF was the easiest  and most viable option route for me and I have my son now from it.", "It\u2019s probably the type of adoption or specific agency you went through. I know plenty of adoptees who\u2019s parents were older than that, and I was never raised with any religion. I\u2019m an adoptee btw.", "True that. Often even when it doesn\u2019t seem to be in kid\u2019s best interest.  My friend had a two year old foster child go back to birth parents even though she documented all the bruises he came back with on every visit weekend. She never planned to adopt, but was heartbroken for the little boy.", "As a fellow adoptee you took the words out of my mouth. Thank you", "\u2026 first we need to reform the fucked up system we have. Too many people are able to adopt when they shouldn\u2019t be and this results in a shit ton of trauma for the innocent kid.", "Idk where you are getting the danger and savior thing from with my comments but I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve obviously had bad experiences.", "I hope you have other adoptee friends IRL, or at least on line. If not, I can PM you some recommendations. Sadly this isn\u2019t the place that adoptees can get a lot of support.", "2 marriages", "And here\u2019s the angry adoptee trope\u2026 \n\nYou said \u201cokay get rid of adoptions and then have everyone in orphanages where they don\u2019t get enough attention or in foster homes\u201d \n\nHere is the saviorism I\u2019m talking about. \n\nWhat happens when an adoptee becomes depressed and still has those internalized thoughts? I\u2019ll tell you. They think to themselves \u201cWhy are you depressed? You have nothing to be sad about, you could be in an orphanage. You\u2019re so fucking ungrateful. Those kids have something to be sad about. You don\u2019t. Those kids would be grateful and wouldn\u2019t be depressed if they were adopted. You\u2019re ungrateful and worth nothing. You are worthless\u201d. \n\nWhat happens when there\u2019s abuse in the home and adoptees try to speak out and get help? People would be less likely to believe them. Their parents saved those kids from a life in an orphanage! How can it be that they are abusive? No way. So that adoptee keeps getting abused because no one believes that adoptive parents who \u201csaved\u201d that child from an orphanage could ever do anything wrong. \n\n\nThese aren\u2019t my stories. But i know too many adoptees who do go through this.", "I would love to get some recs from you. I don\u2019t know anyone else that\u2019s adopted and it\u2019s\u2026tough.", "Well I\u2019m sorry to hear that your friends or whoever have been though that but I more so meant as in if orphanages and foster homes are the ONLY option it doesn\u2019t seem much better.\nI\u2019m not trying to defend shitty people here or shitty parents.", "For sure.\n\nThanks for sharing. It's always nice when someone can see and/or relate to a perspective that's not really talked about much :)"]}
