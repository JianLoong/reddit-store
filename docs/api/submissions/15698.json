I\u2019ve worked hard and poured as much money into this as I can. We do everything from plumbing, electrical, woodwork, etc. and everybody gets trained in a little bit of everything just to build knowledge and incase of emergencies where we need more hands. Flash forward to 2 weekends ago and my mom asked me if I could get my brother Tom (19m) a job at my company to help him get off his feet. I agreed but set ground rules that he doesn\u2019t get a free paycheck and will work for his money and put in the same amount of effort as the rest of my guys/girls. They both agreed and Monday morning he showed up and put in a good days work. This lasted until Wednesday and then I got a call from my mom telling me I need to reprimand my employee Jeff, Jeff is a phenomenal worker and is amazing at what he does. He caught my brother on his phone at a job site multiple times and after multiple warnings yelled at Tom. I told my mom I trust Jeff as he is my best employee who id trust fully with my company and Tom needs to learn to stay off his phone and work or he can quit. My mom frustrated, yelled and hung up on me. We had a family get together Friday night and Tom lashed out for giving him \u201cthe hardest role out of everybody just so I could see him struggle. You make me carry all of the heavy equipment and supplies while you sit on your phone\u201d. I snapped back that he doesn\u2019t know hard work and struggling and that he\u2019s just a lazy guy who can\u2019t stand working and if he doesn\u2019t like it so much he can leave. He stormed out and my mom starting flipping out and my dad stopped her and reminded her all the work I\u2019ve put in and that it\u2019s my company I\u2019ll run it how I want. After that I excused myself and went home. I\u2018ve been receiving angry texts from my mom and my brother hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. He\u2019s been showing up to work and actually has been working harder but keeps his head down. Sorry for any mistakes and bad writing, this is why I do construction.

Period. Honestly your mom is being ridiculous by expecting you to cater to your brother just because he's related to you. If he isn't going to put in the work, he should be held accountable. If he doesn't like that, then like you said, he can quit.", "NTA. You're doing him a favor treating him like any other employee. That's how he'll learn how to work and not rely on family for everything. \n\nMaybe construction isn't for him, this is his chance to find out.", "NTA. This is why it is not always wise to work with family. \n\nYour Mom's interference may be the biggest problem here. Her berating you for not protecting her baby gives your brother the impression you are not the authority at work. If you give in to this, it proves your brother right and every time he doesn't like the job he will cry to Mom. The real world doesn't work that way. \n\nIt will be harder for your brother to gain respect at the work place purely because he is your brother, but if you take it easy on him or they catch wind that he tells on you to Mommy, there will be even less respect, and less for you if you give in or defend him when he does something wrong at work. People really don't respect nepotism for a reason.", "NTA. You build a company from the ground up, have certain standards to hold and explained as much to your family. \n\nYour brother probably was expecting an easy ride and a no work paycheck. \n\nIf he wants to act like that then he can go find a job elsewhere. You are doing him a HUGE favor by allowing him to work for you. \n\nGlad to hear that he's keeping his head down and working harder. Maybe he actually got the point that this isn't a free ride and if he doesn't want to do the job, you'll hire someone who actually does. \n\nCongrats on running a successful business OP!", "A lot of guys when they start out think they\u2019ll be doing interesting stuff on day one. My experience has been that the hands are there to do the stuff that takes time away from the pros. Do it long enough and you\u2019ll know what\u2019s needed. Once you know what\u2019s needed you start to know why. Once you know why, *then* you start learning how. I think people who are really interested in a subject do it naturally. When it\u2019s just a job, that process tends to work better when spelled out explicitly. I\u2019d ask him what he wants to do. Does he want to apprentice, or does he want set responsibilities and well defined expectations?", "NTA- He prolly deserved a wake up call. If Mom don't like it then she can hire him.", "NTA. He will thank you someday.", "NTA, Nepotism got him the job but he thinks it should also get him the paycheck. This scenario is just one reason why people say never mix money and family.", "NTA You are teaching your brother about the real world, something your mother neglected to do. Why do m9thers baby their sons and try to keep them dependent? So.sad. But he is working for the past few days so maybe he is learning from you what your parents didn't teach him. Well.done.", "Nta, talk to him and understand that since he's new he might have to do a little more to learn, but he needs to prove himself, and it's better to do it with a family company then a random company who doesn't have his well being at heart, if he doesn't want to hear it then cut him loose and let him grow on his own.", "NTA. I think if he truly was given the same treatment and work as every other employee you hire, then you\u2019re definitely NTA. Your brother seems like he\u2019s a bit entitled, and could definitely use a little more honest hard work.", "NTA, your brother is complaining about a job you gave him, and he and your mom knew that he wasn't getting special treatment if he was hired and needed to work for his pay.", "If your mom wants him to get a paycheck for doing nothing just tell her to pay him herself while he sits on the couch.", "NTA. He's lazy and a safety hazard. Sounds like he was expecting an easy ride.", "NTA - You could have handled it with a bit more grace, but your mom is so far out of line you deserve a pass for snapping. Hopefully your brother is keeping his head down and working because that's what you do as the new guy on the job.\n\nAlso, I assume he's carrying the heavy stuff because he's 19 and doesn't know how to do the more skilled work? If this is brought up again, I'd calmly ask which tasks you should be assigning to him. Electrical? Plumbing? Finish carpentry?", "NTA, and what you said clearly worked.", "NTA\n\nyou said that if you gave him a job he\u2019d be expected to work like all the other employees. You gave him a job and now he\u2019s having to work like all the other employees. There is no justification whatsoever for his and you mum\u2019s objections. \n\nAnd on a side note you need to hold your ground on this for the sake of your business. From what you\u2019ve said a good part of your business\u2019s success is down to having a well trained and hard working team working for you and good experienced people like Jeff keeping things running smoothly. If you allowed your brother to swan about the place getting paid for doing less than they do and acting like he was too good to do the work they do, then you would lose their respect and good will. That would damage your business (as well as being just plain wrong). \nYour team will appreciate seeing you play this fair and you won\u2019t hold their loyalty or respect if you don\u2019t carry on doing that.", "NTA this is how it works in this industry (in any industry, really. This one is just more physically demanding than most). You do grunt work until you learn the skills you need to do the mote complicated work. Even then, it's damn hard work. If your brother just wants to sit around on his phone all day while everyone around him busts their asses, he should find another job. I don't even work in the industry but my wife is a GC with about 30 years experience under her belt. Even as a spouse, you need how hard it is and how important it is to be on top of completing the job.", "NTA. If your brother is calling mommy. Instead of staying off the phone. He's not ready for a job. Get rid of him before you lose any good workers.", "NTA", "NTA. Just read an article that says those born after 1997 are the WORST employees. Your brother is coddled by your mom and that\u2019s why he\u2019s a whining wimp.", "YTA - Jeff may be lazy, and he obviously needs to stay off his phone and put in the work, but your own words paint a picture about you being more worried about everybody knowing you're the boss than you are about whether your brother was actually being lazy, or struggling with a greater workload.\n\n\\*Edit - Your brother may be lazy, not Jeff.

Also, using your phone and not maintaining good situational awareness on a construction site is an injury waiting to happen.", "NTA-  he thought he'd have it easy ; surprise!!", "NTA", "NTA. He's an employee, a new one, and he has to learn how to behave in your company. If he's never worked before, he also is learning what construction work is actually like. Even if he does not stay with your company, it'll be good for him, because every job adds to his knowledge.\n\nTell your mother to stop babying her now-adult son: that's definitely bad for him. And tell your brother men don't complain to their mommies about job difficulties, they talk to their supervisor.", "NTA, Hank Rearden (couldn't resist).", "NTA bur this is a prime example of why you shouldn't mix business with family. Tom needs to find his own job.", "NTA. I did not expect him to put more efforts into work at the end of your story. Maybe there is hope for him though your mom is not helping with her attitude.", "NTA: you probably did him a favor. He\u2019s learning how to work for his money and learning work ethics, good on you!!", "NTA - you already told him he wouldn't be getting any favours due to him being your brother. He needs to show some gratitude and stop having pity parties. Just do the job, get paid, end of story....like everyone else!", "NTA Everyone starts with grunt work in construction. I don't know what he was expecting.", "NTA, giving him the job was a favour and your sign of courtesy to your mom and brother. But working and being disciplined enough to keep it is something your brother needs to earn. \nThey can\u2019t compare where you are today after so many years and so much work you have put in. Your mom and brother need to know that you had a much different start than your brother has at 18; no one gave you a free pass and entry into a business like you did for him! \n\nTrust your instinct and gut, that\u2019s what got you so far in work and that\u2019s what your employees depend on.", "NTA\n\nIf you treat him differently than the rest of the guys, they're going to resent him, and that will cause chaos in your company.

Ask him what he thinks you do for a living, what he thinks he'd be doing if he got a job anywhere else and what he expected from working for you?\n\nTell him the special treatment was you hiring him in the first place. That all your employees have done this, that you did this. You don't expect him to be perfect right off the bat but you do expect him to try, and ask for help if he's unsure about things. If he's untrained then having him as an assistant is the best start.\n\nSince he likes being on his phone so much if you think you can trust him to man the reception desk/take calls for appointments/organising files maybe he could try that if he's unhappy with the field work.", "NTA - if I read this right, you started this business at 18, a year younger than Tom and built it from the ground up.

You can't learn if you don't even know what the supplies are, who needs them, for what, and ... where they are stored in the first place.  Sounds like the brother is trying to suck it up, but mommy is holding him back because he's obviously \"her baby\" and can't function in thy world as a 19yo.

This is your business and it's a tough job. Tom is upset because he actually has to work for his paycheck just like any of your other employees. Tom and mom obviously didn't think you were serious about him be treated like any other employee which is why mom though she could call you to complain about Jeff. Glad your dad stepped in to remind them all that this is your business and you are teaching him to be a professional at work.

Tell him you want to see him succeed and the best way to do this is for him to learn how to graft. \nYou're his big brother, he naturally respects you and wants you to think well of him, so use that.\n\nYour brother isn't really an AH, he sounds like every early 20s kid I've worked with, they test boundaries and you correct them - what they do after determines whether they are worth keeping around.\nYour mother on the other hand... she needs to cut the apron strings. I would refuse to talk about work with her and tell her that's between you and your brother. If he gets on the same page she'll leave it alone eventually.", "Obviously you're NTA, but I think you should probably sit down with your brother and set expectations. Call him into your office and just explain how things work, what he can expect, how people do things, etc. Ask if he's still interested.", "Nope NTA at all , sir you have my respect \ud83e\udee1 such a young age and having a complete sense of responsibility , I admire you. As for your brother and mother sir they are TA . Your mother should be grateful that you found a job for your brother, also Gen Z or not there\u2019s no place for a phone in construction while working if there is no emergency. \nAlso he knew what company you have , you told him that he is going to work not stay on his phone. The decision is his, work or quit , this will make him either man up or complain. But please don\u2019t blame yourself because he is being sensitive", "NTA your mom and brother wanted him to get an easy paycheck not how it works.", "Why is your mother calling her son\u2019s boss (you)? He\u2019s a grown up. If your brother has a problem, he needs to speak up. No more family meetings about his job, \ud83d\ude44. You are NTA. Manage him the way you would any other new employee and don\u2019t discuss it with your mother.", "NTA. Your mother is though.", "Yep. My first job was at age 14 in an arcade. My father was the general manager and did all the hiring. He told me straight up that I'm getting the job because I'm his son, but it's going to be up to me to keep it. It sounds like Tom is in the same boat. His older brother gave him the job because of the blood relationship and now it's up to Tom to keep the job.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "Holy crap.  He's 19.  He is an adult.  If he has an issue with someone,  he needs to grow up and speak to that person instead of crying to his mommy.  This is probably the worst way to handle an issue with either your sibling or your boss.  If my 19 year old employee's mom called me to say I'm too rough on him, I'd fire him on the spot."]}
