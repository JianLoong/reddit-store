Each person grieves differently and it is NOT up to them to give you a timeline OR to help BY STEALING things that are YOURS!\n\nHere is something that may give you comfort:\n\n\"Before I begin, this post is not seeking sympathy. It is merely trying to shed a little light on the total weirdness and unpredictability of grief. Those who have experienced deep loss already know. But for those who have not:\n\n\r  \nI washed the orange cup today. \n\n\r  \n'The orange cup' is not a metaphor. It\u2019s a small, plastic cup\u2014one of several in a multicolored set. It is perfect for the bathroom sink. It\u2019s just big enough for a sip of water in the middle of the night, or to wash down daily meds. I had not washed it since before January 1st. Before you get too grossed out, I had not used it either. You see, that little orange cup is the last thing in the house that Mark\u2019s lips touched on January 1st, before he was loaded into an ambulance, never to return. \n\n\r  \nI had picked up the orange cup several times before, thinking it was time to wash it and put it away. But each time it wasn\u2019t. I would hug that little cup, cry a little (or a lot), and return it to the counter next to the sink. It wasn\u2019t time to wash it\u2014until today. \n\n\r  \nToday, I washed the cup.\n\n\r  \nWhen my mother died, her house coat (bath robe) was hanging on the back of the door in the bathroom. When my Dad died 5 years later, it still hung in the same spot. He had given away or tossed a lot of Mom\u2019s items, but just not that house coat. Had he lived another 10 years, I think it may still have been there\u2026 or maybe not.\n\n\r  \nDeep, profound grief is just weird. So, keep that in mind when you wonder why grieving people do (or don\u2019t do) what you think they should do, or what seems normal. Grief is really weird. They\u2019re just not ready to wash the cup.\"\r  \n\\#LoveWhatMatters \r  \nCredit: Amy Boardman Rejmer", "NTA. Make sure to change the locks.

Do they expect you to get rid of absolutely everything? \n\nI don't think the \"good intentions\" on your relatives' part should matter. They are not helping you, and if they're stealing from you, certainly you'd see them as untrustworthy.\n\nIf you worry you might be wrong in how you're dealing with things, I would speak to a counselor/therapist (if you're not already). \n\nAll the best to you.", "NTA - This makes my blood boil. They stole from you, who has already lost so much. I couldn\u2019t ever trust them in my home again.\n\nLet me make this clear. They did not do this because they want to \u201chelp you heal.\u201d I think anyone with two brain cells and a heart could recognize that *stealing your husband\u2019s things* would have the opposite effect. They are simply uncomfortable with your grief. They want you to never mention your husband again and act like he never existed, either because they\u2019ve never experienced a major loss and so don\u2019t know how to deal with someone who has, or because they don\u2019t know how to deal with their own feelings, so real and *healthy* mourning/remembrance makes no sense to them.\n\nThis is how my extended family reacted only months\u2014*months*\u2014after my brother died.

Everybody grieves in their own way. People move forward in their own way and in their own time.  I had listened to a Ted talk, where the young lady said that you don't move on from this, you move forward. Your husband will always be a part of you and your daughter. His passing, though painful, will shape you who you become. 2021 was not that long ago to have lost your spouse.\n\nThe fact that anybody would go into your house and steal from you thinking it will make it better, are selfish, and have done nothing but made it worse. Maybe there's a reason you're holding on to some of the stuff. Maybe it's stuff you choose to pass onto your daughter or even hold onto for your own sentimental value. Maybe you're just not ready to move forward without those items.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with cutting contact from these family members. You are still healing and grieving.

You show great insight and resilience just in this post and I think you're doing a great job of navigating the complicated layers of grief in a way that is right for you. There is no one \"right\" way to grieve. I think though, that when we watch a loved one grieve, it impacts us in tricky ways that we might not even be aware of. I would venture a guess and say that they are having a hard time not being able to alleviate your pain as you reel from this loss, and by removing his things to \"help you\" is also their way of alleviating their feelings of helplessness. This does NOT validate what they are doing or imply that it is at all appropriate, but if these behaviors are out of character for them, I would say that they are flailing in response to this very difficult and traumatic loss that they are watching you go through. That being said, his items are yours to preserve and protect and the timeline for when you make changes in that context is also yours. Grief is just love with nowhere to go, and often folks keep items around for a long time to give a tangible nature to something very large and powerful but seemingly unseen.

None of us were prepared for her to be gone, she was in perfect health, and then had a brain aneurysm on her smoke break at work. \n\nThe first thing my friend did was pack all her stuff. She had the house fully decorated, very maximalist and slight hoarder house. Everything was packed within a week. Even most of the dishes she loved have been packed up. Everything is set to be donated or thrown away, except certain collections that he\u2019s going to use to make a hang out area with her memories. He didn\u2019t want the house to remind him of her everywhere he looked. \n\nThe only thing he can\u2019t take down is two of her rosaries.

I kept a lot of her clothes, and wear them all the time. He\u2019s okay with that, but couldn\u2019t look at them hanging up anymore.

But she lost the most significant person to her and she wasn't ready to pack him away. Other people pack everything up or move. Everyone has a different process. She had grief counseling. I think it depends on whether you're going to an unhealthy place or not. Get help, join a group. You are going through one of the hardest things.

Putting his jewellery and pocket items in a memory chest, having his clothes made into quilts for you and your daughter, maybe getting items framed? They're wrong to try to take these items, you just need to find a way to keep them as treasures, rather than in their old places.", "NTA at all. NC is the way here. This was a horrible invasion of your life and so beyond disrespectful.", "Nta It's laughable and horrible that they think stealing his stuff is going to keep you from being reminded of him. You have his and your child in the house, I would imagine that would be the biggest reminder you could have.\n\nMy girls were 13 and 15 when my dh passed. Keeping home consistent was important for them. It gave them a sense of security and stability while coping with this life altering loss. Over time, they began putting things away and changing things around. It just happened naturally.\n\nYour family seems to think there is a fast path through grief. There isn't. You have to feel all the pain, sadness, rage. .. You just take it one step at a time.  Eventually you will get through .", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and that your family is treating you this way. It\u2019s not ok for others to force you to move on or even process your grief differently than what feels right for you (and your kid). \n\nI have found the book \u201cIt\u2019s OK that you\u2019re not OK\u201d by Megan Devine to be really helpful. Both for my own grief and for supporting others in theirs. She has a podcast and insta too. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to hurt, to be devastated, to feel anguish and grief, and to miss your husband. It\u2019s ok to hold on to his things, the life you built together, and your memories of him.", "NTA. My jaw dropped when you said they took his ring.", "NTA. \n\nThey stole from you. Their reason is irrelevant. What they did is theft. They\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t press charges.", "Seriously? Wtf were they thinking? Do not try to police somebody else\u2019s grief. As long as you were not neglecting your daughter, there\u2019s nothing wrong with finding comfort in your late husband\u2019s possessions and going NC seems entirely reasonable in the short term. NTA.", "They way I audibly said \"oh my god\" and my jaw dropped when you said THEY TOOK HIS RING!? I would have lost it. I am so sorry this has happened to you. \n\nAlso, it's not like it's been 10 years and you haven't changed a thing?? It really hasn't been that long. I mean what the hell?? \n\nNTA not at all.", "Nope, MAJOR boundary broken here!! I agree with others, change the locks and go no contact. Who knows if they took stuff you still don't know about? Total control freaks. And one of my newest friends just lost her husband of 30 years to a heart attack, only a few years ago. She talks about him like he's still around and still wears his wedding ring, says it comforts her. We are all fine about it.", "NTA. This behavior is not coming from a place of love. Your family is uncomfortable with your behavior. \n You are actually handling it very well.  You are owning your grief. No one has the right to tell you how to get through it. Besides, it hasn't been that long at all. \n You do what you have to and need to do. \nSo sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nThe thing that got me was his ring. That\u2019s for your use and whatever you want with it. My dad died when I was 19 and I had worn other rings of his long before he died on necklaces. He died of bone cancer. And when we knew he was dying, he gave me his wedding ring. I wore it on necklaces until I got married myself and I got it resized to be my own wedding ring. \n\nJust a thought, keep it for your own daughter to wear when she grows up. I super don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m telling you what to do, just saying what meant a lot to me. Keep your head up, and do things at your own pace. If items in your house are not causing a detriment, they can stay. I remember my mom going through this. It was really hard.", "You are definitely NTA. Who are they to tell you how to grieve. I would go batshit crazy if any of my family did something like that to me. I've lost my mother, my father, my brother and my sister -- all unexpectedly. I still have many things from each of them. It took me 15 years before I could talk about my mother without crying. \n\nMy sister died two years ago, and until recently, I kept two bags of her clothes, her hospital bag and her photo albums in a corner of my bedroom. I still have a storage with her furniture (she lived in an apartment) and decorations. I still have my brother's ties, my father's coats and Guayabera shirts, and my mother's coat, jewelry, cast iron cookware and her molcajete (which I had to fight a cousin to get back after her mom passed -- I let my aunt use the with the stipulation that it comes back to me when she passes). \n\nGirl, you do you. No one has the right to tell you how to grieve or when to let things go. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "Nta. I lost my mom in November of 2021. I lived with here and I didn't move much of anything until Jan of this year. Take the time you need to heal. \nI'm very sorry for your loss.", "NTA! I lost my father while in high school and my\nMother lost the love of her life. For a while it felt like my heart would explode if anyone touched or took his things. People always nagged us to get rid of his stuff but why? This was his home for 20+ years and our family base for longer. One day my mom went absolutely nuts and tossed everything he had. Me and my sister broke down all over again bc my mom took it upon herself in a mental breakdown to toss it all out. After she healed, she realized how fucking dumb she was for doing so and regretted it completely. Me and my sister were hurt. Even though we are grown adults his stuff being gone creates a hole in our hearts. \n\nYour child is so young and can benefit from the items of her father. The things he loved, the hobbies he enjoyed, the clothes he wore over and over again are reminders for you and your daughter of his great life. Based off my experience I implore you to keep these items so she can know who her dad was for the rest of time and for you to always have a piece of him with you and for your home to not forget what an impact he had. Wish you the best in your healing \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "Holy sht. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. They\u2019re being incredibly cruel to you and I hope you\u2019re getting the support you need, if not from them.", "NTA. What they did was theft. There's no set time for grieving, and even if they're concerned, this is a shitty way to go about showing that concern.", "When my bird died, it was 3 years before I moved her cage.", "That's the pure truth...", "So grateful you posted this. My mom passed away gently in my arms after she stopped breathing 27 hours prior - the same day she came home after 35 days in the hospital. My soul needed this.", "I have family that lost their youngest daughter at 19 almost 15 years ago. Her bedroom sat untouched until it flooded in 2019. The belongings they were able to salvage still sit in boxes in that room. It brings her mom so much comfort to sit in there and be surrounded by her things. Do others grieve differently and need to let go of those physical reminders? Absolutely. But there are also those, like my cousin, who are comforted by them instead. And neither way is wrong. We all grieve differently, and you should do what\u2019s best for you - not what others think is best for you.", "I still have my mom's cell phone number saved in my contacts. Even though she died 4 years ago and I'm ok now, I just can't bring myself to delete it. It feels like erasing the contact is erasing her. Rationally, I know it's not...but I just can't do it.\n\nShe would send a card for every holiday. I'd just toss them because I can't really save a half dozen greeting cards each year, y'know? I didn't really think about it until one day I was going through a pile of papers that I kept stacking up instead of filing properly (I'm soooo bad about that)...and mixed in that stack was a card from my mom. It had been over a year since she died when I found it, but I just sat down and cried like it happened yesterday. Still have that card. It's nothing special, no note written in it or anything, just \"Love, Dad & Mom\" in her handwriting. But it was from her, she picked all her cards out specially for the person she was giving it to, then she signed it and sent it to me. Damn I miss her.", "Right?! Of all the things to keep, the wedding ring is one of the most common things someone will keep after losing their spouse/partner, even if it\u2019s just wearing it on a chain or keeping it on a jewelry stand. None of the stuff they did and took was ok, but the wedding ring? Seriously? It\u2019s not like she was hanging on to something gross or possibly harmful, like a used tissue or rusty old razor blade. It was a perfectly normal wedding ring for her husband she lost less than two years ago. Hopefully she can focus on her kid and healing now that she doesn\u2019t have worry about her family stealing"]}
