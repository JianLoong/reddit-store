Each person grieves differently and it is NOT up to them to give you a timeline OR to help BY STEALING things that are YOURS!\n\nHere is something that may give you comfort:\n\n\"Before I begin, this post is not seeking sympathy. It is merely trying to shed a little light on the total weirdness and unpredictability of grief. Those who have experienced deep loss already know. But for those who have not:\n\n\r  \nI washed the orange cup today. \n\n\r  \n'The orange cup' is not a metaphor. It\u2019s a small, plastic cup\u2014one of several in a multicolored set. It is perfect for the bathroom sink. It\u2019s just big enough for a sip of water in the middle of the night, or to wash down daily meds. I had not washed it since before January 1st. Before you get too grossed out, I had not used it either. You see, that little orange cup is the last thing in the house that Mark\u2019s lips touched on January 1st, before he was loaded into an ambulance, never to return. \n\n\r  \nI had picked up the orange cup several times before, thinking it was time to wash it and put it away. But each time it wasn\u2019t. I would hug that little cup, cry a little (or a lot), and return it to the counter next to the sink. It wasn\u2019t time to wash it\u2014until today. \n\n\r  \nToday, I washed the cup.\n\n\r  \nWhen my mother died, her house coat (bath robe) was hanging on the back of the door in the bathroom. When my Dad died 5 years later, it still hung in the same spot. He had given away or tossed a lot of Mom\u2019s items, but just not that house coat. Had he lived another 10 years, I think it may still have been there\u2026 or maybe not.\n\n\r  \nDeep, profound grief is just weird. So, keep that in mind when you wonder why grieving people do (or don\u2019t do) what you think they should do, or what seems normal. Grief is really weird. They\u2019re just not ready to wash the cup.\"\r  \n\\#LoveWhatMatters \r  \nCredit: Amy Boardman Rejmer", "NTA. Make sure to change the locks.

Do they expect you to get rid of absolutely everything? \n\nI don't think the \"good intentions\" on your relatives' part should matter. They are not helping you, and if they're stealing from you, certainly you'd see them as untrustworthy.\n\nIf you worry you might be wrong in how you're dealing with things, I would speak to a counselor/therapist (if you're not already). \n\nAll the best to you.", "NTA - This makes my blood boil. They stole from you, who has already lost so much. I couldn\u2019t ever trust them in my home again.\n\nLet me make this clear. They did not do this because they want to \u201chelp you heal.\u201d I think anyone with two brain cells and a heart could recognize that *stealing your husband\u2019s things* would have the opposite effect. They are simply uncomfortable with your grief. They want you to never mention your husband again and act like he never existed, either because they\u2019ve never experienced a major loss and so don\u2019t know how to deal with someone who has, or because they don\u2019t know how to deal with their own feelings, so real and *healthy* mourning/remembrance makes no sense to them.\n\nThis is how my extended family reacted only months\u2014*months*\u2014after my brother died.

Everybody grieves in their own way. People move forward in their own way and in their own time.  I had listened to a Ted talk, where the young lady said that you don't move on from this, you move forward. Your husband will always be a part of you and your daughter. His passing, though painful, will shape you who you become. 2021 was not that long ago to have lost your spouse.\n\nThe fact that anybody would go into your house and steal from you thinking it will make it better, are selfish, and have done nothing but made it worse. Maybe there's a reason you're holding on to some of the stuff. Maybe it's stuff you choose to pass onto your daughter or even hold onto for your own sentimental value. Maybe you're just not ready to move forward without those items.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with cutting contact from these family members. You are still healing and grieving.

You show great insight and resilience just in this post and I think you're doing a great job of navigating the complicated layers of grief in a way that is right for you. There is no one \"right\" way to grieve. I think though, that when we watch a loved one grieve, it impacts us in tricky ways that we might not even be aware of. I would venture a guess and say that they are having a hard time not being able to alleviate your pain as you reel from this loss, and by removing his things to \"help you\" is also their way of alleviating their feelings of helplessness. This does NOT validate what they are doing or imply that it is at all appropriate, but if these behaviors are out of character for them, I would say that they are flailing in response to this very difficult and traumatic loss that they are watching you go through. That being said, his items are yours to preserve and protect and the timeline for when you make changes in that context is also yours. Grief is just love with nowhere to go, and often folks keep items around for a long time to give a tangible nature to something very large and powerful but seemingly unseen.

None of us were prepared for her to be gone, she was in perfect health, and then had a brain aneurysm on her smoke break at work. \n\nThe first thing my friend did was pack all her stuff. She had the house fully decorated, very maximalist and slight hoarder house. Everything was packed within a week. Even most of the dishes she loved have been packed up. Everything is set to be donated or thrown away, except certain collections that he\u2019s going to use to make a hang out area with her memories. He didn\u2019t want the house to remind him of her everywhere he looked. \n\nThe only thing he can\u2019t take down is two of her rosaries.

I kept a lot of her clothes, and wear them all the time. He\u2019s okay with that, but couldn\u2019t look at them hanging up anymore.

But she lost the most significant person to her and she wasn't ready to pack him away. Other people pack everything up or move. Everyone has a different process. She had grief counseling. I think it depends on whether you're going to an unhealthy place or not. Get help, join a group. You are going through one of the hardest things.

And for those who are saying it comes from a place of love oh it absolutely does not. it comes from a place of control and \"I know best\". None of that is love. Everyone grieves differently you're doing fine. They have absolutely no right to invalidate your feelings or alter your house or steal your possessions. In time when you're ready you may wish to discard some things such as clothes or less important objects. But that should absolutely be on your timeline no one else's. And to take the ring that's abhorrent. That is something any widow would want to keep forever. And they have absolutely no right to invalidate your feelings or make you feel less than because they think you should be doing things differently. Stay strong. be good to your kid. take your time. and I'm sorry for your loss, I can only imagine how hard that is. If distancing yourself indefinitely because they are being completely unsupportive and irrational is what you need to do for you and your family then that is exactly what you should be doing. Good luck and my sympathies.", "Stealing his ring????", "People generally want people to move on because watching someone grieve is hard, lots of people have un-done personal work so they slop their feelings onto the grieving person instead of working them out. \n\nYou need to move on usually means I want you to stop making me feel.", "NTA, they were probably stealing things to sell. Because no sane, rational, or caring person would take your husband's ring! Tell them that they have 24 hours to return anything and everything that they \"forgot\" to return. And after that, if you discover anything missing you will report them for theft. If they complain about this, then they have already sold things. Change your locks and tell your relatives and their social circles above it. I am so sorry for your loss, you are grieving in a normal manner and timeframe. The fact that they took the ring is beyond the pale and very suspicious.", "NTA. We all deal with grief differently. And very gently, I want to suggest that their behaviour is not coming from a place of love. It\u2019s coming from a place of judgement. I\u2019m sure they love you and care about you. The love leads them to want to take action. The judgement leads to the choice of action and the lack of respect.", "NTA at all and I applaud you for cutting them out of your life.... everyone processes death differently and I also know people who kept most if not all of their husband/wife's belongings. I can't believe they even took his ring the top item that people who lose their loved ones keep... My grandma kept my grandpa's wedding ring after he passed away last year from lung cancer.", "NTA, people grieve in different ways. them forcing the issue like that is actually making it far worse. you have to work through your terms, there may come a day when you say \"I don't need that here\" but it will fall to you to say what and when.", "Absolutely NTA.  Grief is a path everyone walks in their own way and it takes a long time.  You are entitled to keep his things as long as you want and need to.  I would suggest that you help yourself by taking occasional breaks.  For example, take your daughter somewhere for the weekend and stay in a hotel.  There you will not be surrounded by any of your family possessions.  It may actually give you a sense of relief and possibly your daughter too.  And you'll know that everything is back at home waiting and will be there when you get there (don't give your family a key to your home, take away any you've given them).  Eventually, instead of getting rid of his things, put a few things in boxes or folded in suitcases.  Just a few.  If you want them out again you can take them out.  Don't rush it.  Also if you haven't already try to find one or more groups for people who have lost spouses, or lost loved ones in general.  This can give you some confidence that what you are doing is not uncommon (you can find a lot of books online too if there are no groups near you).  Maybe your family was trying to help, maybe they've never lost anyone but it seems excessive to me.  NC for a while is fine.  Let them back in slowly and only those who can respect your boundaries.", "NTA at all! Holy shit this is just a huge overstep. Its only been 2 years, you lost your husband and the father of your child, your kid lost their father. There isnt only one way to grieve.", "My father died 14 yrs ago.  It took me 3 years to be able to fully function other than work to pay bills.  My husband had to do anything that required leaving the house except for work.  I couldn't even think of going through his things for another 2 years.  Now, I take a small pile at a time and go through it - more because it just seems too tiring to do it all at once.\n\nThere is no set time frame, no set process.  It is your grieving process and time frame.  I'm so sorry for your loss, and tell anyone who thinks \"it's time\" to do anything you aren't ready for the s*&$% it.", "OP, do change the locks.  You don't want these people in your house.", "NTA. My mother passed in 2020 due to cancer and my house is pretty much the same. Some things have been moved or switched out due to them being old and worn out but we still have many things that belonged to her. Your family sucks, keep them blocked for a while and maybe see a therapist... this is the best advice I can give and I have been given and a therapist for your daughter as well, maybe.", "As I said in a earlier comment, English is not my strongest language, if there are any errors or weird sentences that is why.", "[removed]", "My uncle/godfather died 13 years ago this year. I still have at least one of his Toronto Fire Department t-shirts (he was a firefighter). It's perfect as a sleep shirt and I like to think it's how he can still hug me from heaven.", "28 years since I lost my dad, and I still have his jacket, a sweatshirt (a Christmas gift from me), and his U.S. navel cap, the white one like Popeye wore. It will be ten years this summer that the love of my life died; still have two shirts and every note he ever wrote me. Just knowing these items are in my home helps me feel closer to them, even if I rarely take them out. \n\nOP, there is *no wrong way to grieve.* You need to do what\u2019s best for you and your child, and if that is keeping your husband\u2019s things for two more months or two more years, do it. You\u2019ll know if and when the time is right.", "I have three saved voicemails from my dad.  I have listened to them, and they give me comfort to know that they're there.\n\nThere is no wrong way to grieve.  You block who you need to and take care of yourself and your child.", "Try \u201cI have one child\u201d", "u/Lanky-Yogurtcloset78 is a bot.

Your response to his loss is normal and you're working through your grief. I've never heard of such a cruel response to a family member losing someone before. I hope you can heal at your own pace without being weirdly belittled by your family.\n\nRewording bot version:\n\n>Her reaction to this is twisted and confused.
