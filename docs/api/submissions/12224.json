Each person grieves differently and it is NOT up to them to give you a timeline OR to help BY STEALING things that are YOURS!\n\nHere is something that may give you comfort:\n\n\"Before I begin, this post is not seeking sympathy. It is merely trying to shed a little light on the total weirdness and unpredictability of grief. Those who have experienced deep loss already know. But for those who have not:\n\n\r  \nI washed the orange cup today. \n\n\r  \n'The orange cup' is not a metaphor. It\u2019s a small, plastic cup\u2014one of several in a multicolored set. It is perfect for the bathroom sink. It\u2019s just big enough for a sip of water in the middle of the night, or to wash down daily meds. I had not washed it since before January 1st. Before you get too grossed out, I had not used it either. You see, that little orange cup is the last thing in the house that Mark\u2019s lips touched on January 1st, before he was loaded into an ambulance, never to return. \n\n\r  \nI had picked up the orange cup several times before, thinking it was time to wash it and put it away. But each time it wasn\u2019t. I would hug that little cup, cry a little (or a lot), and return it to the counter next to the sink. It wasn\u2019t time to wash it\u2014until today. \n\n\r  \nToday, I washed the cup.\n\n\r  \nWhen my mother died, her house coat (bath robe) was hanging on the back of the door in the bathroom. When my Dad died 5 years later, it still hung in the same spot. He had given away or tossed a lot of Mom\u2019s items, but just not that house coat. Had he lived another 10 years, I think it may still have been there\u2026 or maybe not.\n\n\r  \nDeep, profound grief is just weird. So, keep that in mind when you wonder why grieving people do (or don\u2019t do) what you think they should do, or what seems normal. Grief is really weird. They\u2019re just not ready to wash the cup.\"\r  \n\\#LoveWhatMatters \r  \nCredit: Amy Boardman Rejmer", "NTA. Make sure to change the locks.

Do they expect you to get rid of absolutely everything? \n\nI don't think the \"good intentions\" on your relatives' part should matter. They are not helping you, and if they're stealing from you, certainly you'd see them as untrustworthy.\n\nIf you worry you might be wrong in how you're dealing with things, I would speak to a counselor/therapist (if you're not already). \n\nAll the best to you.", "NTA - This makes my blood boil. They stole from you, who has already lost so much. I couldn\u2019t ever trust them in my home again.\n\nLet me make this clear. They did not do this because they want to \u201chelp you heal.\u201d I think anyone with two brain cells and a heart could recognize that *stealing your husband\u2019s things* would have the opposite effect. They are simply uncomfortable with your grief. They want you to never mention your husband again and act like he never existed, either because they\u2019ve never experienced a major loss and so don\u2019t know how to deal with someone who has, or because they don\u2019t know how to deal with their own feelings, so real and *healthy* mourning/remembrance makes no sense to them.\n\nThis is how my extended family reacted only months\u2014*months*\u2014after my brother died. They wanted the grief to be over and talking about him suddenly became a taboo.

Everybody grieves in their own way. People move forward in their own way and in their own time.  I had listened to a Ted talk, where the young lady said that you don't move on from this, you move forward. Your husband will always be a part of you and your daughter. His passing, though painful, will shape you who you become. 2021 was not that long ago to have lost your spouse.\n\nThe fact that anybody would go into your house and steal from you thinking it will make it better, are selfish, and have done nothing but made it worse. Maybe there's a reason you're holding on to some of the stuff. Maybe it's stuff you choose to pass onto your daughter or even hold onto for your own sentimental value. Maybe you're just not ready to move forward without those items.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with cutting contact from these family members. You are still healing and grieving.

You show great insight and resilience just in this post and I think you're doing a great job of navigating the complicated layers of grief in a way that is right for you. There is no one \"right\" way to grieve. I think though, that when we watch a loved one grieve, it impacts us in tricky ways that we might not even be aware of. I would venture a guess and say that they are having a hard time not being able to alleviate your pain as you reel from this loss, and by removing his things to \"help you\" is also their way of alleviating their feelings of helplessness. This does NOT validate what they are doing or imply that it is at all appropriate, but if these behaviors are out of character for them, I would say that they are flailing in response to this very difficult and traumatic loss that they are watching you go through. That being said, his items are yours to preserve and protect and the timeline for when you make changes in that context is also yours. Grief is just love with nowhere to go, and often folks keep items around for a long time to give a tangible nature to something very large and powerful but seemingly unseen.

His daughter might want to wear it if/when she gets married. OP might want to wear it for a long time yet!", "Well they took some pictures, some more jewelry the ones I usually wear but I don\u2019t wear it to work cause I don\u2019t want it getting ruined, some of his playing cards he had in a stack and some of his figures, most of this stuff is around the house.", "If it makes you feel any better, I couldn\u2019t even empty the trash on my husband\u2019s side of the bed after he died.
