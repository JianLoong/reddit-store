Before my youngest, I had given birth to my angel baby, who lived 8 minutes and was born premature. My 6 year old was born with Down syndrome, and a heart defect. She needed multiple surgeries at birth, but now is thriving. I know you guys are probably thinking why would I have another baby after this, but it really wasn\u2019t planned. \n\nMy mother has said since the beginning of my pregnancy about termination, how I\u2019m too old, how something certainly will be wrong with this baby as well. It was stressful, and heart wrenching; my husband talked to me how I shouldn\u2019t tell her when I was going into labor because she would make it stressful for me. 9 days ago, I gave birth to my healthy baby girl at the age of 44, no health issues. After I came home and rested for a few days I had invited my mother over. When she got there she began to cry, and said she couldn\u2019t believe I would exclude her. I told her I had no other choice, that she wasn\u2019t a healthy person to be around for my pregnancy.\n\nShe accused me of silencing her \u201cfreedom of speech,\u201d and how she was only warning me and not setting me up for heartbreak. I said no, you made me worry more then I needed too. She then said I did this out of revenge and vindictiveness, and not for my own sake but for my own satisfaction. We got into an argument and my husband ended up asking her to leave. I\u2019ve been upset for days now, she hasn\u2019t answered any of my calls.

You have a right to your life and decisions without feeling unsupported by your mom and she has a right to be upset with you because instead of communicating you left her out and made her feel less than.

Your mother is acting like you made it your personal effort to wound her feelings over this whole matter when that was not your intention in the slightest.\n\nEveryone deals with grief differently. Some want to talk their heart out about it and get things off their chest. Some internalize their feelings because they\u2019re not comfortable talking about the subject, feel like they don\u2019t have proper support, etc. I know that when I experienced a loss before my current it broke my heart and left me very anxious, to the point where I had to go on anxiety medication when I got pregnant again because I was scared I would lose this one too.\n\nStay strong, maintain your boundaries, and don\u2019t feel guilty.

You have an amazing husband and a wonderful family with your children. Maybe it's time to let go of the wishful thinking about your mother and spend your energy on the people who love and need you the most. \n\nIf your mother does the work on herself, if she sincerely apologizes and knows why she was in the wrong, and if she doesn't demand that you bend over backwards to win her back, maybe then you can let her back into your life... Slowly and with firm boundaries in place. But you don't need to swallow her mistreatment or let someone who treats you badly around you and your family. Know that you're better off without her if she stays the way she is. \n\nCongratulations on the beautiful new addition to your family.

Instead of telling your mom you got all the tests and the baby is fine, or having an honest conversation that she is freaking you out and you need her to do x, y, and z for you, you took the 'easy' way out, and now your relationship with her is going to have a great, big, giant, *unfixable* dent in it from now on. \n\nYou already mention being the 'unfavored' child, and now your mom thinks you excluded her for petty, vindictive reasons. That's the sort of person she thinks you are. \n\nSo, while I get the need and the impulse to avoid her, you might find the avoidance has now become permanent, and you really should have seen that coming.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry to say that any pregnancy is 'rolling the dice with a human being's life', that's just how it works. Health isn't guaranteed. Happiness is definitely not guaranteed. Most of us don't even know if we have it in us to be good parents until we're in the thick of it. We try our best for a good outcome but humanity continues because people go on taking risks on the behalf of the next generation who cannot consent to that. It's not for any of us to judge the quality or value of someone else's life from the start they get, either.\n\nBeing older during the pregnancy does increase risk factors but so do a lot of things and we simply don't restrict pregnancy to only the best candidates because that's the start of a dark road to go down. It's not even possible to say that OP's pregnancies turned out the way they did because of her age. Sometimes these things just happen to anyone. Statistics are not facts on the level of the individual.\n\nBirth control can fail, sometimes repeatedly. The thing about having abortion access is that taking advantage of it is still a free choice. It's not a choice everyone would want to make in every situation, and in OP's case her higher-risk pregnancy was probably monitored closely and she would have been choosing to abort a child that was, as far as she knew, healthy. Most people in the pro-choice camp have made up their mind about what a fetus is or isn't but the truth is we don't know.\n\nThe ageism surrounding pregnancy online is crazy sometimes but I guess in your teens and twenties someone in their forties seems practically in the grave already...", "This is the exact point I was trying to make, thank you.\n\nIt's got nothing to do with being albist, I am personally disabled. I now have 2 children but I did the genetic testing when I was pregnant and if it was clear they had a high chance of having significant health issues, we would have terminated.\n\nHaving children is intrinsically selfish, and the quality of life is objectively less so for someone with a disability, which I can say first hand.\n\nId rather not have a child, or terminate so my child knew nothing but the love and warmth while I carried them, then have to exist in this world because of my selfishness.\n\nAs parents it's our duty to provide the best for our kids, it is our choice to bring them into this world after all, they don't ask to be born.", "Tons of people have children with intellectual and physical disabilities and handle a newborn perfectly. Also what does a disabled child have to do with this? Are you seriously suggesting we should abort babies that could potentially be disabled? I'm disabled and that's a really shitty thing to say.

I have a condition that makes me sweat excessively from my hands and my feet (got it from my mom but she just had it on her face) and it's made my life a living hell, so much so that I got a surgery done that's banned in several countries bc of potential side effects, in order to get my hands to stop sweating so I could actually be a vet and live a mostly normal life. It can't be compared to something like CF but it's affected me so much that I will never have children, because making someone go through that would be even worse than going through it myself. Your kids have an awesome parent!", "aww thank you, I'm sure I'm failing them in ways but I am doing my best, and I'm definitely going to make sure they get whatever support needed throughout their life.\n\nThe reason I think these posts piss me off so much is that in an ideal world I would love to have lots of kids, more than 2 for sure, but that's not the reality I live in, and they couldn't have the absolute best life I can provide if we have more than 2, so we've stopped. Even got the snip.

I can't write on paper often unless the aircon is so high that I'm cold, and even when it's winter and I'm cold overall my hands and pits can still be sweaty, it is a nightmare.\n\nHere I know you can get Botox/surgery for it in your hands and armpits which I will do for my kids if I find out I've passed that down to them.", "I think a lot of people forget that you have to provide for them emotionally as well as financially, and having more than 2-3 is just not feasible unless you're able to spend enough time investing in them all emotionally.

Mine was so bad I had constant fungal infections on my feet, and dishydrotic eczema (blisters) all over my hands and i even got some on my face which hasn't even been recorded as a possibility. If I was anxious (which I often am) the sweat would drip from my hands like a leaking faucet. It was truly debilitating and made me fear social situations. Couldn't put on gloves, couldn't use the fingerprint pad at my university library, for the longest time I couldn't have a phone without destroying it but luckily they're waterproof now... those are just off the top of my head.
