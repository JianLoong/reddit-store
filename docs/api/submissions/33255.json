We have 4 children together, ages 20, 17, and 6, and a newborn. this might be kind of long and rambling I\u2019m very upset so here it goes. My apologies. Before my youngest, I had given birth to my angel baby, who lived 8 minutes and was born premature. My 6 year old was born with Down syndrome, and a heart defect. She needed multiple surgeries at birth, but now is thriving. I know you guys are probably thinking why would I have another baby after this, but it really wasn\u2019t planned. \n\nMy mother has said since the beginning of my pregnancy about termination, how I\u2019m too old, how something certainly will be wrong with this baby as well. It was stressful, and heart wrenching; my husband talked to me how I shouldn\u2019t tell her when I was going into labor because she would make it stressful for me. 9 days ago, I gave birth to my healthy baby girl at the age of 44, no health issues. After I came home and rested for a few days I had invited my mother over. When she got there she began to cry, and said she couldn\u2019t believe I would exclude her. I told her I had no other choice, that she wasn\u2019t a healthy person to be around for my pregnancy.\n\nShe accused me of silencing her \u201cfreedom of speech,\u201d and how she was only warning me and not setting me up for heartbreak. I said no, you made me worry more then I needed too. She then said I did this out of revenge and vindictiveness, and not for my own sake but for my own satisfaction. We got into an argument and my husband ended up asking her to leave. I\u2019ve been upset for days now, she hasn\u2019t answered any of my calls. I really thought I was doing the right thing for myself but now I feel selfish.

She knew she was pushing buttons and she was out of line.  She is only hoping that you will knuckle under and apologize to her, thereby rationalizing her bad behavior.  Look, having a baby is literally one of the most vulnerable times in a woman's life.  You should be surrounding yourself with support and help and love.  She can have all of her hurt feelings, but you are not in the wrong.  Consider treading carefully here in the future, she may be as vindictive as she thinks you are...", "NTA\n\nCongratulations on a healthy baby girl! Your Mother's reaction to seeing you'd had such a fortunate and wonderful event was to cry for herself; she seems so very nice. It's a shame you seem so desperately inclined to believe that she will magically change her mind about how she feels about you, one day. Your husband seems to be willing and able to protect you, and he seems to adore you, and you have a terrific family; why do you let someone so destructive play any role in your life?", "NTA\n\nYou were absolutely doing the right thing for your own sake and the sake of your baby. The last thing you needed is to be stressed out while in labor and it sounds like she'd have caused a lot of it.\n\nCongratulations on your little girl. I'm so glad she's healthy.", "NTA. Why is it more common for AHs to use free speech as an excuse for their bad behavior?", "NTA. Sounds like you need some distance from your mom. Also, someone should explain to your mom that freedom of speech is a protection from the government and not individuals", "You did the right thing for your child... she did not do the right thing for hers", "NTA\n\nYour mom is completely out of line; she\u2019s making your sane, smart decision to protect yourself and your child into a soap opera all about her being the victim. Classic attempt at gaslighting. \n\nI would stop calling her. She is the one who should feel guilty. She owes you a huge apology. You don\u2019t need that kind of bullshit in your life.", "NTA I lost a baby and I\u2019m currently 23 weeks pregnant and still haven\u2019t told my parents because they put their grief on me last time.

Congratulations on your healthy live birth \ud83e\ude75", "NTA.   Your baby your decision.  You did not curtail her freedom of speech, she said what she said, it's just that she doesn't like the consequences.  You were right to keep the stress and toxicity at bay until afterwards.", "NTA.

You are a grown adult, who is married, with four children. You should have implemented strong boundaries with your mom from the start. Hiding your labour from your mother and not letting her see the child for a few days would make her think you did this out of vindictiveness and for revenge. Unfortunately, your lack of demanding respect with strong boundaries has been misinterpreted because no communication occurred. You have a right to your life and decisions without feeling unsupported by your mom and she has a right to be upset with you because instead of communicating you left her out and made her feel less than. The both of you need space from one another and hopefully, your mom will come around. Enjoy your new bundle of joy.", "NTA your mother might have \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to say stuff but you doesn\u2019t mean you need to hear it. Congratulations on your baby. Your 6 year old will be a great big sister. Don\u2019t call your mum, and if she does get in touch don\u2019t let her minimise this or turn herself into the victim. She tried to ruin one pregnancy with her negativity and she\u2019s just mad she didn\u2019t get the chance to do it again", "First of all, I just wanted to say that I am so sorry for your previous loss.

I hope you\u2019re both doing well and make sure to get all the rest that you can.\n\nThirdly, you\u2019re NTA but your mother sure is. Who the hell accuses their daughter for \u2018silencing her freedom of speech\u2019 in this situation? Like holy crap, I can tell where you guys live in the world based on that sentiment alone. Your mother is acting like you made it your personal effort to wound her feelings over this whole matter when that was not your intention in the slightest.\n\nEveryone deals with grief differently. Some want to talk their heart out about it and get things off their chest. Some internalize their feelings because they\u2019re not comfortable talking about the subject, feel like they don\u2019t have proper support, etc. I know that when I experienced a loss before my current it broke my heart and left me very anxious, to the point where I had to go on anxiety medication when I got pregnant again because I was scared I would lose this one too.\n\nStay strong, maintain your boundaries, and don\u2019t feel guilty. Right now you\u2019re in a very hectic time with a newborn and you should just focus on yourself and babe in this special time.", "NTA. You did the right thing.\n\nI think your mother may be projecting when she talks about revenge and vindictiveness.", "NTA. Congratulations on your baby.\nFreedom of speech means that you are allowed to speak your mind without censorship. It does not mean that people have to listen to you or that it will be without consequences.\n\nBlaming you for being vindictive rather than rejoicing over your healthy baby really says it all. In your place I would stop calling and wait for her to apologize.", "NTA. You deserve peace. She wasn't willing to promote that, she's the problem. And her freedom of speech doesn't mean you have to listen", "NTA. Your mom sounds like such a pro, I'd guess your mom has been getting away with this kind of emotional abuse all your life. Torments you and still makes herself out to be the victim.", "NTA, and consider this a gift from your baby, whose very existence has given you insight into your mother's true character:\n\n* She doesn't wish you well, she wishes for you to be compliant. \n\n* Instead of being a comfort during your grief and this pregnancy, heightened your fears and essentially implied that you were asking for a terrible outcome instead of the beautiful healthy baby you have.\n\n* She doesn't want to support you, she wants to make the important events in your life about her.\n\n* She calls you vindictive, insults and berates you while you're still dealing with childbirth, and then vindictively punishes you with her silent treatment.\n\nI know you want a good and loving relationship with your mother, but it's clear that she's either unwilling or incapable of actually being the mom you want. You have an amazing husband and a wonderful family with your children. Maybe it's time to let go of the wishful thinking about your mother and spend your energy on the people who love and need you the most. \n\nIf your mother does the work on herself, if she sincerely apologizes and knows why she was in the wrong, and if she doesn't demand that you bend over backwards to win her back, maybe then you can let her back into your life... Slowly and with firm boundaries in place. But you don't need to swallow her mistreatment or let someone who treats you badly around you and your family. Know that you're better off without her if she stays the way she is. \n\nCongratulations on the beautiful new addition to your family. I hope you have a happy, healthy holiday season and new year!", "I guess this would depend on what your family's stance is on abortion. I personally would never nonchalantly throw around recommendations of abortion but then again I am not a mother. There are a lot of people, including people in my family, who are staunchly Catholic and view any suggestions of abortion as offensive.", "NTA,   Your mother sounds like she\u2019s on the spectrum or at least some kinda of BPD. \n\nI\u2019d suggest not trying to contact for a while and let her slink her way back. \n\nOr better still,  offer to make the no contact permanent.", "ESH\n\nHiding a pregnancy/ birth is one of those things you really can't come back from, so if you do it, you have to be sure you can bear the consequences. Instead of telling your mom you got all the tests and the baby is fine, or having an honest conversation that she is freaking you out and you need her to do x, y, and z for you, you took the 'easy' way out, and now your relationship with her is going to have a great, big, giant, *unfixable* dent in it from now on. \n\nYou already mention being the 'unfavored' child, and now your mom thinks you excluded her for petty, vindictive reasons. That's the sort of person she thinks you are. \n\nSo, while I get the need and the impulse to avoid her, you might find the avoidance has now become permanent, and you really should have seen that coming.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
