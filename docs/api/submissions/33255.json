Before my youngest, I had given birth to my angel baby, who lived 8 minutes and was born premature. My 6 year old was born with Down syndrome, and a heart defect. She needed multiple surgeries at birth, but now is thriving. I know you guys are probably thinking why would I have another baby after this, but it really wasn\u2019t planned. \n\nMy mother has said since the beginning of my pregnancy about termination, how I\u2019m too old, how something certainly will be wrong with this baby as well. It was stressful, and heart wrenching; my husband talked to me how I shouldn\u2019t tell her when I was going into labor because she would make it stressful for me. 9 days ago, I gave birth to my healthy baby girl at the age of 44, no health issues. After I came home and rested for a few days I had invited my mother over. When she got there she began to cry, and said she couldn\u2019t believe I would exclude her. I told her I had no other choice, that she wasn\u2019t a healthy person to be around for my pregnancy.\n\nShe accused me of silencing her \u201cfreedom of speech,\u201d and how she was only warning me and not setting me up for heartbreak. I said no, you made me worry more then I needed too. She then said I did this out of revenge and vindictiveness, and not for my own sake but for my own satisfaction. We got into an argument and my husband ended up asking her to leave. I\u2019ve been upset for days now, she hasn\u2019t answered any of my calls.

You have a right to your life and decisions without feeling unsupported by your mom and she has a right to be upset with you because instead of communicating you left her out and made her feel less than.

Your mother is acting like you made it your personal effort to wound her feelings over this whole matter when that was not your intention in the slightest.\n\nEveryone deals with grief differently. Some want to talk their heart out about it and get things off their chest. Some internalize their feelings because they\u2019re not comfortable talking about the subject, feel like they don\u2019t have proper support, etc. I know that when I experienced a loss before my current it broke my heart and left me very anxious, to the point where I had to go on anxiety medication when I got pregnant again because I was scared I would lose this one too.\n\nStay strong, maintain your boundaries, and don\u2019t feel guilty.

You have an amazing husband and a wonderful family with your children. Maybe it's time to let go of the wishful thinking about your mother and spend your energy on the people who love and need you the most. \n\nIf your mother does the work on herself, if she sincerely apologizes and knows why she was in the wrong, and if she doesn't demand that you bend over backwards to win her back, maybe then you can let her back into your life... Slowly and with firm boundaries in place. But you don't need to swallow her mistreatment or let someone who treats you badly around you and your family. Know that you're better off without her if she stays the way she is. \n\nCongratulations on the beautiful new addition to your family.

Instead of telling your mom you got all the tests and the baby is fine, or having an honest conversation that she is freaking you out and you need her to do x, y, and z for you, you took the 'easy' way out, and now your relationship with her is going to have a great, big, giant, *unfixable* dent in it from now on. \n\nYou already mention being the 'unfavored' child, and now your mom thinks you excluded her for petty, vindictive reasons. That's the sort of person she thinks you are. \n\nSo, while I get the need and the impulse to avoid her, you might find the avoidance has now become permanent, and you really should have seen that coming.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
