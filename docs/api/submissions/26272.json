His oldest son is Sam (15m). Sam's from my brother's first marriage. When Sam was 6 his mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and she died a year later. My brother met his second wife when Sam was 8 and married her when Sam was 9. They have three children together now ages 5, 3 and 18 months. \n\nSam has always called his younger siblings his half siblings and this has always bothered my brother and SIL. They have corrected him repeatedly, taken him to therapy, individual and family, and have continued therapy for almost 6 years. It started while SIL was pregnant and Sam was saying baby was a half sibling not just a sibling. They have changed therapists every few months when they don't like the progress being made. While doing all this they continue to correct Sam every time and my brother has told Sam's friends that Sam is wrong and he has siblings, not half siblings.\n\nFor the last year my brother has our parents and our sisters correcting Sam every time they hear him say half siblings or half sister/half brother. I was told I should correct him too. But I have not. It has been a discussion and I have said it does not feel right to gang up on him and try to harass him into submission on this topic. They tell me Sam clearly isn't willing to work with a therapist to get to a point where the half doesn't matter so there's nothing wrong with nudging him along with correcting him when he \"slips up\".\n\nMy brother has been on my ass for the last couple of months about my lack of effort to correct Sam. He has told me that my 5 year old niece has started to question why her brother (Sam) is cold and why he always says they're half siblings. He said she has already asked him if Sam loves her or if she did something wrong. So why would I not try to save her the heartache and get Sam on board with loving his siblings and dropping the half. I told him I don't agree with the lengths he's going to. I said after nearly 6 years if nothing has changed does he really want to break his son to get what he wants? I also asked him why it bothers him so much when his own best friend refers to his half siblings as half, and he has never batted an eye at that. I told him he might wish things were perfect and that Sam adapted to everything perfectly but he lives in this reality and not in that dream.\n\nMy brother ignored the rest of what I said and called me out for not agreeing with the lengths. He said that as a parent he has to go to whatever lengths it takes to protect his kids and to make sure they turn out to be good people. He said right now Sam is turning into someone he doesn't like and is turning into a real asshole and fuck me for judging him on his parenting. I have no right to say this to him and I do not understand the difficulty of moving on and trying to bring your kid with you after loss and he's doing his best.\n\nMy brother told our mom he's disgusted with me and thinks I should reflect on my actions.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693935497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16auob5/aita_for_telling_my_brother_i_dont_agree_with_the/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.", "NTA. When people are shitty parents they deserve to be judged for it.", "NTA. This is so stupid. Your brother is an idiot and an asshole and most assuredly creating a hostile environment for all of his children by trying to force something so meaningless on Sam, AND doing so in a way that communicates to the younger kids that their half-brother must hate them if he doesn\u2019t use specific labels. \n\nWhat Sam calls his half-siblings has no bearing on how he feels about them. I have full siblings and half-siblings. I usually refer to my half-siblings as half-siblings. I\u2019m closer to some of them than I am to some of my full siblings. It literally does not matter to me, or to them, at all. They are all my siblings. \u201cHalf\u201d is just a factual representation of our relationship that makes it less confusing to others if I then refer to \u201ctheir\u201d mother.", "NTA. Nothing good can come from trying to force a kid to accept new family members against their will, especially not when you're trying to rope the whole family into bullying this kid because he just wants to acknowledge something that is objectively the truth. I wouldn't be surprised if the coldness towards his half-siblings is being driven specifically by the parents trying to force him to accept them, where if they hadn't fought them from the very beginning, he'd get on fine with his half-sibling. His feelings are being ignored, maybe have BEEN ignored since his mother's death, and he's trying to fight for himself in whatever way he can.", "NTA\nDon't worry about it,  there's only three years left until  Sam leaves the entire  family (except you)  behind because this kind of pressure is not helpful for a child.  Your brother is a massive ah and sonos everybody else who tells Sam he is incorrect for calling his half siblings half siblings.", "My read is that, if Sam is in fact being more of an asshole than the usual teenage boy (unclear if that's the case) it has more to do with the constant pressure from his dad to erase his mom from his life in favor of the step mom. Which is effectively what brother is trying to do with the therapist shopping.", "I agree. I also think they are expecting these instant results and so moving therapist whenever someone doesn't get the results they want.", "This. Like... he's factually correct. They *are* his half-siblings. Your brother can rage about that until he's blue in the face, but it's true.", "They claim that's what they're trying to do but it can't happen while he's calling them half siblings and being distant with them. But I think they kind of screwed it up by pushing him into therapy once they heard him saying half. Maybe he would have warmed up if left to his own devices and not pushed.", "He's distant with them and doesn't play with them. Though I think the force used to get him to call them siblings over half siblings has played a role. I have never heard of him saying anything mean or with the intent to upset them. Avoiding seems to be his preference.", "NTA. Sam will move out @18, and never come back. Your  brother has already destroyed his relationship with his son. Younger kids questioning it because the parents make such a big deal about it", "No, he's trying to help himself. Not his son.", "What? No. He\u2019s not.  He\u2019s harassing and browbeating his son to say something untrue.  The kids ARE half siblings.  Period.  No amount of saying up is down and down is up will change that fact.  I know gaslighting is the term du jour here but this is legit it - he\u2019s trying to convince the kid that saying the true and accurate descriptor is wrong for Dad\u2019s own emotional reasons.  \n\nThis is bullying at best, abusive at worst (name calling, therapist hopping and now isolating the kid).", "Correct, it isn\u2019t an ideal situation for Sam. The OP\u2019s brother wants to ignore that fact.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong or harmful about calling someone a half sibling when they only related to you through one parent. Sam has a different biological mother than his siblings. He also had a different mother when it comes to social and emotional care. He had a different family.\n\nSaying half-sibling in this case doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s meant to be a dig. It strongly sounds like Sam doesn\u2019t want to pretend the past didn\u2019t happen and is being punished for it.", "They're like people who doctor shop to get the diagnosis they want. All your brother and his wife are doing is alienating their son slowly. They'll figure it out in three years when he leaves, changes his phone number and blocks them on all forms of communication.", "Has your brother considered the possibility that Sam is \u201ccold\u201d towards his half siblings specifically because he and his wife are forcing a type of relationship that Sam doesn\u2019t identify with and he rebelling against it? Like if they\u2019d just left him alone and allowed Sam to call them what he wanted, perhaps his half siblings existence wouldn\u2019t be a point of contention to him at all.", "It effectively erases his own mom. Horrible idea. OP is NTA", "So they're going to break his mind and replace his rational thoughts with their party line. That's how cults get started...", "You're right, he'd probably have a much better relationship with them if he hadn't spent the last few years being harangued, disliked, badmouthed, and pushed into therapy he doesn't need for accurately calling them his half siblings. Your brother has such a crazy issue with the word \"half\" that he's been willing to torpedo both his relationship with his son and his son's with his siblings so that he never has to hear it again, and he's blaming the *kid* for the results of his own terrible parenting? Ugh. Ugh.", "It sounds less like the push into therapy is the problem and more like the switching of therapists every time they don\u2019t get what they want is an issue. Poor Sam.", "That's exactly what I was thinking. Making an issue of something like that while he is still trying to adjust to a new family situation is not the way to sensitively move things forward. If they hadn't made such a big deal of it, things might be very different right now.\n\nAnd now he's a teenager forcing these unessential things on him won't improve their relationship. He's probably also still grieving for his mother in some form or other and being forced to call his half-siblings his full siblings only reminds him of his mum and how they can't be full siblings.", "Your brother is destroying his relationship with Sam. The second that kid turns eighteen he's gonna disappear and never come back. No wedding invite, no relationship with grandkids, nothing. And it kinda seems like your brother would be happy about that. You might want to ask your brother how much he values his son and if he wants to lose him, because he will.", "It sounds like the 15 year old is grey rocking his family to survive.  I'm curious if they force him to babysit or play with the much younger children or babysitting them.\n\nI think you are wonderful for looking out for your nephew.  NTA", "The boy is just bidding his time before he can escape and go NC.", "How? I'm not sure I understand the logic", "It's not a cult, it's just emotional desperation. They want him and everybody else to feel what they feel so they can validate their marriage-- they can't handle their own family members disagreeing with and judging them.", "By calling them just his siblings, he's saying they're his full blooded siblings. As in from the father and the mother. The son's mother died at an age where he has memories of her. He's accepted his father's new children but his mother didn't birth them, his stepmother did. So they're his half siblings. This isn't a brother rejecting his sister. It's a son honouring his mother", "Thats a fair perspective.\n\nIf I were the father, I'd want my son to bond with his new siblings - theyre the only family he's got moving forward", "I get where you're coming from - you go from having one kid to four and you perceive one as alienating the others. But that's why it's so ridiculously important to always try and see  things from your child's perspective because if you don't show them how to considerate and empathetic, how will they ever learn? I'm not saying to let them do whatever they want because they'll always need boundaries. But OP's brother is in the wrong here, though he could fix this with actually communicating with his son.\n\nAs for the \"only family\", his mother is still his family no matter what. You don't just forget and move on from your mother unless you're either too young to remember her or if you have good reason to.", "If your girl is to have your children bond with each other, why would you purposefully make your sons half siblings\u2019 existence a point of contention then?"]}
