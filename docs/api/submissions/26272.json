His oldest son is Sam (15m). Sam's from my brother's first marriage. When Sam was 6 his mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and she died a year later. My brother met his second wife when Sam was 8 and married her when Sam was 9. They have three children together now ages 5, 3 and 18 months. \n\nSam has always called his younger siblings his half siblings and this has always bothered my brother and SIL. They have corrected him repeatedly, taken him to therapy, individual and family, and have continued therapy for almost 6 years. It started while SIL was pregnant and Sam was saying baby was a half sibling not just a sibling. They have changed therapists every few months when they don't like the progress being made. While doing all this they continue to correct Sam every time and my brother has told Sam's friends that Sam is wrong and he has siblings, not half siblings.\n\nFor the last year my brother has our parents and our sisters correcting Sam every time they hear him say half siblings or half sister/half brother. I was told I should correct him too. But I have not. It has been a discussion and I have said it does not feel right to gang up on him and try to harass him into submission on this topic. They tell me Sam clearly isn't willing to work with a therapist to get to a point where the half doesn't matter so there's nothing wrong with nudging him along with correcting him when he \"slips up\".\n\nMy brother has been on my ass for the last couple of months about my lack of effort to correct Sam. He has told me that my 5 year old niece has started to question why her brother (Sam) is cold and why he always says they're half siblings. He said she has already asked him if Sam loves her or if she did something wrong. So why would I not try to save her the heartache and get Sam on board with loving his siblings and dropping the half. I told him I don't agree with the lengths he's going to. I said after nearly 6 years if nothing has changed does he really want to break his son to get what he wants? I also asked him why it bothers him so much when his own best friend refers to his half siblings as half, and he has never batted an eye at that. I told him he might wish things were perfect and that Sam adapted to everything perfectly but he lives in this reality and not in that dream.\n\nMy brother ignored the rest of what I said and called me out for not agreeing with the lengths. He said that as a parent he has to go to whatever lengths it takes to protect his kids and to make sure they turn out to be good people. He said right now Sam is turning into someone he doesn't like and is turning into a real asshole and fuck me for judging him on his parenting. I have no right to say this to him and I do not understand the difficulty of moving on and trying to bring your kid with you after loss and he's doing his best.\n\nMy brother told our mom he's disgusted with me and thinks I should reflect on my actions.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693935497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16auob5/aita_for_telling_my_brother_i_dont_agree_with_the/", "score": 3479, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is an idiot and an asshole and most assuredly creating a hostile environment for all of his children by trying to force something so meaningless on Sam, AND doing so in a way that communicates to the younger kids that their half-brother must hate them if he doesn\u2019t use specific labels. \n\nWhat Sam calls his half-siblings has no bearing on how he feels about them. I have full siblings and half-siblings. I usually refer to my half-siblings as half-siblings. I\u2019m closer to some of them than I am to some of my full siblings. It literally does not matter to me, or to them, at all.

I wouldn't be surprised if the coldness towards his half-siblings is being driven specifically by the parents trying to force him to accept them, where if they hadn't fought them from the very beginning, he'd get on fine with his half-sibling.

Your brother is a massive ah and sonos everybody else who tells Sam he is incorrect for calling his half siblings half siblings.", "My read is that, if Sam is in fact being more of an asshole than the usual teenage boy (unclear if that's the case) it has more to do with the constant pressure from his dad to erase his mom from his life in favor of the step mom.

But I think they kind of screwed it up by pushing him into therapy once they heard him saying half. Maybe he would have warmed up if left to his own devices and not pushed.", "He's distant with them and doesn't play with them.

He\u2019s harassing and browbeating his son to say something untrue.  The kids ARE half siblings.  Period.  No amount of saying up is down and down is up will change that fact.  I know gaslighting is the term du jour here but this is legit it - he\u2019s trying to convince the kid that saying the true and accurate descriptor is wrong for Dad\u2019s own emotional reasons.  \n\nThis is bullying at best, abusive at worst (name calling, therapist hopping and now isolating the kid).", "Correct, it isn\u2019t an ideal situation for Sam. The OP\u2019s brother wants to ignore that fact.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong or harmful about calling someone a half sibling when they only related to you through one parent. Sam has a different biological mother than his siblings. He also had a different mother when it comes to social and emotional care. He had a different family.\n\nSaying half-sibling in this case doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s meant to be a dig.

Ugh. Ugh.", "It sounds less like the push into therapy is the problem and more like the switching of therapists every time they don\u2019t get what they want is an issue. Poor Sam.", "That's exactly what I was thinking. Making an issue of something like that while he is still trying to adjust to a new family situation is not the way to sensitively move things forward. If they hadn't made such a big deal of it, things might be very different right now.\n\nAnd now he's a teenager forcing these unessential things on him won't improve their relationship. He's probably also still grieving for his mother in some form or other and being forced to call his half-siblings his full siblings only reminds him of his mum and how they can't be full siblings.", "Your brother is destroying his relationship with Sam. The second that kid turns eighteen he's gonna disappear and never come back. No wedding invite, no relationship with grandkids, nothing.

As in from the father and the mother. The son's mother died at an age where he has memories of her. He's accepted his father's new children but his mother didn't birth them, his stepmother did. So they're his half siblings. This isn't a brother rejecting his sister. It's a son honouring his mother", "Thats a fair perspective.\n\nIf I were the father, I'd want my son to bond with his new siblings - theyre the only family he's got moving forward", "I get where you're coming from - you go from having one kid to four and you perceive one as alienating the others. But that's why it's so ridiculously important to always try and see  things from your child's perspective because if you don't show them how to considerate and empathetic, how will they ever learn? I'm not saying to let them do whatever they want because they'll always need boundaries. But OP's brother is in the wrong here, though he could fix this with actually communicating with his son.\n\nAs for the \"only family\", his mother is still his family no matter what. You don't just forget and move on from your mother unless you're either too young to remember her or if you have good reason to.", "If your girl is to have your children bond with each other, why would you purposefully make your sons half siblings\u2019 existence a point of contention then?", "\"So why would I not try to save her the heartache and get Sam on board with loving his siblings and dropping the half.\"\n\nDuh. Ask your brother why he's so set on causing his son chronic heartache for 6 years. It sounds like he doesn't care about his son as a person at all.", "NTA. My parents did this. I am the younger, half sibling. My older half siblings and I are very close as adults, because we formed those relationships on our own. The never saying step or half thing really bothered my half brother much more than my half sister. He still holds a lot of resentment towards my parents.

I find it interesting that your biggest point was ignored by your brother. I would keep bringing it up. Is he so determined to have things his (and his wife's) own way that he is willing to break Sam to do it? Is Sam not one of his kids that needs protection? Is his and his wife's vision of a perfectly blended family so important that Sam has to be a casualty to their ideals?\n\nSam is cold to his siblings because everyone is telling him he can't process things the way he needs to. Your brother and SIL refuse to acknowledge that Sam feels othered in a way they don't understand because they've not been in his position. Sam had a mom that he may miss terribly. By trying to make the other children not his half siblings, they're effectively telling him that he can't miss and acknowledge his mom.\n\nIf none of this does any good, then remind your brother that Sam becomes an adult in just three short years.

Dear lord.", "NTA- Your brother and SIL are trying to force Sam to have a relationship when he doesn't want to. That will already lead to resentment for Sam to his half-siblings, dad and step-mom. That's definitely part of the reason this is happening.\n\nThe therapists probably are validating Sam's feelings and making him feel heard and understood. And the minute your brother and SIL see that, they're shopping for a new one, because they're expecting a therapist to take THEIR side. Not gonna happen. Any good therapist will listen to the patient(Sam) and not care what outside forces are saying.\n\nYour brother saying he's trying to protect his kids and make sure they turn out to be good people is so messed up. Sam is HIS child too. He probably wishes Sam just wasn't around or didn't exist. He's certainly not protecting him.\n\nI hope Sam gets out of there the minute he turns 18 and never looks back. In which case, stay close to him and let him know you're there for him. You're the only family he'll have left, as the rest is failing him.", "This reads like trying to erase his son's relationship with his mother after she died.

I think your nephew refers to his siblings as half siblings as a gentle reminder to himself and anyone else who's Iistening that he had a mom and that even though she's gone, she's still his mom.

And, if they\u2019re constantly switching therapists, I have to agree with the others here that feel that the issue is less the lack of timely results (I don\u2019t think any therapist would be promising anything of the sort), but rather that the therapist is validating your nephew\u2019s feelings and that\u2019s not what they want (meaning therapy is a bludgeon for conformity with them, not a tool to ensure he flourishes as it should be).\n\nI imagine it would be frustrating for a parent to have this, and it\u2019s easy to empathize with your younger niece, but the fact is that your nephew can\u2019t be forced to remove that emotional distance he\u2019s choosing to maintain (and has probably adopted because in three years, during his formative years, big changes were forced upon him). And, I\u2019d wager the struggle it has become has only made him more stubborn (does anyone remember being a pre-teen and teen?). Like, what could make you feel more distant from your blended family then continually being sent to therapy for six years because he hasn\u2019t felt as he \u201cshould\u201d? Therapy requires some measure of buy-in to get results and it sounds like there will never be that because your brother and his wife have not seemed to consider your nephew\u2019s own emotional needs.\n\nIt is normal for someone who experienced loss at an early age to erect barriers; these are barriers to protect them from pain. These are barriers put up to create a comfortable distance between him and the rest of his family, but what reason has been giving to put him at ease? At 6 his mom was diagnosed with cancer, at 7 she did, at 8 he has a new mom, and he\u2019s been in therapy for 6 years because he won\u2019t call his half-sister his sister. Rather than slowly trying to give him reason to breakdown some of these barriers; they\u2019ve reinforced the importance of these barriers, they\u2019ve created reason to keep and maintain that distance, and trying to get everyone to do the same will just tell him whose supportive of his emotional needs and who isn\u2019t. Because, while I would say that one should maybe lose some of that emotional distance over the years, this account doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s been an attempt to work on these issues by taking his needs into consideration. It\u2019s the father\u2019s and step-mother\u2019s emotional needs dictating this, not your nephews. \n\nIt sounds like your brother is putting his own emotional needs ahead of his son\u2019s, and he\u2019s probably not going to have his son once he\u2019s an adult.

From having a massive emotional response to you setting up a boundary, to therapist shopping for his child when they don't fix the behavior *he* finds to be a problem, to harassing his family members into pressuring a small child to do as he wants, he is showing clear signs of needing professional help for his controlling behaviors.\n\nAs a side note, it sounds like he is trying to erase the trauma caused by the death of his first wife and by proxy his planned life-long partner by trying to erase the memory of the events completely, but Sam's obstinance is a constant reminder of the event and that's why he is having such an intense emotional response and not just cutting Sam out of the family dynamic, not that it is the correct response but this subreddit has shown it's a popular option.\n\nThis is just a hypothesis though considering I don't know the dynamics between the brother and the first wife.", "NTA. \n\nJFC. \n\nTell Sam he can come live with me if he wants to. \n\nI cannot FATHOM why this is such big deal.

Siblings are just the childhood version of coworkers.", "At this point Sam is probably saying it to purposefully piss everyone off.\n\n\u201cOh sorry it was a slip up\u201d *big wink*", "Good image!", "I pictured Miss Havisham from \u201cGreat Expectations \u201c walking around in a pair of cleats and wearing a youth league baseball uniform over her tattered wedding dress with her veil floating around her and muttering \u201chalf half \u2026haaallff.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "Guessing she or they tried to erase her memory/presence.\n\nWhy are people so shitty?", "Guessing she or they tried to erase her memory/presence.\n\nWhy are people so shitty?", "Not only his, but any possible relationship with between him and the other siblings and any family member who agrees with OPs brother is going out the door too if he keeps this up.", "When my nephew was that age he had a little sister of that young age and he was always very affectionate towards her and still is. I guess it depends on the children in question. \n\nOP's brother though is definitely not helping the situation at all. He is actually sabotaging them being close with pushing Sam like that. It might be unfair to the three little kids, but for sure Sam's resentment of his father and stepmother likely leaks over to their other children. No one likes it being forced to have a relationship with someone. Sam for sure is digging his heels in and will continue to fight his father's and stepmother's pressure and control. Being close to his siblings would kind of make his father and stepmother the winners in this fight and I don't see him doing it.\n\nAll these problems likely started with Sam's father moving on quite fast after his first wife's death. Children generally don't like this. And now he is kind of trying to force his son to forget the fact that he has another mother than the stepmother. Sam is not onboard with just replacing his mother and acting like she didn't exist or is easily replaced.", "My brother. He was 12 when I came along and he *adored* me! He involved me in everything he did, and still tried to after he moved out at 18! He once annoyed his GF by taking her to a fireworks display for the sole purpose of having a woman there who could walk little four year old me to the toilets!\n\nETA Coincidentally, he's my half-brother. Different fathers.", "*I *I *I *Interacting", "Be one of those dream TV siblings who is very involved and loving and would choose to spend time with his 5 year old sibling over others. The stuff you see in some really fantasy driven movies and TV shows.", "Yes! I had the same thought! I'd be shocked if that's not the case. They insist on this image of one happy family. You can be a happy family and not try to erase a child's late mother from existence!", "What they\u2019re going to end up with is a half brother who doesn\u2019t acknowledge them at all once he\u2019s 18. Your brother is an AH. Not you. NTA.", "Same here, my dad's the only one in the pic but we were all raised in the same house with our mom (and later stepda. We were also raised speaking Spanish, and there isn't really a clean phrase for half siblings (that I know).\n\nIt's kinda funny though cause if you lined us all up only the two youngest look even remotely similar, and even that's mainly due to their skin tone. (We went from white to cooked ham to dark tan the younger we go)", "Same here. My half-brother is much older than me but we were close when I was little, even though we didn\u2019t see each other all that much. He\u2019s my brother until I need to differentiate for a specific reason.", "So sad. Poor kid.", "Veeeeery well put, chapeau!", "Wtf? Your kids cousin is your partners kid. So your partner had a kid with your son\u2019s aunt or uncle? Which would be your brother or sister? Or am I missing something there?", "I don't know... a boy protecting his mother's memory amid such overt and forceful attempts to erase her in favour of a de fakto drop-in replacement, doesn't read as asshole to me. I would be WILDLY proud to have such a son, and although I don't believe there is anything after death, the thought of his mother sitting on a cloud with happy tears of pride in her eyes, moves me.", "Because they're humans.   \nJust ask any other species.", "*OP's", "TlSjncw idk what the therapist (s) have said, and neither do the people commenting as if they do, . \nSo I'm speaking about OP.", "The behavior of OP's brother is causing drama and discord in the entire family.

Downvote all you want. YALL DONT USE THE SYSTEM CORRECTLY ANYHOW. FICKLE", "and dad & new wife start popping out new kids the first year they are married.", "I think he will be if Dad keeps going this route of \"they're your siblings not your half siblings.\" It's honestly not that hard to explain to a 5 year old \"He had a different mommy who went to heaven\", but he did lose his wife and it's probably hard to go through that 3 times. Still, it's not the boy's responsibility at the end of the day."]}
