She would act aloof around my parents as well.\n\nMy brother said her behavior was because she didn\u2019t have a good home life, and I believe that. But I decided to keep my distance around her.\n\nWhen we graduated, she didn\u2019t want to keep living at home so my parents allowed her to live with us.

He also said Sky is sorry.\n\nI think he made his priorities clear when he constantly chose Sky over me. I told him I would not be attending his wedding and now my family is mad at me.

He\u2019s not her property, and needs to stand up and set some boundaries with her.", "Do...they have your phone number? Do...they know how to text or call people?

If family members push, well you have the support of being able to say you went and showed your support, but this level of closeness is what's comfortable to you. You're not interested in more than this right now and if that's a problem/too difficult for them, you can go back to less/no contact so they don't have to try to wrestle with their feelings about it.

Why is your brother not contacting you directly and going through family?\n2. Why has he not suggested a quiet, private meeting in which both he and Sky can convey their **heartfelt & sincere** apologies?\n\nAn 'apology' from your brother saying Sky is sorry, is NOT an apology.  If Sky has learned anything or changed at all from therapy then she needs to reach out to make amends.  But by the same token you should probably allow her a chance to do so. \n\nAt this point I am going to say NTA - but only if you give your brother & Sky a change to SHOW  and prove they have changed for the better.

Grow up and learn to forgive maybe, refusing to talk to people is so juvenile.", "\"*I think he made his priorities clear when he constantly chose Sky over me*.\" - it's not a competition.

So, I'd change the narrative by making myself look compassionate and patient. Your brother has made his choice. I see no reason for you to continue not having a great relationship with him. AT the end of the day, he is stuck with Rachel and you get to go back to your life unfettered.\n\nNTA.
