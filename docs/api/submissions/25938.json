Being young isn\u2019t a get-out-of-jail-free card, but it does make it more likely that she\u2019s improved and healed.\n\nWhat your brother/family is suggesting is that you have to totally forgive and forget and pretend everything is fine. You don\u2019t have to do that.\n\nIf Sky is *genuinely* better and ashamed of her abusive behavior (what she was doing was abusive as fuck to your brother and you) you can consider being on neutral terms with her. You don\u2019t have to like her or trust her, but you\u2019ll consider tolerating her to have a relationship with your brother.\n\nFigure out what you need to hear from Sky and your brother\u2014a sincere apology and acknowledgement her behavior was cruel, and then what the boundaries will be moving forward, what Sky can *do* and not just *say* to help build a relationship.\n\nI don\u2019t mean make her perform like a trained monkey! But that she will be polite to you, she will not create a problem if you spend time with your brother, she will not ruin your special days. Consider a low-stakes trial run, like a dinner to celebrate OP\u2019s belated housewarming. If she tolerates the attention and focus being on you, consider more interactions. If she can\u2019t handle it? No contact.\n\nAnd if your parents/brother/Sky try to rush you faster, that\u2019s a dead stop. They can move at your pace or no pace. You\u2019ve spent enough time arranging your life around Sky, now she needs to arrange hers around you.", "NTA sounds like your brother has had 3 years to apologise to you and authentically and genuinely put in the work to attempt to regain your trust.

I completely understand where you're coming from and your feelings are valid. I would be wary of Sky and your brother, too. \n\nMy only advice is to give her one chance to apologize to you directly and show that she's changed. Your brother also needs to apologize for all the ways he enabled her conduct and hurt you. Ask if they're willing to do to that. If so, give them a second chance for your own sake, because it's clear you love and miss your brother and, assuming he's genuinely changed, your life will be better with him in it. Do all of this as soon as possible, so you at least have a chance of making amends before the wedding, because missing that event may do irreparable damage to your relationship. \n\nIf, however, they're unwilling to apologize and they haven't truly changed, then you're better off without them.", "NAH The real question is whether you want to a relationship with your brother, and whether he (and possibly Sky) are willing to make amends sufficient for you to trust him/them again.\n\nWhat happened in the past really sucked, and how Sky treated you was shitty. She may have been dealing with a lot, but that's not an excuse to treat other people badly. And your brother sucks for enabling her so badly and catering to her insane demands.\n\nBut ... that's all in the past. You have a choice about how to move forward. Sky is still going to be in your brother's life and, by extension, your family's lives. Now you have to decide how you want to deal with that. I would not blame you for continuing to keep things distant, or for refusing to be present at their wedding. I personally think the wedding is the absolute worst possible time to reconnect. And if your brother and/or Skye have hurt you too badly to ever want a close relationship again, that is your choice and it is one everyone in your life should respect.\n\nYou clearly valued the relationship you once had with your brother. You may never have that close a relationship with him again, but it's also possible that you and he could reconcile and have something closer to the relationship you once wanted with him. That will never happen unless you're willing and able to move past how they treated you. (Which, again, you don't have to.) Sky may have changed and both she and your brother may be filled with regret, or they may not care. Even if they are filled with regret and sincerely want to fix things, it may not be enough, and that's okay.\n\nIf you do want to test the water with them, I'd recommend starting with something low stakes, like meeting your brother alone for coffee. Have an honest conversation about everything and see how he responds. If he dismisses or minimizes your feelings, you have your answer. If he won't meet you alone and shows up with Sky, you have you answer. \n\nAnd you're under no obligation to meet or reestablish your relationship with either of them.

He\u2019s called me crying numerous times about her cheating with her ex, her being extremely mean to him, and overall about how unhappy he is. She even laid hands on him. I listened time and time again. Offered him a place to stay. He almost moved away from her 3 times. But always changed his mind. Then one day he blocked me on everything because I commented on his Facebook telling him I loved to see him happy and she must have been going through his phone and saw the comment and realized that I have her blocked. Or maybe she went through his messages and saw the last time I tried to help him. I\u2019m being punished for being a supportive sister. So I decided if he doesn\u2019t want me around, I\u2019m gone. But when that relationship crashes and burns, I won\u2019t be there either. It took me years to realize I wasn\u2019t one of his best friends and close family members. I was only ever there to serve a purpose for his selfish needs. He acted like he cared but would disappear for long periods of time to only reappear when he needed me. And somehow he was conveniently never there when I needed him. It hurt really bad and I cried a lot. I grieved him as if he died. He\u2019s making the choice to shun me.

(Just my fun way of referring to his ex who 100% got her shenanigans straight from her mom's playbook). \n\nWhen they first met in college, my brother and I were very, very close. I'm talking frequent calls to check in each week because we went to colleges 10+hours away from each other. Plus, we had many shared friends at home despite him being 3 years older. Our parents were very involved, but in the way you want parents to be. Deep discussions about our dreams and plans for the future, generous financial and emotional support, recognition that we're independent humans who they not only love but also *like* a whole lot \u2013 the whole nine yards.\n\nAt first, she seemed nice enough, if a bit distant. But when I met her and she saw how close we were (me, him, and mom), she started her campaign. I won't go into the full rundown of everything, but suffice it to say she was verbally and physically abusive, punished him for contacting our parents, and even went so far as to suggest there was something icky about our relationship (barf). He stopped talking to me and barely spoke to my mom.\n\nDuring the three years he was with her, I lost my brother. Even when he was home from school, which wasn't often, he wasn't there for me. I almost dropped out of school during a mental health crisis and all I wanted to do was call him. But he just wasn't there for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter they broke up, he took a long time to come to grips with what he had allowed to happen. But he did apologize to me, and I was glad to have my brother back in my life. It wasn't the same at first, but I gave it a chance and he kept showing up. When I broke off my engagement, he suggested renting a place together because I was in a very dark place and he could tell I needed my big brother. It took time, but he showed me with actions rather than words that I mattered to him.\n\nNow, I know our situations are different. My brother's ex was a much more clear bad guy, which probably helped me forgive and forget sooner. He's not still together with her, so I didn't have to navigate forgiving her/trying to build a relationship with her.\n\nI just wanted to share my story to let you know that it is possible to rebuild your relationship with your brother. It will take work and acknowledgement from him that he stopped investing in your relationship. You might have a long road ahead. But it could be worth it.\n\nMy brother is back to being the person I knew and admired growing up. He's my biggest champion and defender, and I do the same for him.
