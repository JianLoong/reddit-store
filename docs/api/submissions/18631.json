There's Lydia (31f), Josh (28m), Leo (25m), me, then Erin (21f), Nadia (18f), and the surprise child Lexie (4f). With that many siblings, it's easy to get lost in the crowd. Some of us have our 'positions,' so to speak. Lydia's the oldest, Lexie's the baby, *I* have a kid (yes, that's my descriptor. OP: gave us a grandchild). Erin is the golden child. She was the last planned child, the one supposed to tie up our family. She was born premature so I understand that my parents coddled her to an extent, but it's more than that now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nErin's getting married and recently told us that she's brought the date forward due to a cancellation. No big deal, it just means they're getting married sooner. But the new date lands on the date of Nadia's HS graduation. Erin was sympathetic, but said she's already committed to the date, they've printed the invitations. My parents normally go overboard on our HS grads, but they said that they'd just have to miss Nadia's. We were all sympathetic, but it wasn't intentional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr so I thought. But Nadia later told me and Leo that she was there when Erin got the call about the cancellation and told Erin that she was graduating that day, but Erin just laughed and accepted the date anyway. This, as much as I hate to admit it, sounds like a very Erin thing to do. She booked her engagement part for the night of Nadia's 18th birthday (luckily, she wasn't celebrating until the weekend). She announced her engagement at my oldest sister's wedding anniversary. Everything is about her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI confronted Erin about this, and she said that Nadia's HS graduation didn't matter. She wanted to get married to the love of her life sooner\u2014and our family had been to plenty of HS graduations at this point, anyway. She said something like, \"we still have Lexie.\" But here's what gets me the most: Nadia's been looking forward to this for so long. She's watched all of us graduate and have these huge celebrations thrown by our parents. I asked Nadia what she wanted, and she said she wanted to have *her* day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I told my family that me and Nadia won't be attending the wedding. Leo has also dropped out. Everyone's angry. Erin's furious, and I didn't make it better by telling her that I could watch our other siblings get married, since it's all the same in her eyes. Mom's trying to convince me to come to the wedding because 'graduation isn't as important' but I feel like if I don't do this then it sets a precedent in Nadia's life that she's always going to mean less than Erin. I've had messages calling me an asshole, an idiot, etc. They're telling me to step up and be a good brother, but that's what I'm doing. My son is supposed to be ring bearer but with how my family is reacting, I'm considering pulling him out of the wedding, too. My dad's told Nadia he'll take her to dinner after the wedding.

Nadia's graduation doesn't matter *to her*...big distinction there. You are FULLY within your rights to skip her wedding as Nadia's graduation absolutely does matter. How cruel of her! I'm a little sick that your mom is just falling in line. \n\nIf you have a need for a little extra \"petty\", you can send your sister a $10 gift card to McDonald's as a wedding present.", "High School Graduations are a once in a life time thing.  You graduate you experience it once, you don't graduate, the best you get is a GED celebration later.\n\nSince like 3/5 marriages end in divorce these days I'd say there's a much better chance of Erin experiencing another wedding, than Nadia would experience another HS Grad.\n\nTypical selfish person, changing plans on everyone and expecting everyone to drop anything they might already have planned.

I'd go to the high school graduation. You're an adult, so treating Nadia like her milestones have meaning is only YOUR choice. Its not anyone else's to make for you. \"Mom, you don't get to decide what's important for me to participate in. Thanks for wanting to help but, I've got this covered and it was an easy decision to make. I feel good about my plans and I hope you enjoy your day too.\"\n\nNTA.

Graduation dates cannot be changed. Text your whole family this post and pull your son out of the wedding. It was incredibly hurtful thing she did.

That isn't your fault. I personally would prioritize a wedding over a graduation, but I think given your reasoning about how special HS grad parties are, it makes sense Nadia would be really upset. If you value the relationship with Nadia over Erin, then the choice is easy for you who to support. It's probably a good idea to think about who you want in your life going forward if Erin is willing to be this blatantly dismissive to other members of the family. Probably isn't the first time, probably won't be the last.", "Nta! Thank you for stepping up for your sister when no one else will", "NTA\n\nI think what struck me the most was the parents just casually saying they would miss their daughter's graduation. \n\nI'm one of 7 kids. Sometimes we had overlapping special events; with that many kids, it was kind of inevitable. My parents worked hard so as not to plan celebrations/special events on the same day. But sometimes stuff happens and the dates are beyond anyone's control. When two kids had graduations on the same day, they split up and each graduate got one parent and 2 or 3 siblings as a cheering section. \n\nWhen it happened, say the big football championship when my brother was captain of the high school football team and my other brother's birthday, they planned ahead and consulted both kids. Usually what would happen is that the birthday kid would get a small acknowledgement of the day--cards, a few gifts, a cake, and the family would go to the football game. Then on the weekend before or after the actual birthday, there would be a big birthday celebration. My parents would feel guilty about missing the \"real\" birthday and do more than they would normally do to celebrate. \n\nI remember my parents had some work obligation of Dad's that Mom also had to attend  on my 7th birthday. They planned a scavenger hunt for small gifts with my babysitter and a special dinner. Then the next day, I got the ice cream and cake and all the presents and a special trip to the Smithsonian (which for some reason was my favorite place to go back then).  Mom felt so badly about the whole thing that she was giving me little presents and food treats for a week. \n\nSo we learned that were compensations for being willing to delay a celebration for a sibling's non-movable event. \n\nComing from this background, these parents seem needlessly cruel to Nadia. Perhaps the parents can do nothing to change the new wedding date. But one of them could attend the wedding and the other the graduation, and then the graduate and parent could join the wedding festivities in progress. And then Nadia could have a nice graduation party a week later. I mean, there's a world of compromise available here. Missing their daughter's graduation is not the only option. \n\nI feel for Nadia and I am glad that she has the OP in her life.", " NTA - your Erin sounds like a narcissist, and I\u2019m sure Nadia appreciates her big brother.  \n\nI\u2019d go one step further and throw her a graduation party of her own.

I\u2019m sure she will try to show you positive this is, but I feel it\u2019s one of those situations where words and even actions feel pale in comparison to the magnitude of this gesture. I\u2019m also sure she realises now but as the years go on she will look back and have ever increasing and new waves of gratitude. Showing up for her despite making other people uncomfortable will do wonders for her self esteem *and* world view. \n\n(Ok so I got carried away here a little (*a lot*) and I\u2019m completely armchair..something.(?) but it was very cathartic for me to write this.

I mean sure, it\u2019s ok sometimes but this kind of shit can really put a dampener on peoples self image and especially as a child, sets a precedent for how she allows strangers and others she lets into her life, to treat her. She may never consciously realise or address it and may seem well adjusted but it\u2019s possible that she will guide her own actions and responses by how her family (it should be parents but with so many siblings and all mostly older, they count too) treats her. \n\n\u201cNew partner didn\u2019t make time to support me because they\u2019re a workaholic.

It\u2019s ok I can\u2019t expect partner to get everything right, they\u2019re only human and it was nice proposal even if I didn\u2019t enjoy it. Most people would be lucky to be in my shoes. \nPartner is making choices about wedding that I don\u2019t agree with and actually make me uncomfortable but it\u2019s ok because it\u2019s not just about me it\u2019s our day. And relationships are about sacrifice. \nPartner is refusing to help me while pregnant but it\u2019s just because they\u2019re stressed about work and incoming newborn. I can be strong and do this essentially by myself because I love them and they are important. \nI\u2019m really struggling with balancing life with kids and work and connecting to my partner. It\u2019s ok it\u2019s just this phase of our life. I\u2019ll keep trying my best even though I feel like I\u2019m falling apart because it\u2019s my duty to do so. \nIt\u2019s been x amount of years and partner still hasn\u2019t stepped up to being a parent and no matter how hard I try they just don\u2019t seem to even want to spend time with me and our kid/s. Maybe I am unlovable after all, I mean I\u2019m doing all the right things you\u2019re supposed to do, but im still struggling. It must be something wrong with me\u201d \n\nNo, she just needed to refuse to accept second rate \u201clove\u201d at the beginning of the relationship and recognise that people ignoring her wants and or dreams but doing everything else to be an otherwise loving partner isn\u2019t loving *her*. It\u2019s fulfilling a generic, bland stereotype of love and has little to do with accepting who she is as an individual. Well actually not even..cause to me showing up for life milestones should really be the bare minimum..\n\nBut by having to accept whatever form of second rate love and attention she can get from her family, she will see anyone who focuses on solely on her as real, intense love. You\u2019re showing her and setting a precedent that she does matter and deserves loves and attention for who she is, and giving her an example that she may never consciously realise but will draw upon the rest of her life. \n\u201cHmmm I don\u2019t really like how new partner is treating me..I mean they\u2019re not hurting me but I don\u2019t feel like this is right. I feel like I deserve someone who is able to show up for me.\u201d And maybe she won\u2019t change her behaviour enough to realise at the beginning of a relationship. She may still fall into the trap of \u201cany love is good and worthwhile love\u201d.

Its pretty common and obvious that when a family is that extent, some kids endup neglected because theres no way to give attention to all of them, in your case your parents decided not to just to appeal the other daughter. All your sister will think, and the little one, is that your parents dont care about them, and soon will have most of their kids going LC or NC for just caring about one like the golden child.", "NTA and Nadia's lucky you and Leo are her brothers.", "NTA \n\nAwesome job, you are rocking it as a sibling.", "100%\n\nALSO (in case this hasn't been brought up yet) assuming current timelines, Nadia's graduation means most of her high school experience was affected by pandemic, which means this isn't just the usual coming of age marker for a teenager, but one of FEWER high school ones she likely would've had! It's a big deal.", "Yep, take your kid out of that nonsense please.", "NTA and skip the wedding for sure. If Erin is this selfish towards everyone, she\u2019ll likely have another wedding you can attend in the future anyway.", "I definitely think that the five of us (not Lexie, because she's 4) as a collective are fast approaching a point where we will have no option *but* to go low or no contact with Erin. A lot of this has taken place only over the last few days. Erin told us about the change of date about two months ago, and it's only last week that I found out she did it intentionally because Nadia didn't want to cause any trouble. The graduation and wedding are now a week away. It only came out because Leo and I were complaining about something Erin did to one of us in the past and Nadia joined in thinking it would be brushed off like everything else. But it struck me as something particularly cruel, even with all that Erin has done to monopolise our parents' attention on days that should have been about the rest of us, and I've decided to put my foot down. Maybe later than I should have. I'm hoping the rest of my siblings will come to realise that we need to stop sacrificing so much of our moments for Erin because it sets a precedent for Nadia and Lexie. I know Josh has expressed guilt in the past because he felt like if he'd spoken out more against Erin, then the rest of us wouldn't have had to concede like we so often did. I love my siblings tremendously, Erin included. But it's gotten to a point where I can't be around her without the rest of our family present.", "Leo has also committed to skipping the wedding. It'll be us, my partner, and son celebrating Nadia's graduation in the very clothes we bought for the wedding. Why not put these expensive suits to good use?", "I think that's why I'm taking a stand now. Because the rest of us *got* our graduations. Even if we barely scraped by, we got these huge celebrations where our parents told us just how proud they were of us. It was the one thing Erin couldn't touch until then (though she did try with Leo's). But seeing Nadia be pushed to the side like that really broke my heart for her. So I plan on celebrating with her, and I plan on buying her an expensive gift afterwards. We're also discussing the possibility of her moving in with me and my family permanently before she heads off to college in the fall. So then she'll have somewhere to stay without Erin being around because even though she has moved out, she's often just 'popping in' at home.", "I don't want to defend my parents because they are wholeheartedly in the wrong here. But I think they were under the impression that Erin spoke to Nadia separately when she announced the date change back in March, like they thought maybe they worked something out themselves because they thought it was an unfortunate mistake. Nadia only told me and Leo about the fact that it was intentional last week. They've otherwise been pretty good at attending/throwing events meant for each of us specifically, but unfortunately on more than one occasion, the spotlight was always turned to Erin for some reason or another. Like, as I mentioned in the post, we were celebrating Lydia's wedding anniversary and Erin thought it'd be a good idea to announce that she was engaged without consulting Lydia at all, and our parents allowed her to do that and encouraged her by being excited for her. My parents don't seem to have picked up on this pattern in Erin, and as I'm typing this I'm thinking that maybe I should write a list of as many of these instances as I can remember and confront my parents with it.", "Unfortunately, we know which of us were planned and which of us were not. Lydia wasn't planned. Josh and Leo were, but I wasn't. Then our parents decided to try for another girl, and they got their miracle. Nadia's their 'surprise gift' and Lexie's their 'blessing.' It's not so much that any of us were unwanted, just unplanned. I think our parents had Lexie assuming she'd be the baby, and then she was born premature, and they never once thought about changing their stance that she's their miracle child. They love Nadia and they love Lexie, and my mom did apologise about having to miss out on Nadia's graduation when Erin first told us about it. I think she mentioned that we could celebrate as a family after Erin came back from her honeymoon. But, things changed when Leo and I sat Erin and our parents down to tell them that Nadia wanted to attend her graduation and we were going to be there for her. Too many 'big days' have been monopolised by Erin so I want Nadia to have a day that is hers. Even if it's only celebrated by her two brothers, her brother's partner, and her nephew.", "My partner and I have committed to pulling our son from the wedding. The three of us and Leo will instead be celebrating Nadia's big day with her.", "If it was a genuine mistake, then I might have tried to balance both Nadia's graduation and Erin's wedding. I was going to figure out a way to make it work, either by skipping the ceremony and returning for the reception or celebrating either with Nadia the day before or the day after. I was planning on celebrating Nadia regardless. But after finding out last week that it was intentional, I changed my mind completely. Because unfortunately, this isn't the only instance of something like this happening. It's just the straw that broke the camel's back. I love Erin. I do. But she could have stuck to her initial wedding date. It's only a month away. Just a month's difference. But she found out about the cancellation and took that slot knowing it was the date of Nadia's graduation. Nadia told us thinking we would brush it off like we've done before, but it really hurt me. So I'm choosing to prioritise Nadia even if it means I'm ruining what relationship I have with Erin.", "There's no abuse going on whatsoever, my mother is not a violent person by any means. By cornering, I mean that she kept trying to coerce Nadia into conceding because it's Erin's 'big day.'

I will not withhold love, affection, and appreciation for Nadia's accomplishments by rewarding Erin's disgusting behavior. As a parent myself I would be ashamed if I raised a child as selfish as Erin. Until I see some evidence that you are ashamed of her behavior neither me or my child will be spending any time with you.", "It honestly sounds like your sister has all the classic symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder. NTA BTW. And celebrate the f*ck out of Nadia's grad, post nothing bit support for her on the graduation and leave out any mention of Erin or her wedding.", "Is it tho?  Feel like this is Divorce: The Prequel"]}
