There's Lydia (31f), Josh (28m), Leo (25m), me, then Erin (21f), Nadia (18f), and the surprise child Lexie (4f). With that many siblings, it's easy to get lost in the crowd. Some of us have our 'positions,' so to speak. Lydia's the oldest, Lexie's the baby, *I* have a kid (yes, that's my descriptor. OP: gave us a grandchild). Erin is the golden child. She was the last planned child, the one supposed to tie up our family. She was born premature so I understand that my parents coddled her to an extent, but it's more than that now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nErin's getting married and recently told us that she's brought the date forward due to a cancellation. No big deal, it just means they're getting married sooner. But the new date lands on the date of Nadia's HS graduation. Erin was sympathetic, but said she's already committed to the date, they've printed the invitations. My parents normally go overboard on our HS grads, but they said that they'd just have to miss Nadia's. We were all sympathetic, but it wasn't intentional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr so I thought. But Nadia later told me and Leo that she was there when Erin got the call about the cancellation and told Erin that she was graduating that day, but Erin just laughed and accepted the date anyway. This, as much as I hate to admit it, sounds like a very Erin thing to do. She booked her engagement part for the night of Nadia's 18th birthday (luckily, she wasn't celebrating until the weekend). She announced her engagement at my oldest sister's wedding anniversary. Everything is about her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI confronted Erin about this, and she said that Nadia's HS graduation didn't matter. She wanted to get married to the love of her life sooner\u2014and our family had been to plenty of HS graduations at this point, anyway. She said something like, \"we still have Lexie.\" But here's what gets me the most: Nadia's been looking forward to this for so long. She's watched all of us graduate and have these huge celebrations thrown by our parents. I asked Nadia what she wanted, and she said she wanted to have *her* day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I told my family that me and Nadia won't be attending the wedding. Leo has also dropped out. Everyone's angry. Erin's furious, and I didn't make it better by telling her that I could watch our other siblings get married, since it's all the same in her eyes. Mom's trying to convince me to come to the wedding because 'graduation isn't as important' but I feel like if I don't do this then it sets a precedent in Nadia's life that she's always going to mean less than Erin. I've had messages calling me an asshole, an idiot, etc. They're telling me to step up and be a good brother, but that's what I'm doing. My son is supposed to be ring bearer but with how my family is reacting, I'm considering pulling him out of the wedding, too. My dad's told Nadia he'll take her to dinner after the wedding.

Nadia's graduation doesn't matter *to her*...big distinction there. You are FULLY within your rights to skip her wedding as Nadia's graduation absolutely does matter. How cruel of her! I'm a little sick that your mom is just falling in line. \n\nIf you have a need for a little extra \"petty\", you can send your sister a $10 gift card to McDonald's as a wedding present.", "High School Graduations are a once in a life time thing.  You graduate you experience it once, you don't graduate, the best you get is a GED celebration later.\n\nSince like 3/5 marriages end in divorce these days I'd say there's a much better chance of Erin experiencing another wedding, than Nadia would experience another HS Grad.\n\nTypical selfish person, changing plans on everyone and expecting everyone to drop anything they might already have planned.

And I agree, sometimes you can count on people to spell TEAM with a me, me, me, me.

I can't even remember how many times we all had the family meeting where the rest of us asked our parents, \"Why do you let him get away with being such an attention \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*?\"\n\nI think ultimately the reason the nonsense stopped was because as a group, the rest of the siblings just started to push back every time favorite son acted up on us.\n\nI only explained all that to say this: I would not go to the wedding. I'd go to the high school graduation. You're an adult, so treating Nadia like her milestones have meaning is only YOUR choice. Its not anyone else's to make for you. \"Mom, you don't get to decide what's important for me to participate in. Thanks for wanting to help but, I've got this covered and it was an easy decision to make. I feel good about my plans and I hope you enjoy your day too.\"\n\nNTA.

And Leo for dropping out. \n\nNTA", "NTA, When you clarified that Erin knew it was Nadia's graduation and went ahead anyway,  after already hijacking her 18th this is not OK and someone has to turn up for Nadia for sure.

Well the one that deserves support.", "NTA who would schedule their wedding on a siblings graduation date??? I can\u2019t imagine someone doing that. That is cruel. They can GET married another date. Graduation dates cannot be changed. Text your whole family this post and pull your son out of the wedding. It was incredibly hurtful thing she did.

Thank GOD Nadia has people to advocate for her.", "NTA in the slightest. I hope you and Nadia have a great day together. Maybe you can suggest that you'll both go to Erin's next wedding? After all, if she's this unpleasant to the ones she's supposed to love, I can't imagine this marriage lasting....", "NTA - congrats to both of your sisters! It sucks that Erin has put you in this situation, but it's unfair for Nadia to miss out on the support and celebration the rest of you got because of Erin's choices.

That isn't your fault. I personally would prioritize a wedding over a graduation, but I think given your reasoning about how special HS grad parties are, it makes sense Nadia would be really upset. If you value the relationship with Nadia over Erin, then the choice is easy for you who to support. It's probably a good idea to think about who you want in your life going forward if Erin is willing to be this blatantly dismissive to other members of the family. Probably isn't the first time, probably won't be the last.", "Nta! Thank you for stepping up for your sister when no one else will", "NTA\n\nI think what struck me the most was the parents just casually saying they would miss their daughter's graduation. \n\nI'm one of 7 kids. Sometimes we had overlapping special events; with that many kids, it was kind of inevitable. My parents worked hard so as not to plan celebrations/special events on the same day. But sometimes stuff happens and the dates are beyond anyone's control. When two kids had graduations on the same day, they split up and each graduate got one parent and 2 or 3 siblings as a cheering section. \n\nWhen it happened, say the big football championship when my brother was captain of the high school football team and my other brother's birthday, they planned ahead and consulted both kids. Usually what would happen is that the birthday kid would get a small acknowledgement of the day--cards, a few gifts, a cake, and the family would go to the football game. Then on the weekend before or after the actual birthday, there would be a big birthday celebration. My parents would feel guilty about missing the \"real\" birthday and do more than they would normally do to celebrate. \n\nI remember my parents had some work obligation of Dad's that Mom also had to attend  on my 7th birthday. They planned a scavenger hunt for small gifts with my babysitter and a special dinner. Then the next day, I got the ice cream and cake and all the presents and a special trip to the Smithsonian (which for some reason was my favorite place to go back then).  Mom felt so badly about the whole thing that she was giving me little presents and food treats for a week. \n\nSo we learned that were compensations for being willing to delay a celebration for a sibling's non-movable event. \n\nComing from this background, these parents seem needlessly cruel to Nadia. Perhaps the parents can do nothing to change the new wedding date. But one of them could attend the wedding and the other the graduation, and then the graduate and parent could join the wedding festivities in progress. And then Nadia could have a nice graduation party a week later. I mean, there's a world of compromise available here. Missing their daughter's graduation is not the only option. \n\nI feel for Nadia and I am glad that she has the OP in her life.", " NTA - your Erin sounds like a narcissist, and I\u2019m sure Nadia appreciates her big brother.  \n\nI\u2019d go one step further and throw her a graduation party of her own.
