She just loves a free servant. You deserve better than that.", "NTA. Wow, not even because she had other obligations? But because she thought her kid might get bored?

That\u2019s crazy.", "\"But I'm tired of bending over backwards for her when she won't do the same.\"\n\nThat is reason enough to not baby sit for free anymore.  What has she done to help you?  To celebrate you?  When a relationship because this one-sided with support, it's perfectly fine to pull back.

Your sister is selfish and entitled. A 4 yo may not sit still for an hour, but can still try and make the effort. Your kid wants Gatorade then fucking get one. She is abusing her support system and is wondering why it is abandoning her.", "NTA. WTF? She thinks it's a legit thing to ask someone to go to the store for a Gatorade? What happened to telling the kid no? You are not being petty. At all.", "I am a college student, single mom of a 3 year old, I would totally go to your event even with kiddo. She's using you. My village is very small but I look forward to being invited to things and celebrating the people I love. I get nervous in large crowds with my DS but still try to get him out in public to learn and observe. \n\nYou are NTA at all. She is an entitled parent who is ruining for parents who do everything they can with very little and get looked down on. It may be petty, but it's realistic. I am getting GC vibes from mom and sister.", "NTA. When people continually expect you to be the only one making an effort in a relationship, that tells you all you need to know. I'd be so hurt if I were in your shoes. It may seem petty but tbh for me that would only be the start. If you can't make an effort for me once in a while, why should I make an effort for you constantly. \n\nGood on you for standing up for yourself instead of bending over backwards.", "NTA, your sister repeatedly seems to make her problems yours. She should hire a babysitter if that's what it takes to do the bare minimum for someone who sacrifices as much as you. However, understand that a lot of people probably go through what you are and this shouldn't create a permanent rift in y'all's relationship.", "Family also shows up for important events. Next time she asks for something mention that and say you thought you are not really family any longer...", "NTA. \n\nShe's an asshole for being so self-centered and one-sided, always willing to demand favors but not willing to even give a bit of her time. But it's even worse when she decides to be a petty asshole and talk crap about you publicly. Sounds like your mom's an asshole too, given that her go-to is \"give your sister whatever she wants, I don't want to deal with her tantrums\". \n\nIf your mom wants to see petty, maybe you should suggest that you respond to your sister online.  How would she feel if you publicly pointed out that she only has her kid 50% of the time but purposely schedules nail appointments during her custody so she doesn't have to spend time with her son?", "While I do feel it proper to up front agree with a little bit of \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it is like until you have a kid\u201d piece, I also agree that it isnt crippling to all facets of one\u2019s life as your sister seems to be insinuating.\n\nIs your sister going to enjoy the graduation ceremonies? Nope. She\u2019s going to be distracted and exasperated at least half the time due to a bored four year old she has to try and keep distracted and semi behaved. But, well, so what? Welcome to being a parent, sis!\n\nNTA\n\nKids are a challenge, and having two of my own I get that - but it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t try and accommodate, and it certainly doesn\u2019t mean you send someone to a store for a Gatorade for your kid! Your sister is carrying this more than a bit too far.", "She wants you to get her Gatorade??!!  What a pile of poo.

She wants all these things from you and won\u2019t return any energy for you. That\u2019s unfair and just not cool in general. Energy matched energy and I feel like you\u2019re being realistic in not going out of your way is she won\u2019t do something for you that\u2019s really important for you. I hope she changes her mind and comes to your graduation because it\u2019s a big deal and something you worked extremely hard to achieve. It\u2019s only right for her to celebrate your huge accomplishments if she wants you to help her consistently. Congratulations btw!", "NTA. A lot of people forget that the village is a two way street. Too many entitled parents want their villagers to bend over backwards for them but won't do the same.", "NTA. You are completely justified in returning energy.", "NTA. Looks like you\u2019re sister got attention \u2026 just not the attention she thought she deserved. Match that energy!", "NTA. It is exhausting to constantly give support without giving support back.\n\nThis wasn't approached well. Instead you could have had a conversation where you explained that your feelings were hurt, and you felt that your needs were not being met. That when your needs aren't met, it's hard to keep putting energy into meeting her needs as well. That having a child puts extra strain on a person, but it's ok to still need her to put some energy into maintaining your sister relationship despite the fact that she has a kid.\n\nIt was not OK for her to post those things after all you and your family have done for her", "NTA: Sounds fair.", "NTA. Honestly? Good for you. There\u2019s this whole thing about \u201cone upping\u201d people that don\u2019t - or can\u2019t - have kids and it\u2019s an absurd and stupid thing to do, i.e you can never be as tired as a parent. Yes, having a village is an amazing thing and can make parenting so much easier, but as a parent you are never entitled to anyone else\u2019s time but your own or your partners and child. If she wants to go post that she hasn\u2019t a village when she apparently does, let her. She\u2019ll find out soon enough that never gets her far. You receive what you put out in the world, and she\u2019s taking advantage of you.", "NTA. Sounds like you've done way more than should be reasonably expected given that she's not reciprocating in any way.", "NTA your sister is petty", "NTA. It sounds like your sister feels overworked because her parenting is terrible (she doesn't want to parent her child so she simply avoids his very normal \"negative\" behavior as much as possible - hence the refusing to go to the graduation to avoid dealing with a bored, energetic child, hence the asking someone to bring a soft drink just because the kid wants one). \n\nAs a mother with one son only two years older than her: she's being entitled, and no village is willing to help you raise a child when you are so conceited, unappreciative, and unwilling to reciprocate.", "NTA - If there is one thing that I hate the most it\u2019s parents who chose to have kids and now feel entitled to have a \u00ab\u00a0village\u00a0\u00bb. You decided to have a kid, you take care of it ! If people offer their help, that\u2019s great, but if they don\u2019t then suck it up because it\u2019s your problem ! Your sister is an untitled brat !", "NTA. Your sister is a taker you have to decide how much you are going to allow her to take. I would back away slowly and only do what you want. Best of luck and congrats on your graduation.", "NTA, as a parent you have to plan when you take your kids out. But unless the child has special needs that makes new environment difficult there's absolutely no excuse why you can't attend something like a graduation with them. I've taken my kids with me to MY rehearsal when my husband was away but I needed to be there. I set them up with playing games on my phone (sound off) and drawing materials and they were fine. Your sister should make an effort for you, especially since you often help her out.", "NTA. You're not being petty at all. Your sister is just acting entitled. I'd bet that the petty comment from your mother is down to her knowing that your sister acts this way, and won't change. So she has to lean on you to \"fix\" the family dynamic.", "NTA. My older sister is graduating college next week and I\u2019m going with my 1 year old. You make the effort for those who support you. Even if I have to step away for a minute when he gets rowdy, it doable. My sister is my village and I\u2019m going to see her walk across that stage come hell or high water. I\u2019m sorry your sister is treating you this way but congratulations on your accomplishment.", "NTA \n\nThe whole \u201cit takes a village\u201d implies that everyone works to help everyone else out. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want a village. She wants a freaking castle where she\u2019s the queen and everyone else is her loyal subjects who\u2019s primary function is to fulfill her wants and needs.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nNothing wrong with a little petty. I love it. Your sister sounds very lazy. Seems like she relies too much on other people to care for her son. If she only has him a few days a week then she can get her nails done on days she doesn't have him. He needs a drink, she can take him to the store and get it. That's not your job. I'd stop doing favors all together for awhile. If she can't go to your graduation and making excuses, then you have every right to match her energy. The fact that people with kids thinks that people with no kids are less busy or work less hard is ridiculous. It's like if you're kid free you can't have a life. Not okay.", "NTA. She\u2019s manipulative and full of shit. We had two kids (now adults). We managed to raise them without manipulating friends and family into thinking they owed us everything, and we owed them nothing.", "NTA- Pick up a Gatorade and drop it off because your nephew wanted it? What in the actual entitled crazy is that kind of request? That is WAY over use of \u201chelping out family\u201d. \n\nYou get what you give. I think your sister hearing No is a great think. She obviously needs to hear it more often. She doesn\u2019t even have her kids half the time. I tell her you are happy help her when she REALLY needs it, but the days of taking advantage of your kindness in the name of \u201chelping family\u201d are over. \n\nI bet when you have kids she will will not help you and still say things like \u201cyou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a single mom\u201d even though she only has her kids half the week.", "NTA, you just have self-respect. Let her get her own kid juice. Ugh to say that to you when you watch the kid often too, like you wouldn\u2019t understand her kid\u2019s attention span.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want a village, a village requires participation from everyone - what she wants is a staff, an unpaid one at that.", "NTA. She sounds very entitled her kid is her responsibility not yours or anyone else\u2019s.

And people who just use the \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t understand\u201d line are just the worst.", "Uhh, if you want a village, you have to *support* it.", "LOL, it is PETTY and I LOVE IT!", "NTA\n\nThough you are being petty. \n\nBeing in the village doesn 't mean people serve you, you also have to be part of the village by being present and contributing.

I'm a full time graduate student and work part time.\n\nLong story short my sister basically has this attitude that because I don't have kids there is no possible way I am as busy or work as hard as she does. She expects me to bend over backwards to help her, and whenever I can, I do because I believe that's what family does. I've delivered food, babysat, my husband has fixed her truck for free, ect. \n\nWell, my graduation is next month, and I invited my sister to come. She has a 4 year old and we're all pretty close. She and her ex have shared parenting so she has the child 3-4 days a week.  She says she can't come to my graduation because her son will be bored and she doesn't want to deal with that.  I told her it's only about an hour (it's a small program- there's only 15 of us) and other kids will be there and that it wouldn't be a big deal if he made noise or whatever. Which is true, we were told the whole thing is family friendly and there will be treats, ect. She still was adamant that it would be too much work for her as he won't sit still and I \"don't get it because I don't have a kid\". That's her go to line when i disagree with her. \n\nI didn't respond and tried to let it go, but it really hurt my feelings. This was like a final straw for me as she has a habit of using my nephew as an excuse for things she just doesn't care to go to. This was two weeks ago and she has asked me for a couple favors since then, and I said no. Last week she asked me to go to the store and pick up a gatorade and drop it off because her son really wanted one and I told her I was busy. Yesterday she asked me to come watch my nephew so she could go get her nails done, and I said no. \n\nShe asked what was going on with me and I told her I was matching her energy. That family makes effort for family and if she couldn't make effort for me I wasn't going to for her. She responded and said \"wow, I guess the village really is dead\". She's been posting online about how she has no village, and people turn their backs on parents and people have been messaging me asking what up (because she has a HUGE village. we have a huge family and we all help her out) I explained to my mom what happened and she thinks I'm being petty. \n\nI really don't see it as being petty, I'm not trying to hurt my sister. But I'm tired of bending over backwards for her when she won't do the same.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
