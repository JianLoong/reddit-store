Growing up I never imagined that James wasn't my full brother because my mom adored him so much. Eventually, my mom found out that my dad cheated again but this time followed through with the divorce.\n\nJames and I were very upset about what our dad did but James seemed especially angry and often clashed with our dad about it and in a fit of rage he told James that my mom wasn't his real mother. My mom tearfully admitted to the truth when confronted. James was 16 at the time and it was always my mom's intention to tell James the truth at 18 but he was still upset on the matter. Out of spite James didn't go to college like my mom wanted and moved in with friends, barely talking to either parent.\n\nEventually it was discovered that James had reconnected with his bio mom and to make herself look good she painted my mom as a crazy woman who forced her to give James up so she could get a baby and James believed her. At 21 he called my mom an evil woman and wanted nothing to do with her ever again and she broke down. I became estranged from James over this, especially since he found it in his heart to resume a relationship with our dad.\n\nLast year my mom found out that she had cancer and when she tried to reach out to James he sent her a voicemail reiterating that he thought that she was the worst and, again, wanted nothing to do with her. She didn't even get the chance the tell him that she was sick. I was enraged but my mom begged me not to say anything to James or my dad, that she had finally accepted he didn't love her anymore and just wanted to focus on her health. I honored her wishes and when she found out that she was terminal my mom still insisted on not reaching out to James.\n\nShe passed away and I was so angry that I didn't even tell James or my dad about the funeral. Well James found out and image my surprise when he called me in rage about not knowing that my mom was sick and how he didn't know about the funeral until weeks after it had happened. I hung up and sent him a copy of last voicemail he ever sent her before blocking him. A few days later I had to go to court because James was suing me over my mom's estate but he got nothing.

The courts have even decided in your favor, believe people when they tell you that you aren\u2019t wrong here. \n\nI also understand none of this makes the situation better.

Your mom loved him and did what his bio mom couldn\u2019t for many years. He should have forgiven her for not telling him she wasn\u2019t his bio mom or at the most COMMUNICATED with your mom about his feelings and why he felt them so they could have discussed it and resolved it. He sounds immature and instead of listening to your mom the second time around, he shut her out without listening. Those are his choices and what happened as a result of them are the consequences he has to face. And he was estranged from her for years and called her horrible names and still expected something? He honestly sounds toxic.", "Hell no, NTA. He chose to go no contact, so he can't be mad no one contacted him.", "HARD NTA", "NTA F your brother and father, seriously. Continue staying NC with them and don't give them a dime. Live your best life. One day, he'll find out the truth and it'll be too late. Screw them all.", "Of course you're NTA.

He had his chance to learn about her illness and wouldn't talk to her. So be it.", "NTA\n\nFor James it will all be about how he\u2019s the victim. And money. He chose his path.

Again im so sorry ...Hugs!!", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA this is very sad. im sorry for your loss", "NTA", "Wow. NTA in a heartbeat. James is the biggest AH and your dad.", "NTA, and even more so after seeing your comments about the birth certificate. He is acting entitled after he destroyed your mother. I hope you kept the voicemails etc for court too because that will add even more credence to why she left him nothing.", "NTA and based on him immediately trying to sue you for money it seems like he\u2019s just mad he missed the opportunity to weasel his way back into her estate while she was dying.

Your father is TA here.", "You honored your mother's last wishes. NTA.", "YTA", "My condolences for your loss. The whole situation was a no win for pretty much everyone involved, but you did right by your mother. James gave up any claim to his estate when he chose estrangement and no contact.

He's not feeling anything but greed.", "NTA.\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss, I empathize with you. It was her wish for James and your \"Dad\" not to know that she was sick and You didn't want them to know about her funeral. \n\nAlso, what did James think he was gonna get from suing you? He is in contact with BOTH of his parents.

Hopefully he'll leave you alone to your grief.", "So basically he not upset about your mom death but losing an inheritance which technically isn\u2019t even his.  NTA but your half brother is definitely an AH.", "He was greedy and entitled, and was likely betting on the possiblity of you folding and paying him off rather than go through a lawsuit. A lot of people and companies choose to settle rather than go through a lengthy court battle that could drag on for years and run up lawyer fees.

Your mother accepted a child that wasn\u2019t hers, she raised him as her son, but how he paid all the love she gave him, with hate. \nHopefully everything on your life goes better and stay away from toxic people.", "NTA. He made his wishes quite clear, to the point of making your mother cry when she was already ill. He would have known about it if he had, st any point, sat down and asked her side of the story instead of instantly believing a stranger (bio-mom) as well as a lying cheat (dad). What's tragic is if he had taken half an hour he could have figured out who was telling the truth and who wasn't. Instead he lashed out at the woman who, by all rights had every reason not to treat him as her own, loved him and cherished him. Now he wants to throw a temper tantrum? Nope, sorry buddy but that ship has sailed. He really needs a swift kick in the pants. You, however, have nothing for which to feel bad.", "NTA\n\nHowever, lies like this tend to blow up badly. I\u2019m not willing to call your brother an A H either. His parents lied to him for 16 years.", "NTA.

Maybe in time you two can talk again. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your brother believed lies and hurt your mom in the process. He refused to reconcile and now wants to cash in. Even if he feels guilty, suing you isn\u2019t going to solve anything.", "NTA - Wow, first, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and that you had to go through that without the support of your dad or brother. But you respected your moms wishes. Sending him the voicemail rather than you voicing your justification was the perfect move. And instead of that being a reminder to him of how hurtful he was to your mom, he took you to court. I\u2019m curious though why he took you to court knowing it was futile.", "NTA at all. Your half brother just sounds greedy. So sorry for your loss!", "He\u2019s a greedy asshole. You seem lovely. So sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f", "James is angry. What does it have to do with you? Not a goddamn thing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA \n\nWould love to see an update after a court shut down your half brother lawsuit", "NTA\n\nJames sounds like a bad, overly-reactive person who has taken after his bio mom and dad. He tanked his entire life out of spite. Just like his dad did.\n\nThe little flourish of sending him the voicemail was chef's kiss.\n\nI wonder if his lawsuit wasn't a bizarre attempt to force your mom to be his mom again in some official, recognized capacity, but the ship has sailed and he is stuck with his choices.", "NTA in any way shape or form.  Cut James out forever.", "NTA.\n\nHe disavowed your Mom. She tried to patch things up. He refused. She disowned him. None of that was your choice.\n\n>He's still angry at me for not telling him about my mom's passing or the funeral so AITA?\n\nSeriously? You have to ask if this is anything other than 100% his fault? You're very kind-hearted.\n\nWould you have wanted your mom to be put through more heartbreak while she was dying? I assume not. You're a good person. Honoring your mom's finish wish by not saying anything to James or your dad was the right thing to do.", "NTA and if James legally removed your mother from his birth certificate and replaced it with his Bio Mother. \n\nAt best James was a distant ex relative to your mother. You owed him nothing.\n\nSo so sorry for your loss also.", "he has a lot of nerve to expect smth after treating the women bad who raised him and gave him a life. instead he crawled back to his cheating father and the women who gave him up. but suuuure be mad at op. what a joke. I want him to remember the pain and betrayal cz that\u2019s what he made his mom feel. May she Rest In Peace.", "Yeah, how very telling that his grieving process was to sue and try to lay claim to part of her estate. OP's mother was the only true victim in that mess of a marriage, yet James blames her for what his father and bio mother did? Both of whom he chooses to have a relationship with? \n\nI'm so sorry for OP's mother and all the heartbreak she had to endure through all those years, especially right before her passing. But I'm not the least bit sorry for James, he got what he wanted (and deserved). \n\nNTA", "He doesn\u2019t feel guilt\u2014just greed", "James is that you", "OP it's greed that is motivating him to take you to court over a perceived windfall, nothing more.  It's entitlement that makes him overlook his actions, so others must overlook them too because he is entitled.", "Well he fucked around and found out didn\u2019t he! OP you are NTA you gave him what he wanted his bio mom.", "He very well could have called and lashed out in anger because of guilt. Yes, taking OP to court is full of greed. He can feel both at the same time, and also separately.", "I'm adopted. My only birth certificate lists my adoptive parents. My understanding in my state is that adopting permanently changes that document and anything with the birth parents is expunged", "He cut her off and her last wishes were for none of these people to know she was sick or dead. Definitely NTA. Twice as an adult he made it crystal clear that he was absolutely done with your mom. Well when you cut people off that means you don't get to reconcile when they are dying or welcome at their funeral.", "NTA and James is the ass who just wants money now.", "NTA\n\nWhat a mess. I\u2019m so sorry for all that you and your mother endured.", "NTA.  I'm sorry your brother hurt your mother so badly, especially in her last months.  He is obviously not a good person, so you did the right thing.", "Counter sue for infliction of emotional distress", "NTA He refused to listen when she called to tell him. He was the aggressor. He was wrong. He doesn't get to turn around and cry foul. He's no one to blame but himself.", "NTA He stated he didn't want contact with your mom. Your mom did not want you to contact James. You honored both of their wishes.", "op=NTA\n\nYou were honoring your mother's wishes before her death and your wishes after her death.\n\nWhy should you reach out to him after what he did to your mother?\n\nHowever in good REDDIT Conspiracy fashion.  His Bio-Mom could have been correct(from her perspective).  You weren't born yet and I doubt your parents discussed any of this until after Daddy dearest told James the \"Truth\" of his birth.\n\nIE you mother might have told husband that conditional on staying with him, he had to try for (shared) custody of child, or some such.  Not saying that's what happened. but its doubtful that you'll ever know the \"Truth\" if it was something like that, because your father is clearly the king of manipulation.", "Honestly, because while my mom said she didn't want James to know about her health she didn't say I couldn't invite him to the funeral. I just didn't out of spite.", "That honestly makes sense in some twisted way because there was no way he was ever going to win because he replaced my mom on his birth certificate, had multiple posts on his social media acknowledging the other woman as his mom, and I was able to provide multiple witnesses on my mom's side and a few of her friends who could testify to his lack of a relationship with my mom years before her death. Even still had the final voicemail he sent her.", "Honestly, I feel like we're past the point of no return. I just can't get over how he treated my mom.", "Well it's already been settled. He got nothing because A) He had my mom removed from his birth certificate B) My lawyer was able to pull social media posts about how he viewed the other woman as his mom and C) I was able to present witnesses who could attest to his lack of a relationship with my mom years before his death", "> He cut her off and her last wishes were for none of these people to know she was sick or dead.\n\nTechnically, she didn't say I couldn't tell James about her death or not invite him to the funeral. Once she was terminal my mom told me that I had free rein to do whatever I needed to do to function. I just didn't tell James out of spite, which is part of the reason why I feel like I might be TA.", "He's angry that I didn't tell him that my mom was sick or even about the funeral and, technically, I could've let him know about her death since my mom didn't say anything about not letting him come. I can admit I was being spiteful in that.", "your mom was a pure soul. forgiving the cheater + taking in/adopting his kid + raising him and loving him as her own just to get betrayed like that. Wish her peace.", "Some people just have more anger than they know what to do with.", "Look, we\u2019d all like to think we\u2019d extend grace to all people in all circumstances, but it\u2019s okay to act in self protection and refuse to extend grace sometimes. James knowing about your mother\u2018s funeral would have only added more stress and possible drama during an already terrible time. Imagine the opportunities for cruelty you did not give him. What a gift you gave to your mother\u2019s most loving child instead. NTA.    I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "I understand, especially after so many years\u2026", "Wow, so he got slapped down 9 ways from Sunday. \n\nGood, he deserved it.", "Still going with NTA because he told your mother twice as an adult that he wanted nothing to do with her. She was dying and if she wanted your brother involved then she would have found a way.", "If this is really what you think, why do so many people that are adopted at birth have to hunt down who their birth parents are, so many people have to get things like DNA test to even get a name."]}
