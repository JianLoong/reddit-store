Here\u2019s the thing from the friends perspective. He has someone in his life he trusts and respects who could be the reason he gets to have a baby with his wife. I mean sure they could find a donor egg (I believe\u2026) but it might mean more to both of them to know they\u2019re surrounded by people loving and supporting this next step in their life. \n\nOn the other hand. Of course hearing an ex is requesting this is going to make you feel uncomfortable. You\u2019re anticipating them bringing up the fact that it\u2019s biologically your girlfriends kid. That can make anyone uncomfortable but it doesn\u2019t make you jealous but possibly does show some insecurities that are honestly normal in this situation. You showed your support but also gave your honest opinion on it and she disrespected you. Hopefully you can return to this conversation and smooth things over.", "NTA\nbeing a person who also has a great relationship with my ex I don\u2019t think you\u2019re overreacting\u2026 It is really strange to think that her ex, who still in your guys life, will have a children with her DNA etc \nbesides of that, there\u2019s a lot of people who does that kind of donation\u2026 and may I\u2019m tripping but it should better to be someone who be related with his wife (?) \nbut in fact I think you\u2019re absolutely right to feel uncomfortable, it is really strange", "NTA, to be honest everyone else in this story seems off. I don't get how she can say you're jealous when you have no problem with being friends with someone who dated your gf dated for 11 years and they had only broke up 2 years before you started dating. Like doing that is the complete opposite of jealous, but it is a little weird for sure. Heck it'd make sense for younger sister to provide the egg, then it would be as close to both Ryan and his wife genetically as they can pretty much get.", "NTA - I\u2019m donor conceived and not a single person in this scenario is thinking about the child. I know there are going to be comments giving you shit about her bodily autonomy and saying you don\u2019t get a say, but I certainly think you are entitled to an opinion. If you have kids with this woman they will have a biological sibling out there, this decision would always be an impact on your life.", "NTA. \n\nShe asked. You answered. As a rule, by default, answering questions honestly doesn't make you a bad person. \n\nAlso: \n\nThey dated for eleven years, and now they want to have a child together. \n\nAs an internet stranger who doesn't know any of you I'm not qualified to answer this, but ask yourself: why her? Is there something more to this?", "NTA. There are other options for donors.", "NTA. Donating sperm or eggs is not to be taken lightly. This would be her kid running around out there. Are the parents planning on telling kiddo the info? How will any of you feel if kid is a spitting image of your wife?  So many questions to be considered before making this life changing decision.", "NTA. Why is she insisting so much to be their donor? It's normal to feel uncomfortable is a situation like this. Also you didn't tell her that you won't support her if she agrees to be the donor. So why did she get mad? I'd try to talk to her once more to clarify the situation and then see how she reacts.", "NTA. \nI suggest you consider ending this relationship. She's going to have an attachment to the child for sure, and you're gonna develop some resentment about the situation for sure. \n\nAnd the fact that she called you insecure to your face after asking you your opinion makes her sound like a b**ch.", "You are not crazy I would be absolutely livid and I was in your shoes and she went ahead I wouldn\u2019t even continue with the relationship. They should buy donor eggs why are they asking her, I find it highly inappropriate.", "NTA- you should also suggest to your gf that there are other concerns.   \nIf she hasn't already she should look into how donor conceived people feel. There are groups, support groups for them, information for those considering, all that.   \nI would just really encourage her to do a lot of research from the viewpoint of donor conceived people.   \nIt's also really important that Ryan and his wife are able to seek therapy to deal with the news of infertility before taking further steps towards building a family in other ways, they do not want to pass on their own trauma to a child.", "NTA. You recognize that it is ultimately her choice and said you would support her decision. She asked how you feel about the situation and you answered.", "Nta.  I would feel weird about it but honestly not your decision.", "NTA. But she already made her plan and this wasn\u2019t asking your permission. It was simply a courtesy to inform you.

One ex (they dated for a year ending almost 10 years ago) asked him 5 years ago for sperm to have a kid by herself. That was before we met but I\u2019m so glad he didn\u2019t agree because we just had our first child and seeing the kind of dad he is there\u2019s no way he could\u2019ve not been involved with that child.

But egg donation is no joke it takes a big toll on your body and might be more complex than she realizes. Egg donors (at least in my US state) have to have a psych eval before donating because it\u2019s so intense. Even for anonymous donation. This is a heavy thing to consider.", "NTA. Confused the point of different surrogate/different donor. Her younger sister isn't donating the egg for what reason?? That's as close to genetically theirs anyway.\n\nWhole situation would make me uncomfortable, too, just in how close everyone is. Ultimately, the child is biologically hers but it's not her kid.

I can sort of see both sides-she thinks she\u2019s helping a friend but, from your side, she\u2019s having her ex\u2019s baby. A pregnancy/birth is a huge commitment for yourself, it\u2019s not a normal/friendly gesture toward an ex.

I couldn't do it.", "That\u2019s even weirder that you\u2019re getting brought into the tail end of the discussion.  How much time has she spent talking with her ex about making a baby together?!", "Right, but that brings up a different possible struggle if suddenly that child wants a much closer relationship with OP and OP's wife.", "If it's not anger issues, then it seems like she \"asked\" for your opinion because she wanted you to agree with her and/or praise her.\n\nIf she actually wanted your opinion, then her reaction is not normal.", "No, sister\u2019s the surrogate, they want OP\u2019s gf\u2019s eggs.", "OP said sis is going to be the surrogate.", "Two years is not \"very new\", and marriage is a piece of paper. \n\nShe didn't have to discuss it - though really one can argue that we're not ever technically obligated to do anything, rendering your assertion meaningless - but hiding major life decisions like *producing a child* from your partner is generally considered poor form.", "I don\u2019t really see what difference being married makes. We\u2019re in a committed relationship regardless.", "The child would understand that OP\u2019s gf only gave their parents the biological material they needed to make them, but she is in no way their mother. This is no different from an adoption.", "Yes 2 years is very new, there are high school couples who have dated longer than that. And marriage is more than a piece of paper if it's a real marriage, it's a commitment. Being someone's GF or BF is temporary 99% of the time so I wouldn't say they are partners at all.", "True, you can be committed without marriage, I agree. It was more the \"new relationship\" part, and 2 years is very new, so in my opinion being BF and GF doesn't mean you have to ask permission or share everything, especially when only 5% of BF/GF relationships last long term.", "You're not wrong, and  agree. That's what I'm saying though, these can have hosts of issues and unintended responsibilities that OP may not want. OP's wife may or may not have fully thought them through, but given its only been a day probably is just looking at the initial implications.", "No, the child wouldn\u2019t necessarily \u201cunderstand\u201d that.

As opposed to a fake one? \n\nWhat delineates fake marriages from real ones, then? The emotional commitment?

She would probably be a huge part of the child\u2019s life regardless of who the egg donor is.", "I guess it depends on your perspective; lots of high schoolers date the same person for 2 years, I wouldn't call that a committed relationship either. From the perspective of being married well over 20 years, I consider 2 years a short-term relationship at best. Maybe they'll be together in 2 more years, maybe they won't'; research suggests only 5% of BF/GF situations last.", "Ture, couples can be committed without marriage, I agree. And in some states just living together long enough is considered marriage (common-law marriage).  As for studies, HER magazine referred to a peer reviewed study of 2000 men and 2000 women; the average was 19 bf/gf/dating/relationships before marriage, so I was a bit off, it's 5% of couples that end in marriage, not 1%.", "You're right, sounds like she'd be fine with it. Also my b on the GF and not wife thing.", "2 years in a HS relationship is even longer term. That\u2019s forever in a life stage where you\u2019re often infatuated with a new person every few months.", "If you insist on solely reviewing the success of relationships by legal status - I'm not sure what point your reference to common law marriage was supposed to address - I'd say you've very sorely missed the point of relationships. \n\nRelationships and experiences are not rendered less meaningful simply because they end; concurrently, a marriage is not more meaningful just because it lasts. Or just because it exists. \n\nMarriage isn't some \"win condition\" at fulfilment of which you can say that a relationship is worth something.", "But you don't expect it to last either, that's kind of my point. 2 years is way too short to know if you're going to stay with that person or not so best to be cautious about intertwining your lives too much that early. Doesn't mean you are going to leave at the drop of a hat, just that for example, you probably shouldn't give up a life changing opportunity if it meant moving away from that person.", "No, I think you missed my point, maybe I said it badly...  2 years is a very new relationship, and 95% of BF/GF relationships don't last (peer reviewed study in 2020). She was considerate to talk to him first, but not obligated to do so. Oh and the common law part was to acknowledge that even the government recognizes long term stable relationships legally. I totally agree that relationships are not less meaningful if they end 100%... I never meant to say anything otherwise.", ">Oh and the common law part was to acknowledge that even the government recognizes long term stable relationships legally.\n\nIt shouldn't. The government needs to concern itself less with what we do in our bedrooms, not more. \n\nAnd I understood your point, I just don't agree with it, to put it charitably.\n\nTwo years is not that new, and relationships statistically not lasting is not an excuse for poor treatment. \n\nNobody is really obligated to do anything. Redditors have this bizarre philosophical thrust of \"nobody is obligated to anyone\", which, while in some ontological sense being true, also makes the very concept of \"obligation\" meaningless. This sub isn't \"have I technically breached some ill-defined legal rule\", it's \"have I been a dick\". \n\nWe have established a largely unwritten code of social behaviours to live by, however, and by those standards omitting to mention major life choices from a significant other is generally considered a party foul.", "NTA. The girlfriend is just being silly tbh. As are the ex and his wife. They have an argument in 5 years and someone brings up well the kid is already yours and your ex's, why don't you just get back together....\n\nPeople argue, they say dumb things, jealousy will happen even if unintentional and brief.\n\nMost people pick a sister(or brother if his swimmers are the problem) if they are willing because it would be a close genetic match and feel like having a kid from the family or they go for a random donor because there are no risks of feelings being hurt or involved at all. Picking an ex is a recipe for absolute disaster. Like how blind do you have to be to not see the potential pitfalls here?", "NTA, she needs to go through a bunch of the post here where friends and family that donated and lived to regret it.", "NTA not all jealously is a bad thing. Creating a kid with and for an ex of 10 years is a huge personal, emotional commitment. I wouldn't support it. You're more generous than I am, frankly", "YTA divorce... shes an independent woman that can make her own decisions. You have no right to have feelings of your own. No but seriously put the pants on and tell her you dont like it, be a man lol", "You definitely are NTA, and realistically, I'd be questioning the relationship at that point. She asked for your opinion, then attacked and belittled you for giving it.\n\nI think your misgivings are very, very valid, and normal. For many people, myself included, this situation would be a dealbreaker, even without her invalidating your opinion. \n\nA child is *forever*, and if they have a relationship as close as all that, do you really think she won't be involved in it's life?", "NTA But this arrangement has disaster written all over it. Using family and friends for something like this can go wrong in dozens of ways they aren\u2019t considering. First, does her sister already have children? Surrogates through a legitimate agency are required to have already given birth and have their own children. They need to be aware of pregnancy and be psychologically healthy to give up the baby. Next, even if your girlfriend feels she is helping her ex, seeing a child that looks like her might be cause unexpected emotions, and donating eggs requires daily hormone injections that are difficult. And if the couple breaks up, your girlfriend can be legally responsible and forced to pay child support. Even if all four sign contracts, they aren\u2019t legal unless they use a licensed surrogacy agency. It sounds like the couple can\u2019t afford the cost of an agency, but egg retrieval and IVF implantation are still expensive. But apparently they have all made up their minds and you either accept it or consider it a dealbreaker with your gf.", "NTA. You need to insist that she does not do it or else that relationship is over. Definitely shitty to have her ex parent a child with her DNA before you do. \nThat would be an instant dealbreaker for me.", "This is one of the more one sided NTA\u2019s I\u2019ve seen in a longggggggg time.  It\u2019s a weird scenario and you gave your honest answer. NTA and it is very, very weird.", "NTA\n\nyou would be the ah if you tried to stop her but you even told her you'd support her choice, like wth, honestly expressing your comfort or discomfort levels with big life decisions when asked is normal healthy relationship behaviour? She's so messed up for lashing out at you for the crime of feeling uneasy, like bizarre, the name calling, the tension, the blame game. Ugh. It's so unnecessary and immature.", "I'm firmly in the camp that some jealousy is a good thing. If he didn't care at all, he wouldn't want to protect the relationship with his girlfriend. \"Don't make a kid with your ex\" falls in the camp of \"reasonable jealousy\" to me", "How does the ex\u2019s wife feel about this? My husband and I went through fertility treatment and before we were successful considered donor eggs, but there is no way in hell I would have considered accepting his ex\u2019s eggs! I don\u2019t even care if it would be free and save $40k. No way. Way to rub it in her face that she can\u2019t give him genetic offspring, he has to go get half the DNA from his ex-girlfriend. I would rather have a stranger donate or adopt.", "> the child would understand \n\nA lot of children would absolutely NOT understand that at all, and regardless of the reason for donation, that she's biologically the mother is still a fact and that might make the kid interested in a motherly relationship, that's simple a normal possible outcome.\n\nThere are a shedloads of adopted kids who become desperate to find out about their adoptive parents and want a relationship despite having been given up. I have no idea why you'd conclude that a child would simply accept this and not care about who their bio mother was.", "OP\u2019s gf is considering donating eggs to her best friend and his wife. As long as they\u2019re friends, she will be a part of this child\u2019s life. She will be available to answer any questions the child has. DNA isn\u2019t what makes a person a parent. Loving, supporting and nurturing a child every day of your life is what makes you a parent.", "I never said the child wouldn\u2019t care. I said the child would understand. You\u2019re acting like I said when the child is informed of their biological parentage they\u2019ll  just say \u201ccool\u201d and move on. Of course they will be have questions and will want to talk to OP\u2019s gf but as long as the adults in their life are being open and transparent, they will accept that their parents are OP\u2019s gf\u2019s best friend and his wife and OP is the woman who donated her eggs.", "She would literally be giving up her child though even if she remains in that child\u2019s life. As a donor conceived person I can tell you it\u2019s deeply painful to know one of my parents chose to \u201cdonate\u201d me. It\u2019s not just about answering questions it\u2019s about having an open relationship with and being accountable to the person you have chosen to create.", "What happens if OP has a child, what comes of the relationship between donor child and sibling? What if OP becomes attached to donor child and wife is uncomfortable with the relationship? It seems like there are a lot of possibilities where things can get complicated. What if OP disagrees with how they are raising their child and feels she has more of a say?", "This child will have a relationship with OP\u2019s gf. She\u2019s best friends with the father, so whether OP\u2019s gf decides to donate her eggs or not, she\u2019s going to be apart of this child\u2019s life. It sounds like the intended parents are being very thoughtful with the way they\u2019re going about this. They\u2019re choosing an egg donor and a surrogate they\u2019re very close to and would therefore be close to their child", "If OP\u2019s gf has kids, good for her. The kids can be friends if they want and just like OP\u2019s gf\u2019s formed would have told their child about the egg donor situation, OP\u2019s gf will do the same. As for everything else, they\u2019ll have to set clear boundaries before the child is born. Adoptions within families or friend groups is nothing new. That\u2019s basically what this is.", "NTA. For more support for your side: If you and GF ever have a child, your child will be the half-sibling of the donor/surrogate baby. It doesn't have to be weird, but it may very well be weird to be around a child that is your child's half-sibling and belongs to GF's ex. Especially because you apparently see them a lot.", "NTA. I'm doing IVF currently and it's such a big deal for all parties to be on the same page when it comes to decisions like donors/ surrogates. It's a two Yes, one No kind of decision. Now, that being said, since you guys aren't married (and really, even if you were) she has every right to go off and do it on her own, but you have every right not to continue in this relationship if she doesn't respect your feelings.", "If your uncomfortable with than your uncomfortable with it the one who\u2019s the ahole is your \u201cwife\u201d for trying to force you in a situation you don\u2019t want to be in. And I would be side eyeing her as well maybe she still love her ex, cause ain\u2019t no way would I be a surrogate to my ex\u2019s children \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. It\u2019s a pretty big decision to make, and should be made by both spouses* if one of them wants to donate genetic material to someone else. Add in the fact that this someone else is an ex-boyfriend and it just gets weirder.\n\nEdit: misread the post whoops. Still NTA, but I thought there was a bigger commitment between OP and the girlfriend.", "Honestly. Considering how quickly she jumped to you being jealous, I would be worried there's actually something to be jealous about. NTA.", "You seem to be under the impression that you have to support her decision no matter what. I don't think that's the case...", "NTA She\u2019s already been through multiple discussions with them and has already decided but she \u201casked\u201d you as more of a \u201cI\u2019m doing it anyway but I suppose it\u2019s polite to ask\u201d kind of thing.\n\nI couldn\u2019t do it, whether or not she is giving birth to the child, she is still asking you to have a child with her ex and you will have to look at that child for the rest of your lives.  Also the fact that her first child isn\u2019t with you it\u2019s someone she loved (possibly still does from the sound of things) but the ex that is still around everyday.\n\nIf she decides to go ahead despite knowing how you feel I\u2019d rethink this relationship.  The wife\u2019s sister could easily be the mother as then the child would be closer biologically to his wife and a better match but they specifically asked for your wife to do it, something is odd with this tbh.", "NTA", "I wonder if it\u2019s a money thing. Egg donors can get between $5000-$10,000, but they are asking a friend to do them a solid for free, as social pressure maybe? OP didn\u2019t mention compensation.", "Exactly, why doesn't the sister, who is apparently willing to be the surrogate, also donate the egg? They could go with artificial insemination instead of IVF which would be cheaper and easier on everyone's bodies.", "especially as the wife's younger sister is going to be carrying the child .... and presumably has shared DNA with the wife, so any genetic traits would be already in the family", "Wife? They're BF/GF, not partners, SO's, or married. No force involved; he can leave if he doesn't like it.", "To clarify, they aren't married or partners, just BF/GF in a relatively new relationship.\n\nEdit: OP didn't specifically address the level of commitment directly, but he deliberately used BF/GF, that's socially accepted to mean a lesser commitment, not as serious, and likely not permanent (5% of BF/GF couples last).  Using partner would mean a much higher level of commitment (shared home, long term stable relationship, \"life partner\").", "Birth defects if he's the biological father and it's his sister donating. But she can be the surrogate without any issues", "Thanks, that\u2019s what I get for browsing Reddit on the night shift.", "lol I've done my share of late-night Reddit-ing too. I do agree, OP is NTA though.", "You think someone in a relationship of two years shouldn't \"have to even discuss\" having a child with another person with their partner?  \n\nIn what healthy relationship does that make any sense?", "He used the word girlfriend, not partner; partner means a much closer relationship. If he had said partner or SO, I would have replied differently. The commonly accepted usage is that boyfriend is for a casual, less committed relationship whereas partner means a more serious commitment; partner as in \"life partner\".", "NTA.  You aren't accusing her of infidelity or having inappropriate feelings for her bf/ex.  You said you'd support her, but you'd be \"very uncomfortable.\"  She responded by calling you \"a crazy, insecure and jealous AH.\"\n\nYou were both honest and supportive.  What answer would have been acceptable, other than \"I <3 this idea!  Yes, you must do this!\"", "Do I agree with you on your position in the matter? No. Do I think it's a reasonable position and you well within your right to have yet? Yes. She asked for your opinion and you answered honestly. You weren't crazy, controlling, or AH. The other things are subjective stuff. NTA", "She asked for your opinon, then got mad when you gave it. You told her you support whatever she decides, and she still got upset. \n\nNTA\n\nYour gf is a bit of an AH for asking then getting mad when your opinion is not what she wanted it to be.", "She's likely looking at it as a gift she can give her best friend who is like family. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nAs an adoptive mother of kids who don't give a crap about finding their biological parents, I'd say that a real parent is the one who raises the child; not the one who provides the genetic material.", "She does love her ex. He\u2019s her best friend and they\u2019ve known each other their whole lives. But there\u2019s nothing romantic.", "There\u2019s nothing going on between them.", "Obviously they will do it officially. There are different kinds of IVF. She\u2019s not going to be the surrogate. Just the donor. They\u2019re asking people they know and love and trust because it\u2019s a difficult process not because it makes it cheaper they\u2019re spending $50k anyway. \n\nNo offense but you are a very cynical person.", "Scraping an egg out of someone is a very different procedure than jacking off into a jar and using a turkey baster. Of course they are doing it officially! \n\nGosh, you've jumped to tons of conclusions, here.", "I won\u2019t be putting any ultimatums on her body.", "She asked how he felt about it.
