Here\u2019s the thing from the friends perspective. He has someone in his life he trusts and respects who could be the reason he gets to have a baby with his wife. I mean sure they could find a donor egg (I believe\u2026) but it might mean more to both of them to know they\u2019re surrounded by people loving and supporting this next step in their life. \n\nOn the other hand. Of course hearing an ex is requesting this is going to make you feel uncomfortable. You\u2019re anticipating them bringing up the fact that it\u2019s biologically your girlfriends kid. That can make anyone uncomfortable but it doesn\u2019t make you jealous but possibly does show some insecurities that are honestly normal in this situation. You showed your support but also gave your honest opinion on it and she disrespected you. Hopefully you can return to this conversation and smooth things over.", "NTA\nbeing a person who also has a great relationship with my ex I don\u2019t think you\u2019re overreacting\u2026 It is really strange to think that her ex, who still in your guys life, will have a children with her DNA etc \nbesides of that, there\u2019s a lot of people who does that kind of donation\u2026 and may I\u2019m tripping but it should better to be someone who be related with his wife (?) \nbut in fact I think you\u2019re absolutely right to feel uncomfortable, it is really strange", "NTA, to be honest everyone else in this story seems off. I don't get how she can say you're jealous when you have no problem with being friends with someone who dated your gf dated for 11 years and they had only broke up 2 years before you started dating. Like doing that is the complete opposite of jealous, but it is a little weird for sure. Heck it'd make sense for younger sister to provide the egg, then it would be as close to both Ryan and his wife genetically as they can pretty much get.", "NTA - I\u2019m donor conceived and not a single person in this scenario is thinking about the child. I know there are going to be comments giving you shit about her bodily autonomy and saying you don\u2019t get a say, but I certainly think you are entitled to an opinion. If you have kids with this woman they will have a biological sibling out there, this decision would always be an impact on your life.", "NTA. \n\nShe asked. You answered. As a rule, by default, answering questions honestly doesn't make you a bad person. \n\nAlso: \n\nThey dated for eleven years, and now they want to have a child together. \n\nAs an internet stranger who doesn't know any of you I'm not qualified to answer this, but ask yourself: why her? Is there something more to this?", "NTA. There are other options for donors.", "NTA. Donating sperm or eggs is not to be taken lightly. This would be her kid running around out there. Are the parents planning on telling kiddo the info? How will any of you feel if kid is a spitting image of your wife?  So many questions to be considered before making this life changing decision.", "NTA. Why is she insisting so much to be their donor? It's normal to feel uncomfortable is a situation like this. Also you didn't tell her that you won't support her if she agrees to be the donor. So why did she get mad? I'd try to talk to her once more to clarify the situation and then see how she reacts.", "NTA. \nI suggest you consider ending this relationship. She's going to have an attachment to the child for sure, and you're gonna develop some resentment about the situation for sure. \n\nAnd the fact that she called you insecure to your face after asking you your opinion makes her sound like a b**ch.", "You are not crazy I would be absolutely livid and I was in your shoes and she went ahead I wouldn\u2019t even continue with the relationship. They should buy donor eggs why are they asking her, I find it highly inappropriate.", "NTA- you should also suggest to your gf that there are other concerns.   \nIf she hasn't already she should look into how donor conceived people feel. There are groups, support groups for them, information for those considering, all that.   \nI would just really encourage her to do a lot of research from the viewpoint of donor conceived people.   \nIt's also really important that Ryan and his wife are able to seek therapy to deal with the news of infertility before taking further steps towards building a family in other ways, they do not want to pass on their own trauma to a child.", "NTA. You recognize that it is ultimately her choice and said you would support her decision. She asked how you feel about the situation and you answered.", "Nta.  I would feel weird about it but honestly not your decision.", "NTA. But she already made her plan and this wasn\u2019t asking your permission. It was simply a courtesy to inform you. Now you need to decide if you want to stay with someone who insults you and disregards your feels on an issue that will indirectly affect you.", "sounds like your gf is still in love with her ex ( or she has no boundaries whatsoever) - neither reasoning hides well for your future together \n\nNTA", "NTA for being honest about your feelings, though she didn't even have to talk to you about it, you're in a new relationship and not married so she didn't really need to discuss it with you at all but chose to. Her reaction was likely because you indicated it wasn't something you would get over (\"constantly reminded\"). If you can't get past this, I suspect your relationship has a dim future.", "NTA.

One ex (they dated for a year ending almost 10 years ago) asked him 5 years ago for sperm to have a kid by herself. That was before we met but I\u2019m so glad he didn\u2019t agree because we just had our first child and seeing the kind of dad he is there\u2019s no way he could\u2019ve not been involved with that child.

But egg donation is no joke it takes a big toll on your body and might be more complex than she realizes. Egg donors (at least in my US state) have to have a psych eval before donating because it\u2019s so intense. Even for anonymous donation. This is a heavy thing to consider.", "NTA. Confused the point of different surrogate/different donor. Her younger sister isn't donating the egg for what reason?? That's as close to genetically theirs anyway.\n\nWhole situation would make me uncomfortable, too, just in how close everyone is. Ultimately, the child is biologically hers but it's not her kid. But she would 100% be very involved in the kid's life as a result of your relationship with wife and friend.", "NTA. I can sort of see both sides-she thinks she\u2019s helping a friend but, from your side, she\u2019s having her ex\u2019s baby. A pregnancy/birth is a huge commitment for yourself, it\u2019s not a normal/friendly gesture toward an ex. And I\u2019m sure they really are just friends and she\u2019s just trying to help her friend but it\u2019s ok for you to be uncomfortable with the situation.

Which means, if there's no doctors, theyre going this the old fashioned way. And you don't usually get pregnant in one go.\n\nBasically, OP, I don't think they ever really broke up.

They\u2019re very close but never cross any lines. They\u2019ve known each other for their whole lives and he doesn\u2019t have any family so she is his closest thing and I understand that he wants someone he is close to and trusts.

At least the little I know about it the surrogates a mainly just carrying the baby.", "Just ask her if she is willing to never ever think about that child being part hers.  Personally it would take alot of willpower to never ever think that is my biological child. Esp if you watch grow up or have different parenting styles.  I think it would be easier for all for a strangers eggs.  \n\nI also considered doing something for a family member than went thru what if a person died (family member) or xyz.

She didn't have to even discuss it with you, it's her body and her life. She chose to and you answered honestly. I think probably she's thinking that her choice will ruin the relationship, and she might be right since you said, \"being constantly reminded\".", "Good luck. I couldn't do it.", "That\u2019s even weirder that you\u2019re getting brought into the tail end of the discussion.  How much time has she spent talking with her ex about making a baby together?!", "Right, but that brings up a different possible struggle if suddenly that child wants a much closer relationship with OP and OP's wife.", "If it's not anger issues, then it seems like she \"asked\" for your opinion because she wanted you to agree with her and/or praise her.\n\nIf she actually wanted your opinion, then her reaction is not normal.", "No, sister\u2019s the surrogate, they want OP\u2019s gf\u2019s eggs.", "OP said sis is going to be the surrogate.", "Two years is not \"very new\", and marriage is a piece of paper. \n\nShe didn't have to discuss it - though really one can argue that we're not ever technically obligated to do anything, rendering your assertion meaningless - but hiding major life decisions like *producing a child* from your partner is generally considered poor form.", "I don\u2019t really see what difference being married makes. We\u2019re in a committed relationship regardless.", "The child would understand that OP\u2019s gf only gave their parents the biological material they needed to make them, but she is in no way their mother. This is no different from an adoption.", "Yes 2 years is very new, there are high school couples who have dated longer than that. And marriage is more than a piece of paper if it's a real marriage, it's a commitment. Being someone's GF or BF is temporary 99% of the time so I wouldn't say they are partners at all.", "True, you can be committed without marriage, I agree. It was more the \"new relationship\" part, and 2 years is very new, so in my opinion being BF and GF doesn't mean you have to ask permission or share everything, especially when only 5% of BF/GF relationships last long term.", "You're not wrong, and  agree. That's what I'm saying though, these can have hosts of issues and unintended responsibilities that OP may not want. OP's wife may or may not have fully thought them through, but given its only been a day probably is just looking at the initial implications.", "No, the child wouldn\u2019t necessarily \u201cunderstand\u201d that.

She is not \u201cin no way their mother\u201d because she would be their biological mother. It\u2019s very important that people come to terms with that.", "2 years isn\u2019t new by any stretch, unless you\u2019re a commitment phobe.", "If it's a real marriage? As opposed to a fake one? \n\nWhat delineates fake marriages from real ones, then? The emotional commitment? The same emotional commitment that humans are capable of making *without* a bit of paper and some ceremony?

Those are coin flip odds of bringing in the lawyers.", "This isn\u2019t OP\u2019s wife. She just his gf. She probably doesn\u2019t mind helping to navigate any emotional ups and downs that come from this decision because the child\u2019s father would be her best friend. She would probably be a huge part of the child\u2019s life regardless of who the egg donor is.", "I guess it depends on your perspective; lots of high schoolers date the same person for 2 years, I wouldn't call that a committed relationship either. From the perspective of being married well over 20 years, I consider 2 years a short-term relationship at best. Maybe they'll be together in 2 more years, maybe they won't'; research suggests only 5% of BF/GF situations last.", "Ture, couples can be committed without marriage, I agree. And in some states just living together long enough is considered marriage (common-law marriage).  As for studies, HER magazine referred to a peer reviewed study of 2000 men and 2000 women; the average was 19 bf/gf/dating/relationships before marriage, so I was a bit off, it's 5% of couples that end in marriage, not 1%.", "You're right, sounds like she'd be fine with it. Also my b on the GF and not wife thing.", "2 years in a HS relationship is even longer term. That\u2019s forever in a life stage where you\u2019re often infatuated with a new person every few months.", "If you insist on solely reviewing the success of relationships by legal status - I'm not sure what point your reference to common law marriage was supposed to address - I'd say you've very sorely missed the point of relationships. \n\nRelationships and experiences are not rendered less meaningful simply because they end; concurrently, a marriage is not more meaningful just because it lasts. Or just because it exists. \n\nMarriage isn't some \"win condition\" at fulfilment of which you can say that a relationship is worth something.", "But you don't expect it to last either, that's kind of my point. 2 years is way too short to know if you're going to stay with that person or not so best to be cautious about intertwining your lives too much that early. Doesn't mean you are going to leave at the drop of a hat, just that for example, you probably shouldn't give up a life changing opportunity if it meant moving away from that person.", "No, I think you missed my point, maybe I said it badly...  2 years is a very new relationship, and 95% of BF/GF relationships don't last (peer reviewed study in 2020). She was considerate to talk to him first, but not obligated to do so. Oh and the common law part was to acknowledge that even the government recognizes long term stable relationships legally. I totally agree that relationships are not less meaningful if they end 100%... I never meant to say anything otherwise.", ">Oh and the common law part was to acknowledge that even the government recognizes long term stable relationships legally.\n\nIt shouldn't. The government needs to concern itself less with what we do in our bedrooms, not more. \n\nAnd I understood your point, I just don't agree with it, to put it charitably.\n\nTwo years is not that new, and relationships statistically not lasting is not an excuse for poor treatment. \n\nNobody is really obligated to do anything. Redditors have this bizarre philosophical thrust of \"nobody is obligated to anyone\", which, while in some ontological sense being true, also makes the very concept of \"obligation\" meaningless. This sub isn't \"have I technically breached some ill-defined legal rule\", it's \"have I been a dick\". \n\nWe have established a largely unwritten code of social behaviours to live by, however, and by those standards omitting to mention major life choices from a significant other is generally considered a party foul."]}
