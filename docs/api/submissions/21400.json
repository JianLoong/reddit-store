People mess up all the time, and most of the time, it's not that big of a deal.  But pretending you didn't mess up when you did, and accusing the other person to distract from the real issue ... in my own life, that's not something that gives me confidence this is someone who would be capable of and willing to work through more important issues with me.  Not that Spiderman isn't important! :)", "NTA.  You literally had planned a date with her to go see it and she spoiled the movie for you.

I suspect the next time you argue she'll trot out another pop psych buzzword she doesn't understand, like gaslighting. No, she did something shady, and trying to turn it back on you is manipulative and a bad indicator of her character.", "I agree. My siblings wanted to go watch it. So I decided to watch the first one with my sister and enjoyed it. Sadly it was sold out in theaters when we got there, so we all watched elemental instead and had a blast. \n\nBut I absolutely try to avoid spoiling stuff for people if I can and I definitely wouldn\u2019t go with friends if I made plans to see it with my partner.

Assuming the date was known and mutual it\u2019s pretty disrespectful and inconsiderate but ofc he can\u2019t force anything and doesn\u2019t seem to", "But spoilers though?", "Of course she can do what she wants, she can cheat and insult him, or whatever.

I find it really enjoyable to do stuff TOGETHER. If we've both already seen it I think it's a waste of time and money and we'll have to wait for another opportunity", "I don't agree with that. BUT I do agree in this case, you are right since it was already planned before the fried of your gf asked. \n\nBut if it was the other way around and her friend planned a movie night with her and she would have watched it with you beforehand, I think she would have a right to be mad too. \n\nSo, I would say \"made plans before spontaneous ideas\" is a good rule to stick with. \n\nNTA.", "Depends how long you've been together. My relationships have always been a priority and my parents are definitely each others' priority. But in your situation it's more that you'd already agreed to go together.

Her action was not considerate and the opposite of thoughtful.
