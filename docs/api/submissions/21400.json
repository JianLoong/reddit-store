No, she did something shady, and trying to turn it back on you is manipulative and a bad indicator of her character.", "I agree. My siblings wanted to go watch it. So I decided to watch the first one with my sister and enjoyed it. Sadly it was sold out in theaters when we got there, so we all watched elemental instead and had a blast. \n\nBut I absolutely try to avoid spoiling stuff for people if I can and I definitely wouldn\u2019t go with friends if I made plans to see it with my partner.

Some of the takes are outrageous but it's probably people like her so they think the samw", "I'd argue outright spoiling the movie for him at least makes her TA knowing he hadn't seen it yet and was excited to.", "Have you ever heard of this thing called common sense?", "He did communicate with her that he wanted to see it with her as he scheduled a date to see it. She knew about the date ahead of time, then she calls him to spoil the movie for him?", "I\u2019m a lurker here usually but what the actual fuck is this response????", "Sounds like the gf doesnt care about him either lol", "If she wants to spend time with her friend they can watch a different movie.", "I won't downvote you for not getting it, but OP really isn't the asshole here, the girlfriend is. Maybe he thought she said it was too sudden the first time he tried to take her to the movie because she hadn't seen the first one and therefore wouldn't understand the sequel. He planned a movie night to show it to her and made reservations to have a date night to see the sequel with her because he was excited and wanted to share the experience with her. But then despite knowing OP was excited to see it *with her,* she saw the sequel with a friend instead (who had already seen it, so if they went to the movies just to hang out (as friends often do) the two of them could have and should have seen a different movie). And then the girlfriend proceeded to spoil the whole movie that OP was so excited to see with her. He introduced her to the franchise so he could share the experience with her specifically. But instead, she went with someone else and ruined his plans and his whole experience for when he does get to see the movie. \n\nHere's another example from my own life. My dad hates going to the movies because it's expensive and people tend to talk through the whole thing. He didn't go see a movie in theaters for over a decade because of this. He liked Top Gun when it came out and he enjoys Tom Cruise as a performer, so when Maverick was announced he was actually excited to go to a theater. The movie got pushed several times due to the global issue so he waited a couple *years* to see it and planned to take our family to see it. I can tell you with absolute certainty that if one of us went to that movie without him and then told him all about the new characters and the plot and spoiled the whole thing, he would never watch the movie and he'd never watch another movie with whoever spoiled it. Movies and fandoms are a serious thing for some people, and if it's not that serious for you, that's fine. But can you maybe see why OP was so upset about this now?", "Exactly, so many red flags here, run for the hills OP", "My guess is toxic.", "Yeah it's a dick move but from my quick glance I assumed she just blurted it out as opposed to OP saying no spoilers then her doing it out of malice, I just see it as the GF not understanding the importance this film had to OP. Just my 2 cents", "No. Please explain.", "Sure, if he hadn't had her watch the first with the intent to watch the second one together and then tried to make plans to see that second one together. Then I'd say she may not know the importance. But it's pretty clear here it's a movie OP was excited to see and it's basic respect to not spoil new movies to people, especially ones you know people are excited about seeing. \n\nIt was a dick move, but it was also an asshole move.", "I think clear lack of communication is what's happened here , I don't think because of this gf is an AH , but I see your point and where you are coming from. But I'm gonna stir the pot now. I think OP might be overreacting slightly and should just get over it as in the grand scheme of things this is a minor.....I await the hell \ud83d\udd25 lol", "I think a relationship should absolutely come before friends otherwise you might as well in just be in one with whomever you feel is more important than your partner."]}
