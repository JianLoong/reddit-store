Maybe he thought she said it was too sudden the first time he tried to take her to the movie because she hadn't seen the first one and therefore wouldn't understand the sequel. He planned a movie night to show it to her and made reservations to have a date night to see the sequel with her because he was excited and wanted to share the experience with her. But then despite knowing OP was excited to see it *with her,* she saw the sequel with a friend instead (who had already seen it, so if they went to the movies just to hang out (as friends often do) the two of them could have and should have seen a different movie). And then the girlfriend proceeded to spoil the whole movie that OP was so excited to see with her. He introduced her to the franchise so he could share the experience with her specifically. But instead, she went with someone else and ruined his plans and his whole experience for when he does get to see the movie. \n\nHere's another example from my own life. My dad hates going to the movies because it's expensive and people tend to talk through the whole thing. He didn't go see a movie in theaters for over a decade because of this. He liked Top Gun when it came out and he enjoys Tom Cruise as a performer, so when Maverick was announced he was actually excited to go to a theater. The movie got pushed several times due to the global issue so he waited a couple *years* to see it and planned to take our family to see it. I can tell you with absolute certainty that if one of us went to that movie without him and then told him all about the new characters and the plot and spoiled the whole thing, he would never watch the movie and he'd never watch another movie with whoever spoiled it. Movies and fandoms are a serious thing for some people, and if it's not that serious for you, that's fine.

Then I'd say she may not know the importance. But it's pretty clear here it's a movie OP was excited to see and it's basic respect to not spoil new movies to people, especially ones you know people are excited about seeing. \n\nIt was a dick move, but it was also an asshole move.", "I think clear lack of communication is what's happened here , I don't think because of this gf is an AH , but I see your point and where you are coming from. But I'm gonna stir the pot now. I think OP might be overreacting slightly and should just get over it as in the grand scheme of things this is a minor.....I await the hell \ud83d\udd25 lol", "I think a relationship should absolutely come before friends otherwise you might as well in just be in one with whomever you feel is more important than your partner.", "Your gf is a jerk. Seriously.", "You need to kick this person to the curb and find someone who gets it", "ESH. You sound like you were being really pedantic about it and that it wasn't fun to have to sit and be lectured about the differences in the movies. It wasn't fun for her to go with you. It was fun to go with her friend. You don't have to do everything together, but calling you and spoiling it for you was a dick move on her part. Dates shouldn't involve homework. Maybe you two need to let eachother have a bit of space to enjoy things separately.", "INFO: has she seen the MCU Spider-Man movies and the original Spider-Man movies? Also when you were explaining the differences between the animated one and the others, was this while you were watching the movie?", "People are so dramatic. Did you specifically TELL HER and communicate how extremely important it was to you that you guys saw it together? Or did you just say oh hey we should go to the movies and see it. Because if you didn\u2019t express how much it meant to you for it to be seen together, it\u2019s unfair for you to hold that against her.

I'm a spidey fan girl and I made plans to see it with my bestie, and if he saw it without me I'd probably cry lol.\n\nSpoilers were uncalled for.

I think you made it clear how much the movie/franchise meant to you. She knew this and not only went and saw the movie, but then decided to give you spoilers. \n\nSidenote: It was an awesome movie. Definitely recommend and I plan to go see it again.", "Well don\u2019t make plans with her. Enjoy the movie with a friend even though she spoiled it. Red flags", "Her flipping the blame in the situation (DARVO to label the term for clarification) set off buzzers in my head too. I\u2019ve dealt with people who do that in mild ways and people who are extreme in how they do it. Whether they do it in big or small ways, it can seriously mess with your head. In my last serious relationship, my ex pretty would do it so aggressively that I felt like I was going crazy, unable to trust myself, my memories, my perception of reality. I began feeling like an asshole in advance if something upset me because I knew that if I brought it up, it would be flipped on me, so I started to even doubt my perception of reality in those moments. Honestly, I began writing things down that he would say and do with the dates and approximate time range. That way I could at least be able to look back and know whether I remembered something correctly.\n\nThe situation with my ex was pretty extreme, I had to get a protective order to get away, so I don\u2019t want to project all of that on to OP\u2019s situation. I did want to mention it though because I can see small similarities popping up. OP is in a pretty clear cut, NTA situation, but the fact that he\u2019s questioning it and worried enough to need outside opinions, especially ones that aren\u2019t from friends, is concerning. Sure, it\u2019s not likely she\u2019s this massively abusive person, but she\u2019s definitely being manipulative and it is messing with OP\u2019s head. Like I said, it doesn\u2019t matter if the manipulative actions are big or small, they still fuck with your head and it can have long term effects.", "She turned him down.

Is she somewhat childish and she doesn't have the best communication skills, so she does stuff like lashing out to \"punish\" you for things? Like, did you ruin something of hers, so she tried to get you back? Is she trying to hoard experiences as just-hers at first for some reason, and only willing to have you join after? Does she resent the way you do stuff and she wanted to muck it up?\n\n2) her starting to find you annoying/ unattractive and putting in distance, as she favors other's company. Like, she wanted to see it, but she didn't want to see it *with you* and so she pretended she \"forgot\" and went with a friend. Or, is she a pushover who went along with a pushy friend for the nth time because she prioritizes others over you?\n\n3) she is picking a fight because she wants to break up\n\nI feel like her just forgetting is not a viable reason unless she turns out to have a brain tumor or something. She was informed of the plan and agreed to it, so there is no space for her to feign ignorance.\n\nI'm thinking your girlfriend liked the movie, but did not like experiencing it with you.\n\nShe may not enjoy the formality of your approach, with all the explanations, back story, homework, and comparisons with the other spiderman. She might just want to watch the movie. You come with a full weight of long term fan boy. \n\nShe still did something shitty, though.\n\nI'd just ask her \"why did you go see this when you know we had plans to see it in __days? And why did you spoil it for me, when you knew I was excited?\" She'll probably get defensive, though, so fight through the DARVO until you figure it out.", "I can\u2019t see this situation playing out without her having done it to intentionally spite you. NTA but you should think about her actions and consider if there is any kind of pattern here. She also pulled that gatekeeping bullshit from a friend or something to excuse herself for being a dick. You were literally doing the opposite of gatekeeping by encouraging her to get into it.", "NTA. I'm not being overly dramatic when I say she is a line-stepper and you need to dump her immediately, leave her a bad Google review and  unfollow her socials.... the AUDACITY... sharing your hobbies/interests/geekdom with someone you care about is a sacred bond and for them to betray that trust is unacceptable.\n\nAlso, going to a movie and then inviting your friend to go see it the SAME day? Women don't do that... guys do that. More importantly, SINGLE guys do that... she was with a dude.\n\nShe's for the streets!", "NTA and that truly sucks. A movie you were looking forward too has been forever tainted because she spoiled it.", "NTA - She was the asshole since the spoilers...", "NTA, it\u2019s pretty clear she doesn\u2019t give af. She also really tried to gaslight you that you were \u201cgatekeeping\u201d spiderman lol. You set up a date that she agrees too. She goes ahead and does the date activity but without you, then spoils the movie, and then attempts to gaslight you that you\u2019re the problem. YWNBTA if you took a friend to the movie instead.", "Flag called on the play.", "Thanks for the heads up I will consider it", "Ask her. She went to the movies and saw the movie he really wanted to see, then called him and ruined it, on purpose.", "How exactly is that funny?", "Aw man. I struggled to enjoy it honestly because of the spoilers. I just wonder what it would've been like", "Yeah the friend really loved it and immediately wanted to take her apparently. Some people even said she was w another guy \ud83d\ude02", "He said he did and that she knew that they planned to see that movie", "And honestly, to some extent, seeing the movie before OP isnt a huge deal\u2026 so long as she doesn\u2019t say she did, let alone tell spoilers. I can only imagine how many couples watch a show together but one secretly watches ahead when they\u2019re alone.", "I don't understand why people don't let others experience things for the first time. It's not that complicated to keep you mouth shut for a few days :')", "I'm so sorry dude. People will say we are exaggerating but if it was the fifa cup they wouldn't say a damn thing. \n\nMy take on this? You have enough time to find someone else who wants to enjoy things with you like you do with them. If you wanna stay that's your choice, but I imagine this isn't the first time she's pushed you aside and minimized your feelings. That's disrespectful and no one has to deal with that, much less from a partner.", "If I have to sit through someone explaining everything to me like I'm a child, I wouldn't want to see the movie with them, either. It's Spiderman, not calculus. If OP makes it a chore, his GF will choose to not participate. If this is enough to break up over, then definitely do so.", "Then she's entirely at fault.  She was going to be an AH either way.  The only question was whether he did anything wrong as well.  \n\nAnd it appears he didn't.", "Yeah that\u2019s a bit of a dick move", "Well I guess you can't read", "Gaslighting.  Over\u2026seeing a movie.\n\nHilarious.  Silly silly goose.", "Lots of bots today!", "This isn't just about that though, it's basic etiquette.  You could be her \\*other\\* bff and you'd have the same grievance.\n\nShe's either very callous or easy to manipulate and does whatever her bff says she should do.\n\nAt a minimum she could have called you to ask how you'd feel since you had plans to see it with her.", "It\u2019s literally a movie. He doesn\u2019t have to see it with her if he doesn\u2019t want but that doesn\u2019t prevent her from seeing it", "Seeing something with someone for the first time is much different than it being a repeat for them.  I am sorry you can't see that.", "Run!", "Grow TF UP! It's a comic book movie. You probably have your whole home decorated with Spidey as well, right? It's a stupid movie. She saw it. Big deal. Save the money you would have spent on her ticket, go alone and buy an extra big popcorn.", "Didn't read. But naita. How can she go to the movies without your permission?", "Yta just because y\u2019all comic fans are f\u2019ing insufferable \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. \n\nProbably didn\u2019t want to go see it with you because she didn\u2019t feel like having to sit through ten thousand explanations of why it isn\u2019t like the comics and all the backstory y\u2019all like to give to us who aren\u2019t real fans. \n\nIf she wanted a Ted talk about the movie she\u2019d go to one. \n\nNothing is worse than watching DC AND Marvel movies with comic book fans lol.", "YTA. Grow up, dork.", "Doesn't seem like she's being very nice to you. Spoilers are so rude.", "NTA. It sounds like your girlfriend is more into this guy \u201cfriend. \u201c It\u2019s not that they cannot be just friends, but it sounds like she jumped at the chance to hang out.  It may be best to move on to someone who values your time and effort", "You are absolutely NTA right off the bat. Especially because you had preplanned to see it with her AND she didn't hide spoilers. That would make me angry too. \n\n\nBut to be a little more productive than just assigning blame; Have you considered that giving her the breakdown of the movie afterwards and stuff may have ruined it a bit for her? \nI like Spiderman, I watched the original and No Way Home and enjoyed them. However, my partner wanted to see the new one with me and I said no.\n\n Why? Because he gets REEAAAALLLY into it, and listening to 45mins of him explaining alternate universes and arguing with me over who MY favorite version of it is got extremely frustrating. I'd say \"I liked the original spiderman the best. I feel like they made his character more human. But NWH had waaayy better villians and a more comedic storyline which I really enjoyed.\" And then he'd go off on a tangent about how NWH has an advantage and Doc Oc was actually a fairly good villan for reasons xyz and etc. Or, insteas of arguing, he'd dominate the conversation on it so that my opinion about what we just watched together didn't matter. I'd say I thought something was cool or sad and he'd have 20 minutes worth of information about that exact thing he felt he needed to share. All while I sat silently trying not to zone out. \n\nI just wanted to enjoy the movie, not have someone explain what I just watched to me immediately afterwards. I didn't want a 10 minute rundown of all the different shows/movies/comic books of Spiderman and which ones are or aren't related. I just. Wanted. To. Watch. The. Movie. \nObviously there are times when I'm all in for him to nerd out and I do my best to pay attention and really engage, but this was not one of them.\n\nI think the difference is that I felt comfortable enough to straight up tell him that I loved him, but he was boring the heck outta me and I don't enjoy having movies/shows *explained* to me, and he was mature enough to take it and move on(After \"one last thing\" of course \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02). I don't know if that's how your conversations went or how long you even talked about the movie after it was over. But it's worth considering this aspect and maybe doing a check in about yall's communication skills.", "The fact she tried turning it around - dump her. If she had acted differently about it then ok. But she seems very immature and possibly manipulative.", "NTA. She sounds majorly immature.", "NTA - media \"cheating\" in a relationship is a thing and it's rude as hell", "NTA\nNot to be that guy, but it\u2019s Spider-Man not Spiderman", "NTA. You don't have to date people you don't like, or who treat you this badly.", "ESH. You are being really weird about, of all things, a movie. And she knew you wanted to experience it with her and obviously hurt you. But still ESH", "NTA\n\nAnd I can't get over the spoilers thing. Like... seriously? You JUST introduced her to this, you were excited about the new movie and not only did she ditch you to see it with a friend, she goes ahead and spoils the entire thing for you?

Are you 13 years old or 14 years old?", "Obviously she did", ">You are not gatekeeping. \n\nThat stuck out to me as well\n\nGatekeeping is keeping someone *out* of a community/fandom - if OP was gatekeeping he'd have tried intentionally to decimate her interest through a range of shit tests, making it \"boring\", or making it completely impossible to penetrate (Marvel may have actually painted themselves into a corner by having such a complex, long, extended universe...they've got a core die hard base sure, but surrounding that base is a group who aren't following and are just picking out 1 or 2 bangers that catch their eye because marvel is known for light hearted popcorn flicks and solid action - if they produce enough duds this portion will stop bothering, but then you have everyone else that wasn't in at the ground floor - who definitely aren't going to be like \"oh endgame sure looks cool...guess I need to watch the 20 films that are prerequisite to endgame actually being good and understandable huh?\" - at a certain point you will kill any chance of new fans joining due to the time sink - 2 hours every half year at a cinema is 100% doable, 26 2 hour films in 2 weeks before the new one drops is only enjoyable if you're already a fan)", "Exactly", "Oof someone has never made plans with a partner only for them to wreck those plans without even a notice", ">Grow up, dork.\n\nSpeaking as a heterosexual woman men who let that inner goofy child who enjoys \"dorky\"/\"childish\" things out every once in a while are infinitely more attractive than men who think that once they turn 18 their life should be all serious and mature and manly and adult all the time, and it's not even a contest. \n\n\"All work no play\" isn't a personality it's a diagnosis.", "He's not\n\nLike seriously it was a lad with a really sweet and unique date experience planned out -dinner followed by seeing a movie with his significant other, that he'd just introduced that movie world to.\n\nIt's not controlling or weird to like having \"your thing\" with your SO, something just the 2 of you do together that's a clothed, non sexual activity, is really sweet and a great way to bond. \n\nIs she her own woman who can watch the spiderman sequal whenever she pleases, with who she pleases? YES. *However* in a relationship when someone brings you into their world (note the gender neutrality here this goes both ways) and tries to introduce you into \"common interests\" you might share, a little bit of common sense regarding \"they want this to be *our* thing\" goes a long way.\n\nMe and my ex used to do our pub quiz together at a local alternative rock pub - so the questions were random and funny. Me and him could've gone with anyone else, I could've gone with my friends, he could've gone with his, but we both had the knowledge that doing that pub quiz together was one of our first dates, so unofficially it was sort of \"our thing\" and bringing anyone else in crossed an unspoken line, none of us would've said anything or broken up over it but suddenly this very special thing between us would've been \"tainted\"", "\ud83d\ude2d", "Clearly", "More like someone who doesn\u2019t let their relationship revolve around superficial bullshit like superhero movies, dork.", ">I can only imagine how many couples watch a show together but one secretly watches ahead when they\u2019re alone.\n\nFor anyone considering doing this word of advice - don't.

Obviously her friend ranks above you", "Healthy relationships aren\u2019t built around demanding that your partner share your every interest. There is nothing wrong with liking superhero movies. It is in fact dysfunctional and wildly immature to suggest that someone isn\u2019t a good partner because they saw a movie without you. People are advising OP to immediately dump their partner here. They are dorks. A simple conversation and adjustment of expectations is perfectly sufficient.", "That may be true however she has shown her true self.

It's common courtesy to at least tell him that she is changing the plans", "Right, and it\u2019s common courtesy to share his feelings about the issue, accept that this isn\u2019t a shared interest, and move on. Instead, OP took the issue to the internet to feel better about himself. Which makes him an asshole.\n\nShe said she would still go see it with him. Holy shit it\u2019s not that big of a deal.

She\u2019s either super oblivious or so selfish that she would 1) crap on your plans to experience the new movie together and 2) ruin the movie for you by dropping a bunch of spoilers when she knew how much you were looking forward to the movie. The fact that she turned you being upset into an opportunity to play the victim points to the latter. It says a lot that she\u2019s willing to screw up your plans over a random invite from a friend who\u2019d already seen the movie.

I stopped watching the shows we would start together becaue they would do this. In the end they would get more upset though because 9/10 I had zero or little interest in the show to begin with and I only watched it because they wanted to together.", "That's not a hard and fast rule -- it depends on context.  \n\nBut, in this particular case, you are NTA.  The important part here is, you made plans with her -- or you clearly tried to do so.  You tried to make plans for a whole date, that included the movie.\n\nAgreeing to plans with your partner DOES come before plans of the same level with friends.  Or should!\n\n(I mean -- a very good friend having a genuine emergency is something that could reasonably cause you to postpone plans you'd made with your partner.  But this isn't in that category at ALL.)\n\nLike others here, I don't like that she's immediately making it your fault and that you're treating her badly (or possessively).  That is not a good look for her.\n\nOne thing I might suggest: step back from this exact situation a bit, and think about the underlying reasons you're upset.  Then see if you can have a talk with her, where you are able to talk about that.  Because that's what's really going on here.\n\nIt sounds like you're upset because you had some expectations, based on actions you took.  Your actions were: making sure she saw the 1st movie, suggesting the plan of the date (dinner plus movie).  \n\nWhat's upsetting, maybe, is that she didn't get the same impression.  She doesn't realize how important this was to you, or why.  You're upset because she treated your suggestion and plans, your actions, as unimportant.  Remove the movie entirely from the situation, and this would STILL be something worth being kind of upset about. (For example: you suggested going on a date to get something to eat at a new place; she says no to that day, and winds up hanging out with her friend, and going with the friend to the same place.)\n\nPerhaps you did this originally, but -- this COULD partly be a communication thing.  You would think that after all these actions on your part -- making sure she saw the 1st movie, you being excited to see the new one, suggesting the date to see it together -- that she would realize, \"I want to share the experience of seeing it for the first time with you\".  But did you say that in so many words?   I do think many people would realize that from you going to these efforts, but it sure sounds like she did not.  So you know for the future (if there is one!) to be more explicit about what you want, and what's important to you. (Doing this thing together, for the first time for both of you, like seeing a new movie.)\n\nI'm not saying that to suggest that you're in the wrong!  You're not.  I just know that often, we fail to realize that other people don't know what's most important to us about something.  We think it's obvious, but for some people, it's not.  And that's when you have to learn to state the obvious (even though that feels like it shouldn't be necessary).  It's a good thing to keep in mind, is all.", "Seriously. Gatekeeping pop culture is so annoying and it sucks the joy out of experiences for other people.  OP will either learn that or not, but that's up to him.", "You don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m pointing out which person is an asshole?", "No assholes here in my opinion. You shared something that you loved and she came to love it too. Maybe it didn\u2019t work out like you planned , but c\u2019est la vie!

I think it's pretty obvious between bf/gf that if they agree to see a new movie together, that they'll go together. Not ruin it beforehand (and then share spoilers). Thinking this is a communication problem is, IMO, giving OP's gf a lot of benefit of the doubt.  \n\nBut either way, your advice is the best course of action for OP. Focus on communicating clearly what OP knows for sure: his feelings about what happened. OP shouldn't try to read his GF's mind on this.\n\n(NTA)"]}
