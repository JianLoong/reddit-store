Maybe he thought she said it was too sudden the first time he tried to take her to the movie because she hadn't seen the first one and therefore wouldn't understand the sequel. He planned a movie night to show it to her and made reservations to have a date night to see the sequel with her because he was excited and wanted to share the experience with her. But then despite knowing OP was excited to see it *with her,* she saw the sequel with a friend instead (who had already seen it, so if they went to the movies just to hang out (as friends often do) the two of them could have and should have seen a different movie). And then the girlfriend proceeded to spoil the whole movie that OP was so excited to see with her. He introduced her to the franchise so he could share the experience with her specifically. But instead, she went with someone else and ruined his plans and his whole experience for when he does get to see the movie. \n\nHere's another example from my own life. My dad hates going to the movies because it's expensive and people tend to talk through the whole thing. He didn't go see a movie in theaters for over a decade because of this. He liked Top Gun when it came out and he enjoys Tom Cruise as a performer, so when Maverick was announced he was actually excited to go to a theater. The movie got pushed several times due to the global issue so he waited a couple *years* to see it and planned to take our family to see it. I can tell you with absolute certainty that if one of us went to that movie without him and then told him all about the new characters and the plot and spoiled the whole thing, he would never watch the movie and he'd never watch another movie with whoever spoiled it. Movies and fandoms are a serious thing for some people, and if it's not that serious for you, that's fine. But can you maybe see why OP was so upset about this now?", "Exactly, so many red flags here, run for the hills OP", "My guess is toxic.", "Yeah it's a dick move but from my quick glance I assumed she just blurted it out as opposed to OP saying no spoilers then her doing it out of malice, I just see it as the GF not understanding the importance this film had to OP. Just my 2 cents", "No. Please explain.", "Sure, if he hadn't had her watch the first with the intent to watch the second one together and then tried to make plans to see that second one together. Then I'd say she may not know the importance. But it's pretty clear here it's a movie OP was excited to see and it's basic respect to not spoil new movies to people, especially ones you know people are excited about seeing. \n\nIt was a dick move, but it was also an asshole move.", "I think clear lack of communication is what's happened here , I don't think because of this gf is an AH , but I see your point and where you are coming from. But I'm gonna stir the pot now. I think OP might be overreacting slightly and should just get over it as in the grand scheme of things this is a minor.....I await the hell \ud83d\udd25 lol", "I think a relationship should absolutely come before friends otherwise you might as well in just be in one with whomever you feel is more important than your partner.", "Your gf is a jerk. Seriously.", "You need to kick this person to the curb and find someone who gets it", "ESH. You sound like you were being really pedantic about it and that it wasn't fun to have to sit and be lectured about the differences in the movies. It wasn't fun for her to go with you. It was fun to go with her friend. You don't have to do everything together, but calling you and spoiling it for you was a dick move on her part. Dates shouldn't involve homework. Maybe you two need to let eachother have a bit of space to enjoy things separately.", "INFO: has she seen the MCU Spider-Man movies and the original Spider-Man movies? Also when you were explaining the differences between the animated one and the others, was this while you were watching the movie?", "People are so dramatic. Did you specifically TELL HER and communicate how extremely important it was to you that you guys saw it together? Or did you just say oh hey we should go to the movies and see it. Because if you didn\u2019t express how much it meant to you for it to be seen together, it\u2019s unfair for you to hold that against her.

I'm a spidey fan girl and I made plans to see it with my bestie, and if he saw it without me I'd probably cry lol.\n\nSpoilers were uncalled for.

I think you made it clear how much the movie/franchise meant to you. She knew this and not only went and saw the movie, but then decided to give you spoilers. \n\nSidenote: It was an awesome movie. Definitely recommend and I plan to go see it again.", "Well don\u2019t make plans with her. Enjoy the movie with a friend even though she spoiled it. Red flags", "Her flipping the blame in the situation (DARVO to label the term for clarification) set off buzzers in my head too. I\u2019ve dealt with people who do that in mild ways and people who are extreme in how they do it. Whether they do it in big or small ways, it can seriously mess with your head. In my last serious relationship, my ex pretty would do it so aggressively that I felt like I was going crazy, unable to trust myself, my memories, my perception of reality. I began feeling like an asshole in advance if something upset me because I knew that if I brought it up, it would be flipped on me, so I started to even doubt my perception of reality in those moments. Honestly, I began writing things down that he would say and do with the dates and approximate time range. That way I could at least be able to look back and know whether I remembered something correctly.\n\nThe situation with my ex was pretty extreme, I had to get a protective order to get away, so I don\u2019t want to project all of that on to OP\u2019s situation. I did want to mention it though because I can see small similarities popping up. OP is in a pretty clear cut, NTA situation, but the fact that he\u2019s questioning it and worried enough to need outside opinions, especially ones that aren\u2019t from friends, is concerning. Sure, it\u2019s not likely she\u2019s this massively abusive person, but she\u2019s definitely being manipulative and it is messing with OP\u2019s head. Like I said, it doesn\u2019t matter if the manipulative actions are big or small, they still fuck with your head and it can have long term effects.", "She turned him down.
