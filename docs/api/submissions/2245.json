Your boyfriend showed you what his priorities are. They are having a good time and hanging out with his friends. You and your feelings are not a priority to him.

It would seem very rushed to theow away a lomg term relationship with someone you love just because they were selfish on your birthday. If your bf behaves this regularly however, you really should consider to leave him though. I can't judge the guy just by this behaviour alone, but what he did on your birthday isn't really a good advertisement for a long term partner. Think about how much you are worth to yourself and if your mental state allows you to stay with this person or if he has otver qualities that balance out his, hopefully, occasionally selfishness.\nYou will be in no way an AH for bringing this up though. He knew what your expectations were and they weren't really that high and his behaviour was extremely selfish.\nIf money was tight, why would he take you to a super expensive place anyways?", "OP, this is when you break up.
