You have the right to decide what to do with your own belongings, regardless of who bought them. Donating clothes to charity is a generous and kind gesture that can help those in need. You had already made your decision and communicated it to your father multiple times, and it's not fair for him to suddenly become upset and distant because he doesn't agree with your choice. It's understandable that he may feel frustrated that his money went to waste, but ultimately it's your decision what to do with the clothes.", "NTA. You know your wardrobe best. Get rid of the clutter.", "NTA. You had already considered Dad's ideas and rejected them. He is probably looking at three large trash bags of $$$ walking out the door and it probably makes him feel a bit queasy. You did your best to prepare him. Your only mistake, if you can even call it that, was allowing the sheer volume of the purge to be obvious.", "NTA - my 18yo regularly donates clothing she doesn\u2019t wear anymore. Most of it I purchased. \n\nI don\u2019t want her to have attachments to all of these items for no reason and hang on to them for a ridiculous length of time. If they aren\u2019t functional, and they are taking up valuable space in her room, I have no issues with her donating them. \nOnce I give something to her, it\u2019s hers to do with as she pleases. \n\nIf she sold it online, I wouldn\u2019t have expected any of the money she made. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your dad seems upset about it. If you do it again, maybe ask them for a receipt for the donation and give it to your father. He can use that when he files his taxes", "NTA- My dad would be on board with the rag idea as well, and while I can't say anything about Zara, as a former H&M employee it's better advised to donate them anyway. They are not worth salvaging at all, it's why they have the recycling program, but frankly it's not worth 15% off for each bag if their in garbage bags, more effective when you do it in small bin bags. Anyway, the reason it's recycled is because it's outdone it's purpose, but if the garment is of atrocious quality it's not even worth recycling. It'll just go in the trash anyhow.", "NTA. They\u2019ve been under your bed for a year. Your dad should mind his own business.", "YTA\u2014 I understand he\u2019s angry that the money he spent on your clothes is gone. Frankly, you made a mistake buying all these clothes you don\u2019t like.  I think you should examine why you bought stuff you didn\u2019t like\u2014 were you pressured? Too impulsive? Being too picky now? \n\nHe knows better than you do what that money meant\u2014 how many hours working, how difficult the work is. \n\nBut I also appreciate how bad some of this fast fashion clothing is and how it falls apart, and how these fashions change so that what was fine last year might get you picked on this year. \n\nBut what clinches for me that you\u2019re in the wrong is not that you made a mistake pretty much every girl makes, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth your time to sell them. \u201c3 bags of clothes\u2014 medium\u2014 Zara and H&M, 5 sweaters, 4 dresses etc\u201d goes up on my Facebook auctions all the time. People even pick up. You\u2019re not working but you\u2019re too busy to do that? \n\nAnd it\u2019s not kinder to poor people to give it to the charity shop, at least in my city\u2014 they are for profit and they will sell these items for more than half what you paid. A poor person buying these bags from you for $20 will save a lot compared to buying them at Value Village.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And they're just going keep piling up. There are people out there who could really use them. There's nothing wrong with donating them to those people.
