And good for you for showing what a bargain you were, at a much lesser price than a kennel. NTA\n\nOh, and *next* time, your mom can take care of your sisters dog.", "You agreed to one week.  She was gone for eight weeks.\n\nSo she expected you to do 700% more work for free?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your sister is however. Who, in their right mind, thinks it's okay to add almost two months on to a favor without asking.", "I\u2019ll also add, as a dog care professional - someone who can afford to casually extend a vacation by 7 weeks on a whim can afford whatever you asked for to take care of her dog.", "NTA. A seven week extension? Seriously? Not a big deal? Seriously? And she's furious with you? Seriously? I hope she realises how nice you're being about this.", "NTA. Turning a week of watching a dog into 8 weeks is total fucking asshole behavior. She was inconsiderate and needs to pay for it.", "NTA. From 1 week to 8 weeks gone. She better believe that she owes you money for watching her dog! She's lucky that she got off paying you a relatively low fee. Your time is valuable. Even if you aren't doing anything else, taking care of her dog for that long without paying is seriously taking advantage of you.", "She's lucky you didn't put her dog in a kennel after the week you agreed to. Tell your mom, if it ever happens again, you will drop the dog off with her since it's no big deal to watch a dog for seven weeks longer than you agreed.", "NTA\n\nDid your sister at least get her \"man?/s", "NTA\n\nIf she had known, \"she would have left him at the kennel\"? So if \"I had known I had to pay someone to care for my pet, instead of a place my pet knows and loves, I would have left it with strangers who don't care and would have done the minimum to make sure they survived....And then paid them whatever they asked, but don't want to pay you.\"\n\nNot only are you NTA, but your sister is a human who can't be trusted for anything, much less the safety of that dog.", "NTA - she was being incredibly careless with your time, and also I can\u2019t even fathom boarding a dog for 8 weeks so I hope she wasn\u2019t serious about that. That can fuck a dog up and give them\nAbandomment issues", "NTA-she changed things up on you without asking. That's a long time.", "NTA there is a huge difference between agreeing to pet sit for free for a week versus TWO MONTHS\u2026seriously how entitled and selfish is she to be upset with you over something like that? Nonsense", "NTA. The agreed upon time is free if you both agreed to it being free. She ditched her dog for two months. Not only is that completely uncool and irresponsible, but it\u2019s also a heavy burden on you that you did not agree to. Not to mention what a dog goes through when their owner suddenly disappears from their life\n\nWhen you have a dog, you have responsibilities. You don\u2019t just get to disappear whenever you feel like it. \n\nYour mom is enabling her selfish, irresponsible behavior, and that\u2019s only going to hurt your sister in the long run, when she feels like she can get away with whatever she damn well pleases. Acting like this isn\u2019t always going to get her a pat on the head. Someday she\u2019s going to have to deal with real life consequences. \n\nShe should thank you for not rehoming the dog after she disappeared for months. Legally, most courts wouldn\u2019t have allowed her to have the dog back if you chose to keep him. It\u2019s considered abandonment somewhere between four and fourteen days after the agreed upon time.", "NTA But did she at least provide you with the food for the extra time? Or were you supposed to spend your money on that?", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve never boarded a pet for anywhere near this long so someone can correct me if I\u2019m wrong: if sis did this at a boarding facility, would she be at risk of her dog being relinquished for abandonment?", "NTA\n\nYou are generous to watch the dog during eigth weeks instead of a single week.\n\nGive dad a heads up and let your sister grumpeling.\n\nNext time tell here the price before she leaves and ask for a handsout of 50 %.", "NTA", "Info: did she call you early on and say \u201cBTW, I\u2019ll be gone 2 months now instead of a week. Thanks for watching my pup this long, byyyyee\u201d and not give you any chance to refuse or talk about it, or just keep postponing?\n\n In either case you are NTA but I\u2019m struggling to understand just how self entitled she could be.", "NTA. A 7 week extension is ridiculous. I would be falling over myself apologizing if I inconvenienced anyone that way, even if they were family. Even if my dog was the most adorable dog on earth.   \n\n\nThe only thing I'd have suggested doing differently would've been contacting her to let her know you were going to begin charging her for the service. Inconsiderate as she was being, valid as you were to charge, giving her a heads up would've allowed her to make an informed decision whether or not she was going to let the dog stay there and pay you the fee take look after it, or move it to a different location (friend, cheaper sitter, etc) to save herself some money. She might have been under the mistaken impression that you love looking after her dog so much you wouldn't mind keeping it indefinitely, and this legitimately shocked her. Better communication on both ends might have stopped the situation from spiraling out of control like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You agreed to 1 week, not 8.", "NTA! Your sister is for sure. 8 weeks is entirely different from one! I dogsit a lot and am actually dogsitting for my sister right now- it depends on the dog but taking care of one for even a few days can add a lot of time/responsibility for you (with taking them out, feeding, potential medications, etc.).\n\nIt is pretty unreasonable to think she could just throw that on you with barely any warning and you wouldn't expect payment. Did you have to buy more supplies for the dog as well? Because she should be reimbursing you for that on top of paying you.", "NTA. That sounds totally fair - I would have paid you full price.", "NTA\n\nShe was gone for two MONTHS and assumed you would do it for free?  Taking care of a pet is a lot of work, especially a dog that needs to be walked a few times a day.  Your dad is right and feel free to ignore your mom.", "Write up a standard contract that includes extra payments for late pick up. Check with a local day care center for the wording.  This could be a lucrative side hustle. Being cared for by a dog or house sitter is really better for the dog than a kennel and usually much cheaper.", "NTA. She literally dumped her dog on you for 8 weeks? Tell her it would have cost a LOT more at the kennel then you charged. She'd had paid a LOT more to the kennel. It sounds like you may have undercharged her Tbh.\n\nThink twice before doing any more favors for her though If that's how she chooses to treat you.", "ESH, her more so than you. She should have asked if it was ok to extend the vacation. You for not telling her your payment expectations earlier.", "Not only does it suck for OP, it sucks for the dog too. \n\nThe fact that she can randomly take 8 week vacations with some guy she just met might be a clue to her personality, too.", "I'm not familiar with kennels. Do they take payment for time up front? I wouldn't be very surprised if she pulled this stunt on a kennel, that her pup would get a new home.", "I\u2019m sure mom is totally onboard for walking the dog, cleaning up after the dog and getting up at 2 am when the dog wants to pee", "Not only someone counting on someone's good nature but someone with plenty of money because how the hell does someone who needs to work do that", "Exactly! Most people are not in any position to randomly extend a vacation by 7 weeks w no notice! I'm assuming the sister has no job? Or is supported by someone or independently wealthy? And in that case, can afford whatever it costs to take care of her dog. \n\nHonestly I don't know if a boarding place would even accept a last minute 7 week extension! They might be booked with other pets. Or if the did have openings, you better believe you'll be charged a massive premium for that. Or individual pet sitters would most certainly be booked with other clients after that initial agreed upon 1st week. Legally, that might constitute abandonment, and the dog could have ended up in a shelter, or worse! \n\nTo dump that poor dog on someone for that length of time on anyone in any capacity shows their true nature of a self-absorbed egotist who thinks of no one besides themselves.  I'm assuming food, etc. provisions needed to be made for those 7 extra weeks, plus the inconvenience of the OP for basically tying herself down in having this extra responsibility she never agreed to. \n\nNext time your sister wants to hand the dog off to you, tell her NO THANKS! Pup can go to one of the family members who thought it was no big deal, or she can board it and reap the consequences if she pulls this stunt again! Uggh! Sorry you had to deal with that, but thanks for at least providing a stable temporary environment for the poor doggo!!", "And kennels likely would not have flexibility for her to change her plans. They book up fast.", "Right?  If she really loved her dog, she would be on her knees groveling in gratitude to her sister and in apologies to her doggy that didn't know where its person had gone off to!", "Key question right there.", "Possibly, especially because the facility likely has reservations for other customers that they now have to cancel.", "Depends on the place. The one I use is quite cheap, but uses a credit card hold for payment same as hotels for humans and charges double if you're late without calling ahead. I believe there's a time threshold for how long without a response they'll go before they surrender your dog, but it hasn't come up after signing the initial paperwork because, you know, I'm a responsible dog owner (I like to think)."]}
