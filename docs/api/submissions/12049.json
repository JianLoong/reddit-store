I dogsit a lot and am actually dogsitting for my sister right now- it depends on the dog but taking care of one for even a few days can add a lot of time/responsibility for you (with taking them out, feeding, potential medications, etc.).\n\nIt is pretty unreasonable to think she could just throw that on you with barely any warning and you wouldn't expect payment.

Most people are not in any position to randomly extend a vacation by 7 weeks w no notice! I'm assuming the sister has no job? Or is supported by someone or independently wealthy? And in that case, can afford whatever it costs to take care of her dog. \n\nHonestly I don't know if a boarding place would even accept a last minute 7 week extension! They might be booked with other pets. Or if the did have openings, you better believe you'll be charged a massive premium for that. Or individual pet sitters would most certainly be booked with other clients after that initial agreed upon 1st week. Legally, that might constitute abandonment, and the dog could have ended up in a shelter, or worse! \n\nTo dump that poor dog on someone for that length of time on anyone in any capacity shows their true nature of a self-absorbed egotist who thinks of no one besides themselves.  I'm assuming food, etc. provisions needed to be made for those 7 extra weeks, plus the inconvenience of the OP for basically tying herself down in having this extra responsibility she never agreed to. \n\nNext time your sister wants to hand the dog off to you, tell her NO THANKS! Pup can go to one of the family members who thought it was no big deal, or she can board it and reap the consequences if she pulls this stunt again! Uggh!

The one I use is quite cheap, but uses a credit card hold for payment same as hotels for humans and charges double if you're late without calling ahead. I believe there's a time threshold for how long without a response they'll go before they surrender your dog, but it hasn't come up after signing the initial paperwork because, you know, I'm a responsible dog owner (I like to think).", "ESH.\n\nI own a kennel.
