{"id": 11552, "submission_id": "11iycml", "title": "AITA for leaving my friend behind for this weekend trip?", "selftext": "I set up a weekend trip to a ski resort 2 hours away and initially invited my friend who skis to come along. For the past two months or so I've been absolutely swamped by work (big 4 audit busy season) and barely got any chances to go snowboarding as a result, even though it's an activity I really enjoy, so I really needed this. Ideally I wanted a full day of snowboarding/skiing for yesterday, stay overnight, and then get a half day in today before going back home.\n\nI had made it clear several times that I wanted her to be ready to go for 8am sharp yesterday. So I arrive at her house to pick her up just before 8. Text her that I'm there, no response. Then I send another text saying that if she's not out by 8:15, I'm leaving without her. 15 minutes go by, no response. So I frustratedly honour my promise and leave without her. She then calls me about a half hour later while I'm driving. She sounded on the verge of tears saying she slept through her alarm, and asked me to come back and pick her up. I say no and keep going. I left her behind for the trip.\n\nThe crazy thing is, I absolutely would've given her the benefit of the doubt if this was just a one-off incident. But it wasn't it's a trend with her. She's actually my ex as well, and while we dated she was constantly late for everything. And she'd always have an excuse, usually something to do with her parents wanting her to do something (and that's another thing, she still lives with her parents who treat her like a child despite the fact that she's now 25, and she seems perfectly okay with this). I made it clear throughout our relationship that constantly waiting around for her was a huge pet peeve of mine. It ultimately ended up being a factor in why I broke up with her, because she seemed completely unwilling to change and respect my time, even though she \"LoVeS mE sOoO mUcH\". And now, after we've moved on from the relationship and become platonic friends, she still HAS NOT CHANGED.\n\nSo yesterday I decided she needed to really learn this lesson. I knew fully leaving her behind would kinda come across as a dick move, but I have to draw the line somewhere. She cannot keep doing this to me. But I did kinda feel bad because she had prepaid for her lift ticket, and was probably looking forward to this little weekend getaway.

I\u2019m confused by the other judgments. You told her to be ready for 8, she wasn\u2019t. You tried contacting her and got no response. Why is it your responsibility to make sure another adult has their shit together? Yeah it sucks for her, but I can understand being done with chronic lateness. It\u2019s also not your job to exhaust all options to contact her so I\u2019m not sure why people are upset that you didn\u2019t bang the door down.", "NTA. You provided a time to be ready, gave extra time, and got no response when reaching out. Especially since this type of behavior has been a habit, I also would have left. If she can afford lift tickets, she can afford to find an alternative transportation method to get to the resort.", "NTA. The chronically late don't stop being chronically late until they start missing things they care about.  You warned her you'd give her a 15 minute grace period and you did.", "Definitely NTA! I've had a few friends like this. It's disrespectful of your time and plans and immature and unreliable, on her part!", "NTA. Sleeping through her alarm sounds like an excuse. She manages to wake up and go to work I bet. Sometimes people need to get a dose of consequences.", "NTA. Chronically late people send a clear message, they do not value your time. Time to move on from this one, she will never change.", "NTA.\n\nOne of my close friends is chronically late, and it's absolutely exhausting. I've stopped giving any sort of grace period with her because it's obvious she doesn't respect my (or anyone else's) time.\n\nIt's affecting our friendship more and more, and I am close to closing the chapter and ending the friendship completely, for this and various other reasons. \n\n8am sharp means 8am sharp. And I know exactly what you mean about that it would be at LEAST another 1/2 hour if you called or knocked and woke her up. Same thing would happen with my friend and I would be growing more irritated by the minute. Because it's not a one off thing, it's a consistent behavior.\n\nShe doesn't respect your time. It's up to you to decide if you can deal with that or not anymore. I think giving a 15 minute grace period was generous enough, and at this point with my friend I wouldn't even do that anymore.\n\nIf we keep accommodating chronically late people, they're never going to start respecting our time. Once or twice, okay. But consistently, nah. NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

But only because the time to set the boundary was before 7:50am when you wanted to leave at 8am.  When booking the trip just SAY \u201cI am leaving at 8AM sharp.  If you aren\u2019t ready at 8AM sharp, then I will be leaving without you.  Do you still want to come?\u201d. If that is clearly stated upfront, she gets to manage her choices as an adult.  And leaving her behind is totally fair.  But since you knew this about her ahead of time and didn\u2019t set up the expectations you are a very very very slight AH.\n\nI think many of the folks saying Y T A have not dealt with people who are always late and it\u2019s never their fault.  The boundary is totally fine and understandable.  Just communicate it up front.", "[deleted]", "INFO: Why didnt you go knock on the door?\n\nEDIT: Wait, you didnt even call her, did you? You send 2 texts? thats all?", "ESH  \nShe needs to learn some time management.  \nYou also could have called her. I've slept through my alarms, but I've been woken up by my phone ringing.", "Some ppl just can't be on time. \n\nI have a friend who is a successful lawyer and barely makes it to court. \n\nIt's zero personal she tries she's just somehow incapable. \n\nAnyhow my point is you can choose to not have such a person in your life, or understand that they will be late and plan accordingly and accept it. \n\nThey will not change bc they cannot.", "NTA. This wasn't a dick move, this was a consequence move.", "NTA. Since this is a pattern, then game on.", "[deleted]", "A little bit of ESH. \u201cI decided she really needed to learn this lesson\u201d makes you sound a bit like you went out of your way to punish her, just to make your point. Her unwillingness to conform to your time expectations already cost her your guys relationship, I\u2019m not sure you need to look for a way to further rub it in. There is also a cultural aspect to \u201ctimeliness\u201d where it\u2019s a big deal for some, and not for others. Clearly it\u2019s important to you, and it isn\u2019t to her. At some point you need to stop trying to make her conform into someone she isn\u2019t. The flip side is she has to understand that her lack of concern about time does have consequences. If she doesn\u2019t want to/can\u2019t be bothered to adjust, then she has to understand that she will lose out on opportunities. Friendships are in many ways just like relationships, you have to decide if the friendship is worth putting up with her tardiness. If it\u2019s going to constantly be a problem for you then I\u2019d just move on from the friendship. If her friendship is worth more than your value of timeliness than you need to find a way to either accommodate it or let her know that she will miss out on things in the future because of it.", "Totally agree. If you want to try to help her, you could reminder text when you're up/getting ready, then give a quick text/call before you head out.", "Well 4 texts technically. \n\nI didn\u2019t knock because she lives with her parents who were probably asleep at that hour and didn\u2019t wanna wake them up. I figure texts would be enough. I mean I guess I coulda called but if her alarms couldn\u2019t wake her up, then I doubt a call would.", "A tirade? All he said was that she was late for everything when they were dating and that her parents treat her like a child. That's two things. Hardly a tirade, and It serves to illustrate that this isn't the first time something like this has happened.\n\nHe texted her several times and maybe he didn't ring the bell because she's not the only one who lives there and he didn't want to wake someone else up. \n\nIf you're upset by his behavior, then I'm guessing you're about as respectful of other people's time as she is.", "[deleted]", "But even if I\u2019d woken her up with a knock or text, I know she would\u2019ve taken at least another half hour to get her shit ready. So more wasted time. She was supposed to be READY TO GO for 8am sharp.", "Nah.  It's her fault.  She knows herself too.", "[deleted]", "It doesn't matter.  She was told it was a sharp time.  She blew it off, why does she get special accommodation for being disrespectful?", "NTA.", "NTA. If she was taking a bus or a plane to the destination, would she have called the ticket office to complain because they left without her? I hope you had fun!", "Nope nope nope, NTA. I also cannot stand when people are chronically late. It's just so disrespectful. Once or twice on a rare occasion, fine I get it shit happens but when it's a pattern, it's a pattern of disrespect I just will not tolerate. I would honestly dump someone solely for that.", "Does your Uber driver come knock on your door when you don't come out to the car? Do you set up travel arrangements where someone is doing you the favor of providing transportation then crap all over the value of their time by not even bothering to be awake?", "NTA. I used to be late constantly. I never meant it as an offense. But I understand it shows a lack of valuing others' time and, in turn, respect. I've worked hard to change over the years and made many strides. I was also finally diagnosed with ADHD. In retrospect, I was often late because I had difficulty getting ready promptly, keeping track of time, and getting distracted when I should have focused on preparing and keeping to the planned time.\n\nIt's embarrassing in retrospect, but I can only work to do better now. I hope my efforts show others I do, in fact, respect them.\n\nThat being said, you weren't cruel. You respected and protected your time because she didn't. Having been in her shoes, it hurts. She might have issues she needs to address. But that is not on you. And perhaps this can be a prompt for her to finally discover the root cause, if there is one, and handle it.\n\nThat's how it worked for me. After enough times that others moved on without me and expressed their frustrations, I finally took action on something I wanted and needed to change. It took a while, with a lot practice and now treatment of my particular issue. But I likely wouldn't have sought to change without my loved ones' honesty and actions.", "NTA. Expectations and consequences were clearly communicated.  Not to mention that since she slept late, she could always have driven herself to the ski area and used her own lift ticket.", "NTA", "Does her boss do that? I doubt it.", "\u201cAnd now, after we\u2019ve moved on from the relationship and become platonic friends, she still HAS NOT CHANGED\u201d made me laugh (was she supposed to?), but coupled with \u201cI decided she really needed to learn this lesson,\u201d it makes you sound controlling af.\n\nThe situation itself? NTA. But the way you talk about it gives me the grues. Don\u2019t be that person.", "ESH. Her for not respecting other people\u2019s time, and you for deciding \u201cshe really needs to learn this lesson.\u201d Are you friends with her only to punish her for the things she didn\u2019t do \u201cright\u201d when you were dating? It\u2019s her business. Stop hanging out with her if she\u2019s so objectionable to you, instead of trying to force her to change.", "NTA.\n\nGood luck on busy season, I worked for PwC back in the day so I know your pain.", "NTA", "NTA.  And I'm the chronically late friend.  But I own my screwups.", "I had a friend like this too. Over 2 hours late one time to a 3 hour event. We vacationed together and nearly missed excursions. It was awful. Along with this complete disregard for anyones time she was also a lot of drama. In the end the drama did me in more than the disrespect for anyones time."]}
