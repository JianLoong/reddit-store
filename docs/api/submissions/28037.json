She was out of high school and lived with our grandparents. It was not a good time for her. \n\nHer half brother and I were both in grade twelve and we had jobs. We decided to help her out. Of our own free will. No one asked us to or asked is for money. We just love her and knew she needed support. She had a girl named Calli. We helped buy diapers and formula. We babysat so J. could work and go out every once in a while. \n\nJ. Met a nice guy and married him two years ago. He has two kids from a previous relationship that he gets on the weekends. \n\nCalli is 12 now and I still hang out with her. \n\nLately J. has been asking me to take out her stepkids when I take Calli out. I told her no. I don't really know those kids and I don't really want to be responsible for them. I like spoiling my little cousin but that's it. She has been great practice for when I have kids. Plus I love being a bad influence on her. I just took her skeet shooting and we are going to an ax throwing place where you can also use knives or throwing stars. \n\nJ. says that I'm creating a schism between her kids because Calli comes back from hanging out with me and the other kids get jealous. She says I should take all the kids or stop doing stuff with Calli. Calli heard her and she may have picked up some language from me because she was very vocal about her displeasure. \n\nMy mom thinks I should take the kids. I said I would if she would come keep an eye on them around the axes, knives and throwing stars. She said  we could take the kids to a bouncy play area.  I said she could take the kids there while Calli and I did our thing and we could catch up after. She said I was missing the point.

Kids need to learn to manage disappointment and this is a great opportunity for them to get some practice in. Not everything in life is fair and equal, and that can be painful to accept, but it is also a reality that we must accept in life.", "NTA. If it's causing problems then really, J and her husband should be handling those problems so that Calli doesn't suffer by losing her close relationship with you.", "NTA. I don't get these people who constantly forces a relationship between people. If one party does not want it, it will be very obvious, especially to kids. This is not a promo, where you get a whole family pack for the price of one. \n\nYou want to spend your time with Calli, then you only need to take Calli. Especially now that she's a pre-teen and can actually decide if she wants to spend time with you or not. Even if you force yourself to include them, they'll probably feel worse because they'll see the closeness you and Calli has and know that they're not part of that bond.\n\nPersonally, I'd just be thankful that I have extended family taking care of Calli and loving her the way you do.", "NTA if the dad has the kids only on the weekends, then he needs to spend time with them on the weekends and not dump them on you.  Sounds like J and the new man in her life want kid free weekends and for you to foot the bill.", "NTA. Does your cousins husband's family take Calli when they take his kids? I'm guessing not. They have their own family", "NTA. You already have an established bond with Calli. You shouldn't need to establish a new bond with every new person in Js life because she wants you too. She's not entitled to dictate your relationships.", "NTA. I hate when people act like blending a family means that they can never do anything alone anymore. Imo Calli is allowed to get away from her step siblings if she wants to & it\u2019s honestly probably a very healthy outlet for her given her mom\u2019s attitude towards it. Plus its really unreasonable for her to expect you to do it alone. But this here is imo the important tidbit. She wants time to herself which is why she\u2019s harping in this, I would bet it has nothing to with the other kids & everything to do with the fact that your time wiyh Calli is no longer a break for her.", "NTA. If Calli is 12 and the step kids are young enough for a bouncy castle it isn't the same thing at all.  They are way too young for the things that OP and Calli are doing. All J is going to do is make Calls resent the young ones. If J wants some time she should hire a babysitter because OP and her mom aren't up for it.", "NTA\n\nSince Mr. Nice Guy only gets his kids on weekends, presumably his stepkids have relationships that Calli isn't a part of.  I think it's okay for Calli to have relationships that the stepkids aren't a part of.  \n\nWhen Calli spends time with you, then the stepkids get more undivided attention from their Dad, right?  Isn't that a good thing?", "NTA.\n\n The step kids have a side of their family that isn't Calli's. Does she go with them when they are with their bio mom's family? I doubt it. If Calli having a relationship with her cousin, is causing tension with the step kids, it's step mom and dad's responsibility to explain the blended family dynamic to the step kids, not punish Calli. And if that fails, explaining that their step sister is allowed to have friends/experiences that don't include them, just as they'll eventually go out into the world and do their thing too. That's life and it's the parent's job-not to enable or try to make it fair- but to teach their kids to accept what is and to work within the parameters of what is available to them. Calli shouldn't have to lose time with her family member because of her step siblings. That's a sure fire way to ensure Calli becomes resentful of her entire immediate (step) family.", "Nta. I think they are the ones missing the point. Her husband as custody of his kids during the weekend. If anyone needs to step up and take them places and do fun things with them it\u2019s him. If he doesn\u2019t want too then he should just give their mom full custody. Besides I don\u2019t think their mom will be happy is she knew he gets to see them two days a week and instead of him doing something with them a person she probably doesn\u2019t know is watching them.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your cousin responsibility to nurture the relationship between her child and her step children.  I\u2019ve been in your position.  I helped and supported until a new guy moved in and was then cast as the villain because I didn\u2019t treat him the same as I treated my cousin.  Rinse and repeat.    \nI finally came to the realization that how I chose to spend my time and money is my right.  As was her right to determine who/how people interacted with her child?  I hope you are able to come to a compromise.", "NTA her saying you're missing the point is almost comedic, it was and still is your decision who you spend your time and money on, you do this because you have a connection with her not just because they're your cousins kid, the other kids need to understand that they can't always have the things they want, so does the cousin, she can't just expect you to do these things. She basically wants you to be a free babysitter and is taking away something meaningful from her daughter if you don't comply and after everything you've done for her, that is entirely disrespectful.", "NTA. You have a relationship with your relative. Steps don\u2019t have to be your concern.", "Info: how old are your step cousins? They sound very young if your mother is suggesting a bouncy play area.", "NTA.", "NTA - unless J consulted you before getting into a relationship with this guy and his baggage and asked for your permission, then you have no ties or obligation to anyone other than Calli.", ">I said she could take the kids there while Calli and I did our thing \n\nHeh. This is The Way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She said I was missing the point.\n\nOf \\*course\\* she did.\n\nIt sounds like J, whom you and her half-brother directly supported as you were able  when you were young adults yourselves -- when perhaps adults in the family didn't? Well, J needs to now do that part of step-parenting which involves guiding her step-kids to a place where they understand some things are not their things and some relationships they do not have automatic access to. \\*She\\* has to navigate getting them to understand why Calli's relationship / time spent with you is different.\n\n(Assuming you're not being overtly mean to the step-kids.)\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt is not your responsibility to teach J's step children that life is not fair, and sometimes you don't get to do things other people are doing. It is also pretty fucked up that J is willing to cause damage to their own daughter for the sake of the step children by saying it is all kids or nothing.", "NTA", "NTA. A 12 year old should have activities that do not involve bouncy-house-aged children. Both parents should be eternally grateful that an almost teenager has another loving adult participating with positive activities. Sure, it would be great if eventually you spend some time with all the kids, but you don't owe them anything. I suggest a movie night at their home while the parents go out. You & your brother have already gone above and beyond what any cousins would do.\n\nEdit: *her* half brother", "NTA \n\nYour sister chose to marry a man with two children. When they are in her house she needs to treat them (age-appropriately) equally to her child.\n\nYou have a strong pre-existing bond with Calli and Calli alone. Enjoy it. \n\nIf your cousin is upset because her stepkids feel like they are missing out, then your cousin can take them out herself.", "You are correct, you don't. It's the age-old \"we're all one family, you have to treat all the kids the same!\" crap. But Calli is your second cousin you're close to since birth, and the others are your cousin's stepkids he only gets on weekends anyway, and they have nothing to do with you. J and your mom can do as many activities with Calli and the stepkids together as they like (not to mention their dad can). NTA", "NTA. You're not obligated to babysit some dude's kids for free just because he's fucking your cousin.", "NAH I understand why you want to keep doing your thing but I also understand why your cousin wants her step kids included. It feels like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place. \n\nThere's clearly a noticeable age difference between the kids though, if your mom is suggesting a bouncy house while you're taking Calli to axe throwing. I'm sure Calli would feel punished if she got dragged to a bouncy house.", "Sigh. Why do so many people think when they get married all the children become some weird sort of conjoined entity?\n\nThey're individuals, they can be treated individually. Obviously don't blatantly neglect one for another. But at what point do parents just teach their kids that everything isn't for everybody, and how to deal? Cause guess what, in the \"real world\" you don't get everything you want just cause you want it.\n\nCalli's relationship w you shouldn't have to suffer from forced togetherness. And if it *does*, well imagine how happy Calli will be with her mom, step-dad, and step-sibs.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. Does Calli get to do whatever the kids do with their mom? Probably not. You invited her to come and bring the other kids, so she clearly isn't really worried about the kids, she just wants kid free time with a free babysitter bc they have the kids every weekend.", "NTA - the kids are your sister's step children. If you do not acknowledge them as your nieces/nephews, that is up to you - you are under no obligation to entertain them. However, be advised that your sister may start restricting your time with Calli, even if it upsets her daughter.", "NTA but honestly whenever i read these sort of posts i imagine the perspective of the step kids and i know it probably hurts them. i think it\u2019s also depends on how ur cousins husbands family treats your cousin, do they treat her differently from the step siblings?", "If this is a real post, Calli is too young for axe throwing. However, your cousin is unreasonable to think it will be fun for Calli to go to bouncy houses with her younger stepsiblings. That makes me wonder if J has stopped serving Calli's age-appropriate needs and just makes Calli do things that the younger stepchildren want to do, and whether Calli never gets time alone with her mother any more. It also sounds a bit like J is used to having adult time without childcare duties (because you have always helped with Calli) and wants you to continue to provide that by caring for all three of the children she is now responsible for.\n\nI think it is a bit manipulative of J to tell you that you should either stop hanging out with Calli or take all three children with you (thereby only planning things the younger kids can do, as axe throwing is definitely going to be off the table for them). You have a pre-existing relationship with Calli that you likely wouldn't have if you weren't trying to support J through her teenage pregnancy. Now J wants to control, modify, or end that relationship now that the relationship is mutually rewarding for you and Calli, rather than being only about you supporting J and Calli.\n\nIf you want to come up with a couple of fun things to do with the younger kids, I think that is fine. You can start slow and get to know them. But I think expecting you to become part-time babysitter yet again, to kids you don't know, so J can have an easier parenting journey, is not appropriate. You don't exist just to serve J's priorities and I think it is \"user-ish\" of her to try to punish you for not following her priorities by telling you to drop your relationship with Calli if you won't start a whole new set of babysitting responsibilities. She would also be punishing Calli this way (since you are a trusted adult who is a key part of Calli's support network) , which makes me not too impressed with J.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to always include them. It might be nice to invite them occasionally to something but you aren\u2019t required to.", "Does Calli go when those kids do things with their bio family? I doubt it. Its the same thing. She deserves individual experiences too.", "INFO. Why isn\u2019t the new husband entertaining his own kids?", "off topic but can you be my big cousin?

Looking after 3 kids is no small task! Why doesn\u2019t she use that time to build a bond with her step children?

I definitely understand not wanting to be responsible for the kids when you are doing dangerous activities like ax throwing but damn you can\u2019t even throw in a simple McDonald\u2019s trip or something one day? Assuming you are provided the money to pay for the other children as that definitely shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility. \n\nI think my ultimate vote is NAH. It\u2019s not on you to take out any children you don\u2019t want to take out but I also cannot blame your cousin for bringing up the issues it\u2019s causing in their family.

What does their father think?\n\nThis is, however, not a straightforward asshole test. There is no worse age than being a 12 year old girl and the sort of bond and consistent outlet that you give her is vital and needs to be protected. And it seems to be really good for you, too.

She shouldn\u2019t have to loose out on your special time just because mom married someone with kids, plus your cousin should remind herself of everything you have done for her & her daughter out of kindness and appreciate it not except you to take on more kids that you have expressed you have no desire to take (and that is your right)", "NTA.", "NTA. You have a long relationship with Calli and none with her stepsiblings. Calli could use one on one attention. J can handle the jealousy differently. Her stepchildren are old enough to understand family dynamics. Refuse to discuss it anymore.", "NTA.   Blended families aren\u2019t ever really blended.  Your family is your niece.  Those other kids are the kids of her lover. Not family.  Nothing will ever really make it true.  Your goodwill ends where you say it does. Let your niece know that you are there for her- as family and enjoy her company as it is.  Taking all the kids makes it something you and your niece don\u2019t want or need. It merely makes her mother feel and pretend her family is a cohesive group.  It\u2019s a collection of individuals brought together to benefit the two adults having sex. And no pretending it\u2019s your family will make it so.", "NTA because you aren't obligated to do any of this but it will only cost you a few dollars to be a nice person to these kids who clearly want to be included someway.

Cool that you\u2019ve got an opinion to the contrary, but OP is dealing with J, not with you, and J has said: \u201ceither take all the kids or stop doing stuff with Calli\u201d.\n\nSo OP can either take J\u2019s feedback that his visits w Calli are disruptive and work with her to find a less disruptive way of interacting, or he\u2019s going to find himself out of the picture.", "Or, dad could spend time with all 3 kids and build the family bond that way. Too bad OP is now outta luck\u2026", "I wish Reddit had laugh reacts.", "They'd be second cousins.", "It\u2019s not OP\u2019s job to father J\u2019s stepkids.", "Lol, no, Calli seeing her uncle for a few hours occasionally is not disrupting their relationship just because mom said so. Mom is probably trying to get the rest of the kids out of the house too so she can have some downtime, otherwise she would be offering to bring them too, which OP said he would take them if she was there too. But she didn\u2019t like that, because she wants all the kids out of the house. \n\nThat, or she doesn\u2019t want to address the stepchildren\u2019s entitlement, and wants to end the situation by making OP take all of them. \n\nLiterally there is *no* way Calli going out with *her* uncle for some quality time is going to irreparably damage these kid\u2019s relationships. That is absurd. The mother is being absurd not prioritizing her child in that situation.", "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s not OP\u2019s job to father J\u2019s step kids. When figuring out how much to engage with J\u2019s step kids so that J doesn\u2019t curtail his relationship with Calli, \u201cfather\u201d would be many steps too far.", "Well okay then. Great job solving the situation you made up where Calli\u2019s mom just lies about stuff to manipulate OP. Good thing you\u2019re here so he knows not to fall for it like his poor naive mother did!\n\nI\u2019m sure that will be great consolation to OP when he can\u2019t book his next outing with his little niece.", "Well, good job solving the situation where Calli begins to resent her step-siblings because she can\u2019t even have her relationship with her uncle to herself anymore. I\u2019m sure that one would go better? \n\nLol, all I\u2019m saying is that Calli deserves her independent time over her step-siblings whining. They need to learn that there\u2019s plenty of terrible stuff that happens in life, but one of them is not not being able to go out with your step-sibling\u2019s uncle on their private time. Mom can handle such a mundane issue on her own, OP should be able to hang out with his niece.\n\nSeriously, this is like saying two kids fighting over who turns off the light switch is going to destroy their relationship. It\u2019s an uncle hanging out with his niece, and the siblings are just complaining about it, doesn\u2019t mean they need to go along.", "I get that you feel you are going to bat for Calli. You understand that I\u2019m not J though, right? Dealing with any resentment is going to be J\u2019s problem. That\u2019s parenting, evaluating whether Calli\u2019s weekly/fortnightly/monthly/quarterly outing with uncle worth the drama that it causes when she gets home. Would ending those outings be worse, or is it the best way to keep the peace in a house of five.\n\nAll OP can do is work with J to mitigate that concern. Maybe get J to pay for them all to go for pancakes to start. Or not and hope it\u2019s a bluff. I definitely wouldn\u2019t suggest accusing J of lying about the drama though."]}
