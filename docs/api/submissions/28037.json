She was out of high school and lived with our grandparents. It was not a good time for her. \n\nHer half brother and I were both in grade twelve and we had jobs. We decided to help her out. Of our own free will. No one asked us to or asked is for money. We just love her and knew she needed support. She had a girl named Calli. We helped buy diapers and formula. We babysat so J. could work and go out every once in a while. \n\nJ. Met a nice guy and married him two years ago. He has two kids from a previous relationship that he gets on the weekends. \n\nCalli is 12 now and I still hang out with her. \n\nLately J. has been asking me to take out her stepkids when I take Calli out. I told her no. I don't really know those kids and I don't really want to be responsible for them. I like spoiling my little cousin but that's it. She has been great practice for when I have kids. Plus I love being a bad influence on her. I just took her skeet shooting and we are going to an ax throwing place where you can also use knives or throwing stars. \n\nJ. says that I'm creating a schism between her kids because Calli comes back from hanging out with me and the other kids get jealous. She says I should take all the kids or stop doing stuff with Calli. Calli heard her and she may have picked up some language from me because she was very vocal about her displeasure. \n\nMy mom thinks I should take the kids. I said I would if she would come keep an eye on them around the axes, knives and throwing stars. She said  we could take the kids to a bouncy play area.  I said she could take the kids there while Calli and I did our thing and we could catch up after. She said I was missing the point.

Kids need to learn to manage disappointment and this is a great opportunity for them to get some practice in. Not everything in life is fair and equal, and that can be painful to accept, but it is also a reality that we must accept in life.", "NTA. If it's causing problems then really, J and her husband should be handling those problems so that Calli doesn't suffer by losing her close relationship with you.", "NTA. I don't get these people who constantly forces a relationship between people. If one party does not want it, it will be very obvious, especially to kids. This is not a promo, where you get a whole family pack for the price of one. \n\nYou want to spend your time with Calli, then you only need to take Calli. Especially now that she's a pre-teen and can actually decide if she wants to spend time with you or not. Even if you force yourself to include them, they'll probably feel worse because they'll see the closeness you and Calli has and know that they're not part of that bond.\n\nPersonally, I'd just be thankful that I have extended family taking care of Calli and loving her the way you do.", "NTA if the dad has the kids only on the weekends, then he needs to spend time with them on the weekends and not dump them on you.  Sounds like J and the new man in her life want kid free weekends and for you to foot the bill.", "NTA. Does your cousins husband's family take Calli when they take his kids? I'm guessing not. They have their own family", "NTA. You already have an established bond with Calli. You shouldn't need to establish a new bond with every new person in Js life because she wants you too. She's not entitled to dictate your relationships.", "NTA. I hate when people act like blending a family means that they can never do anything alone anymore. Imo Calli is allowed to get away from her step siblings if she wants to & it\u2019s honestly probably a very healthy outlet for her given her mom\u2019s attitude towards it. Plus its really unreasonable for her to expect you to do it alone. But this here is imo the important tidbit. She wants time to herself which is why she\u2019s harping in this, I would bet it has nothing to with the other kids & everything to do with the fact that your time wiyh Calli is no longer a break for her.", "NTA. If Calli is 12 and the step kids are young enough for a bouncy castle it isn't the same thing at all.  They are way too young for the things that OP and Calli are doing. All J is going to do is make Calls resent the young ones. If J wants some time she should hire a babysitter because OP and her mom aren't up for it.", "NTA\n\nSince Mr. Nice Guy only gets his kids on weekends, presumably his stepkids have relationships that Calli isn't a part of.  I think it's okay for Calli to have relationships that the stepkids aren't a part of.  \n\nWhen Calli spends time with you, then the stepkids get more undivided attention from their Dad, right?  Isn't that a good thing?", "NTA.\n\n The step kids have a side of their family that isn't Calli's. Does she go with them when they are with their bio mom's family? I doubt it. If Calli having a relationship with her cousin, is causing tension with the step kids, it's step mom and dad's responsibility to explain the blended family dynamic to the step kids, not punish Calli. And if that fails, explaining that their step sister is allowed to have friends/experiences that don't include them, just as they'll eventually go out into the world and do their thing too. That's life and it's the parent's job-not to enable or try to make it fair- but to teach their kids to accept what is and to work within the parameters of what is available to them. Calli shouldn't have to lose time with her family member because of her step siblings. That's a sure fire way to ensure Calli becomes resentful of her entire immediate (step) family.", "Nta. I think they are the ones missing the point. Her husband as custody of his kids during the weekend. If anyone needs to step up and take them places and do fun things with them it\u2019s him. If he doesn\u2019t want too then he should just give their mom full custody. Besides I don\u2019t think their mom will be happy is she knew he gets to see them two days a week and instead of him doing something with them a person she probably doesn\u2019t know is watching them.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your cousin responsibility to nurture the relationship between her child and her step children.  I\u2019ve been in your position.  I helped and supported until a new guy moved in and was then cast as the villain because I didn\u2019t treat him the same as I treated my cousin.  Rinse and repeat.    \nI finally came to the realization that how I chose to spend my time and money is my right.  As was her right to determine who/how people interacted with her child?  I hope you are able to come to a compromise.", "NTA her saying you're missing the point is almost comedic, it was and still is your decision who you spend your time and money on, you do this because you have a connection with her not just because they're your cousins kid, the other kids need to understand that they can't always have the things they want, so does the cousin, she can't just expect you to do these things. She basically wants you to be a free babysitter and is taking away something meaningful from her daughter if you don't comply and after everything you've done for her, that is entirely disrespectful.", "NTA. You have a relationship with your relative. Steps don\u2019t have to be your concern.", "Info: how old are your step cousins? They sound very young if your mother is suggesting a bouncy play area.", "NTA.", "NTA - unless J consulted you before getting into a relationship with this guy and his baggage and asked for your permission, then you have no ties or obligation to anyone other than Calli.", ">I said she could take the kids there while Calli and I did our thing \n\nHeh. This is The Way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She said I was missing the point.\n\nOf \\*course\\* she did.\n\nIt sounds like J, whom you and her half-brother directly supported as you were able  when you were young adults yourselves -- when perhaps adults in the family didn't? Well, J needs to now do that part of step-parenting which involves guiding her step-kids to a place where they understand some things are not their things and some relationships they do not have automatic access to. \\*She\\* has to navigate getting them to understand why Calli's relationship / time spent with you is different.\n\n(Assuming you're not being overtly mean to the step-kids.)\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt is not your responsibility to teach J's step children that life is not fair, and sometimes you don't get to do things other people are doing. It is also pretty fucked up that J is willing to cause damage to their own daughter for the sake of the step children by saying it is all kids or nothing.", "NTA", "NTA. A 12 year old should have activities that do not involve bouncy-house-aged children. Both parents should be eternally grateful that an almost teenager has another loving adult participating with positive activities. Sure, it would be great if eventually you spend some time with all the kids, but you don't owe them anything. I suggest a movie night at their home while the parents go out. You & your brother have already gone above and beyond what any cousins would do.\n\nEdit: *her* half brother", "NTA \n\nYour sister chose to marry a man with two children. When they are in her house she needs to treat them (age-appropriately) equally to her child.\n\nYou have a strong pre-existing bond with Calli and Calli alone. Enjoy it. \n\nIf your cousin is upset because her stepkids feel like they are missing out, then your cousin can take them out herself.", "You are correct, you don't. It's the age-old \"we're all one family, you have to treat all the kids the same!\" crap. But Calli is your second cousin you're close to since birth, and the others are your cousin's stepkids he only gets on weekends anyway, and they have nothing to do with you. J and your mom can do as many activities with Calli and the stepkids together as they like (not to mention their dad can). NTA", "NTA. You're not obligated to babysit some dude's kids for free just because he's fucking your cousin.", "NAH I understand why you want to keep doing your thing but I also understand why your cousin wants her step kids included. It feels like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place. \n\nThere's clearly a noticeable age difference between the kids though, if your mom is suggesting a bouncy house while you're taking Calli to axe throwing. I'm sure Calli would feel punished if she got dragged to a bouncy house.", "Sigh. Why do so many people think when they get married all the children become some weird sort of conjoined entity?\n\nThey're individuals, they can be treated individually. Obviously don't blatantly neglect one for another. But at what point do parents just teach their kids that everything isn't for everybody, and how to deal? Cause guess what, in the \"real world\" you don't get everything you want just cause you want it.\n\nCalli's relationship w you shouldn't have to suffer from forced togetherness. And if it *does*, well imagine how happy Calli will be with her mom, step-dad, and step-sibs.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. Does Calli get to do whatever the kids do with their mom? Probably not. You invited her to come and bring the other kids, so she clearly isn't really worried about the kids, she just wants kid free time with a free babysitter bc they have the kids every weekend.", "NTA - the kids are your sister's step children. If you do not acknowledge them as your nieces/nephews, that is up to you - you are under no obligation to entertain them. However, be advised that your sister may start restricting your time with Calli, even if it upsets her daughter.", "NTA but honestly whenever i read these sort of posts i imagine the perspective of the step kids and i know it probably hurts them. i think it\u2019s also depends on how ur cousins husbands family treats your cousin, do they treat her differently from the step siblings?", "If this is a real post, Calli is too young for axe throwing. However, your cousin is unreasonable to think it will be fun for Calli to go to bouncy houses with her younger stepsiblings. That makes me wonder if J has stopped serving Calli's age-appropriate needs and just makes Calli do things that the younger stepchildren want to do, and whether Calli never gets time alone with her mother any more. It also sounds a bit like J is used to having adult time without childcare duties (because you have always helped with Calli) and wants you to continue to provide that by caring for all three of the children she is now responsible for.\n\nI think it is a bit manipulative of J to tell you that you should either stop hanging out with Calli or take all three children with you (thereby only planning things the younger kids can do, as axe throwing is definitely going to be off the table for them). You have a pre-existing relationship with Calli that you likely wouldn't have if you weren't trying to support J through her teenage pregnancy. Now J wants to control, modify, or end that relationship now that the relationship is mutually rewarding for you and Calli, rather than being only about you supporting J and Calli.\n\nIf you want to come up with a couple of fun things to do with the younger kids, I think that is fine. You can start slow and get to know them. But I think expecting you to become part-time babysitter yet again, to kids you don't know, so J can have an easier parenting journey, is not appropriate. You don't exist just to serve J's priorities and I think it is \"user-ish\" of her to try to punish you for not following her priorities by telling you to drop your relationship with Calli if you won't start a whole new set of babysitting responsibilities. She would also be punishing Calli this way (since you are a trusted adult who is a key part of Calli's support network) , which makes me not too impressed with J.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to always include them. It might be nice to invite them occasionally to something but you aren\u2019t required to.", "Does Calli go when those kids do things with their bio family? I doubt it. Its the same thing.

Looking after 3 kids is no small task! Why doesn\u2019t she use that time to build a bond with her step children?

I definitely understand not wanting to be responsible for the kids when you are doing dangerous activities like ax throwing but damn you can\u2019t even throw in a simple McDonald\u2019s trip or something one day? Assuming you are provided the money to pay for the other children as that definitely shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility. \n\nI think my ultimate vote is NAH. It\u2019s not on you to take out any children you don\u2019t want to take out but I also cannot blame your cousin for bringing up the issues it\u2019s causing in their family.

What does their father think?\n\nThis is, however, not a straightforward asshole test. There is no worse age than being a 12 year old girl and the sort of bond and consistent outlet that you give her is vital and needs to be protected. And it seems to be really good for you, too.

She shouldn\u2019t have to loose out on your special time just because mom married someone with kids, plus your cousin should remind herself of everything you have done for her & her daughter out of kindness and appreciate it not except you to take on more kids that you have expressed you have no desire to take (and that is your right)", "NTA.", "NTA. You have a long relationship with Calli and none with her stepsiblings. Calli could use one on one attention. J can handle the jealousy differently. Her stepchildren are old enough to understand family dynamics. Refuse to discuss it anymore.", "NTA.   Blended families aren\u2019t ever really blended.  Your family is your niece.  Those other kids are the kids of her lover. Not family.  Nothing will ever really make it true.  Your goodwill ends where you say it does. Let your niece know that you are there for her- as family and enjoy her company as it is.  Taking all the kids makes it something you and your niece don\u2019t want or need. It merely makes her mother feel and pretend her family is a cohesive group.  It\u2019s a collection of individuals brought together to benefit the two adults having sex. And no pretending it\u2019s your family will make it so.", "NTA because you aren't obligated to do any of this but it will only cost you a few dollars to be a nice person to these kids who clearly want to be included someway.

You may not view her step kids as family, but she clearly does and is wanting them to blend. That\u2019s hard to do and you\u2019re making it harder. \n\nShe would be 100% in the right to say you cannot take Calli out anymore, so that she can foster her family in a healthy way. \n\nThere\u2019s such an easy solution to this and it would be for you and your cousin to sit down and make a plan - have days where you all go out together and do an activity as a group. But you still get a one on one special date with Calli once in awhile too.

But she didn\u2019t like that, because she wants all the kids out of the house. \n\nThat, or she doesn\u2019t want to address the stepchildren\u2019s entitlement, and wants to end the situation by making OP take all of them. \n\nLiterally there is *no* way Calli going out with *her* uncle for some quality time is going to irreparably damage these kid\u2019s relationships.

Mom can handle such a mundane issue on her own, OP should be able to hang out with his niece.\n\nSeriously, this is like saying two kids fighting over who turns off the light switch is going to destroy their relationship.

It\u2019s been years and you\u2019ve never made an effort to welcome them.", "um first of all, you saying you like being a bad influence is horrible and idk why you would brag about that. I would just say you couldn\u2019t take Calli anymore if I was mom tbh.", "Yta you are causing a division in that family", "YTA for being proud of being the bad influence. You tried so hard to church it up by mentioning the bad influence is things like skeet shooting or are throwing as opposed to toilet mouth or other un mentioned things you've influenced the child with.", "YTA  - these are children you speaking about. You are going to make the other kids resent Calli and that may cause problems down the line. Understandably you cannot take them on \"dangerous\" outings, but take them with sometimes.", "NTA. You have know Calli since she was born and your relationship with her is very different than with the other kids. I am from a blended family and I as a kid, got used to it that since me and my stepsiblings had different parents and relatives, we don't always get the same things. My stepsister would brag me about getting new jeans and school supplies, while I could tell her that our family is going for a vacation next winter or that I am going for horse riding lesson because my uncle paid for it, while she would tell me her aunt gave her bunch of her old toys that are worth a lot of money.\n\nYou don't need to take responsibility of any other kids that Calli if you don't want to, and it's good for the stepkids to also learn that not everyone gets the same things - since you have different family and relatives. It would have been ridiculous for my stepmom to buy me stuff too, just because she got something for her daughter and it would have been ridiculous if my aunt would've had to take my stepsister with us when we went to do something fun, because they don't even know each other! I would also feel uncomfortable as Calli in this situation, because she needs to be the one to \"connect\" you and the other kids, and she would probably worry about you getting along nicely rather than spending quality time with you!", "NTA", "NTA mainly because those kids are a little on the young side for those activities with just one adult trying to manage them. I will say, I hope your cousin isn't the type to not let her daughter go out with you anymore out of spite.", "NTA.  J should be kissing your butt since you are doing J a favor out of kindness.\n\nAdditionally, instead of your mom giving you a hard time, then let *her* take the kids.", "NTA.  The step kids have their own family from their mother's side.  You've had one on one time with Callie since she was born and want to continue that relationship.  J can do something special with her step kids when you and Calli are out, everyone can have a special day.", "NTA\n\nThey need to teach the stepkids that they may not be involved in every outing Calli is involved in no matter who invites her.

I have two uncle's and two siblings, siblings both 8+ years younger than me. \n\nThe artist uncle made stuff with me and did many creative things and got me art supplies, my siblings saw him at those birthday's he decided to show up to. \n\nThe other uncle was my godfather too and as I was little we spent much time together, vacations, day trips, etc, as they got a kid and I was older my sister was in the same age as their kid they took her instead of me (my teenage behind had better to do \ud83d\ude44), our brother who is only a couple years younger than her didn't get any of that. \n\nThe thing is, no one else can decide for you what you do with your time, money, etc and who you spend it on or with and don't let anyone tell you something different. \n\nThe only person that is responsible for equality for their kids and that are their parents they absolutely should treat their kids the same but no one else has.", "NTA. *However* it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to coordinate the occasional group outing if *Calli* wants to do so. You are under no obligation to do it for anyone else.", "Not the asshole. Honestly, it's a good lesson that they can't always get what they want. \nIt would be extra nice to include them once in a while, but I don't think you should HAVE to take them every time you take out Calli.", "NTA. You have done so much already to help your cousin and your relationship with Calli sounds really good.   Taking responsibility for two kids you don't know and also paying extra to take them with you is too much and it would also mean less attention for Calli and you might become less close with her.   Don't your cousin's stepchildren have extended family of their own who could be more involved in their lives?", "NTA", "NTA, but YTA. \n\nI feel bad for kids. We all consider them a burden these days. I think there is a way you could still mostly hang out with your little cousin one on one and occasionally include the steps, or you could ask your mom along and the both of you could take all three kids. \n\nYou are under no obligation to hang out with these other kids, but if you have it in your heart, it would be nice to do so when you do have the capacity.", "Wants free childcare sounds like", "NTA - just because I don't think it's warranted. It's your money, your choice, you do what you want, BUT you do create a schism with this behavior. Like it or not these 2 step siblings of Calli are your family now, and yeah this behavior definitely will make those kids feel left out.

That's just rude.", "Calli is your special friend, not your cousins stepkids.  Stick  to your guns and continue to take Calli out for your special times together.  It sounds like you're a really good influence on her, except maybe for the language but that's sort of expected at that age today.  NTAH.", "NTA.  It's absurd for anyone to think that you'd develop the same kind of relationship with these other kids.  Not your job, not your responsibility.", "Hang out with calli when the kids aren't over n ur problem is kinda solved.", "So you love J, and you love Calli, but you have no interest in getting to know J's stepkids or helping Calli have a good relationship with them, and thus help J build a strong family. Got it. YTA. Please stop being so selfish. I understand that the new dynamic creates some challenges. And I very much sympathize with your implied fear of losing your special closeness with Calli--that's real and you've worked hard to maintain it. But things change, and we have to adapt. Brainstorming with Calli about ways to overcome the challenge and be fair to her step-sibs and her mom (b/c presumably hanging out with Calli has helped free up her time for other things, but leaving out the step-sibs from your plans does not) would help strengthen your bond. Compromise is be a good lesson for everyone here: you can still have times that are just for you and Calli, balanced fairly (this is key) with time you two share with the step-sibs. If you really want you relationship with Calli to be \"practice\" for having your own kids, learning to adapt when things change without losing important bonds is a skill you will also need to practice. EDIT: Reading other responses after posting this made me rethink some things. It's true that you are not obligated to change anything about how things have been up to now. But it would be really great for everyone involved if you could at least be a little more flexible. Sorry if I was overly harsh at first, but I'll leave those comments as they are because I hope they offer a different perspective.", "Maybe controversial but YTA, you're favoring one of your cousins kids and not giving the others a chance.

They have their own set of family.", "NTA, your cousin needs to understand the relationship as it is. My daughter doesn't go with my step kids when their dads sister comes and gets them for a day at the pool, she understands that's their time. Now my family is weird and my sister and parents adopted my stepkids day one, and treat them as equals with my daughter, but they are direct relatives and most of the time, my wife and I are there. They have taken them all without is too. Now if they want to do something solo with my daughter, we plan for a weekend when the others aren't with us, as best we can. My daughter's moms parents don't take my steps out, they understand, and it's solely how everyone feels. Your cousin wants them all to have fun and be happy, but she cannot put that on you, if she cannot understand that, and keeps threatening your relationship with her daughter, she's the AH. I'd suggest trying to work around their parenting time to help alleviate the issue, and win, win, your cousin gets a free day with her spouse.", "Nta.

Not a whole day of activity but like an hour or two to start.", "Nta. I'm not about to tell my step daughter's uncle that my other kids get jealous when he gets her giant Lego sets, or her grandparents that they should take my kids to go back to school shopping when they take my step daughter(she lives with us full time ever since her mom moved across the country). The nature of blended families is that some kids have relationships with people that the other kids don't.

That would force their dad to spend his measly every other weekend with them and allow the 12 y/o to bond with her step siblings", "NTA.

You have a special bond with her and you should be able to maintain that with her on visits with just her. It sounds like the possibility might be there though that your cousin stops allowing you to take Calli if you don\u2019t include all of them. Maybe a compromise is in order. Take the step kids every third time and do something else that\u2019s not as costly and less dangerous when you take them. Like it or not, they are your step cousins now and will always be around so it might be helpful to include them some of the time, but definitely not all of the time just to help keep them from fighting or feeling left out. Blended families are hard enough without extra reasons for fighting. You might find that as you get to know them, you like them more. More importantly is the fact that their Dad should be doing things with them in the weekend while you take Callie out. Alternately, you can suggest that sometimes (not all the time) your all go out together, dad included, to do things as a group. That way he can pay for his own kids because you shouldn\u2019t have to do that.", "You didn't marry those kids' dad. They're not your responsibility, and you're not their free babysitter (which is what your cousin and/or her husband are really looking for).

She's required/should to look his kids as her own, and while family should except those kids at some point, you're right: you don't know those kids. You don't know how they act, what their interests are, if they could be taken anywhere and be safe, etc.\n\nIf your cousin is honestly concerned, the easiest thing to do would be for her to bring her step-kids and tag along. SHE can watch her new kids so you don't have to, but everyone can go to the same places and do the same activities.

By all means continue your adventures with Calli, it sounds like you guys have a lovely bond and she's lucky to have you. However, these other kids are now her siblings, and presumably will be part of her life for years and years to come. In the same vein they will be part of yours. You may not have a relationship with them currently but that's something that can be changed with just a little effort. They probably see Calli go off with her cool aunt and do all this fun stuff and probably feel a little left out and sad about it.

Until I know these kids, I will need you to be present and take the lead on these group outings. Regardless, it is still important for me to have 1-on-1 time with Calli, and I intend to continue to do that.

That is your choice, but the minute my brother and my nephew started dating women with children I always made sure to include those little girls someway.

Why else would the dad of those kids want them to tag along with the older kid on the weekends he has his kids that he only gets two days a week? This also means their festivities have to be safe for littles which means a lot has to change to accommodate them.

It's fine if OP wants to maintain a special bond with Callie, but the new family is trying to be a family and he should try to be more accepting of that.", "I am shocked by how cynical everyone can be here.

But I agree that OP doesn't have to change his special time with his niece and shouldn't feel obligated to babysit.

I\u2019m in a coparenting situation and it is so frustrating when other adults spoil the kids and  let them do stuff that we wouldn\u2019t allow. It undermines our rules and authority as parents. We decide what\u2019s best for the kids and are constantly trying to reprogram them from the influence they get from other adults.
