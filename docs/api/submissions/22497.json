There could be legit reasons someone can\u2019t/won\u2019t walk up, and if that\u2019s not clear in the order instructions, it\u2019s sort of a bait & switch.", "NAH, I think. But it would probably be a good idea to specify the lack of an elevator in your notes.\n\nNot every delivery person has enough time to walk up and down those stairs if they didn't expect it.", "i think NTA if you've given them instructions they can use and the furthest left door doesn't require them to park far from it.", "YTA. Walking up multiple flights of stairs is too much to ask from a delivery driver IMO. You can go down and get it in your pajamas.\n\nTo all those saying they don't have to take the order, at least on Doordash drivers don't see the instructions until AFTER they accept the job.", "Probably nta. Most delivery services I know, state delivery straight to your door, and as you've said in the post that you state the instructions straight away, then they're not fulfilling their job responsibilities by not coming to the door.", "Nta. You are doing delivery for your convenience - not to make things easier for the delivery person. That is why you are expected to pay them for their effort.", "NTA it\u2019s just part of the job", "NTA. You order your food to your address. \n\nYour address includes floor and apartment nr. If it\u2019s not delivered there, then it\u2019s not delivered. (My elderly frail gran lived on the third floor and we literally had to get the courts ruling on this to get her packages and food delivered.)", "YTA.\nTry looking at this from a different perspective. You don\u2019t want to get dressed, grab keys/money, take 3 flgihts downstairs to outside, travel and wait for your food, then travel home, climb 3 flights just to get into your apartment and finally eat, right? So you choose for someone else to do it, which is fine, but then don\u2019t tip because you\u2019re too lazy to do 3 flights of stairs for YOUR food?\n\nI\u2019m only on the second floor. 15 steps is what it takes to get to my door. I have physical disabilities. Not ONCE has a delivery driver ever had to come up. I ALWAYS meet them downstairs because, frankly, they are already doing me a huge favour by getting MY food and bringing it to me. The least I can do is tip enough for gas and meet them downstairs. \n\nTry being a delivery driver! Then you can see how much of an AH you\u2019re really being.", "YTA\n\nPut explicit instruction in the order directions stating 3rd floor walk up. It\u2019s possible that delivery people don\u2019t want to hoof up and down stairs for someone they don\u2019t know when they have other deliveries all within the same time slot. I guarantee I wouldn\u2019t want to goof up multiple flights, especially if I\u2019ve got other orders getting cold and possible parking issues.", "NTA You paid for a service and you have the right to expect what you've paid for. \n\nA TIP is for good service it's not free money.", "NTA - Delivery is delivery. You didn't force them to work in that scenario.\n\nAnd I've never heard of ordinary meal delivery leaving stuff \"somewhere\" - Is this a weird \"doordash/whatever\" special rule?", "YTA\n\nYou should still tip in the app at baseline (say 10%) and in your notes be clear that you are on third floor, there is no elevator, and that an additional cash tip is waiting if they bring it up. My guess is you \"tipping well\" is going to be the base 10-15% which is what you should tip in North America for 'standard' service, which in this case is bringing the food to the building. I'd consider climbing three flights of stairs superior service and think at least a 20% tip in that case. So if you're willing to tip 20-25%, then tip 10% of it in app and say you'll give the rest at door. Or just continue to be both cheap and lazy and expect workers to climb three flights of stairs you refuse to climb while offering substandard tips regardless.", "nta", "NTA...They're free to not accept the order if they don't want to follow the instructions.  You tip according to service, as it should be.", "NTA", "NTA. They are not doing their job and instead of complaining you simply dont tip them.", "NAH, tips aren\u2019t required and they have a right to refuse the order. I hope you live in an area with a lot of drivers tho, because I would not deliver to you a second time.", "Used to live on the fifth floor of an enclosed complex with gate and elevator code. I tipped because I knew I was asking them to go the extra mile. The whole point of getting delivery is so you don\u2019t have to leave your home. Only really had issues if they didn\u2019t speak English. Drivers are being paid a wage. Tip is extra. If they don\u2019t want to do extra work someone else will. NTA", "YTA if you live in a 3rd floor walk up with no elevator you should walk downstairs to get your food because sometimes people have disabilities and can't go up there flights or stairs also that's not their job .", "NTA  ... That's part of being a delivery driver.... to drop the delivery off AT THE DOOR unless it specifies otherwise.", "Nta there's a reward- tip- at the door\nDriver should complete the delivery\nAll these comments about not enough time... to what... do their job and get a tip?? OK then", "NTA but with this industry you\u2019re just yelling into the void.", "You're a piece of work. You don't have a disability; you live in a third floor walkup and hold the tip hostage. YTA", "Soft YTA for not including stairs in instructions. Also if the delivery person is a woman she might be hesitant to go inside a strange building. When I delivered pizza in a city back in the day I carried pepper spray when I went into apartments. Some people actually acted offended when they saw me.", "Yta. If you get food delivered often some steps won't hurt you.", "Bro just walk down the stairs to get your delivery and tip them a normal amount. Delivery drivers do not make very much money and have to do a ton of work to make anything worthwhile. They're already providing you with a service by bringing you food, and you don't tip them AT ALL if they don't walk up three flights of stairs? YTA.", "NTA that\u2019s part of the job.", "NTA. Delivering to the front door is the bare minimum of their job.", "YTA. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave my home\u201d. Mate, you\u2019re not leaving your building. It\u2019ll take you what, 2 minutes to walk to your lobby and collect and tip (which you should regardless, otherwise go collect your own damn food). It literally takes nothing but human decency to go meet them at the lobby door. People like you are some of the worst people.", "YTA", "NAH. This post on the Door Dash drivers sub would get absolutely tore apart. Frankly, the fact the driver doesn\u2019t know the tip or if you\u2019re actually going to give anything is a huge turn off for taking the order. As a former driver, I\u2019m definitely not taking a cash tip order. I agree they should follow the instructions, but the alternative is still you leaving and going to the restaurant yourself.", "NAH/SOFT YTA \n\nHowever, you need to understand that delivery people take a lot of time climbing up and down the stairs, even if it only takes 2 minutes. \n\nIf in one night, they had to climb 15 stairs, for all the clients that think the way you do, it would be 30 minutes lost and I doubt your tip makes up for the extra delivery/deliveries they could do in the same time frame\n\nETA: \n\nSource: I work for a restaurant and I'm the delivery manager", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
