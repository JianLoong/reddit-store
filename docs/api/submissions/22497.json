I tell her I'm sick in bed, which is why I ordered food. I ask if they are having trouble parking. No. I ask if she will give it to the valet to give to the front desk to perhaps bring up. No, to all of this. I must come down to the street to her car. She won't park because she has her small child in the car with her and can't get out of the car. At all. Period.   \n\n\nI did, in fact, get dressed and drag myself down to get the food from her car on the street. Discovered when I got upstairs that half my order was missing.

Hardly ANYONE tips cash these days   I have done pizza delivery since the 90s and Doordash, Ubereats  etc. since they started and if there's no tip on an order for the app services I don't take the order.  Most tips were cash until about 10 years ago.  Barely any are now.\n\nAn Ubereats driver recently did an experiment and posted on Tik Tok I think it was, in response to the \"But I tip cash and only after I get the service\" comments people always put.  He took all non tip orders all day and I think got one or two shitty cash tips the entire day.\n\nSo if you want your food brought up, tip ahead.  Not $2 either.  You may not like it, but that's how it goes.  Most deliveries pay $2-3 without a tip.  Just not worth it and anyone who takes the delivery is desperate or trying to hit some pathetic bonus like an extra dollar a trip if they accept everything.\n\nAlso, folks saying it's never delivered to their door, or it always is etc , depends on the apartment.  Some have no way to get in.  Some have no parking available.  I have had SO many customers get pissed off at certain apartments because I was not willing to park in the handicapped or fire zone (both $500 minimum fine IF you're lucky enough to not also get towed).

The ones who want me to illegally park or hang around to follow someone in are usually the worst tippers.\n\nIf you know there's nowhere good to park then you need to come down.

What does delivery mean? Does it mean pizza or Chinese food? Then fine. But if it means multiple heavy items, not so fine. Be explicit in details. Say you are in an apartment and how many floors. Some drivers may not be able to manage a heavy order and are able to cancel and pass the order on to another driver. I did grocery delivery for awhile, and once I had a customer get 5 cases of bottled water and multiple cases of soda. Fine if I\u2019m leaving it at a place with no or few stairs.

Like, you\u2019ve taken extra time to leave seamless directions and they try to play dumb. If you don\u2019t have to call me to deliver my food to me, I\u2019ll tip you more than what\u2019s posted. Of you lie to my face on the phone and I see that clearly when I have to then inconvenience myself to find you, I\u2019ll deduct from the tip. I think I\u2019ve only gotten upset with two deliveries ever, and both were that the driver claimed they couldn\u2019t find the door or it was locked when neither were true. They just didn\u2019t even try to fulfill directions of the delivery.\n\nI still remember one delivery driver who pulled up to the front gate when the dorections clearly stated what street my building was on with an addition address that was directly across the street to help alleviate confusion. So, she calls me and ask for the gate code. Well, our property manager doesn\u2019t give us a gate code. So, I tell her we do not have a gate code and there isn\u2019t any reason to enter the premise as the buildings door is on the outside of the building (not inside the gate). I verbally told her directions and offered for her to put in the address that\u2019s in the directions as it\u2019ll make sure she can see where I am talking about\u2026 Anyway, she cuts me off and sasses me and said that she only goes to the address given. So, I said, as mentioned, there isn\u2019t a gate code as management doesn\u2019t provide that to us. Although, the gate isn\u2019t around the entire building and you\u2019re more than welcome to walk into the premises and to my building to hand it to me (the gate is weird at that apartment- it\u2019s only for cars and not around the entire premise). She STFU at that point and delivered my food. Of course, I said it in the most polite voice I could just to piss them off more. Like, superb customer service voice. I\u2019m pretty sure I was even kind enough that day to meet the person at their car. I stopped doing that after that experience though. I called and complained to make sure she was never a driver for me again, too. She wasn\u2019t even the one to deliver it (hand it to me), it was her son. So. Rude. I think we all know this kind of woman (rude and thinks the other person just has to put up with them).", "NTA\n\nI noticed a difference in prices between the delivery menu and the restaurants menu sometimes.

Par for the course for a driver. If they have legit reasons they can\u2019t do it, that\u2019s up to them to cancel for or specify. \nAnyone spearheading a campaign for delivery drivers to not have to lift a finger is weird. I am paying for a service. If I could do it delivering sandwiches and pizzas in school I\u2019m sure a grown human can handle it after they clock out of their day job.", "NTA _*IF*_ you make the lack of elevators apparent. If not, total YTA. Not sure why people are getting so angry though..? It\u2019s their job and they\u2019re getting paid for it. Most times they can cancel the order after accepting it anyways. Also, I wouldn\u2019t call it lying when they say they\u2019re not allowed to go all the way up, since I find it very easy to believe that it\u2019s just the company\u2019s safety policies. Unless you know for sure(different person from the same business delivers it and the other doesn\u2019t), I wouldn\u2019t say stuff like that. Don\u2019t feel bad about ORDERING FOOD.

They don\u2019t get paid extra for the distance between the entrance, up the stairs to your apartment.  You owe them tips for delivering to your building entrance. You can offer extra to bring it up stairs to your door, but I wonder how much you\u2019re tipping. Delivery drivers want to move on to their next (paid) delivery instead of doing unpaid or underpaid work bringing it up stairs. \n\nAlso as someone who lives in an apartment, our apartment committee actually prefers it when drivers leave deliveries at the entrance, because it reduces the number of strangers wandering the private areas of the apartment complex.", "NTA...but I hope you are tipping them well.\n\nSpecifying a cash tip at the door might not be enough. You may want to say *how much* you will tip them for voluntarily walking up three flights of stairs.\n\nIf the policies state \"front door of the building\", you are asking them to go over and above the contracted task, so a generous tip should be a given.\n\nAnd such a tip should not be calculated by the percentage of total cost of the order--but as a standardized payment for adding time and energy to the delivery.\n\nPerhaps someone who does this job could better inform us what the minimum tip they would do this for should be (?)", "What if they physically can't make that walk?", "I've come to the conclusion that many DoorDash drivers simply don't read the instructions given.\n\nMy best friend had two toddlers.
