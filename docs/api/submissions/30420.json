Jade is my half sister and she's 6 weeks older than me - my dad cheated on my mum and we didn't find out until Jade was 9 but by then my parents had already been split up a number of years. She's been in my life 7 years now. \n\nJade has CF and is sick and she needs a lung transplant. I don't like Jade, she's self centred and rude. Esme wears hearing aids, Jade used to take great delight in hiding them from her. Esme and I no longer stay at dad's overnight because of Jade. If we had something she wanted, she'd take it and it didn't matter if it belonged to someone else. I received a pen from my stepgrandpa when he died, because I refused to let Jade have it she broke it. My dad promised me a party for my 16th (and why I thought he would actually do this is beyond me) but cancelled it the day before because Jade threw a massive tantrum over it. Her own party had been cancelled because she had been too ill. Dad told her that I would share, however Jade wanted her own party and if she couldn't have her own then she wanted mine cancelled. So dad cancelled because mum told him I didn't want to share with a spoilt brat. \n\nNow because Jade isnt well, she wants me to tutor her so that she doesn't fall behind. As we take the same subjects, Dad thinks this is a great idea even though we aren't at the same level as Jade is in the bottom set while I'm in top set for everything. I do some studying with Esme every so often but it's only occasionally when she's struggling to grasp something, also she asks and never demands. Jade also wants my tablet so that she can watch tv in bed as her laptop broke after it fell off her bed when she was asleep. I dont want my laptop to get broken nor do I have time (or the inclination) to tutor Jade. I have a part time job and baby sit my younger half siblings every other Friday night. Dad has told me to tell my mum to get a sitter and that I need to quit my job to help Jade. He expects me to be at Jade's beck and call. He tried to ground me because I wouldn't answer her texts one night. I had 42 texts in the space of an hour, I didn't answer because I was working. Jade expects everyone to cater to her because she's sick. Esme asked for a book for her birthday this year off dad. He bought it, wrapped it but ended up giving it to Jade when we visited when she was in hospital because she demanded he gave her the book as she was bored. \n\nDad's getting frustrated I won't help Jade and is calling me selfish and heartless. \nAITA for not giving my sick sister what she wants?\n\nEdit: I dont know if Jade's mum is around, I just know that social services were involved and that's why dad has custody of her. I dont know the ins and outs, I was 9.\nJade and I are 16. Esme is 14. Esme and I have both said if we are asked to donate then we will say no. We've both been tested for carrier status as mum wanted us to know for the future. I'm a carrier, Esme is not.

But that\u2019s just me. Why can\u2019t you go live with your mom instead?", "NTA. I don't think this is necessarily about the tutoring for your dad. It feels more like a haphazard, emotionally unintelligent attempt to force a bond where there isn't much of one. He likely harbors lingering guilt about cheating and now wants all his kids to be a happy family, but the only way he knows how to do that is through demands, punishments, and emotional brutality. You have no obligation to Jade. She is not entitled to your things. She's not entitled to your time. She's not entitled to your love or affection. If you want to give those things at some point, that choice has to be yours alone.", "Jesus wept. NTA. \n\nYour Father is the parent and the supposed Adult - it is not your responsibility to do his parenting job for him.\n\nI understand that he will feel desperately worried for her due to her illness but each of you girls deserve to have a decent life and I doubt that his allowing her to have whatever she wants is really doing her any good either, let alone that it also making yours and your sisters lives worse.\n\nWell done for you in setting some boundaries. It can be hard with family especially. As long as you are clear without being reckless or callous with other people's feelings, you have a right to stand up for yourself and your other sister.", "NTA.

It sounds like he plays favourits towards his affair child.", "NTA, She may have a horrible illness but using it to get her way constantly and hurting others, especially you. You're working your arse off and the last thing you need is to give in to the demands of a person who will take it all for granted. Hang in there OP", "NTA at all.  Your Dad is being unreasonable and selfish.  Jade is not your child and not your responsibility.  Jade may be your sister, but that in no way entitles her to demand anything from you. Your Dad has helped turn Jade into the brat that she is.  It's easier for your Dad to spoil Jade than to parent her.  Having an illness doesn't excuse bad behavior.", "NTA  \n\n\nmy heart goes out to you.  there are few more hurtful things then a parent sacrificing one child for another.  He should be ashamed of himself for allowing everyone else to suffer simply because Jade is sick.  I can understand wanting to give Jade the support but being so determined to make you miserable just to make Jade happy is disgusting.    \n\n\nThere are so many more options to get your sister the school help she wants without forcing you.  The thought of him forcing you basically pay for her to be tutored by you (because that is what he is demanding with making you quit your job) is not something a father should demand.  I would say at this point you would be better off if you and your Esma sister cut off contact with your dad if possible.  Something needs to wake him up to how he has been treating you.

I mean, not in those words but yea. She isn't your kid and is not your responsibility. If he throws a fit, demand full stop to be paid the same wage as your job, and more. Tutoring jobs are never cheap, and if they are, something is wrong. Your time is not cheap, make sure he understands at least this.", "NTA your father sure is!

It is sad that Jade is sick. It isn\u2019t her fault that she is the affair baby either. Some parents try to overcompensate for their child\u2019s illness by being too permissive. Your dad needs therapy to deal with his daughter\u2019s illness and potential death. Instead, he is trying to \u201cfix\u201d everything he can for her. This is unhealthy for both of them. \n\nYou sound young. Let your mom handle this for you for the most part. Tell dad you cannot help Jade because you are a kid trying to navigate your own life.

That's not me.  Have you spoken to the school?\"\n\nBut definitely don't tutor her, it's a trap.", "NTA. My son has CF, so I'm extremely familiar with what it entails. His didn't get caught until he was almost 1. I won't go into all the details, but suffice it to say that he hadn't gained weight/grown properly during that time and so he couldn't fight off infections properly and he almost died. He was in the hospital numerous times, and I had to quit my job to take care of him and he couldn't be around other kids so that he didn't get sick. Through the hard work of myself, the hospital staff, and his will to live, over the next year we managed to turn it all around and he was back on track in the middle of the growth charts and his body was able to fight off regular illness again. All that to say, that I can understand how your dad and her mom feel about the possibility of your sister dying in childhood to this disease. It is a **very real** possibility. \n\nBut you know what else is a very real possibility? That **she lives**. Maybe even for a long time. My son is in his early 20s in fact. And the doctors at his clinic said they had a guy who was actually in his 80s. When my son was born the average life expectancy for someone with CF was late 20s, then it changed to 30s, and I just googled it and it's now **50!** They've come up with lots of new treatments and preventative techniques and even gene therapy. And the lung transplants you mentioned are generally quite successful at adding many years to people's lives. \n\nSo when you find out your kid could die, many people take the stance of \"just give them everything they want to make them happy because they probably aren't going to be here very long\". Which basically means you don't teach them things that you'd teach a child you thought was going to live would need to know. Like how to not be a little sh!t f#ck. Like sharing and common courtesy and manners and how to do things for themselves and care about other people. Which if your kid only lives till 2 years old aren't problematic, but if your kid lives even till elementary school they end up tormenting every other person (both children and adults) that they come in contact with. And the older they get, the more torment they inflict, as you've learned first hand. \n\nI chose not to take that route, despite how close my son came to dying early on. I treated him the same as in most respects as I would have a child who wasn't chronically ill. I mean I didn't ignore his illness or anything, it was a very large part of our lives obviously, I just mean that he didn't get everything he wanted simply because he was chronically ill. He had to wait his turn and respect other people's belongings and space. He needed to treat others with kindness the same way he would want to be treated. You know, the regular stuff to teach kids not to be sh!tholes when they grow into adults. Because he might not have made it to adulthood, but what if he did and I hadn't prepared him properly. And it looks like I made the right call. \n\nYour dad and her mom did not. As much as it feels like this is your sister's fault for behaving this way, it is actually her parents fault for teaching her that this is how she should behave. She's still a child, and she probably doesn't have any role models for how chronically ill people are supposed to behave (spoiler alert, it's pretty similar to how non chronically ill people are supposed to behave), so all she has to go on is what her parents have allowed her to do and given her positive reinforcement for doing. She's just a kid who has to grow up with a thing that many adults have a hard time coping with and she wasn't provided by her parents with the appropriate support to handle this trauma in a better way. \n\nThis doesn't mean that you need to give her what she wants. And it doesn't mean that you should have to take abuse from her or anything like that either. You deserve better than to be sh!t on. I really just wanted to give you some other perspectives to think about. And maybe it will change the way you interact with her, like to not take her behavior personally and help you cope a little better when she's being particularly frustrating. Her parents are doing her a huge disservice. If you think it could be helpful for your dad to read my perspective please show him this. Of course, if he's just going to get angry and not care about outside opinions and then treat you poorly about it, then please don't show him. I'm sorry that you are having to deal with the fallout of their parenting decisions. And I hope for all of your sakes that they start to make better choices soon.", "Does your mum know about him expecting You to quit and mum get a sitter.

That he had been stable for a while, got a cold/flu that turned into pneumonia and passed away within 2 weeks. \n\nAlso, while waiting in the waiting room at the CF clinic one of the first times we went this adorable little 8 or 9 year old comes out from her appointment pushing her oxygen tank in a wheelchair. While her mom was a few feet away scheduling more appointments she started chatting with me about how she was so excited about going to Disney for Make A Wish. At that time CF kids only qualified for Make A Wish if their lung function was so bad that they were basically on death's door. I never saw her again and I really hope she had a great trip. She likely didn't live another year after that. But I've thought about her a lot over the past 20 years. Especially the multiple times my son was hospitalized and the 5 surgeries he had before he was even 5 years old and how he was close to death on more than one occasion, even in his first year of life. So I'm very very aware that just because the average age is increasing does not mean that everyone will get to live that long.", "This is 100% the way and I really hope OP sees this because it\u2019s some of the best advice in this thread.", "Honestly no idea if this is possible, as I am not the techiest person, but can a certain number be automatically forwarded to another phone, so all calls from him go to your Mom's phone?\n\nOP is NTA, I'd personally go for formal full custody so Dad has to pay 'full' child support, since he's absolutely going to financially ghost the second the courts allow it...but I'm, shall we say...petty.", "You can't possibly be this monomaniacal", "well we see where she gets her entitled behavior from", "Nah more like rabbit poop", ">At least this is true in the US, and probably most other major Western countries.\n\nAbsolutely true. In Canada, we have medical autonomy from age 14. Meaning we can make decisions about our own medical treatments once we are age 14, and that includes choosing to have an abortion, choosing to donate organs, and maintaining our medical privacy.\n\nOP mentioned \u00a3 in another comment, so it sounds like they're in the UK, and anyone 16+ has medical autonomy as well as anyone under 16 who demonstrates that they have enough intelligence, competence and understanding to appreciate what is involved in their medical needs, called being Gillick competent. And it certainly sounds from this post, that both OP and Esme would qualify as competent to appreciate their own medical needs.", "OP already has been tested and is a match.", "Or emotions.", "Also, what if he says yes, OP quits the job and Dad decides not to pay her.

What\u2019s stopping you from never seeing your dad or Jade again?", "I love your mom! \n\nShe is protecting you from that train wreck going on at your dads place! \n\nYou are at an age (I believe) where you no longer have to spend time with your dad if you don\u2019t want to. \n\nAll he does is try to use you and Esme and try to force you to interact with a spoiled brat that needs boundaries and discipline for her actions. \n\nI think your father needs some discipline and boundaries too! \n\nHaving a Chronic Disease does not give you a hall pass to treat everyone like they owe you something. That\u2019s not how the world works. \n\nIf you want to act that way you can, free will and all, however you will end up alone and miserable. \n\nYour dad needs to grow a pair and deal with his daughter. \n\nThey both could probably benefit from therapy.( I am not a therapist) \n\nMe, I would go NC with him.

She should also tell you that you\u2019ve got the right to block abusive communication. Even if it\u2019s your dad. Can you ask her about full official custody? I think this is worth going to court over.", "I\u2019m so glad to hear this. Stay with her as much as possible.\nSince you have mentioned half siblings, I assume your mom moved on and is doing better?", "Quick question- you say she's waiting for a lung transplant and you say you've both been asked if you would donate and both said no. I may be misunderstanding here, but are they asking you if you would donate an actual lung? I'm not sure where you are but I don't even think that's a thing here. You can't just like, remove a healthy lung from someone and have them just walking around with 1 lung. Correct me if I'm wrong someone please, but aren't donor lungs from organ donations at the donor's time of death?", "I would answer every single he says with \u201cLOL. no.\u201d \n\nGround the kids!
