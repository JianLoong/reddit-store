But that\u2019s just me. Why can\u2019t you go live with your mom instead?", "NTA. I don't think this is necessarily about the tutoring for your dad. It feels more like a haphazard, emotionally unintelligent attempt to force a bond where there isn't much of one. He likely harbors lingering guilt about cheating and now wants all his kids to be a happy family, but the only way he knows how to do that is through demands, punishments, and emotional brutality. You have no obligation to Jade. She is not entitled to your things. She's not entitled to your time. She's not entitled to your love or affection. If you want to give those things at some point, that choice has to be yours alone.", "Jesus wept. NTA. \n\nYour Father is the parent and the supposed Adult - it is not your responsibility to do his parenting job for him.\n\nI understand that he will feel desperately worried for her due to her illness but each of you girls deserve to have a decent life and I doubt that his allowing her to have whatever she wants is really doing her any good either, let alone that it also making yours and your sisters lives worse.\n\nWell done for you in setting some boundaries. It can be hard with family especially. As long as you are clear without being reckless or callous with other people's feelings, you have a right to stand up for yourself and your other sister.", "NTA. I wouldn'T want to spend any time with this spoilt brat either.\n\nINFO: Do you have to visit your father or do you want it? It sounds like he plays favourits towards his affair child.", "NTA, She may have a horrible illness but using it to get her way constantly and hurting others, especially you. You're working your arse off and the last thing you need is to give in to the demands of a person who will take it all for granted. Hang in there OP", "NTA at all.  Your Dad is being unreasonable and selfish.  Jade is not your child and not your responsibility.  Jade may be your sister, but that in no way entitles her to demand anything from you. Your Dad has helped turn Jade into the brat that she is.  It's easier for your Dad to spoil Jade than to parent her.  Having an illness doesn't excuse bad behavior.", "NTA  \n\n\nmy heart goes out to you.  there are few more hurtful things then a parent sacrificing one child for another.  He should be ashamed of himself for allowing everyone else to suffer simply because Jade is sick.  I can understand wanting to give Jade the support but being so determined to make you miserable just to make Jade happy is disgusting.    \n\n\nThere are so many more options to get your sister the school help she wants without forcing you.  The thought of him forcing you basically pay for her to be tutored by you (because that is what he is demanding with making you quit your job) is not something a father should demand.  I would say at this point you would be better off if you and your Esma sister cut off contact with your dad if possible.  Something needs to wake him up to how he has been treating you.  I would recommend starting a journal off all the things your dad does and says now so that in the future you can have it as evidence for how badly hes been treating you in the future (include dates and times)", "Where is your mom in all this?

I mean, not in those words but yea. She isn't your kid and is not your responsibility. If he throws a fit, demand full stop to be paid the same wage as your job, and more. Tutoring jobs are never cheap, and if they are, something is wrong. Your time is not cheap, make sure he understands at least this.", "NTA your father sure is!

From the sound of it you owe neither of them any favours.", "NTA", "NTA stand your ground", "NTA Your dad is frankly failing you, I would tell him that you won\u2019t any tutoring for him nor give Jade any of your belongings, it\u2019s good you live with your mother.

And your father is a bad parent. Don't bring anything to his house that you aren't willing to lose. Do not quit your job and do not tutor Jade. Your father can hire a tutor for her, the same way he expected your mother to hire a sitter. You are not his to loan out, especially when he has made it very clear that you aren't anywhere near as important as Jade is.", "42 texts in an hour would make me dig in on not helping. It is sad that Jade is sick. It isn\u2019t her fault that she is the affair baby either. Some parents try to overcompensate for their child\u2019s illness by being too permissive. Your dad needs therapy to deal with his daughter\u2019s illness and potential death. Instead, he is trying to \u201cfix\u201d everything he can for her. This is unhealthy for both of them. \n\nYou sound young. Let your mom handle this for you for the most part. Tell dad you cannot help Jade because you are a kid trying to navigate your own life. Jade only wants you around when she wants something. Some siblings are not close. He is going to have to face reality at some point.", "Ask your dad if he would accept a relationship with you that doesn\u2019t include Jade.

That's not me.  Have you spoken to the school?\"\n\nBut definitely don't tutor her, it's a trap.", "NTA. My son has CF, so I'm extremely familiar with what it entails. His didn't get caught until he was almost 1. I won't go into all the details, but suffice it to say that he hadn't gained weight/grown properly during that time and so he couldn't fight off infections properly and he almost died. He was in the hospital numerous times, and I had to quit my job to take care of him and he couldn't be around other kids so that he didn't get sick. Through the hard work of myself, the hospital staff, and his will to live, over the next year we managed to turn it all around and he was back on track in the middle of the growth charts and his body was able to fight off regular illness again. All that to say, that I can understand how your dad and her mom feel about the possibility of your sister dying in childhood to this disease. It is a **very real** possibility. \n\nBut you know what else is a very real possibility? That **she lives**. Maybe even for a long time. My son is in his early 20s in fact. And the doctors at his clinic said they had a guy who was actually in his 80s. When my son was born the average life expectancy for someone with CF was late 20s, then it changed to 30s, and I just googled it and it's now **50!** They've come up with lots of new treatments and preventative techniques and even gene therapy. And the lung transplants you mentioned are generally quite successful at adding many years to people's lives. \n\nSo when you find out your kid could die, many people take the stance of \"just give them everything they want to make them happy because they probably aren't going to be here very long\". Which basically means you don't teach them things that you'd teach a child you thought was going to live would need to know. Like how to not be a little sh!t f#ck. Like sharing and common courtesy and manners and how to do things for themselves and care about other people. Which if your kid only lives till 2 years old aren't problematic, but if your kid lives even till elementary school they end up tormenting every other person (both children and adults) that they come in contact with. And the older they get, the more torment they inflict, as you've learned first hand. \n\nI chose not to take that route, despite how close my son came to dying early on. I treated him the same as in most respects as I would have a child who wasn't chronically ill. I mean I didn't ignore his illness or anything, it was a very large part of our lives obviously, I just mean that he didn't get everything he wanted simply because he was chronically ill. He had to wait his turn and respect other people's belongings and space. He needed to treat others with kindness the same way he would want to be treated. You know, the regular stuff to teach kids not to be sh!tholes when they grow into adults. Because he might not have made it to adulthood, but what if he did and I hadn't prepared him properly. And it looks like I made the right call. \n\nYour dad and her mom did not. As much as it feels like this is your sister's fault for behaving this way, it is actually her parents fault for teaching her that this is how she should behave. She's still a child, and she probably doesn't have any role models for how chronically ill people are supposed to behave (spoiler alert, it's pretty similar to how non chronically ill people are supposed to behave), so all she has to go on is what her parents have allowed her to do and given her positive reinforcement for doing. She's just a kid who has to grow up with a thing that many adults have a hard time coping with and she wasn't provided by her parents with the appropriate support to handle this trauma in a better way. \n\nThis doesn't mean that you need to give her what she wants. And it doesn't mean that you should have to take abuse from her or anything like that either. You deserve better than to be sh!t on. I really just wanted to give you some other perspectives to think about. And maybe it will change the way you interact with her, like to not take her behavior personally and help you cope a little better when she's being particularly frustrating. Her parents are doing her a huge disservice. If you think it could be helpful for your dad to read my perspective please show him this. Of course, if he's just going to get angry and not care about outside opinions and then treat you poorly about it, then please don't show him. I'm sorry that you are having to deal with the fallout of their parenting decisions. And I hope for all of your sakes that they start to make better choices soon.", "Does your mum know about him expecting You to quit and mum get a sitter.
