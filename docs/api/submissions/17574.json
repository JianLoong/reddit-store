He also LOVES to screech. I love my baby but taking him for a 4-6 hour seminar sounds like my worst nightmare. Not to mention if he\u2019s \u201cwatching\u201d the seminar, chances are he\u2019s going to want mama as soon as he sees her face/hears her voice!", "I don't even remember anything from when I was three!", "I dunno, I was unfortunate enough to meet someone once who played \"aspirational\" youtube grifter videos to their baby to promote a certain mindset. Those videos where the person is like \"would you rather have ten million dollars or one cucumber seed? I'd take the cucumber seed because in ten years I'll have 11 million cucumbers, which I can sell for one dollar each\".\n\nMaybe the OP's sister is trying to indoctrinate the baby lol.", "Is she qualified to even be giving a seminar like this? Yikes!", "Exactly. What planet is this mother living on where she thinks a 9 month old is going to sit quietly & listen with rapt attention for 4 to 6 HOURS?", " It sounds like she get's quite a bit of money out of this.", "Further down someone suggested that the mom is probably banking on being about to show off as a working mom and that\u2019s the only thing I can think of. I don\u2019t get it, because if I went to a seminar and someone pointed out how that\u2019s their baby in the back and aren\u2019t they so lucky to be so successful that they can be with their baby all the time, I would think they\u2019re nuts. It\u2019s like the mlm people who say they work on vacation, in the hospital, etc because their job is so awesome that they can dO iT aNyWhErE. That\u2019s not the flex you think it is, sis.", "You are NTA on the face of it, but this context makes that very clear. This situation with your sister and her abusive partner sounds like a nightmare. While it\u2019s important to maintain connection, especially for the sake of your nephew, given the issues that your parents enabling her have caused, it\u2019s totally reasonable for you to set and maintain boundaries. You are in a very difficult situation, having to thread a needle of maintaining connection while setting reasonable boundaries. Good luck.", "Why would she want a 9 month old to see a freaking seminar?  He's not going to know what's going on.  How silly.  Does she really think a 9 month old baby is going to be all \"Wow Mom is amazing running this seminar!\" or something?  \n\nIt's very strange the father doesn't allow visitors.  He won't even allow the kids Aunt to stop by?  That's just weird as hell.  Your sister is just ok with this?  You have to go all the way to your parents just to see your nephew......it's so odd.\n\nNTA", "NTA she\u2019s trying to manipulate you to do what she wants. Listen to your mom and go live your life. Maybe get some therapy so you can start spotting her negative bahaviour", "NTA that does not sound like the appropriate setting for a nine month old, he\u2019s not gonna care one bit about any of it, and will likely end up being more of a distraction for her than anything. You were willing to watch him at home, if she can\u2019t agree to the terms, she can find someone else.", "NTA. That's ridiculous! Nuf said.", "NTA.  Your sister is entitled. She can find her own sitter and pay them.", "NTA had to scroll back up to confirmthe age NINEMONTHS! lol get a grip sis", "NTA.\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of irony in her behavior and the content in her seminar\u2026", "And in applying the introspection exercises to develop awareness on how poorly she is treating her sister. This is OPs first invitation to the seminar itself.  But infant will certainly benefit from it! /s. And now it is OK for OP to go. As a babysitter. OP is NTA.", "Just curious:  if you were there with the baby, do you think she might try to charge you for attending?\n\nShe\u2019s being unreasonable; I\u2019m just curious how unreasonable she might be\u2026", "A first time mother who doesn\u2019t get babies have the attention span of a walnut. I\u2019m a nanny and my god infants involve sooo much bouncing from one activity to the next. She\u2019s crazy to want to bring an infant\u2026WHO WILL GET FUSSY\u2026to a seminar that will involve loads of talking. NTA OP tell her from a nanny with 13 years experience that it will only be disruptive to bring a nine month old and should be left home.", "Oh yeah, that\u2019s COMPLETELY what this is about. Never mind that the baby will have a meltdown from boredom. She\u2019s being ridiculous", "NTA, and post this to r/choosingbeggars.  Your sister is way out of line.", "NTA - she needs you more than you need her. Don\u2019t go to the seminar with her, if you are going to watch your nephew do it on your terms.", "Your sister is short sighted. He's 9 months old. Nta", "NTA. Go live your life. The baby is not going to know anything about the seminar so her wanting him to see it is either a BS excuse or she\u2019s crazy. Tell her you\u2019ll watch him on your terms not hers. Also don\u2019t let her guilt trip you.", "NTA.  New momma needs to get her childcare in order. There's a big difference between an occasional  play date and being her reliable, free sitter.    She's making money - she can figure this out.   Dont fall for this manipulation", "But she gets to attend the $200 conference for free!

Ghosting you after voicing concern? Manipulating you into thinking you\u2019re a bad aunt for not wanting to do something kinda unreasonable (why would an infant need to be at a day long seminar?!). These don\u2019t sound like behaviors from an emotionally mature person. She sounds a bit abusive, imo", "Her partner should be taking care of his son.", "Sounds like your sister needs to meditate on how manipulative and selfish she's being.\n\nDon't feel guilty, it was generous of you to even offer care and help!

I'd take the cucumber seed because in ten years I'll have 11 million cucumbers, which I can sell for one dollar each\".\n\nI wish someone would make me that offer. They aren't considering the time and expense it would take to grow those cucumbers plus the bother and expense of trying to market them before they rot. Of course, that's assuming that the original seed is perfectly planted and grows well.  By the time you are done growing those 11 million cucumbers, you will detest them. \n\nMeanwhile anyone who picked the cash could have invested it and grown richer without all the effort. You could pay one of the millions to a money management company and waited for the dividends to be deposited in your bank. \n\nAlso, you could have taken 5 dollars from it and bought multiple packs of cucumber seeds, hired a team to grow them for you, and dominated the market while the other guy was still growing his further seeds from the one he had.", "A better question seems to be is she qualified to be parenting since she seems to think it\u2019s appropriate to have a baby there.", "NTA. If she wants you to babysit you need to do it where you're comfortable not having baby on show."]}
