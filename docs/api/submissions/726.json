I have not yet seen him interact with other dogs due to this.\nI tend to walk him at night around 9 or 10 pm as there\u2019s usually no one outside at this time, so I don\u2019t have to try to dodge all the other dogs being walked in the neighborhood. \n\nMy dog was on a leash, we were walking at a brisk pace and as we turned a corner, to my surprise we nearly ran into another couple walking their small chihuahua-like dog. My dog LUNGED for their dog with a speed and ferocity that caught me off guard, the leash slipped from my hands and my dog attacked their dog. My dog is a good sized boxer/lab mix (although he could just be a pitbull mix and the rescue listed him as a boxer/lab to help with his adoption chances) and I feared he would legitimately kill the other dog. It was awful, we were all screaming, I managed to grab the leash and drag my dog away but some damage had definitely been done. \nI exchanged contact info with the owners and they rushed him to the ER. I originally wanted to do the right thing and help pay for medical bills. I live in a high COL area and I figured it would be expensive, but they let me know the estimated cost to save their dog is at nearly twenty thousand dollars so far. And it could potentially increase.\n\nI did not believe them at first, but they forwarded the estimate bill to me and offered to bring me to the hospital to see for myself. The price quote is real. The dog has broken ribs and is oxygen dependent, they want to give him at least one blood transfusion and hospitalise for several days. \n\nThere is no world in which I can afford that. That\u2019s ridiculous. I said I would pay for euthanasia or contribute 5k towards the bill. They argued with me saying it is my fault, which is true, but that amount is outlandish.

Yes you said you take measures to avoid other dogs, but as you have to walk him, whether it\u2019s late at night or not, there is still a chance of encountering other dogs.

You could have got the dog a muzzle and walked him anytime of the day so your excuses are pathetic.

And your homeowners/renters insurance is going to go up, especially if they sue you for the full cost of the bill.\n\nYou should consult a lawyer however, to see what you're liable for.", "YTA but I would get a lawyer and probably put your dog down before he attacks a human and the judge does it for you.", "YTA I would love to be a fly on the wall when you're in court telling the magistrate it's your fault the dog got mauled but you \"would pay for euthanasia or contribute 5k towards the bill\" because it would dip into your savings and you live in a high cost of living area.", "YTA.  You're also contradicting yourself, which makes me suspect you're not telling the truth about everything else you've said.  You admit you have savings to pay the damages. Thus you CAN absolutely afford that, you just don't WANT to.  That's enough for my YTA vote right there.\n\nLuckily for the victim of your negligence, the legal system does not allow the perpetrator of an assault to determine what is \"outlandish.\"  That's the judge's job.  If you fail to pay this will go to court, and you will almost certainly lose unless their lawyer is completely incompetent.  Based on the facts presented, this is about as open and shut as these cases go.\n\nIf you think 20k is expensive, wait until you lose the lawsuit and get hit with legal fees and punitive damages.  Based on my experiences working in a law firm, I would estimate that in my jurisdiction the eventual judgement would be between double and triple that number.\n\nIf you were smart, you'd pay the money before it goes to court and consider it a life lesson.    Somehow, I doubt you'll take that advice.", "YTA. As the owner of an aggressive dog, this is 100% your responsibility. You don't get to decide that they have to put their dog down because yours attacked it.\n\nI imagine you'll pay one way or another. You've already traumatized them enough. Don't make them take you to small claims court.", "I recommend that you speak with a lawyer.  There is likely to be legal action where bills will be this large.", "YTA!! How dare you tell them that you would pay for euthanasia. I hope they take you to small claims court.", "Do you have home insurance or renters insurance and let the insurance know you have a dog? The insurance will cover the cost of attacks by your dog. Well at least the first one. If you don't have it, well that is an easy case for them to win in court plus lawyer fees and possibly get your dog put down. When you took in this dog knowing it hates other dogs, you took on that responsibility of having to payout when it attacks someone. YTA", "YTA. File a claim with your homeowners or renters insurance or they will most likely sue your insurance anyway.", "YTA. It's your dog and your responsibility whatever the outcome. I have an abused reactive shelter dog that is dog-aggressive, she's never bitten before but she has to be muzzled for walks just in case, and I do so because I'm a responsible dog owner. If they sue you they will win, and then you'll be out the legal fees on top of the veterinary bills.", "YTA. Your dog, your responsibility.", "No clue why people walk boxers without the mouth protection, its a an accident waiting to happen", "Dog reactive dogs are 99% of the time not human reactive dogs. \n\nHe still needs to pay.", "Yup, came here to say that. They will sue and win. Especially since they have already admitted fault.", "This. OP, your dog could be *euthanized* for what happened. The best things to do would be to pay the bill and hire a certified animal behaviorist *stat*.", "It doesn\u2019t matter though. Ignoring the fact it\u2019s a living being for a second (so worth more emotionally) ,if somebody damages somebodies property then they have to pay for it. They can\u2019t say \u201cwell what I damaged is crazily priced so I won\u2019t pay it all\u201d.", "who are you to put value on someone else\u2019s pet?", "Yeah I\u2019m shocked everyone is just dismissing the $20,000 like it\u2019s chump change. \n\nI LOVE dogs. I spent $3500 to save my beagle, but 20 grand!?!?!? \n\nOp makes no argument that they are not at fault. But there is also the reality of the cost of surgery. Which may not even be successful. \n\nAnd for those saying that op may get taken to court, no judge or jury is going to award someone 20 grand for an accident involving their dog.", "He will pay the 20k, legal fees and probably distress compensation.\n\nOP you need a liability insurance for your dog and yes, you have to pay the bill. It's your fault because it's your dog.", "They MIGHT sue Op. Suing someone cost a lot of time and money..... Even when you are 100% in the right.", "Honestly, in most jurisdictions, OP's dog will be confiscated and likely euthanized.", "While true, the shitty thing with our system is animals are consider material. Like your car or house. I do not like that at all. It means someone can go an kill your animal, and you aren't allowed to retaliate in the situation because you would be harming another individual etc.", "Or at least take frigging precautionary measures. Muzzle it. Aggressive dogs in most areas are required to be muzzled in public. Get a leash that you can tighten on your hand so you can't drop it. There's plenty of things to do other than shrug and go 'euthanize your beloved pet, I guess'.", "> No one can afford 20k to save a dog\n\nOP admitted that they can", "What do you mean NAH? He took his aggressive dog he knew doesn't get along with others and didn't control  it.\n\nEmergency means more money, yes. His dog and his inefficiency in controlling his dog caused it. Maybe you want your dog put down cos you can't afford a life saving surgery but those people deserve to have their dog saved and op is responsible.\n\nThey should sue him.", "People who truly love their pets will do anything to save them. My last dog's vet bills amounted to more than twice that and did it put me out of my savings? Yes. Was I more bothered about my dog's life than my savings? Also yes. I've made that money back twice over since then and I also didn't have to live with the guilt of allowing my dog to die unnecessarily, win win.\n\nIt doesn't even matter what it costs anyway, because without OP the owners of the other dog wouldn't be in this situation. Why should they be concerned with the finances of a stranger who almost caused the death of their dog over their own pet?", "A dog aggressive dog is not always a threat to humans", "How is it sad for OP? They're just pissed off that don't have to pay. Disgusting behaviour with no remorse at all", "I really hope they sue", "I mean this is absolutely certain.  If she/he/they doesn't pay, they will sue for the damages plus whatever else they can, including pain and suffering.  For the record, I would sue them into the ground if I had to watch my pet almost die", "I agree that he should pay but, he's only had the dog a few months. He may be doing training but, that takes some time.", "If an animal is oxygen dependent to maintain life, what quality of life is that for the animal? \nNo chance I\u2019d support any of my friends/family in keeping the animal alive and there\u2019s no chance my animals would have to go through that. Dead animals don\u2019t suffer. \n\nI\u2019m surprised there\u2019s not an insurance that could potentially cover? I have liability insurance for my horse in case he smashes anything/injures someone on accident. \n\nAlso, when my previous horse got kicked in the field with open wound directly into the joint space - she had surgery, stayed in a horse hospital for a week and a half. Cost a total of \u00a32000. No way in hell I\u2019d pay 20k for a dog to be put through medical hell just for the principle of let\u2019s not talk about putting it down. If the bill is 20k, that dog is better off dead than suffering that amount of injury.", "I really don't understand this concern with 20k being a lot of money. Where is the concern for the the people who would've had to pay *no money*, not a single penny, if this hadn't happened? Should they cough up 15k for something someone else did?", "But OP can afford it, he even said so in the post.\n\n>It would technically not put me into debt, but it would make a serious dent in my savings. It is a about a fourth of my yearly take home pay after taxes.", "This is correct. Homeowners insurance usually covers these instances even if it occurs off premise. However, you\u2019re insurance may require you get rid of your dog or they\u2019ll drop you after they settle. Once the couple calms down and gets past the trauma of what is happening I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll file a report and start to gain recommendations from people close to them on how to move forward. You can\u2019t just dodge responsibility of a dog you own mauling another animal. It\u2019s also not your choice to decide that the damage your animal caused is too expensive- and euthanizing would be more favorable and beneficial to YOU. You\u2019re selfish and YTA.", "I didn't say don't pay at all. I think it's good that he's offering $5k", "It\u2019s gonna cost a lot less than those vet bills.", "It doesn\u2019t always cost a lot of money. This kind of case would probably be against OP\u2019s homeowner insurance since the dog would be considered personal property. Cases like that are regularly done on a \u201cwe take a percentage of the final settlement\u201d basis. OP\u2019s homeowner insurance will definitely go up", "Terribly sad that the dog is likely to face more consequences than the owner. If it had gone to someone with half a brain it'd have been well trained and muzzled and this situation would never have happened.", "Expecting someone to pay 20k for a vet bill is idiotic. No one has that kind of money laying around. If you do more power to you. OP offered them 5k, which is the max you can get in small claims court. \n\nAnd if you actually read my post you will see that I said they are responsible and they could easily get sued and would have to pay. But can you honestly say that you would fork over 20k right now to pay for someone else's dog without trying to negotiate it down? If you say yes, you're just a liar.\n\nAnd yes if it was going to cost 20k+ to fix my dog, I would put them down.", "Sure but that's worth mentioning. You don't just adopt a reactive dog and assume everything's going to be hunky-dory if you just walk them late enough...", "if OP is doing training then they shouldn't be taking the dog out when they are clearly not ready- but im gonna guess they aren't because there was no mention of it", "Yeh, I\u2019m saying it doesn\u2019t work like that. If you destroyed someone\u2019s car for example, you can\u2019t just offer to pay a smaller amount than what the car is worth/ it will cost to fix it because it costs a lot of money. You can\u2019t say, \u201cwell I wrecked your car, it\u2019s my fault, but the estimate is more than I want to pay so here\u2019s 1/4 of it\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWhy should the owners be out of pocket because his dog mauled theirs?!", "not really... about 15k to start. Plus it takes like 2 years before you are going to see any money. You are not garaunteed your legal cost will be covered either", "IF his homeowners insurance covers it.  \n\nIve been on both sides of a lawsuit. The thing it taught me. You dont ever want to be on either side of a lawsuit.\n\nAnd justice is never garaunteed.", "Yep. Well, the training might not have been possible (training can only do so much, especially if he's only had the dog for a few months) but it absolutely should have been muzzled. I don't think OP was in the wrong to take the dog for a walk, but he KNEW it was dog-aggressive and didn't take that one very simple step that would have protected the other dog from the worst of its injuries.", "What's idiotic is taking an aggressive dog out and not controlling it.\n\nNot the other dogs owners problem , it's op's problem.\n\nRightly so. And he offered them money to put their dog down. No, fuck that, his dog caused it so pay up, they don't want to put their dog to sleep because someone is an irresponsible dog owner.", "Where are you getting these numbers from?", "I dont disagree with the OP being irresponsible and should have control of the dog and shouldn't have an agressive dog. I dont disagree that the OP is responsible for the damages. \n\nI just disagree that they are an AH for \"only offering 5k instead of 20k.\" Because if it costs 20k for the emergency vet to \"fix\" the dog they will come back and start asking for more because there WILL be complications and that dog will probably lead a horrible life. Is OP responsible for every future vet bill? Most future issues could likely be tied back to this incident. Where do you draw the line? \n\nMost importantly, what is best for the dog? Not the people, but the dog.", "The dog can be saved, the op just needs to pay up."]}
