We have 3 children together, twins ages 11, and a 9 year old. My husband has a son14 with Down syndrome and many heart problems. He needs extra attention which we cannot give. He needs extra financial care, which we do not have. He has insurance but it does not cover it all.\n\nHe has been living with his mother, but his mother was just in a car crash. He\u2019s been staying with us for a few days, but his mothers recovery is a long process. It could take up to 8 months- to a year or even longer. She\u2019s had multiple surgeries and her legs were badly damaged, so she\u2019d have to go through physical therapy and may even be placed in a rehab unit after she is released from the hospital. She has asked my husband if we could take care of him for the time being.\n\nMy stepsons maternal grandparents have also offered to help out and take him sometimes during the week or on the weekends. The issue is we both work 6 days out of the week. My husband is the only one with a great paying job, so we get by, we\u2019re comfortable, but adding another child onto that, with expensive health issues, puts us out of that zone. Along with getting utilities paid, and food. A few months ago we had a great financial downfall and lost a lot of money, had to even dig into savings, so this was a reasonable concern.\n\nWhen I brought this up to my husband he was outraged. He said we couldn\u2019t abandon his son, and that I should look for a different job, one to pay better. When I pointed out that we wouldn\u2019t have the time (which he needs alot of attention) my husband pointed out us getting a sitter, which is also something we cannot afford. He won\u2019t take no for an answer and is very upset that I am against it. He said I\u2019m treating his son indifferent, and that I should be supporting him. I love my stepson, but I\u2019m just stating the facts.", "created_utc": 1677186910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a8yxa/aita_for_telling_my_husband_we_cannot_afford_to/", "score": 4116, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", "Your concerns are valid but if this was one of your children instead of a stepchild this wouldn\u2019t even be a question.\n\nYou married a man with a disabled son.

Pick out YOUR least favorite kid or 2 and send them to live with your parents or other relatives. That will free up space in your house and money. Then your husband can bring his oldest child to live in his house. That seems fair because he hasn\u2019t had the responsibility of caring for him so if you can only afford some of your kids, it\u2019s his turn.

Seriously all the Y T A comments are knee jerk reactions of \u201chow can you be so heartless\u201d when that\u2019s not it all all. You being up totally valid concerns that in taking on this child it puts the rest of your family in jeopardy financially. Voicing those concerns doesn\u2019t make you an AH. Your husband isn\u2019t wrong to be upset either. Any parent would be upset over anybody even suggesting that they can\u2019t care for their kid. I think it\u2019s time to sit down and have a rational discussion about this. If he\u2019s paying child support it needs to be withdrawn the moment the child comes to you (because logically even if you can\u2019t afford it, you know it\u2019s most likely that it\u2019s happening). BM can figure her bills out herself. If she doesn\u2019t have the child the she doesn\u2019t get the child\u2019s money. Also, work out a schedule with the grandparents to help with his care. Does the mom do it all alone or does she have help? Can you all get the same help? Are there any before/after care programs? You husband is kind of being AHish though with the whole \u201cyou go get a better job\u201d comment. Maybe he should get a second job to support his kid. It\u2019s not your fault or your job to handle this situation (including getting a new job or more childcare for his child).", "YTA. Suck it up.

And I\u2019m having trouble understanding why this would be such a terrible increase in financial burden, unless of course you and your husband have not been contributing enough finally this far.

We have 3 children together, twins ages 11, and a 9 year old. My husband has a son14 with Down syndrome and many heart problems. He needs extra attention which we cannot give. He needs extra financial care, which we do not have. He has insurance but it does not cover it all.\n\nHe has been living with his mother, but his mother was just in a car crash. He\u2019s been staying with us for a few days, but his mothers recovery is a long process. It could take up to 8 months- to a year or even longer. She\u2019s had multiple surgeries and her legs were badly damaged, so she\u2019d have to go through physical therapy and may even be placed in a rehab unit after she is released from the hospital. She has asked my husband if we could take care of him for the time being.\n\nMy stepsons maternal grandparents have also offered to help out and take him sometimes during the week or on the weekends. The issue is we both work 6 days out of the week. My husband is the only one with a great paying job, so we get by, we\u2019re comfortable, but adding another child onto that, with expensive health issues, puts us out of that zone. Along with getting utilities paid, and food. A few months ago we had a great financial downfall and lost a lot of money, had to even dig into savings, so this was a reasonable concern.\n\nWhen I brought this up to my husband he was outraged. He said we couldn\u2019t abandon his son, and that I should look for a different job, one to pay better. When I pointed out that we wouldn\u2019t have the time (which he needs alot of attention) my husband pointed out us getting a sitter, which is also something we cannot afford. He won\u2019t take no for an answer and is very upset that I am against it. He said I\u2019m treating his son indifferent, and that I should be supporting him. I love my stepson, but I\u2019m just stating the facts.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "OMFG.I just cannot believe what I just read.\n\nJust imagine that one of YOUR sons has an accident now, and need special medical attention, and then your loving husband, as you say, states the fact that you cannot afford to keep taking care of your son.\n\nHow would you take it?\n\nWoman, if you have to fkin die of starvation, you fkin do it before abandoning a son.\nI cannot even...\n\nYTA. Big time!", "YTA, you\u2019re clearly looking for any reason to say no to this arrangement. It\u2019d be one thing if you were in a tough situation and looking for a helpful compromise where you contribute and help how and where you can, but the fact you immediately jump to no and stick to that answer is why YTA. Would you do the same if it was your kids? How would you feel to be in your husband\u2019s shoes?", "INFO: how involved was your husband as a dad before all this? \n\nI\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NAH, on the assumption that your husband is a good father even though his son doesn\u2019t seem to live with you all the time. \n\nLook, I understand why your husband wants to take him in until his mother gets better. It\u2019s his kid for gods sake. But at the same time you have some valid concerns. You both work most days of the week, and cannot afford a sitter. If you didn\u2019t have a sitter then one of you would probably have to cut down your hours which means you\u2019d be losing money that you\u2019d need to look after a special needs kid, and your other three kids. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re coming from a place of malice, but you\u2019re being practical. I do have to ask how easy would it be for you to get a better paid job? Would you need to increase your skill set or are there just not the right jobs where you are? Because I can understand that. I\u2019ve a degree but there are no jobs that require my degree where I am, and I cannot relocate because I simply don\u2019t have the money. I simply have to make do with a minimum wage job, and try and teach myself coding so I have a hope to get a better job. And it\u2019s hard because I\u2019ve a baby and am sleep deprived. So the point I\u2019m getting at is that I understand if it\u2019s difficult for you not getting a better paying job. \n\nI\u2019d say let your stepsons grandparents take him in, if your husband agrees to it, since it\u2019s his decision at the end of the day. My heart feels for both of you but it may not be practical to take him in. \n\nThe real AH is the system that demands people pay for medical care, that insurance can\u2019t even cover. I\u2019m living in the UK so we are fortunate to have the NHS. Whilst it\u2019s on its knees it\u2019s still better than what america has.

Will things be tight and a struggle for a while? Yes.  Absolutely.

It\u2019s well known that the birth of a child with special needs is often a reason why parents break up and it\u2019s often the mother who then stays with the special needs child. \n\nDid OP and her husband not think if the ex-wife had difficulties parenting the special needs child alone, who seemingly has quite high needs? It honestly makes me question the husband too. If it\u2019s so hard and so difficult, has the ex wife gotten enough help at all?\n\nOP is not okay in her stance either. If you are in a relationship with someone who has kids, it\u2019s a sign of a good parent and a good person if they are strongly involved in the life of their special needs child.

There is also no discussion of division of labor or does the father just assume that his wife can just take on more and more. That's mainly why she's freaking out imo, there isn't really a plan.\n\n  Everyone is slamming the stepmom for having pretty valid concerns.\n\nEdited to add, I have volunteered and coached with Special Olympics for several years and was a teachers assistant for special needs kids for 12 months in high school.
