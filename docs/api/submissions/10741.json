We have 3 children together, twins ages 11, and a 9 year old. My husband has a son14 with Down syndrome and many heart problems. He needs extra attention which we cannot give. He needs extra financial care, which we do not have. He has insurance but it does not cover it all.\n\nHe has been living with his mother, but his mother was just in a car crash. He\u2019s been staying with us for a few days, but his mothers recovery is a long process. It could take up to 8 months- to a year or even longer. She\u2019s had multiple surgeries and her legs were badly damaged, so she\u2019d have to go through physical therapy and may even be placed in a rehab unit after she is released from the hospital. She has asked my husband if we could take care of him for the time being.\n\nMy stepsons maternal grandparents have also offered to help out and take him sometimes during the week or on the weekends. The issue is we both work 6 days out of the week. My husband is the only one with a great paying job, so we get by, we\u2019re comfortable, but adding another child onto that, with expensive health issues, puts us out of that zone. Along with getting utilities paid, and food. A few months ago we had a great financial downfall and lost a lot of money, had to even dig into savings, so this was a reasonable concern.\n\nWhen I brought this up to my husband he was outraged. He said we couldn\u2019t abandon his son, and that I should look for a different job, one to pay better. When I pointed out that we wouldn\u2019t have the time (which he needs alot of attention) my husband pointed out us getting a sitter, which is also something we cannot afford. He won\u2019t take no for an answer and is very upset that I am against it. He said I\u2019m treating his son indifferent, and that I should be supporting him. I love my stepson, but I\u2019m just stating the facts.", "created_utc": 1677186910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a8yxa/aita_for_telling_my_husband_we_cannot_afford_to/", "score": 396, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", "Your concerns are valid but if this was one of your children instead of a stepchild this wouldn\u2019t even be a question.\n\nYou married a man with a disabled son.

Pick out YOUR least favorite kid or 2 and send them to live with your parents or other relatives. That will free up space in your house and money. Then your husband can bring his oldest child to live in his house.

Seriously all the Y T A comments are knee jerk reactions of \u201chow can you be so heartless\u201d when that\u2019s not it all all. You being up totally valid concerns that in taking on this child it puts the rest of your family in jeopardy financially. Voicing those concerns doesn\u2019t make you an AH. Your husband isn\u2019t wrong to be upset either. Any parent would be upset over anybody even suggesting that they can\u2019t care for their kid. I think it\u2019s time to sit down and have a rational discussion about this. If he\u2019s paying child support it needs to be withdrawn the moment the child comes to you (because logically even if you can\u2019t afford it, you know it\u2019s most likely that it\u2019s happening). BM can figure her bills out herself. If she doesn\u2019t have the child the she doesn\u2019t get the child\u2019s money. Also, work out a schedule with the grandparents to help with his care. Does the mom do it all alone or does she have help? Can you all get the same help? Are there any before/after care programs? You husband is kind of being AHish though with the whole \u201cyou go get a better job\u201d comment. Maybe he should get a second job to support his kid. It\u2019s not your fault or your job to handle this situation (including getting a new job or more childcare for his child).", "YTA. Suck it up.

And I\u2019m having trouble understanding why this would be such a terrible increase in financial burden, unless of course you and your husband have not been contributing enough finally this far.

We have 3 children together, twins ages 11, and a 9 year old. My husband has a son14 with Down syndrome and many heart problems. He needs extra attention which we cannot give. He needs extra financial care, which we do not have. He has insurance but it does not cover it all.\n\nHe has been living with his mother, but his mother was just in a car crash. He\u2019s been staying with us for a few days, but his mothers recovery is a long process. It could take up to 8 months- to a year or even longer. She\u2019s had multiple surgeries and her legs were badly damaged, so she\u2019d have to go through physical therapy and may even be placed in a rehab unit after she is released from the hospital. She has asked my husband if we could take care of him for the time being.\n\nMy stepsons maternal grandparents have also offered to help out and take him sometimes during the week or on the weekends. The issue is we both work 6 days out of the week. My husband is the only one with a great paying job, so we get by, we\u2019re comfortable, but adding another child onto that, with expensive health issues, puts us out of that zone. Along with getting utilities paid, and food. A few months ago we had a great financial downfall and lost a lot of money, had to even dig into savings, so this was a reasonable concern.\n\nWhen I brought this up to my husband he was outraged. He said we couldn\u2019t abandon his son, and that I should look for a different job, one to pay better. When I pointed out that we wouldn\u2019t have the time (which he needs alot of attention) my husband pointed out us getting a sitter, which is also something we cannot afford. He won\u2019t take no for an answer and is very upset that I am against it. He said I\u2019m treating his son indifferent, and that I should be supporting him. I love my stepson, but I\u2019m just stating the facts.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "OMFG.I just cannot believe what I just read.\n\nJust imagine that one of YOUR sons has an accident now, and need special medical attention, and then your loving husband, as you say, states the fact that you cannot afford to keep taking care of your son.\n\nHow would you take it?\n\nWoman, if you have to fkin die of starvation, you fkin do it before abandoning a son.\nI cannot even...\n\nYTA. Big time!", "YTA, you\u2019re clearly looking for any reason to say no to this arrangement. It\u2019d be one thing if you were in a tough situation and looking for a helpful compromise where you contribute and help how and where you can, but the fact you immediately jump to no and stick to that answer is why YTA. Would you do the same if it was your kids? How would you feel to be in your husband\u2019s shoes?", "INFO: how involved was your husband as a dad before all this? \n\nI\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NAH, on the assumption that your husband is a good father even though his son doesn\u2019t seem to live with you all the time. \n\nLook, I understand why your husband wants to take him in until his mother gets better. It\u2019s his kid for gods sake. But at the same time you have some valid concerns. You both work most days of the week, and cannot afford a sitter. If you didn\u2019t have a sitter then one of you would probably have to cut down your hours which means you\u2019d be losing money that you\u2019d need to look after a special needs kid, and your other three kids. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re coming from a place of malice, but you\u2019re being practical. I do have to ask how easy would it be for you to get a better paid job? Would you need to increase your skill set or are there just not the right jobs where you are? Because I can understand that. I\u2019ve a degree but there are no jobs that require my degree where I am, and I cannot relocate because I simply don\u2019t have the money. I simply have to make do with a minimum wage job, and try and teach myself coding so I have a hope to get a better job. And it\u2019s hard because I\u2019ve a baby and am sleep deprived. So the point I\u2019m getting at is that I understand if it\u2019s difficult for you not getting a better paying job. \n\nI\u2019d say let your stepsons grandparents take him in, if your husband agrees to it, since it\u2019s his decision at the end of the day. My heart feels for both of you but it may not be practical to take him in. \n\nThe real AH is the system that demands people pay for medical care, that insurance can\u2019t even cover. I\u2019m living in the UK so we are fortunate to have the NHS. Whilst it\u2019s on its knees it\u2019s still better than what america has.

If she didn\u2019t want to help care for a Down syndrome child then she shouldn\u2019t have married the father of one.", "To me, it looks like the grandparents said they can take him and watch him during the week or the weekend sometimes. So not full-time, it doesn\u2019t look like they offered for stepson to live with them, and \u201csometimes\u201d might mean it wouldn\u2019t be reliable care. But, of course, without the op chiming back in, we\u2019re of really sure.", "The grandparents said they could help and take him a few times a week. Not that he could live with them full-time.", "This. I don't get why so many people form a relationship/have kids with someone who already has children/family responsibilities and expect a blank slate.", "I, too, am curious as to what options OP presented because from what they\u2019ve give us it\u2019s just that \u201cno money, can\u2019t\u201d", "All heat questions to be asked. Ide like to know all this as well.", "I tend to say NTA because people in this post seem to think this child as a pet, while he is a kid with special needs and I don\u2019t think that two full time working parents can give him the attentions and time he deserves and needs", "I agree NTA, not your son. But why THREE children if you are not in the best financial situation? And you knew of that son, you and your husband should have think about it before.", "This is what I\u2019m thinking. They knew this whole time this kid would need extra support for his whole life and just carried on as if that wasn\u2019t the case but now it\u2019s \u201cjust stating the facts.\u201d Sorry about your poor planning OP but that\u2019s not a reason to abandon a child in a time of crisis\u2026", "Ikr! She said \"I love my stepson\" - clearly not since she has no empathy towards him and what he's going through. She's not \"stating facts\", she's ignoring the fact that this kid is a human being who needs his dad's love and support more than ever. All because it'll financially impact her and \"her kids\" a bit. Ppl like this are so infuriating. YTA big time", "Op clearly doesn\u2019t love her stepson", "I was thinking about him having to pay child support as well, those funds could free up money for some sort of care.  \n\nI do understand the OP's dilemma though, this is her husbands child and yet she is the one that most likely bear the brunt of his care with her husband being the main wage earner.  \n\nOP, rather than straight out saying no, have a discussion on how this is going to logistically work.  With 3 children already, I imagine you already are stretched pretty thin.", "Temporary is a day or two or maybe a week or two. 8+ months is NOT temporary and as I have a special needs child myself I can say with some experience that it definitely impacts the budget. Is it fair? Nope but then again life isn't fair for any of us. She's not the AH for pointing out the logistics and the issues. They need to sit down and figure it out, so every kid is taken care of.", ">Instead of blaming on your diminishing resources, ask yourself why you\u2019re so up and arms about taking in your stepson.\n\nWhy are \"diminishing resources\" not a good enough reason? It's weird you'd assume she doesn't want a kid with DS around her children when \"we have neither the time nor the money to provide addequate support\" is a perfectly valid reason.", "Grandparents and sitter.", "This one is up there near the top for sure.", "The husband is an AH too because he clearly left all the caretaking to his ex and never had any accommodations for his son at his and his wife\u2019s house. Maybe he spends time with him. Who knows. But that doesn\u2019t make a dad. His son was just an oversight as he moved on with his life. ESH for just diminishing this child\u2019s existence. And OP wouldn\u2019t hesitate to jump through hoops if he we her child", "The title got me right away. The husband isn't \"taking in\" his own child. He's being a parent. And frankly if my spouse acted like this about my hypothetical kid I'd be questioning my choice of partner, because this is so unsupportive and callous. OP loves stepson...as long as she doesn't have to live with him or be involved with him in any way.", "Dude\u2026. I mean no ill will but YTA for this comment. It is very common for the mother to get custody, unless she is deemed fit. The comments do not show any evidence (unless I missed it then I\u2019m sorry) of this guy abandoning his kid. Divorce sucks but it does happen.", "Exactly there is always room for help if you ask people, instead of complaining online she could have started a fundraiser if you really can't handle the Finances. \n\nIf someone's is 'getting paid well' then when you are frugal you can afford the child.", "\u261d\ud83c\udffbthis right here.", "INFO: Married for 12 years, and husband has a 14 year old son?

It\u2019s unbelievable how some people can marry someone with a child(ren) and then get upset about their spouse actually parenting said child. \n\nIf OP couldn\u2019t make parenting a special needs child work for her, then she should never have married someone with a special needs child.", "Not even a right, it\u2019s his responsibility to take care of his son.", "Well then the husband should be the one looking for a better job. They work six days a week and GET BY. That\u2019s not super comfortable that\u2019s getting by. Then he\u2019s suggesting a sitter when Op is working more hours, which is more money coming out the house they can\u2019t afford. Op is literally in an impossible situation", ">just stating the facts", "Some step parents don\u2019t seem to realise that there step children are just as much a priority to there partner as the children they have with them, just because she birthed those children and not the step son doesn\u2019t make her husband any less that child\u2019s father", "Either way somebody is going to be prioritized over the other. This child has extensive needs and big financial medical issues. If they bring him in they are prioritizing him over the rest of the family. That\u2019s why I said they need to sit down, file to withdraw all child support, work with the grandparents for childcare and find community support to fill in where they can get them. If bringing this child in full time is going to cause them to not be able to financially provide for everybody then it\u2019s not going to do anybody any good if they all end up destitute.", "He\u2019s worse if he abandons his child and stays with this woman!", "She probably thinks they can just take him to the pound.", "My DH has a child from a former marriage.  The ex has primary custody.  Every night I pray nothing happens to the ex, but I would never dream of not taking in his son if something did happen to her.", "Her kids are 11 and 9 years old.

Their financial situation may have been entirely different when they had kids a decade-ish ago.\n\nIt's not like you can send kids back if your finances change...", "Her \"love\" ends once it can't be shown on her terms.", "She knew what she was getting into by marrying someone who already had a kid.", "these responses are crazy to me honestly. this situation isn\u2019t fair to anyone, especially the son and OP\u2019s bio kids with her husband\u2014OP is coming across as very sober here. the son will very clearly experience a radical diminishment in care and support if home care or a residential support program can\u2019t be arranged.", "It\u2019s not a valid reason. They are able to care for him it\u2019s just put some strain on them, oh well! Maybe she shouldn\u2019t of made a bunch of kids with a man who already had a kid if she didn\u2019t want to ever be put out. What\u2019s wrong some people. Something happened now the father must make sure his son is taken care of even if it\u2019s putting some strain on time and money. \n\nYTA BTW", "OMG I totally misread, I thought the son was with the husband\u2019s mom, not his own mom (which I see here a lot). Totally take that back", "Easier to get a better job than abandon your son you would hope but she didn\u2019t even consider it", "Whatever the impossible situation they are in, abandoning his son is not an option.", "They shouldn\u2019t. But he shouldn\u2019t get mad at Op for pointing out their financial problems either, because she has the right to bring up those concerns because their legitimate concerns. She\u2019s not some evil witch y\u2019all are trying make her. If anything, he should\u2019ve said HE\u2019LL get another job, but to say op needs to get another job is just wild.", "It\u2019s wild? OP very clearly states that her husband has a great paying job that allows them to live comfortably and she does not. She works 6 days a week, doesn\u2019t make great pay, and is stressed about finances. OP getting a higher paying job is quite literally the best solution to their problem. \n\nI wonder why finances are suddenly a huge concern. Have they not been supporting their son financially the last 14 years? Sounds like the poor kid\u2019s mother has been doing all the heavy lifting. OP can suck it up for the next 12 months."]}
